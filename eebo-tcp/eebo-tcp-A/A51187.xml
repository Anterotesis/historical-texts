            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<q>My most honourable Lord, you know that I am your true and lawful Wife, yet never was in in hope of Child till now, or that by me your name should survive: Therefore I conjure you by the pleasures of your youth, and the dear and natural love you bear unto the Infant conceived in my Womb, that either by art, wisodome, or some other inspiration you calculate upon my trouble; some dreams, and tell me what they are; For night by night no sooner doth sweet sleep seize upon my sences, but I dream that I am conceived of a dreadful fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand, the which shall set on fire our Mansion House:</q>

But long had not the young Lad bin there, but according to his usual course he sowed such seeds of dissention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Boyes, that instead of their former obedience and respect, they exercised now nothing but rebellion and disobedience: It was enough for the Master who before could frown every Schollar he had into a loosness, now to beseech them to lay down their Brick-brats. His Wife too, who had before so long been loving to him, now scolds at him like a Butter-whore, and he hates her that so late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was so dear to him. Fathers complaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Master fumes, the Mistress rants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Husband vexes; in a word, all things are so much out of order, that Sir Pedagogue preferring his present peace before his future advancement resolves to carry back this <hi>primum mobile</hi> of mischiefe, for such he soon discovered him to be. to his own Parent, not being able him else longer to endure the trouble of his vexatious contrivances: When the ancient Seer beheld his Son so soon return'd unto him he said unto the Peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, <hi>What are the seven years expir'd already?</hi> Then said the Pedagogue, I well know Sir Knight, that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years are not yet expired; but so great do I find the capacity of your Son, that should I keep him as my poor <hi>gymnasyolum,</hi> I should both wrong you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and injure the

Youth: Therefore have I restor'd him to you again, that you may provide for him according to his wonderful and most forward genius. The crasty Fox his Father too well knew the disposition of his young Cub, therefore said he unto the Pedagogue, O no! This is not the cause of my Sons so soon return, I fear something worse, and therefore I conjure thee to tell me the truth: Was hee not wont to set thee and thy Boys together by the eares? Did she not cause much strife and contention between thee and thy Wife, so that neither thou, nor they, nor she could rest in quiet for him:
To which the Pedagogue made answer, that since he must confess the truth, 'twas even as he had said, and no otherwise. At which words of the Pedagogue, the old man shook his head as if he would have shaken his teeth out of his mouth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he was very sorrowful to hear of the evil courses which his yong Son p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hither the little Fox came, his Father intending that he should be in this place terrified out of all his designs: But what mortal is able to stop the course of the splendiferous Son, who can quell the raging Boreas, or change the wilde nature of the roaring Lion? Even so impossible was it to drive back the ill nature of this Youth, though it were with Pitch-forks; wherefore he went on in his old trade, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in practise his wonted spells and magical words: the effects whereof did presently appear, for in a little while the Schollars were all in an uproar, some would only study on holy dayes, and play upon working dayes, others would begin at the end of their Books, and read toward the beginning, saying it was the best way, and that the <hi>Preceptor</hi> was a Dunce: Then because that one of the <hi>Preceptors</hi> knowing the dangerous consequence of these innovations, st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sirrha quoth the <hi>Gyant of the Kings School,</hi> what fury hath possessed thy overwhelmed mind, proud princock thus to adventure thy feeble contrivances against the violence of my strong arm: The Youth though confounded with the threatning words of the Gyant, durst not deny what he knew was so well known; and therefore he sought to put it off with an <hi>Allegory,</hi> for he was full sore afraid of the Gyant, who had then in his hand a great Tree which he mannaged with as much dexterity, as if it had been a <hi>Ferula</hi>; Sir Gyant, quoth he, I do deny that ere I advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed any Person to break the <hi>Preceptors</hi> neck.

Then the Gyant caused his breeches to be taken down, and his shixt to be taken up, and with his Tree so nimbly bestirred himself, and laid such vehement blows upon his flesh, that they seemed to shake the Earth.

When the Elders of the Land saw the confusion which was likely to happen, they resolved to remove the cause of their mischief; therfore they went to Sir <hi>Vane</hi> and sharply rebuking him, bid him prepare to be gone out of their Countrey, for that they had provided a ship, &amp; a Coach to carry him to the sea.

That the Rulers of the Earth must be brought at last to serve him and his faction; That his people are not to be subject to the Iudicials of <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>When the High Priest heard him speak these things he marvelled very much, and greatly praised him, for that quoth he, if these things were well taught, and well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiv'd, they would doubtlesse destroy the religion of the Christians, who are our most mortall enemies. Then did
<pb facs="tcp:32507:11"/>
the High Priest bow unto Sir <hi>Vane</hi> saying to him, Thou art in power, and as thou endeavourest to doe our work so is it fit that thou shouldst receive honour from us. 'Tis true quoth he, thou art a Knight after the order of the Christians, but throw it off, for it will be very injurious unto thee; and take from me a title which shall be more beneficiall, and comfort thy self in this that then thou shalt be a better Knight then any in the World. Then did the High Priest aske him whether he could fight or no. To which Sir <hi>Vane</hi> reply'd that he never could nor never would fight. The High Priest was right glad of this, for that he could now performe the office himself by anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereas otherwise he must have been forc'd to have sent for a Warriour on purpose to have dub'd him. Thus the High Priest took leave for the time, telling him that in thrée days he would returne; desiring him in that space to prepare himselfe for the honour he was to receive. He was to eate nothing but emblematicall dyet, as round cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bages which seeme to resemble the Earth, and its destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by fire, in that they are to be boyl'd before they can be eaten. He was likewise to feed upon Swines flesh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a Hog was the embleme of ingratitude: he might likewise feed upon Horse flesh, because the Bible spake much of them, and that eating them out of the way was the only means to keep Men from not putting their trust in them; He might drink botled Claret by reason of its emblematicall life and quickness, and he might likewise take Tobacco if his Pipe had this motto on it, <hi>Evanescit ut su nus;</hi> but he was forbid to drink Greek Wine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that the Christians us'd it at their Communions.</p>
                     <p>In the mean while the High Priest, being loath to defile so great a solemnity with any oyle that had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallow'd by the touch of the Christians, sent two of his Disciples to cut off a great peice of a certaine Whale which was kil'd a little before in the River of <hi>Thame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore when the overgrown Childe had dressed himself as fine as any fippence, he called straightway for his Fathers Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, and bid the Charioter drive unto the Palace of Sir <hi>Lambert</hi>: When he came unto the Gate, the Porter oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soones opened the Gate, that he might have entrance; Then was he straightway beheld by one of the Pages to the <hi>Fair Maid,</hi> who with great reverence met him and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him to the chamber where his Lady did repose her self; When the overgrown Childe came into the room, he was excéedingly amazed to behold the beauty of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strisse, so that he remained dumb for a great space.

Therefore except thou grant me kind comfort, I am like to spend the rest of my dayes in sorrow, care and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. To this the <hi>Fair Maid of Wimbleton</hi> reply'd, that she return'd him many thanks for the courteous proffer of his affection.

When it was known that the two parties had got one the others affection, the Bonefires blaze, the Bells rang, and Sir <hi>Lambert</hi> and Sir <hi>Vane</hi> were both drunk that night for joy. Then were there great preparations for the solemnization of these most Royal Nuptials, but that which surpassed all, was the Gown in which she was to appear when she was to goe unto the Temple; indéed so great was the rarity of it, that it requires a golden Pen to write it, and a tongue washt in the conservatives of the Muses honey, to declare it; for it was to be made of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, set in Kings of Barbery Gold. The toyle was great, so that it required a multitude of Artificers to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the same; therefore they sought far and near for Men of Art, and in a short space they got together to the number of five thousand, who wrought day and night in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral employments to carry on the great work. These Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds were all enchanted by Magick Art, and the vertues of them were so pretious, that it is almost incredible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: For therein one might behold the secret mysteries of all the liberal Sciences, and by art discover what was

First and formost there fore, knowing that they must take assunder what was already established, before they could put their own together, they resolv'd to abolish wholly the Religion of the <hi>Christians,</hi> for that it was so opposite to what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that it was impossible for them to let the least title thereof remain: And because it is no hard matter to beware by other mens harmes, séeing that the too much pretending to knowledge among the vulgar Christians) It being dangerous for any person to have more knowledge then he is able to mannage) had been the cause of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion; they resolv'd to reforme that error, and to take from the people all meanes of diving into hidden things, to which end they had order'd that all Schooles of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should be taken away; and so far they were from have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any teachers among the people, that they order'd it should be death for any one to teach his children the primer, Yet because they knew that the aw of a deity was very necessary, though never so airy and nationall, Sir <hi>Lambert</hi> being now chiefe Soldan caus'd Proclamation to be made whereby the God of the Christians was depos'd and eight other deities erected in his roome; Four of these deities were of the feminine gender and four of the newter; Of the female deities two were Latine <hi>Destinia,</hi> and <hi>Ig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

divine worship unto these, and that these onely should be ador'd as the onely and most supreame Gods powers over the Earth, as to future expectations Sir <hi>Vane</hi> took it all from <hi>Mahomet,</hi> changing little or nothing; Having thus setled religion, they procéed to alter the civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Sir <hi>Lambert</hi> said that he did not like the lawes, and therefore would have new ones; but sir <hi>Vane</hi> sade it was altogether unnecessary as yet to have any at all, for that necessity would compell their party to be yet a while unanimous and loving one to another, and if the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had any lawes to fly to, it would hinder their party for dstroying those their enemies, which was to be done no other way but by giving their party leave to practice all manner of tyrannies and violencies over them.</p>
                     <p>Yet one law sir <hi>Vane</hi> liked well that it should be made, which was a law against the importing of Barrel-Figgs, least thereby the <hi>Christians</hi> should learne <hi>Unity,</hi> séeing things of the same nature stick so close together. Then in imitation of <hi>Joshua</hi> who drave out the <hi>Canaanites</hi> shéere out of the Land to give his people a full possession thereof, they intended to have destroy'd all the old inhabitants of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> both Nobles, Gentry and Yeomen, by making their own party Lords over them, who were all of a new race, as being the Sons of the Earth, and such therefore whom no tyes of consanguinity had interest to make them in the least wise mercifull; When these things were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulg'd among the Christians, there was a famous divine among them that went to Sir <hi>Vane</hi> to reason the case with him, Quoth he unto him, it is a very dangerous thing to alter the religion, and take away the Laws of a Nation; Sir <hi>Vane</hi> replyes, that as to the alteration of religion, it was a thing which they thought convenient, and therefore since they had the power in their hands, they were resolv'd to doe it; and as for taking away the Laws, he thought 'twas very well done also; for that was the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween théeves and honest men, Théeves indéed were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
<pb facs="tcp:32507:25"/>
to make Laws among themselves, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them; but honest Men, said he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such as we and our party, have no néed thereof; for that we are no théeves, but robbers; and if we doe possesse other Mens goods, it is because we have right thereunto, being born to inherit the Earth; Alas quoth Sir <hi>Vane,</hi> Laws are the guides of the soule, and therefore those who would be counted most frée, ought to live without um; for if it be a mark of sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to have the legs or hands bound, certes it is a signe of far greater subjection to suffer the mind to be in fetters. When the ancient Seer heard these arguments he was convinc'd, not by the strength of Sir <hi>Vane's</hi> reason, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he saw it was in vaine to contend with an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable strength; &amp; therefore with great sorrow for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction which he saw was like to fall upon the Christians, he took his leave of the <hi>Knight of the mysterious Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and departed.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. XVII. How the Seer <hi>Wareston</hi> lay with a Lady of pleasure that came to him with a Petition upon the Councel Table, and what happened thereupon.</head>
                     <p>LEave we now Sir <hi>Lambert</hi> a while, and let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse what happen'd at the <hi>Councel of Safety,</hi> of which the <hi>Seer Wareston</hi> was Chief President, who was a right notable Knave and exceeding salacious, as you shall understand by that which follows. There was a Lady at that time, who had certain sad occasions co visit the Councel of Safety for the redress of certain grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, but could never find a fit opportunity to deliver her supplication; but at length finding that the <hi>Seer Wareston</hi> was all alone in the Councel Chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with mony of the Dore keeper to let her in. When she came in, she appeared right comely unto <hi>the Seer,</hi> and related her Story unto him with such a grace, that he was streight-way enamoured of her; Quoth he, <hi>well do you deserve fair Lady to have your Petition granted, but should I grant you your Petition, would you grant me mine? Alas!</hi> said the Lady, <hi>it is not for you to petition, who
<pb facs="tcp:32507:27"/>
have so much power in your hands. Ah!</hi> reply'd the Seer, <hi>you have wounded me; and I hope you will cure the wound which you have made,</hi> and saying these words, he pulled her by the Gown upon his knee as he sate in his great Chair, and would have kissed her. The Lady not ignorant, how much coyns inflamed, made great resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; but the more she resisted, the more was he on fire; so that there was exceeding great contention, and strung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling between them; at length the lustful Seer being the stronger, had thrown her upon the Councel Table, and there laid her flat on her back, where at length she gave him leav to quench his desires with the spoils of her seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chastity, on condition that he would grant her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. He had not sooner finished, but in came <hi>Sir Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> the contemptible Knight, and some others, who seeming the <hi>Seer</hi> in a strange posture, with his Band rumpled, his Cap off, the Sleeve of his Gown torn, and his Face more redder then ordinary, desired to know of him what had happen'd unto him. The Seer not at all abashed told them the whole Story: Who entred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon into great consultations among themselves. Some were of an opinion, that since the <hi>Seer Wareston</hi> Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy was likely to encrease, that the <hi>Sold'an</hi> should allow him a larger stipen'd, One stood up and said that it was requisite, that the <hi>Contemptible Knight,</hi> and the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Allegories</hi> should be sent to the Temple of the Gods, <hi>La potta del Papa Giovanna,</hi> to enquire of the Oracle, whither it were a Boy or a Girle, that provision for the birth and education might be made accordingly. Others were of opinion that 'twas convenient to know what his Name should be; This debate took up above a weeks time, with continual <hi>pro's</hi> and <hi>con's,</hi> and at length they concluded that it were a Boy he should be called by the Name of young <hi>FINBRANDUS,</hi> and that he should be sent to the enchanted Castle <hi>NEW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GATE,</hi> to be bred up in all the secrets of that place
<pb facs="tcp:32507:27"/>
by the severall Gyants yhat frequented the Castle. But if it were a Girle that she should be delivered to witch <hi>Creswellia</hi> to be taught all kind of sorceries and enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and so the Councell was dismist for that time.</p>

Now you must know that before Sir <hi>Lambert</hi> departed out of the good City of <hi>London</hi> there came unto him the Seer <hi>Feko</hi> High Priest in the Temple of the Idoll, icleped <hi>Foutre le Diable,</hi> and the Seer <hi>Rogero</hi> High Priest of the Idoll <hi>Cuzzo nel Culo</hi> and Declared unto him, how they had that night seen a Uision, and having told what they had seen each unto the other, that they had both Dreamed the same Dream; Me thought quoth the Seer <hi>Feko,</hi> that I was in a great field, where I saw sir <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert's</hi> Horse feeding among a multitude of other Horses, when on a sudden sir <hi>Lambert's</hi> horse elevating his rump set an exceeding great Fart, so that ths Noise thereof caused the Ualleys to sound and the Hills to eccho, and with the strength thereof blew away all the laid Horses, so that when I looked about again, I could not sée one Horse left. Now while I was musing upon the strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the accident, there came a young man to me cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in Blew, who bid me declare what I had seen unto Sir <hi>Lambert,</hi> for that as his Horse had Farted away all

the other horses, so should he scatter all his enemies. When sir <hi>Lambert</hi> heard this, he caused his Butler to be sent for, and commauded him to carry the two high Priests into the Buttery, and set the Bread and Chéese before them and to give them as much Ale as they would drink; which assoon as he had faid he gollop'd away as fast as he could to encounter the <hi>Loyal Knight.</hi> Now after that he had béen gone a good while, it hapn'd one morni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now such was the hast he was in, that because he could not readily find his own Arins he was forced to put on his head, a great iron porridge pot which was next at hand; instead of his shield he took the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Christians hearing of his coming, shut the Gates of the City, thinking to kéep him out; but the Gyant pusht them open, with as much ease, as if they had béen made of Past-board; and finding his own Shield defective, he made use of one of the Gates for his Buckler all that day. Yet notwithstanding his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, the Christians continued playing at Football, not dreaming that their sport had béen offensive. But so it fell out, that one of the Christians striking the Ball right strenuous, by which his foot kick'd the Ball full in the Gyants Face, so that his Eye was in greatdanger. The Gyant who had but one Eye, and being jealous that the Christians intended to put out that too, was sorely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged; wherefore in great fury he laid about him with his huge Elm among the multitude, killing six of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians

at one blow; which the Christians beholding they incontinently fled away: That, when the Gyant <hi>Huso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> saw, he thought it good time to satisfie his hunger, as well as his revenge.

                     <p>WHen Sir <hi>Lambert</hi> saw that he could not get unto the <hi>Loyal Knight,</hi> who séeing himself far unequal to sir <hi>Lambert</hi> in number, kept himself in his strong Holds; he thought upon a way how to kéep the <hi>Loyall Knight</hi> from coming to him: he saw his souldiers wanted work, and therefore to kéep them from mutining, and being idle, which two inconveniences commonly go together, like a Citizen and his wife, He gave them a command that they should build up a Wall in the Land of <hi>Northumbria,</hi> the which in bredth should reach from sea to sea, and in height up unto the clouds, and which should be so thick that fifty Coaches might go a brest; and to secure it from the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-thumping-bullets of the dismall-noise-making Canon, he sent for the <hi>Seer Feko</hi> to enchant it. Now where Travellers were to passe to and fro, he ordered that there should be a great Gate made of Massie Brasse, which should be bolted with Bolts as big about as an ordinary Stéeple, the <hi>Shooter</hi> of the Lock was to be as broad as an Acre of Ground; Then said the Artificer unto Sir <hi>Lambert,</hi> Who shall turn the Key? and Sir <hi>Lambert</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let there be a Mill to turn it. Now as Sir <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> was contriving about this wall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir <hi>Vane</hi> hearing of his design, sent him a Letter; the substance whereof was, that he had heard of the Wall which he was going to build; and therefore he advised him, because Love would break through stone walls to make it of Brick: in
<pb facs="tcp:32507:32"/>
answer to which Sir <hi>Lambert</hi> sent him another, wherein he assured him that the Wall should be of Brick accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and that if he would not believe him, he might come down and sée. Sir <hi>Lambert</hi> had a double Design in making this wall; First, because that being he was not ignorant that his souldiers must dig very deep to lay the foundations of such a wall, he knew nothing to the contrary but that they might find some Mine or other whereby to enrich both themselves and him, but his main drift was to kéep the <hi>Loyal Knight</hi> from coming into <hi>Britain</hi>: moreover this wall was to be guarded by never-sléeping Dragons, which were to be sent for from <hi>Lydia,</hi> as also by Mastiff Dogs, which were to be kept hungry for that purpose. You'l say now he was in a fair way: but woe unto a man when ill luck follows him. Now said the Knight of the golden <hi>Tulip</hi> unto himself, shall I have such a wall, as there will not be in the world such another, nor was there ever such a one before? Travellers shall come to see this wall of mine, from all parts of the Earth, and shall bring mony in their pockets and shall enrich my Land; then will I plant Apricocks and Peaches against this wall, and when they are ripe I will say unto my wife, <hi>lo, the fruits of my Wall.</hi> While he was thus solacing himself under his wall, came unto him the sad news how that the <hi>Forty Tyrants</hi> were got into power again, and that <hi>Don Hazlerigo</hi> with an Army had forced all his one and twenty <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the forty Tyrants though they had vanquished Sir <hi>Lambert,</hi> did not yet enjoy their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ease and quiet, for they were sorely press'd upon by the Loyal Knight, and the rest of the Christans that were with him, who were indeed too Cunning for them; For the Loyal Knight seeing that his Forces were not powerful enough for them, at first feigned himself to be a Pagan likewise, at which they were right glad, and commanded him to pull down the Gates of the City of <hi>Londinum,</hi> which when he had done, they said one to another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now the Town's ours, for they thought that they had made the Loyal Knight Cock sure to them, but when he saw how they had abused him, he called for one of the City Gyants, who was seven yards high, and fifteen foot about the waste, and bid him go and pull those proud and furious Dominatours from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

'Tis well quoth the Gyant that I give you time to consider of the evil which ye have done, and that I do not presently gobble you up, as for example with that; It is reported for certain, that he took up the Séer <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nellolanelus,</hi> and having first rubb'd him betwéen his fore-finger and his thumb, as they do damsons, to make him tender, he toss'd him into his mouth, and swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him whole, the which I take to be more probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath since been much sought after and could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be found, nor so much as heard of. When the Séer <hi>Lisle</hi> saw that, he was full sore afraid, for quoth he, <hi>There is no man that deserveth lesse from the Christians than I have done</hi>; For ye must know my dearly beloved friends, that this Samen Seer was one of the chief of the forty Tyrants, who upon all occasions did sentence the innocent Christians to death, sitting upon a Throne made for that purpose, clad in Scarlet and fine Linnen. Wherefore espying his opportunity, he ran hastily away from the face of the Gyant, and fled unto a certain Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle which appertained to the Witch who was called the <hi>Sable-brow'd-Enchantresse,</hi> which stood near the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let of <hi>Bloomesbury,</hi> where he remained hidden certain days under the Coats of one of the Harlots of that place, till the heat of the search <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now trust me, and how is it in the power of man to help it? For as the proverb saith right well, <hi>Fortune is fickle</hi>; so that there is nothing more inconstant than wayward For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.

For quoth he, <q>Great Soldan thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hests are just, therefore have I forsaken the God of the Christians, to serve the God whom thou servest, and to submit to thee in all things; for who is like unto thee among all the Princes in the world.</q>
There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was without delay cloathed in Skarlet, and a Throne was provided for him where he might sit in majesty to exercise cruelty as he pleased upon the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tressed Christians; and indeed so dextrous was he and Lordly in his office, that few or none of the Christians escaped his bloody sentences. Wherefore the Soldan was right glad, and it pleased him to see that the Seer was so faithful unto him; Therefore he gave unto him the Lands and Palaces of the Christian Princes, so that the Seer lived right illustriously, his heart being at eafe and wallowing in plenty. But as after Winter cometh Summer, and after Summer cometh Winter again as after fair weather cometh fowl, and after fowl fair, so after the long tranquility which our Seer enjoy'd, ensued the boystrous storms of heart killing sorrow: for loe he that before look'd big and haughty,

<q>But quoth he into what Country shall I go? shall I go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Swedland</hi>? no: why? first and formost because that in that place the Winters are long and the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers are short. Secondly, because the Summers are short and the Winters are long. Thirdly and lastly, because it is an unfortunate Country, and they can never keep what they get, which is too much my own condition.

No I will go into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> for that is a pleasant Country, and because the people of that Country be of my own Religion, and there lived the Iewes, of whose number was <hi>Achan,</hi> from whom I am lineally descended by the Fathers side: and though there be no Kings, yet there be Tyrants, who are men after my own heart; And I will go into <hi>Aegypt</hi> because of the Red-sea, for ye must know that I have been bred up near Red seas most part of my life, and was a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of Red seas my self; Therefore as it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Ducks, Teal, and Mallard to frequent the shores of great Rivers, as also of the Ocean, and as it is the nature of the <hi>Soland</hi> Gec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hereupon he entred into a very great Consultation, and debate concerning what was to be done with the <hi>Sable-browd-Inchantresse,</hi> and other of his Friends; some were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that he should wrap himself in a Lyons skin, and so walk to the sea-shore upon all four; But this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize was left off, because that after they had tryed the Sage three or four times, they found him very insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to roar, of which there was an exceeding great necessity, if the Country people should come too near to view or handle him as he went along. But there was nothing that pleas'd him so well as the way which last of all he devised with himself which was to put on a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewig and a Beard of Camels hair, for quoth he a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel is a Beast that beareth great burthens, and I bear a great burthen of woe and misery, and therefore since I must carry this great burthen, it is fit that I should be as like a Camel as I may. Then did the <hi>Sable-browd-Inchantress</hi> send away incontinently three spirits <hi>Rim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bombo, Nachor,</hi> and <hi>Rantantamboro</hi> into <hi>Arabia</hi> to fetch away the tails of 4 Camels, who went and came in less than a quarter of an hour, for they went as if the Divel had drove um, which is 10000. mile in a minute. When the <hi>Sable-browd-Enchantress</hi> had the Camels tails in her possession, then did she with wonderful Art

frame thereof a certain large Perewig, the locks where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of reached down to his middle, and it was very grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and comely to behold. Now when the Sage had put it on, he and the <hi>Enchantress</hi> communed together in this wise. Quoth he, most renowned <hi>Mariana,</hi> for so was the <hi>Sable browd-Enchantress</hi> nam'd, who do I now look like? for certes it cannot be that I should be taken for who I am indeed, No quoth she, my most worthy Séet; It is for thy sake that I have run my self into very great hazzads, nor would I by any means that after all the pain which I have taken, that thy face should be no whit alter'd; But be thou assured that the Gods have prosper'd my undertakings, for thou lookest not like thy self, but thou lookest even like <hi>Hector</hi> of <hi>Troy</hi>; Most assuredly I could like <hi>Circe</hi> have chang'd thée into a Swine, but I thought it better that thou shouldst look rather like <hi>Hector</hi> than a Hog. Most cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Enchantress</hi> replied the Seer, I can never end celebrating your most high and more than humane Art, especially in the curling of my Perewig, which is done with so much art that I never saw the like in all my life. Gentle-Seer, replied the <hi>Enchantress,</hi> know right well, that so great is the respect which I bear unto thee, both in respect of the kindnesse which I have received from thee, and which thou hast afforded unto my Damsells, that I would not thou shouldst want any assistance that I can afford thee. Therefore now I call it to mind, there is one <hi>Gyges,</hi> who is in great esteem with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous sir <hi>Pluto</hi> Knight of the Infernal shades, who hath a Ring, the vertue whereof is such, that he who ever wears the same shall walk invisible; That quoth the Seer would be of great advantage unto me, and I would when I had made use of it return it unto sir <hi>Gyges</hi> with all possible speed, and the choicest of my courteous thanks, Hereupon <hi>Rimbombo, Nachor,</hi> and <hi>Rantantamboro</hi> were again dispatch'd unto sir <hi>Gyges,</hi>

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he would in courtesse lend her his Ring, the which had such excellent vertue, that she might pleasure a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tressed Knight who was one of her Friends, who had great occasion thereof, Sir <hi>Gyges</hi> replied that he was alwayes courteous unto distressed Knights, and had no less respect to the <hi>Sable-browd-Enchantress,</hi> so that he was right sorry that he could not do as she desired, for that he had lost the Ring that she sent for most unfortunately; for having left it off one morning when he went to wash his hands, the Damsel of the Castle swept it away. and threw it among the rubbish out of the Castle gates. When the Sage <hi>Lisle</hi> and the Inchantresse heard this, they were right sorry, and were ready to weep for the anguish that fell upon their Spirits. But quoth the <hi>Sable-browd-Inchantresse,</hi> since I cannot have that, I will try my Spels for another. So she prepared all things in a readinesse, and first she drew a large long Circle, which was the strangest that ever was séen, In the midst of this Circle they placed a Bed, the which had never béen lain in before, into which the Sage <hi>Lisle</hi> was commanded to enter, and put himself naked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Shéets. Then the Inchantresse sitting down upon the Bed side, uttered several Charms in the Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonian language, at the end whereof there arose from the four corners of the wind, four black Horses, with Spirits on their backs, in the shape of Monkeys, who demanded of the Enchantresse what was her pleasure, who presently commanded them to fetch unto her one of the Nimphs of the Hesperian Orchard, who presently hurr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:32507:45"/>
seemed unto the eye as plump as a Patridge, and as rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as a Queen Apple. Being come, the Inchantresse caused her to be laid in the Bed, by the side of the Sage <hi>Lisle,</hi> then drawing the Curtains and telling the Seer, that if he us'd the fair Uirgin well, that he should have his hearts desire. She departed out of the Room. Now when the Seer and the Uirgin were alone in Bed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they enjoyed one the other all that night in a most pleasant wise, so that the fair <hi>Philothera</hi> for so was the Uirgin ycleped, having received great content from the Seer <hi>Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For to tell thee truth, right worthy Seer, I am the Soul of a Poulterers Wife, who when my Husband broke, was preserved by the Charity of such Knights as frequented this Castle, to which I was daily invited by the Inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse, how I came hither again, I know not, however I have reason to give thee thanks <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was made o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

being taken from the Sea Mare at that nick of time though it were as light as a feather, it became as hard as steel. The frame thereof was like a Sedan, the Poles thereof were smaller than the smallest Needles. Now the Inchantresse having prepared all things ready, took the Seer and put him into the Charriot, together with a Bottle of Aniseed-water, and four Tabern Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets; then she embraced and kissed the Seer, and hug'd him, giving unto him a Bird-Call, telling him that he should soon find the vertue thereof, and bidding him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all be sure that he never left whistling till he came into <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And indeed so-cunningly had she charmed this <hi>Bird-Call,</hi> that as soon as the Seer began to whistle, there came four <hi>Ostriches,</hi> which placing themselves under the four Poles of the Charriot, spread their wings, and being mounted high into the Air, steered their course di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the Land of King <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> The Inchantress with heavy sorrow look'd after him, till the noise of other Knights knocking at her Castle Gate called her to look after her other affairs.</p>

it now with me. When he had uttered these speeches he called for an Astrologer and a Book of Mapps.
<figure/>
Then quoth he unto the Astrologer, where is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Mountain in the World, and where may I be most likely to find a Den? The Astrologer estsoones reply'd, that men of his Profession did not look after Mountains in this World: but if he would go into the World of the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the Gyant <hi>Husonio</hi> heard that he waxed exceeding wroth, and took the Astrologer upon the palm of his hand, and thrust him into his mouth, as you would put a brown Loaf into an
<pb facs="tcp:32507:46"/>
Oven, with a Peel. Quoth he to the Seer or Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, either find me out a better Mountain and a Den, or tarry there, for till that time thou shalt have no other Study but this; and therefore sit thee down upon one of the stumps of my teeth, and consider of it. Now you must know that the Astrologer being so near his ears could not choose but put many things therein: Among the rest he put thereinto a certain great and puissant Flea: Hoh quoth the Gyant, what's that? It is reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Astrologer, the <hi>Spirit Pipantabor,</hi> who is to conduct thee in the Roads and in thy Iourneys. When he heard that, he was well pleas'd, for he was right well contented therewith, although many times it tickled him full sore. But it now was high time for the Gyant to take up his Pack, for that he was informed of the hot pursuit which the Loyal Knight made after him, whom he dreaded more than the Dove doth the Eagle. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gyant incontinently took his Club, and thrust it into a Ring which was as big about as a Charriot Wheel, whereunto was fastened a Cloak-bag, which was near a quarter of a mile about, and a quarter of a mile in length; for it was as thick as it was long, and as long as it was thick; when he had so done, he laid his Club upon his shoulder, and his Pack hung behind like a Hare upon a Hunters Staffe; Then putting one legge before another, he began his Iourney, praying for a good successe all the way as he went unto the Spirit <hi>Pipantabor,</hi> in this manner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>O thou mighty <hi>Pipantabor,</hi> who dwellest in the car of a great Gyant, yet fearest not the quagmires of wax which are therein, hearken unto my words, and listen to my sayings, as a Chambermaid listens to hear the private discourse of her Master and Mistriss.

The Fart as it was great so it was strong, and the sent thereof so much offended the Nose of <hi>Thetis,</hi> that she was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to endure it; O come away <hi>Neptune</hi> quoth she, and do not poyson thy self and me too; Let my Bason and Ewer go to the Divel, so as I may but get out of this stink, I care not, <hi>Neptune,</hi> unto whom <hi>Thetis</hi> was always dear, would not displease her but retired; yet in his retreat resolving to have one blow, struck at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;

with so much violence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that through the force thereof, sparcles of fire issued forth of his said Helmet; The which lighting upon some of the Torches that were next set them on a flame; When the Torches were lighted, <hi>Neptune</hi> could not hold, he being also inflam'd like his Torches, with a desire his <hi>Thetis</hi> should see him fight, wherefore he dings again to the Gyant with mighty fierceness, and boldy in the words of Sir <hi>Lancelot</hi> thus bespeaks him,

                     <p>And saying those words, for he feared the multitude that was about him, he sank into the Sea, and letting another most formidable Fart, he blew the Sea up in such a manner, that there was a leagues distance from the bottom of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When he had swallow'd all the said Oxen, he found his stomack indifferent full, which caused in him a desire to rest his bones, which desire caused him to lay himself all along before the said fire; He had not laid there long but he fell into a deep sleep, which being preceived by one of the men that he had swallow'd, by the terrible snoaring that he made, the man not unwilling to miss so nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an oppertunity crept out at his mouth, and seeing him so fast asleep, he went in again, and told his fellows thereof, urging the benefit of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, with such a pithy and well ordered speech, he so wrought upon his Companions, that they grose, and with great secresie drove the Cattel toward his mouth, but coming to his teeth, they found them so close shut, that it was not was not possible to open them without waking the Gyant, wherefore they were fore afflicted: But what will not the invention of man do, when it is in a streight? for seeing themselves stopp'd here, they bethought themselves that the Gyant had another hole through which they hop'd to passe more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely because it was not so near his ears; whereupon they drove the Oxen back again, and searching they found the back passage without any barricado's at all, so that with great content they at length got clear of their p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>NOw you must understand that after the Knight of the <hi>Golden Tulip</hi> was retaken through the great Courage of the Knight of the Bath, he was secured in the Castle of the Lyons, and eke the Knight of the <hi>Mysterious Allegories</hi> was there secured also, so that they had often opportunities to discourse together. Now when they saw each they congratulated one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther right lovingly; Quoth Sr. <hi>Vane</hi> I am right glad to see you Sr. <hi>Lambert,</hi> though not so glad to see you here, however it is better to be here than in the open Fields, where there is no shelter against the Rain, nor any other kind of storm that should happen, for here we have Houses over our heads, so that if it should rain Dogs and Cats we could have no harm. And by the Masse quoth Sr. <hi>Lambert</hi> you speak right cunningly Sr. <hi>Vane</hi>; And besides this we do not fear to have our Corns trod upon by the Horses of the enraged Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioters, nor are we in danger to be bruised by those sturdy Gyants ycleped Carrmen, nor néed we fear to have our Mantles snatch'd from us going late in the dire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <desc>•</desc>

<pb facs="tcp:32507:50"/>
the better of our selves: For experience tells us that have lived long in the World, how that men lock up their choicest Iewels in the most secure places of their Houses; And you see that though at first the Nightingal be moody, yet eftsoones will she sing in her Cage as pleasantly as in the open Air; And I pray what is the Body but the prison of the Soul? and yet our Souls fear nothing more than to be set at liberty. Then said Sr. <hi>Lambert</hi> to Sr. <hi>Vane,</hi> since that we are here met so fortunately together, I entreat you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a small entertainment from me this night, for that I have many things concerning which to confer with you; Most willingly replied Sr. <hi>Vane,</hi> for that your company is right pleasing unto me. When Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was brought in, they commanded their Servants to depart, for that they intended to be very private. Then quoth Sr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Lambert,</hi> most renowned Knight of the <hi>Myst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eriou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> Allegories,</hi> methinks that we being Knights should not be here without our Ladies: though as for mine, I might have the same Opinion of her as <hi>Helion</hi> had of the fair <hi>Constantia,</hi> because of the reported fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity which was betwéen her and the Soldan of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> As for that replied Sr. <hi>Vane,</hi> I will shew thee many examples of Ladies whose fame hath béen blast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which yet before the end of the sting have made a shift to rectifie the mistakes betwéen their Knights and them. But quoth Sr. <hi>Lambert,</hi> suppose that may not be, but that the error be committed, can that be said to concern me any way which was never any pain to me in the World, and of which never any part of my body was sensible. Then replied the Knight of the <hi>Mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Allegories,</hi> Cuckoldry is a very great mystery, and every man understands it not, for true it is, that though you be at <hi>Gran Cairo,</hi> and your Wife be in any part of the Land of <hi>Brittain,</hi> yet at that very moment of time that she admitteth a stranger to copulate with her,
<pb facs="tcp:32507:50"/>
shall the invisible Horn find shelter under the thicket of your Foretop. That quoth Sr. <hi>Lambert</hi> full hardly can I believe, for that you may as well make me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Moon is made of green Cheese. Certes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Sr. <hi>Vane,</hi> you are very ignorant, for the thing by which you seek to prove the impossibility of what I averre, is the greatest Argument of the truth thereof. Why quoth Sr. <hi>Lambert</hi> is the Moon then made of green Cheese? then will I be hang'd. Mark yee, quoth Sr. <hi>Vane</hi> how you confound your self, and how I shall use your own Arguments against you, for if it be not then will I be hang'd. But have you no other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument replied Sr. <hi>Lambert.</hi> Most surely replied Sr. <hi>Vane</hi>; First because I have said it, whose wisdome by which you have so long beed govern'd would receive no small affront, and your self not a little disparage your self, should you not believe me in this thing as well as in other; Then proceeded Sr. <hi>Vane</hi> saying, Know yee then right well Sr. <hi>Lambert,</hi> that in Metaphysicks the Notional difference makes a clear distinction, as falling into an incapacitated sence of the objected Medium. As for example, I say the Moon is made of green Cheese; For green metaphysically distinguished is white, by reason of the objected Medium which is the blew Air; For if you look upon green through a blew Glasse, then it will appear — Hereupon Sr, <hi>Lambert</hi> interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him said unto him, what! thou wilt by and by make me believe the Moon is made of blew Cheese. No re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Sr. <hi>Vane,</hi> for I am no Changling though the Moon be one; I say the Moon is made of green Cheese; For mark ye what I shall say; Behold your Uirgnis af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the green Sicknesse, they are said to look green, when they are in verity white; We call Geese green, yet who is such a Goose as doth not perceive them to be many times grey; Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:32507:51"/>
World that hnows what green Fish is, knows it to be white. And thus the Moon being either red, grey, or white, may properly be said to be green; Now that it is a Cheese, the Allegorical Configuration of the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Ideas doth make manifest; For you see how that a Cheese in its Spherical Rotundity waines and waines till it come to be all eaten, and then presently appears a new Cheese; Even <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o you see it is with the Moon, which when it is at its smallest decrease, that is all eaten up by the Gods, then comes a new Moon. Moreover do you not see holes in a Cheese? and did not the Necromancer <hi>Galileo</hi> discry Holes and Concavities in the Moon. When Sr. <hi>Lambert</hi> heard this, he twisted his Mustachio's with his fore finger and thumb, listning unto the words of Sr. <hi>Vane</hi> like unto a Sow in the Beans: But quoth he, Sr. <hi>Vane,</hi> for all this you tell a strange story, certes I know not how to believe it. When Sr. <hi>Vane</hi> heard that, he waxed wroth, and sware by his Gods, that unlesse he would believe that the Moon was made of green Cheese he would not give his Daughter unto his Son. Sr. <hi>Lambert</hi> was much appall'd thereat, and incontinently alter'd his Opinion, saying that if he would swear it he would believe it.

                     <p>NOw it felt out that Sir <hi>Baxtero</hi> having heard how that Sir <hi>Ludlow</hi> was departed out of <hi>Brittain,</hi> he made great lamentation and moaning; there be that say how he wept even like a young Damosel, who being sent to the Alehouse, looses her mony by the way. O quoth he, is Sir <hi>Ludlow</hi> departed? then what do I make here? Surely it is to no more purpose for me to stay here, than for an Astrologer to live in an Oven; Alas if he do flye the encounter of those Knights that are in pursuit of him, who is as valiant as <hi>Hector,</hi> how is it possible for me to encounter them, who am so much inferiour to him? Now by all the Gods, I am like a man in a Wood, like a man in a Mist, yea in a thick Mist, like a man in a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, yea like a man in a thick Forrest.

Therefore great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune be thou my guide, and direct my stick to fall the right way, for I do intend to go that way my stick falls.

Now was glittering <hi>Phoebus</hi> riding with a swift carear through the midst of Heaven, causing the hand of the Dyal to point to that hour of the day when men in Towns and Cities prepare to satisfy their hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, when the Knight of the Lyons, weary with long tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, laid him down under the shadow of a spreading Oak, nor was it long ere the cares of his mind hung plummets upon his eye-lids, which were clos'd thereby so close to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that you could not thrust the point of a needle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéen them, by which you may guesse that he was fast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sléep.

and the nakednesse of her beauty, without the Prospective Glass of <hi>Tychobrahe.</hi> Now you must know that the Gyant <hi>Thomabedlamus</hi> as he was leaning over a high Oak into the green plast, whereas the distressed Damosel sate, espy'd her in this condition and posture: now wot ye well when he saw her, that he was in a great Agonie, for his goggle eyes roll'd up and down, and the drivil ran down his Beard for joy, for that the Lady was passing beautious; but he did not study to wooe her with Love-verses, neither did he sigh for sorrow, neither did he beat his breast, or make complaints of her disdain, for said he to himself, is not this Forrest mine, and all that is therein? Then who shall give me any distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance? Seeing that there is no Knight so hardy who dares approach these enchanted Shades, I will enjoy this Damosel as many times as there be leaves in this Forrest, for that she pleaseth me wondrous well; Then the Gyant rushed in unto her, and said, Hail fair Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, if thou wilt yield unto me I will do thee no harm; whenas she heheld so great a Gyant, she squéeked right effeminately, and made such a loud Yell, as she had béen a young Grayhound ty'd up in her Kennel. Then the Gyant bespake her, saying, squeek not fair Damosel so loud, for thou squeekest in vain. Alas quoth she, Sir Gyant, it is time for me to squeek, when thou seekest to croppe my Uirgin-flower; Then quoth the Gyant, tell me not of thy Uirgin flower, What signifieth thy flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or thy Uirgin-flower to me? we Gyants never consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them at all. When the Damosel heard him speak so terribly, the blood forsook her pale chéeks, and though her feet were so sore, as we told you before, yet she as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say'd to run away, but the Gyant catching her about the waste, laid his great paw upon her corral lipps, and stopp'd her mouth, beginning to deal with her as men deal with Curtezans at <hi>Venice.</hi> The Damosel finding her mouth stopp'd, made a noise like a Pig that is grasp'd

Ay me, quoth he, hard hearted Girl, now by all the Gods I do curse thee from the bottom of my heart to the bottomless pit of the infernal shades. When the Knight of the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had performed this adventure, he departed toward the Land of <hi>Assyria,</hi> but because he was hard pursu'd by the <hi>Loyal Knight,</hi> he changed his upper garments to Palmers grey, the best means to passe without molesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

prosperity, and sometimes thinking upon the Rapes that he had committed and how he had sorely afflicted several Knights who were thrown into his power by the Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancer <hi>Hugo Petros.</hi> Sometime his guilty mind ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that the bleeding Ghost of the good King of <hi>Britain,</hi> whom he had mudered, followed him up and down, haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him with fearful exclamations, and filling each cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the earth with clamors of revengement. Such fear and terrour raged in his soul, that he thought all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where he travelled, were filled with multitudes of Knights, and that the strength of Countries pursued him, to heap vengeance upon his guilty head for those wrongs that he had wrought, whereby he cursed the hour of his birth, and blamed the cause of his creation, wishing the Fates to consume his body with a flash of fire. In this manner he travelled up and down, filling all places with ecchoes of his grief, which brought him into such, that many times he would have slain himself.</p>
                     <p>But it happened that one morning very early, by the first light of <hi>Titans</hi> burning Torch, he entered into a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and streight passage, which conducted him into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thick and solitary Forrest, wherein he travelled, till such time as glistering <hi>Phoebus</hi> had pass'd the half part of his journey. And being weary with the long way, and the great weight of his Armour, he sate him down, and began anew to have in remembrance his former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted cruelty; and complaining of Fortune, he thus published his grief, for seeing himself without remedy he resolved like the Swan, to sing a while before his death and so thinking to give ease to his tormented heart, he warbled forth these verses following.</p>

Then said the Gyant unto her in the name of all the Gods what make you here? to which she replied, I pray Sr, Gyant what make you here? Oh quoth the Gyant, I am stuft up with sorrow; And I quoth the Lady, am almost stifled with woe.

                     <p>NOw you must understand that in <hi>Londinum</hi> there lived an Arch-Priest who was ycleped <hi>Hugo Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tros</hi>; to him had the Soldan of <hi>Brittain</hi> given large pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, and did oft times discover unto him his bosome thoughts; This made him rich, and his riches made him insolent, he was also greatly lustful, so that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver looked upon any Danisel that was fair but he lusted after her. Now it hapned on a day, that he went to buy Offerings for his Paynim God, the which it was ycle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped <hi>Greedy-Colon,</hi> which he worshipt more than any other God; and as he was buying his said Offering, he chanced to espie the fair <hi>Dolcomona</hi> Wife to Sr. <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now when the Arch-Priest beheld her, he was marvellously ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont'd on her, and greatly desired for to enjoy her; Many opportunities he sought, and many he failed of; Wherefore with a heart full of despair, and much wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for that the Fat thereof was almost dript away, through the heat of those flames that continually tossed

it, he went to the Knight of the Sack-but, who dwelt in a Castle close by, and before the Gate of his Castle there was a Ship which hung in the Air by Magick Art, and when men saw that ship, then they said one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this is the Castle of the Knight of the Sack-but. To him the Arch-Priest disclosed all the secrets of his heart desiring his asistance withall. The Knight of the Sack-but replied right courteously, that he was ready to serve him to the uttermost of his power; Nor do I imagine quoth he, that the fair <hi>Dolcomona</hi> hath a Heart so stony which will not be broken by the Hammer of thy Eloquence. When the Arch-Priest heard him say so, he was much comforted, and determin'd to give her notice of his love in the most passionate lines, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
