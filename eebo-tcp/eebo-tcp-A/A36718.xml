         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Solicited her to conſent,
that he might again convey
her out of his ingroſſing
hands; and She indeed loved the Author of
this Advice with too much Flame to be
backward to comply with him in any thing
that was honeſt and that admitted a plauſible
excuſe: but when She came ſeriouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the Quality and Conſequence of this
Second Rape, She could finde no Praetext
that was Tolerable with which to favour it.
The Reaſons which moved Her to diſallow
his Demands, and with which She endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to ſilence them, were, that She had
no more any cauſe to complain of <hi>Certafilan,</hi>
who treated Her with more ſweetneſs than
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60972:5"/>
She cared for, that She could not forſake
Him without makeing the King and Her
Siſter Her Enemies, without indeed work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ruine of her Honor and Comfort,
and that She hoped they ſhould in time
have Liberty of ſeeing and Entertaining
one another at their Pleaſure, without Her
running away from Him, conſidering that
He kept Her not Company ſo cloſely as He
was wont, and beſides was no longer jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
Nothing could have come more
ſtrange to the Lovers Mind than did theſe
arguings of his Miſtreſs; He took them
not only for a flat Denial of what He had
begged, but alſo for an unqueſtionable
Aſſurance that She no longer Loved Him:
and hurried away with this Opinion, all in a
rage he flung from her without vouchſafeing
her any Reply. This his Indignation
was as wounding to Her, as Her reaſoning
had been offenſive to Him; it ſtruck deep
into her Heart, and moved it from the
bottom. But She conſidered that it Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Her not to be troubled at it, ſo as to be
taken notice off, She therefore made uſe
of all Her forces to undergoe it ſo as became
Her. But what with Her Inquietudes
which grew Riotous, and what with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
which She Exerciſed upon Her ſelf
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60972:5"/>
to ſuppreſs them, She ſo much indammaged
Her Health that She within few houres
went ſick to Bed. Where having lain two
dayes without <hi>Alcidor,</hi> who had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

in it (as indeed looking upon it as
Counterfeit) ſwallowing down the Affront
which She could not chew upon without a

<hi>Page</hi> the charge of the enſuing Letter and
bringing back an Anſwer.</p>

Courteſie, thankt him for his Care of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them in their Affliction, and expreſt
a great contentment to ſee him, which
whither it was as real as it ſeemed great he
could not Judge: Howſoever that which
<hi>Aſtaſia</hi> derived from the ſight of him
was both real and great, it was far more
Evident than that he could make any doubt
of it; She was Extaſied with it and fell in
a Swoon in her Husband's Arms; at which
Accident it was Legibly enough written in
<hi>Alcidor's</hi> Looks that his heart was not in
much better caſe than was that of the Intran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
But the Remedies that were uſed
bringing her to her ſelf again (and together
with her, her Sympathizer alſo) no ſooner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
had She opened her Eyes, but, Sir, ſaid
<hi>Certafilan</hi> to him, our Company doth my
Wifes Health an Injury, let us therefore,
if you pleaſe, leave her for the Preſent
and return to her when She is in a better
Capacity. If I knew my ſelf ſo unhappy,
Replied <hi>Alcidor</hi> to him, as to increaſe the
illneſs of thoſe whom I Viſit, rather than
doe them that Miſchief, I would all my
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60972:7"/>
Life forbid my ſelf the ſight of them, and
ſince you are of the Opinion that my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
brings a Detriment to your Lady, I
leave both her and your ſelf to your Repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
By this his Reply <hi>Certafilan</hi> perceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that what he had ſaid had too ſharply
Prickt him, he endeavoured by Excuſes
and Blandiſhments to heal the hurt that he
had made, but whatſoever Skill he uſed in
the Endeavour he could not hinder him
from going away in Diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>The Lover was indeed from this time,
putting all things into the Ballance together,
ſo Ill ſatisfied with the Husbands humour,
that to give it no more Umbrage he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
not only to go no more to his Houſe,
but alſo to deface out of his Soul all thoſe
Draughts which the Beauty of his Wife
had Ingraved there. In Favour of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
he ſet himſelf on work to ſurvey the
more lovely Faces of <hi>Paquin,</hi> that ſo by
their Variety or by the Prevalency of ſome
one of them he might be brought to forget
that which he had a while adicted himſelf
to, but which now he wholly quitted to its
Uncommunicative Proprietary: and of all,
which in that his Copious Proſpect came
under his Conſideration, he was not long
before he concluded <hi>Carmelia</hi> the moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

of his Vows. That therefore he might
have Liberty of Viſiting her without ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he tyed himſelf in ſo ſtraight a friendſhip
with her Husband <hi>Clidantus</hi> that there was
hardly in all the Court to be ſeen its Parallel.
By which means he and that Fair having a
Frequent Converſe, if his glowing heats
for her ſoon grew to a burning Fever of
Paſſion, She alſo quickly began to languiſh
with a Diſeaſe which made her as much
need him for her Phyſician as he did her
for his.</p>
            <p>Theſe new Loves knocking at <hi>Aſtaſia's</hi>
Eares, She was ſo far from Frowning upon
them, that She with Smiles and from her
heart bad them Welcom. Her Sentiments
were indeed ſince her Sickneſs turned ſo
contrary to what they had before been, that
in the place of Amorous Paſſion She had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
any longer for <hi>Alcidor</hi> but an Amicable
care of his good. When the Forces of
his Merit at any time Aſſaulted her, She
by the Rules and helps of Prudent Vertue ſo
Reſolutely and Dextrouſly defended her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
againſt them that they could gain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upon her more than to make her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
in the Creature the Creators Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.
When She thought of what had
paſt between them, I ſhould be ready to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60972:8"/>
ſuſpect, ſaid ſhe to her ſelf, that <hi>Alcidor</hi>
would throw Dirt upon my Name, but
that I am ſtrongly aſſured that he hath more
both of Wiſdom and Generoſity then to
Defame a Woman who hath by more than
Ordinary Reſpects Obliged him to her. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
what Credit would he get in leading
a Triumph over my Weakneſs and ſetting
up Trophies of an Advantage which my
little reſiſtance enabled him to acquire?
Only Glorious Victories are to be publiſhed
and not ſuch as diſgrace both the Vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Vanquiſher together. Yet let us
Write to him to let him ſee that I, from
my Soul renounce all former Pleaſures, and
that I doe ſo becauſe I preferre my happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
before my Deſtruction. Accordingly
She thus dreſt a Paper and ſent it by <hi>Garinter.</hi>

expreſſion of your Goodneſs that at my
Husbands Intreaty you will Accompany me
to the Place to whicb you have ſo lately
given a Title by the Kind and Noble Rape
which you Acted there: But not finding her
there whom you carried thence every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute

to you. There being no Object in

to her, Judge again and ſay if I ſhall

in your Preſence ſhorter than hours, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſweeter than Moneths ſpent any where

without being thus informed of it, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that you in earneſt wrong <hi>Aſtaſia,</hi>
when you though only in jeſt uſe Courtſhip
to any other Woman. Let us ſpeak no

That ſo Conſpicuous a Starre as <hi>Aſtaſia,</hi>
ſaid <hi>Carmelia</hi> again, ſhould of her own
choiſe leave the clear and eminent Orb of
the Court, where her Siſter alſo moves with
moſt prevailing Splendors and Influences,
and for altogether betake herſelf to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
Station of a Rural Privacy is a ſtory of
much more Rarity and Wonder than that I
ſhould eaſily believe it, did any other but
your ſelf tell me it. I never ſpake any
thing more true, ſaid <hi>Alcidor:</hi> And I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard any thing more ſtrange, ſaid
<hi>Carmelia,</hi> more ſtrange, adjoyned ſhe,
than that the Fair can live content in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from <hi>Alcidor</hi> who is looked upon
as her Heart and Soul. I know not, ſaid
<hi>Alcidor,</hi> what Immaginations thr World
hath either of her or me; but this I can
faithfully aſſure you, our Converſation was
never but very innocent and unblameable,
and I conveighed her not away but with the
King's Approbation. I am not about, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<hi>Carm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lia,</hi> to make an ill Judgment
of her, whom, notwithſtanding that her
Husbands jealouſie hath made more than a
few of the Oppinion that you have had an
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60972:10"/>
abſolute Power over her and governed her
according to your Mind, I have always
believed to be entirely ſage and to have
ſteered her Converſation with an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachable
Diſcretion. <hi>Certafilan</hi> himſelf,
ſaid <hi>Alcidor,</hi> hath by the change of his
Mind, loudly confeſt the injuſtice of thoſe
ſuſpicions which he had of her Vertue, and
their reconciliation makes it ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that it was nothing but his undiſerved
miſtruſtfulneſs and headlong Frenzy which
carried him to treat her ſo ill as he did,
and nothing but his treating her ſo ill that
cauſed her to take that courſe that ſhe did.
And indeed, adjoyned <hi>Carmelia,</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ignorant or over Critical People may
ſay, I am altogether of the Mind that a
Woman is very excuſeable in doing what
may be thought diſreſpectful to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
when he without any apparent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
but out of a Giddy Undiſcerning Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or an Exceptious Peeviſh Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
paſſeth a Contumelious Sentence upon
her honeſty. Not but that I know that the
greateſt part of the Men of this Age are
poſſeſt with the immagination that the more
Fair a Woman is, the leſs Chaſt ſhe is,
as if Nature never formed a Perſon more
than uſually handſom, but to be more than
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60972:11"/>
commonly Vitious. This is, ſaid <hi>Alcidor,</hi>
one of the groſſeſt abuſes that a Mind can
poſſibly be ſeduced with, and I cannot think
that any Man will leave himſelf to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
of it, Who is not ſo much a Fool that
he knows not how to diſtinguiſh between
deſert and default. For what appearance
does it carry of Truth that Organs well
diſpoſed in an Elegant Body ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to act leſs Vigorouſly in what is good
than what is placed in a body of a meaner
Faſhion, eſpecially conſidering that they
whoſe form challengeth a Veneration for
them have far more Advantages and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
to do well than they who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
expoſed to contempt by their outſides
have little care taken of them and can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
little regard to be had, either to their
Perſons or their Actions. Of your Mind
is my Husband, ſaid <hi>Carmelia,</hi> and I have
often heard him ſay that the more beautiful
he ſaw a Woman, the more he eſteemed
her Retained and ſober. I have, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
Madam, reſumed <hi>Alcidor,</hi> for a long
time obſerved it to be true, that there is
ſcarce any evil that rageth with ſo wild a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,
that ſo hardly admits of a remedy,
and that produces ſuch ſad and diſmal effects
as does the poyſon of jealouſie, eſpecially
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60972:11"/>
when drunk in by a Man of Quallity and
Stomach; all Theatres are died with the
Bloud of its Tragoedies, To ſuch a height
of Fury indeed, ſaid <hi>Carmelia,</hi> does this
Malady uſe to carry him whom it poſſeſſes
that rarely he can be cured but either by his
own death or that of the Perſon at whom
he takes offence. But, thanks to my kind
Deſtiny, I have a Husband of whom I have
not the leaſt fear that he ſhould ever be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with this ſo miſcheivouſly fatal
Plague. We ſee much ſtranger things
come to paſs, ſaid <hi>Alcidor,</hi> than that there
ſhould be ſome Vaſſal of your Beauty who
ſhould pay homage to it otherwiſe (though
Vertuouſly too) than <hi>Clidantus</hi> ſhould think
convenient. But ſhould there be ſome ſuch
Man (as what Husband can hinder another
Man from honoring his Wife above all
other Women?) and <hi>Clidantus</hi> ſhould nor
only take it ill, but alſo interdict you his
company, What in that caſe would you
reſolve upon? Not to ſee the Perſon that
might be ſuſpected by him, anſwered <hi>Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
that ſo I might remove from him all
argument of afflicting himſelf and me.
Would you then, ſaid <hi>Alcidor,</hi> commit
ſuch an injuſtice as to ſlight them that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored
you in favour of a diſtruſtful quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60972:12"/>
Husband? I could not be accuſed of
any injuſtice, or of any ſlighting in doing
ſo, replied <hi>Carmelia,</hi> becauſe I did it not
but by conſtraint and out of neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
of my Repoſe, my Reputation
and my Duty. I ſhould indeed reckon that
it behoved me to put in practice all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients
which I could have any hope would
reſtore to a good temper him who was in
ſo ill a one: But if I found them all unavail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and that he would ſtill perſecute me
notwithſtanding all that I could do to oblige
him to the contrary, I would no longer make
any Difficulty of ſeperating my ſelf from
him. So <hi>Aſtaſia,</hi> ſaid <hi>Alcidor,</hi> cannot be
in equity blamed for quitting <hi>Certafilan</hi>
when ſhe ſaw that by nothing that either ſhe
her ſelf or others could either ſay or do he
would be reſtrained from abuſing her, and
if you at any time ſhould do the like, forct
to it as ſhe was, your Vertue will appear
not at all the leſs, ſince reaſonably one
cannot diſlike unfortunates for ſeeking to
affranchize themſelves from their preſſures.
If I have ſpoken any thing to the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of <hi>Aſtaſia,</hi> ſaid <hi>Carmelia,</hi> you have
cauſe to reprehend me for it; but tell me,
I intreat you, what cauſe you have to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
that a wiſe Man as is <hi>Clidantus</hi> and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60972:12"/>
that loves me with all his heart as he does
ſhould ever turn Fool as did <hi>Certafilan,</hi> and
by his unmerciful perſecution of me, ſhould
drive me to tread the ſame path that did
<hi>Aſtaſia.</hi> As I have not Beauty nor other
alectives, ſo no beliefe that any Man can
have ſuch regards for me, as that thence
his fancy ſhould have any thing of ſhaddow
to vex it ſelf about. How in ſaying ſo, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
interrupted her <hi>Alcidor,</hi> do you wrong
heaven together with your ſelf diſowning
the abundant wealth of Graces which its
goodneſs hath beſtowed upon you. But, I
muſt beg leave farther to tell you that as you
are at a great diſtance lovely above others;
ſo you are very far above others beloved,
I am one that love you ſo, and the chains,
which fetter my heart in this Affection are
embodied into it and grown a much dearer
part of it than that I ſhould be willing to part
with them for all the Freedom with which
the World can tempt me. You are come
I ſee, interrupted him <hi>Carmelia</hi> not ſo much
to give me your Company as to make your
ſelf ſport in jeering me. It is ſurely no making
my ſelf ſport, nor jeering of you, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Alcidor,</hi> to ſpeak highly of that which
every body that knows you prizes highly,
and tell you that I adore you as with a moſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60972:13"/>
Profound reverence I do, I am come to wait
upon you in your journey; and withall to gain
an opportunity of declaring to you that my
paſſion, which hath a great while been kept
in by the awe in which I ſtand of you, but
which now breaks its way out by its own
greatneſs and force. If the diſcovery have
any thing criminal in it, inflict upon me what
puniſhment you ſhall think fit, I ſhall make
no appeal from your ſentence, ſo long as I
know that my Torment contents you. Know
then, ſaid <hi>Carmelia,</hi> to what I condemn you;
It is to live with me as you have been wont
without ſpeaking to me of Love or Paſſion,
it being certain that you are either free from
them, or if their ſtroke hath reacht you, it is by
the vertue of <hi>Aſtaſia's</hi> Merrit, not of mine,
which I am conſcious is too weak to take the
meaneſt and moſt facile heart Priſoner, much
leſs is it able to ſubdue yours. To theſe
words <hi>Alcidor</hi> making anſwer, firſt with
moſt Eloquent ſighs and ſilence, then
with moſt earneſt and winning proteſtations,
that his heart was all an entire piece of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
to her and to none but her; ſhe chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her ſtile and told him that becauſe ſhe
would put him to no more trouble ſhe would
endeavour to believe what he had ſaid. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
with this conceſſion, he imprinted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60972:13"/>
a flaming Kiſs upon her hand; which ſhe not
diſcountenancing, he induſtrouſly purſued
his point with other Galantryes, and for his
ſucceſs evidently read it in her looks and
ſilence that ſhe was very well pleaſed with
them, but withall as much aſhamed as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>After ſhe had ſat a while without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a word to him, or ſo much as looking
him in the face, ſeeing Paper with Pen and
Ink upon the Table ſhe took the Pen and
wrote, <hi>I Love,</hi> and then, he looking to
to ſee what ſhe wrote, let drop the Pen, and
fell a ſighing. All which he took notice of;
and better underſtanding the advantage of
the occaſion than to let it ſlip, he intreated
her to ſet down the reſt of her thought: to
which ſhe anſwering that it was without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
that that word came to hand. He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
ſo earneſtly preſt her to proceed, telling
her that ſhe was too judicious to begin to
write, what ſhe had no mind to finiſh, and
that the beginning was too good to remain
imperfect, that ſhe reſumed the Pen and
compleated the Sentence in theſe termes,
<hi>I Love</hi> Alcidor, <hi>if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he be Diſcreet.</hi> Having
this ſhort, but acceptable line, he broke
out into ſtraines of Joy, Thanks and Love,
in which he who was at other times wont to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60972:14"/>
excell others, now Farre excelled himſelf.
To repart to them, the Lady thought her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
concerned to uſe ſuch Language as this,
I confeſs it is not without Reaſon that every
one eſteems you, <hi>Alcidor;</hi> you have power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
means to render your ſelf Maſter of
hearts, it is not now the firſt time that I knew
it, and ſince the Princeſs <hi>Floriſa,</hi> and the
ſweet <hi>Aſtaſia</hi> hath been overcome by, and
been glad to yeild to thoſe your Powers, it
cannot ſurely be ill thought of if I alſo am
ſurprized by them. If what therefore you
have told me is true, all my Life ſhall
witneſs that what I have now written is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
I confeſs, I love you, but I withall
expect that a vertuous retainedneſs ſhould
have the guidance of your carriage towards
me, and if otherwiſe you at any time prove
ſo unſober as to deſire of me, things which
my honor permits me not to give you, aſſure
your ſelf you ſhall carry away nothing of
ill intenſions, but a denial ſtamp with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation;
for I love my Husband, my
Honeſty, and my Reputation better than to
do anything that may prejudice any of them.
Your decree is juſter, Madam, replied <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi>
than that I ſhould in the leaſt go againſt
it; and I am more effectually yours, than
to ceaſe to be ſo by enterpriſes diſagreeable
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60972:14"/>
to you. Having ſtopt a little at thoſe words,
I acknowledge, Madam, went he on, that
you may with equity defend me from aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to thoſe Bli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſes, which you have in
your power to beſtow, but which are too
great for the greateſt, and of which they
who have moſt worth are unworthy: yet
let your charity allow, as it unblameably
may, that upon this beautiful Mouth of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and this fair Boſom of Lillies (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with theſe words he kiſt them both)
I proteſt before Love himſelf, that I will
hence forward have no other will but yours.
This on-ſet of Love, gracefully conducted
as it was, <hi>Carmelia</hi> not having the Power
to take it ill, That I may not ſhew my ſelf
ſo ſevere, ſaid ſhe, in ſome confuſion of
affection and modeſty, as to deny you what
I may honeſtly grant you, I permit you this
familiarity of Kiſſes, provided they be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and free from impurity; but this is the
greateſt perſonal kindneſs that you are to
expect from me, and that great enough to
let you clearly ſee, I love you to a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
The priviledge, Madam, returned
<hi>Alcidor,</hi> is of a much Nobler value, than
that in the frution of it I ſhould not own my
ſelf a moſt wealthy Man of happyneſs. More
he was going to ſay, but <hi>Felisbea</hi> coming
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60972:15"/>
into the Chamber interrupted their converſe,
and they had at that time no more opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of diſcourſeing of any thing, but the
journey which they were about to make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
They nevertheleſs expreſt their
hearts to one another by ſigns as Emphatical
as words, and having broken their Faſts,
and taken the Road, they there alſo, though
that Siſter of <hi>Clidantus</hi> not a little obſtructed
their deerneſſes, frequently tranſmitted them
by ſtealth to one another, without being at
all perceived by her.</p>
            <p>Having nothing by the way that moleſted
them and <hi>Alcidor</hi> all along holding diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
with which a very bad humour would
have been diverted, they got happily to
their Journey's end, and therefore alſo the
more happily becauſe their arrival gave a
very ſenſible mitigation to the illneſs of
<hi>Clidantus;</hi> he ſhewed himſelf more revived
by the ſight of them, and particularly of
<hi>Alcidor,</hi> than it could be imagined his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
was capable of; and during eight
dayes after their comming he carried it out
well: But he was ſo ſick the ninth that his
Phyſicians began to deſpiar of his recovery,
and he afterwards for many dayes laboured
under pains which rendred his life a burthen
to him, and which though <hi>Carmelia</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60972:15"/>
loved <hi>Alcidor</hi> infected her with ſo
much trouble that not he whom ſhe loved ſo
much, could with all his conſolatory endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
put aſtop to her tears. In this his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<hi>Felisbea</hi> took a juſt and a kind Siſter's
part but not ſo much as that uncommon ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
which ſhe had alwayes for him
would have prompted her to have taken, had
her mind been at liberty; but it was called
off from ſympathizing with <hi>Clidantus</hi>
by being continually taken up in admireing
<hi>Alcidor.</hi> After ſhe had admired him a while
ſhe grew big with Love of him, and then
reſtleſly ſolicitous that he ſhould have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
reſpects for her. So much he ſaw
by (beſides other deports) the ſighs and
languiſhing regards which upon all his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſhe ſent after him. But his inclinations
carrying his heart with too rappid a current
to <hi>Carmelia,</hi> to ſuffer him to think of <hi>Felisbea</hi>
as ſhe deſired, he deſſembled his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of what he ſaw, and whatever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
ſhe uſed (as ſhe uſed ſeveral) to
make him know her mind, and conform to
it, he carried himſelf as if he was wholly
ignorant of their meaning. This added
very much to her anxiety and he who
was the occaſion of it, was enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that he was ſo, but made ſhew
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60972:16"/>
of believeing that it was all upon the account
of her Brother. When therefore ſhe had
ſufficiently wearied her ſelf with ſighing for
him, who would not rightly intereſt himſelf
in it, She perſwaded her ſelf that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
without any thing of diſguiſe, to lay
her heart open before him, and ſhe had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
made her own mouth her agent, and
Interpreter of it to him, had not that great
portion which ſhe had of honor and Sageneſs
reſtrained her from it. It was not with a
wanton Eye that ſhe looked upon him, the
mark at which ſhe aimed was Marriage,
that which he never yet ſhot at, and full of
Vertue as ſhe was, ſhe would rather have
hugged death than have harbored a thought
unworthy of it. But yet withall her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
of haveing him for her Husband, had
too much Fire in them, to be kept from vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Screwed up by their urgencies, to a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
far above her temper, ſhe took the
firſt opportunity of being with him, and as
ſhe was going from him, without his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieveing
her, let drop at his feet a Paper,
which, his Eye quickly lighting upon it and
his curioſity prompting him to take it up and
peruſe it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he found to have theſe breif con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60972:16"/>
Alcidor's, <hi>qualities are all raviſhing
and unleſs one be Marble, one cannot conſider
him without being wounded for him. If he
is not ſenſible of this, he is not accquainted
with himſelf; his only fault is that he hath an
averſion to Marriage which the affections of
others and his own Merit and Interests demand
of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was at no pains to know whoſe this
note was, he was too well accquainted with
the mind and hand of <hi>Felisbea</hi> not to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that it was hers. He was therefore not
a little perplext how he ſhould carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
towards her, but at length he reſolved
to coverſe with her as formerly without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any notice to her of the writing, but
ſhunning all occaſions that might bring him
into a particular engagement with her. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this mind to her Brothers Chamber
where he knew ſhe was, he was no ſooner
in her Eye, but ſhe was all dyed with bluſhes
and loſt in ſhame. Obſerving which Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he made no ſhew that he obſerved it,
but, after he had askt <hi>Clindatus</hi> how he
did, entred into a diſcourſe with him and
his Lady. She having by that means leiſure
of recollecting herſelf, after a few minutes
came and ſat upon the Bed-ſide by him, liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to his words as to harmonious Oracles,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60972:17"/>
and conſidering his perſon and faſhion as
ſomething more than humane. They had
not ſat above a quarter of an hour, but there
entred viſiters to the ſick Man; to let whom
come up to him, <hi>Alcidor</hi> and <hi>Felisbea</hi> drew
back and fell into a converſation by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
At the inſtant the clouds of <hi>Felisbea</hi>'s
homor diſperſed, and ſhe grew more gay
than uſually, encouraged by an expectation
that <hi>Alcidor</hi> would entertain her about her
Paper. But this was far from his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and he only entertained himſelf with
her about her Brother and the company that
was come in; in which terms they were
when <hi>Clidantus</hi> called him to him, to take
part in a diſcourſe of rallery which a Lady
of very good Ingenij had begun with deſign
of diverting him.</p>
            <p>Divided from <hi>Alcidor</hi> and diſappointed
of her hopes <hi>Felisbea</hi> withdrew in diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to her Chamber, where having wept a
floud ſhe broke out into ſuch Language as
this. No, No, <hi>Felisbea,</hi> it is in vain that
thou ſtriveſt to captivate this heard-hearted
inſenſible Man. Canſt thou any longer queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that he ſlights thee? Comeſt thou not
from having too experimentall a proof of
it? If he made never ſo little reckoning of
thee, would he treat thee with ſo much
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60972:17"/>
cold indifferency? If thy Note which thou
ſaweſt him take up had pleaſed him, would
he have been kept from ſpeaking of it to
thee? would he have made ſhew of knowing
nothing of it? He took it and read it, but
not liking what he read, he would feign him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ignorant of what he too well knows. It
is a folly for thee think to make him thine;
he is too much <hi>Astaſia</hi>'s, and her attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
hold too abſolute a Monarchy over him
to let him be any other Womans.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Felisbea</hi> was in ſuch terms with
herſelf <hi>Clorangius</hi> entred her Chamber with
the Meſſage that he came to fetch her to her
Mother who it was feared, was dying, a
Meſſage which made the tears trickle down
her cheeks afreſh, but that as much for ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
that ſhe muſt leave <hi>Alcidor,</hi> as, though
ſhe loved <hi>Dolinda</hi> as ſhe was in duty bound,
out of a ſence that ſhe was in danger of
looſing her. <hi>Alcidor</hi> was indeed grown an
inſeparable requiſite to her ſatisfaction; ſhe
therefore deferred her journey as long as ſhe
could, but at laſt with wet eyes and troubled
heart bad adieu to him, <hi>Clidantus</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ſhe was extreamly diſcontented at her
going away; <hi>Alcidor</hi> was as glad of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that as long as ſhe had ſtayed he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60972:18"/>
could never have come near <hi>Carmelia</hi> without
finding her with her, and the ſame day that
ſhe went taking the advantage of her abſence
he and <hi>Carmelia,</hi> while <hi>Clidantus</hi> ſlept walkt
into a little wood, private and thick which
joyned to the Garden of their Houſe: Here
haveing ſeated themſelves as conveniently
as they could upon the Moſſy root of a well
ſpread Oak, and haveing no more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
witneſſes to fear than the Birds and
trees, they entred into a mutually endearing
converſation, and proceeded from one
kindneſs to another, untill they ſeemed at
ſtrife which of them ſhould ſhew moſt, and
till <hi>Alcidor</hi> began to argue with himſelf from
<hi>Carmelia's</hi> freeneſs that ſhe had ſo warm a
Paſſion for him, that if he would but take
the confidence to try, ſhe might be brought
to grant him what in colder modeſty ſhe
had forbidden him to aſpire to. While ſuch
thoughts paſt up and down in his mind, ſhe
who ſuſpected nothing of them, but was
willing to indulge as much to his and her
own affections as ſhe thought, ſhe well
might, without infringing her duty to <hi>Clidan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
and the rules of decency, curled his locks
and kiſt his forehead with little leſs allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than if ſhe had a mind to dreſs a party
againſt her Chaſtity. Confirmed by theſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60972:18"/>
her more innocently intended dalliances in
the opinion that if ſhe was importuned ſhe
would not refuſe him that which places a

to make uſe of that conveniency of the place
for the performance of what he had a mind
to, he had his flames ſo animated that think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no longer of any thing but quenching
them (with thoſe delights which have the
Vertue both of quenching and re-accending
the thirſt of Love) he ſolicited her to what
was ſo diſagreeable to her, that ſtarting up
from the place where ſhe was ſet and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as pale as if ſhe had recieved ſome blow
that made her heart fail, How, <hi>Alcidor,</hi> ſaid
ſhe to him, dare you entertain me with ſo
foul a baſeneſs, a baſeneſs which unſpeakably
aſtoniſhes and offends me together? Think
you that to gratifie your brutiſhneſs I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
my honeſty? Go make your prayers to
luſtful women; it is at their temples that you
muſt addreſs your offerings. With theſe
words fetching a deep ſigh and on a ſudden
growing as red as ſhe was before pale, ſhe
haſtily turned to go away: but <hi>Alcidor</hi> who
read his delinquency in her face and carriage
and expreſt his penitential diſtraction in his
<pb n="03" facs="tcp:60972:19"/>
ovvn, held her by the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntle and throwing
himſelf at her feet, I acknowledg, Madam,
ſaid he to her, that the cholar that you are in
is no greater than is juſt and reaſonable: but
if there be any thing in the univerſe that
hath influence upon your ſpirit, I by it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you to pardon the untuly violence of
the paſſion which I have for you; It is that
which having deprived me of my reaſon
haith been the cauſe of my impudence; and
if nothing elſe will ſatisfie you, I have not
a drop of bloud with which I am not ready
to expiate it. No, No, interrupted ſhe him,
I have no body to blame but my ſelf who
have too lightly and fooliſhly permitted you
familiarities which have made you hope as
eaſily to obtain the ſpoyls of my Chaſtity.
But undeceive your ſelf, <hi>Alcidor,</hi> and know
that I ſhould much more cheerfully love to
dye than conſent (as you immagine I might
be induced to do) to the ruine of my honor.
I am ſenſible, Madam, replied <hi>Alcidor,</hi> that
my crime, though it have love for its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice,
is of a very deep and ugly ſtain, but
any repentance, if any repentance can be ſo,
is anſwerable to it. I again therfore beg by
all that you hold good and dear to pardon
me, and I beg you not to do it, but upon
condition, that if ever I fall back into the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60972:19"/>
ſame ſin, you baniſh me for ever from your
favour without leaving me the leaſt hope of
Mercy. Overcome with theſe words and
other teſtimonies of remorſe which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
in a plain and large Character, ſince I
have reaſon to believe, returned ſhe to him,
that you are really troubled for the offence
that you have given me, forbear trobling your
ſelf any farther, I fully pardon you, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
I lay an indiſpenſable charge upon you,
that you no more go againſt the law which
I have by the Obligation of Vertue neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
preſcribed you. I confeſs I love you
entirely, but if you imagine you ſhall be
ever able to draw from me more than what I
have told you I will allow you; know I ſhall
run to my grave rather than bring a blot upon
the integrity of my life. As for our wonted
Careſſes Provided you proceed not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
propoſitions I will allow you them as
heretofore, but if by allowing you them you
again encourage your ſelf to abuſe me, aſſure
your ſelf you will oblige me to hate you as
much as I love you. I farther eſteem my
ſelf very happy in being at preſent alone with
you, but leaſt any ill ſhould be ſuſpected of
us, let us return to <hi>Clidantus,</hi> who poſſibly
may awake and ſend about in ſearch of us
if he finds us not by him. To this he having
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60972:20"/>
replied with very ingenious acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of her goodneſs they ſealed their
reconciliation with ſome warm kiſſes, and
paſt next way out of the wood to <hi>Clidantus</hi>
his Chamber, where when they firſt came
in they found him aſleep, but he preſently
awakened and ſignified himſelf very well
pleaſed to ſee them about him.</p>
            <p>It being a Month after this before his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
could with their beſt diligence ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
his Recovery to any conſiderable paſs
they in that time enjoy'd all the contentments
with one another that in the tye which limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them and in the place where they were
they could ſoberly expect, and in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of them <hi>Carmelia's</hi> affection grew
to ſuch a height that ſhe began to ſee by its
effects that to love her lover more, ſhe loved
her Husband leſs. This enormity ſhe made
very aſſiduous effects to overcome, but as
often as ſhe made them, ſhe ſo often expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
that the more ſhe reſiſted, the more
the forces which ſhe had to fight againſt,
increaſed, and deſires continually ſprung up in
her mind which were altogether contrary to
her will and which made her wholly aſhamed
of her ſelf, but which her reaſon ſeting it
ſelf to oppoſe there was alwayes ſomething
which obtained the victory againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:60972:20"/>
While ſhe was in this rout, which, though
ſhe could not rectifie, ſhe very diſcreetly
concealed: her Husband by the advice of his
Phyſicians reſolved to return to <hi>Laqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>;</hi> that
which <hi>Alcidor</hi> liked very well both becauſe
he loved the abode of the Court, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he made no queſtion of having more
liberty with <hi>Carmelia</hi> there than where they
now were, and that which was now by his
fartherance of it quickly put in execution.</p>
            <p>The next day after they were come to the
Royal City. <hi>Alcidor</hi> going, under colour
of viſiting <hi>Clidantus,</hi> to ſee <hi>Carmelia,</hi> found
<hi>Felisbea</hi> with them, whom he ſaluting with
civility enough, and a kiſs which had more
of manners than heat in it, but which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſo much diſſolved and drew out her
heart that ſhe could hardly defend her ſelf
from falling in a ſwoon, the ſame deſires
repullulated in her ſoul which had not long
ſince agitated it, and her humour withall
ſhewed it ſelf dreſt in lighter colours than
it had for a long time been ſeen in. Of
which latter <hi>Carmelia</hi> taking notice, but not
underſtanding the ground, thought it ſprung
from the pleaſure which ſhe received in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Brother recovered together with her
Mother. <hi>Alcidor</hi> knew better how to judge
of it, but thought not ſit to alter the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60972:21"/>
of the one by diſcovering the affection
of the other. But in whatſoever cheerful
temper ſhe was at firſt after their return, and
with whatſoever illneſs ſhe was afterwards
ſtruck, four dayes after ſhe took her Bed,
and eight dayes after ſhe was laid in her
Grave.</p>
            <p>She was a Siſter whom <hi>Clidantus</hi> loved as
himſelf: the ſeparation therefore workt ſo
ſharply upon him that it renewed his old ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the ralapſe had ſo ill a look that
it made his Phyſicians look for nothing good
to come of it. They telling his Lady their
thoughts, ſhe called up all her conſtancy to
expect and bear with patience the feared
event; and ſhe had withall <hi>Alcidors</hi> adviſes
and comforts to aſſiſt her in that occaſion:
but they were neither of them ſo effectual,
but after ſome days a humor ſpreading it
ſelf through the ſick mans Body which took
away the uſe of his Limbs, her grief want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but little of proveing as mortal to her as
his Palſey was likely to do to him. But her
former Phyſician taking in hand the cure of
it, it by little and little decreas'd, that which
was the cauſe of it at the ſame time grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every day worſe than other.</p>
            <p>Six <hi>Moons</hi> having filled and emptied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs,
and all the arts that were uſed and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60972:21"/>
pains that were taken with <hi>Clidantus</hi> (and all
were uſed and taken that could be thought
expedient) ſerving only to prove that his
Diſeaſe was incurable, <hi>Alcidor,</hi> who had
for the moſt part of that time been employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the King in expeditions of War,
finding him in this condition at his return
reſolved to draw all the advantage out of it
that he could, and, as his paſſion for <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melia</hi>
flamed higher than ever, to make more
preſſing declarations of it to her than ever,
ſerving himſelf therefore of the opportunity,
he entertained her with regrets for the illneſs
of <hi>Clidantus,</hi> with laments for her afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and with complaints of his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs,
which brought thick clouds over
her eyes and preſently a large ſhower out
of them. That done he turned to his ſtile
to Gallantries and the Amaeneſt Themes;
he painted his fires to her with moſt lively
and withall moſt Venuſt draughts, he with
the moſt moving Rhetorick that he could
weave repreſented to her how unreaſonable
it was that her florid youth and Beauty
ſhould be intombed in Melancholy, and what
vivid, generous and elevated contentments
thoſe Lovers have who in tirely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reſerve addict themſelves to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and his ſucceſs was that the air of her
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60972:22"/>
looks and deportment changed from gloomy
to ſerene, that from the picture which he
made her of his fires ſhe not only fancied
that ſhe ſaw them and felt them burn, but
alſo really contracted ſympathetick heats,
more moveing than ſhe ever before had felt,
and that ſhe let him ſee as much, as alſo
that ſhe approved of what he ſaid, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
with him more liberally than ever,
and careſſing him more profuſely. Perceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how he gained ground of her he ſtopt
not there but followed her cloſe with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
Blandiſhments, Arguments, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
and by their importunate and inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
faſcinations wound himſelf at length,
as into the chief room of her heart, ſo into
that place in her Arms, which <hi>Clidantus</hi> only
was wont to hold, but was now no longer
capable of holding. Not but that ſhe ſtill
retained for that bed-rid Man thoſe offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
reſpects which were due to him from
his Wife and with a tender compaſſion pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
edeavoured his eaſe and releif. It was
the ſame compaſſion, though ſhe might have
ſome thoughts that of <hi>Clidantns</hi> his Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
ſhe ſhould become <hi>Alcidor's</hi> Wife,
which compelled her ſometimes to joyn
with him in the Prayers which he made,
that ſince he could expect no other remedy
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60972:22"/>
death would be his Phyſician and releaſe
him. his life was indeed drawn out with ſo
much torment that it was a true kindneſs to
him to wiſh the thred of it cut of, and that
<hi>Dolinda</hi> her ſelf who had brought him into
the VVorld continually deſired to ſee him
go out of it. He having continued ſix months
longer in this ſad condition the wiſhes of
himſelf and his Friends were granted, his
Soul taking wing and leaving his Body to be
laid to bed in the Earth, that which his
Lady took care to have done with a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
which purchaced her a great Name,
and with tears which were her witneſſes
that though ſhe had ſometimes in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his miſery wiſht him in his Grave, ſhe
would have been very ready to have fetcht
him out of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clidantus</hi> gone, <hi>Alcidor</hi> and <hi>Carmelia</hi> lived

would have been good reaſon to have
admired the ſweetneſs, if there had not

innocence. The intimacy of it bringing
the Ladie's vertue into ſuſpition, the
Ladies who were wont to frequent her
company, by little and little forbore viſiting
her. Not able to overlook which diſreſpect,
or to queſtion the ground upon which they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60972:23"/>
built it, ſhe took occaſion to ſpeak of it to
<hi>Alcidor,</hi> that ſo ſhe might clear her conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and engage him to remove her diſrepute
by the Marriage which ſhe daily expected
from him: And he fed her expectation with
promiſes fitted to her palate, but withal,
having no mind to come under the yoke,
which ſhe would have put upon him, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to diſengage himſelf from her as
ſoon as handſomly he could. To effect what
he had determined, he concluded with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to go paſs ſome Moneths in one of his
country Houſes, but to her he pretended
that the King had commanded him upon his
ſervice into a remote Province, that which
ſhe eaſily believed, in regard of the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page
which ſhe ſaw him provide for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
and he withall perſwaded her to
retire from the Court and live privately in
the Country during his abſence, that which
ſhe readily conſented to. All things being
prepared for the ſeparation and the day
come, he ſaw the grief with which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
it flow with ſo large a ſtream in her
Eyes, and he had in his own breaſt ſuch a
reluctancy to it that he was upon the point
of deſiſting from his purpoſe, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
not to leave her: But conſidering
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60972:23"/>
that if he ſtayed with her any longer he muſt
either unworthily abuſe or elſe Marry her,
from both which he had many reaſons that
diſſwaded him, he enforced himſelf to go
on with what he had undertaken, and what
he ſaw neceſſary, though harſh. After there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had both ſighed enough, they bad
the Court and one another farewel, he take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his way, and ſhe hers.</p>
            <p>Come into his Province, <hi>Alcidor</hi> by the
Proofs which he gave of his qualities made
all other the brighteſt Perſonages appear to
him but as glimmering Stars to the Sun in
blaze, and like a Miracle drew all eyes and
affections after him. But he who made all
that ſaw him in love with him, could not
keep himſelf from being in love with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
He ſaw ſhine a beauty, which (when
he had examined Eyes, Face, Shape, Aire,
Port, all) he could wiſh nothing either ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to or taken from, and which, as the Sun
puts out all leſſer lights and fires, extinguiſht
in his mind the glories not only of <hi>Floriſa</hi>
and <hi>Astaſia</hi> but of <hi>Carmelia</hi> alſo, and brought
in the incomparable <hi>Dorame</hi> to rule there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
This young Widow who was iſſued
of one of the beſt Houſes of <hi>China</hi> appeared
to him to have ſo much of divine in her, that
he without any ſcruple ſacrificed to her his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60972:24"/>
whole heart, and that with a different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
from what he had formerly paid at
Femal ſhrines. It ſeemed altogether unjuſt
to him not to love her with a pure integrity
and for all his life, or in loveing her not to
build upon Vertue, not to aim at Marriage,
not to breath after better things than Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
ſenſual enjoyment. Become thus in a
Moment of a Volatile Libertine a conſtant
and faithful ſubject of Love, before he made
any diſcovery of his intentions he examined
his own Birth, Actions and Fortunes, to ſee
if theſe were advantages weighty enough to
allow him hopes of gaining ſuch a poſſeſſion
as was that which he had in his wiſhes, and
when indeed he well conſidered what he
was, it was impoſſible that the luſtre of his
own worth, ſhould caſt his rayes about him
without lighting him to ſee that he ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
merited what he had a mind to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>Celebriouſly accompliſht as <hi>Dorame</hi> was,
would ſhe from the time that her dear <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidas</hi>
expired have entertained propoſals of
a ſecond Husband, ſhe might have had the
ſame day of his Funerals, to have been that

but there was no body whom he feared but
her whom he loved, and nothing that he cared
for but to make her love him. But before
that he by any ſuites or declarations to her
delivered his mind of that with which it was
big, he thought it beſt often to viſit her,
and every time that he viſited her, as he
found in her Wit, Humour, Faſhion, Form,
ſome new occaſion of admiring her and of
coveting her with impatience for his Wife,
ſo the generouſneſs and ſweetneſs of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
the equability and moderation of
his temper, the Elegancy and ſublimeneſs of
his Ingenij, the gracefulneſs of his Perſon
and carriage, and the great Civility or rather
Devotion of his reſpectfulneſs to her, more
and more nouriſht and augmented that kind
eſteem which from her firſt knowledge of
him ſhe had conceived for him, ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was long, if ſhe had at any time any
thoughts of being re-married, it was only
to <hi>Alcidor,</hi> that which would have made
him account himſelf a moſt happy Man had
he been acquainted with it, but ſhe very
watchfully concealed it from him.</p>
            <p>From theſe ſame frequent viſits that he
made to her and other obſervables of his
actings, though he had told his own ſoul
only the zeal which he had of applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60972:25"/>
to her a ſervant of love, people gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
argued a probabilty of it, his competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
in particular conceived ſo ſtrong an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of it, that they all ſuperſeded from
waiting upon her, ſome affraid of meaſuring
Swords with him, others knowing that they
could not meaſure Deſerts with him. He
would have been better contented that ſome
of the moſt gallant of them ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
firm in their purſuite, that ſo they
diſputeing the prize with him, his Victory
(or fall) might have been the more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
But ſeeing them all forſake the liſts
of her ſervice he one day took occaſion to
ſpeak of it to her.</p>
            <p>He having upon which ſubject ſaid what
he thought convenient, It is my ill fortune
returned ſhe to him, which will have them
in the Series of my Converſation obſerve my
want of Merit, and then withdraw that they
may looſe no more time in remarking in me
defects which oblige them to fly from me
inſtead of following me. And you, Sir,
added ſhe, after you have known me a
while will Judge it neceſſary to do the like.
What wayes one may invent, cryed <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi>
interrupting her, to reproach the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
excellencies under Heaven! The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
why they quit you, Madam, continued
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60972:25"/>
he with a low reſpect, is becauſe they are
ſenſible that the zeal with which I adore you
is abundantly ſtronger, purer and more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
than theirs, and therefore, though it hath
no Merit in it ſelf, yet, in compariſon with
theirs, deſerves to be better received and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compens'd:
And imagine not, for you will
be unjuſt if you do ſo, that I have ſo diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd
a ſpirit as ever to imitate thoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagants
who meet their ſhame in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe comming a little unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
but very acceptably to her from him for
whom ſhe had more affection than ever ſhe
had for any, her beloved <hi>Clicidas</hi> excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
In earneſt, Sir, replied ſhe preſently,
you have a very ingenious art, and you are
very induſtrious in uſing it to make your ſelf
ſport with thoſe abſents and with me; and
you would perſwade me into a ſtrange be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
ſhould I give up my ſelf to hearken to
you: but as little diſcretion as I have, I
have ſo much as to underſtand your flatteries
and to know what ear and credit I am to
give them. If <hi>Alcidor</hi> loves, it is not <hi>Dora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me</hi>
that he loves, he aſpires to things more
exalted, and Princeſſes, not ſuch as I, are
the objects of his Vows. I wiſh no more,
Madam, replied <hi>Alcidor</hi> to her, than that my
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60972:26"/>
ſatisfaction depended upon the truth of this,
that I think there is nothing humane to
which I can aſpire more exalted than your
ſelf; and that is my next Religion under
what I ow to Heaven to vow and pay to
you all that Man can Vow and pay to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
For Heaven knows that, though I
have ſtayed till now to tell you ſo, from the
firſt minute that I ſaw you, my breaſt hath
been nothing elſe but a region of fires which
your beauties kindled, and which burn to
you with as fervent and clear a devotion as
ever did thoſe upon the <hi>Perſian</hi> Altars to the
bright Eye of the World. It is too probable
that you account it criminal in me to be a
Candidate of thoſe Felicities which <hi>Cliſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
while he lived enjoyed; but make what
judgment of me and diſpoſal you think good,
I ſhall never the more ceaſe to pay homage
to you and nevertheleſs endeavour to make
good the quality of your ſervant.</p>
            <p>Having many arguments to believe that
theſe words had nothing of cozening paint
or artifice in them but were the genuine
dictates of his heart wholly given up to her,
<hi>Dorame</hi> ſtood ſtill a while pleaſing her ſelf
with the acquiſition that ſhe had made, Then
if it be true, Sir, returned ſhe that you
have that kindneſs for me that you pretend,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60972:26"/>
it it alſo true that I reap a moſt plentiful ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and advantage by it, and that I ſhould be
both very ungratful and very unwiſe together
ſhould I deny it an agreeable reception: and
you have for my encouragement the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and the eſtimation of a more generous
Man, than to deſign the abuſing a Widow
who reckons nothing more recommendable
than your vertue or more worthy of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
than your accompliſhments, and who
therefore accounts it a moſt weighty ſubject
of glory to her to ſee you ſtoop to conſider
her otherwiſe than ſhe can by any title of her
own challenge. You are highly injurious to
your ſelf, Madam, replyed he, in diſclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the pretenſions which by the graces of
which you are owner you may moſt right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
make: As you in complement name
me uncapable of a Scepter, I ſeriouſly and
with good reaſon eſteem you worthy of a
Crown. I ſee I can gain nothing upon you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
ſhe, your tongue, nor to contradict
that great opinion that every one hath of
you, delighting to ſhew its Pomp in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
me more victoriouſly, that which
you would have me believe. There needs
no art of words, returned <hi>Alcidor,</hi> to declare
a truth ſo plain as is that of your overtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
worth, its rayes will break through
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60972:27"/>
the thickeſt veil. I am ſenſible indeed that
the more perfection you have and know you
have, the leſs hope I can have that you ſhould
give to one ſo defective as I am, that place
in your heart that I dye for; but yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
chuſe but ſay that if you will conſult the
World about your qualities, I am willing
you ſhould name me Impoſtor, and treat
me as ſuch a one if all that know you do not
avow you one of the chiefeſt of thoſe pieces
which are matter of Admiration to them.
I very well know, anſwered <hi>Dorame,</hi> that
only to hear you ſpeak is enough to take
away from the eyes and ſpirit of thoſe that
hear you, the faculty of judging things as
they appear: I will therefore conteſt no
longer with you, as being certain of the
conqueſt which you have a mind to win. I
yield you that which you at preſent contend
for; let us now diſcourſe of ſomething elſe.
What can I diſcourſe of to you, reparted
<hi>Alcidor,</hi> ſo much to my mind as of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
which you have in your ſelf, and of
the affections which I have for you? But to
obey you I will at preſent ſay no more of
either of them, provided that you will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
me to believe what I have already ſaid
of both. To give you a ſatisfaction, ſaid
<hi>Dorame</hi> to him, I agree to what you ask, ſo
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60972:27"/>
far as my Conſcience of my ſelf will allow
me, and I ſhall doubt leſs of your love than
of my own merit, ſince you have ſo great
a deſire to aſſure me of the former, and I
have ſo little reaſon to aſſure my ſelf of the
latter. I ſhall indeed be very much at eaſe,
Madam, reſumed <hi>Alcidor,</hi> if you will rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
my Paſſion as true, ſerious and great, as
it really is, and as I have a deſire to give you
teſtimonies that it is; but it will be with hopes
that you will retaliate it to me, which if I miſs
of my eaſe will prove as little as is that of the
wounded Man who knows that the Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
upon whom his recovery depends is
ſufficiently acquainted with his wounds, but
will not take in hand the Cure of them.</p>
            <p>At this Language <hi>Dorame</hi> caſting down
her looks and forbearing to anſwer, <hi>Alcidor</hi>
threw himſelf upon his knees before her in
the faſhion of a Homager, if not a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper.
She ſtooping to raiſe him up, her
cheek came ſo near his mouth that tempted
with the opportunity he could not forbear
touching it with his lips, which (perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as it was with a graceful delicacy) ſhe
not ſhewing her ſelf diſpleaſed with, accend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the favour, and willing from that
ſtep to derive pretence to another, he roſe
and with a new confidence but alſo with a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60972:28"/>
reverence not much different from that of
Religion made ſome cloſer impreſſions of his
lips upon her mouth and eyes, not indeed
without being reproved by her for it, but
that with a ſweet and ſoft mildneſs which
ſhewed ſhe could not be much offended with
that which was only to be attributed to the
exceſs of his love, and which encouraged
him to doe the like, again rather than deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him from it.</p>
            <p>He having after a few days by the endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
engageing powers of his Merit and
courtſhip prevailed with her plainly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of his ſervice, their converſation had
ſo much vertuous amoenity and ſweetneſs
in it, that it was a great deal of pitty it ſhould
have been interrupted; but he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to go to accord a quarrel of which
he was made Arbiter, and the law of his
charity did them the ill office of ſeparating
them, that which they would have account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
yet a worſe office, had they not conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that the Adverſaries whom he went to
reconcile deſerved that he ſhould take that
pains for them.</p>
            <p>Two days after his departure ſhe was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
in her Chamber by <hi>Rolimon, Melian</hi>
and <hi>Vindorix,</hi> where this Uncle and Cozens
had not ſtayed long before they told her that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60972:28"/>
they had not at preſent made a Journey to
her but to ſolicit her to receave for her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
her old Lover <hi>Cartagenes,</hi> whoſe worth
and quallity were no more uuknown to her
than were his Love and and ſervices. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to which ſhe who had taken the retreat
of that Cavaleir as well as of her other ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
for a ſign, either of a frigid affection or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
a faulty courage, they having never viſited
her ſince <hi>Alcidor</hi> frequented her, freely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
the ill opinion which ſhe had conci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of him as well as of the reſt. <hi>Rolimon</hi>
did his endeavour to remove from her this
impreſſion, ſpeaking all that he could to the
advantage of his friend; but he after all
found that it was but labor in vain to go
about to replace him in her favour. He
ceaſing therefore to alledge any thing more
in his behalf, ſhe changed her action and
language, and ſuccinctly told them all that
had paſt between her and <hi>Alcidor,</hi> ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely
repreſenting to them the Love which
he had propounded to her, that they reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a high delight in hearing it, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
connſelled her to think of no other Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
<hi>Alcidor,</hi> ſaid <hi>Rolimon,</hi> beſides that
he is of an illuſtrious Bloud, is Maſter of
Quallities, altogether uncommon to the
World, his Courage maks him feared, his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60972:29"/>
Courteſie loved, every thing of him admired,
he hath gained a reputation of a large extent
and a moſt glorious nature, and hath deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it as well as gained it, having done as
eminent things as ever Man of his age and
condition. Riches and Grandeurs do not
at all blind him or allure his mind to a higher
or more eager flight than becomes him:
But had he occaſions of enterprizing things
ſatisfactory to the height and magnitude of
his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oul, his Element would be to conquer
Kingdoms. A great Princeſs and as fair as
great would have made it her glory to have
gained him for her Husband, but that ſhe
could not diſpoſe of her own will, nor could
he conclude it convenient for him to Marry
ſo famous a Parſonage. If he loves you, as
I have no reaſon to doubt but he does by the
teſtimonies that you have given us of it, and
your good Fortune brings you to be his
Wife, as I have hopes it will, you may with
a juſt confidence rank your ſelf among the
moſt happy Women of <hi>China.</hi> I know his
humour, I am acquainted with his Birth and
Education; I underſtand a great part of the
motions of his Life, and can therefore ſpeak
of him, as I do with aſſurance. You ſpeak
too much on his ſide, Sir, ſaid <hi>Dorame,</hi> not to
make him uppear amiable and to oblige me
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60972:29"/>
to court his neereſt friendſhip. Satisfied
therefore as I am, that you know he out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighs
<hi>Cartagenes,</hi> I am reſolved to follow
your adviſe and not by a diſ-ingenious, fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh,

more of your old ſervants, for the one <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidor's</hi>

ſoever. He who knows him, ſaid <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorix,</hi>
and will not acknowledge him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of worth, muſt be concluded either
to overflow with envy, or to be very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in judgment, I with a great deal of
Solicitouſneſs wiſh you married to him, and
I am in continual fear leaſt this good fortune
ſhould be raviſht from you by ſome ſiniſter
accident. Heaven, if it thinks good, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Dorame</hi> to him, will preſerve him from
me. You had ſeen him here at preſent had
not a quarrel between two of his friends
called him away; but to morrow he is to
return, and if he loves not me, yet he loves
his word better than to fail. I wiſh, reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Rolimon,</hi> that he veiled not his deſign
from you, and inſtead of going to agree
ſome friends is, not gone to fight ſome Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
Give not your ſelf the trouble of ſuch
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60972:30"/>
fears, replied <hi>Dorame</hi> to him, for I am very
certain he hath nothing of difference of his
own to decide with any body, having ſight
of a Letter which informed me he was only
arbitrator in a diſagreement of others. But
ſince you are pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ticularly acquainted, as you
was ſaying, with his life; the Hiſtory of it,
during his abſence, would be a diverſion very
agreeable to me if not a labor too trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to you, You could not ask me a thing,
anſwered her, <hi>Rolimon,</hi> which is more
to my mind, than to entertain you
with what I underſtand of his affairs,
and if you will not give me that attention
which I may claim as their right, I doubt
not but to make you confeſs that few things
more conſiderable have come to your ears.

The Pomp of his Birth was equal to the

Nature had taken a pleaſure to render com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.
They themſelves indeed could not
look upon him without fancying his eyes,
beamings of a Genius that promiſed nothing

of their Fancy; for by that time he had
gotten over four years he delighted himſelf

King, having obliged him to hold a general
Counſell of the Kingdom for recompenſing
the good, puniſhing the bad, and ſetting
right what was out of order.</p>
               <p>All quarrels appeaſed between the two
Royall Brothers, the Revolters ſent abroad
their Manifeſto's, and in calming this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance,
was the King detained when
came Deputies of the Province of <hi>Loxa</hi> to
beg ſuccors of him, and to demand the
Prince his Brother for Protector of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
againſt the <hi>Indians.</hi> What they askt
they obtained; <hi>Arcantus</hi> was preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
Lieutenant General, and with a
conſiderable ſum took his way to <hi>Brema,
Alcidor</hi> both by the Prince's invitation, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60972:33"/>
by the inſtigation of his own humor went
one of the company thither, and he ſaw
there ſo much Honor paid to <hi>Arcantus</hi> and
ſo much affection ſhewed to the meaneſt of
his retinue, that he was ready to repute
their aboade there for that of <hi>Florimen's</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
and that fair Town for the Floriſhing
City of <hi>Paquin.</hi> All were indeed received
by their new Hoſts with as much kindneſſes,
as if they had been in their own Houſes
but they ill repaid their kindneſſes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>and
and by grand diſorders made them too
quickly reckon, that the <hi>Chinoiſe</hi> tuition was
leſs eaſie to brook than the <hi>Indian</hi> Tyranny.
In ſhort, whatſoever good order <hi>Arcantus</hi>
could take, who in an exemplary manner
cauſed the inſolents to be puniſht, they
who were called in for ſuccour loaded with
ſuch ill uſages by thoſe that had called them,
that to diſenſlave and revenge themſelves
together, they turned to weave conſpiracies
againſt them, and reſolved by an univerſal
Maſſacre to diſgorge them. From the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
they ſoon paſt to the execution, and it
was ſo bloudy a one, that the Prince did not
but with much difficulty ſave himſelf from it.
A great part of his People were aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in <hi>Brema,</hi> and <hi>Alcidor</hi> had in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
ran the ſame fortune, had not the
faithful <hi>Turgiſtus</hi> kept him concealed in his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60972:33"/>
Houſe till the rage of the multitude was
blown over. His Prince having left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him that infamous aboade, when ſo
much nobleneſs had in a moſt horrid
manner a Burying place given them,
not ſeeing him among thoſe that eſcaped,
believed without any farther hopes and
therefore not without a Pathetick ſorrow
that he had been Sacrificed to the ſame bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
fury with the reſt. With the ſame
ſad concluſion were <hi>Miraldus</hi> and <hi>Deifila,</hi>
after all the information that they could get,
forced to ſit down, wholly overwhelmed
with grief. But while they were lamenting
him as dead, he on a ſudden preſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to them alive and well, and together
with himſelf <hi>Turgiſtus</hi> as the invaluable
freind who had firſt ſaved him from the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt,
and then taking the advantage of the
fair weather that ſucceded it had put him in
diſguiſe and conducted him to them. That the
ſight of him did in a moment change all their
blacks into colors of extream joy and that his
Deliverer had large heaps of remunerations
thrown upon him, I ſupoſe, I need not tel you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Orastes</hi> and his confederates, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> able
better to authorize their Monopolies than
by ſetting the Subject againſt the King, did
by their ſubtle acts ſo effectually work them
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60972:34"/>
to their purpoſe that to hear their inſolent
diſcourſes of their Sovereign and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
would have inclined one to ſay
that he was bound to hold in fee of their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priciouſneſs.
In proſecution of this they
took up Arms and brought into the World
the deſigns which they had been a long time
hatching, by the ſame means ſending <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantus</hi>
out of it, who with greif to ſee his
Brother and the Kingdom involved in the
confuſion of a ſixth civil War, wherein alſo
he ſaw his own pretenſions reverſed, fell
ſick and dyed. After his death the King who
had no Child cauſed <hi>Potianis</hi> to be received
as the firſt Prince of the Bloud and Prime
Victory of <hi>China.</hi> Where the Leagurers
deriving freth pretexts of diſſatisfaction
ſpake not of the King but with an unſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
contempt, told the Multitude that
<hi>Polianis</hi> would bring the true Religion of
<hi>China</hi> under the yoke of the new Sectaries,
ſowed abroad defamatory Libels, vigorouſly
carried on their Counſels in the Provinces
of <hi>Iroquiam</hi> and <hi>Cantan,</hi> begot a numerous
increaſe to their party in <hi>Paquin</hi> and every
where induced the People to riſe, who
were otherwiſe diſpoſed to it by the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Court. To prevent the ruine
which by this means hung over the Publick
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60972:34"/>
and to that purpoſe to waſh away the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of the Confederacy that threatned
it, the King diſpatcht Letters into all his
Provinces, wherein he obliged the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
of places and perſons of quallity not
to abandon his ſervice and the common
good. Among theſe, <hi>Alcidor,</hi> though emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
recommendable for his Birth Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
Vertues and Intereſts, and though
Maſter of a very large Eſtate which his late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deceaſt Father had left him, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
to be put by the King. This for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs,
boyling with a generous heat of
Soul, he took for a Mark of contempt, and
was toucht with it to the quick: from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
he proceeded to a conſideration of
conſcience, and repreſenting to himſelf
that the Party of the League was of the true
Religion and undertook its defence againſt
the other, he grew to an opinion that to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them was to fight for God. Notice of his
diſcontent by ſome factious inſtruments
brought to <hi>Oraſtes,</hi> he quickly ſent to viſit
him with Officers of all the Advantages
which in ſuch a War he could on his ſide
hope for, and when, not a little pleaſed to
ſee himſelf ſought to by a Prince of ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
a name and ſwaying influence he as
he thought himſelf bound to do, went to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60972:35"/>
him, that perfect Courtier by the inevitable
ſpels with which he laid hold upon him
brought him with fervour to embrace his
ſide againſt that of his Sovereign. Which
done, to keep him his, as he made him, and
withal to take the benefit of his being ſo, he
gave him Moneys and Commiſſion to raiſe
five hundred Horſe, and he in execution of
the truſt was on a ſudden ſeen at the head of
many ſilent Men, attempting and atchieving
things which, called, not only the vulgar but
the braveſt of the Nation to take notice of
him with admiration, and which particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
purchaſed him the good will of <hi>Liſantus</hi>
one of the moſt Gallant chiefs of the party.</p>
               <p>The heads of the League, to give it good
colour and to draw ſtrength to it, had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht
very ſpecious principles as motives of it,
and had conjured the Princes, Nobles and
Commons to ſtand up for the Antient faith
againſt the Novel, which they ſaid the King
favoured againſt them, by that Lure decoying
into them multitudes of credulous People.
To impede this the King put abroad a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in which he cleared himſelf from the
ſeveral blots wherewith they aſperſed him
and particularly teſtified that he bore a
ſincere and conſtant love to the ſettled Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of <hi>China;</hi> that which diſarmed a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60972:35"/>
great number of People and ſome of them
very conſiderable; but not <hi>Alcidor,</hi> who
perſiſted ſo affectionate to the cauſe which he
had eſpouſed, believeing himſelf bound to
venture, and if need required, to ſpend his
Life in its quarrel, that nothing but death
ſeemed of power to diſcover him from it.
In proportion to his affection did his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Prudence labour for its advantage,
but notwithſtanding all the endeavors both
of him and others to hold it up, they ſaw
it in a ſhort time ſo enfeebled and bent to
fall that they were conſtrained to incline to
peace, and to return it, not for always, yet
at leaſt for a time to the obedience of their
King.</p>
               <p>It was indeed no long time before they
who had been ſo forced to lay down their
Arms had taken them up again; which <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anis</hi>
ſeeing put himſelf in the Field with a
very conſiderable Strength, and as firſt
Prince of the Bloud declareing their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
Felonious proteſted, he would as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
as neceſſarily defend againſt them the
prerogative of the King, the State of the
Queen Mother, and the fundamental Laws
of the Realm. In ſequel of this the War
becoming open, <hi>Alcidor</hi> got on Horſe back
and ranged himſelf in the Army that was
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60972:36"/>
led by <hi>Lucimon,</hi> where continually ſeeking
occaſions of Action he ſignalized his vertue
and aggrandized his name by deeds, which
were altogether wonders. But he could not
by all that he could do, protect that Brother
of <hi>Oraſtes</hi> from being as continually moleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo in ſeveral Battels notably beaten by the
Brother-in-law of <hi>Florimen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucimon</hi> after a while advancing to <hi>Paquin,</hi>
whoſe Inhabitants had been diligently cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed
to ſtir, and lookt with jealouſie upon the
intervier which <hi>Polianis</hi> and the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had lately had, and there by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of <hi>Oraſtes</hi> whom they worſhipt as a God,
making what impreſſion upon them he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
<hi>Oraſtes,</hi> himſelf in another quarter
with loud and ſharp invectives complaining
of the King that he had labored againſt his
own work by revoking an authentick Edict
of Peace by another which he had made
ſince, carried on the War with a very ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and potent hand. In the end the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
being called in by him and following his
call, and the Kingdom being on all ſides
imbraced with Hoſtility, the Opponent
Armies came to a bloody Fight, in which
<hi>Lucoris</hi> was ſlain, <hi>Polianis</hi> remained Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious,
and the vanquiſht were reduced
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60972:36"/>
to ſuch an univerſal diſorder, extream confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and miſerable eſtate that they who eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
from the deluge of blood that was ſhed,
had wholly expoſed themſelves to the mercy
of the Conquerors, had it not been for
<hi>Alcidor,</hi> who as in the Battel, ſo in the
rout and Flight, did all that it was poſſible
for a Man of heart, to do. He with a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
which can never be too much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
carried of the ſaid relicks of the
ſhipwrack, drew them into a Body and
offered fair for the repairing of the loſs.
But the Commanders proved too timerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affected towards the undertaking, and
the Soldiers more eager of ſecuring, than
of hazarding themſelves and of running a
way than of Fighting again.</p>
               <p>The revolt was thus ſet at Bay; but the
principal Authors of it determined, rather
to Abyſs themſelves in the ruines of the
State, than change the courſe which they had
begun: and preſently the King from all
parts received Advertiſement of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring
of his Subjects. For the neceſſary
ſecurity therefore both of his Perſon and
his head City, he put a Garriſon in it; which
<hi>Oraſtes</hi> looking upon as intended a curb to
his ambitious practiſes he ſo powerfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
the people that they fall to barricading
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60972:37"/>
and committed ravages altogether unworthy
of <hi>Chinoiſes,</hi> and which made the King
leave <hi>Paquin</hi> to go ſeek a ſhelter againſt the
ſtorm that threatned his life. The King, and
with him the Court gone, the Miſerable
Citizens ſenſible of the wound which they
had thereby received, repented of their
diſobedience and deſired the Parliament to
beg their Pardon and humbly beſeech his
Majeſty to return to his Palace, and by his
preſence reſtore to that great Town the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
Emoluments which his removal
had taken from them. But this, reckoning
himſelf juſtly incenſt, he reſolvedly denied;
his denial very much perplext both the
People and their leaders, and to warrant
themſelves from the miſcheifs which they
ſaw were likely to fall upon their heads they
ſet new Engines on work and made new
experiments. <hi>Florimen</hi> on the other ſide ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
both againſt them, and thoſe of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Religion, and againſt both obtained ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
important victories; All things went to
his advantage. Which <hi>Oraſtes</hi> ſeeing, and
that after whatſoever manner he ſteered his
deſigns they ſailed not with an untoward
wind, he demanded an aſſemby of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Counſel of the Kingdome to the end, as
he ſaid, of re-eſtabliſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d peace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60972:37"/>
the King's Subjects in a perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
The King having granted what he
demanded, and opened that great Court
with a ſpeech, of which the Eloquence and
Conduct made him admired for one of the
wiſeſt and moſt excellent heads that wore a
Crown, he, who had braved his authority
confidently, preſented himſelf before him,
and he received him with a gratious aſpect,
but not long after by the adviſe of his
Counſel diſpatcht him out of the World.
Upon notice of which Execution the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Paquin</hi> broke out into extremeties
which trampled all their allegiance under
foot, and in revenge of it <hi>Lucimon</hi> raiſed
them that were exaſperated in plain rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and after their example ſeveral of their
chief Towns of <hi>China,</hi> and having gained
a formidable ſtrength advanced towards
<hi>Florimen</hi> with a confidence of making him
his Priſoner. But upon intiligence of his
enterprize <hi>Polianis</hi> reconciled himſelf
with the King, employed his Arms in his
ſuccor and forc't the Enemy to fly. In this
occaſion was <hi>Alcidor</hi> engaged on the ſide
of <hi>Lucimon</hi> and performed all the parts of
a Man of courage but was conſtrained to
give place to Equity and Force.</p>
               <p>A little after having notice that his friend
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60972:38"/>
                  <hi>Tyrenas</hi> was taken Priſoner and kept at <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanfu</hi>
he contrived and effected the conveiy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of a Letter to him, wherein he aſſured
him that he would, if poſſible, ſuddenly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
his liberty, either by Money, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,
or ſome other means; and what he
promiſed he faithfully endeavored by Offers
of tearmes, but altogether unprofitably.</p>
               <p>He therefore wove a project of ſurprizing
the place, which he communicated to <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantus,</hi>
and which he highly approving they
cauſed a ſilent number of Souldiers to be
habited like villagers, but armed under their
habits, and ſent them with inſtructions under
ſhew of going to Market to ſeize one of the
gates, but before thy could ſeize it they
were diſcovered and the body of the guard
alarrumed. They, notwithſtanding that,
after a hot aſſault and vigorous reſiſtance
made themſelves Maſters of it. At the
noiſe which they made <hi>Alcidor</hi> powred in
with the Men which he had in readineſs for
the purpoſe, and after him <hi>Liſantus</hi> with a
greater force, and having taken the firſt
Body of the Guard and all without, ſeized
a Canon that was pointed againſt them,
and pointed it againſt the Town. Amazed
with which, and looking upon themſelves
as unable to reſiſt, thoſe of the Garriſon
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60972:38"/>
received the Laws of the Conqueror. I

renas</hi> to find himſelf at liberty and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
that he made to the Authors
of it; they are eaſie enough to be immagined.</p>
               <p>In this part of the relation <hi>Dorame,</hi> could
not forbear interrupting her Uncle and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him that all the actions of <hi>Alcidor</hi> had
ſo much Beauty in them that ſhe let none
of them paſs without giving them accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations;
but this laſt of all the reſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
eſpecially, added ſhe, that ſuch
men who will hazard their lives for them
whom they pretend to love, are very rare
in this age, in which falſhood and diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
raign far more powerfully than either
Fidelity or freeneſs. It is uſual with <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidor,</hi>
Coſin returned <hi>Roliman</hi> to her, to
perform that which is not uſual with others,
and there are ſeveral paſſages of his ſtory,
yet behind by which you will ſee he hath
an unqueſtionable title to more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Encomiaſticks and that upon the ſcore
not of one only but of many vertues.</p>
               <p>A Few days after the ſurpiſal of <hi>Chinanfu,</hi>
went he on, <hi>Alcidor</hi> had information brought
him that the Governour whom he and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantus</hi>
had placed in it, deſigning to better
his fortune by betraying his truſt, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60972:39"/>
to diſpoſe it to the ſervice of the King;
with which he having acquainted <hi>Liſantus,</hi>
they only with two Men put themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the place, ſecretly called together ſome
of the principal Perſons of it, and by the
Oratory that they uſed moulded them into
the form that they deſired. That done
they aſſembled the chief of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour's
Party and with the Poniard at their
throat made them promiſe to ſerve the
League; they turned out the old Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and ſettled one of approved Integrity
in his room, they took an Oath of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of all the People, and made the Garriſon
moſt firmly theirs.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had they with a great deal of
honour accompliſht this, which they had
with enough of danger enterprized, but
<hi>Lucimon</hi> informed of <hi>Florimens</hi> advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Paquin</hi> conjured <hi>Alcidor</hi> with all

But with this part of his life, I am not
throughly acquainted particularly not with
the love, which they ſay, he and the Princeſs
<hi>Floriſſa</hi> had at that time for one another.
Hearing him ſay ſo, I am very ſorry, ſaid

and which I aſſure my ſelf is none of the

indeed very divertiſing, ſaid <hi>Vindorix,</hi> and
ſuch that one cannot well hear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having one's ſpirit made a kind of a
Priſoner to them. You have then a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of them, ſaid <hi>Dorame</hi> to him. I have
a great deal of reaſon to blame my Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
reſumed <hi>Rolimon,</hi> for not re-calling
that my Nephew was during all the Siege
ſhut up in <hi>Paquin</hi> with <hi>Alcidor;</hi> ſo that
there is no body who ſo well as he can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
his ſtory from having one of his chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ornaments retrencht. I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
reparted <hi>Vindorix,</hi> I not only was
a witneſs of the Atchievements of War
which <hi>Alcidor</hi> performed in that Siege, but
I was alſo no ſtranger to the intrickes of love
which paſt then between him and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<hi>Floriſa.</hi> I was for that time his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
in Arms, and he made few enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes
upon our Enemyes in which I was
not his aſſiſtant. One deſigne had engaged
us to the League, and reckoning to act
vigorouſly for our conſcience and glory, we
upon all occaſions put our ſelvs upon dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
for a party which we have ſince found
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60972:40"/>
unjuſt and too late abandoned. But, not
to waſt time in that which is nothing to our
preſent purpoſe, I ſhall give you all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that I can of that which you deſire to
know.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Vindorix</hi> was opening his mouth to
begin what he had to ſay, word was brought
to <hi>Dorame</hi> that there were two Gentlemen
alighted who deſired to pay her their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.
Having ſent back him who brought
the word to conduct them in, and riſing up
to go and receive them, ſhe ſaw enter her
Chamber two near Kinſmen of <hi>Cloriaſtes</hi>
who a little before would have Duelled
<hi>Cartagenes</hi> as his rival in her love. <hi>Rolimon,
Orlian</hi> and <hi>Vindorix,</hi> being well acquainted
with them, quickly learnt what it was that
had brought them thither. Which being
to ſolicite <hi>Dorame</hi> to accept their kinſman
for her Husband, <hi>Rolimon</hi> made ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal
to them of the refuſal which ſhe had
given him and his companions ſuing for
<hi>Cartagenes,</hi> that they lookt upon it as unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
for them to imagine that they could
obtain of her for their friend what her Uncle
and Couſins could not for theirs. They
were made yet farther to deſpair of prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with her by <hi>Vindorix</hi> aſſuring them that
there had paſt mutual profeſſions of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60972:40"/>
between her and <hi>Alcidor.</hi> In the laſt
place <hi>Dorame</hi> herſelf deprived them of all
hope, ſpeaking to them of <hi>Alcidor</hi> as of
one whom ſhe had reaſon to love, and
whom therefore ſhe really did love above
all thoſe who had made ſuite to her. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
therefore to diſapprove the choice that
ſhe had made and unwilling to travel their
ſpirits to make Marble ſenſible, they ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded

<hi>Dorame</hi> get all Night,
Diſquieted with the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which ſhe had of a

preſenting it ſelf to her;
the more ſhe conſidered
of which the more ſhe imagined <hi>Alcidor</hi>
dead, and the more this indignation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
upon her, the more increaſed her
inquietudes. Her ſighes reaching the ears
of <hi>Oriana</hi> and <hi>Milſinda,</hi> her women, they
roſe, lighted Candles, inquired into her
new trouble, and finding what ill impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhe had concieved, endeavored all
that they were able to remove it. But it
had taken too deep root to be on a ſudden
pulled up; only their remonſtrances and
the light of the Candles together in ſome
meaſure leſſened the diſturbance that it gave
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60972:42"/>
her. Perceiving which, though ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to their Beds, they would
not be over-ruled to leave her till it was day
and that ſhe had in a good part laid aſide
her black fancy. The day advancing and
ſhe keeping her Bed to redeem the repoſe
of which the diſpleaſures of the night had
robbed her, it was not long before a kind
ſleep lockt up her ſenſes and cares together.
Which laſting ſome hours and then leaving
her very well refreſht, ſhe was told as ſoon
as ſhe was throughly awake that <hi>Rollmon;
Vindorix</hi> and the others having heard of
her ill reſt waited to know when they might
with her convenience viſit her. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ſending them word that ſhe was ready
to bid their company welcome, they came
all into her Chamber; where after they
had heard from her own mouth what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance

               <hi>Dorame</hi> was deeply ſtruck with the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
and witneſſed by plenty of tears the
lively ſenſe which ſhe had of it, together
with the good eſteem in which ſhe had the
unhappy lover. Oh the ſtrange effects of
Love, cryed <hi>Rolimon! Cartagenes</hi> ingaged
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60972:43"/>
us to ſeek <hi>Dorame</hi> in Marriage for him, and
in his ſoul thought of dying. Pardon me,
Sir, ſaid <hi>Limonides</hi> to him, my Maſter
thought of nothing leſs than fighting when
he gave you the pains of comming hither,
he had at that time nothing in his mind but
his Love; but there afterwards evened o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things which begot in him an intention
of fighting, that ſo he might confer and
vindicate his honour. But whence, <hi>Limo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides,</hi>
ſaid <hi>Dorame,</hi> ſprung his quarrell
with <hi>Alcidor?</hi> That you ſhould know it,
Madam, replied <hi>Limonides,</hi> was part of
his will before he dyed, of which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
me his Executor. Inſtantly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that my Lords who are here, Your
Uncle and Couſins were gone from his
Houſe, came in <hi>Almidon</hi> to him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me told him ſo many things to provoke
him, that unleſs he had been altogether ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
or a coward he would by no means have
remained without an angry reſentment.
Among other things he told him, that
<hi>Alcidor</hi> having with little paines acquired
your favour ſo as to be declared your
ſervant and owned by you for ſuch, had
to your ſelf in the preſence of many
perſons of quallity ſpoken ſo diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly
and contemptuoſly of him that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60972:43"/>
he could not believe himſelf his friend, did
he not give him notice of it, and farther
wirh all his power aſſiſt him to recover ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of the injury. <hi>Cartagenes</hi> having
with impatience enough heard what he ſaid,
If you did not aſſert it, <hi>Alcidor</hi> ſaid he, I
ſhould have a great deal of difficulty to
believe that <hi>Alcidor</hi> who is eſteemed one of
the moſt generous of men would diſcourſe
of me to her whom I adore; or indeed to
any Body otherwiſe than he in equity
and Candor ought. Hath he beſides ever
known me tamely pocket up an affront that
he ſhould take the confidence to give me ſo
cruel a one? But I have a way to arreſt his
inſolency, and if there be nothing beſides the
Beauty of <hi>Dorame,</hi> that is enough to make
me Valiant, if not invincible. At theſe words
<hi>Almidon</hi> ſaying that it belonged to him to
ſerve him in revenge of the injury who had
informed him of it, <hi>Cartagenes</hi> drew him
aſide and for ſome time held a diſcourſe
with him, of which I confeſs I had more than
ordinary apprehenſions. I knew <hi>Almidon</hi>
to be a turbulent and unlucky intermedler,
I knew alſo that he had a deſign of drawing
my Maſter to the ſearch of his Couſin <hi>Lidia;</hi>
I therefore eaſily believed that he had upon
that account brewed this quarrel for him.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60972:44"/>
               <hi>Almidon</hi> gone, <hi>Cartagenes</hi> paſt the reſt of
the day in Melancholy. At night when he
was going to Bed remembring that I had
heard the greateſt part of what <hi>Almidon</hi> and
he had ſaid to one another, could you have
ever thought, ſaid he to me, that <hi>Alcidor</hi>
would have thus abuſed me? I cannot be
induced, Sir, returned I to him, to give
any credit to what hath been told you, and
I wiſh for your quiet you would not at all
regard it. To this he replied nothing but
bid me put him to bed, which I did and
gave him the good-night. Next morning at
point of day he called me to dreſs him,
which done, he took horſe (and I with
him) to go to ſee one of his friends. By the
way (I know not what ill fortune would
have it ſo) he about the middle of the day
took a path which he was never, that I know
of, wont to follow. Having followed it
ſome Miles he happened to meet <hi>Alcidor,</hi>
whom accoſting with a bold roughneſs, he
angrily enough demanded of him the reaſon
why he had ſpoken ſo unhandſomly of him
to <hi>Dorame,</hi> To that, you ſhould learn to
know me better, replied <hi>Alcidor,</hi> than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that I am of a humor to offend any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
without reaſon; and the injury that you

               </gap>o me in taking up that ill opinion of me is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60972:44"/>
greater than that which it ſeems you take
for granted I have done you. But beſides
this, the Lovely <hi>Dorame</hi> deſerves that we
ſhould make one thruſt with our Swords, as
I ſee you have a mind we ſhould; and I
take mine in my hand, continued he, to let
you know that I will have the glory of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her alone, engaged both by what he
had ſaid himſelf, and by <hi>Alcidors</hi> words
and action my Maſter drew together with
him, but wholly to his misfortune. For
though he was well mounted and (as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
known) very ſtout, he quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved
two wounds, one of which being
in his belly gave him only leaſure to get to
a little houſe hard by where they fought, to
write the Letter that I have brought you,
and juſt as he expired to command me to
give you, together with that, an account of
his diſaſter. But I muſt not forget, added
<hi>Limonides,</hi> the generouſneſs of <hi>Alcidor,</hi> who,
when he ſaw his adverſary tumble to the
ground at the ſecond thruſt that he gave him,
jumpt from his Horſe to his ſuccor. Which
he who was fallen ſeeing, and getting up
of himſelf, trouble not your ſelf, brave
<hi>Alcidor,</hi> ſaid he, to help me; I am mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
wounded, and though with your
Sword <hi>Almidon</hi> is the cauſe of it. That
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60972:45"/>
baſe man ſhall dye, returned <hi>Aclidor</hi> to him,
or I will my ſelf periſh by that kind of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who are skilful to make more quarrels
than they are able to appeaſe. Believe me,
I never ſpake a word of you that could give
you a diſguſt. I am too certain of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
replied <hi>Cartagenes</hi> to him, to make
any further queſtion of it, and let you plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſee the baſeneſs of <hi>Almidon, Limonides</hi>
ſhall give you an account of the diſcourſe
which he yeſterday held to me, in the mean
time that we binde up my wounds and I
recover ſtrength to carry me to ſome place
where I may dye more conveniently than
here. Accordingly while <hi>Alcidor</hi> ſerved
my Maſter for Chyrurgion, I ſerved <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>
for intilligencer. Which done we had
only time to conveigh my Maſter to the
neareſt comodious place that we could find,
and there as ſoon as he had written to you
he dyed. An adventure Sir, ſaid <hi>Vindorix</hi>
to <hi>Floris,</hi> which challenges the tribute of
a weeping eye, and I fear, if ill Fortune
be not by ſome means of prevention made
to change her courſe, the ſame may arrive
to <hi>Cloriaſtes.</hi> To prevent that, returned
<hi>Floris</hi> to him, we will make haſt to him
and perſwade him to ſit down form his

with the frightful fanſies of the night,
roſe from her bed, and ſat down with her

Their backs being turned, <hi>Dorame</hi> took her
Uncle and Couſins into a private Chamber,

            <p>Alcidor having receaved the deſires of

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60972:48"/>
after the paſſages were all ſeized by the King,
the out workes attaqued and the ſeige for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
We lay not ſtill in this occaſion,
<hi>Alcidor</hi> had more gallantry and his Troopes
more ambition of fighting, we made a ſalley,
and in that firſt eſſay of our armes brought
backe advantages over our beſeigers which
cauſed fires of joy to be lighted through all
the City. Not ſatisfied with the triumph
unleſs ſhe ſaw him who had procured it,
<hi>Floriſa</hi> ſent for <hi>Alcidor</hi> to come to her, and
it was then that going along with him to her
I percieved by her eyes, words and whole
carriage not onely that his valour kept her
from ſhaking under the feares which ſhe had
of falling into the hands of her fathers ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
but alſo that his perſon was a great
deal more than indifferent to her. When
wee were going from her, you have not onely
Paquin to preſerve, <hi>Alcidor,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him,
you have alſo an unfortunate princeſſe under
your guard, take heed therefore how you
hazard your life ſince it is my ſupport. In
reply to this, I therefore make Eſteem of
Paquin, Madam, ſaid <hi>Alcidor,</hi> becauſe it
holds ſo rich a treaſure as the princeſſe <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſa.</hi>
Knowing indeed whence and what you
are I ſhould goe againſt my Conſcience,
ſhould I not ſet an higher value upon you
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60972:49"/>
than upon what I hold deareſt to me in the
world. Whatſoever conſiderations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I can have, the ambition which I have of
ſerving you will be ſure to ſurmount them
all, &amp; it will I hope not onely ſupply me with
boldneſs of heart but with prudence alſo to
manage it. This reply mooving ſo violently
her inmoſt veines, that there roſe a ſudden
crimſon from them and ſpred it ſelfe over
her face; ſhe left us with out ſaying any more
but that ſhe would have us ſee her often.
And in this wee obeyed her command; for
whatſoever imployments we had to remedy
the diſturbances which the enemy procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,
we forbore not to viſit her twice every
day, and after a while whither ſhe deſir'd him
ſo to doe or that it came of his owne motion
<hi>Alcidor</hi> tooke up a cuſtome of going fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to her without me. But on the other
ſide whatſoever intreaties ſhe uſed to him,
and ſhe uſed, beſides that mentioned before,
very many and earneſt ones not to throw
himſelfe into danger, he forbore not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to ingage himſelfe in the midſt of
the enemy, doing things which made every
body have him in their mouths for a kinde of
miracle.</p>
            <p>If we were active, our beſeigers were not
idle, making atempts which for ſome time
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60972:49"/>
kept us day and night at worke. From which
having one afternoone a little releaſe I made
uſe of it to goe viſit <hi>Alcidor:</hi> but coming to
his lodging. I found that he was gone to doe
the ſame to <hi>Floriſa.</hi> I nevertheleſſe went
into his chamber, where finding a booke
upon his table I opened it, and turning over
the firſt leafe of it I ſaw a letter drop,
which, out of a curioſity to know more of
my friends particularities than I believed he
had imparted to me, taking up and unfolding
I read in it theſe words.</p>

to make any queſtion of the advantage which I
derive from your converſe. Make haſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>The fortune which I ſaw by this letter
was arrived to <hi>Alcidor</hi> ſurprized me with a
guſt that was very acceptable to me, but not
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60972:50"/>
without an allay when I conſiderd that he
might not draw all that ſatisfaction from the
affections of ſo high a perſon which he might
from thoſe of a meaner. The letter for feare
that if I left it, where I found it, it might bee
found by ſome other as it had been by me,
or elſe might bee wholly loſt I carried with
me to my lodgings; where aſſoone as I was
entred <hi>Alcidor</hi> coming to ſeek me, all his
diſcourſe to me was of <hi>Floriſa</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
of the viſit which he came from making
to her, and in his diſcourſes he could not
with all his arts ſo well diſſemble but that he
often changed colour, and diſcovered by
many teſtimonyes that another God beſides
<hi>Mars</hi> had made him his votary; but yet he
tooke not any notice to me of the princeſſe's
writing to him, nor did I therefore to him
that I knew any thing of it. I on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
induſtriouſly abſtained from ſpeaking any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of her to him at all, much more of her
merite. But the more I ſhunned that theam,
the more he preſt it. To ſee therefore whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his paſſion would carry him I made it
my buiſineſs to diſſent from what he ſaid,
which he tooke ſo ill, that to heare him chide
me would have diſpoſed one to judge that I
had committed ſome groſſe enormity.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Dorame</hi> interpoſing, it is not a little
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60972:50"/>
diſpleaſure, ſaid ſhe, which a Lover receaves
when one aproves not the prayſes which
he beſtowes upon her whom he loves. I told
you what deſigne I had in doing ſo, reſumed
<hi>Vindorix</hi> and therefore I was not at all ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with what <hi>Alcidor,</hi> ſaid to me, and I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
changing my ſtile ſpake ſo much
good of the Princeſs that he quickly changed
his alſo and gave me better words than he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
before had done. I then againe introduced
another ſubject, which was that of warre, but
it was eaſy for me to perceave that thoſe
words of Canon, powder musket, pike, ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not ſo well in his eares as thoſe of Love,
of <hi>Floriſa,</hi> and of her graces.</p>
            <p>After we had thus entertained our ſelves
a while at my chamber he carried me to his,
When a little after we were entered taking
up the booke in which I had found the letter,
he turned over the leaves, ran into his cloſet,
left no place unſearched, no ſervant unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned
for what he miſt. I asking him what it
was that he inquired for, he told me that it
was a paper of great importance to him. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I preſt him, not for feare of being ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
of taking away that of which the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
put him into ſo great pain; But when
I ſaw him by degrees calme himſelfe and his
ſpirit grow to ſome ſtillneſs, I ſecretly ſo
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60972:51"/>
that he not at all perceaved me, put the letter
under the tapeſtry of his table where he had
not yet ſearched, and then as if by chance
threw downe one of the ſides of the tape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
ſo that it let the letter dropp. Having

Nor Riches nor honours, <hi>Vindorix,</hi> ſaid

are ignorant that we poſſeſs them. Was I
monarch of the world, I ſhould not be ſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtied
if <hi>Vindorix</hi> had not knowledge of my

had happened to him which lay hid from me.
Reade this letter, my deare companion, ſaid
he to me and you will know what a liberall
benefactreſs Fortune hath beene to me with
which words, he putting it into my hand, I
tooke it and after ſome ceremony that I uſed

read to my ſelfe.</p>

diſcord. Why returned <hi>Vindorix</hi> to
her, did I doe any thing in this which can
be accounted a breach of freindſhip or which
the beſt freind in the world would not have
done? For all my talking, ſaid <hi>Dorame</hi> to
him againe, I really blame you not at all;
but I pray goe on with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>our relation. To
goe on with it, reſumed <hi>Vindorix, Alcidor</hi>
after I had read the letter told me that he
had things to recount to me which I could
not heav without ſurprize, and preſently
uſed this diſcourſe to me.</p>
            <p>It is a ſtrange power that of love, which
we in vain inforce our ſelves to reſiſt. Who
would have ever thought that I who perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
made a mocke of love, ſhould come to
be ſhut up in this beſeiged City to be made
ſubject to that which I made a mocke of? I
thought of vanquiſhing, and I am vanquiſht; I
aimed at triumphing over brigades of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile
men, and I am overcome by a maide a
friend. You, divine <hi>Floriſa,</hi> have inſlaved
me to your lawes, but by a force the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
in the world as well as the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive.
You cannot but remember, my
<hi>Vindorix,</hi> the day, the houre, the moment
that we had firſt the bliſſe of wayting upon
her, ſay truly, have you ever met with a
face more beautifull, a proportion more
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60972:52"/>
exact, a ſpirit more fine, a port more grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full?
I know not how ſhe appeared to your
eyes, but in mine ſhe had altogether as much
beauty and Majeſty (be it ſpoken without
injury to her virtue) as ever the poets attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to the Miſtreſſe of the God of warre.
Interpoſing here, having then and ſince, ſaid
I, with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> conſiderd the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes
wherwith heaven hath furniſht her, I
cannot ſay that ſhe hath parallel. This is,
rejoined <hi>Alcidor,</hi> to judge of things as they
deſerve, and ſince to you I neither ought to
diſſemble nor will, I acknowledge that from
the firſt moment wherein I ſaw this unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleld
woman, I conceaved a paſſion for
her; all the time that we were then with
her, I thought of nothing but of her, I ſcarce
conſiderd that I was in Paquin to defend it
and had my ſelfe alſo to take care of. When
we were parted I ſet my ſelfe ſeriouſly to
ſtudy both of her perfection, and my owne
change which ſprang from them, and I
ſtrongly endeavoured to beate out the
power which I found had ſurprized my
heart, but I was forced to leave my ſelfe to
be vanquiſht by that which I plainely ſaw I
was not able to fight with.</p>
            <p>The Princeſs you know, added he, from
the good ſucceſs which we had of our ſwords
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60972:52"/>
when our beſeigers firſt approached the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
drawing an occaſion of ſending for u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to give us the congratulations which ſhe
thought fit, it was from that time that
I knew that ſhe tooke a more than a common
if not a very affectionate intereſt in me. One
muſt indeed have been blinde, interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
I him, or elſe wholly deprived of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
not to draw that concluſion from all
her deport towards you, particularly what
other interpretation than that could be made
of thoſe words which ſhe uſed to you at par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
you have not onely Paquin to preſerve
but alſo an unhappy Princeſs to guard; take
heed therefore how you hazard your life
leaſt by looſing that you doe injury to mine
by deſpoiling it of its ſupport.</p>
            <p>After this, went he on, I many times viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her without your knowledge, and as
many times received teſtimonies of her
kinde inclinations towards me. One time
among the reſt ſhe was pleaſed in plaine
tearmes to tell me that my perſon and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
were very agreeable to her, and that
ſhe made more account of me than of all
men in the world together; and I let not the
opportunity ſlip by without improoving it,
but tooke courage from what ſhe ſaid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to her in the moſt reſpectfull phraſe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60972:53"/>
that I could invent, that I had dedicated me
ſelfe entirely to her as to the moſt abſolute
peice of divinity among mortalls. In anſwer
to which, you doe not at all diſoblige me,
<hi>Alcidor,</hi> ſaid ſhe, in letting me know that you
have an affection for me: Love me as much
as you are deare to me, and I aske no more to
be the moſt contented woman that lives.
Impregnated with joy to heare her ſay ſo,
The Goodneſs, Madam, replyed I to her,
which you are pleaſed to teſtifie towards
me fills me with an inebriating glory, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>krupts
my gratitude, and leaves me nothing
to doe in the world but by your premiſſion
to be all my life in the quality of your ſlave,
paying as much as I can of what I owe to
your birth merite and bounty. Her Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
coming in, as I ſaid ſo, I held my
tongue and laid a reſtraint upon my carriage;
ſeeing which, have no reſerve, <hi>Alcidor,</hi>
ſaid ſhe to me, becauſe of <hi>Leonora,</hi> for ſhe
knowes all my ſecrecies; from the moment
that I loved your vertue, I made her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with it, and ſhe inſtead of diſſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
me from it, repreſented many things
to me on your ſide, which ſerved to make me
more highly eſteeme you. Hearing this, I
muſt be ſtupified, Madame, returned I to
her, not to thinke that I have an obligation
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60972:53"/>
to her which is not eaſily diſcharged, and I
ſhould deſerve nothing but ill offices from
her inſtead of good ones, ſhould I not ſeek
occaſion of thanking her. With wich words
pulling a diamond from my finger I intreated
her to wear it as pledge that I was ſenſible
of the favours which ſhe had done me, and
ſhe by the princeſſe's command accepted it.
After this, Love, inſtead of abaſing my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
raiſed it, and beleiving it my duty to
performe ſomething anſwerable to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of my affections and to the honour
that the princeſs deigned me, I often with
you, <hi>Vindorix,</hi> you know, ſaught occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of remarkable actions, and one day
eſpecially having no more eyes than love
that conducted me, I blindely precipitated
myſelfe into dangers, out of which had not
you drawne me, I cannot ſee but that I had
in all probability periſht. Returning victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the City, the paines which we had
taken in the fight requiring that we ſhould a
little reſt our ſelves, we as you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
left one another to go to our ſeveral
lodgings. Come to mine, it was not many
moments that I had ſhut my ſelfe into my
cloſet and laid me downe upon my couch,
not ſo much to repoſe my ſelfe as to thinke of
<hi>Floriſa,</hi> when one of her pages brought me

            <p>Going the next morning and ſurprizing
her in bed with <hi>Leonora</hi> entertaining her,
after ſhe had made me take a ſeate by her
bedsſide and given me her hand, which
without conſidering that it was too much
for me to attempt, I kiſt when I tooke it, I at
her command gave her a relation of the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
which we the day before had made.
While we were talking about which, her
hands playing with my locks, her boſome by
ſtealth diſcovered it ſelfe with beauties
which I greedily fed upon with my eyes,
but of which I durſt not owne the reliſh
which I had in my mind. The reſpect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
which I had for her put a ſtrict bridle
upon all my carriage towards her: which
ſhe obſerving, as if on purpoſe to make me
uſe more familiarity with her, ſhe uſed
more than formerly with me. I tooke the
overture and imprinted an hundred hot
kiſſes on her hand; which ſhe allowing I
ventured the ſame to her face and met with
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60972:55"/>
no repulſe. Our careſſes thus riſing by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
but no higher than was fitting, they
were ready to melt away my ſoule with
delight, when a ſtop was put to them by
the coming in of the Governor of the
Town. Hee held diſcourſes to her about
her Uncle <hi>Lucimon,</hi> and they were of ſuch
concernement as required her to write to
him. Which being done, and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
gone, ſhe told me ſhe would riſe. I
withdrew therefore into the antichamber,
where meeting with her Gentleman, I, while
ſhe was dreſſing, entertained myſelfe with
him, and learnt a great many things of him;
particularly whatſoever craft he uſed to hide
it, I obſerved that he had a deſigne of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovering
whether or no the Princeſs loved
me. To make me diſcloſe he told me that
never had ſhe eſteemed any man ſo much as
me, and that ſhe had allwayes my name
and actions in her mouth. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerd,
that it was proper to thoſe that were
great to ſpeake well of thoſe that were
mean, to the end to make their own vertue
ſhine more clearely, and to ſhew by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
thoſe that have little merite that
they know how to give true and juſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to them who deſerve them, and that if
ſhe at all conſiderd me I well knew it was
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60972:55"/>
only becauſe ſhe was ſo good as to thinke
that I might poſſibly bee helpfull to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the City. <hi>Placidas</hi> not finding my
diſcourſe ſuitable to his expectation, turned
his tongue to other ſubjects; but I inſenſibly
grew upon him and at laſt brought him to
advertiſe me that <hi>Lucimon</hi> had by a letter
which he had lately written to him, given
him charge watchfully to obſerve all the
actions of his neice, and withall to ſhew
me the letter; reading which I ſaw that the
viſits which I made to <hi>Floriſa</hi> were knowne
to that prince and ſuſpected by him. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thus learnt of him what it was, very
conducible to my advantage to know, I with
the beſt arguments that I could uſe perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him to be faithfull to his princeſs and
to informe her of whatſoever he ſhould
know was practiſed to her detriment: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
I adviſed him to give her notice
preſently of that which her Uncle had
wrote to him, but without ſignifying to
her that I knew any thing of it, adding that
I ſhould ſo well manage the tenure of my
cariage for the future that <hi>Lucimon</hi> ſhould
finde nothing in it to cenſure.</p>
            <p>According to my adviſe as ſoone as <hi>Placi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
knew that he might enter the princeſſe's
Chamber he went to her and gave her the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60972:56"/>
ſame intelligence that he had given me.
Upon which ſending him immediately for
me, ſcarce was I within her Chamber
dore but ſhe told me before him what he
had told her, not without diſcovering an
extreame diſcompoſure, and ſaying all that
could bee ſaid againſt a man, againſt <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
After ſhe had by words and teares
diſharged ſome of her vexation, I, with the
reſpect that was due to her and with the beſt
motives that I could thinke of, intreated her
not to be troubled at the buſineſs, adjoining
that rather than ſhe ſhould by occaſion of me
receive any thing of diſpleaſure, if my
being deprived of her ſight would remedye
it, though it would be a greater puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to me than I knew how to live under,
I would without diſputing it baniſh my ſelfe
from her preſence. Hearing me ſay ſo, I
am ſo far, <hi>Alcidor,</hi> reparted ſhe to me,
from having a minde that you ſhould abſent
yourſelfe from me becauſe of <hi>Lucimon,</hi> that
I would have you doe me the kindneſs of
viſiting me oftener then heretofore, that
being ſo ill treated by an uncle I may amidſt
my unhappineſſe have the conſolation of
being ſuccoured by one who hath no tie upon
him to doe it. Could it not ſuffice him to
have ſhut me up in this miſerable City
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60972:56"/>
which two potent Princes have for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of their indignation, and which could
not keep it ſelfe from falling under their
power, if your valour and conduct forbad it
not, without going about to double my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment
by reſtraining me from ſeeing
thoſe who can give my ſpirit ſome relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
what ſtrange Barbarouſneſs is this
and how little uſed by an Uncle to a neice?
Does he feare that I have a minde to take
from him the pretenſions which he makes to
the kingdom and to place the crowne upon
<hi>Alcidor's</hi> head, that he would not have him
come neare me? He is indeed abundantly
worthy of a ſcepter, but both his intentions
and mine are juſter and more moderate than
to aſpire to any ſuch thing, was it, as it is
not, in our power to attaine it. No, No
<hi>Alcidor,</hi> added ſhe to me, you muſt not
forſake me, it would be too much cruelty
in you to abandon a Princeſs that breathes
not, but by your aſſiſtance, and expects not
her deliverance but by your meanes. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſe
to this I ſaid all to her that love and
duty could ſuggeſt to me, to demonſtrate to
her my zeale of living and dying for her. All
which, both what ſhe ſaid and I, <hi>Placidas</hi>
hearing, and not being able to hear without
being certaine that there was a more than
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60972:57"/>
ordinary kindeneſs between us, he humbly
offered her to ſerve her to the utmoſt of his
capacity againſt her Uncle; and being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
commanded by her to eſteem me as
one to whom ſhe had great obligations, he
intreated me to beleive that I was Maſter of
his heart and that he would never have any
other inclinations than to doe me all the
good offices that he could. After which he
and <hi>Leonora</hi> leaving us together, we confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a while about <hi>Lucimon,</hi> thence we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to teſtifie our affections to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I with the beſt language that I could
put together, and ſhe with as many favours
as her vertue and modeſty would allow her
to beſtow upon me. She withall enjoined
me not to ſpeak a ſyllable of our corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencies
to any body; no, not to <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorix,</hi>
ſaid ſhe, for he is too much affected
with glory to like that you ſhould ingage
your ſelfe in love at a time ſo proper for
Armes. This is the ſole reaſon why I have
till now concealed from you my love and
the good fortune that I have had in it; You
therefore ought not to take it ill from me,
eſpecially conſidering that <hi>Floriſa</hi> hath no
ſooner given me liberty of acquainting you
with the ſecret (for it was but this after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone
that ſhe gave it me) but I have made
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60972:57"/>
uſe of it to let you ſee that I have nothing of
concerne which I am willing to reſerve from
your knowledge. To this I anſwered that
I lookt upon the injunction which the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
had laid upon him, not as an effect of
her ill will to me, but as a fruite of her pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which obliged her to diſtruſt all the
world in an affaire of ſo much conſequence,
that I ſhould have thought it very ill done of
him if he had not obeyed it, and that I had
a better ſenſe of the favour that ſhe had done
me in giving him leave to impart ſo much to
me as he now had done, than ever to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
it otherwiſe than to both their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.</p>
            <p>I having ſaid ſo, ſince that time, went
he on, I have very often been with her
without any body having cogniſance of it
but <hi>Placidas</hi> and <hi>Leonora,</hi> and I was never
with her but ſhe gave me demonſtrations
of her affection towards me, which as
they bred in me a rich delight, were
enough alſo to have begot in me a moſt fond
vaine-glory, if by a ſober reflection upon
my ſelfe I had not been throughly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with my unworthineſs of them. That
you may ſee, how far I am in her eſteeme,
added he, ſtepping to a little boxe of pearl
taking a paper out of it and bringing it to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60972:58"/>
me, read theſe few lines. Doing as he
deſired me, I found they held ſuch ſenſe
as this.</p>
            <p>Though poſſibly there bee few preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of marriage ſo exalted, which my
birth would not authorize me to make, the
worth which continually repreſents it ſelfe
to me in you hath ſo much of magneticke
influence upon me that my heart cannot
keep it ſelfe from being drawne and tied
faſt to you and that I cannot forbeare telling
you ſo. And this you ſhall never faile of
knowing, ſo long as you render your ſelfe
capable of doing ſo. But make no ill judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of my freeneſſe, for my virtue is no
otherwiſe intereſted by my affection than it
ought to be, and as it is moſt true that I
love you, ſo is it alſo that I love you in
ſuch a manner as chaſtity and ſageneſs allow,
and that I looke you ſhould continue in the
tearmes of reſpect that are due to me.</p>
            <p>When I had done reading theſe words,
not to detaine you any longer with this
concerne, adjoined <hi>Alcidor,</hi> I am at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
mounted to the higheſt ſtep of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that a vertuous love without marriage
is able to bring me to, and, if I may ſay ſo
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60972:58"/>
without imputation of arrogance, I have
reaſon to thinke that I may be to morrow
the husband of <hi>Floriſa,</hi> if I will. She every
day indeed preſſes me to be ſo, and though
I upon a manifold conſideration beleive that
I ſhall never have her for my wife I have
promiſed to make her ſo as ſoon as the
ſeige is raiſed, and in the meane time to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
my ſelfe for it by gaining as large a
ſtock of honour as I can.</p>
            <p>He thus concluding his diſcourſe to me, I
told him that he had certainly done very
well in ſatisfying the princeſs with thoſe
aſſurances that ſhe deſired, and that I made
no great queſtion but the terme which he
had taken for marrying her would produce
ſuch a revolution of affaires as would ſet
him at liberty to doe in that affaire accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as he ſhould ſee cauſe. Then, not thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it fitting to counſell a man whom his
diſcretion made him act well in every thing,
I onely let him know how deeply I accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my ſelfe in his debt, for communicating
to me the particularities of his affections,
and preſently we parted.</p>
            <p>Having ſuch within our walls as practiſed
for <hi>Polianis</hi> and carried on conſpiracies of
moment enough to have quickly deſtroyed
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60972:59"/>
us if we had not happily ſmelt them out and
provided againſt them, we were eight dayes
in remedying this deſeaſe which done we
made our beſeigers ſee that wee had not lay
ſtill but to take breath that we might fall
upon them with the more life, cutting our
way up to their trenches, putting them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a great diſorder and bringing backe a
great number of priſoners.</p>
            <p>There was againe nothing worth mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
attempted on our ſide till one day <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidor</hi>
without me, whither I was otherwiſe
buſied or that he had ſome other reaſon not
to take me along with him, iſſued out of
the Town accompanied onely with ten vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers
that put themſelves under his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
They were preſently ſet upon by twice
as many and were at length conſtrained to
give way to their ſtrength and retire. But
before <hi>Alcidor</hi> made his owne retreat, he
by amuzing the enemy gave his party leaſure
to make theirs. Upon which occaſion
ſtaying a little too long behind, after he
had maintained fight as long as he was able,
to put himſelfe out of the danger that he was
in, he leaped his horſe over a great ditch;
Thereupon one of thoſe whom he had to
deale with vainely enough u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>braided him
that he had the advantage of making him
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60972:59"/>
fly. To him, the advantage is, returned <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidor,</hi>
that you are ſo many, were you a
little fewer you ſhould quickly ſee me come
backe to you. It ſhall be your fault if you
come not, ſaid the other againe, for I
promiſe you, you ſhall have to doe with
none but me: try the adventure and you
ſhall ſee I will attend you as it in honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
<hi>Liſimax.</hi> Hearing him ſay ſo, <hi>Alcidor</hi>
was about to jumpe backe to him, but he at
the inſtant perceived about halfe a ſcore
horſemen galloping to intercept his way;
he therefore ſet ſpurs to his horſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired.</p>
            <p>Got into the Town he came and recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to me what had befallen him: he told
me withall that <hi>Liſimax</hi> being the favourite
of <hi>Florimen</hi> and of an applauded name, and
there, therefore being a great meaſure of
glory to be gotten by a ſingle combate with
him, he reſolved to demand it of him. The
reaſons which he alleadged for his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
inducing me to approve it, after I had
intreated him to let me be his ſecond but
could not obtaine it of him, we concluded
that it was neceſſary for him to have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the Princeſs and of the Counſell of
warr in the buſineſs; and we went firſt to
the Princeſs, to whom he declaring that his
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60972:60"/>
honour put him upon a duell with <hi>Liſimax,</hi>
ſhe before me could not forbear having
her ſelfe extremely troubled at it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
all that ſhe was able to turne him
from it. But when ſhe ſaw ſhe could not
pervail with him, Goe then, ſaid ſhe to
him, and fight this Giant, and heaven re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
for you the victory. From her we went
to the Governour, at whoſe houſe the
cheif officers being convened, <hi>Alcidor</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to them what he deſired and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
difficulty procured their leave to doe
as he thought good. From them I waited
upon him home; by the way whither, The
King, ſaid he to me, beleives <hi>Liſimax</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible,
and ſo doe others alſo; if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I overcome him I ſhall acquire a glory
which will not quickly dye: but if my ill
fortune on the other ſide will have him tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over me, this ſatisfaction I may
pretend to, that I am vanquiſht by one of the
braveſt Cavaleirs of our age. It is almoſt
impoſſible that you ſhould not conquer him,
replyed I to him, ſo much advantaged as
you are. Was there indeed nothing but the
favour of <hi>Floriſa</hi> that is enough to make you
irreſiſtable, and I make no doubt but the
prayers which ſhe ſends up for you will be
heared and draw down upon you the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:60972:60"/>
We were in theſe tearms when we
came to his lodgings; where he making me
ſtay and ſup with him, during ſupper I
againe ſet upon him with the beſt rhetorike
that I had to perſuade him to make me of
his party, but all to no effect. Riſen from
table we went into his cloſet, where he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
me a book to reade, I had not peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
many lines, before he had drawn theſe
and came and ſhewed them me.</p>

together with on aſſignement of the place
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60972:61"/>
where the two champions ſhould act their
parts and the two armyes ſtand ſpectators,
not without an aſſurance from the King, that
there ſhould on his ſide be no act of hoſtility
committed till all were returned to their
former quarters, he having pledged the
ſame in our name to the King, <hi>Alcidor</hi> had
apparent in his face the characters of a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
exultancy of ſpirit; the cheifs applyed
themſelves to take care about the marching
forth of the army the next morning, and
the Princeſs had a hundred times in an hour
day and night by turnes in her breaſt, what
with her hopes, what with her feares. But
he who gave her the occaſion of thoſe viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudes,
ſpending all his time with her,
brought her before he left her to a more
ſettled temper, and at parting received of
her together with her good wiſhes a very
rich ſcarf, imbroiderd with her name.</p>
            <p>The next morning in a ſuperb array
marched the army out of <hi>Paquin</hi> to the
place appointed, where the other alſo failed
not of rendring it ſelfe, <hi>Floriſa</hi> ſeated her
ſelfe in an eminent place where ſhe might
ſee the combate and be able by her regards to
animate <hi>Alcidor.</hi> All things in ſhort were
ready, and preſently appeared the two
competitors of honour. Before they came
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60972:62"/>
to their ſtations the King gave <hi>Liſimax</hi> his
ſword and repreſented to him that he had
an enemy who was both excellently skilfull
ad valiant. The Princeſs wiſht that ſhe had
had the liberty of doing ſome ſuch thing for
<hi>Alcidor,</hi> but ſhe could doe no more than
ſend him ſecretly by <hi>Placidas</hi> a bracelet of
her hair. After this, and that I had put my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the head of the cavalry of which
<hi>Alcidor</hi> was commander, with reſolution
either to dye or vanquiſh in caſe there ſhould
be any treachery (though this as it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
appeared needed not, there being
nothing attempted againſt the publike faith)
<hi>Liſimax</hi> and <hi>Alcidor</hi> choſe their judges,
took their places and the trumpets ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ran againſt one another with a ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
like that of a furious wind. Their ſucceſs
was very different; for <hi>Alcidor</hi> receiving
the lance of <hi>Liſimax</hi> in the bow of his
ſaddle ſo that it flew in peices, he with his
owne lance peirced his horſes ſhoulder
and belly, with his ſword cut in pieces his
bridle, and diſarmed him. Having thus
almoſt in a minute diſpatched the fight, not
without all the feilds and City ringing with
the ſhouts of our army and people that
were upon the walls, he ſent the ſword which
he took from his adverſary to the King
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60972:62"/>
who had given it him, and preſently both
the armyes retired, theirs to their ordinary
poſts, and ours into the Towne. Never
man of <hi>Alcidors</hi> condition received more
honour in a day than he did in this, by the
order of the magiſtrates bonfires for ſome
hours together lightened, and Canons
thundred in all parts of the City; no peice
of triumph was omitted that uſes to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
famous victories; the Grandees gave
him complements, and all ſorts of people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
which declared them moſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically
tranſported with what he had
done, and the replyes which he made to
them augmented their tranſports with their
elegancy and Generoſity. But all the reſt
was cheap to the price of thoſe congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
which he received from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;
they were as expreſſive of joy in her
ſelfe and of honour to him as her exuberant
ingeny prompted with her vehement affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
could dictate to her; and he in anſwer
to them attributed all his happineſs to the
prayers which ſhe had ſent to heaven for
him, and to the other favours that ſhe had
conferred upon him, and that with a rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricke,
modeſty, gallantry and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs
which gave her new occaſions of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling
and careſſing him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:60972:63"/>
This action of <hi>Alcidor</hi> coming to the
knowledge of <hi>Luſimon</hi> and <hi>Liſantus</hi> was
very differently received by them. <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
fearing it would prevail with his neice
to conſider him yet more advantageouſly
than ſhe did, vext him ſelfe at it with a moſt
diſingenuous cancetous malice, and ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of it upon all occaſions moſt detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctingly
himſelfe, cauſed others alſo to ſpread
reports of it altogether contrary to truth: but
it ſhon with a more triumphant ſplendor
than to be ſo obſcured. <hi>Liſantus</hi> on the
other ſide was himſelfe continually where
ever he came diſcourſing of it as of that
which he could not encomiaze enough, and
ſet his friends on worke alſo to proclaim to
the world its grandeur. What is it more,
ſaid he often, to have gained all than to
have vanquiſht <hi>Liſimax</hi> the moſt daringly
active man of his party.</p>
            <p>But while <hi>Alcidor</hi> had good ſucceſs in the
particular undertakings of his ſword, as alſo
in his loves (for he and <hi>Floriſa</hi> in deſpight
of <hi>Lucimons</hi> malignant intentions continued
to live in their accuſtomed intelligences. <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas</hi>
who had received his commands to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
them (favouring them as much as he
could), the general concernement of the
ſeige went on very ill on our ſide; the royall
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60972:63"/>
forces continually increaſt by freſh ſupplyes,
ours conſumed a pace by ſickneſs and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes,
and we were at length brought to ſuch
a paſs, that what becauſe we were for the
moſt part beaten, what to preſerve our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
wee durſt not ſtir out of the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of our bullwarkes. Scarcity of victualls
alſo grew upon us ſo that the people who
had before only groaned privately under
their ſufferings without daring to complain
publickely, now mutinied for bread and
rifled ſeverall houſes of the moſt noted Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes.
To lay this dangerous diſturbance
the Governor and thoſe others in power at
whoſe nodds the large but raſcall body of
the multitude was wont to move, fed
them with hopes of great things which <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidor</hi>
and I underſtood not. Among other
things they told them that if they would
have but a little patience, they ſhould
quickly ſee themſelves delivered from the
ſeige and all their other miſeries together,
and that there was but a moment almoſt to
wait for that fortunat event which would
render them completely happy. Preſently
after when <hi>Alcidor</hi> and I thought of nothing
but the meanes of reſiſting thoſe that begirt
us and dayly grew upon us, we at counſell
of war to our grand aſtoniſhment had
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60972:64"/>
newes brought us that the King was killed
with the ſtab of a knife. Struck with
horrour at this blacke paricide, we had it
redoubled at the exceſſes of joy with which
we ſaw firſt the aſſembly of Officers reſent
it, then moſt of the inhabitants of <hi>Paquin</hi> and
ſtrangers that defended it, reputing it a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
which the powers above had wrought
for their ſakes. But as well workt tempers
are never friends to baſeneſs, the Princeſs
in our preſence regretted this tragicke fall
of the ſupreme father of her countrey with

at which and at his ill uſage of her
upon his account, he had taken a ſevere
revenge upon him for it, had he not been
hindred by the high authority that guarded
him: he was how ſoever about to forſake
his party when <hi>Liſantus</hi> came to him and
refixt him to it by conjurations too ſtrong to
be broken through. <hi>Alcidor</hi> being pervailed

had a mind that I ſhould withdraw from
that pernicious revolt which I had too long
aſſiſted, I was by a dangerous ſickneſs
which I fell into conſtrained to quit both
<hi>Liſantus</hi> and <hi>Alcidor,</hi> and retire home,

which the company approving, after a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
brought in and ended they walkt
abroad. But before they had ſpent halfe an
houre in their walk there fell a great rain
which forced them to take covert, and there
they continued in various converſe till they
were called to ſupper. Supper done they
at <hi>Dorame</hi>'s requeſt returned to the place
where <hi>Vindorix</hi> had performed his part of
the ſtory, and there <hi>Rolimon</hi> having ſeated

with his part to this effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polianis</hi> juſtly irritated by the murder
committed on the ſacred perſon of his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigne
and brother-in-law <hi>Florimen</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
to take revenge of it or to periſh in
ſeeking it. Being alſo the next man of his
line, he reſolved to ſucceed him in the
throne or to be laid with him in the duſt in
attempting it. Carried by the intereſt of
which determinations from the ſeige of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi>
into the Province of <hi>Xanton</hi> and being,
to ſtop his progreſs, followed thither by
<hi>Lucimon,</hi> he marched up to him, defeated
his army and drove him to ſeek his ſafety
in a diſhonorable flight. Purſuing his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60972:65"/>
he drew up again to <hi>Paquin,</hi> took
the ſuburbs, gained other conqueſts and
advantages, and compelled <hi>Lucimon</hi> to run
before him as if he carried lighthing in his
hand to chaſtiſe him. In none of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunat
proceedings was <hi>Alcidor,</hi> for
though <hi>Lucimon</hi> earneſtly endeavoured to
have him with him, whither the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
to deſtroy him or the better to have an
eye upon his actions, he would never march
under his conduct, but gave himſelfe wholly
to <hi>Liſantus</hi> who being ingaged in as weighty
imployments as any other of his party had
himſelfe a particular army under him. But
the notable ſucceſſes of <hi>Polianis</hi> cauſing <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimon,

in which they far exceeded <hi>Polianis,</hi> ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
their courages, which the abundance of
blood ſpilt in the laſt celebrated battel had
drawn low, and carrying them to venture
another feild with him; it was in that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
day that <hi>Alcidor</hi> practiſed all the
offenſive and defenſive gallantries of war,
that he flew among the rankes, overturning
them, ſlaughtering them, breaking them
in peices like a ſwiftwinged thunder, that
he carried victory whither ſoever he carried
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60972:66"/>
his ſword. He indeed performed ſo much
both of the commander and ſouldior that
thoſe againſt whom he performed it with
a generall conſent cried out, At the blue
ſcarfe, (It was <hi>Floriſa</hi>'s kindeneſs which
dreſt him with that remark), on his being

piſtolls with him and laboured all that
he could to make him his priſoner, but he
was bravely ſuccoured by <hi>Liſantus.</hi> In
ſhort, I have heard a Cavaleir of his troop
ſay, who was in this occaſion mained for
the reſt of his life, that with ſome volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers

               </gap>ight he kept the fortune of the
day a great while in ballance. But having
had two brothers who fought by his ſide and
did, like him, things worthy of moſt laſting
monument for the uncommoneſs of them,
killed by it (the one of them carried his
bowells a long time in his hand, the other
when he was dropping from his horſe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
upon the enemy that he might die facing
them) and being ſet upon on all ſides, he
was at length filled with wounds which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him to be carried out of the battell. His
ill fortune was the whole armies of which
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60972:66"/>
he was, their efforts, as if they could not
fight without him, languiſht as ſoon as he
was gone, and there being no body that
fought with the aire of <hi>Alcidor</hi> but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtable
<hi>Liſantus, Polianis</hi> every where
traverſt the phalanxes and battalions with a
force which quickly compelled thoſe againſt
whom he imployed it to put their noſe in
the earth with a rout and loſs the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
that they ever before receaved.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Alcidor</hi> kept his bed of his
wounds ſome of his neighbours who were
his enemies having knowledge that he was
unable to ſtir, and that his brothers were
ſlain, brought to one of his houſes, lying a
dayes journey from <hi>Paquin, Indians</hi> that ſet
fire to it and burnt it. This malicious act
not having the power to trouble his great
minde ſo much but that within a few weekes
he was got perfectly well, as ſoon as he
was ſo, he watch fully obſerved the marches
of thoſe that had done it and within a few
dayes met with them as he deſired. Having
a troop of ſelect men with him he fell upon
them with a violence by which they who
were acquainted with the blowes of <hi>Liſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
and <hi>Alcidor</hi> might eaſily have gueſt him
to be one of them, againſt which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
thinking of nothing leſs than thoſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60972:67"/>
two renowned warriors, and only imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that they had to doe with a troop
who had met them by chance they at firſt
made a reſiſtance ſtout enough; but he lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up his viſour and naming himſelfe to
them, they immediately betook themſelves
to flight as their beſt defence. They fled
ſome one wayes ſome another with all the
ſpeed that a guilty conſcience and a feare of
puniſhment could give them: but he, from
whom they fled, and his company purſued
them every way with ſuch a ſwift and well
managed fury that they had in a moment or
two got them into their power. Which
done, could you think, you barbarous
people, cried he to them, that heaven
would leave unpuniſhed the outrage that
you have done me? or could you beileve
that I was ſo void of a ſoul as not to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of it, or ſuch a coward as not to ſeek you
out? ſaying ſo, he ordered a dozen of them
to be bound to trees, and cauſing fire and
ſtraw to be brought repreſented to them the
juſt reaſon that he had to burn them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall
of their burning of his houſe. There
being not one of them that did not ſentence
himſelfe as ſufficiently deſerving this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
they perpared themſelves to die:
but when they were ſurrendring themſelves
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60972:67"/>
to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lames, I content myſelfe, ſaid he
to them, cauſing them to be releaſed and
cutting ſome of their bands himſelfe, to
have made you affraid and given you to ſee
that it is in my hands to deprive you of life;
live and learne henceforward to doe well;
I give you your liberty to goe whither you
have a mind. Treated thus by him whom
they had uſed moſt unworthily they expreſt
to him a repentance of their offence which
baniſht all ill remembrance of it out of his
mind, they adored him as one of more
than humane goodneſs and ſuperſtitiouſly
enough to have raiſed temples and altars
to him if they had judged he would have
liked it, they went home with reſolutions
never to give blow againſt the party of
which he was, and after they had been a
little time there came and preſented to him
in reparation of the dammage that he had ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
by their meanes a conſiderable ſum
of money: but he would by no meanes be
brought to receive it, telling them that that
which he valued was their freindſhip and
not their coine. It is true though he refuſed
their ſilver, he could not but accept of other
preſents which they urged upon him of
horſes and armes.</p>
            <p>After this rendring himſelfe with <hi>Liſantus</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:60972:68"/>
who from the ſcatterings of the laſt feild had
gathered together a conſiderable body both
of horſe and foot, and ſeeking occaſions
of keeping his ſword in exerciſe, he one day
going abroad with only fifty Gentlemen
met two companies of Carabins of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
men apeice. At ſight of whom exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the courage of thoſe that were with
and finding it ſuch as he deſired, he ranged
them in two ſquadrons and having orderd
them to follow him ſlowly and when he
gave the ſignall to come up and charge, one
the one company and the other the other,
rode a little on before them. The enemy
ſeeing him, very advantageouſly horſt as
he was, come ſtraight up to them upon a
ſmall gallop, all at once made their ſalute
to him; and in return to it he and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
were in an inſtant upon them, gave
them a volley of ſhot with which many of
them tumbled, and falling in amidſt the
confuſion with an impetuoſity which is not
to be expreſt, quickly laid a great number
of them more upon the ground, and forced
the reſt, to yeild themſelves priſoners part
of them, part of them to fly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polianis</hi> in the interim, not blinding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with his proſperities, but preciſely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the motions of his enemies and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60972:68"/>
his affaires according to the beſt maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
and rules of prudence, when having
endeavoured to concile his people to his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement
by ſweetneſs, he ſaw himſelfe
forced by their obſtinacy to uſe ſteele and
blood, he laid ſeige anew to <hi>Paquin,</hi> not
without the inhabitants riſing in his cauſe,
nor without their being ſtilled and drawne
back from him by the Governor and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates.
For the better defence of it <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
would have had <hi>Alcidor</hi> put himſelf
again into it; but <hi>Floriſa</hi> was not there to
oblige him to doe ſo, and he had been too ill
uſed by that prince to obſerve his deſire. He
kept in the feild, where making continuall
courſes to and fro, he moleſted the Kings
forces more than any of his party. In par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
having gotten certain intelligence
that at ſuch a time there would be a broad
an important convoy of the enemy conſiſting
of three hundred horſe and as many Fantaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ns,
and which way they would paſs, he
put himſelfe with two hundred horſe in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcade
in a wood, and there attending till
they came, when he ſaw his time charged
the Cavalry with a fury which they were
not able to reſiſt but were routed, cut in

                  </gap>ilus,</hi> Lords whom <hi>Alcidor</hi> knew
and who were retiring from the Kings army
upon the account of ill health. To them he
reſtored their liberty and cauſed all their
equipage alſo to be returned, for which
they have ever ſince been of the number of
the beſt friends that he hath had in the
world. A great man who obſerved him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the fight leaning againſt a tree with his
armes ſhining with ſilver, with his ſword
in his hand bloody up to the hilt and with
the viſour of his cask put up and diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his face hath ſeverall times ſince ſaid,
that he could not imagine a more gracefull
ſight than he then appeared to him, or a
more perfect reſemblance of Mars taking
breath after a conqueſt. At this defeat of
his men the King was very much troubled,
but being of a diſpoſition that carried him to
commend brave actions he highly extolled
this of <hi>Alcidor</hi> and named him one of the
moſt gallant men of his ſide.</p>
            <p>The miſeries of <hi>Paquin</hi> being at length by
the preſſures of the ſeige grown to incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
extremities, all things ſeemed inclined
to put it into the hands of <hi>Polianis,</hi> and its
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60972:69"/>
grand, officers urged by the mutinous and
mournfull cryes of all ſorts of people and by
their own neceſſities, were treating with
him about a ſpeedy ſurrender when they
were incouraged ſo ſtand out a while longer
by intelligence which they had brought them
that <hi>Oſtravius</hi> was coming apace with a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
army to releive them; And they were
not diſappointed, for within a few dayes
the King drew of all his forces to go offer
that famed Captaine battel; but he would
not be drawn to venture ſuch a dangerous
caſt, thinking it enough to ſuccour the cheif
Town, and take ſome others and retire;
Nor was <hi>Polianis</hi> able either to force him to
doe the on, or to hinder him from doing
the other. Seeing which he fell to work
with ſeverall ſmall Towns and took them,
and ſome of great conſequence: he made
preparations alſo for invironing <hi>Xanton;</hi>
which when <hi>Oſtravius</hi> and <hi>Lucimon</hi> could no
longer doubt of, they commended that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall
of <hi>Paquin</hi> to the tuition of <hi>Liſantus</hi> and
<hi>Alcidor; Liſantus</hi> in quality of Governor
and <hi>Alcidor</hi> as his aſſiſtant, and they
diſcharged their truſt with ſtupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
performances: whatſoever honour
put them upon they failed not of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking

forced the army that begirt them to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
to a good diſtance from the walls,
and though they were afterwards brought
into great ſtraights for want of victualls they
notwithſtanding held it undauntedly out till
the aforeſaid princes came and compelled
the King to riſe from before them and leave
them at liberty.</p>
            <p>A while after the King, being infinitely
troubled that he could ſee no good end in
the proſpect which lay before him of his
people's obſtinacies and miſeries, to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it poſſible thoſe who had left them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be abuſed by the ſpecious pretexts
that were ſet up againſt him, and by that
meanes ſtifle that hidra of the rebellion
whoſe heads recruited as faſt as he lopt
them of, publiſht a declaration which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
very happily for a foundation of that
obedience which many of his ſubjects that
were in arms againſt him were preparing
for him in their minds. It particularly put
<hi>Liſantus</hi> and <hi>Alcidor</hi> upon conſidering and
weighing of things which they had before
very little or not at all thought of. But
being the principall ſprings by which the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60972:70"/>
Union moved, they thought it not noble to
leave in the lurch thoſe that depended upon
them, and who could not long ſubſiſt but
would be utterly undone without them.
They therefore kept on their way with their
wonted vigor, but <hi>Alcidor</hi> not with his
wonted ſucceſs. Whither Fortune had a

many of them that were met Commanders
of known courage and addreſs, there was
no body who did not chooſe rather to die

him ſay ever to ſee weightier blowes and
more manfull attaques and reſiſtances than
were than to be ſeen, and if one party
was ready to be Victor one moment the
other releived it ſelfe and was ready to give
the law the next. But in the end <hi>Alcidor</hi>
having done all that man could doe, he had
his horſe killed under him and was himſelfe

is rather, ſaid <hi>Melian,</hi> whether he hath
the power of refuſing her any thing, and

<hi>Alcidor</hi> is your Lover, would you have
me imagin that there will be a combat
between two perſons who have nothing
of quarrell. Let us not amuze ourſelves
in prognoſticating a miſcheif of which
there is no probability that it ſhould quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if at all, fall out, but let us think
of ſeeing <hi>Alcidor</hi> here at dinner; for my
part I have ſtrong hopes that we ſhall, for
I am ſure there is nothing of expedition
which he will not uſe when he knowes that
you deſire to ſee him. The night had not
ſhades ſo thick as to hinder him from tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing,
and beſides when he undertakes
any thing, he makes his way through all, nor
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60972:73"/>
woods, nor rocks nor pitchy darkeneſſes
are unpaſſable to him. I have practiſed him
enough to know him, and I ſpeak no more
than what I know to be true of him.</p>
            <p>To this <hi>Dorame</hi> was going to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
when they ſaw enter the coverd walk
where they ſat <hi>Limonides</hi> with a look
though not ſo overcaſt as when he brought
the newes of the death of <hi>Cartagenes,</hi> yet
very legibly inſcribed with ſomething of
ſadneſs. As ſoon as he came near them,
have you ſome new unhappineſs, preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him <hi>Rolimon,</hi> to informe us of that you
carry ſo melancholick a face? Have your
pains been unprofitable in ſeeking <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor?</hi>
or have you met with him, and ſome
ill hath befallen him? <hi>Almidon,</hi> Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<hi>Limonides</hi> to him, hath followed
<hi>Cartagenes; Alcidor</hi> hath made him pay at
the point of the ſword for the outrage
that he did him in reporting what was falſe
of him to <hi>Cartagenes.</hi> What <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ighting is here,

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rame</hi> ſighing? This is not the way
to let us quickly ſee <hi>Alcidor</hi> as we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.
This will not all retard his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
Madam, ſaid <hi>Limonides</hi> to her,
you will ſee him with you within an hour.
You tell me what will be enough to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
<hi>Limonides,</hi> ſaid ſhe in anſwer to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60972:74"/>
him, provided it proves true. There is
nothing in the world more true, Madam,
returned <hi>Limonides</hi> to her, than that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
it. I ſhal make no more queſtion of
it, replied <hi>Dorame</hi> to him, but tell us what
you know of his fighting with <hi>Almidon.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conducted, Madam, ſaid <hi>Limonides,</hi>
by <hi>Alcidors</hi> lacquey to the houſe of <hi>Meoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
(a freind of his) which is not far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from that, which was my Maſters
while he lived, nor from that alſo of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midon,</hi>
I there found him and delivered to
him your Letter; which when he had read
he told me there was no cure that I could
have brought him like that for the greif
with which he reſented my Maſters death.
Saying little elſe but that little, enough to
make me perceive that he had ſome buſineſs
which he was in haſt to diſpatch with
ſomebody, he jumpt on horſeback and
galloped away. To ſee whither he went I
followed him with as much ſpeed as I
could without being perceived by him;
but I was not able for ſome time to ſet eye
upon him. At length I diſcerned him
above a hundred paces from me with his
ſword in his hand againſt a man whom at
that diſtance I know not. Riding as hard as
I could to the place I had ſcarce diſcoverd
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60972:74"/>
his adverſary to be <hi>Almidon,</hi> but I ſaw him
run into the body by him and fall. When
<hi>Alcidor</hi> ſaw me by them, confeſs before
<hi>Limonides, Almidon,</hi> ſaid he, the wrong
that you have don me in reporting to his
Maſter thoſe things that were the occaſion
of his death. I can by no meanes excuſe,
returned <hi>Almidon</hi> to him, what you charge
me with, and therefore if I may ſay that I
forgive what is juſt, I forgive you the
wound which you have given me, and which
is apace letting out my ſoule. At theſe
words <hi>Alcidor</hi> dropping ſome teares upon
his misfortune as he had don upon my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
ſtopt his wound with his handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif,
ſet him upon his horſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed
him to the houſe from which we
came. There we ſaid, as <hi>Almidon</hi> deſired
us to ſay, and ſaid himſelfe that an enemy
who had met him by chance had given him
his hurt, and the Maſter of the houſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to inform himſelf of the name
of that enemy he would never tell him, but
deſired him to content himſelf with this
that he was a gallant man who had juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to ſet upon him, and that he died
ſatisfied with him, not knowing how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of his action which he was free and
valiant. He ſaid but little more and died
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60972:75"/>
in the armes of <hi>Alcidor,</hi> who, his eyes
being cloſed, commanded me back to you
with aſſurance that as ſoon as he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
order to have him caried home, he
would come away by the light of the moon
to render himſelf with you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Limonides</hi> having ſaid thus and holding
his tongue, It is indeed <hi>Alcidors</hi> happineſs,
ſaid <hi>Dorame,</hi> that thoſe whom he fights
with and kills die his freinds, but I am, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
that very much troubled at
theſe occurrences. That, ſaid <hi>Rolimon,</hi> is
the part of honeſt perſons that come to be
ſo unfortunat, and theſe incounters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
ſaid <hi>Vindorix,</hi> though they are to be
accounted good in regard that <hi>Alcidor</hi> hath
had the better in them, yet they are not ſo
in regard that two men, and one of them a
man of true gallantry, have in a privat
quarrell loſt their lifes by his hand. But
we ſhall have the leſs reaſon to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
provided <hi>Cloriaſtes</hi> increaſes not the
number of thoſe unfortunats: and we have
reaſon to hope that he will not, becauſe at
preſent he does not think that he hath any
occaſion of falling out with <hi>Alcidor,</hi> and
if he ſhould think ſo hereafter, he muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
think that to fight with him is not but
to augment his trophes. For one to have
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60972:75"/>
two ſuch combats one upon the heels of
another ſaid <hi>Melian,</hi> and in both to kill his
adverſaries without being at the coſt of a
drop of blood, does not uſually happen;
but it is to <hi>Alcidor</hi> that it hath happened
and that hinders it from being a wonder. A
great reaſon of his good ſucceſs, ſaid <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rame,</hi>
ſurely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is becauſe he drew not his
ſword but upon a juſt cauſe; for who can
deny but he had right on his ſide in both
theſe duells, in the one as being aſſaulted,
in the other as being outraged. No man,
Cozen, ſaid <hi>Rolimon</hi> to her, can with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
condemn him for what he hath don
and if any man ſhould have either ſo much
malice or ſo little judgment as to ſpeak ill of
him for it, he would finde enough ready to
revenge it upon him. But let us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
hence to wait for him in the houſe,
as ſhady as this place is the rayes of the
ſun peircing it, and beginning to ſet it on
fire.</p>
            <p>Removed into the houſe, they for ſome
time held converſation upon ſeverall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
things which <hi>Cartagenes</hi> had done, and
then <hi>Dorame</hi> turned it to <hi>Floriſa</hi> and <hi>Alcidor,</hi>
ſpeaking very much in commendation of the
former for regarding the merit rather than
the birth of the latter, though reſerving
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60972:76"/>
the quality of Prince, ſhe knew he was
iſſued of one of the beſt families of the
kingdom and of him they were ſpeaking
when he came into the room where they
were. At the ſight of one another he and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rame</hi>
were ſtruck into a little ſtupor, which
being quickly diſſipated and ſalutations per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
you have ſince you left us, Sir,
ſaid ſhe to him, been to us the cauſe and
the object of more than ordinary apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;
my Uncle and Cozens who came
hither two dayes ſince have been both wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
and partners of them; but was there
a neceſſity that you ſhould abuſe us by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſhadow to us of going to agree ſome
freinds and engaging yourſelf in mortall
quarrells? I hope, Madam, interrupted
her <hi>Alcidor, Limonides</hi> hath not done me
the ill office to conceal what paſt between
his Maſter and me? He hath given us a full
account of it, Sir, ſaid <hi>Rolimon</hi> to him,
but my neice taking a particular intereſt in
your preſervation, therefore ſets thus upon
you, that ſhe may perſuade you not to
be another time ſo ready to ſatisfie the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments
of men void of reaſon. What
could I do leſs, replied <hi>Alcidor,</hi> than
uſe my ſword againſt a man who forced me
ſo to defend me honor and my life. I am
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60972:76"/>
certainely no quarreller, much leſs am I of
a humor to fall foul upon thoſe whom I
do not beleeve to have a deſign of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
me, but that it ſhould be ſaid that out
of cowardiſe I diſengaged myſelf from a
provocation, or that any body ſhould ſet
upon me without my giving them to ſee, as
far as I am able, that I am not inſenſible,
I can by no meanes bring myſelf to endure.
You gave ſufficient demonſtration of this to
<hi>Liſimax,</hi> ſaid <hi>Dorame</hi> to him, and thereby
acquired a far more triumphing reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than that any body ſhould be eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed
to paſs ſentence upon you as puſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous.
I ſee you know, Madam, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Alcidor</hi> to her, what in reſpect of its
in conſiderableneſs I had reaſon to think lay
private from you; but that is too ſmall a
thing to procure me credit with any body,
much leſs can it bring me into eſteem with
you to whom thoſe things are common
which to others are rare. Not to diſſemble
what we have done, Sir, ſaid <hi>Rolimon</hi> to
him, <hi>Vindorix</hi> and I to divert my neice have
imparted to her the knowledge which we
have of your life, which reaches, you know,
to the time that you was taken priſoner, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
what became of <hi>Floriſa</hi> and what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe
you maintained with her, after her
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60972:77"/>
Uncle removed her from <hi>Paquin.</hi> I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
replied <hi>Alcidor,</hi> that ſhe hath had no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a diverſion, the occurrences of War
uſually making horror rather than harmony
to thoſe of her ſexe and temper. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
my weaker ſexe, reparted <hi>Darame,</hi>
I am not of ſo weake a temper, as to be
frighted with the bruite of things; on the
contrary they have been very melodious
aires to me, both thoſe of your martiall deeds
and thoſe of your amorous intelligences
whith the princeſs <hi>Floriſa.</hi> In the remainder
of which latter I beſeech you to inſtruct me,
after you have recounted to us, that which
I alſo begge of you, how things went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
you and <hi>Almidon.</hi> But yet before
you doe this I will ſhew you what <hi>Cartage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
wrot to me dying. With thoſe words
ſhe took out of her pocket and preſented to
him the letter of that defunct, which he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
read. How few ſuch men, ſaid he,
are there to be found in the world, and how
much regret have I that ſuch a man ſhould
fall by my ſword, though withall by his
own fault. But let us leave him in peace
Madam, continued he, and ſuffer me to
tell you that you uſe me with too much ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
to intreat of me what it is your
part to command. Had you as much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60972:77"/>
for me as I have honor and obedience
for you, you would only ſay, <hi>Alcidor,</hi> it
is my will you ſhould do thus and thus;
this freeneſs would make me do what you
deſire with greater cheerfullneſs. But you
beleive you ſhould render me too happy
ſhould you treat me ſo. You have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſurely to complain, anſwered ſhe to
him, if I pay you the reſpect which I know
to be due to you: looſe no more time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in producing to us theſe punctilio's of
your ſpirit, we being better aſſured of its
excellency than to need ſuch teſtimonies of
it, but relate to us the adventure, which you
have had with <hi>Almidon.</hi> Not to tell you
again what you have been told allready,
Madam, ſaid <hi>Alcidor</hi> to her, be pleaſed to
take this breviate of the reſt.</p>
            <p>After I was informed by <hi>Cartagenes</hi> and
<hi>Limonides,</hi> how <hi>Almidon</hi> had calumniated
me to the former, and by ſo doing been the
author of his misfortune (over which I
could not chooſe but weep) I had no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
any thing beſides my love of your ſelf ſo
buſy in my minde as revenge; but I was a
while unreſolved of what means I ſhould
ſerve myſelf in proſecution of it; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
I thought of acting one way, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
another: I was indeed moſt inclined
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60972:78"/>
to go find him myſelf in his houſe, and
draw him into the feild, there to demand
an account of him for what he had done;
but I was withall miſerably agitated with
fears of incurring your diſpleaſure by ſo
doing, and of acquiring the tittle of a gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
more than of your ſervant. I had
agreed thoſe upon whoſe occaſion I went
hence with the ſucceſs that I deſired, and
there was nothing but my love that ſtood in
the way of my anger. But when I conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that you was of a more generous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
than to take it ill that I ſhould ſeek
ſatisfaction for the wrong that was done to
me and for the miſcheife that was done to
<hi>Cartagenes,</hi> I wavered no longer but leaving
that dying man in the armes and to the care
of <hi>Limonides,</hi> I betook myſelf to the houſe
of <hi>Meonimus</hi> from which that of <hi>Almidon</hi>
was not far diſtant. Where having ſtaid
ſome hours to repoſe my ſelfe and write
that letter to you which you was pleaſed
moſt obligingly to anſwer, I got again on
horſebacke, and leaving behinde me my
freind's houſe was quickly at that of my
enemie. I found him at home, was recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by him better than I deſired, and ſoon
underſtood from him that he knew nothing
of the death of <hi>Cartagenes</hi> (for I reckoned
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60972:78"/>
him to be by that time no more among the
living) and that he beleived I knew nothing
of the reports which he had made to him
concerning me. Hiding therefore my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments
from him, after I had ſtaid with
him neer an houre, and refuſed the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of eating which he very civilly preſt
me with, I acted ſo that I engaged him to
ride out with me. When we were come
far enough from his houſe, in the midſt of
a wood, whither I ſerved myſelf of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of a great roade to bring us, taking
him by the hand and obliging him to make a
halt as I did, <hi>Almidon,</hi> ſaid I to him, I
know not where to find a place more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to require an account of the injury that
you have done me than this. Amaz'd at
which words without giving me leaſure to
proceed, what is it, <hi>Alcidor,</hi> ſaid he,
which moves you thus to ſurprize me? I
never had a minde ſaid I to him again, to
ſurprize any man unhandſomely; but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that you have not freeneſs enough to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
willingly thoſe whom you have wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I have choſe to draw you clan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ularly
hither that ſo you might not be able to find
any way of eſcaping or giving yourſelf a
diſpenſation from fighting. But tell me then,
returned he to me, what the injury is which
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60972:79"/>
you accuſe me of having done you, and for
which you thus ſet upon me. Do you not
remember, replied I to him, or can you
deny that you not long ſince ſpoke of me to
<hi>Cartagenes</hi> otherwiſe than was true and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt?
who, anſwered he, hath told you that
I did? <hi>Cartagenes</hi> himſelf, reparted I. He
hath indeed allwayes told me, returned he,
that he would ingage me in a quarrell with
ſomebody, and I have now too much experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of it to queſtion that he was in earneſt.
But I will maintain to him that he lyes and
that I never ſpoke of you but as I ought. At
thoſe words provokt with his baſeneſs in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
what I was ſure he was guilty of, and
laying the blame upon one of whoſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
I had ſufficient proofe, I took my
ſword in my hand againſt him; but he made
no offer of putting himſelf in a poſture of
defence. Seeing which, are you ſo great a
coward, cried I to him, as not only to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay
what you have broached, but alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
fighting with one who defies you to it
and will kill you if you do not reſiſt him?
But theſe reproaches ſtirred him not and I
was unwilling to ſtrike a man who would
not defend himſelf. To try therefore if I
could bege<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> a courage in him, and withall
the better to convict him, I repeated to him
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60972:79"/>
the words which he had ſaid to <hi>Cartagenes.</hi>
Struck with which and his owne conſcience
together he ſat on his horſe like a ſtatue as
if he had had nothing of ſenſe or motion left
him. At length recovering ſpirit, <hi>Carta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi>
ſaid he, hath been moſt diſingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
unjuſt to fixe upon me what I never
thought of, and I ſhall act powerfully
enough againſt him to let you quickly ſee
his artifice and baſeneſs, and that I am no
ſuch baſe or cowardly perſon as you accuſe
me to bee. <hi>Cartagenes</hi> no longer lives, cried
I to him, this ſword which I hold in my hand
to puniſh you hath forced him to make a
voyage into another world for having too
lightly given credit to your diſcourſes. That
unhappy Cavaleir was as valiant to attacque
me as you are heartleſs to defend yourſelf;
but the equity of my cauſe ſurmounted the
injuſtice of his, and you, Impoſtor ſhall,
if I can make you, run the ſame adventure,
expiating your crime with your blood. Take
your ſword therefore in your hand or I will
run you through. But theſe words warned
him no more than the former, and could he
have fled I dare confidently ſay he would
not have ſtaied long in the place. In ſine,
when after I had with a great deal of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
waited upon him he ſaw I would wait
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60972:80"/>
no longer but was reſolved to uſe him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to his ignominy unleſs he would ſtand
upon his guard, he told me that his ſword
was not equall to mine, as indeed it was
not, being as bad a one as I have commonly
ſeen, and that if I would ſtay till the next
morning he would render himſelf where I
ſhould appoint to give me the ſatisfaction
that I deſired. As commonly they who have
an ill paymaſter their debtor are content to
be paid with ſuch money as they can receive,
I conſented to his procraſtination and we
concluded upon a place and hour where
and when to meet the following day. Which
being come, about halfe an houre before <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides</hi>
came to me, I ſaw enter the houſe
of <hi>Meonimus</hi> one whom though diſguiſed I
knew to be <hi>Almidons</hi> lacquey. The faſhion
in which I ſaw him, and the manner in which
he inquired for <hi>Meonimus,</hi> whom I had ſent
from home in the morning upon other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that ſo I might have leaſure to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
that which I had in hand with <hi>Almi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
made me ſuſpect that his Maſter was
brewing ſomething of treachery. To aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
myſelf of the truth of it, and know
what this diſguiſe meant, I took the lacquey
by the collar, and ſhewing my ſelf moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
angry threatned him to make him
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60972:80"/>
hang if he would not quickly tell me why he
was metamorphoſt, and for what reaſon he
came into the houſe covertly and like a
theife. Preſently the poor boy who had
his ſenſes frozen with feare confeſt to me
that his Maſter had given him a ſumme of
money to advertiſe <hi>Meonimus</hi> ſecretly of the
Duel which he was to perform with me,
and to feigne that it was his owne proper
motion to give him the advertiſement. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
then of the lacquey where his Maſter
was, and hearing that he was gone to the
place aſſigned for our meeting I thought of
nothing any more but to make haſte to him.
But <hi>Limonides</hi> arrived at the inſtant with
your moſt wellcome letter, and I ſtaid to
read it twice over and to ſpeak a few
words to him that brought it. Which done
to come upon <hi>Almido<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
               </hi> unawares, I galloped
to him by a private way. Perceiving him
wholly aſtoniſht to ſee me inſtead of <hi>Meoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
whom he expected, I gave him leaſure
to recollect himſelf, and then I with much
difficulty made him draw his ſword; But he
uſed it ſo ill that I with little difficulty gave
him a wound which let out the beſt part of
his blood upon the place. The reſt <hi>Limo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi>
I ſuppoſe hath acquainted you with, I
ſhall therefore only add that I have not
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60972:81"/>
without a very great diſpleaſure to me been
compelled in this faſhion to make good my
honor againſt a gallant man and a coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
He having ſaid ſo, the action of the
former of them, ſaid <hi>Dorame,</hi> does indeed
afford a ſubject of praiſe, that of the latter
carries infamy in its remembrance. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more certain, adjoined <hi>Vindorix,</hi>
than that a mans good or bad reputation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
for the moſt part upon his actions.
Some more words they had upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and <hi>Alcidor</hi> fell into particularities with
<hi>Dorame;</hi> in which the other company being
about to leave them, the table preſently

I am ſure too much cauſe to complain of

put my ſelf in that of <hi>Liſantus,</hi> and there
I paſt ſome time without learning any news
of the princeſs though I had continually ſpies
about <hi>Lucimon</hi> to diſcover in what place of

Love appearing without hopes of proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the War every moment furniſhing
me with new means of laying both them
and the melancholy which they cauſed to me
aſleep, I began after ſome months to think
no otherwiſe of the Princeſs than as of one
who was wholly loſt to me. Among theſe

            <p>Seriouſly affected with theſe lines when I
conſiderd that a page had had the faithfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
wit and courage to deceive the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs's
guards, I could not but reckon my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
obliged to practiſe all poſſible means of
ſeeing her. Sending therefore <hi>Alexis</hi> before
to advertiſe her that I would be ſuddenly at
her feet, but that ſhe and <hi>Leonora</hi> muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
their knowledge of me, with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
Troop whom I durſt truſt and whom, in
that confidence whichI had in them, I inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to call me by another name, I took the
way withall ſhe ſpeed that I could after him.
Coming to the place about, twilight I askt to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60972:82"/>
ſpeak with <hi>Doliban</hi> the Captaine that guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the princeſs; who preſently appearing I
told him that <hi>Liſantus</hi> having received ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
of a deſign that was on foot of taking
away the Princeſs, had ſent me to impede
the execution of it. Taking what I told him
for certain, he received me with a great
deal of freeneſs, ſhewed me what ſouldiers
he had and what order he obſerved for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
his fair charge and deſired me to
do what I judged in the preſent occaſion
fitting. Accordingly to confirm him in his
beleife of what I had affirmed, I appointed
ſentinells to be ſet at all the avenues of the
place, and concerned my ſelf to ſee that and
ſeverall other things done with as much
zeal as if I had really been affraid of the
rape that I pretended, and with as much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
as if I expected it would have been
preſently attempted. All this while I diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verd
nothing to him of the deſire that I had
to ſee the Princeſs, but as ſoon as we had
ſettled things for her ſafety, he of his own
accord offerd me to conduct me to her, I
took the offer and went along with him like
one ſufficiently diſintereſted, and ſhe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
me as coldly. When <hi>Doliban</hi> indeed
with longer eulogies of me than either ſhe or
I at that time cared for, told her what rank I
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60972:83"/>
held with <hi>Liſantus</hi> and upon what errand
I was come from him, ſhe payd me thoſe
reſpects which in common manners were
due, but yet ſhe in every thing acted her
part ſo ſagely that one would have firmely
beleived ſhe had not had the leaſt acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with me. <hi>Leonora</hi> alſo gave authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to the diſſimulation by the curioſity which
ſhe ſhewed in inquiring after my name and
ſeverall other things about me. But <hi>Doliban</hi>
being after a while called away, we quickly
changed the faſhion of your converſe. We
recounted, ſhe to me the ſeverities which her
Uncle <hi>Lucimon</hi> had exerciſed upon her ſince
he had removed her from <hi>Paquin,</hi> I to her
the pains that I had taken to learn her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode,
both I to her and ſhe to me how bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our forcible ſeparation had been to us,
and how ſweet our preſent ſtoln inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
was; we deliberated of the means
of keeping <hi>Doliban</hi> blind and of ſeeing one
another for the future; we diſcourſt of all
that we could think of paſt, preſent and to
come that concerned either our good or our
ill, we determined that for prevention of
diſcovery and to keep of ſuſpicion it was
neceſſary that as I had come after the ſun
was gone down ſo I ſhould be gone before
it was gotten up: In breife the moſt of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60972:83"/>
leaſure that we had we ſpent in reciproca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
teſtimonies of affection to one another
the moſt emphaticall that her vertue and my
reſpectfullneſs could allow us. But this kept
us not from being ſo wary that when <hi>Doli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi>
returned to me, he found me exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
whither all things were in good order at
the inlets. In which work he bearing me
company, I took occaſion to remonſtrate to
him that it was neceſſary the plot ſhould be
kept ſecret from every body and particularly
from <hi>Lucimon</hi> for fear it ſhould alarum
him ſo as to diſturb him in the great affairs
which he had upon his hands. It is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
added I, that the enemie's deſign
is known to <hi>Liſantus,</hi> your ſelf and me,
our forces and cares being of validity enough
to ruine it; only let it be your buſineſs to
watch ſolicitouſly for the ſecurity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of your charge, and it ſhall be mine
to give as I am obliged a very fair character
of you to him that ſent me. To this <hi>Doliban</hi>
ſhaped a reply full of honeſty and civility,
and carried me backe to the Princeſs; who
ſignifying ſome apprehenſions of the danger
that ſhe was in we aſſured her that provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they in the Town had, as there was no
reaſon to queſtion but they had, reſolution
and fidelity anſwerable to their duty, ſhe was
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60972:84"/>
as ſafe where ſhe was as ſhe could be any
where elſe of the Kingdome. I had by this
time not above halfe an houre to ſtay, and
<hi>Doliban</hi> as opportunely as if on purpoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding,
we improoved it as we were taught
by our Maſter Love. He reentring when
we were drawing to a concluſion my tongue
inſenſibly ſlided to commend her to his tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and to take my leave of them both. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the Campe I found that <hi>Liſantus</hi>
had ſent all about in ſearch of me; preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
my ſelf therefore to him though he with
a ſtrict curioſity examined where I had been,
I deceived him as well as I had done <hi>Doli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi>
diſguiſing things ſo to him that he had
not the leaſt ſuſpicion of the truth.</p>
            <p>By ſuch means during a month that we
ſtaied in the province of <hi>Sancy</hi> I ſeaven or
eight times ſtole the ſight and company of
<hi>Floriſa;</hi> after which the motions of the
War carrying us elſe whither we bad one
another adieu with tears on her part which
ſhe told me ſprang from ſtrong apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that ſhe ſhould never ſee me again, and
with proteſtations on my part that how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
ſoever the Countrey was whither I
went I would not with the bleſſing of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
be long before I viſited her. But <hi>Polia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>
never ſuffering us to reſt, but continually
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60972:84"/>
ſhewing himſelf either at our heels or <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimon</hi>'s,
ſo that all the diligence that we
could uſe was too little to protect ourſelves
againſt him, I was much longer than I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
before I could make good my word.
He indeed by the victories which he obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
over us weakened us ſo much that I had
more reaſon to conſider how to prevent the
ruine of myſelf and my party than how to
carry on my loves with <hi>Floriſa.</hi> Not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe
any of the traverſes of the War (for
with them I ſuppoſe you are allready ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted)
every moment that I would have
gone to find the Princeſs, new imployments
were laid in my way by <hi>Liſantus</hi> whom I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
my ſelf bound in honour to obſerve.
But I was nothwithſtanding all obſtructions

of <hi>Suchieu</hi> were fallen into mutinies,
to remedy the diſcorder thought fit that I
ſhould make a voiage thither. Having by
which means in a ſhort time obtained an

and quickly at my journie's end. All
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60972:86"/>
tumults ceaſing at my arrivall. After I had
reſettled things in their former conſtitutions,
I enquired of the officers of the Town what
condition the Princeſs was in and what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was obſerved in guarding her, and they
not only informed me in what I askt, but
they alſo conducted me to her and left me
with her; that which <hi>Anaximenes</hi> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that had the Cuſtody of her, though
it was wholly againſt the command which
<hi>Lucimon</hi> had given him, was ſo far from
oppoſing, that buſying himſelf about ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his charge which required his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
care, he gave us ſufficient leaſure of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
one another. We had indeed not
only that firſt day, but alſo during foure dayes
that I ſtaid at <hi>Suchieu</hi> as much liberty with
one another as before that <hi>Lucimon</hi> was jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of it, and I made as frequent and as free

Siſter with very ſharpe reproaches. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement
hereof ſhe ſent me by <hi>Alexis;</hi>
whereupon, though ſhe aſſured me withall
that not brother, not Uncle, not all who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhould either by fair or foul
means be ever able to divorce her heart
from me, I nevertheleſs with cloſe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
thoughts repreſented to my ſelf that
her quality, beauty, wiſedom, vertue ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
her an equall match to the poſſeſſor
of a throne, for me to aſpire to the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of her was to go about to debaſe her
from her juſt height, to be guilty of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance
of which the fruite would be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
envy if it ſucceeded, if it ſucceded not
publique deriſion; and to pull upon me from
her relations a loade of malice under which
I muſt neceſſarily fall. From theſe and ſuch
like premiſes I drew a concluſion to beware
for the future how I nouriſht an affection of
which nothing could in all likelihood come
but unhappineſs. But write this concluſion
to her in relation to whom I made it I durſt
not; I only ſent her word by <hi>Alexis</hi> that
ſince her brother diſliked that pious fire with
which I offered my heart in ſacrifice to her,
I would for ſome time hide it under the

reſerve, would not fail of ſeeing her if it was

eminency of reputation, I had at firſt no
other ſenſe of, than as of a fall, the diſgrace
and dammage of which was very hardly if
at all to be repaired; but it afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of very profitable conſequence to me.
<hi>Polianis</hi> tooke notice and care of me as of
ſome body conſiderable, he appointed me
no other jayle but his court, no other jaylor
but my parole, he gave me a thouſand rich
experiences of his goodneſs, he earneſtly
preſt me to ingage in his ſervice, and I ſhould
without doubt have done myſelf the good
office of ſatisfying him, had he been of the
ſame religion with me. That he was not
was the argument that I uſed to him for my
diſpenſation, and he took it not ill; only
when by far better fortune than merit I was
demanded to be releaſed in exchange for
three, the meaneſt of whom was of much
more value than <hi>Alcidor,</hi> he obliged me to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60972:88"/>
promiſe him that I would change my ſide
when he changed his faith.</p>
            <p>While I lay priſoner at the Court I was
told by ſeverall of credit that <hi>Floriſa</hi> was
erelong to be married to <hi>Eridan,</hi> prince of
the royall Blood. Whereupon, what I had
before carried by rote, I confirmed by decree
that I would conſider her no more as my
moſt adorable miſtreſs but only as my illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
freind. But though I was fully bent
to retire from her bonds, I notwithſtanding
went to waite upon her as ſoon as I was at
liberty, and in our converſe I uſed all the
skill that I was Maſter of to veile my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from her. But we had not been long
together before ſhe told me that ſhe after
my long abſence obſerved a conſtraint and
alteration in me which was very ſtrange to
her. I endeavouring to make her looſe that
opinion, and particularly excuſing my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
by my impriſonment and upon that
occaſion ſpeaking honourably, and as I was
in gratitude bound, of <hi>Polianis,</hi> ſhe rejoined
that ſhe was affraid the favours and vertues
of that victorious prince had overcome me
ſo as to make me at once abandon the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
of her family and grow cold in the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which I had vowed to her. To this I
was ſhaping an anſwer with which I hoped
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60972:88"/>
to ſatisfie her, but was prevented by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of <hi>Dorilas,</hi> which gave me no more
leaſure than to ſlip away without ſo much
as bidding her Adieu, and I had no more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of ſeeing her before that her ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious
brother carried her away to a place
where ſhe was more ſtraightly guarded than
ever.</p>
            <p>At length the King after he had ſeriouſly
deliberated of the concernements of religion
making a turne which pleaſed ſome, diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
others, brought over to him the moſt
remarkeable Lords of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Union, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Lucimon</hi> allmoſt deſperate, with a moſt
propitious condeſcenſion challanged me of
the promiſe which I made him when I left
his priſon, and I readyly followed whither
the loadſtone of his authority and goodneſs
drew me, not without the honour of having
the incomparable <hi>Liſantus</hi> to beare me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
Him he preſently made vice Roy of
a province of <hi>China,</hi> to me he gave twenty
thouſand Takes in preſent to repair the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
that I had been at in maintaining the
War againſt him, and foure thouſand Takes
in penſion, cauſing me withall to be ſaluted
by <hi>Feonice</hi> the ruling object of his affections
and by her Siſter <hi>Aſtaſia</hi> a principall beauty
of his court.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:60972:89"/>
Theſe things were not done with ſo little
noiſe but that they reached the eares of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſa,</hi>
and as <hi>Alexis</hi> brought me word ſhe
fell ſicke with the hot alarum which ſhe
took at them. By him therefore I wrot
back to her that ſhe ought not to take it ill
that I had quitted a party whom I at length
had found to be moſt unjuſtly and diſloyally
armed againſt their Soveraigne, or that the
danger which I ſaw and ſhe knew I was
every moment in by the ill will of her rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
had made me think a little of acting as
my preſervation demanded of me, and that
as long as I lived ſhe ſhould have cauſe to
beleeve that I had for her a juſt veneration,
a thankfull memory, and a faithfull ſervice.</p>
            <p>It followed by ſome intervalls, and I
have done when I have told you it, that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantus</hi>
and I were ſet on work by the King to
help to deſtroy that monſter (for ſo we now
reckoned the Union) which we had ſo long
aſſiſted, and that we very proſperouſly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheived
our task, that <hi>Dorilas</hi> ſeeing no

<hi>Lucimon,</hi> and having no mind to ruine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with him askt the King's pardon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it, that <hi>Polianis</hi> juſtly incenſt againſt

with a penitent humility ſaught his grace and
ſubmitted to his Scepter, that by this meanes
a generall peace was reſtored to <hi>China,</hi> and in

me and <hi>Floriſa,</hi> which had been all this while
dying but had made ſeverall efforts to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

before the going out of the Candle, was by
the end of the War wholly extinct.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alcidor</hi> having brought his narration to a
period, and the Company having paid him
their thanks, I have been informed, ſaid
<hi>Dorame</hi> to him, that your love did not die
when it left <hi>Floriſa,</hi> but only like a Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
ſoul paſt from one to another, from <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſa</hi>
to <hi>Aſtaſia,</hi> I ſhall therefore account myſelf
very much in your debt if you will relate to
us what were the tranſactions of it with that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60972:90"/>
beautifull wife of <hi>Certafilan.</hi> There are
many reaſons, Madam, returned <hi>Alcidor,</hi>
which forbid me doing what you deſire.
But the moſt remarkable of the truths
which you would know, one of my freinds,
deſigning ſo to oblige me, hath faithfully
enough penned down. This manuſcript
if you think it worth your time to examine,
I ſhall willingly put into your hands. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he pulled out of his pocket and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to her a little book of which the cover
was <hi>Crimſon</hi> velvet embroidered with Gold
and adorned with Pearls and Cyphers. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
took it, vewed its outſide, opened it,
found the pourtraitures of <hi>Alcidor</hi> and <hi>Aſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi>
on the firſt and ſecond pages, and lookt
awhile upon them, ſhe gave it to <hi>Melian</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
him to read it to them, and he read
it in theſe words.</p>
            <div type="story">
               <head>The Hiſtory of the Loves of Alcidor
and Aſtaſia.</head>
               <p>ALcidor being returned to <hi>Paquin</hi> from
<hi>Canton</hi> where he had ſubdued the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
of the confederacy, now that the
fires of the civill War were wellnigh all
quenched, had a fire kindled in his breaſt
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60972:90"/>
by the beauties of <hi>Aſtaſia</hi> which was of too
much force eaſily to be put out: And yet he
had at firſt conſidering her known integrity
to her husband no in couragement to hope
that it would ſucceed to his ſatisfaction. But
on a ſudden as if ſome fatality had laboured
to cleere his way, <hi>Certafilan</hi> with his nice and
diſtemperd palate began to diſtaſt the viſits
which the more gallant Courtiers made to
his Lady. This folly prevailing with more
and more unrulineſs in his ſpirit he at length
never ſaw any body near her but he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it was to corrupt her caſtity; Nor
though to obey and pleaſe him (ſeeing
what diſeaſe he laboured under) ſhe ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
all the Company which ſhe thought he
might ſuſpect, grew he ever the more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
but ſo interpreted all her actions to his
fanſie that there was not the leaſt and moſt
ſpotleſs of them with which he found not
fault. Wholly governed with which fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy
he retrenched the uſage of thoſe reſpects
which he had been wont to pay her and moſt
unworthily loaded her with abuſes which it
was impoſſible for her long to bear. She
notwithſtanding practiſed all the ſweet
meanes that her diſcretion was able to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt
to her to put him in a better mind; but
inſtead of being thereby brought back to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60972:91"/>
reaſon he was exaſperated higher and grew
more and more inſupportable. Her teares
which one would have thought able to melt
cruelty it ſelf rather increaſt than allaied
his rage and her juſt complaints ſerved to no
better effect than to make him vomit a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
contumelies againſt her honor. Nor
were her own indeavors to appeaſe him
fruitleſs only but the Kings alſo, who having
knowledge of his madneſs uſed what reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
he judged requiſite for his cure, but
without effecting it. During this ferall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of <hi>Aſtaſia, Alcidor</hi> went every day
to ſee her without her perſecutor being able
to hinder it, it being in the lodgings of <hi>Feo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
and in the preſence of <hi>Polianis</hi> that he
viſited her; and as often as he ſaw her he
made her ſee that he was as deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in her ſufferings as ſhe was herſelf.
She again every day drunke in ſuch a ſenſe
both of his ſympathy and accompliſhments
as with the aſſiſtance of <hi>Certafilan</hi>'s outrages
rendred this latter leſs and leſs and that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
more and more agreeable to her. He
proceded to manage time and his actions
ſo advantageouſly to his purpoſe that ſhe no
longer regarded him but as one regards thoſe
whom one ſincerely likes. She was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
but when he was with her, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60972:91"/>
but when he was from her. She
felt emotions and attempts which ſhe had
never felt before; by which diſcerning that
Love was ſurprizing her heart ſhe imploied
all her ſtrength to defend it, but he not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all made himſelf Maſter of it.
Perceiving herſelf conquered, ſince thou
findeſt it in vaine, ſaid ſhe to her ſelfe, to
oppoſe the will of Love, of whom all the
world holds in fee, rebell no more <hi>Aſtaſia.</hi>
Who can with common charity blame thee,
becauſe thou ſubmitteſt to a puiſſance which
diſpoſes of all as it liſts, and becauſe thy
affections lacquey no longer after a Maſter
who hath moſt barbarouſly handled them,
but run to one whoſe qualities are all irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtably
magneticke, and who, if any body,
is moſt likely to protect and releeve thee?
who indeed if not <hi>Alcidor</hi> is able to bring
<hi>Certafilan</hi> into order. But, alas, by what
meanes ſhould he do it? for him to ſpeak
to him in my defence what is it but to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
his jealouſy? And though it may be
he dares not aſſault him, may he not ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
himſelf upon me, a woman who have
nothing but ſighs and teares for my armes
againſt him? But imagine, <hi>Aſtaſia,</hi> that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidor</hi>
is able to ſupercede his oppreſſion of
me, who hath told thee that he will be at
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60972:92"/>
the paines to go about it? The reſpects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
which he renders thee ſeem to be ſuch
as would aſſure thee of it, but conſider he
renders the like to all Ladies, and had he a
particular kindneſs for thee he would not
ſurely have been untill this houre to let thee
know it, every thing having favoured ſuch
a deſign. No, no it is impoſſible that a
great fire ſhould lye ſo long under its cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
without appearing more or leſs; It
would therefore be a great vanity in thee to
perſwade thyſelf there is any ſuch in his
breaſt for the. The Princeſs <hi>Floriſa</hi> indeed
hath too much empire in her attractions to
ſuffer him to ſubject himſelf to any other.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Aſtaſia</hi> was diſcourſing thus with
herſelfe about <hi>Alcidor,</hi> he was at the ſame
time reſolving with himſelft to declare to
her his paſſion, and conſidering that he had
not liberty to do it by word of mouth by
reaſon that <hi>Certafilan</hi> had eyes and eares
every where to watch her, he concluded to
make a letter his proxie. Accordingly he
without any farther demurre drew his
thoughts on paper, ſealed it up and made
himſelf his meſſenger to carry it to her. He
found her in her Siſter <hi>Feonice's</hi> Chamber,
ſhe being newly come in to it, out of her
cloſet where ſhe had been ſome while ſhut
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60972:92"/>
up bemoaning her ſelf, but <hi>Certafilan</hi> follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
him in at the heels, and when they
could have wiſht him in the remoteſt part of
the world debarred them by his Company
from having any particular ſociety. He kept
his eyes ſuch ſtrict ſentinells upon them both
that they could hardly ſteal a few glances
one of another, much leſs could they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
one another as they deſired. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a while as if on purpoſe to dreſs a party
againſt him, <hi>Feonice</hi> ſet upon him with ſo
hot a charge for his untowardneſs to her
Siſter, that he could intend nothing but how
to defend himſelf againſt her. Obſerving
which opportunity <hi>Alcidor</hi> offerd his letter
to the hand of <hi>Aſtaſia,</hi> and ſhe civilly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it ſlipt it into her pocket. <hi>Feonice</hi>
ſtill held <hi>Certafilan</hi> to task with her remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances
of his fault, and ſhe was ſo earneſt
in them and thought them ſo equitable that,
though <hi>Aſtaſia</hi> made frequent ſignes to her to
deſiſt, ſhe would not be taken off till the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall
having ſpent all the weak excuſes
which he could forge, ſaid nothing more but
what made her hope he intended to be better
for the future, though as it afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
he at the ſame time reſolved to be
worſe, with a very ſkillfull diſſimulation
laying a conſtraint upon his humor to hide
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60972:93"/>
his deſign. Hardly had <hi>Feonice</hi> ſat down from
her action but <hi>Polianis</hi> came into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
whereupon <hi>Certafilan</hi> fearing a ſevere
reprehenſion from him alſo made haſt away,
nor was he ſtopt by the King who had at that
time other thoughts in his mind. <hi>Certafilan</hi>
gone, his Lady pretending herſelf not well
withdrew into her Chamber; <hi>Alcidor</hi> offerd
to lead her, but ſhe civilly refuſed it, and he
preſt it not gueſſing ſhe went to read what
he had given her. And he gueſt right; for
having walkt three or four turnes in her
Chamber among her women ſhe went into
her Cloſet, and having ſhut herſelf in
opened the letter and read in it theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>

The King when ſhe reentred was in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
converſation with that abſolute Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
of his heart, and he went on in it. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidor</hi>
was at ſome diſtance veiwing pictures
in which art had ſo dextrouſly imitated na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that things dead ſeemed alive and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible:

above the imitation of art, with
wit, beauty and goodneſs, and taking the
opportunity went and confirmed to her by
words of his Letter. She gave him for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
what ſhe had written, which having
read ina corner where the King and <hi>Feonice</hi>
could not ſee him he with a thred of grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
reſpectfull and affectionate language
tied her heart to him in a moſt faſt knot.
She owning as much to him, they procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to contract their affections one to the

conſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60972:94"/>
if ſhe would go along with <hi>Feonice</hi> to the
waters. To this your Majeſtyes deſires,
returned ſhe, and my Siſters Company are
of much more value to me than that I ſhould
be backward either to obey the one or follow
the other, provided that he to whoſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
I am ſubject will grant me a licence. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive
me, <hi>Aſtaſia,</hi> replied the King, if that
untoward man ſhall hereafter go about any
thing againſt my will I ſhall limit him ſo that
he ſhall not be able to act but by the rule of
my pleaſure. There cannot indeed be found
Sir, ſaid ſhe againe to him, an expedient
more proper to ſtill his tyranny than to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to it an auguſt power as is that of your
Majeſty. <hi>Certafilan</hi> ſurely, inſerted <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi>
will not be ſo raſh as to reſiſt his Prince,
who he knows reigns by juſtice and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
together, and when he ſhall find that
injuring his Ladies vertue he enterprizes
upon his ſoveraigne's authority that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
her protection I do not doubt but he
will out of a ſenſe of his equity and for fear
of his anger make his ſuſpicions die. We
will wait to ſee what he will do now, ſaid
<hi>Polianis,</hi> and if he does well, I ſhall as he
deſerves cheriſh him, if ill, puniſh him.
In the mean while, <hi>Aſtaſia,</hi> prepare for
the journey with your Siſter, I ſhall be very
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60972:95"/>
much pleaſed that you accompany her, and
I cannot believe that your husband can be
troubled at it, when he ſhall know that I
am ſo pleaſed. Thoſe that are ill temperd
as he, Sir, ſaid <hi>Feonice,</hi> take occaſion as
well to ſpeak againſt the wills of Kings,
which are regulated by ſober and diſcerning
reaſon, as of common people who act not
but according to the dictates of brutiſh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
without being able to diſtinguiſh what
is good from what is bad. But I perſwade
myſelf, ſaid <hi>Alcidor,</hi> that <hi>Certafilan</hi> will
hereafter governe his motions with ſo much
prudence that his Majeſty will not be put
to any trouble to reforme them.</p>
               <p>They thus diſcourſing for a while toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then the King reſuming a particular
conference with <hi>Feonice,</hi> and by favour of
that occaſion <hi>Alcidor</hi> doing the like with her
Siſter, <hi>Certafilan</hi> in the mean time, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
rackt himſelf, feares that the Letter
was reſolving his wife to practiſes againſt
him, and to augment his inquietudes he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
that if he went preſently to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
them the King would (not without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
offended) diſcover the diſeaſe with
which his ſpirit laboured, if he waited till
the King was gone that <hi>Alcidor</hi> would in the
intervall bring his wife to his will. Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60972:95"/>
about in this perplexity he met two
Magiſtrates, freinds of his, who according
to the order that they had received were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to wait upon the King at <hi>Feonice</hi>'s Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings:
Them he went a long with thither,
without ſhewing any thing of his trouble,
and before the King and his Company ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
in a gaineſs of temper which gave
them thoughts of him very different from
what they had lately had; <hi>Polianis</hi> deſiring of
him that his wife might the day following
beare her Siſter Company to the Waters he
expreſt a free and cheerefull conſent; he
diſcourſt with <hi>Alcidor</hi> as if he had had no
other fanſy of him but as of his deareſt freind;
he ſhewed to <hi>Aſtaſia</hi> as kind regards as
when they were firſt married. And theſe
he continued to her not only while the King
was preſent (who after he had beene a little
in private with <hi>Feonice</hi> bad her and her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
fare well. <hi>Alcidor</hi> doing the like and
attending upon him) but alſo till ſhe went
away, which ſhe did the next morning, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a ſplendid equipage provided by him
for her journey.</p>
               <p>About ſixe dayes after the two Siſters were
come to the Waters, <hi>Aſtaſia</hi> fell ſtrangely
ſad without being able to give any reaſon
why ſhe was ſo. While ſhe was dominee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60972:96"/>
by which humor, and <hi>Feonice</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to aſſwage it, word was brought
her that a lacquey deſired to ſpeak with
her. She commanding him to be brought to
her with hopes to find him <hi>Alcidor</hi>'s, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared

know thy pernicious baſeneſs and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſs

that thou ſhouldſt thus unworthily treat

ſhe, not only to beleive <hi>Floras,</hi> but at what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
rate to deliver yourſelf from <hi>Certafi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.</hi>
I now ſee, reſumed <hi>Aſtaſia,</hi> that the
melancholy with which I have been oppreſt,
but of which I could not tell you the reaſon
was an augury of the evills which this in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
brewes againſt me, and indeed we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
have ſadneſſes, which though we know
not the ground nor meaning of, are omens of
misfortunes which too nearely (though dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely)
hang over our head. But there is a
remedy for thoſe that are prepared for you,
ſaid <hi>Feonice; Floras</hi> hath befreinded you
with the meanes of avoiding them; Let us
therefore retire into your Cloſet, there to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60972:97"/>
contrive your ſafety. Entered there <hi>Aſtaſia</hi>
fell onweeping as if ſhe had had an intention
to drown her life in her Teares: but her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
at length prevailing with her to dry her
eyes to conſider of what ſhe had to do, I
think it requiſite, ſaid ſhe to her, that you
ſhould firſt of all make anſwer to <hi>Floras,</hi> and
then when we have diſmiſt his man, we
will ſend advertiſement to the King of <hi>Certa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filans</hi>
purpoſes. You know the compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
nobleneſs of his ſpirit, and what an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
he is to ſuch as are treacherous. You
neede not therefore doubt but he will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſtrain if not puniſh the wickedneſs of
that wild beaſt your Husband. I cannot but
acknowledge, returned <hi>Aſtaſia</hi> to her, that
<hi>Polianis</hi> is the moſt excellent Monarch in the
world, and that he intereſts himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alſo in the concernements of my fortune
becauſe I am your Siſter. But will not this
be to be allwayes a priſoner to ſtay with
them whom he ſhall appoint to hinder <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tafilan</hi>
from impriſoning me? I have a ſecret
which I muſt no longer conceal from you,
<hi>Alcidor</hi> loves me, and that (if I do not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
by being over-credelous) in ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
that there is nothing of difficulty which
can affright him or will hold him back from

If you are certaine of <hi>Alcidors</hi> affection,
replied <hi>Feonice,</hi> you need not be affraid of
<hi>Certafilans</hi> cruelty: but what evidences have
you of it and ſince when was it born? ſee
the teſtimonies, returned <hi>Aſtaſia,</hi> giving
her <hi>Alcidors</hi> Letter, after which I think I
cannot lawfully call his love in queſtion: ſee
alſo the returne which I have made to it, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſhe, giving her a copy of her anſwer to
him. <hi>Feonice</hi> having peruſed them, <hi>Aſtaſia</hi>
made a relation to her of what had paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, which done, conſidering all,
ſaid <hi>Feonice,</hi> I no longer doubt that <hi>Alcidor</hi>
loves you and therefore I no longer appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
that your condition is deſperate. And
as to your love of him a woman barbarouſly
handled as you have been by one bound to
uſe you with all imaginable ſweeteneſs as is
<hi>Certafilan,</hi> cannot be blamed for ſeeking are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
againſt that barbariſme. One allwayes
lookes with pitty upon thoſe women who do
nothing that may ſeem diſhonorable but what
abſolute neceſſity conſtraines them to, and
though it be a moſt reproacheable buſineſs
to deceive a good husband, it is, if an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
a very pardonable one, to free ones
ſelf from the perſecution of a bad one. I
reckon indeed, replied <hi>Aſtaſia,</hi> that if in

the reall fault will be his who by his intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

he to himſelf, got into my power ſuch an
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60972:99"/>
opportunity as I have often wiſht for of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Aſtaſia</hi> ſee, that I place my happineſs
in ſerving her, that I prize my own life leſs
than her liberty, and that having love for my
Commander there is nothing too hard for
me (to attempt at leaſt if not) to break
through in her Quarrell. Conſidering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
proceeded he, that nothing is more
prejudiciall to buſineſs of moment than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſeneſs,
and that <hi>Feonice</hi> being of our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
will render <hi>Polianis</hi> alſo of it, let us make
haſte to her who with ſo much ſweetneſs and
earneſtneſs calls us. What he ſaid he made
good, mounting preſently on horsback with
halfe a ſcore men in whom he had confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and arriving with the two Siſters juſt
when they were preparing for bed, not
without filling them with aſtoniſhment at his
diligence and contentment at his preſence.
You are come, Sir, ſaid <hi>Feonice</hi> to him,
(while <hi>Aſtaſia</hi> recollected her ſcattered ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,)
to ſuccor my Siſter againſt her Husband
who goes about to murder her with affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
I very much reſent my ſelf your deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
for it, and poſſibly I ſhall not be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
but I ſhall have the power one day of
giving you proof of my reſentment together
with her. I have, Madam, replied <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>
to her, nor power, nor courage nor
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60972:99"/>
freinds nor intereſt which I will not gladly
imploy in the ſervice of your Siſter who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
no leſs at the hands of all that know
her. But the buſineſs being of action bare
words are unprofitable as which ought to
have effects for their warrant. What there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is there requiſite to be done, Madam,
for this Lady whom I ſee wholly ſeized
with the apprehenſion which ſhe hath of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into the hands of her enemy. It is with
the pleaſure which I have with ſeeing you,
ſaid ſhe preſently to him, that I am thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſied,
and by that and by the liberty and
confidence with which I have ſummoned
you to my aſſiſtance you my eaſyly judge in
what eſteem you are with me. If we are
by common humanity, Madam, returned
<hi>Alcidor</hi> to her, bound to ſuccor thoſe whom
we know not, as we without queſtion are,
it is a farr greater tye which I have upon me
to do all that lies in my power for you who
are the ſoul of my ſoul, and if I think not
too fondly of myſelf, that zeal which I have
for your ſecurity will, when you have told
me what you judge ſitting to be done for it,
impower me to do it ſo happyly that I make
no doubt but you ſhall ſoon ſee <hi>Certafilan</hi>'s
purpoſes converted into ſmoke. <hi>Alcidor,</hi>
replied <hi>Aſtaſia</hi> to him, who knowes all the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60972:100"/>
arts of War, who hath been uſed to break
ſquadrons and force Towns, who found out
plenty of ſtratagems to ſupport the league,
cannot ſurely want an expedient to deliver
<hi>Aſtaſia</hi> from <hi>Certafilan.</hi> I depended upon
your contrivance as well as execution. Say
therefore what courſe you judge in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
convenient to beſteered. Only firſt,
adjoined ſhe, giving him the letter of <hi>Floras,</hi>
reade the information which hath been ſent
me of my condition. <hi>Alcidor</hi> having read the
letter a conſulation was held, of which the
reſult was that <hi>Aſtaſia</hi> ſhould put herſelf in a
pages habit that ſo, as <hi>Alcidor</hi> told her, ſhe
who was worthy to command the greateſt
Kings of the earth might in that garbe of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude
avoide the danger of being known,
and under that diſguiſe, the covert of the
night and <hi>Alcidors</hi> conduct retire to a
freinds houſe, there to lye hid till the
King having notice of what was intended
againſt her ſhould, as they made no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
but he would, take order for her ſafety.
Accordingly <hi>Alcidor</hi> preſenting to her a
page's habit which he had for the purpoſe
brought with him, ſhe dreſt herſelf in it, and
in this dreſs her beauty was ſo far from lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
any of its power that love who perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the cheif part in this act took advantage
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60972:100"/>
by it to ſtrike the Cavaleir anew, and he
ſtrucke him with ſo much force that he ſtood
gazing upon her without being able to ſpeak
a word. <hi>Feonice</hi> taking notice of it, if he from
whom you are to defend my Siſter meets
you, Sir, ſaid ſhe to him, and you turn
as voide of ſenſe then as you appear now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I
may lay any wager that ſhe is loſt and am
ſure to winne. But aſtoniſh your ſelf no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſee her unhappineſs compell her thus
to habit her ſelf. If you was capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking,
Madam, replied <hi>Alcidor</hi> to her
that which Love makes me take notice of in
this faire Queene of his Empire you would
have your ſpeech and judgment left you
as little it may be as I have had. <hi>Certafilan</hi>
himſelf could not with all the hard and
feirce thoughts that he hath for her conſider
her in this poſture but he would have ſome
mild and tender ones mixt with them. This
is but to trifle and make ſport with my miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
and we have at preſent ſomething elſe
to minde ſaid <hi>Aſtaſia,</hi> and therewith fell on
weeping, and <hi>Feonice</hi> together with her. But
<hi>Alcidor</hi> to take them of from that ſad exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
obliged them to bid one another fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
led <hi>Aſtaſia</hi> to her horſe, helpt her up

               <p>The Summer ſeaſon and the light of the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60972:101"/>
Moon making it pleaſant travailing <hi>Alcidor</hi>
renderd it more pleaſant to <hi>Astaſia</hi> by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
her with very taking diſcourſes,
and to himſelf by conſidering her feminine
graces in her maſculine habit. One thing
which they both pleaſed themſelves with

               <p>

informing them what the buſineſs was, they

be much more blameable than ſhe is, had ſhe
not ſo much cauſe to complain of you as ſhe
hath, and <hi>Alcidor</hi> would be far more cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
than he is, if you had not given him
a very ſpecious pretext with which to excuſe
himſelf. Not that I approve enormous
actions: time will ſhew you that I very
well know to correct and curbe the raſhneſs
of thoſe who enterprize more than they
ought in my dominion, where I would have
not vice but vertue bear ſway: I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of good reaſon, Sir, ſaid <hi>Certafilan,</hi>
where with to purge myſelf of the fault with
which you charge me. I freely confeſs I am
in a high degree guilty both of diſreſpect to
your Majeſty and of inhumanity to <hi>Aſtaſia:</hi>
when I diſobeyed you, I had loſt my reaſon,
when I treated her ill, I was madde, and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60972:103"/>
when I armed myſelf and my freinds to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtroy
<hi>Alcidor,</hi> my trouble made me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
my duty and think of nothing but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
Pardon me, Sir, for what is paſt,
and for what is to come, I ſhall ſo change
my temper that neither your Majeſty ſhall
have occaſion to reprove me for my capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and franticke carriage towards <hi>Aſtaſia,</hi>
nor <hi>Feonice</hi> for my furious humor. But to
give proof of what I ſay, where is now <hi>Aſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia?</hi>
She is raviſht from me, Sit, and it is
from your juſtice that I wait for reparation
of the injury. If <hi>Aſtaſia, Certafilan,</hi> ſaid
the King to him, hath cauſed herſelf to be
carried away, it is not to ruine either her
own honor or yours; her vertue forbids
any thing bad to be ſuſpected of her, and
you well know ſhe hath not gone away but
to warrant herſelf from the afflictions which
ſhe apprehended you would lay upon her
afreſh. Retire therefore without any diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and leave me to manage her return
and the whole affair; I will labour both
for your contentment and of all that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Certafilan</hi> in obedience to what the King

would turn as much to his benefit.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Certafilan</hi> was thus growing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
from his jealouſy, though ſhe who had
been the object of it little thought of his
change, yet having reached her retreat in
which ſhe ſaw ſhe was out of danger of the
tormenting effects of that his raging humor,
knowing alſo that ſhe had in <hi>Feonice</hi> a better
ſecond with the King than that ſhe needed
fear his anger, experimenting beſides in the
company of <hi>Alcidor</hi> the difference between
kind reſpects and barbarous indignities ſhe
relaxed her mind, tied up as it had been to a
diet of ſorrow, to feed at large upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
<hi>Alcidor</hi> alſo made much of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which he had of her ſociety and congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
himſelf in it as a moſt bleſt man. But
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60972:104"/>
yet amidſt theſe inchanting ſweetneſſes they
both of them had ſo much conſideration that
<hi>Alcidor</hi> by <hi>Aſtaſia</hi>'s approbation left her the
next morning and went to the King to give
him an account of what they had done.
Which being performed, and the King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
read the letter of <hi>Floras</hi> to <hi>Aſtaſia,</hi> it is
by this, ſaid he to <hi>Alcidor</hi> holding it in his
hand, what we ſhall ſtill the complaints of
<hi>Certafilan,</hi> who yeſterday demanded ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of me againſt you. I ſuppoſe <hi>Floras</hi>
will not want the courage to maintain to his
face that not being able to execute what
he deſired without an odious baſeneſs he
thought himſelf bound by the Laws of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
to give notice of it to her againſt
whom it was intended. I will therefore in
your juſtification ſend for him and ingage
him publickly to own himſelf the author of
what you have been the agent. Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
replied <hi>Alcidor,</hi> will (I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion)
bring the affaire to ſuch an issue that
the vertue of <hi>Aſtaſia,</hi> the honeſty of <hi>Floras</hi>
and my fidelity ſhall lie under no ill name.
He had ſcarce ſaid ſo when <hi>Floras</hi> came into
the Chamber, whom the King as ſoon as he
ſaw him asking what brought him thither ſo
early he anſwerd, the ſervice that he owed
his Majeſty. But how, ſaid the King, can I
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60972:104"/>
beleive them my ſervants who league them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with <hi>Certafilan</hi> to carry on his tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
over his wife altogether contrary to my
will. If your Majeſty, returned <hi>Floras,</hi>
will be pleaſed to let my ſpeak for my ſelf
I make no queſtion but I ſhall ſo fully clear
my innocence in that which you accuſe me
of; that you will deigne me inſtead of your
disfavor your approbation. Trouble not
yourſelf <hi>Floras,</hi> replied the King, you may
by this ſee (therewith he ſhewed him his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to <hi>Aſtaſia</hi>) that my accuſation of you is
only feined. But it is requiſite that you
maintain before me to the face of <hi>Certafi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi>
that he deſired you to be confederate and
executioner of that deteſtable peice of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
upon his wife of carrying her to the
place which he intended to make her jayle,
and that having a horror of it you, as you
thought yourſelf in honor bound, diſcovered
the contrivance to her. Your Majeſty, ſaid
<hi>Floras,</hi> requires no more of me than what
truth, common equity and my own credit
render my duty, and what I am therefore
ready with all my heart to do. <hi>Certafilan</hi>
will not, I am ſure, deny that the evening
before his wife went with her Siſter to the
Waters carrying me into your Majeſty's
garden he there told me that he was reſolved
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60972:105"/>
to ſhut her up and keep her in Cloſe impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment
all her life, diſcoverd to me the
plott that he had laid to effect it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
me to be the Conductor of it, that
which I promiſed him to be though at the
ſame time I determined the contrary. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him ſay ſo, the King ſent a page for <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tafilan;</hi>
who preſently coming allmoſt out
of breath with haſte, oh <hi>Certafilan,</hi> ſaid the
King to him, here is <hi>Alcidor</hi> now againſt
whom you yeſterday demanded juſtice of
me; tell me therefore if you are in the ſame
mind to day. The offence that he had done
me, Sir, replied <hi>Certaiflan,</hi> is greater by
much than that unleſs I am unſenſible I
ſhould eaſily forget it or paſs it by. To this
<hi>Alcidor</hi> having his mouth open to repart, If
you think, <hi>Certafilan,</hi> ſaid the King, that
in having delivered <hi>Aſtaſia</hi> from your ugly
and unſufferable oppreſſion <hi>Alcidor</hi> hath
committed a great offence, you muſt ſeek
elſe where to have him puniſht than of me,
and perſwade me to chaſtiſe myſelf. It was
indeed by my order that he conveighd away
your wife whom I knew <hi>Floras</hi> who is here
preſent was by your order to carry away, to
make her miſerable all her life. I would
not yeſterday tell you this becauſe I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
that you would of yourſelf confeſs
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60972:105"/>
your fault; but finding you ſtill in the mind
to perſiſt in it, I would have you know that
Kings have intelligences which their people
have not. Hear <hi>Floras</hi> ſpeak againſt you,
he is a wittneſs whom you cannot refuſe.
Preſently <hi>Floras</hi> offering to convict him,
ſee, <hi>Certafilan,</hi> proceeded the King, the
Letter which hath diſcoverd your conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and obliged me to take into my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
the deare Siſter of <hi>Feonice,</hi> and give
<hi>Alcidor</hi> command to carry her away. <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tafilan</hi>
having read the Letter with the name
of <hi>Floras</hi> to it, Juſt heavens, cried he,
what means you have to take vengeance on
the wicked, cauſing them to be detected by
by the ſame perſons whom they would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
partiſans of their wickedneſs. I ſee, Sir,
added he, that he who I expected would
have favoured my enterprize, hath accuſed
me of it: but I am ſo far from taking it ill at
his hands that he hath uſed me thus, that I
very much eſteem him for it, knowing that
he hath herein been a true freind as well to
my happineſs as to his own honor. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
repent, renounce my bruitiſhneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Aſtaſia,</hi> and I will no more be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
with that madneſs which hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
made me continually ſee things other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than they have really been. Hearing
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60972:106"/>
him in this ſtrain, mens hearts, ſaid <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anis,</hi>
do ſometimes change on a ſudden, but
that <hi>Certafilan</hi> whom all my Court have for
his uſage of his wife reckoned not much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than a ſalvage beaſt ſhould in a moment
become humane and tractable is a wonder
which will very hardly gain beleif. I ſhall
nothwithſtanding take your word and I ſhall
indeavor alſo to bring your wife to do the
ſame and to make you freinds. For a
prologue to which reconciliation between
you and her, I muſt at preſent have one made
between you and <hi>Alcidor;</hi> oppoſe my will,
neither of you. I am ready, Sir, ſaid <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi>
to give <hi>Certafilan</hi> teſtimony that I have
a ſerious deſire to ſerve him. And I, ſaid
<hi>Certafilan,</hi> am ready to make it appear that
I cordially honor <hi>Alcidor.</hi> Many more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of amity uſed <hi>Certafilan</hi> to <hi>Alcidor,</hi>
and <hi>Alcidor</hi> to <hi>Certafilan;</hi> many alſo uſed
<hi>Certafilan</hi> and <hi>Floras</hi> to one another. In the
interim of which laſt, the King drawing
<hi>Alcidor</hi> aſide askt him, if it was not advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeable
that <hi>Aſtaſia</hi> ſhould be preſently
brought back to <hi>Certafilan.</hi> To this, that he
might impede the union which he feared
would impede his loves, your Majeſty, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
he, may undertake whatſoever you
think good, and I acknowledge one cannot
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60972:106"/>
do better than rejoin theſe divided ſpirits,
but I withall know that <hi>Certafilan</hi>'s acted and
intended inhumanities have ſo irritated his
Lady againſt him that ſhe can ſcarce endure
to hear his name; much leſs will ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
quickly to returne to his perſon. His
brutall unkindeneſs hath newly forced her
to ſeek her ſafety in running away from him,
it cannot be therefore expected that ſhe
ſhould ſuddenly truſt herſelf again with
him. For if ſhe is of a ſweet diſpoſition ſhe
is alſo ſenſible of abuſes. There is reaſon,
<hi>Alcidor,</hi> ſaid the King, in what you ſay:
It is indeed neceſſary both that he ſhould
undergo pennance for what he hath done,
and that ſhe ſhould receive ſatisfaction for
what ſhe had ſufferd. He ſhall not therefore
come near her till he hath appeaſed her. But
that he may have no occaſion of ſpeaking or
thinking ill of her abſence and that all Kings
may go according to decency, I would have
her leave the place where ſhe is, and put
herſelf with the Religious of whom your
Kinſwoman is the ſuperiour.</p>
               <p>The King, who though he had a ſharp
ingeny to peirce into the myſteries of love
perceived nothing of <hi>Alcidor</hi>'s towards <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſia,</hi>
having thus concluded with him about
the diſpoſing of her as if he had had a mind
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60972:107"/>
to furniſh him with meanes of ſeeing her
without exception. Her husband coming to
him, your Majeſty, ſaid he, I hope que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
not my reſolution of relapſing no more
into my old diſeaſe; permit me therefore I
beſeech you to have before my eyes her
whom I have moſt unjuſtly tormented but
without whom I cannot now live but in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
myſelf. Conſidering the animoſities
which you have raiſed in her, returned the
King to him, and the condition into which
you have driven her, it would be plain
folly to imagin that ſhe ſhould be eaſily
bent and retrived to your will. She is not
retired from the world to be willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
ſo ſoon again with men, eſpecially
with him who hath given her ſuch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of diſtruſting him as you have done.
My Counſell therefore to you is that ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her to live with her regret for a time
among that vertuous troop whither ſhe
hath withdrawn herſelf you let her know
your repentance by letters, and by promiſing
her a uſage to come as kind as what is paſt
hath been harſh, you endeavor to make her
loſe that grudge with which her ſtomach
boiles againſt you. This I beleive to be the
beſt expedient that you can uſe to reſtore
you with her, and I will withall deſire <hi>Feonice</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:60972:107"/>
as ſoon as ſhe returnes to advance your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
the quicklieſt that ſhe can. That
I muſt not preſently have her company, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Certafilan,</hi> is an infelicity which I
know not how to undergo; but I ſhall, all
that I am able, inforce myſelf to be patient
under it, knowing myſelf to be the cauſe
of it, and I will draw from my afflicted
heart the moſt moving and effectuall lines
that I can to procure my peace with her. I
would have no other but <hi>Floras</hi> deliver them
to her, ſaid the King, for the ſight of him
will I beleive be very acceptable to her,
ſince it was by his means that ſhe knew and
diſappointed your intentions of immuring
her. <hi>Floras</hi> ſpeaking himſelf very deſirous
of the ſervice <hi>Certafilan</hi> preſently took him
to his Chamber and there wrot this letter
before him.</p>

a joy which overflowed the banks of her

as ſoon as ſhe had opportunity declared

them firſt to the King, then to him to whom
they were directed, with the ſcheme in
which he repreſented to him all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his Lady at the ſame time, whetted
his deſires of recovering her company and
workt him without any peeviſhneſs to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

from him. The King, <hi>Certafilan</hi> carrying
the Letter to him, after he had read it the

what <hi>Floras</hi> had ſaid to him and by the

abſolutely convinced him that for her to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
herſelf for a while from him was no

more than what ſhe owed to her innocence
and to her repoſe, and that for him after he

to returne to him before ſhe thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
was to perſiſt in his mercileſs perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution

ſoliciting the King, <hi>Feonice, Floras</hi>
and <hi>Alcidor</hi> to be the charitable authors of
procuring and haſtening it, and the three
former were ſerious in advancing what he
ſued for; <hi>Alcidor</hi> alſo made ſhews of favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it as much as any, but having liberty
where ſhe was of ſeeing her every day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſturbance, he clancularly ſet all the

her returne to <hi>Certafilan</hi> for a month without

ſo much as the ſcene where they were acted.
But at length the King making oath to that

he would within eight dayes bring her back

and then to her, that to keep the Kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60972:110"/>
to perſerve her honor and happineſs,
and dextrouſly to conduct the caball of their

with him to whom the Laws had tied
her and whoſe remorſes called her back to

deſired made Oath to to her, that his carriage
towards her for the time to come ſhould be
a perfect recantation of what was paſt and
an unblotted Coppy of all the offices of love.
He having by theſe and other unqueſtionable
teſtimonies of his reformation obliged her
to be reconceiled to him, and ſhe having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60972:110"/>
that ſhe was willing to be ſo, The
King put her into his hands with a moſt bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
exhortation to him to be as good as his
word. Which done, and he having kiſt her
with a kind of adoration before <hi>Polianis,</hi> he
carried her to a houſe which he had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for her reception, and there the next
day banqueted <hi>Feonice Alcidor</hi> and <hi>Floras</hi>
with a moſt magnificent kindeneſs.</p>
               <p>He in the ſequcle of this never ſtirred
from her, but was continually paying her
the reſpects not only of a fond husband but
of a ſuperſtitious votary, and after a while
that he might enjoy her beloved ſociety at
quiet he with her conſent carried her into
the Countrey and there fettled their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This change of their abode is belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to have put an end to the loves between
<hi>Aſtaſia</hi> and <hi>Alcidor,</hi> in her abſence another
Lady taking poſſeſſion of his heart: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of this no clear knowledge I chooſe to
ſpeak of it not at all rather than not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Melian</hi> having done reading and reſigned
the book, and the Company having thankt
<hi>Alcidor</hi> for the uſe of it, <hi>Alcidor,</hi> ſaid <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rame,</hi>
would be yet more obliging, if he
would recount to us thoſe his following loves
which the writer ſayes he was not well
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60972:111"/>
enough acquainted with. You will it may
be, replied <hi>Alcidor</hi> when you have heard
all, name me a very inconſtant man; but
there is nothing in the world beſides your
diſaffection which I would not cheerfully
undertake or undergo to ſatisfy you. I am
therefore ready to do that which you deſire.
To this <hi>Dorame</hi> making no other anſwer but
by diſpoſing herſelf to an attention he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctly
related what had paſt between him
and <hi>Carmelia,</hi> what alſo between him and
<hi>Felisbea,</hi> carefully reſerving whatſoever
might ſeem to knock againſt the honor of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them.</p>
               <p>His narrative concluded, you cannot
think, ſaid <hi>Dorame</hi> to him, that <hi>Felisbea</hi> died
for any thing elſe but for your neglects, and I
cannot but wonder that her beauty being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
taking, her ſpirit accompliſht and her
quality honourable you would not think of
marrying her. I acknowledge, returned <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidor</hi>
to her, that the birth and perfections
of that young Lady were ſuch as challenged
for her a husband of a far higher forme
than <hi>Alcidor;</hi> but there are certain fatali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which rule the courſe of our lifes, ſo
that we act not but according to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions.
What was the cauſe of <hi>Felibea</hi>'s
death I know not, but the reaſon why I was
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60972:111"/>
not in love with her without doubt was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
my deſtiny reſerved me to be in love
with the incomparable <hi>Dorame.</hi> It is for the
love and ſervice of you, Madam, continued
he that I was born and that I am to live:
my paſſion for you is not of the number of
thoſe that are ruined by time; and this I
reckon I can vow before no perſons better
than before theſe your neareſt relations,
and I vow it with ſo ſincere an a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dor that
I am ready to ſigne it with whatſoever there
is that is deareſt to me. Hearing theſe
words come from him, we have reaſon to
beleive my neice, ſaid <hi>Rolimon,</hi> that <hi>Alcidor</hi>
ſpeaks from his heart, and to what purpoſe
ſhould theſe many ceremonies be uſed where
marriage is the ſubſtance aimed at? My o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
is that you ſhould make a mutuall
contract of love, after which there will be
no fear that any body elſe ſhould pretend
to either of you. You ſpeak, Sir, replied <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>
to him, like one that knows how to find
the knot of ſuch an affaire as this in hand;
And I ſwear, Madam, addreſt he himſelf
to <hi>Dorame,</hi> that, if you will think of no other
husband but <hi>Alcidor,</hi> I will think of no other
wife but <hi>Dorame.</hi> And I proteſt returned <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rame</hi>
to him, that if you will have no other
wife but <hi>Dorame,</hi> I will have no other huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60972:112"/>
but <hi>Alcidor.</hi> He having, as ſoon as thoſe
words were out of her mouth, with a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
veneration kiſt it, they again by <hi>Melian</hi>'s
motion ſolemnely promiſt to marry one the
other as ſoon as ſhe had completed her year
of widdowhood. Which tie being made and
thereby that which all the Company deſired
as firmely ſecured as could be wiſht to be at
preſent they with a generall pleaſantneſs,
continued converſing upon that and other
ſubjects till they were called to ſupper, and
after ſupper till the late houres commanded
them to bed.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lcidor</hi> riſing early the
next morning as being
kept from ſleeping by his
thoughtfull love found
that <hi>Dorame,</hi> whom he
beleived yet in bed, was
gotten up before him and
walkt abroad. Finding her out he entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
her with what ſhe had been entertaining
herſelf, his affections, and ſhe changed not
the ſubject till they were interrupted by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limon,
Melian</hi> and <hi>Vindorix</hi> who came to
bidde them good morrow and farewell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
The Lovers endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them, but they gave them reaſons for
their going away which induced them to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it. Betaking themſelves therefore all
together into the houſe they had been but a
few moments there when <hi>Meonimus</hi> arrived,
and he had not been much longer there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60972:113"/>
he told <hi>Alcidor</hi> that he mother of <hi>Almi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
was about to inform againſt him for the
killing of her ſon, adviſing him not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
getting a pardon by which to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
out of all danger from the Law. At this
notice <hi>Alcidor</hi> was not at all diſturbed, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Polianis</hi> had a better opinion of him
than to be quickly imprinted with a bad one
or indeed to deny him any thing that he ſhould
ask, but <hi>Dorame</hi> was very much troubled, and
chooſing rather to deprive herſelf of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
in his company for a time than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him with her when his ſtay might be
diſadvantageous to him, conjured him with
all ſpeed to make a journey to <hi>Paquin</hi> to the
end that he might prevent his enemies and
put himſelf under covert againſt their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.
This counſell being backt and urged
by the reſt of the Company, he only ſtaied
breakfaſt and badde <hi>Dorame</hi> adieu. <hi>Rolimon,
Melian, Vindorix</hi> and <hi>Meonimus</hi> going a
long with him to his houſe they all ſtaied
there that night, and the next morning par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the three firſt to go home, and <hi>Alcidor</hi>
and <hi>Meonimus</hi> to Court.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Alcidor</hi> going to the King and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
to him his adventures with <hi>Cartage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
and <hi>Almidon</hi> and the danger that he was
in of being proſecuted for their deaths, he
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60972:113"/>
very graciouſly gave him his pardons for
both and cauſed them to be allowed by the
Counſell of twelve Auditors, the Letter
which <hi>Cartagenes</hi> wrot before his death to
<hi>Dorame</hi> and the teſtimony of <hi>Limonides</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
very happily for his juſtification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polianis</hi> farther by the contexture of <hi>Alcidors</hi>
buſineſs underſtanding that <hi>Dorame</hi> was his
Miſtreſs expreſt ſeverall times to him that he
was very much pleaſed with it; one time
in particular, there is nothing, brave <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi>
ſaid he to him, which obſtructs your
loves, for <hi>Floriſa</hi> is courted in marriage by
my Cozen <hi>Eridan, Aſtaſia</hi> is lately dead,
and <hi>Carmelia</hi> hath taken the hahit of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious:
See I ſay if there be any thing to keep
you from purſuing and injoyning your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
affections ſince of your three former
Miſtreſſes there is but one of them retaining
to the world, where alſo ſhe is ſo ſtraightly
guarded that nobody can have her Company
but the Prince whom I now ſpake of. I am
not ignorant of the Love which ſhe hath had
for you, her brother having recounted to me
that which he knew of it by their Uncle, who
hath many times had purpoſes of ſending you
out of the world upon that occaſion. But
ſhe now gives hopes that ſhe will entertain
that new Lover, and not only <hi>Dorilas</hi> wiſhes
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60972:114"/>
you as well as you can deſire, but <hi>Lucimon</hi>
alſo is diſarmed of the choler which he hath
had againſt you, knowing that the offence
which he beleived you to have committed
proceeded not from you but from his neice.
Theſe two Princes I have made your freinds,
and I would have you as ſoon as you can
joine myrtles to your laurells ſo that <hi>Hymen</hi>
as well as <hi>Mars</hi> may render your life glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
The many powerfull reaſons, Sir,
replied <hi>Alcidor,</hi> which I had to hold <hi>Aſtaſia</hi>
in eſteem while he lived render it impoſible
for me not be troubled for her death. If <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſa</hi>
is loved by <hi>Eridan</hi> and acknowledges
the merit of that Prince of your blood, the
ſucceſs will be far more advantageous to
her than if ſhe had nouriſht an affection for
one ſo unworthy of her as myſelf. For <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melia</hi>
I reckon that ſhe could not have beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
herſelf to an abode more convenient to
regret the loſs of her deare <hi>Clidantus</hi> than
that which ſhe hath ſo ſagely choſen. And
for my own particular I have abundant obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to your Majeſty for the acts of Grace
which your Clemency hath granted me,
without that by an exceſs of favor you ſhould
procure me the good will of two Princes
whoſe ill will I have allwayes been appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
of, and as much as I could ſhunned
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:60972:114"/>
the means of provoking. If the Princeſs <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſa</hi>
hath done me the honor of teſtifying
ſome kindneſs to me, I never have abuſed
it, nor have I ever had the temerity to aſpire
to things contrary to reaſon and my duty:
and if for having before them quitted the
party which they headed, they have wiſht
me ill, why did they betake themſelves to
the ſame obedience that made me acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
you my King? Have not they been
conſtrained to ſubject themſelves to the
Laws of your Majeſty as well as to thoſe of
your Kingdome? You have acted, <hi>Alcidor,</hi>
reſumed the King, very well in every thing,
and with the ſervices that you have done me
ſince you have reſtored your ſelf to your
allegiance I have ſo much reaſon to ſatisfie
my ſelf that waiting for ſome better grati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of them I at preſent make you my leif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
of my Company of men at armes. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantus</hi>
is dead, <hi>Alcidor,</hi> purſued he, and my
regret for his death ſufficiently declares
what eſteem I have for men of courage. At
theſe words <hi>Alcidor</hi> could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot hinder him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from letting fall ſome teares, nor could
the King forbear having ſome ſtand in his
eyes, and farther was the memory of the
loſs of that great captain about to carry
them into melancholy, when <hi>Lucimon</hi> and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60972:115"/>
               <hi>Dorilas</hi> came in to them and diſmiſt it. See
the generous <hi>Alcidor,</hi> my Cozens, ſaid the
King to them preſently, love him for the
ſake of his valor, and for love of me; there
are few of his faſhion to be found in the
world: we were juſt now ſpeaking of you.
The King thus accoſting them and <hi>Alcidor</hi>
very civilly addreſſing himſelf to them, they
both imbraced him and acknowledging his
high value, deſired him to beleive that they
had, and as long as they lived, would have a
very cordiall amity for him. To which he
having anſwerd them what was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itting, he
left them and the King together and went to
his Lodging.</p>
            <p>Come thither he wrot to <hi>Dorame</hi> an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of all his occurrencies to this laſt, and
particularly what was become of <hi>Floriſa, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſia</hi>
and <hi>Carmelia.</hi> The concluſion of his
Letter was an aſſurance of the King's appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of their marriage and of his own
ſpeedy returne to her. <hi>Limonides</hi> was the
carrier o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it.</p>
            <p>About three dayes after <hi>Alcidor</hi> being
with the King newes was brought him
that the forces of <hi>Atalantus</hi> had taken <hi>Thiau</hi>
by aſſault and <hi>Senoy</hi> by compoſition, and
made very ill work in the province of <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
Hereupon he with all ſpeed called an
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60972:115"/>
aſſembly in forme of the eſtates and cauſed
to be levied a potent army with which to
put a ſtop to the progreſs of thoſe inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
But while preparations were in hand
againſt them, what by the imprudent will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs
of the inhabitants who would not
receive any ſouldiers in garriſon, and what
by the menaces of ſome factious, they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
<hi>Huc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>io</hi> in open day. Thither for the
recovery of it the King determining within
two or three dayes to march, he told <hi>Alcidor</hi>
that notwithſtanding his affairs of love he
muſt go along with him his Feild-Marſhall;
but withall that he might go firſt and wait
upon his Miſtreſs for a few houres. Which
liberty he uſed with a diligence which carried
him quickly to her, if the firſt ſight of him
inſpired her with joy, he quickly changed it
into affliction, by telling her what a ſhort
limit of time he had to ſtay with her, and
what imployment the King had ingaged him
in which renderd it ſo ſhort. Hearing this, to
go to this ſeige, ſaid ſhe, with a face full of
trouble, is to go to be killed rather than to
fight; I cannot therefore, added ſhe, but
be very much diſſatisfied with your going.
But ſetting before her eyes the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and the forfeiture which he ſhould
make of his favor by not obeying it, then the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60972:116"/>
glory of the imployment and the irreparable
damage which he ſhould contract to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
by refuſing it, perſwading her alſo that
there was not ſo much danger in the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
as ſhe imagined and that in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
he ſhould not be long before he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
he in a good meaſure leſſened her diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
What remained after this of
the three houres which he told her he had to
ſpend with her they made much of in prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
to one another inviolable affections,
and in giving and receiving careſſes of which
the harmleſs fervor and ſweetenſs made it
pitty they ſhould be quickly broken of: But
time calling him away they kiſt and badde
adieu, not without ſighes on both parts,
love requiring that tribute of them.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was <hi>Alcidor</hi> returned to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi>
but he parted from it, the King the next
day marching away to inveſt <hi>Huchio;</hi> and
there the firſt task of his armes was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate
the forces of the enemie's Field-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalls,
and he therein performed wonders.
Some dayes after the ſeige was fixt the groſs
of the beſeiged Cavalry making a ſalley with
deſigne of beating up a quarter, and it being
<hi>Alcidors</hi> let to command that time at the
place where they came on, though he had
not with him above two thirds of the Kings
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60972:116"/>
Company of men at armes, and the enemies
were four or five hundred Lances, he upon
a ſlow pace attended them, and ſtoutly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
them, performed againſt them all that
was poſſible with ſo ſmall a number. He had
not indeed ſtrength enough to keep his men
from being at length beaten back; but he
quickly returned with them to a ſecond
charge, and at the inſtant that <hi>Polianis</hi> was
diſpatching ſuccours to him inflaming his
own courage and animating his Companions
fell with the impetuouſneſs of a Whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde
into the enemy-ſquadrons, put them
all in diſorder, made them turn their backs,
and purſued them, taking and killing them,
as farr as the counterſcarpe of the trench. To
this action the King and <hi>Adraſtus</hi> his Leifte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-generall,
in whoſe ſights it was done,
gave applauſes which plainly fore ſhewed
the memory of it would be immortall. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other engagements made <hi>Alcidor</hi> with
the enemy during the ſiege) continually
throwing himſelf into the moſt dangerous
places) and in all of them he was a very ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfull
purchaſer of renown, but in one of
them together with renown, he got a wound
with a muſquet-ſhot in the legg, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
him for awhile to lie ſtill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Silarmin</hi> Generall of the forces of <hi>Atalan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:60972:117"/>
after he had made many attempts to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
the beſeiged and ſaw he was not able to
atchieve it taking his way home wards, and
thereupon they in <hi>Huchio</hi> (the Indian garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
firſt paſſing out in good order) yeelding
it up to the King, he preſently led his army
(which was compoſed of the military flower
of his Kingdome) after the enemy into their
Countrey: but the memory of his paſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
imprinting ſuch a terror upon their
ſouls that they feared nothing ſo much as
that <hi>Mars</hi> of <hi>China</hi>'s fury: he could by no
means draw them to a battel. There in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
appeared nobody in the Feild to ſtop
his triumphant progreſs: but to prevent the
univerſall ravaging of his territories <hi>Atalan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
diſpatched to him propoſalls of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
and to give his empire a calm he
freely accepted them. Peace being re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht
and the armies on both ſides disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Polianis</hi> promiſt his ſubjects a golden age
in room of that iron one, which had ſo long
and ſo ſadly aggreived them, and what he
promiſt at the inſtant began to appear: the
artiſt workt with ſecurity, the Merchant
trafficked with freedome, the Villager la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
the earth without fear, King, Prince,
Lord, Gentleman, Souldier, they of holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and thoſe of common quality feaſted
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:60972:117"/>
themſelves with thoſe ſweeteneſſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
pleaſure, advantage, which the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
of the ſword had a great while hinderd
them from ſo much as taſting, in a word
all every where in <hi>China</hi> appeared with a
laughing face.</p>
            <p>Of this univerſal joy <hi>Alcidor</hi> took part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
about the King, but not with a full
ſatisfaction: to make it full he muſt ſee <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rame,</hi>
and not only ſee her, but alſo accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
his marriage with her. The King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at his requeſt diſmiſſing him, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
extraordinary commendations of him in
the midſt of his Court and other remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his ſervices worthy of ſuch a Prince,
he flew a long the wayes without reſting till
he was with her. Being gotten again, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(not without a kind of intoxic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion of
delight at their firſt meeting) they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
their time in recounting to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſome remarkable peices of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
which they were not yet acquainted
with, and particularly what had occurred to
them ſince their laſt ſeparation, in diſcourſing
of others and by name of <hi>Cloriaſtes</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melia,</hi>
the former of whom was as well
as the latter enterd into a religious Order, in
entertaining themſelves as occaſion and their
ingenies led them, but principally in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchanging
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:60972:118"/>
pledges of dearneſs and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
the order of their wedding.</p>
            <p>They thus wearing out the year of wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood,
<hi>Alcidor</hi> the next day took horſe
to go wait on <hi>Rolimon, Melian, Vindorix</hi> and
ſome other friends, and having ſpent ſome
dayes upon that occaſion he ſpent two at
home, during which his houſe had the aſpect
of a ſuperbe Court with the viſits which
perſons of Grandeur made him, and with the
noble receptions which he gave them. He
had here indeed abundantly enough of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
ſhewd him, and good company enough
came in to him and was likely to do ſo, to
have tempted him to ſtay longer, but love
called him away, and he took the road to
<hi>Dorame,</hi> having firſt intreated her and his
friends to be the eighth day after at her houſe
to aſſiſt at their hymenean rites.</p>
            <p>The day come and thoſe that were invited
rendring themſelves at the palace of <hi>Dorame</hi>
(for ſo it may well be called, conſidering the
glories with which it ſhonne) the illuſtrious
pair of Lovers were joined together with
ceremonies of exquiſite ſtate; there was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
nothing of the day which did not make
it memorable, the feaſting, the dancing, the
masking, the muſicke were all inſtances of
choice gall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntry and magnificence, but the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:60972:118"/>
faireſt thing of all was the delivering up of
<hi>Dorame</hi> into the hands of <hi>Alcidor</hi> by Ladies
whoſe beauty deſerved, they ſhould have
been lookt upon as ſo many Suns, but that
it was obſcured by that of the Bride.</p>
            <p>What paſt in the night between this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
couple is a myſtery, which to divulge
would be to profane; but they appeared
the next morning like ſuch who had been
drinking to and pledging one another in
thoſe delights which are the prize, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
the food of love. Their humor had
nothing in it, but ſerenity; the Company
therefore had nothing in it, but mirth; and to
nouriſh it to the higheſt, improvement
was made of all the recreations of body and
ſpirit that were gentile and opportune. This
continued eight dayes together, after which
(there being a neceſſity that ſuch feſtivities
ſhould have an end, as well as a beginning)
the aſſembly diſſolved and left <hi>Alcidor</hi>
and <hi>Dorame</hi> to enjoy themſelves by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>But it was not long before <hi>Alcidor</hi> carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Dorame</hi> to his principall Houſe and there
inſtalling her abſolute Miſtreſs of his eſtare,
as he had done before of his heart they kept
a kind of ſecond wedding: Company flowed
in from all the neigbourhood to wiſh them
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:60972:119"/>
joy and pay them honor, and all the time
of their ſtay was ſpent in little elſe but in
Feaſts, Balls, and receiving and making
Viſits.</p>
            <p>There now wanted nothign to complete
<hi>Alcidor</hi>'s ovation, but that his Sun ſhould
diſplay her beams in the horizon of the
Court. Thither therefore they went toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with an equipage which made all <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi>
admire it's ſplendor, as much occuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
as it was, to ſee great things. <hi>Dorame</hi>
was ſo radiant and her retinue ſo bright,
that hardly could there have been imagined a
train perfectly aſſorted to hers, had not
<hi>Alcidor</hi> marched with the ſame air. He
indeed in this notable occaſion omitted none
of thoſe brave things which had been born
with him, and which he had all his life pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed.</p>
            <p>Preſenting themſelves to the King, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
them with demonſtrations of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
favor and contentment in ſeeing
them: Staying about half an houre in his
preſence, the moſt gallant of the Court were
all the while gazing upon them with affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate
admirations: Going away, <hi>Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi>
who at the inſtant came in detained
them a while with an accoſtage made up of
civility.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:60972:119"/>
               <hi>Dorame</hi> indeed while her husband <hi>Cliſidas</hi>
lived was eſteemed one of the faireſt and
moſt charming Ladies of the Court; but
they who knew her then, and conſiderd her
now, and compared what ſhe was then, with
what ſhe was now, proclaimed her beauty &amp;
attractions doubled. In augmentation of
this glory ſhe ſuffered it not to make her
vainly conceited, but the more ſhe was
extolled, the more humbly ſhe demean'd
herſelf: Every wayes were both ſhe and
<hi>Alcidor</hi> of ſuch a frame as made them happy
in one another. Never was correſpondence
more perfect, than theirs, never was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
ſweeter; but this latter laſted not
long. <hi>Dorame</hi> after ſix moons growing hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
with Child had by that means ſo much
indiſpoſition, that ſhe was ſeldome to be ſeen
out of her bed, and <hi>Alcidor</hi> had ſo deep a
ſenſe of it that he was ſeldome to be ſeen
out of a dark humor: her illneſſes increaſt
and therewith his greifs ſwelled high. And
yet amidſt his ſwollen greifs he would have
reckoned himſelf in ſome ſort happy; if he
might ſtill have injoyed her; but to make
him the moſt afflicted man in the world ſhe
was by the ravenous hand of death taken
away from him; ſhe died in Child-bed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with her Child of which ſhe could
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:60972:120"/>
not be delivered. Before ſhe expired, I ſee,
my <hi>Alcidor,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, I muſt go from
you; it is the will of fate, and that is not to
be oppoſed by our wills. I know the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that you have for me, will render my
death bitter to you; but let it be with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
that you afflict yourſelf for it. I have
done, my dear <hi>Alcidor,</hi> added ſhe, I leave
you, Adieu. Saying ſo and imbracing him
ſhe breathed out her ſoul upon his lips. At
the inſtant he grew as void of motion, as if he
had been as much without ſentiment, as the
dead body, he ſent not a ſigh after her, he
made no kind of complaint, he was indeed
wholly ſtupefied with extremity of greif:
But after a while coming to himſelf, he by all
the great kinds of lamentation characterized
himſelf a moſt diſtreſt man, there is nothing
of ſerious and maſculine ſorrow which was
not to be ſeen in him, and he wholly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
himſelf to be governed by it. Oh
Heavens, cried he, what a treaſury of beauty
and virtue you have deſpoiled me of! why
did you make her ſo fair, ſo good, to take her
ſo overhaſtily away? why did you make me
a little while happy in injoyning her, to
render me altogether miſerable in being
without her for the reſt of my dayes?
Oh the forces of adverſity which I have
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60972:120"/>
to conflict with but know not how to ſtand
againſt!</p>
            <p>If the nuptialls of <hi>Dorame</hi> were eximiouſly
remarkable with their refulgent and joyous,
ſo were her funeralls with their ſable and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gubrious
pomp; the King contributed to it
his part, all the Court aſſiſted at it, there
was nothing miſſing in it, which might ſerve,
either for the honor of the dead, whoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and merit chalenged the moſt ſtately ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequies,
or for a teſtimony of the diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Widower's love and greif which were
both extreme. He had indeed ſo much love
for her, that he had none for life; Now that
ſhe was no longer living, he would gladly
have been laid in the grave with her: he
had alſo ſo much greif for the loſs of her
that all mention of comfort was a new way
of afflicting him, that all viſits were
troubleſome to him, and that all endeavors
to appeaſe his ſorrow proved ineffectuall,
thoſe of his other freinds who practiſed all
the meanes of doing it that they could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe,
thoſe of the Princeſs <hi>Floriſa</hi> who ſent
<hi>Alexis</hi> to him upon that errand, and thoſe
of the King who laboured it with a particular
concerne.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Alcidor</hi> was ſpending dayes and
nights in lamenting his loſs, <hi>Polianis</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:60972:121"/>
he could have no heirs to his Crown
by the infertile <hi>Agenora,</hi> upon mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
concluded to divorce her, and though
ſhe was one of the higheſt born Princeſſes of
<hi>Aſia,</hi> and her beauty and ingeny ran parallell
to her birth, yet whether ſhe preferred the
good of the publike before her own intereſt,
or whether ſhe was ſwaied by any private
reaſons, ſhe teſtified no other reliſh of the
reſolution, than what diſpoſed her to conſent
to it. This notable ſeparation was no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
known by the Potentates of <hi>Aſia,</hi> but
they all ſought that <hi>Auguſt</hi> mans alliance;
Princeſſes were offered him together with
Principalities: but of all the pourtraitures
that were preſented to him none pleaſed him
ſo much as that of the Princeſs Partenice, and
with her he tranſlated and accompliſht a
marriage. The conjunction of theſe two
Starrs of the greateſt magnitude and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
and of moſt benigne influence making
<hi>China</hi> all a bright Heaven by their ſhining in
it, made it yet more ſo by their having ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
illuſtrious Star for their iſſue, a Son
whoſe birth made his mother's pains ſweet,
his fathers glories full and the people's joyes
alike great and univerſall. In the publike
rejoicing which was made upon this occaſion
<hi>Alcidor</hi> who had till then done nothing elſe
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60972:121"/>
but ſigh over the fate of <hi>Dorame</hi> thought him
ſelf in duty obliged to be a party. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
induced his ſoul to diſmiſs ſome part of
thoſe black thoughts which reigned in it and
dreſt his face in the characters, which it had
not a long time worn, of cheerfullneſs.
Which the King and Queen ſeeing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that it was an effect of the intereſt
which he took in their happineſs they told
him they were his glad debtours for it, and
taking the opportunity improved it to cleer
his ſpirit from thoſe thick clouds, with which
it was ſtill overcaſt. Here in there workt
with them all of quality that were acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with him, and they had the ſucceſs that
they deſired; he promiſed them not to think
ſo much of Tombes for the future but to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
himſelf, and accordingly frequenting
the palace, viſiting Ladies, and uſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,
he by little and little chaſed away
his melancholy, it contributing to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that the Princeſs <hi>Floriſa</hi> was by the
earneſt perſwaſions of her freinds and by the
ineſtimable merit of <hi>Eridan</hi> wonne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him for her husband, and thought her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
happy in him.</p>
            <p>It being impoſſible that a man of worth as
<hi>Alcidor,</hi> deſtined by the reſerves of fate to
give of his race to that flouriſhing empire to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60972:122"/>
which he had given extraordinary remarkes
of his valour, ſhould remain allwayes a
widower; after he had been a good time ſo,
he ſaw at a ball a Lady from falling in love
with whom he was not able with all his
ſtrength to defend himſelf. Her habit told
him ſhe was a Widow and upon enquiry
he learnt that ſhe was Widow to <hi>Palemon</hi>
who took Prince <hi>Meander</hi> priſoner in battle,
that ſhe was iſſued of one of the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
houſes of the Kingdome and that ſhe
was Miſtreſs of a moſt plentiful fortune.
This he liked very well, but that which
captivated him and made his heart hers was
that her face exactly reſembled <hi>Dorame</hi>'s,
that the eyes, the ſhape, the features, the
aire of the one, were the eyes, the ſhape,
the features, the aire of the other. His paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for her riſing from this ſpring grew to a
large, deep, and rapid ſtream, when by
getting acquaintance with her, he found ſhe
was like <hi>Dorame</hi> not in body only, but in
mind alſo, that the wit and virtues of the
one, were the wit and vertues of the other.
Thinking therefore that as often as he ſaw
<hi>Florinda</hi> he ſaw <hi>Dorame</hi> and beleiving that
after <hi>Dorame,</hi> he could not find ſo meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
an object of his affections as <hi>Florinda</hi> he
ſtaied not long before he addreſt himſelf to
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:60972:122"/>
her in the quality of a lover, and what with
the King's Favouring of his Suite, what with
her friends and particularly the diſcreet <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lida</hi>
her Siſter telling her, that to make her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
happy ſhe muſt take him for her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
what with the affectionate obſervances
which he uſed towards her, what with the
unmatchable accompliſhments which ſhe
ſaw in him, ſhe was wonne to admit him in
that quality, after ſhe had driven to deſpair
with her coldneſs many gallant perſons who
ambitioned the title of her ſervant, and not
only ſo, but to love him alſo as much as
ever did <hi>Floriſa; Aſtaſia, Carmelia</hi> or <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rame.</hi>
Cupid indeed had no reaſon to be
leſs favourable to him, than <hi>Mars,</hi> for he
had ſacrificed upon the Altars of the one, as
well as of the other, and that with equal
devotion.</p>
            <p>During the tranſaction of theſe amours as
<hi>Alcidor</hi> was one day returning from the
chaſe, there met him an unknown and in
ſo handſome a faſhion requeſted him to be
his Second in a combate which was that
hour aſſigned him, telling him who he was
(and he was <hi>Periander</hi>) and who were of
the other part, and what was the ground of
the Quarrel that he without any farther ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
went along with him. Fighting they
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:60972:123"/>
killed thoſe with whom they fought, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Paquin</hi> they found themſelves to be
Cozens, meeting with in a day or two, their
action paſſing about upon the wing of fame,
they contented themſelves with the elogies
that were given them under the ſafe names
of Incognitoes without being ſo imprudently
vain, as to chalenge the intereſt which they
had in them. But <hi>Loſivel</hi> whom they left
for dead upon the Feild, being enough ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with their perſons, as well as too
much, with their valours, before he died
made report of both. Herewith all the
Court preſently ſounded, and it was not
long before it came to <hi>Florinda.</hi> So ſhe gave
her lover to underſtand by the ſevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
with which he entertained him the
next time that he ſaw him: but the excuſes
which he made for what he had done, and
the promiſes wherewith he aſſured her that
he would ingage him ſelf no more in
ſuch Quarells eaſily obtained his pardon
of her.</p>
            <p>Hence <hi>Celida</hi> took occaſion to repreſent
to her Siſter that it very much imported her
to haſten her marriage with him. <hi>Alcidor,</hi>
alledged ſhe, hath too much of the man in
him to turn his back to honor, or to refuſe
the combate when obliged to it. His <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

active and known courage will be continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ready to carry him into dangers, but it
may not always bring him ſafe out of
them; for though he is one of the moſt vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
men in the world, he is not immortall,
a misfortune may befall him: but when he
is your husband, your influences will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
him from hazarding his life, and he
will preſerve himſelf for love of you, when
he would not, for his own ſake. Procure
therefore as ſoon as you can this good to
him and to yourſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Florinda,</hi> liking and following the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
by her inflaming forces, and expert
management of them bred in <hi>Alcidor</hi> ſo
eager a thirſt of having their marriage ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that it was, before a month was gone by,
diſpatched. It was celebrated with the
preſence of the King and Queen and ſeverall
Princes and Princeſſes, and the celebrity
went beyond all example; that of his wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with <hi>Dorame</hi> was excelled by it. And
not only the pomp of the latter was more
ſplendid, than that of the former, but the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
alſo was much better, For <hi>Dorame</hi> lived
with him not one Year, but <hi>Florinda</hi> many
Years; by <hi>Dorame</hi> he had no Child that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
her, by <hi>Florinda</hi> he had 3 Sonnes and 2
Daughters, all of them of rare Endowments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:60972:124"/>
For a long time was <hi>Polianis</hi> as happy a
King, and <hi>China</hi> as flouriſhing a Kingdome
as any in the World, they had no experience
what the troubles of arms meant: but they
were at length diſturbed by the Indian King,
who as if unable to be quiet, but in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietudes
of War; And ambitious of meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the title of Conqueror, and uſpurper to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
beſeiged a Town with the people of
which, who lived then, and live ſtill in a
common wealth, <hi>Polianis</hi> had a very ſtrict al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance.
His ſuccor therefore being begged
by them he cauſed the drum to beat, the
Trumpet to ſound and an army to advance,
of which that great Captain and Prince <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſileon</hi>
found him ſelf conſtrained to ſay that
he never ſaw a braver Nobleſs or more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
Fantaſſins, and which ſtriking a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
into the enemy, made them fly before
them, handled them very much to their
dammage in their flight and diſſipated them
ſo, that there was no fear left of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.
In this expedition in which all was
done, that either the glory of <hi>Polianis</hi> or the
relief, of his allies required, <hi>Melicertus</hi> being
Generall, <hi>Alcidor</hi> was his Leiftenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and Feild-marſhall of all the Cavalry,
and the Cheifes and their triumphant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
preſenting themſelves to the King, he
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:60972:124"/>
pay'd him the ſecond honors, which <hi>Melicer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
was ſo far from looking upon with an

But <hi>Alcidor</hi> who loved her as his Child and

deſired to have her with him

who conſidered that his competitors were

repleniſht his Coffers with vaſt heaps of
Money, and the gallantry of his diſpoſition
carrying him after the ſoſteneſſes of love to
the roughneſſes of War he determined with
himſelf to make the Barbarians feel the
weight and ſharpneſs of his Sword. He
armed ſo puiſſantly that all the great Maſters
of the World took notice of it, but which
of them all he aimed at, was a myſtery which
they could by no means diſcover. <hi>China</hi>
ſwarmed with Souldiers as banks with piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires,
the Canon was upon the roade, the
Captains had their Rendevous and <hi>Alcidor</hi>
had an imployment amongſt them the moſt
glorious that he had ever had. But, oh dire

the Field, as he was buſied about the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:60972:125"/>

that which affected him was, that his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign

have the glory of carrying them back (or of
endeavouring it at the leaſt) to their own,
without ſuffering as much as he was able
any dammage to be done them either in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

anſwered that from the inſtant that he had
left the league he had preſerved his lozalty
intemerate to the great <hi>Polianis,</hi> and that
there were no propoſitions ſo advantageous
or any thing elſe ſo powerfull as to be able
to corrupt it to his Son <hi>Ariſtenus.</hi> According

            <p>

while he was executing them with his two

Horſe of the Garriſon of <hi>Holepaou</hi> were gone
to the ſeaſide to meet a Convoy that was
coming to them, he was upon them at the

that he made and other parts of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialiſme</hi>
that he performed, ſo intimidated the
cheife who had ingaged himſelf to defend
the Town. (He was <hi>Ariances</hi> Brother to <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſten</hi>)
that he thought himſelf happy in ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring
it upon compoſition. At the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
he by the Kings command ſet the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in form of battell while the enemy
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:60972:129"/>
came out of the Town, and a Garriſon was
placed in it, and after that conducted <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances</hi>
and his men to two parts of it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them from being ill uſed.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Anchieu</hi> there capitulated and yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Holepaou,</hi> forced to it by want of the
ſupplies which <hi>Alcidor</hi> had deprived them
of, and after <hi>Holepaou</hi> ſeverall other Towns
to which the King led his forces.</p>
            <p>About this time as <hi>Alcidor</hi> was coming
all alone from a covent of Religious, whither
he would have no body accompany him in
regard he had buſineſs of ſecrecy as well as
importance with one of the Covent, there
met him two Gentlemen of the Regiment
of the Kings Guards, who accoſted him
with complaints of an injury which they
had received and which they could not poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
up, and he very civilly asking them what
was the name of him, who had offended
him and what the offence, it is yourſelf,
Sir, ſaid one of them, letting him ſee that he
knew him, who have abuſed us, at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering
up of <hi>Ancheou,</hi> when we would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to your order have gone into the Town,
ſtrikeing us with the flat of your Sword.
Would you then, replied <hi>Alcidor,</hi> have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for this? Though, added he, I
might uſe my eminent charge in armes for
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:60972:130"/>
my diſpenſation, I am nevertheleſs ready to
give it you, only let the one off you draw of
while I have to do with the other. With
thoſe words taking to task the forwardeſt
of them he in a minute had wounded him in
the thigh and diſarmed him. After which
paſſing the next way to the other, he found
him ready in ſtead of fighting to aske pardon
and he freely gave it him. The King after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
coming to know the buſineſs and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the Souldiers to be puniſht; he gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
procured both their pardons of him.
But he withall incurred himſelf the cenſure
of the other Field-Marſhalls who told him,
that they would not follow his example in
ſatisfying every one that took things ill from
them: To which, you may do as you ſee
good, replied he, but it is a humor which I
by narure have, and which I know not how
to leave off, never to refuſe the combate
when it is demanded of me. Not that I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
myſelf from being reproveable for it,
or that I ſhall not endeavor to moderate it
by the directions of reaſon. Acting ſo, ſaid
<hi>Arpaſax</hi> to him, and not hazarding your life,
which is of conſequence and ought to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
care of, upon occaſions of frivolous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
you will be ſo far from impairing your
glory that you will increaſe it. If you muſt
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:60972:130"/>
die by the Sword, it ought to be at the head
of an army and in the ſervice of your King
who values you more than all his Captains
beſides. I ſhould conſent to what you ſay,
returned <hi>Alcidor</hi> to him, was I owner of
your fortitude and other worths; but ſince
I well know to what degree I am to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
pardon me, if I tell you that I place
your Elogy of me in the range of flattery.
Truth deſerves not to be ſo ſtiled, ſaid <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſax</hi>
again, and you would very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
your judgment ſhould you not own the
difference between the one and the other.
But to make you acknowledge for true that
which I have ſaid concerning the account
in which his Majeſty holds you, I need only
put you in mind of the choice which he hath
made of you, abſolutely and in quality of
Generall to command his armyes, and of
the many meritorious and inclitous actions
which you have atchieved in War, as in
your element. You handle me with too
much quickneſs, replied <hi>Alcidor</hi> to him,
and I ſhall chooſe rather not to deny what
you ſay, than to conteſt with you any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inquenhu,</hi> while ſeverall of the Towns
that were its companions in mutinying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:60972:131"/>
diſplaying the enſignes of rebellion, <hi>Alcidor</hi>
was ſent thither by him to learn the ſtate of
the place and enemy. Returning and repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
what he had learnt, he was appointed
by a counſell of War to go thither again
the next day to obſerve the places at which
they might aſſault it. As he was doing what
he was appointed they of the Town ſallied
out upon him, but he received them in ſuch
a manner that a great part of them never
re-entred but remained behind upon the
wayes. Two dayes after they ſet upon the
Town in three places, on the right hand the
couragious <hi>Belican</hi> commanding, on the left
the judicious <hi>Briſelin,</hi> the middle the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
<hi>Alcidor,</hi> and they all bravely performed
their parts, but <hi>Alcidor</hi> with ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
that he was the Cheife (if not the
ſole) cauſe that the Town was preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
up. Here <hi>Ariſtenus</hi> left him to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all as he ſaw good with eight Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the regiment of his forein Guards,
and as many of that of his Chinoiſe, but with
injunction to be with him within nine dayes
at Quichio. Coming hither as he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined,
he with Prince <hi>Tirenas</hi> with ſo much
life attaked the Town that all within trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with feare and lookt upon themſelves
as at the laſt gaſpe.</p>

During this ſeige <hi>Ermauſtain</hi> going with

which <hi>Filiſtin</hi> and <hi>Aigremont</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiged,
<hi>Silvanus</hi> who was then ſixteen Years
old followed him with the Kings Company
of men at armes whom he in his Fathers
room commanded, and nine hundred of the
Horſe, when at their arrivall they found
the place taken, for the re-taking of it bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the whole army of the enemies, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a conflict with them in which they took
two of their Canons, he therein did things
worthy of <hi>Alcidor's</hi> Son and which made the
Generall in a particular manner admire him.
He received in this occaſion a wound with a
Piſtoll-ſhot, but the Generall taking care of
him and making him to do ſo of himſelf, he
was quickly well of it.</p>
            <p>During the ſame ſiege of <hi>Quichio, Alcidor</hi>

But while he handled them roughly in that
part where he was, they were induſtrious to
revenge themſelves elſe where, and their
induſtry proſpered ſo that they ſurprized a
very conſiderable Town. Advertiſement
hereof being brought him, and that the
caſtle of it held out ſtill for the King, though
it was in the Worſt Seaſon of Winter, he
ſent men to the aſſiſtance of the caſtle who
by ladders and cords planted a-long the

this he going on to other executions they

after the ſeige was laid, Prince <hi>Meander</hi>
commanding the Army at Land and Prince
<hi>Dorilas</hi> that at ſea, fell out the navall battell
of <hi>Liampo,</hi> in which ſo ſuperbe a victory
was obtained over the forces of the rebells
that they were throughout the Kingdome
conſtrained to ſue to the King for his grace,
that which he according to the uſuall ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his diſpoſition granted them.</p>
            <p>A univerſall calm recovered, <hi>Ariſtenus</hi>

but not without taking <hi>Alcidor</hi> along with
him, as he did alſo in the other little jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
which he made for the good of his
affairs.</p>
            <p>At their return to <hi>Paquin Florinda</hi> being

met with an unſpeakable joy. Having
ſtaid a month or two at Court, leaving <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanns</hi>
there, they retired into the Countrey,
having ſpent half a Year in the Countrey
they re-paſt to the Court. In both places
they led a moſt happy life, happy in regard
of the innocent amenities with which the
Countrey ſerved them, and of the braver
delights, with which the Court entertained
them, happy, in regard that in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
they were by the Nobility and Gentry
moſt kindly and civilly reſpected, by the
commonalty little leſs than ſuperſtitiouſly
worſhipt, and that at the Court <hi>Ariſtenus</hi>

much of them as the principal ornaments of

Children were by all eſteemed as rare

<hi>Dolompus</hi> (the latter of which his Father
had ſent to <hi>Mongul</hi>) of moſt genuine cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

               </gap>tire love between themſelves, the exact

liberty which they had of a mutual fruition,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:60972:134"/>
that which was agreeable to the one being
ſo to the other, and though they had been
married many Years, as pathetick dearneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
continually paſſing between them, as
if they had not been joyned together a
month.</p>
            <p>Together with <hi>Alcidor</hi> and <hi>Florinda</hi>
(though ſcarce by the ſame meaſure with
them) the Court alſo was happy, it was
wholly a theatre of gallantries: War and
the things that affright and moleſt were
ſcarce ſo much as mentioned, all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe
was of love, of the chaſe, of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
of feaſts, of all the more elegant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations
of humane life. There indeed
ſpread a felicity over all the Kingdome, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
bleſſing it with a ſerene tranquillity and
an exuberancy of good things. But the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
was at length diſturbed, the workers
of the paſt tempeſts raiſing new ones; <hi>Liam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po</hi>
forgetful of the mercy which the King
had ſhewed it when at the next door to ruine
renewed its old factions, and the Iſle of
<hi>Varella</hi> was powerfully and ſharply aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the <hi>Japonoiſes.</hi> Aftertaind of this the
King, who armed with ſpeed, to prevent
the miſcheif with which he beleived the Iſle
of <hi>Chapaſi</hi> threatened, commanded <hi>Alcidor</hi>
to put himſelf into it, and it was in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:60972:135"/>
that he had ſet foot on ground there
with a great number of Gentlemen, who rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
it a fair glory to fight under his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
            <p>To help him make good his charge, there
was quickly ſent to him by the diligence of
the admirable Oreſtes eight thouſand Foot
and fifteen hundred Horſe, and with theſe
aids he ſo well diſpoſed the Iland to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
that the <hi>Japonoiſes</hi> coming three
dayes after to view it, found it too well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
and managed, to be aſſaulted. After
this the King ſeeing that the deſigne of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limorus</hi>
was wholly ſet to force the Ile of
<hi>Varella,</hi> cauſed a good part of <hi>Alcidors</hi> forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
to be joyned with others and make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
thither, and the ſucceſs was that they
compelled the <hi>Japonoiſes</hi> with great loſs to
retire to their ſhips.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Callimorus</hi> being gone (<hi>Ariances</hi> who came
with him fled alſo back with him to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
at <hi>Meaco</hi>) <hi>Alcidor</hi> who had not as yet
ſtirred from <hi>Chapaſi</hi> was orderd by the King
to go Feild-marſhall to the ſeige of <hi>Liampo.</hi>
He was again upon intelligence that <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ilus</hi>
had forces in the Feild which he intended to
put into <hi>Liampo,</hi> or elſe to divert the ſiege
with them, ordered by him with eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Horſe to go ſeek him out and ſight
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60972:135"/>
him; and taking with him <hi>Silvanus</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lompus</hi>
(the latter of which, the newes of the
arming had brought from <hi>Mongul,</hi> where he
had been dangerouſly wounded at the ſiege
of <hi>Teudac,</hi>) he made his courſe, but
could no where meet with them that he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for.</p>
            <p>Returned to the Kings quarters he had
paſt but few dayes there before he received
the newes of the ſickneſs, and within a few
houres after of the death of <hi>Florinda,</hi> newes
which filled his great heart as full of greif
as it could poſſible hold and not break, and
which put his two Sonnes all in ſadneſs. He
had Condolers of his unhappineſs the King
and all of his acquaintance, and, when
ſeeing the change of his habit they had learnt
the cauſe of it, the whole army, the King
withal together with others his freinds read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lectures to him of patience and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
He had indeed for arguments of quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himſelf, that ſhe was fallen into a ſleep
for which it was below a ſoul of true cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to torment it ſelf, and from which all
his Stock of Tears and ſighes could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
her, that the Queen and Court had
taken all the care and pains about her, not
only, which humanity, but which alſo a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
tenderneſs could ſuggeſt, and that he
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:60972:136"/>
had neither himſelf nor any other to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of for his not ſeeing her in her ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
the firſt moment that ſhe fell ill a
Cur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ier being diſpatched to him with notice
of it, and ſhe dying within ſix hours after,
of which alſo he had as quick a meſſenger.
But after all he had an earneſt mind to
throw aſide his charge and arms and go
weep over her: that which ſtop him from
doing it was a juſt conſideration that his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
had preſent need of his ſervice and
demanded it, and that therefore to leave
him would be to incurre an opprobry from
which he ſhould never be able to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
Let us wait therefore, ſaid he to
himſelf, to go pay our laſt duties to that
part of our dear <hi>Florinda</hi> that remaines, till
this rebellious City, which is at the even of
its being ſubdued, be fully ſo. It is not
now the firſt time that we have received an
infelicity of this kind, we have too well
learnt the ſad uſage of reſenting a wife's death
to forget it, and ſhall we make leſs reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
againſt the oppreſſions of affliction
now, than heretofore when our ſpirit had
more of impurity, than now by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of age it hath? The exerciſe of Tears
is to be left to women, we have reaſon to
ſhew ourſelves more conſtant. And beſides
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:60972:136"/>
into what region is <hi>Florinda</hi> gone that we
ſhould do nothing but lament for her? Is
ſhe in an abode that is inacceſſible to us?
Is ſhe not there, where all faithfull ſouls
have a place reſerved for them, and where
it is not long before we ſhall ſee her again?
Let us forbear then to ſigh over her ſtate of
bliſs, and reſume the temper which we had
before the loſs of her, that ſo we may the
better imploy ourſelves as our duty and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
require in things importing to the
ſpeedy reduction of the enemy. This reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
tooke and followed <hi>Alcidor,</hi> and by his
advice and example his Sonnes alſo, very
much to the ſatisfaction of the King in regard
both of the benefit which thereby they
would receive themſelves, and of that alſo
which would accrew from it to his own
affairs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Japonoiſes</hi> having a good mind to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
<hi>Liampo,</hi> but in regard of the invincible
obſtacles that ſtood in their way contenting
themſelves to appear upon the ſea and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
the beſeiged though they had thereby
their hopes fruſtrated continued obſtinately
enough to defend themſelves; but at length
great numbers of them being deſtroyed by
the arms of the beſiegers, and greater by
ſickneſs and famine, ſo that the Town made
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:60972:137"/>
haſt to be deſert of inhabitants, they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated
to beg the Kings mercy, and
what they neceſſarily begged, he freely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged.
Having maſtered this City, which
three Kings his predeceſſours could not do,
and re-eſtabliſht there the old Religion of
<hi>China,</hi> he returned in triumph to <hi>Paquin;</hi> and
thither <hi>Alcidor</hi> waited upon him, and then
applied himſelf to perform the ſupreme
honours to <hi>Florinda.</hi> When he came to ſee
her body in the Coffin, he was wholly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
with greif, and his ſentiments were
more equitable, than to be blamed: but his
reaſon after a while making good its empire
and tempering his paſſion, his Cheif care
was taken up about her funerals, and he laid
her in the grave with a State in which
Mourning was renderd full of Majeſty.</p>
            <p>While the King continued at <hi>Paquin Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidor</hi>
was always about him, and new oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
calling him abroad, he and his Sons
attended him. They were of his Cheife aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
when he forced his way through the
barricades and other obſtacles that ſhut it
up, and diſſipated thoſe that oppoſed it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived
<hi>Baiador</hi> that was ſtraightly beſeiged
upon the Prince <hi>Nimeſis,</hi> and conſtrained <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippus</hi>
who had cauſed this trouble to ſue to
him for peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:60972:137"/>
Affairs being quieted on that ſide, <hi>Ariſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
left <hi>Clomedon</hi> there with ſufficient forces
to maintain the quiet, and paſt into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Quiechen</hi> in queſt of <hi>Filiſtin</hi> who
with great numbers of men ravaged the
Countrey; but though this Prince was the
grand Cheife of the diſobedient party, and
had the boldneſs to counter-act the Kings au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
he durſt no where appear before
him. In this expedition <hi>Tocichu</hi> was begirt by
the King, taken by aſſault and put all in
blood. At this ſeige <hi>Dolompus</hi> was wounded
with a Muſquet-ſhot in the head together
with other little hurts, while his elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had better fortune, though he continually
engaged himſelf in moſt hazardous ſervices.</p>
            <p>Taking warning by <hi>Tocichu, Hilani</hi> opened
its gates to the King: <hi>Hilani</hi> leading the
way ſeveral other Townes returned to their
allegiance, <hi>Filiſtin</hi> giving them the ſalutary
counſel to do ſo, who himſelf alſo recounted
his diſloialty and obtained pardon of the
King both for himſelf, and all the party of
which he had been head and protector.
Things being brought to this iſſue, the King
returned to <hi>Paquin,</hi> leaving the great Oreſtes
and <hi>Alcidor</hi> to receive the Townes to the
obedience that they owed him and to cauſe
their fortifications to be razed: and they
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:60972:138"/>
were not long before they were again with
him with an account of their negotiation
which perfectly ſatisfied him.</p>
            <p>Envious of the Univerſal peace which
<hi>China</hi> now enjoyed, and reſolved as it
ſeems to ſhew himſelf, what he was reputed
to be, the moſt inconſtant Prince in the
World <hi>Alcippus</hi> performed nothing of what
he had promiſed <hi>Ariſtenus</hi> when he made
peace with him, but by freſh and thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable
provocations obliged him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commence
War. <hi>Oreſtes</hi> paſt the mountains
with fourty thouſand men, took <hi>Chaquoam</hi>
in the ſight of <hi>Alcaſtus</hi> and put that flitting
prince in ſuch a fright that he ſtaied no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
before he repented of what he had done.
<hi>Ariſtenus</hi> himſelf alſo in the ſequele marched
with a great army into <hi>Camboia; Alcidor</hi>
who was Field-marſhall of it led the Van
when they entred the Countrey and finding
Prince <hi>Euſebes</hi> retiring with his Army was
earneſt to have bid them battle: but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
clear day he ſaw of utterly defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them, and whatſoever aſſurance he gave
the King of it, he could not get his conſent
that he might fall on, he would reſerve, he
ſaid, his forces to make himſelf Maſter of
all the places of ſtrength in <hi>Camboia,</hi> and to
out their Prince in his Shirt. But it could not
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:60972:138"/>
well be that the two Armies ſhould meet
without ſtriking a blow, <hi>Alcidor</hi> moved the
Quarel, prefaced with ſome skirmiſhes,
made a looſe, broke into the midſt of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
ſtrawed the ground with five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of their bodies and retreated gloriouſly,
the King approving the exploit though not
agreeing to the attempt. At length the whole
conduct of the Army in <hi>Camboia</hi> was left to
him, and he beſeiged Townes and took them
by the meaſure of quickly bringing under the
whole State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daiador</hi> in the mean time the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
place of its Countrey was vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
beſeiged by the <hi>Indians</hi> who reſolved
to take it or dye, if they were not hindered
by a greater ſtrength, than theirs, and in all
appearance they had not long to ſtay to be
poſſeſt of it, ſo low had they brought it.
Thither therefore <hi>Ariſtenus</hi> with all ſpeed
cauſed thirty thouſand men to advance under
three of his moſt experienced Captains,
and they with Sword in one hand and Piſtol
in the other bravely ſet it at liberty. Never
received <hi>Alcaſtus</hi> ſuch an affront, and he was
the more ſenſible of it becauſe he received it
in his native Countrey. To ſee indeed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and his army proudly triumpht over by
the <hi>Chinoiſes</hi> while they forced them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefully
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60972:139"/>
to diſlodge from before the Town
about which they lay encampt waiting only
the hour in which according to the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
that was made, they were to enter; It
was a diſpleaſure which he was ſo far from
being able to digeſt that he endured not to
ſurvive it, but within a few dayes after mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
off the World. <hi>Bajador</hi> releived the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
King, and the Potentates that ſided with
him were conſtraind to make a peace with
<hi>Ariſtenus</hi> upon conditions advantageous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to him to declare him Victour in the
War. The Caſtles, Townes, places which
upon theſe conditions he delivered back to
<hi>Alcippus</hi> were all monuments of <hi>Alcidors</hi> vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
that had conquerd them. Indeed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
the enemy in their own Countrey and
vanquiſh them, to inviron Townes and take
them, to aſſault Places and win them, by
all the methods of valour to render for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
the arms of the juſt <hi>Ariſtenus</hi> were
his ordinary exerciſes (both at other times
and) while he had the care of the War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Alcippus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the labours of this extraordinary man
muſt have an end; they are glorious enough
for him, they have dreſt his name with
flowers of honour which will never wither,
the grand Cheifes of the World diſcourſe
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60972:139"/>
of him with elogies of praiſe which poſterity
will with publicke voice tranſmit to the end
of time, and <hi>Ariſtenus</hi> regards him as one
whoſe Sword hath ſtrucke as many impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
blowes in his ſervice as any's whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and whoſe merit might plead title to as
rich rewards. In anſwer to his merit he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
to ſettle him in the Viceroy-ſhip
which <hi>Polianis</hi> a few dayes before his death
deſigned him: But as he is about to do it
he is called to arms by the Province of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gones</hi>
for the Chaſtiſing of that <hi>Felonious.</hi> The
leading of this War is committed to <hi>Alcidor;</hi>
but when he ſhould take the Field, he falls
ſick. It is at firſt a heavy ſurcharge of trouble
to him beſides that of his ſickneſs that he is
hindered from waiting upon his Maſter and
gathering the roſe which is at the end of the
thorn. But when he findes by the courſe
of his diſeaſe that he can in all likelyhood
have none but a fatall iſſue of it, he looks
upon thoſe former thoughts as no longer ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
he wholly applies himſelf to think
of his retreate, the honours of the World
he with a holy elevation of mind contemnes,
and hath his deſires grow cold to every
thing elſe, but to go and enjoy a purity of
happineſs with his <hi>Dorame</hi> and <hi>Florinda.</hi> In
fine ſeeing his end at hand he with moſt
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:60972:140"/>
ſage remonſtrances incites his Children to
follow the way of virtue and glory, and
then compoſes himſelf with a pious cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to undergo the aſſaults of death which
he feels beginning upon him, and which
within a quarter of an hour diſlodge his
heroick ſoul.</p>
