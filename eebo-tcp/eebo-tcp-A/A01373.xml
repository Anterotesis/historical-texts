            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>For to avoyde thoſe doynges greate,</l>
            <l>that might on them befall:</l>
            <l>For by example are they taught to do,</l>
            <l>and what they ſhall</l>
            <l>Receiue for their malicious mindes,</l>
            <l>and wicked Treaſons greate:</l>
            <l>As now of late it hath been ſeen</l>
            <l>through Iuſtice iudgements ſeate.</l>
            <l>That holdes the ſworde to do the right,</l>
            <l>and ſtrike where blowes ſhould fall:</l>

            <l>that lately here did die,</l>
            <l>In Paules Churchyarde he left his life,</l>
            <l>on Galows taule and hie.</l>
            <l>Who from the priſon where he lay,</l>
            <l>was drawne on Hardell there:</l>
            <l>For good example of all ſuch,</l>
            <l>that they might take the feare.</l>
            <l>For to beware of ſuche like facte,</l>
            <l>as well in worde as deede:</l>
            <l>Leaſt they for theyr like hier at laſt</l>
            <l>no better like to ſpeede.</l>
            <l>* Now marke his ende and what I ſhall</l>
            <l>reporte here of his death:</l>
            <l>For why theſe eares of mine did here,</l>
            <l>and iyes while that his breath</l>
            <l>Remained in his wicked corps,</l>
            <l>which ſtubbornly did die:</l>
            <l>As one me thought ſomthing beſt raught</l>
            <l>through Treaſons crueltie.</l>
            <l>His Gowne of Grograin he put of,</l>
            <l>which on his backe he had:</l>
            <l>And eke his Doublet which was made</l>
            <l>of Sattin ſomwhat ſad.</l>
            <l>Into his Shirte he then was ſtript,</l>

            <l>that eche man there might ſe.</l>
            <l>Theſe wordes he ſpake, and ſaid alowde</l>
            <l>my Maiſters all and ſome:</l>
            <l>One thinge I haue to ſay to you,</l>
            <l>now that I here am come.</l>
            <l>That is, I pray you all with me</l>
            <l>beare recorde what I ſay:</l>
            <l>I here proteſt before you all</l>
            <l>, this preſent dieyng day,</l>
            <l>That I was neuer Traytour ſure,</l>
            <l>nor Treaſon to my Queene</l>
            <l>Did neuer do, nor neuer thought,</l>
            <l>that euer hath been ſeene.</l>
            <l>And for the facte wherefore I die,</l>
            <l>I can it not denie:</l>
            <l>But at the Gate where as the Bull</l>
            <l>was hanged, there was I,</l>
            <l>In company, on more with me,</l>
            <l>did hange it vp together:</l>
            <l>And though in place, I had not bin,</l>
            <l>it had not ſcaped euer.</l>
            <l>From hanging vp, for ſuredly,</l>
            <l>for that ſame preſent day:</l>
            <l>It had bin hanged, in that place,</l>
            <l>though I had been away.</l>
            <l>Then ſayde the Shreue, vnto him,</l>
            <l>Oh <hi>Felton</hi> do remember:</l>
            <l>That thou haſt bin, a Traytour great</l>
            <l>and to the Queene offender.</l>
            <l>And ſurely thou moſte Trayterouſly,</l>
            <l>and ſtubbornly haſt thou ſought,</l>
            <l>The beſt thou couldſt to go aboute,</l>
            <l>thy Prince to bringe to nought.</l>
            <l>And eke the Realme and all the reſt,</l>
            <l>as mutche as in thee lay,</l>
            <l>Thou ſoughſt by thy Traiterous harte,</l>
            <l>to bringe vnto decay.</l>
            <l>Therfore call vnto God the Lord,</l>
            <l>and pray him from thy hart:</l>
            <l>That he receaue thy ſoule to reſt,</l>
            <l>when thou from hence ſhalt part.</l>
            <l>Well ſo I do, and here I craue,</l>
            <l>you all good people pray</l>
            <l>For me, that ready is to dye,</l>
            <l>and then began to ſay,</l>
            <l>Into thy hands, Oh Lord my God,</l>
            <l>I yeeld my Soule and Breath:</l>
            <l>For thou haſt me redeemd, I ſay,</l>
            <l>with thy moſt precious death.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>In manus tuas Domine,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>and ſo the reſt he ſayde,</l>
            <l>The Hangman then did throwe him of,</l>
            <l>and ſo his breath was ſtaide.</l>
            <l>He hanged theare vpon the Tree,</l>
            <l>and in a litle ſpace:</l>
            <l>They cut him downe incontinent,</l>
            <l>that Iuſtice might take place.</l>
            <l>Wher as he quartred ſhoulde be,</l>
            <l>according to the Lawe:</l>
            <l>And to the Iudgement that he had,</l>
            <l>to make thoſe ſtande in awe.</l>
            <l>That be of his affinitie:</l>
            <l>and ſurely there be ſome,</l>
            <l>That thinkes that he deſerude not death</l>
            <l>in all that he hath don.</l>
            <l>He then diſmembred was ſtraight way,</l>
            <l>when he had ended that:</l>
            <l>His Belly ripped open wide,</l>
            <l>his Bowels all he gat.</l>
            <l>And to the fire he ſtraight them threwe,</l>
            <l>which ready there was made:</l>
            <l>And there conſumed all to duſt,</l>
            <l>as is the fiers trade.</l>
            <l>His Head cut of, the Hangman then,</l>
            <l>did take it vp in hand:</l>
            <l>And vp alofte he did it ſhowe,</l>
            <l>to all that there did ſtand.</l>
            <l>And then his body in Fowre partes,</l>
            <l>was quartred in that place:</l>
            <l>More pitty that his Traytorous Hart,</l>
            <l>could take no better grace.</l>
            <l>And thus he had his iuſt deſarte,</l>
            <l>as well he had deſerued:</l>
            <l>I would the reſt that not repents,</l>
            <l>were likewiſe alſo ſerued.</l>
            <l>Beware you Papiſts all beware,</l>
            <l>be true vnto your Queene:</l>
            <l>Let not your Traiterous hartes be bent</l>
            <l>as here tofore hath been.</l>
            <l>Stand not againſt the liuing God,</l>
            <l>ſpurne not againſt his Law:</l>
            <l>Kicke not againſt the Pricke I ſay,</l>
            <l>but haue him ſtill in awe.</l>
            <l>Be not aſhamde to torne in time,</l>
            <l>ſet ſhamefaſtneſſe aſide:</l>
            <l>No ſhame it is to turne to God,</l>

            <l>Wherin you lay a ſleape long while,</l>
            <l>forgetting of his grace:</l>
            <l>Now call the refore vnto the Lord,</l>
