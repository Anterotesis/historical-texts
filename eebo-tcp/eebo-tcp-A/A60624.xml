         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

believe in, and you apply them by faith, and so receives the comfort, it will not stand you in stead in the needful time, for whilst you talk of faith, and applying the promises by faith, you deceive your selves in your imaginations, being yet in your sins, and out of the faith of the Son of God which puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the heart, and so you are out of the condition of those who lived in the promises, and knew them to stand sure in the seed; Therefore all unto the light come, and in it wait, that you may feel the same power to work in you, and bring the same thing to passe in you, as it hath done in ages before you, that whilst you talk of liberty by Christ Jesus, your selves may not be found servants unto sin, and in bondage to corruption, for of whatsoever a man is overcome, unto the same is he in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, &amp; if you be found servants unto sin, you are in bondage to it, &amp; not in the freedom of the Son, so all having sinned, all must unto the light be turned, and by it be Redeemed and know the power of it to work true freedom into the glorious liberty, before any can truly say that they are set free, for all must stand as they are before the Lord; therefore think not your selves to be above what you are, least whilst you think that you are something, you prove nothing, and so deceive your selves; fore there is a groaning felt in you under the bondage of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and unto that doth the breathings of life reach, that the heavy burden might be undone, and the oppressed set free, which in you is pressed as a cart that is full of sheaves, &amp; by you in bondage kept, for unto the Lord of life are you found ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and fighting against him, and hates to be reformed by him, though long he hath striven with you, and now is the Lord God holding forth plenteous Redemption, and making known his salvation, and in his good &amp; perfect gift is visiting all people, that all may turn unto the light, and come out of darkness and depart from evil, which is made manifest in the light, and so come to feel the Redemption of of God in your selves, and the operation of his Spirit which worketh the work of God, and bringeth forth fruit unto holiness, for as in sin you abide, you are not redeemed, neither knows Christ nor the working of his power, but abides in the unbelief and in darkness, and brings forth unfruitful works thereof, the imagination of your hearts being alwayes evil, and that you love, and hates the light which doth reprove, and will not come to it, which doth as truely work in power as it is believed in, as ever it did in ages

past, and salvation is as truly felt in the leadings of the light, as they felt it who declared of it, and were called out of darkness into it; so it is of concernment unto every one to prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that the pure rejoycing you may have in your selves and not in another, for the Lord God is visiting all in the light, and hath given a manifestation of the Spirit unto every man to profit withall, then the gift of God you are not to neglect in your selves, but are to take heed unto it, and every motion of it, that your minds may be ordered in it, and lead by it to the knowledge of the living God, whom to know is life eternal, and none did ever come to the knowledge of him, but as they was turned to the light, and heeded the light which shone in their hearts, in which the knowledge of his glory is manifest in the face of Christ; and do you think to come to the knowledge of God by another way, be ye tryed in this ye Priests and Professors and all people, if the knowledge of the true God you be come unto, whom to know is eternal life, are you come to know this, or are you not in that knowledge which can never come to know the true God? be honest with your selves all of you, and see if you become to that in wch the knowledge of his glory hath been revealed from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for now it is the same as ever it was, and it changeth not, but is witnessed through ages and generations to be always the same, without any variableness, for that which <hi>Abel</hi> was guided by, and in which he offered up a sacrifice in righteousness, the same guided <hi>Noah,</hi> and in it he preached righteousness, the same appeared unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and he believed in it and was guided by it, and rejoyced to see it and it was counted unto him for righteousness, and in this was secrets revealed unto the Prophets, <hi>Moses</hi> lived in it, and by the manifestation of it was the Creation opened to his understanding, and he saw to the beginning, and so declared in the openings of life, and all the holy men of God were inspired by it, and gave forth the Scriptures in the motion of it, he that hath ears to hear let him hear, for this was a perfect guide unto all that believed in it before writings was, and all the words that are written, do bear witness unto the word which was in the beginning with God, and it was God, and they had all Redemption by him, and salvation in him who believed, and this was a guide unto the righteous from the beginning, and would you have another guide now? you have lost that which guides holy

Consider of this, for there is not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rule besides Christ who is given for a Leader, that he may be Salvation unto the ends of the earth; therefore all come unto him, and in his light believe, that you may feel his power to work in the inward parts and purifie your hearts, for there is a measure given unto every one of you, that doth reprove you in secret as your minds be after evil, be ye turned unto it, that you may feel the work of it, to cast off the weight that lyeth upon you, and the sin that so easily besets you, that the seed out of bondage may arise and come forth; for as the light is believed in, so is the power felt, to rend the vail and scatter the clouds, and makes mountains fall and hills melt, and is dreadful to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all the <hi>Egyptians</hi>; he that is wise in heart may read how he is acquainted in his own particular with the operation of Gods Spirit, for Redemption is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully revealed in this present age as in times past, and many bear true witness of it, who hath felt his power that worketh in the day, who hath made known his Salvation, and revealed his glory, and brought many sons and daughters unto it, where they know the truth that maketh free, and are redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from the earth, and saved by the Lord, and their minds are after heavenly things, and they worship God day and night in his Temple, and gives glory unto him that sits upon the Throne and unto the Lamb for ever and ever; and this is the true birth that is born of God, whose Image is heavenly, and he works the work of God, and all that believe in him
