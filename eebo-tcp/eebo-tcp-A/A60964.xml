            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE HONOURABLE Mr. Charles Boyl.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THERE's no Condition can subsist wholly upon itself: And I am bound to depend, as every Man, more or less, is, upon the Favour of the World, to carry him through the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Iourney of this Life: Nor do I think it my Misfortune to wait upon a Great Man's rising sometimes, to put him in mind of me. While I can keep my self out of the necessity of flattering Fools, I shall not very much repine at my Condition. I'm sure I'm safe here, because you are safe every where: And when a common Consent encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages an Opinion, I shall hardly be thought in the wrong, to do as other People do.</p>
            <p>Sir, when Poetry becomes, a Man's Business, 'twill hardly prove ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's Diversion: Tho' a Play once a Year, looks very like turning into the Profession, I am a little better acquainted with the Town, than to impose my self this way upon 'em; and let it be the defence of my Writing, that I have nothing else to do.</p>
            <p>I know Play-Writers, like Men of other Employments, where the Honest Advantages are so small, are suspected in their Dealings, of indirect, underhand Practices, to carry on their Trade. For my part, Sir, I propose nothing more than an opportunity of declaring myself in my turn, that I have grown up by degrees, with the general Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and Iudgment of the Town, into a Respect and Honour that every body has for you: This, Sir, is the only way I have of Publishing mine: and Writing has always been allow'd of, when there was no other way left of discovering the Passion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50805:3"/>Some Convenience, and a great deal of Pleasure, first carry'd me into this wanton way of Wickedness, (those old Seducers, Profit, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure) that have brought at last a great many of both Sexes, into the common Entertainment of the Town.</p>
            <p>I have had my ends of this Play, and shou'd have been glad if it had answer'd every Bodies: I think it has its Beauties, tho' they did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon the Stage, and 'tis not the smallest Commendation, to be able to divert you in private.</p>
            <p>If I run into the Course of a Dedication, I shall be lost in the Character of Mr. <hi>Boyl;</hi> for when I have said all I can, I shall fall short of every Man's Opinion; and no body, but your self, will think I can say enough of you: At home, or abroad; in the Camp, or in the Court, Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi>'s Behaviour, and Address, is the Pattern of every Gallant Man's imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so much, that, from what I have seen, and heard of you, I must believe that there is no Province of Humanity, but, at one time or other of your Life, you are design'd to Command. Let it satisfie, Sir, your present Ambition, to Conquer in the fairest Field of Victory, to Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in the Court, and in spight of the Cabals, and whispers of the Drawing-Room, to be universally allow'd the fine Gentleman: Which as it seems the easiest, has always been thought the hardest Character of a Great Man to maintain.</p>
            <p>Sir, since the distance of your Quality, and Fortune, has made it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to come near you, as a Friend, I hope you will allow me to wait upon you as,</p>
            <closer>

            <stage>Spoken by Mrs. <hi>Barry.</hi>
            </stage>
            <l>THey who must write (for writings a Disease)</l>
            <l>Shou'd make it their whole study how to please:</l>
            <l>And that's a thing our Author fain wou'd do;</l>
            <l>But wiser Men, than he, must tell him how:</l>
            <l>For you're so changeable, that every Moon,</l>
            <l>Some upstart whimsie knocks the old ones down.</l>
            <l>Sometimes bluff Heroes please by dint of Arms:</l>
            <l>And sometimes tender Nonsense has its Charms:</l>
            <l>Now Love, and Honour strut in buskin'd Verse:</l>
            <l>Then, at one leap, you stumble into Farce.</l>
            <l>Like true Fanaticks, never long content</l>
            <l>With any setled Form of Government:</l>
            <l>Eager in choice, as eager in forsaking;</l>
            <l>You first blaspheme the Gods of your own making.</l>
            <l>Let Poets henceforth lay their Rules aside;</l>
            <l>And take some ruling Planet for their Guide:</l>
            <l>No more frequent their fam'd <hi>Parnassus</hi>'s tops;</l>
            <l>Unless it be to place their Teliscopes:</l>
            <l>For such as hope to merit your esteem,</l>
            <l>Must quit their <hi>Horace,</hi> and erect a Scheme.</l>
            <l>Thus they may find a way to please the Pit,</l>
            <l>Provided they insure their Plays from Wit.</l>
            <l>Our Author, this way doubtless of Success,</l>
            <l>(For some Men have no Stars, as <hi>Lilly</hi> says)</l>
            <l>Himself, and Play, upon the Boxes throws,</l>
            <l>From perfect Beauty's, to imperfect Beaus.</l>
            <l>To you, fair Sirs (for I must call you so,</l>
            <l>Since Art, in spight of Nature, makes a Beau)</l>
            <l>Who in side Box, in seeming Iudgment sit,</l>
            <l>Like Barron-Tell-Clocks to attend the Pit;</l>
            <l>In all humility he does submit.</l>
            <l>Not that he needs to doubt you for his Play:</l>
            <l>We know your Courage lies another way.</l>
            <l>Nor will he Court you, like some servile Elves,</l>
            <l>Who flatter you as much, as you your selves:</l>
            <l>Let them proclaim the Conquest of your looks;</l>
            <l>That bug-bear word shall never burn his Books.</l>
            <l>You, Ladys, he adores, and owns your Charms,</l>
            <l>More powerful, than the greatest Monarchs Arms.</l>
            <l>Hopes the kind Heav'ns will all your Wishes grant,</l>
            <l>Whether they be for Husband, or Gallant:</l>
            <l>Nay, <hi>Bath,</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> at once, if both you want.</l>
            <l>Not doubting your good Nature for a Man,</l>
            <l>Who, to oblige you, does the best he can.</l>

                     <p>Why there's the Devil on't: One Night, about that time, she lost her Money, and I was lucky: She, to my Face, cry'd up the Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of those, who make their Friends partakers of their good Fortune: And I was too well satisfied with mine to contradict her: Next Morning, she sent to speak with me; on earnest Business, which was, to borrow 500 Guinny's; promising to repay me; with such a Grace, that no one, who had not the Honour to know her Ladyship, cou'd have had the Heart to refuse her.</p>

                     <p>I told her, mine was a Younger Brother's Fortune; not to be ventur'd but on good Security; she indeed kindly proffer'd me the best she had about her.—</p>

                     <p>Wou'd it were always to be her Husband.</p>
                     <p>That a Woman, at Eighteen, an Age, when Love, and Pleasure us'd to rule, shou'd in the midst of Plenty, value her self upon the Reputation of a Publican, and always sit at the Réceit of Custom!

                     <p>I consider the Principles of a Mistress, no more than of a good Companion, they are both the Instruments of pleasure for the time; and to be trusted with nothing beyond that meeting.</p>

                     <p>But I became the manage so well, that I verily believe I had been in the Army, but for one thing—</p>

                     <p>Why, they said Riding too much wou'd teach me to turn in my Toes, and spoil my Dancing; and you know a Body wou'd not do that for less than a Regiment; and they offered me but a Troop. Was you at the Play last Night?</p>

                     <p>If he wins, he'll scorn to carry any thing out of the Company; some of the</p>

                     <p>Then he can do you no Injury, either in your Quiet, or your Fame: For you can no more be in Love with him, (which is a great Blessing in these Affairs) than the Town can think, you ever allow'd him, to be in Love with you, and is not a Thousand Pound, a round Summ, for doing so little, and suffering nothing?</p>

                     <p>Sir; I won't be suspected, I won't be enquired into: A Husband can do no more; and I have enough of one Husband and his ill humours at home, I thank you, ever to allow of a Husband abroad to torment me. Perhaps you think I can't break with you; I wou'd have you to know, Sir, I can, and will break with you and fifty more, rather than break one hours rest for any of you. I'll change as often as I shift my Cloaths, but I'll light upon a Man that has sense enough to value his own pleasure, without invading mine. If I depended upon you indeed, and there were no body else to be had, you might tye me to your own terms, but, make us thankful, there's roving room enough in this dear Town: I can provide my self, I warrant you.</p>

               <hi>S</hi>EE the Effects of a poor Maids Last Pray'r,</l>
            <l>Driv'n by meer want of Husband to despair.</l>
            <l>And Ladies, in a Barren Age as this is,</l>
            <l>'Tis hard for all of us to have our Wishes.</l>
            <l>She, for a time pretended to a Wit;</l>
            <l>And yet you see her Project wou'd not hit:</l>
            <l>Let her Example teach you; there's no urging</l>
            <l>These Sparks, to take an Antiquated Virgin</l>
            <l>They fear the growing Cares of Marry'd Lives,</l>
            <l>And venture—only on their Neighbours Wives.</l>
            <l>Be Wise in time, set not too great a value</l>
            <l>On your fine selves, and still stand, shall I, shall I.</l>
            <l>For while the Dreams of Coach and Six deceive you,</l>
            <l>The honest Squire, despis'd, may chance to leave you:</l>
            <l>And when poor Maids are driven to Petition,</l>
            <l>We seldom find they better their Condition</l>
            <l>Yet thus with some of you it daily happens,</l>
            <l>You lose the Beast, in hopes to get the Trappings.</l>
            <l>You scorn to stoop below a Top Gallant:</l>
            <l>And all pretend to Ride the Elephant:</l>
            <l>As if you had forgot the thing you want.</l>
            <l>Tho' each lost hour you pass a Fiery Tryal,</l>
            <l>And ne'er refuse without a self-denial.</l>
            <l>Led by the Custom of the Sex, you strive</l>
            <l>To blind the World, while you your selves deceive:</l>
            <l>You may pretend a nice indifference;</l>
            <l>But Truth must still be Truth, while Sense, is Sense:</l>
            <l>Disguise your Inclinations as you can:</l>
            <l>Yet every Woman's Business is a Man.</l>
