            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The Councell of Husbandry hath ordered, that the twentieth part of every mans goods that dieth ſhall be employed about the improving of lands, and making of High-wayes faire, and bridges over Rivers; by which meanes the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is become like to a fruitfull Garden, the High-wayes are paved, and are as faire as the ſtreets of a Citie; and as for Bridges over Rivers, they are ſo high, that none are ever drowned in their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels.</p>
               <p>Alſo they have eſtabliſhed a law, that if any man holdeth more land than he is able to improve to the utmoſt, he ſhall be admoniſhed, firſt, of the great hinderance which it doth to the Common-wealth. Secondly, of the prejudice to himſelfe; and if hee doe not amend his Husbandry within a yeares ſpace, there is a penalty ſet upon him, which is yeerely doubled, till his lands be forfeited, and he baniſhed out of the Kingdome, as an enemy to the common-wealth.</p>
               <p>In the Councell of Fiſhing there are lawes eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, whereby immenſe riches are yeerly drawne out of the Ocean.</p>
               <p>In the Councell of Trade by Land there are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Lawes, ſo that there are not too many Tradeſmen, nor too few, by enjoyning longer or ſhorter times of Apprentiſhips.</p>

               <p>Very eaſily: for the Divines, by reaſon that the Societie of Experimenters is liable to an action, if they ſhall deliver out any falſe receit, are not troubled to trie concluſions, or experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but onely to conſider of the diverſitie of natures, complexions, and conſtitutions, which they are to know, for the cure of ſoules, as well as of bodies.</p>

               <p>I know divers Divines in England that are Phyſicians, and therefore I hold well with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and I would that all were ſuch, for they have great eſtimation with the people, and can rule them at their pleaſure?</p>

               <p>Very eaſily: for they have a law, that if any Divine ſhall publiſh a new opinion to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, he ſhall be accounted a diſturber of the publick peace, and ſhall ſuffer death for it.</p>

               <p>You are deceived; for if any one hath conceived a new opinion, he is allowed everie yeere freely to diſpute it before the Great Councell; if he overcome his Adverſaries, or ſuch as are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be Opponents, then it is generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for truth; if he be overcome, then it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be falſe.</p>

               <p>It is holden a principall policie in State to allow to the miniſters of State, Judges, and chiefe Officers, great revenues; for that, in caſe they doe not their dutie, in looking to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes ſafety, for conſcience ſake, yet they may doe it for feare of looſing their owne great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</p>

               <p>The Great Councell heareth no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, but againſt Miniſters of State, Judges, and chiefe Officers; theſe, being ſure to bee trounſed once a yeare, doe never, or very ſeldome offend: So that their meeting is rather a feſtivity, than a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

               <p>This would doe the feat, but that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in England, having not the skill of Phyſick, are not ſo highly eſteemed, nor beare ſo great a ſway as they doe in <hi>Macaria.</hi>

               <p>I will propound a book of Husbandry to the high Court of Parliament, whereby the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome may maintaine double the number of people, which it doth now, and in more plenty and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, than now they enjoy.</p>

               <speaker>Sch.</speaker>
               <p>That is excellent: I cannot conceive, but that if a Kingdome may be improved to maintaine twice as many people as it did before, it is as good as the conqueſt of another Kingdome, as great, if not better.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Trav.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, it is certainly better; for when the Townes are thin, and farre diſtant, and the people ſcarce and poore, the King cannot raiſe men and money upon any ſudden occaſion, without great difficulty.</p>

               <p>Were I a Parliament man, I would labour to have this book to bee diſpatched, the next thing that is done; for with all my ſeven Liberall Arts I cannot diſcover, how any buſineſſe can bee of more weight than this, wherein the publike good is ſo greatly furthered; which to further, we are all bound by the law of God, and Nature.</p>

               <p>Indeed there are many Divines of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, but I can ſhew an hundred Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which doe plainly prove, that ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation ſhall come before the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>Yea, I have read many plaine Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to that purpoſe, but when I ſearched the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors, I found that they did generally expound them myſtically.</p>

               <speaker>Trav.</speaker>
               <p>There be naturall cauſes alſo to further it; for the Art of Printing will ſo ſpread knowledge, that the common people, knowing their own rights and liberties, will not be governed by way of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
