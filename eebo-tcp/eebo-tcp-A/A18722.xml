            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And now indeede for that diuers (of disdainfull disposition) doo or may hinder the good reporte
<pb facs="tcp:5218:3"/>
of those labors which I thinke well bestowed among my freends, I haue set forth while I am liuing a great number of my works in this booke named my Challenge, that after my death shalbe witnesses they were mine owne dooings: not for any great matter in them, but for the iustnes of troth and true triall of all my honest exercises, and so to purchase cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and the more freends and fauourers to prop vp my poore reputation: I not only dedicate this booke (and all therein) to your honor, but haue made also in the same booke diuers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications to sundry honorable and worshipfull personages, protesting that there is nothing heerein but came from mine owne deuice, which inuencions (spoken as becomes me) shal be in all honest sorte defended by pen or any way I may to the vttermost of my breath or abilitie, ioying much (with all gladnes of hart) that they are presented to so honourable a personage and one of such singuler learning, whose worth and value by a worthy and vertuous Princes is seene into, and throwly considered of, which gracious Queene hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies made her princely choice in such an excellent and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable maner, as God himselfe should deuinely appoint and direct to our great wealth and his great glory: and in whose r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now good sir vnder your excellent fauour and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, I shielde my presumption and boldenes, that hath offred a booke of so many discourses, to the iudgement of such a multitude that quickly can discouer the weakenes of my labors: but hauing ventured so farre as to publishe them in print, I must now of necessitie commit them to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion of the world. So in hope the best will fall out, I present you with my studies and take leaue of your honor, desiring of God what goodnes can be wished, to be alwaies at your commaundement.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ood Reader, if my presumption were so great that I thought my booke might passe without your fauourable iudgement, mine error were as much as my ouer-weening: and yet to vse perswasions in purchasing your good liking, I should passe the bounds of common reason, and fall into the danger of adulation: for your good wils are rather won with good matter then bare wordes, and say what I can to gaine your affection toward my worke, you will speake what seemeth best in your owne conceites. For among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousands are many of deepe consideration, and some vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of as shallow iudgement: so that the one or the other cannot nor will not be led and caried away with any deuice of my pen, though all the hye spirits and excellency of Poetry might drop out of the quill I writ withall: wherefore now I must as well abide the hazard of your censure, as I haue boldely vnfolded my selfe to the worlde: there is now no crauing of pardon, nor pleading for your furtherance to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease my good fame: my works must abide waight, they are thrust into the ballance, and I of necessitie must content me with your allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and what price pleaseth you to set on my marchandise: but if they proue too light in the skales, I pray you helpe them with some graine of good skill, that they be not condemned as trifles, because they haue cost me great labour and study, and put me to no little charges. I freely offer them to you for three or foure causes, the one to keep the reputation of a writer, the second to pleasure my freendes with the reading of new inuentions, and thirdly to desire my foes to giue me true reporte of those workes I haue made, and last of all to affirme that euery thing in this my booke of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge is mine owne dooing, which iustlye no man can deny.
<pb facs="tcp:5218:4"/>
Not boasting thereof as matter worthy memory, but claiming a better regarde then enuy would giue me, I stand to the praise or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise of all I haue done, maruelling much that in my life time any one would take from me the honest laudation I deserue. I striue no further in that point, but commit to God and good people the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency and iustnes of my cause, and the best is (which shall beare it selfe) the wise of the worlde and worthiest of knowledge and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, are the only Iudges shall yeeld me my right: the rest are but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and lookers on, whose voices may make a great noise, but giues so vncertaine a sound, they can doo no great harme, because of nature and condition they neuer doo no great good. Now my pleading time is past, my booke must appeare in that bare fashion as I haue formed the matter, I hope it shall not walke so nakedly abroade, but shalbe able to abide the coldenes of ill will, and the extreame heate of hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mens disposition. God the giuer of goodnes, guide my verses so well that they neuer happen into their hands that loues me not, and make my prose and plainenes of speech be as welcome to the Reader, as it was well ment of the writer. So with double and treble bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, Farwell.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I was reading in the delightfull dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of <hi>Ieronimus Cardanus</hi> his comforts, among many pleasant pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages and speciall sentences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I founde that he said <hi>A man was but his mind</hi> either in the value of vertue or vanity of vice. So waying the worth of that conclusion, &amp; knowing that Manhood or Cowardize consistes in the selfe same opinion of the minde, I considered that common quarrels and priuate reuengement of Iniuries receiued, proceeded in a manner from this spring and flowing Fountaine, that euer is fedde and nourished with som setled conceite or other. For the minde is so noble, watchfull, and worthy, that it is neuer vnoccupied whilest the man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken, nor taketh any great rest when the body is a sleepe, (as some dreames and visions manifesteth plaine.) For euen as a cunning Carpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter or Smith, is hammering and heawing some péece of wood or iron, to bring the same to such shape and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as the artificer would haue it: So the minde (the harber of all secretes and mouer of all good and bad motions) can at no season be idle or wax weary of deuises. The Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof are so many, and the innumerable conceites therein are so mighty, the fire is of such vehement heat and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it must néedes burne or consume any thing that long remaines in it, so the minde is of such force and power, that it leadeth the man any way it listeth, and shapes al the sences and vitall spirites in what forme or fashion it pleaseth. For the longer the fancies of the head (by rouling to and froe are tired) and at length reposeth themselues in the constantnes of the minde, the more is the mans reason subiect to the mindes reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and the lesse strength the iudgement hath when it féeles the forces of the body captiuated and compeld to obay the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the minde. Though learning, education, and good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, be a meane and restraint, that a peruerse mind shall not draw the whole body to destruction, yet the minde being

bent to some dangerous determination, hath ouercome all the good causes rehearsed, and brought both the body, reputation, and life, into a shamefull disorder, and made a cruell confusion not onely of the man, but likewise brought a licentious liberty to the minde, experience of proud practises hath proued this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument no fable, but now to talke truely and probably of the minde, what can be named or thought on, (if they be things to be executed) but the minde dare attempt and the man may goe about, it dare aduenture the hazarde of the soule, the losse of life and goods, and the cracking of estimation and credit, if any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed mischiefe hale the minde forewarde to some odious enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises, this showes but a weakenes of Iudgement, naughtines of nature, and a most wicked and wilfull disposition of a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate conceite, diuelishly drawen and enclined and carelesly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>But now to touch the noblenes of an inuincible minde, that neither Fortune can conquer, power may commaund, nor worldly pompe nor wealth can winne. The true discourse of this minde, craues a writer of a higher knowledge, for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable spirite that keepes life, and breatheth continuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy in the brest where this minde makes his mansion house, is to be explained and set forth by the profoundest pen man of the worlde, that can lay open like an Anotomy the hidden and secrete partes of the body, especially the diuine nature (closed vp in flesh and bloud) and secrecy belonging to the vertue of this manly and valiaunt minde. Some men there are (and though they boast not much the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber may be great) that with a strong heart can suffer afflictions, beare burthens, abide disgraces, and in their most torments seeme careles of all the crossings &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchecks is offered them, yet they are armed within to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand all outward assaults as it were a fortresse manned with souldiers and munition, throughly to defend it selfe against the power of Princes, &amp; practises of warlike people, yea as they in peace can vse this approued patience, so in the hottest broiles of

For now a dayes men may not meete without snarring, lostie lookes, bitter wordes, haughty fashions, and froward behauioure, on which stoutnes of stomacke, malice is kindled, contention is breed, and quarrells are set abroach. The accustomed curtesie, sweete conuersation, freindle gentlenes, humane manners, and ciuile humblnes in our common societie, is almost forgotten, brought in contempt, and put out of exercise (if Noble Parsonages shew it not) and in place of the commendable vertues are corrupt conditions and newfangled vices closely crept, to the great disquietnes of many, and commoditie of no one person.

A prettie quarrell that compells men to bée fugitiues, for playing of beastly parts and bringeth such repentaunce as breedeth both beggerie and extremitie of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and namely when friends shall forsake you, and weeping can not helpe. For whilst law persecuteth the offender, the world is like a Laborinth, &amp; endles is the labor and trouble of that bodie that thinks euery man follows him.</p>
               <p>In the olde world when swords of one length and heartes of equal courage did meet, some in differencie debated the matter, and fewe were put to foile, and many were worthely esteemed for their value. And now when the rapier and dagger dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth a man quickly, neither he liues to heare his owne fame, nor no man liuing can let fall a good word of the quarrell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun of such trifles, maintaind with such terror, and ended with such madnes, not so manly as miserable nor so much praised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the fool hardy, as condemned in the consideration of the wise. And so to come to the right order of manhood, courage, valiancy, and stoutnes of heart, it lieth more in the Iudgement
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:5218:37"/>
then in the iarring, in the fortitude then in the forwardnes, and restes more in the modesty then in the malice. For anger of it selfe is but a sencelesse monster, an vnreasonable rage, a furious franzie, a distemperate imperfection, a priuy passion of choller, and an open enemy of life. The discouerer of the frailty and naughty nature of man, and the discredite of as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as cannot maister that outragious disease of the minde.</p>
               <p>Then how should the fury of mallice bring forth any other fruict, but such a pestiferous fire, as shall consume the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of hatred, and the last reuengers of wretched wroth.</p>
               <p>For reuenge is like a winde ball the more it is stricken (and remembred with force of hand) the higher it mountes, &amp; makes the more rebound, so that endlesse becomes a quarrell, so long as the exercise of mallice is had in vre, and men with euill disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion goe about to store vp mischiefe.</p>
               <p>Now is to be decided euery degrée and manner of a quarrel, and to shew how and in what sort an vniust quarrell may bee offered, and a iust quarrel may be taken, both by law of armes and nature, and by a vsuall custome and manner among men, prouing by antiquities and art military, the matter purposed to treat vppon so that with patience you here out that may bée spoken.</p>
               <p>As it is vnfit for a Gentleman (that stands on reputation) to play the ruffian and roister, so it is most vncomely for him to stoupe so lowe, as any way to abase his good calling, with the bad conditions of a rude and rusticall fellowe, by which prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue the match is vnmeete, the quarrell may be refused, the strife hath no equality, nor no honesty is gotten in brawling with inferiors or fighting with men of so small temperancy and credit, but because most stoutnes and courage (with hazard of life is betweene Gentlemen) and trifles not taken vp growe to great busines, their quarrels are most requisite to be spoken of, redressed, corrected, and brought to better order.</p>
               <p>First yée shall finde among Souldiers, (that are of greate mindes) a kinde of stately consideration in all quarrels they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:5218:38"/>
take in hand. They taking vppon them in the art military (which well becomes their calling) to maintaine honour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their countrey and credite, and to fight in no quarrell but Princes right and their owne honest causes, haue set downe by certaine cerimonies, what wordes may touch them, what manner of men they may deale withall, what occasions may force a combate, what scope &amp; liberty pertaines to a iust quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and what restraines a manly minde from doing iniury to others or harming himselfe.</p>
               <p>On which resolution the Souldier sets vp his rest, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly hazards the winning or loosing, of as great thing as life may be worth, not with presumption procured to this danger, but with estimation of his honor haled forewarde (by daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of enemy) to leaue good example to those that comes after him.</p>
               <p>But beholde how this aduenture happeneth, regard the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of this hazard, way well what difficulty is aboute the matter, and marke the chiefe points (and groundes of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage) that breedeth busines, and bringeth forth a combate.</p>
               <p>Then must be noted, a simple Souldier (or mercenary man) may not challenge a Captaine, a meane Captaine or Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may not challenge a Corronell, a Corronell (though lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a regiment) may not challenge a Lord Marshall of the Field, a Lord Marshall (hauing charge of life and death) may not challenge the Lord Lieutenant of the Army.

And yet all these degrees (as their office and honour is) one after another, may without reproche refuse in euery place, the daungering of their liues by priuate quarrell, &amp; not meeting one another by chance (whereon may busines growe) looke what so euer be passed,

(villany excepted) There is no kinde of preiudice to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but mallice may surcease, and society may reuiue friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and quietnes should of all hands be sought.</p>
               <p>Now of matter ministred in despight, spoken to strike dead good name vttered for offence and brauery, let fall to disgrace any person, and maintained with threatnings (daring and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther open iniu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then must be considered, the cause of those spéeches, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons credite that spake it, &amp; in what presence and place the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury was offered, for some places are of such honour, that no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonestye may bee suffered in, and some person that speakes iniuries in base company (out of honourable presence) the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers meane calling aunsweres himselfe, for wise men ought to make no more account of a badde fellowes babble, then of the barking of an olde dog, whose teeth are gone and can not bite. An all the common kinde of iniuries are but as men do imagine them, as scoulding of a co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>queane, railing of a ruffian, taunting of a tosseblade, frumping of fine fellowes, and the brags and threatning of a varlette, all these shamelesse rabble and sencelesse sort of shadowes, are of so small substaunce and credite, that their voices makes but a noise in the aire, like a thunder cracke, that neither brings raine, nor argues any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant winde and weather.</p>
               <p>There is besides these ordinary causes, (and crooked conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of people) a number of naughty natures, that neuer will be quiet in countenaunce nor wordes, but either with skrowling like conquerors, or skorning like vices on a stage, they striue with counterfaite courage to ouercome Lions, and to be more terrible then Tigres, snuffing and puffing as all the worlde were too little to containe their great lookes, and disdainefull monstrous manners.</p>
               <p>And their tongues are so talkatiue (and filled with follies) that none may speake but themselues, on whose prowde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:5218:39"/>
are many mad disputes wilfully begon and moste wickedly ended. To contend with those glorious Images, is as a man shoulde sound a Trumpet at the roaring of euery bul.</p>
               <p>Thus with extraordinary manners, new fangled fancies, olde stubburne nature, and fresh fine cunning, that wisedome condemneth, a good minde may be ouerreached, and a quiet man may be brought in some quarrelous brabble, for the sight and sufferaunce of these shadowes, (whose substance is all in boasting) and the society or contention with such counter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aite conquerors, is an open enemy to all the good dispositions of men, and a priuy worker of disquietnes to those that beholdes and heares any peece or iote of those vices before rehearsed, for nothing bréedes more mislike, or offendeth so much euery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as the continuall brags and audacious manners of the vnbrideled multitude, who are neuer free from quarrels, voide of villany, nor without naughty brabbles a number.</p>
               <p>Come now to generall occasions in Court, Countrey towne and so foorth, but principally of Court we ought to haue great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est regard, where not only the Prince hold residens with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall maiestie, but likewise by absolute power commaunds obedience, &amp; restraynes Courtiars many wayes from offering of iniuries. For plainely to speake, in Chamber of presence or any place neere (or about a Princes pallace) mens tongues are tyed either to kéepe silence, or ciuilly with reuerence to vse comly wordes, méete for such a place, and voyde of villanye or vicious intents, chiefely of quarrels that may moue mischiefe, and stirre vp disquietnes among the gentle Bees assembled together in a Hiue for the honoring of their king, and publique profite of their estate. The Court is no Cocke-pit to croe in, no shraep for cocking, no seat to be saucy in, no place of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor no soile for brawlers and braggers, that haue currish conditions, and knowes not their duety, but rather a place of royall dignity, princely entertainements, curteous behauiors, and fine and friendly fashions, that with orderly manner may set forth a Princes regality. And though there some one (wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:5218:39"/>
temperance) rashly behaue himselfe and with warme wordes sturre the coales of a wicked quarrell, mens dueties in generall, (by wisedome) should either quench the heat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or cast imbers on the fire, that the fury and flame should not burst out there, nor be disputed of any other where to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of that place, and looke what is offered in open hearing or secret whispering (that may sow seedes of dissention) shoulde be trodden vnder foote, or passed ouer with sporting, among the best iudgements, for feare least a little braunch of spite doe sproute vp on some rash spéeches, and grow out of order, both past remedy, and beyond the bounds of good manner.</p>
               <p>If men in Court were as carefull to keepe peace, as they are desirous to créepe in credite, or common society should attende to no other purpose, but to familiar behauior, friendly affection, brotherly loue, and blessednes of life, you shall behold a mutuall agreement among all kinde of creatures at their first méeting, the birds with their like flées and feedes together, and in theyr manner vse a kinde of reioysing when they encounter one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea and taketh part with their fellowes against all that shall offend them, flocking and crying as they may together in multitudes, to shew their naturall inclination, and how they al doe suffer torment, by the disquietnes of one bird in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. The Bées séeing but one of their fraternity troubled or angry, fly all in a swarme on euery thing offends them, and vseth such fury for reuenge, that they sting and hum out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. The Beasts not onely agree in their fashion, but in like sort takes one anothers part vehemently: and chiefly the very Hogs ioyne in a battaile against those dogs that biteth them. The Fish in the floud swim in skulles arming themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their enemies, and you shall reade in <hi>Plinie</hi> that among the Dolphins was such amity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that a Dolphin being taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner by a King (and closely kept) there assembled such a number of Dolphins together as is incredible, and they neuer lefte mourning and playning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> showing by sorrowfull signes the dolour taken for the losse of their companion, by which meanes
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:5218:40"/>
they recouered him againe of the King.</p>
               <p>Thus if Fish, Fowle and Beast, agrée in vnion with a wonderful league of amity, men may blush to behold their own defects and Serpentine natures, that neuer rests hissing, sting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and casting out of venome, bred in vaine mindes, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in hatefull brests. The reason that man beareth, and the forme and shape of his noble creation, should be an euerlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remembraunce to moue him vnto quietnes, especially the renowne that is gotten by patience and fortitude, should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies kéepe reasonable men from rages, and be a bulwarke and target to beare of quarrels, the destruction of life, the hour glasse of death, and the whole consumer of all good credite.</p>
               <p>It is to be presupposed that prowd hearts growes so Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and euery one (that is quarrelous) would séeme a King or a conquerour, yet Princes take great aduisement before they breake peace, and cunningly put of causes of warre, waying the innumerable troubles, daungers, and losses that pertaines to a quarrell, but the generall number of men runs headlong into mischiefe, casting neither perill nor hazard, as all our life and fame, stood on slashing, cutting, roisting, and striuing for vain-glory. In our Elders daies fighters were called ruffians, and ruffians were so lothsome, that no honest man could abide their company. If seruing men which alwaies should be ciuile, had quiet &amp; sober maisters, such buckelers with pikes, such swords like spits, and such long great daggers should not bee worne The weapon and countenaunce (by maintainers of quarrels) may cause cowards to be bold, and cause corage to catch copper or creepe closely in cornes. And now in the chiefe and highest degree of quarrelling, where see you iarres, questions, brawls, banding, and the rest of disorders, but where some party is ouer great (playing on aduantage) or weapons are not equall, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be among noble great mindes, whose valiauncy can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suffer iniury, nor abide any blemishe of honour. So euen now to them this worke is adressed, the baser sort néedes not my perswasions, nor but of good will and presumption, this nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:5218:40"/>
not I speake of. The whole world is fraught so full of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, that the least occasion can be ministred, bréedes such great busines, that quarrels are so common (the custome thereof so olde) it séemeth nothing straunge to beholde murthers, odious practises, shamefull poisnings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and miserable man slaughters.</p>
               <p>In Italy, a simple quarrell but once conceiued, neuer endes till death hath dispatched peraduenture both the parties, and so greedily they goe to take away life, that all the mischiefe can be imagined is put in exercises without delay, taking breath, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of God, feare of law, or shame of the world, so blouddy is the minde, the body sléepes not, till the handes haue done some abhominable outrage. The minde cannot bee in quiet, til open folly &amp; monstruous madnes haue disturbed the whole sences, and brought the life and body in hazard of hell fire, or daunger of worldly shame: these are the fruits of fury. The defects of nature, the miseries of man, and the brutish conditions of the counterfaite finesse in Italy. In Fraunce if a lie may bée brought in by circumstaunces, or a fine quarrell can be sifted out of grosse speeches,, present death followes, or perpetuall hatred is set abroach, wherein murthers are committed, and many a mischieuous act is taken in hand, odious to beholde, and a great horror to heare, but most vnchristianly executed.</p>
               <p>And so generally, in all countreys and kingdoms, a quarrell once begon, comes to butchery and bloudshed, and commonly growes after (in many generations and kindreds) to dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foed, and shamelesse slaughters.</p>
               <p>A quarrell in property &amp; nature, may be compared to many bigge barrels of Gun-powder, which once set on fire, flames so vehemently, that euery little corne thereof, is throughout con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, and the blast and busines it makes, ouerthrowes houses, beateth downe great buildings, and shakes a whole towne and the walles thereof in sunder. Yea euen as a tennis ball, the harder is stricken the further it flieth, and the oftner it reboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, the more he labors that strikes it: so a sparke of spitefull hatred, being blowen with the busy bellowes of mallice (that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:5218:41"/>
kindleth coales which can neuer be quenched) encreaseth such a smoothering smoke and fire, that burnes like the hill of <hi>Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> that neuer goeth out, nor wanteth heate, and fume to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a whole countrey.</p>
               <p>And one especiall point is alwaies to be noted (in the naughty nature of a quarrell) that whosoeuer hath done any iniury or giuen a wound or a blow, neuer can auoide daunger and vtter destruction, without some amendes made, crauing of pardon, open repentance, or secrete working of friends, that are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the long debating of the matter.</p>
               <p>As one good turne doth craue another, so an Iniury demands a quarrell, a quarrell bréedes a thousand offences, offences hardly can bee forgotten, and the more a wrong remaines in minde, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he lesse hope is of forgiuing the fault, and the more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe is put in proofe and exercise.</p>
               <p>And whosoeuer duely considers the ill inclination of people, he shall finde thousands so apt and ready to take in hand a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, that in some sort it is held a cowardise and a kinde of no courage to put vp a trifle, so many desires to sée bloudshed, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sets men agog in vnhappines, and so many goes about with tales and bad deuises, to stur vp strife and contention.</p>
               <p>Well since our imbecillity is much, our fury not little, and disposition so stout, that all thinges must be disputed of and dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to the vttermost degrée of dangerous quarrelling: I wish peraduenture vpon some experience, that mildnes might mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the manner of our falling out, and if nothing could qualifie the cruelty of courage, a regard of God, good reputation, iust cause, and honest dealing may be vsed, exhorting all men to looke to life, common society, mutuall loue, and the generall peace of a christian Kingdome. For how so euer the Worlde may imagine of fighting and brawling, the very route and grounde of disorder in a common wealth, is vnreasonable qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, wherein is maintained a kinde of Turkishe tyranny, and brutish boldnesse.</p>
               <p>This not spoken beyond the compasse of dutie, nor to the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:5218:41"/>
preiudice and hinderaunce of any mans manhood, which may bee as well seene, and vnderstood by the conquering of himselfe (and maistring his owne passions) as in hauing the victorie of others. Which triumph and victorie cannot bée gotten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great bloodshed and businesse.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N calling to minde, good Sir <hi>George,</hi> our méeting in Ireland a long while agoe for the seruice of the Quéenes Maiesty, your good brother then liuing (to whome I was bound in good will,) I penned at that instant by his meanes the life and death of a Pirate, and promised a further worke to your selfe, which now I performe, because your Souldiour-like dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is aunswered with the aduauncements of Fortune, and your ancient house and bloud is beautified with an honourable place, the Prince hath possest you of a signe and token as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that a noble Souldiers profession shall neuer goe out of your remembraunce, for the which cause, I haue dedicated this worke called <hi>The honor of a Souldier</hi> vnto your protection, in hope that which you haue séene and read for the commendation of Souldiers, shall be a sufficient testimony of their value and worthines, and shall not only procure you and others like your selfe to further their fame, but like wise willing to read that I haue set downe in their behalfe, for as briefely as my small Iudgement can discharge a true discourse thereof, with good probable reasons and auncient authors of famous credite.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:5218:48"/>I minde to expresse and set foorth at large, how Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours were made off, and honoured in times past: and what prerogatiue they hadde aboue other people. And to declare how Princes held them in admiration, and gaue them liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, titles, and dignities: farre beyond the rest of any, that liued vnder their lawes and obedience. And this by the waye is to bée thought, that all my former discourse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsall of warres, attended to no other purpose and effect, but for the aduauncement of Souldiours, and to bee as it were a foile to sette foorth the matter, I presentlye mind to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe out. For nowe I will in a manner shewe, howe Gentility beganne, and where and in what sort honour was first gotten and maintayned, which argument as I hope, shall not onely content the wise and well learned, but also please euery degrée, and make the simple sort plucke vp their coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and imitate (by some honest exercises) the liues of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Souldiers.</p>
            <p>I trust I néede not in this ready and ripe age (wherein good writers, great learning, and studious iudgements doth florishe) rehearse by particulars euery parcell and poinct, that belongeth to a Souldiers profession. Nor that you looke I should recite when, and where the <hi>Romanes, Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Athenians,</hi> and other nations, did preferre and extoll men of Marshall minds, and noble courages. For their books and Commentaries, and the innumerable Libraries of great antiquity, are the very recordes of my discourse, and remaine as mirrours for you to looke in. And shall proue a thousand partes more in the commendation of Souldiours, then either my penne or tongue (by sufficient cunning) hath power to expresse. For it can not be, that from a little gutte or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell of water, you should looke for so great a floud, as from a multitude of springes, from whence mighty Riuers takes ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall and recourse.</p>
            <p>And so I send you to the Welspring of knowledge (I mean
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:5218:48"/>
the auncient Fathers workes) to fetch true intelligence, of the thinges I make mention of, touching the worthy reputation of a good Souldiour, and the antiquity of his credite, triumph and glory.</p>
            <p>First, looke in the sacred Scriptures, and search from the death of <hi>Abell,</hi> comming downe orderly to the birth of Christ: And sée whether Souldiours were made of or no. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse you shall finde they were not onely embraced and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but likewise they are of a long continuance and credite. As all the Bible before <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptistes time declareth. And Christ himselfe in a sort did vtter, when he saide, he had not found such faith in Israell, as he saw in a Centurion. Yea and in the Apostles Actes, there is a speciall poinct to be noted. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout Souldiours were sent to <hi>Simon Tanners</hi> house to find out <hi>Peter.</hi> Well, now I committe you to the Scripture, and I will follow prophane Histories: &amp; begin at the very Infidels (a scorne for a Christian to be taught by) which are no small number, nor of no little continuance, people alwayes brought vp in war, and Princes of great fame, power, and auctority. Yea conquerours of the whole world, and Kinges to whom all people did stoupe and doe homage.</p>
            <p>These Paganes, or as we may terme them, lost shéepe, to whome the great Shepheard would not be knowen, (and yet among them tormented and crucified) did make such lawes and orders for Souldiers, as the Turke to this day obserueth, and holdeth in great reuerence. Regard but the liberties and auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority of the Ianessaries: and that shall manifestly proue, that men of warre are had in great admiration. But because you shall haue the more beliefe to the matter: read the life of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great: The Commentaries of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> and the noble actes and victories of a number of other notable Princes. And then assuredly you shall be perswaded, that the renowne of Soldiours hath reached, and spread as farre as fame can flie, or good report could haue passage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:5218:49"/>I pray you can any man deny, but it springeth of a great courage, and zeale to the common wealth: when a man forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the pleasure of life, to follow the painefulnesse of warre, and daunger of death: and refuseth no toile nor trauaile, to purchase credite, and attaine vnto knowledge. Yea some such we read of, as <hi>Marcus Cursius,</hi> and <hi>Mucius Sceuola,</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused no enterprises to doe their Countrey pleasure. Yea some haue sold their patrimony, and consumed their Treasure and riches, to enriche their Princes with glory, and euerlasting renowne.</p>
            <p>Were not this a madnes, and more then a méere folly, to be a drudge to the world, (and a labourer for those that sits at rest) and to watch and ward, fight, striue, and struggle with straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for victory: and then to come home and be rewarded as common persons, and walke like a shadow in the Sunne, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out estimation or countenance. Would any that had wisedome, vallue, and courage, be ouer runne with vicious fooles and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, or be made a footestoole to their inferiour, when they haue climed vp the steps of honour, and are gotten into the top gallant of worldly glory, and warlicke triumph.</p>
            <p>Among children that doe but play at the bucklars, there is a preheminence, and one will acknowledge the other to bée his better, when good bobbes are bestowed: and sodainely a stout taule lobber will lay downe the waster, and yéelde to him that hath more practise, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> not a man that hath coped with Champions, buckled with Conquerours, and abidden the hazard of the Canon, stand on his Pantoffelles, and looke to the steps he hath passed. Yes sure, and such a member of the state, (the baser sort are Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers) ought to be made of, deserueth place and preheminence, and is no companion for punies, nor méete to be matched with Milkesoppes, whose manhood and manners differs, as farre from the graue Soldiour, as a Donkite in courage and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on differs from a Ierfaukon.</p>
            <p>As the duetie to a mannes countrey, and the wages that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:5218:49"/>
hee taketh, bindes him to doe the vttermost he maie: so were there not an other cause, that forceth further matter. Full cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly some would fight, and full slowly some would march to the battell, albeit the Princes quarrell and wages receiued, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth much, and is a thing stoutly and wisely to be looked to. But I tell you, fame and reputation is the marke that men shoote at, and the gréedinesse of glorie and ambition, prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the mind so fast forward, that neither the man lookes vpon the multitude of enemies. Nor regards the daunger of death, so he may be eternized, &amp; liue in the good opinion of the Prince and people.</p>
            <p>For he that but bluntly lookes about him, and goeth to the warre for wealth (which hardly is there gotten) is led on with a couetous desire of that he shall not haue, and may fight like an Oxe, and die like an Asse. But who so respecteth his credite, and paiseth in ballaunce the worthynesse of fame, that riseth by well doing, doth combate like a Lion, and either conquers like a man, or dieth like a conquerour, as many great Kings &amp; Captaines haue done, whose ensamples (a long while agoe) as yet remaynes freshlye in memorie.</p>
            <p>It may bee thought that euery mercinarie man, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon hireling (taken vp for a while, or seruing a small season) is a souldier fit to be registred, or honoured among the renou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med sort of warlike people. For such numbers of <hi>bezoingnies</hi> or necessarie instruments for the time, are to fall to their occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation when the seruice is ended, and not to liue idlely, or looke for imbrasing. For neyther they tarry long in the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elde, when they are prest to go foorth. Nor are not often called againe to the like iourney, so great is our store of such persons: and so many shiftes they can make, to putte of any paine and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard. But hee is to bee accounted the couragious Souldier, that is giuen by his owne disposition, to delight and folow the Cannon wheele, whose countenaunce and chéerefull face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes to smile and reioyce when the Drumme soundeth, &amp; whose hart is so high, it wil not stoupe to no slauery. But hath a

A matter falling out well, worthye to be liked, but otherwise, a heauy tale to be told, and an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence bought with ouer much repentaunce.

            <p>If in the old time our Forefathers vsed their men of warre nobly, preferred them to promotions, &amp; dealt honourably with them that serued then Countrey, where warres were not so cruell. Why should not this world, wherein pollicies, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and bloodshed is followed (and hazards are meruelously escaped) to the vttermost of mans power, haue more regard to a Souldiour that shunneth no hazard, nor refuseth no perill.

               </gap>e for commoditie. Yea, such as serues at home, and cannot goe out of the view of a faire house, and smoke of a foule Chimney, snatcheth vp good turnes, and steales awaie preferments priuilie: when those that merites more consideration, oft goes openly a begging, and findeth few among thousands that wisheth them well, or doth them any good.</p>
            <p>Some say the cause of this hard happe to the one, and good Fortune to the other, is a certaine deadly dissention, fallen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the sword and the penne. By which mortall malice is bred and nourished in bosome, such a headstrong hatred and parcialitie, that the penne is euer giuing a dash out of order, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the commendation of the sworde, and the sword being disgraced, by a balde blot of a scuruie Goose quill, lies in a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken rustie scabberd, and so takes a Canker, which eates awaye the edge, and is in a manner lost for lacke of good looking to, and consideration of a painfull Cutler.</p>
            <p>And the penne (as many people are perswaded) is like the Pensell of a Painter, alwaies readie to set out sundrie colours, and somtime more apt to make a blurre, then giue a good shape and proportion to any inuention or deuise, that proceedes of a plaine meaning. And as all pensels are as well occupied of a bongling Paynter, as a cunning woorkeman. So the scribling Penne is euer woorking of some subteltie, more for the benefite of the Writer, then commonly for the profitte or pleasure of the Reader: yea, and the penne is waxt so fine, and can shew such a florishe, that a Mayster of Fence, though hée playde with a twoo hand Sworde, might bee put to a foule foyle: where the Penne is in place, and is guided by a

               </gap>, and a shrewde head.</p>
            <p>But vnder correcton, if a man may bee plaine, the Penne and the Sword can neuer agree, because the Penne standes in such feare of the sword, it would not come vnder the blow of the blade: &amp; the sword is in such doubt to bee moi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed with inke, by the dash of a penne, that it loues not to come where the pen may annoye it. And so the dissention and quarrell betweene the Penne and the Sworde, is neuer like to bee taken vp: the harmes are so great that growes on their amitie and méeting, and the aduauntage of them both is so much when they bee kept a sunder.</p>
            <p>For the Sworde is the best and in his most brauery when it is shyning in the fielde, where bloode may be shed, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour may bée wonne. And the Pen is in the chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fest pompe, when it lies lurking in the Towne, where pence may bée pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased, and peace and quietnesse may do what it please<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h. And the Pen is so glad to rest in the pennar, till profite cals him out, that hée cannot abide the hindrers of his commoditie, nor the disquieter of his ease. Which commeth by warres, and proceedeth from the Sword, when the Drum and the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet puts the penne out of credit.</p>
            <p>Now to speake roundly to the reason, may bee alledged in the Pens behalfe (and prayses of those that haue the vse of the same) it cannot bée denied, but the penne may both perswade warre, and purchase peace. And those that heere at home main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine good Lawes: sée iustice ministred, vpholde the publike state: plead controuersies at the barre, studie to vnfold doubtes. Labour at their Booke to bée profitable members, and striue dayly to excell in learning, and quiet the quarrellous people of their Countrey. Such I saye that with Pen or tongue, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunceth vertue, and ouerthrows vice, are méete to bée honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, deserueth great laude, and ought to goe in the rancke and place of commendation and dignitiye. For there is but foure sortes of true Nobilitie, or Gentlemen. The first Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, by whom all States and Kingdomes are guided,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:5218:52"/>
brought to know order, and made to possesse in quietnesse the goodes that eyther good Fortune, or sweate of browes hath gotten.</p>
            <p>The second are Souldiers, whose venter and valliance hath beene great, seruice and labour not little, and dayly defended with the hazard of their liues, the libertie of the Countrey.</p>
            <p>The thirde are vpright and learned Lawiers, that looke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h more to the matter they haue in hand, then the money they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. And are neuer idle in doing their duty, and studying for the quietnesse of matters in controuersie.</p>
            <p>The fourth are Marchants, that sayles forrain Countreys, and brings commodities home: and after great hazards abroad do vtter their ware with regard of conscience and profite to the publike estate.</p>
            <p>And as from the beginning Gouernours and Rulers were ordayned by God, and the rest of Gentilitie came in, and did follow as reason required, and desart did commaund. So an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient birth and blood (ioyned with good conditions) is a thing much to bee honoured and esteemed, and beautifies not only the noble race, but bringes likewise a treable beatitude, to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so vertuously bent and nobly borne.</p>
            <p>And as for the Souldiers and their originall, of honours, ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and calling, the <hi>Romaines</hi> (which were the Fathers of all Marshiall affaires, and Conquerors of the world) haue so much spoken of and praysed, that no man can denie, but they are the men of greatest antiquitie, and people that Princes first prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and gaue stippendes vnto. Yea, and the chiefest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours that euer were before our dayes: had a great glorye themselues to bee called Souldiours, and Noble Captaynes. For they thought none so worthie as the Souldier, nor none so meete to compare themselues vnto, as the man that stoode on his honour, and would neyther stoupe to no kinde of slauerye, nor yeelde to no villanous action.</p>
            <p>But in verie deede, to speake of euery one in their order, there is none <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o much to bee feared, loued, and honoured as the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:5218:53"/>
and Leaders of the common people.</p>
            <p>For the peaceable Gouernour, and such as are experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Wordly pollicies, knowes how to make warre, and howe to auoyde troubles: and as they are loth to fall from rest and wealth, to ruffeling Warre and wickednesse, that bréedes bloodshed and want: So they can breake the bandes of peace, and set men out to the field, when causes commaundes them, and oportunitie doth serue. But since that my purpose is but to treate of Souldiers alone, (and that I lacke skill to set foorth the rest) I will returne to my first Discourse and intent, and leaue the wise to consider, what good matter may bee sayde in the thing I leaue off.</p>
            <p>The Souldiour because his life is in ballaunce, and his death is at the dore, hath so many mischieues to passe, &amp; so few meanes to escape daunger: that he is compelled to be honest, and be rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy to make an accompt euery houre of the day. For as the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non may call him before he be aware, or the pollicie of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie may cut off his yeares: so is he assured that the pot, which goeth often to the water, comes home with a knock, or at length is passhed all in peeces. Through which accidents or crosse chances, he is held so harde, and curbed so shorte (if any feare of God be in his breast) that he hath no scope to runne at riot in: nor play the parts of a wanton, or prodigall sonne.</p>
            <p>Albeit some hold opinion, that Souldiours be giuen to spoile and offered to insolent life, by a number of inconueniences: yet may they so well bee occupied in warre, that they may bee occasion of great good, and a great hinderer of many harmes. For when houses are ready to be burnt, impote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t persons, poore women and children ready to bee slayne: they may saue what they list, and preserue an infinite number of thinges, that a man at home can doe no good in, nor none but the Souldiour in the fielde, hath power to comfort and succour. And for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tame I know Souldiours of that disposition, that hath beene occupied in these honest actions: when some Helhoudes haue beene spoyling and murthering, and founde by their follye
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:5218:53"/>
and ouer great cruelitye, a dispatch of their owne dayes, and peraduenture the terrible wrath of God, and damnation to their soules.</p>
            <p>My Prince maie bée well serued, and the Enemie not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to the vttermost persecuted: the Lesson that Sainct Iohn Baptist gaue the souldiours, may suffice for this matter, and carrie mens mindes from violence, and doing wrong, to quallifie furie, and maintaine right, with a regard to the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, that ought not to bée touched, for the offence of an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Leader, or one whose faultes the ignoraunt may not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers This point though simply it is passed ouer, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a large volume: and is to be looked into with a diuine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Christian consideration.</p>
            <p>Then if the souldiors (as few there are in number) be honest and is to be proued, they are not to be reproued: it followes that honor and reputation accompanies those souldiours, and that a singular priuiledge and libertie, may be had for those that haue such regard of their fame, that they wil do no any one thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudicial to their credite, in the compasse of which regard is knit, valiancy, modestie, pitty, &amp; hope of another life to come: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> affaires of this world shall dutifully and honestly be finished.</p>
            <p>And for that the reader hereof shal not thinke, but that great Princes thought their Souldiours to bee honest, &amp; men that were worthy the making of (whose doings &amp; regarde did argue and shew a speciall hope of another place to go to, or a certaine fame and credite heere to be maintained) I will shew you as I haue gathered by translation, how triumphant kings &amp; princely potentates, did ordaine, set downe, and deliuer a law &amp; rule for souldiours. By the which they had honor, libertie, &amp; prerogatiue aboue, and beyond the Commoners, or common course of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The translation I speake of is not long and tedious, but bringing willing mindes to heare &amp; know the truth you may read if leasure permit, and you peruse that followeth.</p>
            <p>First you must marke (and make a good note of) that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldes were at the beginning souldiours, and were called aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

            <p>In Fraunce, our néere neighbours makes so great account of Souldiers (namely those that they call <hi>Soldado Vetche</hi>) that the greatest Dukes or Princes in the field, Court, or Towne, encountering a Souldier, salutes him with curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, takes him to his Table, and vseth him with such enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement and reuerence, that it is a world to beholde. And when seruice is to bée séene, either in battaile, or at an assault: The greatest Duke or noble man, thinkes himselfe happy to bée ioyned with a knowen Souldier: and commonly both olde and young of their nobility, are formost in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is a thing incredible among some ignoraunt persons, to be told how Souldier-like, and manlike in all poinctes they behaue themselues, and how little account they make of life, when death must be sought by ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and thereby their honour and liberty of Countrey, is to be preferred.</p>
            <p>The Spaniards, a Nation not inferiour to any yet named,

ioyne so in amity at their méeting, make such courtesie, and shew such fastnesse of friendship (especially among Souldiers) that euery one in presence embraceth his companion, and in absence, lets fall good report of the absent. Yea, their loue and constancy by custome and ceremonies, knits them in such an vnion, that no straunger can seperate: and they giue so great place one to another, that it is hard to know by their gestures and vsages, which is the better of them. And they haue theyr own Souldiers in such a liking, that no people in the world, shall be suffered to reape any péece of their glory.</p>
            <p>The Italians Souldiers of great antiquity, and of no lesse value with most humility and ciuill manner, enterchaungeth their talke: yéelding for one gentle word, twenty good tearms, smooth speeches, and philed phrases. And happening to come together, either in seruice, or otherwise: they agrée like bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and depart without quarrell. And their great men and mightiest in power, if they repaire where Souldiers are, showes them selues of little authority, as a man might gesse by their courtesie: Refuseth to take any thing vppon them, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re the Marshall man approacheth, and seemeth to be at the disposition of such as haue serued, so great is the reputation of a Souldier among them.</p>
            <p>The Scots men, a stout and manly people, beginning to take a sauour in the warre, seekes sundry soiles to serue in: and haue great delight to be in the company of souldiers, and proue them selues worthy of commendation in any place they repair. And for that they would become famous, and attaine to some experience and credite, they shunne no kinde of seruice that is offered: and all the sorts of Gentility among them, estéemeth much a Souldier. Which is a signe that at the length, Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers will come to their ancient dignity and admiration, where the sound of Dromme or Trompet may be heard.</p>
            <p>Now to speake of our owne Nation were superfluous, (although many haue serued well, and sundry are yet in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of warre) because I haue named before diuerse thinges
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:5218:56"/>
wherein our countrey men haue wonne desired fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne, yet for arguments sake, and to enlarge this volume. Further matter may be treated of, neither hurtfull to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, that fauoureth well doing: nor hatefull to any when nothing shall be touched, but that which is necessary for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement of vertue.</p>
            <p>Our soueraigne Lady by Gods prouidence (to make vp the matter) I bring for a testimony of great regard to Souldiers, considering whom they are she hath holpen, in some sort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, and what good things haue passed among Souldiers, as her highnesse heard well of, or had intelligence giuen her to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, the worthinesse of those that haue well deserued. Doe but examine how many since her noble raign, of Souldiers haue had Leases, gotten liuings, béene preferred to gouernment, and gone from Court with full hands, that beganne with empty purses. And then tell the world openly, what secret suits were passed and what open wrong they doe them, that bountifully bestowed good gifts, wher any good cause appeared. Admit some by the report of their friendes, stole away the benefites from the fountaine head: yet looke to the rest of thinges that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely fell out, and you shall sée the best sort of Souldiers wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely rewarded, and nobly vsed. What care we though some silly soules, or seruiceable Souldiers watch at receipt, or are not spoken for by meane of some hinderers of good happe. Yet since other some, and many in number haue found good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, (say what they can) at her Highnesse handes that now remaineth Quéene ouer our Countrey, we cannot but confesse that the candle is in, and not burnt so far, but may giue a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blase and a new light, to lighten the minds of Souldiers, and such as sit in the comfortlesse shadow of darke dispaire.</p>
            <p>So to make short and prooue for the purpose, Souldiers in times past haue beene sette by, and dearely estéemed, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently in all places of the world embraced and made of. From whom sprong Herraldes, the erectours and publishers of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, &amp; all true fame and honour did rise: as for example, a
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:5218:57"/>
Knight made in the field, especially for seruice sake, hath much more to reioyce of, then he that at home is called to worship, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in causes of gouernement and honourable offices, which are to be preferred before all other dignities and calling. Chée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly for that our whole publike state and princely order, depends on their wisedomes without the which order, and Maiesty of rule, the ciuill would become sauage, and the world wax wild: so that the beastes in the field, and the people in the Towne, should soone for naughty manners be alike in condition.</p>
            <p>Now here is to bée noted, that Souldiers in olde time of ten yeares continuance, being forty yeares of age, was suffered to liue quiet, and bore the title of honour. Then reason will graunt, that who hath serued thirty yeares, without reproach or shame (and in a dangerous world and mischiefe) may claime by right a pention of the Prince, and stipend of the common Treasure. But what and if some of good birth and hauiour, haue béene much more then thirty yeares a follower of the warres, and neuer out of warlike exercises, all this long sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And yet are as new to beginne the world againe, as they were the first day they came from their Craddle. For any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, fauour of the Prince, or countenaunce and commodity of their countrey. Such Souldiers may say, they were borne in an vnhappy season, or found but could friends in time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, and triall of good Fortune.</p>
            <p>The affection of this worlde is led with such liking, (and the cunning of the wily can so finely curry fauour) that he that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer came néere the daunger of the Cannon, with looking bigge, and turning vp his mouchachose, makes men beléeue he is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, who fearing the monster will doe some mischiefe. And carried away by affection (for the goodly shew this kill Cow hath made) speake for him where goodnesse is to be gotten, and so a swad or a swirnpipe is called a good Souldier, (and goeth away with credite and liuing) when he that wants this cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and yet lackes no courage nor vallue liues vnrewarded, and consumes his daies in sorrow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:5218:57"/>Yet some holdes opinion, it is but hap that helpes, and ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cunning nor desarts that compasseth good liuinges, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines vnto benefite. Full bare and poore is that argument and reason, and men of such opinions, are as blinde as a bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell: to beléeue he is happy that hath no worthinesse in him, and he vnfortunate that lacketh no vertues. But the worlde is most ignorant and much to be blamed, that helpeth a shadow to great substaunce, and lets the worthy shift for their liuing that deserueth reward. and they are not to be excused, that by a colour of hap, aduaunceth the vicious person, and fauours not the foreward Souldier, and men of vertuous disposition. For gold and siluer are knowen by their weight and goodnesse: The flower by the smell: The horse by his pace, and euery o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing is tried and made of for his value. And must the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of men be subiect to hap, where men do helpe men, and are the iudgers of mans doings: that case is too cruel, and that hap is accursed gotten by such blindnes, and purchased by such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciality.</p>
            <p>In Rome where noble mindes were maruailously extolled, yet when diuerse men came to be preferred: euery Senator a part had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And looke who followed <hi>Pompey</hi> was misliked of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caesar,</hi> and so by this factious dealing many great Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, eloquent Oratours, and noble members of the Common wealth, were put off from poste to piller. And few that were worthy of cherishing, found good chaunce, or possessed any part of the hap, that they iustly might claime, by which frowardnes and misery of the time, is plainely to bée prooued, that there is no hap certaine. For man him selfe is the maker of hap, and the marrer thereof: euen as his lust is to like, or his hart is bent to lothe. For hap could doe nothing at all among them, their affections were so farre a sunder, and they haled such seuerall wayes, that their followers were left in the lash, or failed of their footing. Then speake not of hap, for God
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:5218:58"/>
and good men are the distributers of desired Fortune, and the onely causers of that which betideth, and must fall of necessity on some mens shoulders, as in the Booke of <hi>Boetius de conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latione,</hi> is manifestly to be tried.</p>
            <p>Now leaue of hearing of hap, and note how nobly the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> vsed their Souldiers, namely those that at any time had succoured a Cittizen of Rome: and taken him out of the hands of his ennemies. For such souldiers as had done that seruice, was crowned with a garland or hat, made of the leaues of Trées, as I finde written in <hi>Plinie</hi> the xvi.

For since the ciuile warres had har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Romaines,</hi> it was thought a singular good deede, to let a Citizen liue in rest and peace.

We haue séene saieth <hi>Plinie</hi> in our time, two great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes for the Sea seruice, the one was of <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> (the which <hi>Pompey</hi> did Crowne, for hauing defeated the Pirates, and making the Sea cleare of Théeues) the second was of <hi>Marcus Agrippa,</hi> which <hi>Caesar</hi> did likewise Crowne, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing defeated the <hi>Cicilians,</hi> and purged the sea in like sort of Brigandes and Robbers.</p>
               <p>At the first foundation of <hi>Rome, Romulus</hi> did Crowne <hi>Hostus Hostilius</hi> with a garlande of leaues: because he was the first on the Walles, at the taking of <hi>Fidena.</hi> Now before a Burgoies shoulde at any time enioy this Crown

                  <hi>Ciuique,</hi> hée must rescue a <hi>Romaine</hi> Citizen, and kill the Ennemie that ledde the Citizen away Prisoner. It must bée likewise that the Enemie did holde and possesse the place, that same day that the <hi>Romaine</hi> Citizen was rescued in. It is necessarie that the man which hath béen succoured, should confesse the same before the people: For a Soldiours own witnesse in that behalfe, serues to no purpose. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore it is required, that he that was rescued, be known to be a Burgois of <hi>Rome.</hi> For if one doe rescue a King, that commeth to serue the <hi>Romaines,</hi> hée doth not merite for the same the Crowne <hi>Ciuique.</hi> In like sort, if one do rescue a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of an Armie, hee gets no more honor therefore, then though hée had rescued a simple Citizen. For they which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished this ordinaunce had no regard, but to the conserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> whosoeuer they were. The Priuilege of this Crowne shall bée to giue power, to weare a Hatte of broad leaues, as ofte as hée pleased that had béene once Crowned for his well doing. Further all the Senate had a custome, to rise out of their places, and to doe honor to them that haue had this Crowne, when they goe to sée the common playes and pastimes. And it is sufferable and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that they shall sitte in a seate néere the Senatours. And they shall bée exempt from all ciuill charges, not onely themselues, but their naturall Fathers and Graundfathers: And nowe beholde touching their Priuileges, there was one <hi>Cicinius Dentatus,</hi> according as wee haue sayde, Crowned fourteene times. And one <hi>Capitolinus</hi> had sixe times beene Crowned, for hee rescued <hi>Seruilius,</hi> then Generall of the Armie: notwithstanding <hi>Scipio Affrican</hi> would not suffer them to giue him the Crowne <hi>Ciuique,</hi> succouring his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the iourney of <hi>Trebia.</hi> O ordinaunce worthye of immortalitie (sayth <hi>Plinie</hi>) that assigneth no other prayse for such great workes, then this great honour, which surpasseth all other warlike Crownes.</p>

            <p>Yea, Soldiours and Herraldes hadde power to denounce warres, insomuch as the auncient <hi>Romaines:</hi> who were the Fathers of all Marshiall affaires, and conquerours of the world, held this for a most certaine rule.</p>

            <p>You may read in like manner, that there was a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Romaines, that merelie, or peraduenture in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, put a crowne <hi>Ciuique</hi> vppon his owne head: and looking out at a great windowe into the stréete, was espyed. And thereuppon apprehended, and brought before the Senate: where hée was iudged presently to be put to death, for touching and abusing that crowne <hi>Ciuique,</hi> which was ordayned for the wearing onely of an honourable Souldiour, and for such a one as had béene by desarte crowned with Triumph and Solempnitie in open audience. So this foolish man (albeit hée might meane but little harme) was had to the place of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, and there lost his life, to the great terrour of those that rashly meddle with thinges that become them not, and to the great honour of those that are aduaunced by vertue, and winneth with courage the wearing of this Crowne called the crowne <hi>Ciuique.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now comming downe to this present age in the time of our peace, where Souldiours haue nothing to doe, there is ynough spoken (and peraduenture too much) for the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours

First you haue heard, that seruing ten yeares honestly and truly, he is not onely past his prentiship, but also aboue a iourney man, and ought from all ioyrneis to be spared. As a man might saie, (though vnproperly compared) a good frée horse after his long labour, and many great iourneis is to bee ridden but seldome, and kept in the stable till extreme necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie requireth: and then is to bée vsed gentelie, least his stiffe limmes and olde bodie deceaues the Riders expectation. So a Souldiour comming to this age and perfection, or being past the iollitie of youth and youthfull actions: ought to be prouided for, and may without presumption plead for armes, albeit hee neuer gaue anye before, and can bring no great proofe of his house, gentrie, or dissent, and though he be the first of that house, stocke, &amp; name that gaue armes: his beginning is allowed of al our ancient writers and Princes, and shall put his aduersaries to silence, when in that point they séeke to deface him.</p>
            <p>I remember once I saw and heard an Italian (being in the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But sayd the Italian to his aduersarie, goe and doe that I haue doone, or passe through the like, and when thou hast mounted vp, and troden on euerye steppe that I haue passed: come to mée and I will fight with thée the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. But to say I will stoupe so lowe and abase my selfe (as a Lorde may in fighting with a Ruffian) beyonde the

compasse of my calling, I will not, nor no Law of Armes can commaunde mee. The matter came in question before the Prince of Orrange that now is dead, and the Duke of Sauoy yet liuing, and the challenger had a foule disgrace in the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a multitude: and the defendaunt had a rewarde of fiue hundreth Crownes allowed him by the Emperour, for preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his honour and estimation so much. This was done and openly seene, a little before the siege of <hi>Renttie,</hi> and stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for a good record. Then an old souldiour is a Gentleman, both worthy to giue armes and colours, and méete to be borne withall in causes of quarrell.</p>
            <p>An other proofe for the maintenaunce of my matter, I saw at the siege of <hi>Leeth,</hi> a Gentleman of great courage and birth (called Maister <hi>Ihon Soutch</hi>) quarrell with Captaine Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, then Maior of the fielde. And Mayster <hi>Soutch</hi> did vrge through ill words and stout language, Captaine Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall verye farre: which might haue mooued any manne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. But Captaine Randall in a manner vsed those words that the Italian had done, before expressed: and going fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on in communication, commaunded the Souldiours to lay handes on Maister <hi>Soutch,</hi> and swore hee would execute him, and learne all other by his boldnesse, to knowe their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And when Mayster <hi>Soutch</hi> was stayed, well qouth Captaine Randall since thou hast challenged mee, I will not vse my power and authoritie ouer thee: But by the fayth of a souldier, when I am out of the Sergeaunt Maiors roume I will meete thee, and make thy heart ake for those wordes thou haste giuen: excepte thou repent before of thy lewde demeanour. Mayster <hi>Soutch</hi> hauing disgested, and wisely waighed this matter: being talked withall of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in the campe, came like a Gentleman on himselfe, and acknowledged his fault most dutifully, and with great repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce: for which submission of his, hee was the better thought on after.</p>
            <p>This shewes and declares, that an auncient souldiour and

And the Husbande men were bounde when the Souldiours goe in the streetes, to crie with a loude voyce, to make place for the Souldiours.

They minded to take that profession of Armes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them: and so the king caused a Sworde to be girded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, and after embraceth those Gentlemen so knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then they did sweare to liue and die with him, and for him, which oath they would keepe and obserue. For if theyr Lord were slayne in the Warre: they would fight to their last breath, and kill him that had slayne theyr King. Or if at that instaunt they could not bring their purpose to effecte, they would watch and spie out a conuenient season, for the perfourmaunce of their promisse and oath. And vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedlie some of them woulde reuenge their Maysters death. They hadde a great regarde to their duety and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoure. They thought nothinge so precious as fidelitie, and their Princes fauour. They cared not for life: so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye might bee gotten by theyr death. They serued most faythfullye vnder them, that gaue them intertaynemente. They spared nothing, but spent liberally. They applied their onely studies for the mainteinaunce of their king and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. They would not suffer any dishonour, nor offer anye iniurie. They thought it a double death to loose their good name. They made no accompt of their meat, money, sléepe, or ease and little estéemed their owne liues or persons when they should make proofe and shewe of their manhood. Their wages and stipende was so much and so well payde, that euerye one of them might liue gallantlye: and the meanest might keepe to waite on him a man or a boye. The Lawe was that they might not marrie, and yet hadde Lemmans and Women appoynted by order, which they kepte and vsed well, and all quarrells was auoyded by that meanes. For they might not companie with their women, but at certaine seasons appoynted. Thus they past ouer theyr life time,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:5218:61"/>
without the care and trouble of Wife and Children. They might forsake vppon a good cause anye of their Lemmans. And their Women might at their owne willes forsake the menne. All those that accompanied these Souldiours were Gentlewoman, and of good birth, but might not bee marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to anie person after shée hadde béene at the Souldiours commaundement. And because many men by their often chaunging, happen to haue the companye of one Woman, they fathered not any Child, though it were neuer so much like them: and therefore their Brothers children did alwayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite their Landes and goodes. And this Lawe that those Gentlemen Souldiours should not marrie, was made by a King, that woulde not haue a manne of Warre to fixe his loue on a wife and children, nor thereby to waxe féeble spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and effeminate. But the king ordained, because these Gentlemen should haue no womannish manners nor minds: that they should haue all thinges at their willes, and liue in such libertie, as no one thing might drawe them from noble seruice, nor commaunde them to seruile drudgerie. And because they should be the more animated to liue in noble or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and encouraged to serue well: they were priuileged, that no man might imprison them for anye cause, nor they might not bee put to death by anye meane of ordinarie iustice. Howbeit when one killed another, or did sleepe with a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Woman, or did speake euill of the king then raigning. Then would the king hauing iuste and true information of the matter, make a Writing and sende the same to a head Officer, commaunding him to cutte in péeces the offendour, wheresoeuer hee was founde. And after hee was deade, there should bee hanged about him the kinges Writing, to shewe the people wherefore hee suffered: but no Law nor Iustice coulde touche him, before the king had iustlye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned him.</p>
               <p>So by this Libertie and honour that Souldiours had, is well to bee séene, that none by:
<hi>Caesar</hi> might meddle with
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:5218:62"/>
men of Warre. And it séemeth this libertie was fetched from <hi>Alexanders</hi> dayes, who called his olde souldiours Noble men, and gaue them noble priuileges and rewardes: to cause the Worlde that did followe, to augmente their renowne, and spreade theire fame to the highest Heauens, that haue beene valliant on earth and Noble of minde. Which great fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of <hi>Alexander</hi> and other great Princes to aduaunce Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours: hath made menne more like Gods, than earthly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and done such good to the Worlde thereby, that there is no Worlde, but will make of men of Warre, and giue place to the goodnesse of those, that striue by stoutnesse of heart, and labour of bodie to enlarge the limmets and boundes of his Countrey.</p>

            <p>The effect of this aboue expressed, was drawne out of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, and remaines among Christians, as a matter worthy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, though Infidells did obserue them.</p>
            <p>Now though a man haue had charge, and borne a number of Offices: yet the name of an old soldiour beautifies his title. But yet perticularly I will goe through the offices, as breefly as I maie, and therein shew who may iustlie bée called Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen among them. A Collonell, a Captaine, and Ensigne bearer. A Lieutenaunt, a Corporall, a Sergeant of the band, and old souldiour though hée neuer bare any office, are all gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, graunting and allowing that none of the officers were made for affection at home. But had their beginning by ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in the Feelde, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that all sorrowes are to be compted, but a sharpe sause to season the appetite, and bring the sweete and delicate dishes into such order, that it glut not the stomacke.</p>
               <p>

                  </gap>ittes take their begininges. The very issue and originall of those yearthly commodities, springes onely from continuall care and paine: and labourious vexation of body and minde. The greatest glories, and chiefest seates of honour any where, are gotten and compassed by this kinde of calamitie, and the least or most sparkes of mans delite is maintained (and at the length enioyed) by the meane of studious labour, and paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full exersices.</p>
               <p>But herein to be briefe, paine and labour is the portion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for man in his pilgrimage, and they that are most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted (so they be not tempted aboue their strength) are most to be thought in fauour with God, and happiest among men: if heauenly graces and correction, be measured by the yearthly vesselles of vanitie, that we carry about, which without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and refourming, would growe so full of filthe and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt manners, that they neither could holde good liquor, nor serue to any good purpose.</p>
               <p>Doe you not behold that the purest mettall, with ill looking vnto, becometh full of cankers and rust: if it be not scoured, rubbed and roughly handled, his beautie decayeth, and the worth and vallue of it is little, because it hath lost his vertue and estimation. So mans corrupt Nature, were it not serched with sundrie instrumentes (that takes away the dead flesh, and toutcheth the quicke) would putrifie, and waxe lothsome to the whole world and to the creature himselfe, that beares it in his bowells. And for the auoiding of such an inconuenience, calamitie must be tasted, and troubles are necessary,, for the keeping cleane of a spotted conscience, and fraile body puffed vp with Pride, and vanitie of curious conceits.</p>
               <p>And so I proue aduersitie, is the bringer home of good spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, and gentill wittes, that wanders after worldly follies, and runnes a gadding beyonde the boundes of measure, to the vtter confines of daunger and destruction.

               <p>Mans prosperous estate breedes but idlenesse, nourisheth vice, contemnes vertue, and banisheth good studies and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: albeit some one among the richest, at one season or other, may looke on a booke, fauor writers and giue good speeches of well dooyng. Yet seldome comes any great worke from their handes that are in prosperity. And none in a manner but the afflicted, did at any time hetherto, yeeld benefit to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: and knowledge to the vniuersall worlde.

his maister, and all the vices of man he maistered, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the crossyng chances of this worlde, and vertuous operation of calamitie, which miraculously worketh the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered minde as the hote Fornace tries out the Golde, and the warme fire bringes in temper, and makes softe the hard and coldest Waxe. A deuine secret to them that are chosen, and familiar example to those, that glories in wordly felicitie who knowes the naturall causes of earthly thinges.</p>
               <p>If a man might aske wherefore was man made, sent from the highest dignitie of pleasures, to this lowe dongion of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and base soile of seruitude. It may be aunswered: Adam was thrust out of Paradice, for offence he had committed, and for that he was formed out of the earth, on the race of the earth he should get his foode and liuing, as a vessell ordained to beare all manner of liquour, that is put into it: and as a Creature condemned to tast and feele tormentes, sorrowes, and troubles, wherein man sees Gods mercie, and his owne infirmities. And refusing to beare and suffer, what is laied vpon him, hee seemeth to holde an other course then God hath appointed, and so seeketh that he cannot attaine. For since the earth was cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, it neuer could bring forth but cares, and griefe of minde: The onely fruit and painefull portion, that was from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, prepared for al Adams children and posteritie.</p>
               <p>Now some will replie and say, that the rich and wealthy of the worlde, that may wallow and tumble on their treasure: Haue builded such bulwarkes against the assaults of fortune, that no troubles can touch them, nor make them yeeld to the common calamitie of our life, but who soeuer so thinketh, is vtterly deceiued. For ritches is not gotten nor kept, but with much care and labour, and where it is possest, it bringeth daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, dread, disdaine and a thousand euills with it: Tempting man to riot, and lasciuious liuing, and leadeth the soule to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, by a number of infinite follies, except a speciall grace doe vphold it, it runneth headlong into hell, and looketh sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vnto heauen. And commonly when men doe grow ritch, they surfet so often with bankettes or bibbing, that they are
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:5218:72"/>
full of deseases, and so shortens their daies.</p>
               <p>Which libertie of life, and boldnesse in abuses (that springs on aboundance, the roote of disorder) puffes them vp in Pride, pampers them in pleasures, and blindeth so their iudgements, that they neither can sée who deceiueth them, nor finde out the right way of heauenly felicitie. And yet the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>latterie of one, and falsehood of an other about them, bréedeth such businesse, and raiseth such stormes (where quietnesse is looked for) that the ritch mans house is neuer without blonder, brabble, and brau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges. So that vnder the calmest shewes &amp; ciuilest manners, lurketh terrible tempestes, and fearefull suspitions, which in that kinde is a domesticall calamitie, and miserie incurable.</p>
               <p>And so al the iollitie and pompe of the earth (enioyed by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritaunce, or purchased by fortune) are accompanied with paine, enterlarded with dolloure, &amp; mixed with vnquietnesse, and may bee compared to a rotten painted wall, that vnder faire collours, hath many a foule fret, which deceiueth the eies of them that lookes on it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or giues those a great ouerthrow that leaneth against it. But this is no proofe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riches is cause of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but this rather shews that sorrow care, &amp; many misfortunes doth follow riches, &amp; pouertie (so it be not bare indigence) is void of hazard, frée from fortunes mutability, &amp; coumpted most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, in comparison of the goodnes that belonged to a blessed life.</p>
               <p>God, in beholding the vices of many, and sées some bent to estéeme villanie, or offence: doth cut of their dayes by soddaine mischances (or on a set purpose, through the Deuine power) because their euill shall not hurt the good. And regarding the other sort that will, or may amend: leaues them to the touche of their consciences, with good respite and leasure to repente, sending them miserie, trouble, and disquietnesse onely as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint and bridle, to plucke them from vices. And so calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie may bee accompted a precious purgation: and prosperitie may be iudged a Pestilent desease, which encreased, or begun by disordered life, is rather to be called a calamity, &amp; sickenesse of the soule, then a health of the minde, or good renowme to the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:5218:73"/>
bodie.</p>
               <p>Many great personages, being ouercome with the casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this world, and mutabilitie of fortune, haue after their fall into persecution, taken all thinges in good part, and made but small ado, nor account of their state when aduersitie appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and béene often time as glad to vse the libertie of minde, in a serui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e sort, as they were well pleased, when their bodies tooke most pleasure, and had the world at commaundement. For of necessitie stormes followe calmes: and callamitie either last or first, dooth visitte an earthly vessell. For some come to Kingdomes from induraunce, and some fall to miserie from wealth and honor. <hi>Dyonisius</hi> was glad to keep a Schole, after hee had lost his Empire, and <hi>Andronico</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> when his Countrey was subdued by the Romans, was faine to serue sundry miserable Maisters: and after led a Lyon about Rome, to the end of his dayes. But though I brought a Tyrante and and Infidell, to shewe that calamitie must bee tasted: so could I rehearse many Christen princes, that calamitie hath touched, and made them as happy by those crosses they haue borne, as some others are blessed that makes boast, that haue neuer suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered torment.</p>
               <p>Calamitie is like a supplyng salue that heals a sore Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her. A pretious preseruatiue, to keepe the head from surie of folly. A gentill medicine to reforme an infected conscience. A bitter draught of drinke: that purgeth a stout corrupt stomake: A sowre sirope or sauce that seasoneth a lewde appetite. And the sweete Salte of mans felicitie, without the which no life can be well seasoned.</p>
               <p>Who feeles himselfe afflicted, hath cause to conceiue hee is not forgotten (where fauour is most to be desired) and be that is let alone, to followe his owne pleasure, walkes as a caste-away, and hath nothing to reioyce of. For his bad spirite leads him to distruction, and his good Angell hath forsaken his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, which is a signe he is giuen ouer, to his naughty incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and is suffered to slide or fall downe right, when the
