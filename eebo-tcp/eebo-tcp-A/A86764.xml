            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat we are deeply ſenſible how much the <hi>Cauſe of God</hi> in this Nation hath ſuffered, for ſome years paſt, by the Apoſtacy of ſome perſons, which at the firſt were great Aſſertors thereof: ſtrong endeavours being uſed to introduce a Perſonal Intereſt, and to center in a Monarchy, after the cutting off the late King; notwithſtanding a Commonwealth was ſo happily ſetled, without a <hi>King or Houſe of Lords:</hi> And the better to accompliſh this their Deſign, many faithful Officers in the Army, and other places of Truſt in the three Nations, which could not comply with them therein, were (as we conceive) without Law or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſpeedily diſplaced, and many of them committed to priſon, to the fading of the hearts of the good people, and encouraging of the Common Enemy.</p>
            <p>Now ſeeing the God of Heaven, who makes it manifeſt, that He rules in the Kingdoms of Men, hath put it into the hearts of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Army, to give glory to God, in acknowledging their wandrings from righteous and equal paths, have thereupon judged it their <hi>Duty,</hi> to invite you to re-aſſemble, and proceed in the exerciſe and diſcharge of your Truſt, we cannot ſufficiently acknowledge the goodneſs of GOD, in calling together this Renowned Parliament, hoping that God will make you the Inſtruments of healing Our Breaches, reſtoring pathes to dwell in, to take off all Yokes, and to let the Oppreſſed go free; And we are the more encouraged, (in our hopes) by your late Worthy <hi>Declaration</hi> you have already made, wherein you reſolve (through God's aſſiſtance) to endeavour <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
