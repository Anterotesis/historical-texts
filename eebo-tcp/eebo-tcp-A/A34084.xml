            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

many of that Order have not the Advantage or the Opportunity to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this Knowledge from the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Authors, and therefore are forced to ſeek it in the Roman Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Councils, and the Modern Historians of that Church: Where every thing is miſrepreſented and placed in ſo Falſe a Light, that its hard to find out what is Truth. Some of the genuine Remains of Antiquity they have concealed, but they have falſified and altered more, and added ſo much to the Primitive Records, eſpecially in the first Four Centuries, that near Three Parts of Four (both in <hi>Baronius</hi> and the <hi>Councils)</hi> are modern Forgeries, manifest Legends, and impertinent Excurſions into Sophiſtical Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of the later Doctrins and

'Tis true, divers Eminent Men have made ſome ſteps toward it; but it is too great an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking for any One Man to accompliſh, as appears by that generous Project of Dr. <hi>Thomas James,</hi> Propoſed to the Moſt Learned Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to employ a Select Company of both <hi>Univerſities,</hi> with due Aſſistances and Encouragement for the perfecting this Deſign: Wherefore in the mean time, it may be ſerviceable to gather together ſome Materials for ſo Noble a purpoſe, and that firſt encouraged me to make theſe Obſervations as I

was Reading the <hi>Annals</hi> of <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> with the <hi>Councils:</hi> Which I have (by the Advice of ſome of my Friends) Methodically digeſted in this little Tract; and I hope it may be uſeful, not only to direct ſuch as apply themſelves to this kind of Study, but alſo to confirm others of Our own Communion in their firm Adherence to their Excellent Religion, when they ſee ſo many plain Evidences, That all the <hi>Roman Churches</hi> Pretences to Antiquity (both in Doctrin and Worſhip) are founded on, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by little elſe, but thoſe <hi>Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> and <hi>Corruptions,</hi> by which they Impoſed upon the Ignorant and Eaſie World for Six or Seven <hi>Centuries</hi> together. Theſe Pious Frauds (as They counted them) did indeed then advance their Intereſt, and establiſh
<pb facs="tcp:108925:5"/>
their Errors; but now when they are detected by this Diſcerning Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they prove their utter Shame; and did not Secular Advantages and Implicit Faith, or Fear and Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hinder thoſe under their Yoke from being acquainted, or however from owning theſe unfaithful Actings of their Spiritual Guides; Theſe Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries would not only ſecure Our People, but make many Converts from Them.</p>

            <head>THE Introduction.</head>
            <p>WHen <hi>Campian</hi> long ago undertook to defend the Roman Cauſe, he boaſted, that <hi>He was ſtrengthned with the firm and powerful Guard of all the Councils, and that all the General Councils were on his ſide</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Campian.</hi> decem rat. pag. 24, &amp; 30.</note>. Which vain Brag the Writers from the Roman Church do frequently repeat to this very day. But he that with Judgment and Diligence ſhall peruſe their own allowed Editions of the <hi>Councils,</hi> will eaſily diſcover the falſhood of this Aſſertion: For there is ſuch adding and expunging, ſuch altering and diſguiſing things in the Body of the Councils, and ſuch excuſing, falſifying, and ſhuffling in the Notes, that a Judicious Reader will ſoon perceive theſe Venerable Records, truly ſet down and explained, do not favour them. But theſe Corruptions are carried on with ſuch Confidence and Cunning, that an unexepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced and unwary Student, may be impoſed on by this ſpecious ſhew of Venerable Antiquity: For their ſakes therefore, it's neceſſary to take a ſhort view of that Fraud and Policy, which is ſo commonly made uſe of in thoſe Editions of the Councils which paſs through the Roman Mint, eſpecially in thoſe which are in moſt uſe among us, <hi>viz.</hi> The Edition of <hi>Severinus Binius</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Edit. <hi>Binii</hi> Concil. omn. <hi>Colon.</hi> 1618.</note>, and that of

               <hi>Labbé</hi> and <hi>Coſſartius</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Edit.</hi> Lab. &amp; Coſſart. Paris, <hi>An.</hi> 1671.</note>, wherein <hi>Binius</hi> his Notes are printed <hi>verbatim.</hi> Which uſeful deſign was begun by a Learned and Ingenious Gentleman, in a Tract entituled <hi>Roman Forgeries,</hi> printed at <hi>London, An. 1673:</hi> But that Author doth not follow the exact order of Time, nor doth he go much beyond the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and even in that Period he left out many plain Inſtances; And whereas he died, before he had proceeded any further; I reſolved to begin where he left off: But for Methods ſake, and to make thid Diſcourſe more entire, I have begun with the firſt <hi>Century,</hi> and ſo proceeded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the order of the ſeveral Councils (only writing more briefly upon the Three firſt <hi>Centuries,</hi> which were largely treated of in that Author before) deducing the account of theſe Impoſtures down to the end of the Fourth <hi>Century,</hi> and ſhewing (as I go along) what Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices have been uſed by the Editors and Annotator to dreſs up theſe Ancient Evidences, ſo as to make them look favourably upon their great <hi>Diana,</hi> the <hi>Supremacy</hi> and other Corruptions of the Roman Church. To this end they have publiſhed many ſpurious Councils, many counterfeit Canons and forged Decretals; and for ſuch as are genuine, they have frequently altered the Text, both by Additions and Diminutions, and have ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed the Senſe by partial and fallacious Notes, that it will be evident (by the Remarks here made upon them) their buſineſs in the publiſhing theſe Volumes, was not to promote the Truth, but to ſerve a Party. Nor can any thing elſe be expected from <hi>Binius</hi> his Notes, which (as he owns in his Preface) <hi>He took out of</hi> Baronius, Bellarmin <hi>and</hi> Poſſevin: <hi>The deſign of which three Men</hi> (ſaith <hi>Richerius</hi> an ingenuous <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> Doctor) <hi>is evident to all Men to have been no other, but to prove the Pope was appointed by
<pb facs="tcp:108925:7"/>
Chriſt to be the abſolute Monarch, and Infallible Judge of his Church</hi>

                  <hi>Richer.</hi> Praef. ad hiſt. Concil. pag. 4.</note>. And ſince the Notes chiefly follow <hi>Baronius,</hi> we have, as we go along, in every Period noted ſeveral of the deſigned Falſhoods, and of the Contradictions, Errors and Miſtakes in his <hi>Annals.</hi> Which Hiſtory is ſo full of Forgeries, falſe Quotations, and feigned Tales to ſet up the Credit of the Roman Church, and its corrupt Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Practices, that to diſcover them all would require almoſt as many Volumes as his <hi>Annals</hi> make: So that we muſt content our ſelves with ſome of the plaineſt Inſtances which fall into this Matter of the Councils, and will ſet them in a clear Light, and ſhew they are as contrary to Reaſon, as they are to true Hiſtory. Which <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking we hope will be many ways uſeful: Firſt, It will tend to the eaſe of thoſe who intend to read over the Tomes of the <hi>Councils,</hi> or the Annals of <hi>Baronius,</hi> and ſave them much time and pains by preſenting the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Errors of thoſe great Volumes at one View, which they would ſpend a long time in ſearching after, if they were to gather them up as they lye diſperſed. Secondly, It may be very uſeful to thoſe who deſire to be rightly informed in the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies between us and the Roman Church, becauſe it will give them a clear proſpect of what <hi>Councils</hi> and other Antiquities are Authentic, and may be allowed for Evidence in this Diſpute; wherein our Adverſaries have ſo little regard to their own Honour, that generally one half of their Evidence is ſuch as they have either forged or corrupted. Thirdly, It will be neceſſary (by way of Antidote) to prepare thoſe, who by reading Books ſo full of Infection, may by theſe plauſible Falſifications be in
<pb facs="tcp:108925:8"/>
danger to be ſeduced into a great eſteem of the Opinions and Practices of the Roman Church; when they find ſo many ſeemingly ancient Tracts and Councils brought in to juſtifie her in all things, and ſee (by this falſe Light) all Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory and Records ſo modelled, as to perſwade their Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, That in the pureſt Chriſtian Times, all things were believed and done in the Catholic Church juſt as they are now at <hi>Rome.</hi> But when it ſhall appear, that all this is a continued Series and train of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures, it will render their Notions and Practices, not only ſuſpected, but odious, as needing ſuch vile and baſe Artifices, to make them ſeem agreeable to true Antiquity.</p>
            <p>To this it may be Objected, That divers of the Modern Writers of this Church, and eſpecially the moſt Learned, do now own divers of theſe Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which we here detect to have been ſpurious, and therefore it ſeems needleſs to prove that which they have already granted us. I reply, That none of them own all theſe Corruptions, and divers of their Authors cite them very confidently to this very day, and ſtill the things themſelves ſtand in their moſt approved Editions of <hi>Councils,</hi> and the Remarks are only in Marginal Notes. But ſince they were believed in thoſe Ages, while their <hi>Supremacy</hi> and other Novel Doctrins were ſetting up, and were urged for good Proofs, till theſe Opinions had taken root; it is not ſatisfaction enough to renounce that Evidence, of which they now have no more need, unleſs they diſclaim the Doctrins alſo to which they firſt gave Credit: And till they do this, it is fit the World ſhould know by what Falſe Evidence they firſt gained theſe Points. For, if a Man ſhould get an

Eſtate by Bribing his Iury and his Witneſſes, it is not enough for him to confeſs theſe Perſons were Suborned, unleſs he reſtore the Ill gotten Lands; and till he reſtore them, he ought to be upbraided with his Bribery, even after he hath acknowledged it. Secondly, It may be alledged, That <hi>Junius, River</hi> and <hi>Daillé</hi> abroad; <hi>Perkins, Cook</hi> and <hi>James</hi> at home; have taken great pains on this Subject, and that the Learned Author of the <hi>Hiſtorieal Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Authority of General Councils,</hi> printed at <hi>London, 1688.</hi> hath already handled this Argument. I Anſwer, That the Six former are chiefly concerned in the Tracts of particular <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> and make few Remarks on the <hi>Councils:</hi> The laſt indeed keeps cloſe to the Great <hi>Councils,</hi> but paſſes over the Small ones; and any who compares this Diſcourſe with that, will find the Deſign, the Method and Inſtances ſo different, that this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will ſtill be uſeful in its kind, as that will be alſo: For here, in an acurate Order, all the Frauds of that Church are put together throughout every <hi>Century,</hi> not only what have been obſerved by others, but many now firſt taken notice of, and not obſerved before. And indeed, the Inſtances of theſe Frauds are ſo many, that we have been forced to give but brief Touches upon divers of the Particulars, and could neither enlarge upon ſingle Inſtances, nor adorn the Style; our buſineſs being chiefly to direct the younger Students in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity;</hi> and if our Remakrs be but ſo clear as to be underſtood by, and uſeful to them, we have our Aim. And it is hoped this may ſuffice to prove, That the genuine Records of <hi>Councils</hi> do condemn the Modern Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, Worſhip and Diſcipline of the Roman Church,
<pb facs="tcp:108925:9"/>
and that whatever in theſe Editions of them ſeems to countenance thoſe things, are Forgeries and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions deviſed on purpoſe to ſet a falſe gloſs upon their Modern Inventions. The Methodical Diſcovery whereof may convince any unprejudiced Man, That Ours is the truly Ancient and Catholic Religion, and Theirs a Device of later times, which cannot be rendred any way agreeable to the Primitive Writings, without innumerable Impoſtures and Falſifications.</p>

them, as alſo of the Proteſtants having corrupted or elſe rejected the greateſt part of them: But this whole Diſcourſe will ſufficiently ſhew the notorious untruth, both of their boaſting concerning Their own ſide, and of their Cenſures concerning Ours. In the Account of Scripture Councils, where they pretend to recite the words of Scripture, they add, for to give colour to their new Supremacy, <hi>That</hi> Peter <hi>ſtood up, as the Principal and Head</hi>

To theſe Paſſages of Holy Scripture the Editors have tacked a ſabulous Story of <hi>the Aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Virgin</hi> Mary <note n="f" place="margin">
                              <hi>Lab.</hi> pag. 24. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 3. col. 2.</note>; but they do not Cite one genuine Ancient Author, to prove it: That Book which bears the Title of <hi>Dionyſius Areopagitus</hi> being invented many Ages after, as Learned men on all ſides now agree.</p>
                        <p>§. 2. That Ancient Collection of Canons, which were decreed by the Apoſtolical Men in divers Synods held during the Times of Perſecution, is publiſhed by theſe Editors under the Title of <hi>The Canons of the Holy Apostles;</hi> and their Notes affirm, <hi>They were made by the Authority of the Apoſtles</hi>

                              <hi>Lab.</hi> pag. 53. <hi>Bin.</hi> pug. 14. col. 1.</note>; yet they are not agreed either about their Number or Authority. They print LXXXIV Canons; but the Notes ſay, <hi>only the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108925:10"/>
firſt Fifty of them are Authentic, but the reſt may and ought alſo to be received, ſince they contain nothing</hi> (Two of them excepted, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>65th</hi> and <hi>84th</hi> Canons, which contradict the Roman Church) <hi>but what is approved by ſome Popes, Councils and Fathers</hi> 
                           <note n="h" place="margin">ibid.
<hi>Lab.</hi> &amp; <hi>Bin.</hi>
                           </note>. Now, if (as they ſay) the Apoſtles made them, their Church hath been very negligent to loſe the certain Account of their number, and it is not very modeſt to pretend to try the Apoſtles Decrees by Popes Councils and Fathers; yet it is plain they make no diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the firſt Fifty and the following Thirty four, rejecting all that oppoſe their preſent Doctrine and Practice, as may be ſeen in theſe Inſtances.</p>
                        <p>The Sixth Canon forbids a Biſhop, Prieſt or Deacon (<gap reason="foreign">

                              <hi>Lab.</hi> pag. 53. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 14. col 2.</note> by a falſe Title, which <hi>Dionyſius Exiguus</hi> put to this Canon in his Verſion many Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies after, and by an Epiſtle of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Firſt, which all Men own now to be ſpurious, and by an Epiſtle of Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> who lived in the Year 600; as if the Senſe of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> and Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> when Single life was ſuperſtitiouſly preſſed upon the Clergy, were good proof, that Clergy Men did not live with their Wives many Ages before that ſuperſtitious Opinion was heard of. 'Tis certain the Greek Clergy are Married and cohabit with their Wives, according to this Apoſtolical Canon, and the Fifteenth Canon of the Sixth General Council: And it is not unpleaſant to obſerve, That theſe Notes cite the Second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> to prove there were no Canons made in the Sixth General Council; yet that very <hi>Nicene</hi> Council often Quotes, and highly approves the <hi>82d</hi> Canon of the Sixth General Council, as giving ſome Countenance to their Image-Worſhip. So that their wreſting this Canon Apoſtolical from its genuine meaning <note n="k" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Beve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridg.</hi> Not. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Tom.

The Ninth Canon orders <hi>All the Clergy and Laity who are in the Church, to Receive the Sacrament, unleſs they have a juſt Excuſe</hi>

                              <hi>Lab.</hi> pag. 55. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 15. col. 1.</note>: But the Roman Church allows the People generally to ſtand by and look on; and therefore though this be one of the Authentic Canons before ſaid by them to be made by the Apoſtles, after ſome ſhuffling to reſtrain it (contrary to the very words of the Canon) only to the Clergy: The Notes ſay, <hi>This whole Decree was made only by Human, not by Divine Authority, and is now abrogated by a contrary Cuſtom.</hi> So that if a Canon of the Apoſtles themſelves contradict a Corrupt practice of their Church, it muſt be abrogated and rejected.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>17th</hi> Canon ſaith, <hi>He that keeps a Concubine ſhall not be in any Order of the Clergy.</hi> The Notes cite ſome of their Doctors, who affirm, <hi>That this Crime doth not make a Clerk irregular</hi>

                              <hi>Lab.</hi> pag. 56. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 15. col. 2.</note>; and, that <hi>this Canon is now revoked.</hi> The Annotator himſelf is of Opinion, It is only public keeping a Concubine, by reaſon of the Infamy which makes a Clergy-mans Orders void: Wherefore ſuch Sinners have now more favourable Caſuiſts at <hi>Rome,</hi> than the Apoſtles or Apoſtolical Men were.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>65th</hi> Canon, though it have as good Evidence for it as any of the reſt, is rejected by the Notes <note n="n" place="margin">
                              <hi>Lab.</hi> pag. 60. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag 17. col. 2.</note>; becauſe <hi>it forbids Men to faſt on Saturday,</hi> which is now a Faſting-day at <hi>Rome.</hi> The Notes ſay, <hi>No Father men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions this Canon;</hi> but preſently own, That <hi>Ignatius, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Romanus,</hi> the Canons of the Sixth General Council, <hi>Gregory Nyſſen,</hi> and <hi>Anaſtaſius Nicaenus,</hi> (to which we add <hi>Tertullian</hi>

The Notes indeed ſay, but without any proof, <hi>That</hi> Rome <hi>received
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108925:11"/>
the Saturday Faſt from</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul; yet they grant ſoon after, <hi>That after the Hereſie of</hi> Marcion <hi>was extinct, the Roman Church did not only lawfully, but piouſly Faſt on Saturday.</hi> So that this was a private Cuſtom of the Roman Church, in which it differed from all other Churches, and they know not when it began, nor who it came from; yet for ſuch a Cuſtoms ſake they reject an Apoſtolical Canon.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>69th</hi> Canon expreſly enjoyns <hi>the Wedneſday Faſt;</hi> and the Notes ſay, That <hi>many Fathers mention it as of ancient Inſtitution;</hi> yea, theſe Notes affirm, <hi>It was certainly a Faſt of the Apoſtles inſtituting, being obſerved by the whole Church, and not appointed by any Council, but ſpoken of by Authors of greateſt Antiquity</hi>

Well then, I hope the Roman Church (whoſe Cuſtoms are all ſaid to be Apoſtolical) do keep this <hi>Wedneſday Faſt;</hi> They tell you, No: <hi>This Wedneſday Fast</hi> in their Church is changed into the <hi>Saturday Faſt:</hi> And ſo farewel to this Canon alſo.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly the 84th Canon gives us a Canon of Scripture, which doth not agree with the <hi>Trent</hi> Canon, for it rejects <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> from being Canonical, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not <hi>Wiſdom, Tobit, Judith,</hi> nor (in Old Copies <note n="r" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Coſens</hi> Hiſtor.

                              <hi>Lab.</hi> pag. 61 <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 18. col. 2.</note>: They alledge indeed ſome other frivilous reaſons, ſuch as, the leaving out the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and putting in <hi>Clements</hi> Conſtitutions: But it ſeems very probable to me, that it was not the Greeks (as the Notes ſuggeſt) but that Impoſtor (who gave theſe Canons a falſe Title and called them <hi>the Apoſtles Canons)</hi> which for carrying on his Pious Fraud, left out the <hi>Revelations,</hi> being not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at that time, when he would have us believe theſe Canons were made; and He alſo put in the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, which are forged in the name of the Apoſtles, who were to be ſet up as Authors alſo of theſe Canons: And if that were ſo, this 84th Canon being cleared from thoſe two Corruptions, is an Ancient and very
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108925:12"/>
Authentic Record of the true and genuine Books of Holy Scripture, but the Romaniſts reject it, as being a good evidence againſt their New <hi>Trent</hi> Canon.</p>
                        <p>§ 3. To theſe Canons are joyned a pretended Council of the Apoſtles at <hi>Antioch,</hi> firſt put into the Tomes of the Councils, by <hi>Binius,</hi> and continued by <hi>Labbè</hi>

                        <p>§. 10. Theſe Epiſtles, though pretended to be writ in the firſt four Centuries, were never heard of in the World till near 800 years after Chriſt: About which time came out a Collection of Councils under the name of <hi>Iſidore Hiſpalenſis;</hi> but whereas he died <hi>An.</hi> 636, and this Collector mentions the <hi>XIth</hi> Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> and the Sixth General Council, which were held near Fifty years after, this appears not to be the Work of that <hi>Iſidore,</hi> but of one <hi>Iſidore Mercator,</hi> and it was firſt brought into <hi>France</hi> by <hi>Riculphus</hi> B. of <hi>Mentz,</hi> in which Collection theſe <hi>Decretal</hi> Epiſtles firſt appeared; but the Learned <hi>Hincmarus</hi> of <hi>Rheims</hi> immediately diſcerned them to be an impoſture, and Writ againſt them, as <hi>Baronius</hi> confeſſeth <note n="p" place="margin">

An. 865. §. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</note>: But though he own the Cheat, he is not willing to grant the Roman Church had any hand in it, yet that is as clear as the Forgery; becauſe <hi>Hincmarus</hi> was hated and proſecuted by the Pope, and forced at laſt to Recant his Cenſure of theſe Epiſtles; and not long after <hi>Benedictus Levita</hi> having Tranſcrib'd divers Paſſages out of them into his <hi>Capitulars,</hi> got them confirmed at <hi>Rome,</hi> which could not but cheriſh ſo advantagious a Fiction that ſupported the Supremacy, which they then did ſo hotly ſtickle for; and therefore

though they came firſt to the Birth in <hi>Spain;</hi> ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture they were all Hatched at <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe evil De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and Intereſt they are contrived to ſerve: But the Age was ſo Ignorant when they were Invented, that there is ſuch infamous and convincing Marks of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery upon them, as makes it very eaſie to prove the Cheat beyond any poſſibility of doubting; and we will here put the principal of them together under their proper Heads.</p>

Finally, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will take pains to obſerve <hi>Labbe</hi>'s Margen ſhall find, that he with great diligence hath marked in the Margen of all theſe Forged Epiſtles, the very places of later Authors out of which they are ſtollen, and tranſcribed by their cheating Compoſer, who patcht them up together out of the Writings of S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> Pope <hi>Leo, Innocent, Gelaſius,</hi> and <hi>Gregory, &amp;c.</hi> who lived many years after all theſe Popes were dead, which is an Unanſwerable Proof, that they could not be writ by thoſe whoſe Names they bear.</p>
                        <p>§ 15. Fifthly, Thoſe Popes could not but know their own Times; and if they had writ them, they could not have been miſtaken in Chronology, or in the Date of their Epiſtles; but the Forger of them had ſo little skill in the Times for which he invented them, that he is almoſt every where erroneous in his Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. The two firſt Epiſtles of <hi>Clement</hi> are written to S. <hi>James</hi> after S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s death; yet it is confeſſed by <hi>Binius,</hi> S. <hi>James</hi> dyed ſix or ſeven years before S. <hi>Peter. Binius</hi> would ſolve this by ſaying, <hi>The Name of</hi> James <hi>crept into the Title instead of</hi> Simeon; but alaſs! the Name of <hi>James</hi> is repeated often in the very Body of the Epiſtles, and that proves them Forged <note n="k" place="margin">

And it is evident, that the <hi>Pontifical</hi> names the ſame falſe Conſuls, ſo that either one Author forged the Popes Lives and their Epiſtles, or the Inventer of theſe Epiſtles took the Conſuls Names ſo conſtantly from the <hi>Pontifical,</hi> that he imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates him in falſe-ſpelling the Conſuls names, and in joyning Men who were never Conſuls together; yea, becauſe that Fabulous <hi>Pontifical</hi> uſually Names no Conſuls, but thoſe in Office at Every Popes Entrance and Death, This Forger of the Epiſtles dates them all either by the firſt or laſt Conſuls of every Pope, as if all the Popes had only written Epiſtles in their firſt and laſt years: A Few Examples of theſe Errors ſhall ſuffice.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Pontifical</hi> makes Pope <hi>Euariſtus</hi> to enter when <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Vetus</hi> were Conſuls, and to be martyred when <hi>Gallus</hi> and <hi>Bradua</hi> were Conſuls, and ſo the Forger dates his firſt Epiſtle by the names of his firſt Conſuls, and the ſecond Epiſtle by the Conſuls of his laſt year: But alas! both the Pontifical and Epiſtles are wofully miſtaken, ſince <hi>Euariſtus</hi> (as <hi>Baronius</hi> proves) entred the <hi>13th</hi> year of <hi>Trajan,</hi> that is, four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years after the Conſulſhip of <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Vetus,</hi> and two years after the Conſulſhip of <hi>Gallus</hi> and <hi>Bradua;</hi> ſo that by this Account he writ Decretal Epiſtles long before he was Pope <note n="m" place="margin">

§. 16. Now though it be ſo apparent and undenſable, that theſe Epiſtles are Forged, and conſequently of no Authority; yet the Roman Church hath made great uſe of them in the Ignorant Ages: For <hi>Binius</hi> notes all along in his Margen, what Sections of them are tranſcribed into their Canon Law; and even in later times their Writers againſt the Proteſtants do commonly cite their Infamous Impoſtures, to prove the Supremacy of the Pope, his Infallibility, and right to Appeals; as alſo for the exemption of the Clergy, their Celibacy and Habits, and to prove <hi>their Maſs with its Ceremonies, Auricular Confeſſion, Apocryphal Books, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, Chriſm, Veneration of Relicks and Martyrs, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Cook</hi> in his <hi>Cenſura Patrum,</hi> hath noted the ſeveral Epiſtles, and the Authors which cite them, ſaving us the labour of inſtancing: And therefore we will only make a few general Obſervations upon this matter, and ſo diſmiſs theſe Forgeries.</p>
                        <p>Obſerv. I. That ſince the Romaniſts have no other genuine Ancient Authors, to prove theſe New Doctrines and Practices by; but are forced generally to place theſe apparent Forgeries in the Fore-front of all their Authorities, we may conclude theſe Points of their Religion are all Innovations, unheard of in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Ages; ſo that <hi>Iſidore</hi> was forced to invent theſe Epiſtles almoſt 800 years after Chriſt, to give ſome ſhew of Antiquity to them; and theſe Points were in thoſe Ignorant Times miſtaken by this means, for Primitive Uſages and Opinions, and ſo got footing in the World under that diſguiſe; but now that the Fallacy is diſcovered, the Doctrines and Practices ought to be diſowned as well, as the Epiſtles on which they are built.</p>
                        <p>Obſerv II. There are many other Points of the Roman Religion, which are not ſo much as mentioned in any of theſe Forged Epiſtles, ſuch as <hi>Worſhip of Images, Formal Praying to the Saints, and to the Virgin</hi> Mary; <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, Half-Communion, and Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108925:21"/>
of the Hoſt, Purgatory, Indulgences, and Justification by Merits,</hi> with ſome others. Now theſe are ſo New, that in <hi>Iſidore</hi>'s time, when he invented theſe Epiſtles they were not heard of nor received, no not in the Roman Church; for if they had, no doubt this Impoſtor, who was ſo zealous to get Credit for all the Opinions and Uſages of that Church which he knew of, would have made ſome Popes write Epiſtles to juſtifie theſe alſo, and his ſilence concerning them makes it more than probable, that theſe were all invented ſince the year of Chriſt 800.</p>
                        <p>Obſerv. III. Though the later Romaniſts frequently cite theſe Forged <hi>Decretals,</hi> yet no genuine Author or Hiſtorian for Seven hundred years after Chriſt did ever Quote or Mention them, no not ſo much as any of the Popes themſelves in all that Period. Now it is morally impoſſible ſo many important Points ſhould be ſo clearly decided by ſo many Ancient Biſhops of ſo Famous a Church, and yet no Author ever take notice of it. And doubtleſs when the Popes attempted to be Supreme, and claimed Appeals about the year 400, <hi>Zoſimus</hi> and <hi>Boniface,</hi> who quarrelled with the Eaſtern and <hi>African</hi> Biſhops about theſe Points, and were ſo hard put to it for Evidence, as to ſeign ſome private Canons were made at the firſt general Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> would certainly have cited theſe Epiſtles, which are ſo clear Evidence for their pretences, if they had either ſeen or heard of them; but they do not once name them in all that Controverſie, which ſhews they were not then in being; yea, thoſe who know Church Hiſtory, do clearly diſcern, that the main Points ſetled by theſe Epiſtles, were things diſputed of about the Seventh and Eighth Centuries, a little before <hi>Iſidore</hi>'s time; and therefore theſe Forgeries muſt never be cited for to prove any Point to be Ancient or Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>

§. 17. Obſ. IV. Though the Inventer of theſe Epiſtles was ſo zealous a Bigot for the Roman Cauſe, yet many things are to be found in them, which contradict the preſent Tenents of that Church. For whereas the Pope now claims an Univerſal Supremacy even over <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> it ſelf; <hi>Clement</hi>'s firſt Epiſtle is directed <hi>to</hi> James <hi>the Biſhop of Biſhop's, Ruling the Hebrew Church at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and all the Churches every where founded by Divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>

in theſe Epiſtles; Yet if any thing look kindly upon the Roman Church, they magnifie and vindicate it; but if it ſeem to condemn any of their Uſages, they reject and ſlight it: For Example, Pope <hi>Pius</hi> cites <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> XI. 18. againſt worſhiping Angels, and the Notes, reject both S. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s and <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s Expoſition of the place, as Reflecting on their Churches practice, adding that S. <hi>Paul</hi> condemned <hi>Cerinthus</hi> in that place, for giving too much Honour to Angels; Yet <hi>Binius</hi> ſoon after tells us that <hi>Cerinthus</hi> was ſo far from Teaching they were to be Adored, that he thought they were to be Hated as Authors of Evil <note n="n" place="margin">Not <hi>Bin.</hi> in 1.

                        <p>§. 19. I doubt I have been too tedious in diſcovering the Forgeries of theſe Decretal Epiſtles; but the Reader muſt conſider they take up the greateſt part of this firſt Period in the Volumes of the Councils, and we have here conſidered them all together: And now we have nothing to obſerve in this Century, except the <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Conſtitutions,</hi> which are left out in <hi>Binius,</hi> but print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Labbè,</hi> in Greek and Latin, next after <hi>Clement</hi>'s genuine Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> Now the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are a very ancient Forgery, compiled about the end of the Fourth, and beginning of the Fifth Century, of the Rites of which Ages they give a very good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and have little or nothing in them, to juſtify the more Modern Corruptions of <hi>Rome;</hi> for which cauſe it is likely <hi>Binius</hi> omitted them: But if we know before hand that the Apoſtles did not make them, nor <hi>Clement</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> collect them, and can pardon the boldneſs of making the Apoſtles the ſpeakers, they are uſeful to be read, as a writing compoſed in the Fourth or Fifth Age.</p>

However, if we allow the Matter of Fact upon the Teſtimonies of S. <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius;</hi> it will follow, That in thoſe Ages (when they uſed Glaſs Cups) they did not believe Tranſubſtantiation; for if they had, they would not have ventured Chriſt's Blood in ſo brittle a Veſſel, but have forbid the uſe of Glaſſes, as they have done in the Roman Church ſince this Opinion came in among them <note n="r" place="margin">

                        <p>Under this Pope the Editors place an <hi>African</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and ſay it was Reprobated; yet they cannot make it appear, that this Pope ſo much as knew of it.

However we are told, That <hi>Calixtus</hi> was buried Three Miles out of the City; becauſe the Law of the Twelve Tables forbid <hi>the Burying of a dead Body within the Walls.</hi> Now I would know, if this Law were in force, how that can be true which the <hi>Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical</hi> and the Notes affirm and juſtifie, That S. <hi>Peter, Linus, Cletus, Euariſtus, Sixtus, Teleſphorus, Hyginus, Pius,</hi> and <hi>Victor,</hi> were All Buried in the <hi>Vatican?</hi> And what ſhall we think of the Miracles done by their Relicks and at their Tombs, if no Body know where they were firſt Buried?</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Pontifical</hi> is forced to feign, That the Emperor <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> was a Perſecutor, contrary to his Character in all Hiſtories of Credit; and this only to make us think, that <hi>Calixtus, Urban,</hi> and Pope <hi>Pontianus</hi> his Succeſſor, were Martyrs.

his time.

                        <p>§. 3. Pope <hi>Fabian,</hi> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> relates, was choſen by occaſion of a Dove's lighting on his Head, when the People were met to elect a Pope; of which remarkable Story the fabulous <hi>Pontifical</hi> takes no notice, but tells us, <hi>That in this Popes time</hi> Novatus <hi>the Heretic came to</hi> Rome <note n="x" place="margin">
                              <hi>Lab.</hi> p. 638. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 95. col. 2.</note>; that is, ſay the Notes, <hi>Above a year after Pope</hi> Fabian <hi>was dead, after the Vacancy, and in Pope</hi> Cornelius'<hi>s time;</hi> with ſuch abſurd Comments do theſe Gentlemen delight to cover the Ignorance and Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of their Hiſtorian; but ſuch Excuſes do only more expoſe him. In this Pope's time were two Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils held, one in <hi>Africa,</hi> the other in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and they Intitle them both <hi>under Fabian;</hi> yet the only Authors, who mention theſe Councils, do not ſay Pope <hi>Fabian</hi> was concerned in either of them <note n="y" place="margin">

                        </p>
                        <p>After this Pope's death there was a Vacancy of more than one whole year, which the Editors, to ſlatter the Papacy, call (in the ſtyle of Princes) <hi>An Interregnum;</hi> but alas! their admired Monarchy, was now turned into an Ariſtocracy, and the Clergy governed the Roman Church; to excuſe which flaw in their viſible Monarchical Succeſſion, the Notes ſay, <hi>The Members next the Head knew it was their parts, to do the office of the Head:</hi> Which notable kind of ſubſtitution, if it could be made out in the Body Natural, Beheading would not be a Mortal puniſhment; however, they muſt ſay ſomething to make us believe there was always a Viſible Head of the Catholic Church, or at leaſt a Neck and Shoulders, which ſtood for an Head, till <hi>Cornelius</hi> was choſen Pope: <hi>And they called a Council</hi> (as they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108925:27"/>
pretend) <hi>in this Vacancy, and writ a Letter of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination to all the Churches in the World, that they might all obſerve what the</hi> Empty Chair <hi>of</hi> Peter <hi>had ordered</hi>

But if any one read the Letter it ſelf, it will appear that this Council was only a voluntary Aſſembly of the Clergy in <hi>Rome,</hi> and they met only to confirm S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Opinion, and only writ their Letter to him; but never pretended either to be Judges over <hi>Cyprian,</hi> or any other part of the Catholic Church.</p>
                        <p>Pope <hi>Cornelius</hi> his Life follows, for whoſe Character we are more obliged to S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Epiſtles, than to the <hi>Pontifical,</hi> which invents an idle Story of a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue between <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Decius</hi> the Emperor; and though the Notes own <note n="a" place="margin">

                              <hi>Lab.</hi> p. 567. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 108. col. 1.</note>. It is evident they have told us, the Body of S. <hi>Peter</hi> was in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> when Pope <hi>Victor</hi> was there Buried, <hi>An.</hi> 203: And there is no Author of Credit mentions their removal into the <hi>Catacumbae,</hi> and ſo conſequently no reaſon to believe they were fetcht back from thence in a time of Perſecution. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> lived 350 years after this, and was very apt to credit feigned Miracles, and he differs much from the <hi>Pontifical;</hi> ſo that probably the whole Story is forged, by thoſe who long after began ſuperſtitiouſly to adore the Relicks of Saints. However, it is read in the Roman Church <hi>Septemb.</hi> 16. and many devout People on the Credit of this Legend make Pilgrimages, and offer Prayers and large Gifts, to the Shrines of theſe

                        <p>In this Pope's time there were two Councils holden at <hi>Carthage,</hi> two at <hi>Rome,</hi> and one in <hi>Italy;</hi> all which in the general Titles are ſaid to be held <hi>under Cornelius</hi>

                        <p>About the very time of this Pope'<hi>s</hi> Apoſtacy was held a Council at <hi>Cirta</hi> in <hi>Africk;</hi> and though S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> the Author from whom they have all they know about it, ſay not one Word of <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> Yet the Editors and Annotator both, put in theſe Words, that it was <hi>under</hi> Marcellinus <note n="b" place="margin">

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108925:31"/>
Infallible Head muſt be cleared from Apoſtacy, though it be by the abſurdeſt Fictions imaginable: For he feigns this Apoſtate Pope met Three-hundred Biſhops near <hi>Sinueſſa,</hi> in <hi>Diocleſian</hi>'s time in a Cave, which would hold but Fifty of them at once, and their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was only to hear <hi>Marcellinus</hi> condemn himſelf, and to tell him he could be Judged by none. The two firſt Copies of this Council were ſo ſtuffed with Barbariſms, falſe Latin and Nonſenſe, and ſo contrary to each other, that ſome Body took Pains out of both to deviſe a third Copy, and by changing and adding at pleaſure, brought it at laſt to ſome tolerable Senſe: <hi>Surius</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> print all three Copies, but <hi>Labbè</hi> and the <hi>Collectio regia</hi> leave out the two Originals, and only publiſh the Third, dreſt up by a late Hand, which in time may paſs for the true account of this Council.

I ſhall not reflect upon the Abſurdity, <hi>of making the Pope his own Judge,</hi> when he denies the Fact, nor the Contradiction of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, ſaying often <hi>They muſt not judge him;</hi> and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring ſoon after <hi>That they have Condemned him</hi>

years before, which is but a very indifferent Proof: Well, but to magnify the occaſion, he ſaith, <hi>By this Pope</hi>'s <hi>fall, not only the Roman Church, but the whole Chriſtian Religion was in extreme danger; and in the Preſident of the Catholic Faith, the very Foundation of the Church was ſhaken and almoſt ruined:</hi> Yet a little before he had told us out of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> that <hi>Marcellinus</hi>'s fall did no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Church, and had affirmed <hi>that the ill Deeds of Biſhops may hurt themſelves, but cannot prejudice the Churches Orthodox Doctrine</hi>

Again, the Notes ſay <hi>it is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Truth of</hi> Marcellinus <hi>his fall,</hi> though the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> did not know of it, nor S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> no nor any of the <hi>African</hi> Church: Yet in the next Page it is obſerved, <hi>That there are very many Names of the Witneſſes which prove his fall,</hi> which are peculiar to the <hi>African</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: Now if theſe Names were peculiar to the <hi>Africans,</hi> then theſe Witneſſes were of the <hi>African</hi> Church Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, and then it is Morally impoſſible, that they ſhould never tell none of their Countrymen, of ſo Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a Tranſaction: The Notes confeſs that theſe Acts often mention <hi>Libra occidua;</hi> which is a Word invented after the Empire was divided into Eaſt and Weſt: And thence the ſame Notes infer, <hi>theſe Acts were not writ in thoſe Ancient times;</hi> yet they make it a wonder, that <hi>they were not ſeen in</hi> Africa <hi>in S.</hi> Auguſtine'<hi>s time or before:</hi> Which is to wonder that they had not ſeen them in <hi>Africa,</hi> before they were written: It puzzles the Annotator to make out an excuſe for that ridiculous Falſhood in theſe Acts, <hi>that</hi> Marcellinus <hi>was led into the Temple of</hi> Veſta, <hi>and</hi> Iſis, <hi>and there Sacrificed to</hi> Hercules, Jupiter <hi>and</hi> Saturn; becauſe theſe Gods were never placed, nor Worſhiped in the Temples of thoſe female Deities: Nor can he allow what the Acts ſay about this Council, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held when <hi>Diocleſian</hi> was in his <hi>Perſian</hi> War; for he affirms it was held Two years after that War, when <hi>Diocleſian</hi> had deveſted himſelf of the Empire, and lived a private Life; But then the Acts make <hi>Diocleſian</hi> to be preſent, and in <hi>Rome</hi> when <hi>Marcellinus</hi> did Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:108925:32"/>
and at this rate the Pope would have laied two years at leaſt in his Apoſtacy, which the Annotator muſt not endure. To conclude, we now ſee, <hi>That a Council held no body knows where nor when, concealed from all Ancient Authors, writ in later times, full of Barbariſms, and Non-ſenſe, Falſhoods and contradictions,</hi> if it do but pretend to make out the Supremacy and Infallibity of the Pope, and ſet him (while he was an Apoſtate and falſly denied the Fact,) above a Council of Three hundred Innocent Biſhops; if it do but ſay the Pope, though never ſo wicked, cannot be judged by any but himſelf: This Council ſhall be publiſhed by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Editors, and vindicated by partial Notes, as if it were a moſt genuine and Authentic Truth: From whence it is plain, That theſe Editors, and eſpecially this Annotator hath no other meaſure of Truth and Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but the Intereſt of the Roman Church, which they reſolve to promote, though it be by the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt means. And this may ſuffice to obſerve for the Third Century.</p>

Yea, doth not the preſent Roman Church adore Pictures as well as Images? ſo that ſtill this Canon condemns them. <hi>Martinez</hi> fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, <hi>This Council forbid Painting on the Walls, leſt the Pictures ſhould be deformed by the decay of thoſe Walls:</hi> But he forgets, that the Council firſt forbids them to be any where in the Church; and were not Walls as ſubject to decay in the time of the Second <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, as they are now?

Pictures; but thoſe which repreſented God and the Holy Trinity.</hi> But it is not probale, theſe Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were ſo ignorant, as to need any prohibition about ſuch blaſphemous Repreſentations of God's Majeſty. And he brings no proof, but his own bare Conjecture for this limitation of the Canon; which Fancy (if it were true) would prove, That the Saints were not worſhiped or adored in that Age, becauſe nothing that was worſhiped and adored, was to be painted on the Walls; and if that be meant only of God and the Trinity, then nothing elſe but God and the Trinity was adored in thoſe days: Finally, the former part of the Canon deſtroys this limitation, by excluding Pictures in general out of Churches. Theſe are the various Fallacies by which theſe partial Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, would hide the manifeſt Novelty of their Churches, Worſhip of Pictures, which cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by all theſe Tricks.</p>

The ſecond Epiſtle repeats the fooliſh Argument, <hi>of Chriſt's whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Buyers and Sellers</hi> (many of which were Lay-men) <hi>out of the Temple,</hi> to prove, <hi>that God alone muſt judge Prieſts;</hi> and out of a much later Roman Council, (ſuſpected alſo of Forgery) <hi>ſpeaks of the Peoples not

                        <p>
                           <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was born of Chriſtian Parents, and brought up under them, and was Thirty years old when he entred on the Empire. And from the Year 306 <note n="q" place="margin">

He profeſſed openly he was a Chriſtian, Making Laws to encourage Converts, and to ſuppreſs Paganiſm throughout his Empire, Building and Endowing Churches, and granting great Immunities to the Clergy; yet all this while He took no notice of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus, Euſebius,</hi> or <hi>Melchiades,</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſſors, and pretended Monarchs of the Church.

No, He muſt be a Pagan Eleven years after this, and a Perſecutor; yea, in the year 324 He was ſo meer a Heathen as to know nothing of the Chriſtian Rites, but what an <hi>Egyptian</hi> taught him. After he had openly profeſſed this Religion Eighteen years, He had forgot it all, and turned ſo great a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that Pope <hi>Sylveſter</hi> (who had no great mind to be a Martyr) ran away into the Mount <hi>Soracte,</hi> or was baniſhed thither: But <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> after He had been Ten years Pope, never had heard of him, till being ſtruck with a Leproſie (mentioned in no Authentic Writer) two glorious Perſons, whoſe Faces he knew not, appeared to the Emperor, and ordered him to ſend for Pope <hi>Sylveſter</hi> to cure him; who (when He was come) firſt ſhewed <hi>Conſtantine</hi> theſe two glorious Perſons were S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and then Cured him; made him a Chriſtian, and Baptized him. Which idle and ſelf-contradicting Romance is magnified by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:108925:40"/>
                           <hi>Baronius</hi>'s and <hi>Binius</hi>'s Notes; but we will now confute it as briefly as we can.</p>
                        <p>§. 7. Firſt, This whole Story is deviſed, to exalt the Glory of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; to make Men believe the Pope could work Miracles, and that the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperor was Baptized at <hi>Rome:</hi> But then it caſts ſuch a blot upon <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Memory, and feigns ſuch odious and incredible things of him, as no wiſe Man can believe concerning a Prince, who S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, was a Chriſtian Eight years before this <note n="u" place="margin">
                              <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 316. §. 59, &amp; 62, 63.</note>. And whoever reads in <hi>Baronius,</hi> the Hiſtory of the firſt Ten years of <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> from <hi>An.</hi> 314 till <hi>An.</hi> 324, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves what glorious Things he ſaith of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Religious Laws, his Piety to God, his Zeal for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, his Reſpect to Confeſſors, and his Bounty to Biſhops; his taking part with the Catholics againſt Heretics and Schiſmatics: He can never believe this ſcandalous Story of ſo excellent a Prince. But in all this Period of Time, <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelf cannot find one Evidence, That ever <hi>Constantine</hi> had any correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> and therefore Chriſtianity was ſetled in the Empire without the Pope's help: To cover which great Truth, ſome dull (but zealous Monk) long ſince invented this Sham Story, to ſave the Credit of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the Annaliſt and theſe Notes ſtrive to defend it.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, This Fable chiefly relies on the Credit of the <hi>Pontifical,</hi> (ſo often proved falſe) and upon the repute of <hi>Sylveſter</hi>'s Acts: But the Annotator at firſt ominouſly Charges them both with Falſhood <note n="w" place="margin">
                              <hi>Lab.</hi> p. 14 16. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 217. col. 1.</note>; the former miſtakes the Time of the Vacancy, and the latter (he ſaith) is wrong in making <hi>Melchiades</hi> ordain <hi>Sylveſter</hi> a Prieſt, he being Ordained by <hi>Marcellinus</hi> long before. <hi>Baronius</hi> alſo confeſſeth, That <hi>theſe Acts of</hi> Sylveſter <hi>are ſo falſe in many particulars, that it ſhakes the Credit of the whole</hi> 
                           <note n="x" place="margin">
                              <hi>Baron.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. 311. §. 59. &amp; An. 315. §. 10, 11, &amp; 12. &amp; An. 324. §. 41.</note>. But it is very ſtrange, after he (who is ſo concerned for their Reputation) had found ſo many Flaws in them, he ſhould juſtifie them even where
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:108925:40"/>
they contradict all the Hiſtorians of the Age; which can ſpring from nothing but a Reſolution to maintain every thing which made for the Credit of the Roman See.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The Notes ſay not only the Acts of <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter,</hi> but <hi>Zoſimus</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> do both atteſt this Story: Now firſt, <hi>Zoſimus</hi> was a Pagan, and <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> confeſs, He tells many Malicious Lies of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> for ſuppreſſing the Heathen Religion; and though they confute the reſt of his Calumnies, they defend his Relation of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Baptiſm, as ſounding ſomething like thoſe forged Acts <note n="y" place="margin">
                              <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 324. §. 17.</note>; and though his Account of it reflect as much upon <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> as is poſſible; yet the Annaliſt and Annotator labour to prove this Spightful Heathen to be a truer Hiſtorian, than <hi>Sozomen, Socrates,</hi> or <hi>Euſebius,</hi> whom they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as Lyars and Flatterers, not to be believed againſt <hi>Zoſimus.</hi> Yet there is a mighty difference between this Pagan's Hiſtory of the Baptiſm of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and that in <hi>Sylveſter</hi>'s Acts: <hi>Zoſimus</hi> ſaith, It was a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> named <hi>Aegyptius,</hi> lately by the Court Ladies brought acquainted with <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who adviſed him to be Baptized; and this the Notes ſay was <hi>Hoſius;</hi> yet it is plain, <hi>Hoſius</hi> was <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Intimate Friend, and his Legate into <hi>Egypt</hi> Twelve years before <hi>(z).</hi> Beſides, <note place="margin">(x) <hi>Baron</hi> An. 312. §. 91.</note> 
                           <hi>Zoſimus</hi> doth not name <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> and only deſigned by his Relation to blacken <hi>Constantine,</hi> and repreſent Chriſtianity as a Sanctuary for Villanies, which could not be expiated among the Pagans: But the Acts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of a Perſecution, and a Leproſie, and make <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the Adviſers of <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Baptiſm; and their buſineſs is only to ſet up <hi>Sylvester</hi>'s Name. And the Stories (like all Falſhoods) do not hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: As for <hi>Sozomen,</hi> he is no Evidence for <hi>Sylveſter</hi>'s Acts, nor doth he once name that Pope in the place cited <note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Sozom.</hi> hiſt. lib. 1. cap. 5.</note>. He only confutes the ſcandalous Stories, which <hi>Zoſimus</hi> had falſly told of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſhewing how improbable it is, that this Emperor (after he had Reigned nigh Twenty years) ſhould need a New
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:108925:41"/>
Converſion; and how unlikely it muſt be, that the Pagans would not have found out ſome Rites to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate him, that ſo they might ſecure him in their Religion: So that he is a Witneſs, That theſe Reports of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> were falſe, and invented by Malicious Heathens, and ſo far as <hi>Zoſimus</hi> and <hi>Sylveſter</hi>'s Acts agree, he confutes them both; and ſince he lived within an Hundred years after this time, while ſome alive might poſſibly remember theſe Paſſages; His early denial of theſe Fictions is better Evidence againſt them, than <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi>'s Teſtimony for them, after Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred years; to ſerve a Turn, and do Honour to that Church they reſolve to Magnifie.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, The Notes ſpeak of <hi>Sylveſter</hi>'s Returning to <hi>Rome</hi> in great glory; which is not mentioned in <hi>Zoſimus</hi> nor <hi>Sozomen,</hi> and only relies on the Credit of theſe Acts <note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>Lab.</hi> p. 14 17. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 217.</note>: Which have no Evidence to Atteſt them, but Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> who perhaps forged them; or however, firſt produced theſe Acts in the Second <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> Council, Four hundred and Fifty years after <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter</hi>'s time, to prove the uſe of Images in <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>'s Days. But the very Acts declare, That <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> (who had Built and Adorned ſo many Churches, and if Images or Pictures had then been uſed, muſt have ſeen the Faces of S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul)</hi> did not know the Faces of theſe two great Apoſtles, till <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter</hi> ſhewed them their Images.

                        <p>Firſt, <hi>Euſebius</hi> (who lived at that time, and knew <hi>Constantine</hi> very well, and writ his Hiſtory ſoon after) doth affirm this: And if it had been Falſe, many then alive who could remember it, would doubtleſs have expoſed him for ſo manifeſt a Fiction. The Notes ſay he Forged this Story in favour of <hi>Conſtantius;</hi> but he muſt be very Ridiculous, if he would be obliged by a Story of his Father, which many hundreds as well as himſelf, muſt have then known to be a Falſhood; And <hi>Euſebius</hi> muſt be as ſilly as he was knaviſh, to invent a Fable ſo eaſy to be diſproved by living Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: But the Notes wrong <hi>Euſebius,</hi> when they ſay, <hi>he</hi> reports <hi>that</hi> Conſtantine <hi>died Impious and alienated from</hi> the <hi>Catholic Church;</hi> For <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith he made a moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and Pious end: However <hi>Euſebius</hi> by this Teſtimony brings upon himſelf, all the Rage and Spite of <hi>Baronius</hi> and our Annotator, who upon all occaſions Blaſt this Holy and Learned Writer, to whoſe pains they and all the Chriſtian World are infinitely beholding; and though while <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s Hiſtory continues, it be almoſt the only

The ſame Notes ſay, <hi>The firſt Canon orders the ſame thing, which was decreed in the Thirty third Canon at</hi> Elliberis, <hi>and the Ninth at</hi> Ancyra: And if ſo, that is not, (as they falſly gloſs the Canon of <hi>Ancyra) That the Clergy ſhould live Single, or be reduced to Lay Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?</hi> For in that Canon ſome of the Clergy are allowed to Marry, and to continue to miniſter as Clergy-men ſtill. And the true Senſe of this <hi>Naeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeſarean</hi> Canon is, That whereas in times of Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, when Marriage was inconvenient, many Prieſts promiſed to live Single: Now theſe only were not allowed to Marry afterward <note n="l" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Beve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridg.</hi> Not. in Concil. <hi>Nicen.</hi> Tom.

The Fifth Canon <hi>forbids a Catechumen, who falls into Sin, to enter into the Church:</hi> By which the Notes ſay, That <hi>Baronius</hi> had ſharply cenſured <hi>Euſebius</hi>

Whereas in truth it was under no Pope, and being placed in the old Collections of Canons after thoſe of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and alſo mentioning <hi>the Photinians,</hi> it muſt be held long after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council <note n="w" place="margin">
                              <hi>Beveridg.</hi> not. Tom.

And the Reaſons given for this early placing it are very fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous: For firſt, The ſoftening of a Canon of <hi>Naeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeſarea</hi> is no certain Mark of time. Secondly, This Council rejects <hi>Judith</hi> out of the Canon of Scripture, and ſo did the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> alſo; for though S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> when he had told us, <hi>This Book is not of Authority ſufficient to determine Controverſies;</hi> adds, <hi>That the</hi> Nicene <hi>Synod is read, to have computed it among Holy Writings</hi>

S. <hi>Hierom</hi> only means, They allowed it to be Read for Inſtruction, but did not count it Canonical; for doubtleſs he would not have rejected <hi>Judith,</hi> if that Council had received it into the Canon. And he ſaith elſewhere, <hi>The Church indeed reads</hi> Judith, Tobit, <hi>and the</hi> Macchabees, <hi>but receives them not among Canonical Scriptures</hi> 
                           <note n="z" place="margin">Id. Ep. 115. ibid. p. 39.</note>; and again, <hi>A man may receive this Book as be pleaſeth</hi>

Herein therefore the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> doth not contradict the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> at all, as theſe Notes falſly pretend. Thirdly, This Councels decreeing the ſame things which were decreed at <hi>Nice,</hi> without naming it, is no Argument it was held before that of <hi>Nice;</hi> nothing being more ordinary, than for later Councils to renew older Canons without citing the former Councils for them.</p>
                        <p>The Notes on the Second Canon at <hi>Laodicea</hi> (which ſuppoſes Penitents, to make their Confeſſion by Prayer to God, and mentions no Prieſt) would willingly graſt <hi>the uſe of their modern Sacramental Confeſſion, to a Prieſt, upon this ancient Canon</hi>

on the Fifteenth Canon confeſſeth, that S. <hi>Paul Commands all the People to joyn in the Hymns, and that this Uſe continued to S.</hi> Hierom'<hi>s time; yet he owns their pretended Apoſtolical Church hath altered this Primitive Custom grounded on Holy Scripture;</hi> and that for very frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Reaſons <note n="d" place="margin">

But let it be obſerved, That this Canon forbids not the People to bear a part in the Church Service; but allows them not to begin, or bring in any Hymns into the Public Service. The Seventeenth Canon ſpeaks of <hi>the Aſſemblies of the Faithful</hi> in two Latin Verſions, and the Greek is <gap reason="foreign">

                              <hi>Lab.</hi> &amp; <hi>Bin.</hi> ibid.</note>. The Thirty fourth Canon mentions and cenſures thoſe, <hi>who leaving the Martyrs of Chriſt, go to falſe Martyrs;</hi> And the Fifty firſt Canon mentions <hi>the Martyrs Feaſts:</hi> Upon which the Notes <note n="f" place="margin">
                              <hi>Lab.</hi> p. 1526. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag 250. col. 1.</note> moſt falſly infer, <hi>That the Martyrs were then adored with Religious Worſhip:</hi> But this is only his Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Canon ſpeaks not one word of Worſhiping Martyrs; but only, whereas the Orthodox Chriſtian Aſſemblies were generally in the Burial places of true Martyrs, where they offered up Prayers to God: Some it ſeems began to make ſeparate Meetings in Places dedicated to Falſe Martyrs, and therefore the propereſt Note here would have been, to have ſet out the Sin of Schiſm, and the Pious Fraud (as they call it) of feigning falſe Martyrs, of which their Church is highly guilty. The Thirty fifth Canon expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids <hi>leaving the Church of God, and calling upon Angels;</hi> which they ſay is <hi>an hidden kind of Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking Chriſt the Son of God, to go after Idolatry.</hi> And <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who lived ſoon after the true time of this Council, ſaith, <hi>Thoſe who were for</hi> Moſes'<hi>s Law, which was given by Angels, brought in the Worſhip of them; which Error reigned long in</hi> Phrygia <hi>and</hi> Piſidia; <hi>and therefore the Councill of</hi> Laodicea, <hi>in</hi> Phrygia, <hi>did by a

Which Canon doth ſo evidently condemn the Roman Churches Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the Angels as Idolatry, that the former Editors of the Councils impudently corrupted the Text of this Canon, and put in <hi>Angulos,</hi> for <hi>Angelos</hi>

And firſt, The Notes dare not produce the place of <hi>Theodoret</hi> at large; then they ſtrive to blunder the Reader with a diſtinction of <hi>Dulia</hi> and <hi>Latria,</hi> which can ſignifie nothing here, becauſe the Canon and <hi>Theodoret</hi> both ſay, <hi>It is Praying to Angels which is forbid;</hi> and that the Romaniſts certainly do. Again, <hi>Baronius</hi> cenſures <hi>Theodoret</hi> for ſaying, <hi>That ſuch Heretics as were for</hi> Moſes'<hi>s Law, brought in</hi> ANGEL-Worſhip: But why doth he not cenſure S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>That thoſe who were Jewiſhly inclined, and obſerved differences of Meats, New-Moons and Sabbaths, were the Inventers of Angel-Worſhip</hi>

The Angelic-Heretics in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> who came in afterwards, did not (as the Notes repreſent them) ſay, <hi>That Angels were to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped with the Worſhip due to God alone:</hi> Only as the Romaniſts now are, ſo they were <hi>inclined to Worſhip Angels</hi>

However, we Proteſtants ſay with <hi>Theodoret, We neither give them Divine Worſhip, nor divide the Service due to the Divine Majeſty, between them and the true God</hi>

That the Angels, which this Council ſays, must not be Worſhiped, were not good Angels, but Devils and the</hi> Genii, <hi>adored by the Pagans; For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the former Canon receives the Worſhip of the true Martyrs, and rejects that of falſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:108925:48"/>
Martyrs.</hi> To which I Anſwer, firſt, It is falſe (as was ſhewed) that the former Canon receives the Worſhip of any Martyrs, true or falſe. Secondly, Why doth not this Canon call theſe <hi>Pſeudo-Angels,</hi> as the former called thoſe it rejected, <hi>Pſeudo-Martyrs,</hi> if the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions were of the ſame kind? Did ever any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian call Devils, Angels, without ſome addition, <hi>as Evil Angels, Apoſtate Angels, &amp;c?</hi> Beſides, in that Age when this Council was held (according to <hi>Baronius)</hi> the worſhip of <hi>Daemons</hi> and the Tutelar Spirits, was public, not ſecret Idolatry; ſo that it is manifeſt, this Canon ſpeaks not to Pagans, but Heretical Chriſtians. And <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſhews, That it was thoſe Angels, who gave the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which were hereby forbid to be Prayed to; and I hope neither <hi>Binius,</hi> nor his Maſter, will ſay, theſe were Devils: Wherefore this Canon plainly ſaith, <hi>Praying to good Angels,</hi> (as They of <hi>Rome</hi> now do) <hi>is Idolatry.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To conclude, The Sixtieth Canon of this Council, is the moſt ancient Account of the Canon of Scripture, that ever was made by any Chriſtian Synod, being the ſame which the Church of <hi>England</hi> holds at this day; for it leaves out all thoſe Books of <hi>Judith, Tobit, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, &amp;c.</hi> which we account not to be Canonical; but our Annotator finding ſo Primitive a Council con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting their new <hi>Trent</hi> Canon, and not being able to reconcile the difference, paſſeth this remarkable Canon by, without any Note.</p>
                        <p>§. 16. The reproachful Obſcurity of <hi>Sylveſter</hi> in this time of Action, in all other Chriſtian Churches, puts the Editors upon giving us an heap of Forgeries toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to colour over the Pope's doing nothing Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for Nine or Ten years: Firſt, We have an Epiſtle of the Primitive Church, and <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence <note n="o" place="margin">

Firſt, That it is a Fiction appears from divers Arguments: For, Firſt, who can believe <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſo unjuſt, firſt, to give <hi>Rome</hi> and the Weſtern Empire to the Pope, and then to one of his Sons? Or who can think the Pope ſo tame never to put in his Claim? Secondly, This Edict
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108925:49"/>
is grounded on the idle Story of <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Baptiſin by <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> which out of <hi>Sylveſter</hi>'s Fabulous Acts is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated at large in it; but thoſe Acts being (as was ſhewed) a meer Forgery, this Edict muſt be ſo alſo. Thirdly, It repreſents <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who was born and brought up under Chriſtian Parents, and had ſetled Chriſtianity before this, as a meer Heathen, till he met with <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter</hi> at this time. Fourthly, It pretends the whole Senate and all the Nobles joyned with the Emperor, to give the Pope this Power. But beſides the folly of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s delegating more Power than ever he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had, it is moſt falſe to ſuppoſe, That the whole Senate at this time were Chriſtians; for many of them continued Pagans long after <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Death. <hi>Baronius</hi> indeed (out of <hi>Sylvester</hi>'s Acts) affirms, <hi>That none of the Senate was converted before the Year</hi> 324 <note n="t" place="margin">
                              <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 324. §. 76.</note>. Forgetting that he had told us, <hi>Divers Senators had given up their Names to Chriſt Twelve years before</hi> 
                           <note n="u" place="margin">Id. An. 312. §. 75, &amp; 76.</note>; and that one or both of the Conſuls were Chriſtians two years before this <note n="w" place="margin">Id. An. 322. §. 1.</note>. So ill a Memory had the great Cardinal, when his Cauſe obliged him to defend a Lye. Fifthly, It ſpeaks of the Emperor's intending to build a City, and call it by his own Name, in the Province of <hi>Bizantium,</hi> and his Reſolution to transfer his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire thither; and yet before this, the Edict had reckoned up <hi>Constantinople</hi> by name, and <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> as two of the Five Patriarchates, and given <hi>Rome</hi> Juriſdiction over all the other Four. Laſtly, It is Dated in the Fourth Conſulſhip of <hi>Constantine</hi> with <hi>Gallicanus,</hi> whereas <hi>Licinius</hi> was his Collegue in his Fourth Conſulſhip, which was in the Year of Chriſt 315, that is, Nine years before the time fixed by <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> for this pretended Baptiſm; and that clearly ſhews the Story to be all Sham, as all modeſt and learned Men of the Roman Church do now acknowledge: But <hi>Baronius,</hi> and our Annotator, conſidering not barely the falſhood of this Edict, (for that alone would not diſcourage them;) but obſerving alſo, that it deſtroys the pretended Divine Right of the Pope's
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108925:49"/>
Supremacy, grant it at laſt to be a Forgery, but ſay, It was deviſed by the Greeks. Secondly, Therefore I ſhall ſhew the Falſhood of that Accuſation: For, Firſt, they charge <hi>Balſamon</hi> with publiſhing it; Now he did not write till <hi>An.</hi> 1180, yet the Notes out of <hi>Baronius</hi> do confeſs, that a Pope quoted it <hi>An.</hi> 1054, (that is, near an Hundred years before <hi>Balſamon</hi> was born) to juſtifie his Superiority over the Greek Church; and therefore <hi>Balſamon</hi> was not the Inventer of it: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, It doth the Greeks no good, for it gives the Pope power over all their Patriarchs, and reckons <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> as the laſt and loweſt Patriarchate, ſo that the Forger could not come out of that Church. Thirdly, It is grounded on the fabulous Acts of <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter,</hi> writ in Latin, and feigned in the Weſtern World; and its whole deſign is to advance the Pope above all Biſhops, Kings, and Emperors; and therefore no doubt it was advanced by a Friend of the Popes. Fourthly, The Notes confeſs, <hi>That a Pope firſt ſet up this Edict, to prove his Univerſal Supremacy,</hi> (not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering with <hi>Baronius,</hi> it ſeems, that it weakened his Title) <hi>and the grave and learned Men of the Roman Church received it as Authentic for many Ages after.</hi> We add, That till the Reformation they cited it, and writ in defence of it; and though now their Point is gained they begin to renounce it, yet the Advantage that Church got by it, ſhews, that they were the Forgers of it; yea, it ſeems <hi>Anno</hi> 1339 one <hi>Johannes Diaconus,</hi> a Member of the Roman Church, was thought to be the Author of it. Fifthly, Whoever conſiders how unwilling the Cardinal and our Annotator are to have it clearly rejected, will be convinced, that their Church gained by it, and conſequently invented it. They labour to prove, <hi>the Popes temporal Power granted hereby, is both probable and true</hi>

They alſo would make out what it ſaith of the Images of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> then kept at <hi>Rome,</hi> by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> but cite him falſly, leaving out the main part of his Teſtimony; <hi>viz.

Quite contrary! The Preface to the <hi>Sardican</hi> Council is of the Editors, or their Friends making, and ſo is no Proof: <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> ſaith, Hoſius <hi>was a Prince in the Synods;</hi> but not that he was Preſident of this Synod, or the Pope's Legate. <hi>Cedrenus</hi> and <hi>Photius</hi> are too late Authors to out-weigh more Ancient and Authentic Writers; yet they do not ſay, (as the Notes pretend) <hi>That</hi> Sylveſter, <hi>by his Legates, gave Authority to this Council:</hi> Yea, <hi>Photius.</hi> places the Biſhop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> before <hi>Sylvester</hi> and <hi>Julius,</hi> even when he is ſpeaking of the Chief Biſhops, who met at <hi>Nice;</hi> and he is groſly miſtaken alſo, becauſe neither of the Popes did meet there <note n="s" place="margin">

                        <p>Thirdly, As to the Power which confirmed the Canons of this Council; the ancient Hiſtorians do ſuppoſe that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> gave theſe Decrees their binding Power, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord his Letters, to injoyn all to obſerve them <note n="g" place="margin">Vid <hi>Socrat.

The Notes further urge, a Roman Council under Pope <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> to prove his Confirming theſe Canons; but that Council is a confeſſed Forgery it ſelf, and ſo proves nothing <note n="p" place="margin">
                              <hi>Labbè</hi> marg. pag. 412.</note>. Laſtly, The Annotator here (and almoſt every where) cites <hi>Socrates</hi> his ſpeaking of <hi>an Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Canon, that no Decrees of Councils ſhould be valid without the conſent of the Roman Biſhop</hi> 
                           <note n="q" place="margin">
                              <hi>Socrat.</hi> hiſtor. lib. 2. cap. 13.</note>. But Firſt, Conſent is not Confirmation; It is the priviledge of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Patriarch as well as of him of <hi>Rome,</hi> That a General Council cannot be held without every one of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents; but this proves not their pretended ſole and ſupreme Power of ratifying all Councils veſted in the Pope: Beſides, <hi>Socrates</hi> here only Hiſtorically relates what Pope <hi>Julius</hi> ſaid in his own Caſe; and therefore the Teſtimony relies on <hi>Julius</hi> his Credit; and indeed that was a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Caſe, wherein, when the Cauſe of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was referred by conſent of all parties to <hi>Julius</hi> as Arbitrator, the <hi>Arians</hi> took it out of his Hands againſt <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Mind; and judged it in a Council, to which <hi>Julius</hi> was not at all ſummoned, which doubtleſs was very illegal and unjuſt: But yet none can tell, where this Eccleſiaſtical Canon was made, which the angry and injured Pope here cites; and therefore till it appear whence <hi>Julius</hi> had this Canon, we muſt be excuſed, if we give no great Deference to it; and unleſs they cou'd prove it was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, it is very impertinent to expect the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers ſhould Govern their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by it. So that we conclude not <hi>Sylvester,</hi> but <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> confirmed this Council.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, As to the number of the Canons the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notator alſo notoriouſly prevaricates; He confeſſes <hi>that all the Greeks,</hi> and particularly <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Ruffinus, aſſert there were but Twenty Canons made there;</hi> yea, that the Sixth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> (within leſs than an Hundred years,) <hi>after a diligent ſearch in the three Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal Seats of</hi> Alexandria, Antioch <hi>and</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>could find no more than Twenty Canons</hi>

                              <hi>Lab.</hi> p. 71. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 395. col. 2.</note>: But the Notes conceal <hi>Gratian</hi>'s naming no more but Twenty Canons, and his ſaying, <hi>there are but only Twenty Nicene Canons to be

For all this the Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor boldly tells us, <hi>That the truer Opinion, (or rather that which is moſt for the Popes interest) is, that more than Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Canons were made there:</hi> But we will examine his and <hi>Baronius</hi>'s reaſons <note n="t" place="margin">
                              <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 325. §. 157. &amp;c.</note>. Firſt, They ſay there is no Decree about <hi>Eaſter</hi> among the Twenty Canons: I reply, There is a genuine Epiſtle of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s, in which this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is determined with the reaſons for it, which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a bare Law without Arguments, in a caſe which had been ſo much diſputed <note n="u" place="margin">

                           <note n="w" place="margin">
                              <hi>Ambroſ.</hi> ep. 82. ad Epiſc.

Thirdly, They plead, there was a Decree about the Canon of Scripture made at <hi>Nice,</hi> (which is not among theſe Twenty) becauſe S. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith, <hi>he had Read that the Nicene Fathers computed</hi> Judith, <hi>among the Books of Holy Scripture.</hi> I reply—S. <hi>Hierom</hi> only ſaith <hi>they computed it among Holy Writings,</hi> that is, (as we ſhewed before § 15.) <hi>among Books to be Read for inſtruction, not to be quoted in Diſpute:</hi> For if S. <hi>Hierom</hi> had believed this Council did receive <hi>Judith</hi> for Canonical, he would not have counted it (as he doth to be Apocryphal; So that this proves not that there were more Canons. Fourthly, The Notes affirm <hi>there is no Canon now extant here,</hi> againſt a Biſhops chooſing his Succeſſor in his Life time; which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith was forbid in this Council <note n="x" place="margin">
                              <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> Epiſt. 110.</note>; which is a groſs Untruth, ſince the Eighth Canon forbids two Biſhops ſhould be in one City; and the Notes own this was the very Canon meant by S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in the next Leaf <note n="y" place="margin">

only refers to a former <hi>African</hi> Synod, which had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed this, and not to the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> Sixthly, The Annotator ſpeaks of a Canon about Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> cited out of this <hi>Synod</hi> in the Sixth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> but he was wiſer than to tell us who cited this for a <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon; for it was Pope <hi>Zoſimus</hi>'s Legate cited it, and he was convicted of a notorious Falſification therein, as ſhall be ſhewed in due place. Seventhly, He ſaith there was a Canon made at <hi>Nice;</hi> but not to be found among the Twenty, <hi>that a Cauſe tried in a leſſer Synod, might be judged over again in a greater;</hi> and for this he cites the Fourth Epiſtle of <hi>Julius;</hi> but in his Notes on that Epiſtle <note n="a" place="margin">

Laſtly, the Annotator cites <hi>Sozomen,</hi> to proves that the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council added to the <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> the later part, <hi>As it was in the beginning,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas <hi>Sozomen</hi>

Fifthly, As to the Senſe of thoſe Canons, which oppoſe the Pope's Intereſt, the Notes uſe many Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures in expounding them. The Third Canon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids <hi>the Clergy to cohabit with Women taken into their Houſes; unleſs they were ſo near of Kin, as to avoid Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion and Scandal:</hi> Which plainly ſuppoſes, that they might have Wives, becauſe cohabiting with them, could give no Suſpicion nor Scandal: And ſince the Canon names not <hi>Wives,</hi> who were the moſt likely to dwell with their Husbands, doubtleſs this Council did not ſuppoſe the cohabitation of the Clergy with their Wives to be unlawful.

The Sixth Canon reckons the Pope but Equal to other great Biſhops, and limits his Juriſdiction; at which the Annaliſt and Annotator are much diſcompoſed, and (by various Fictions and ſhuffling Pretences) labour to pervert the true Senſe of this famous Canon.

were under the Praefect of</hi> Rome; <hi>that is, ſome part of</hi> Italy, <hi>and ſome of the adjacent Iſlands;</hi> and theſe were all the Churches which were then under the Pope's Juriſdiction: As may appear by the great difficulty which the ſucceeding Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> found in the following Ages, to bring <hi>Milan, Aquileia,</hi> and <hi>Ravenna</hi> (Churches in <hi>Italy</hi> it ſelf) to be in ſubjection to them: So that the Pope was ſo far from having an Univerſal Supremacy then, that <hi>Balſamon</hi> is miſtaken in thinking he was made Patriarch of all the Weſtern Church; for the very Fifth Canon, which <hi>orders all Cauſes to be heard and finally ended in the ſame Province where they hapned,</hi> not only deſtroys Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> but ſhews that no Biſhop did then pretend to ſo large a Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

Fourthly, Whereas the Ninth Canon of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> allows the Clergy to complain to the Primate, or to the Biſhop of the Royal City of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> Notes are put upon this to falſifie that Canon, which ſay, That <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> is here put for <hi>Rome</hi>

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108925:56"/>
a Forgery of ſome Roman Paraſite, becauſe it not only contradicts the Sixth Canon of the genuine Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> but the Eighth of theſe pretended Canons, which limits the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Juriſdiction to the Places near to him <note n="a" place="margin">

However, the Editors ſay, <hi>Steuchus, Turrian,</hi> and <hi>Cope</hi> cite it; and they print <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>'s Notes upon it, which affirm it to agree with the Sixth Canon of the true Edition; and would prove it genuine by no better Evidence, than a Forged Decretal of <hi>Anacletus</hi>

                        <p>Laſtly, We will make ſome Remarks on the Corrupt Editions of this Council: Firſt, That of <hi>Alfonſus Piſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> is ſo Fabulous, that <hi>Labbé</hi> for meer ſhame omits it <note n="c" place="margin">
                              <hi>Lab.</hi> Marg. pag. 106.</note>; but <hi>Binius</hi> prints it at large, with all its Fictions and Impoſtures <note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 300. col. 1.</note>; of which <hi>Richerius</hi> gives this Character, <hi>By this Hiſtory of</hi> Piſanus <hi>we may learn, not what the Council of</hi> Nice <hi>was, but what it ſhould be to fit it for a Jeſuits Palate; for he hath ſcraped together all the Falſhoods and Forgeries he could find, for enlarging the number of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> 
                           <note n="e" place="margin">
                              <hi>Richer.</hi> hiſt. Concil. lib. 1. cap. 2. §. ult.</note>. But I muſt add, that there are divers Paſſages in this Edition, which will not ſerve the ends of the modern Roman Flatterers: For firſt, <hi>Piſanus</hi> his Greek Author highly extols <hi>Euſebius</hi> 
                           <note n="f" place="margin">
                              <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 301. col. 2. &amp; 302. col. 2.</note>; for which the Jeſuit corrects him with a Note in the Margen. Secondly, The Orthodox Biſhop bids the Philoſopher <hi>believe that which was written, but not to regard things unwritten; becauſe the Faith is grounded on Holy Scripture</hi> 
                           <note n="g" place="margin">
                              <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 316. col. 1.</note>: Whereas the Margen cautions the Reader, not to think that <hi>this is ſpoken againſt Eccleſiaſtical Traditions,</hi> though it be levelled at them. Thirdly, <hi>Hoſius</hi> doth not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe (as the Pope's Legates here do) <hi>for Pope</hi> Sylveſter; wherefore this Compiler did not think him to be the Popes Legate <note n="h" place="margin">
                              <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 322. col. 1.</note>. Fourthly, It is here ſaid to have been declared at <hi>Nice, That every Biſhop under God was the Head of his own Church</hi> 
                           <note n="i" place="margin">
                              <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 325. col. 2.</note>. Fifthly, Here is printed that part of the <hi>African</hi> Biſhop's Letter to <hi>Celeſtine,</hi> wherein they blame his Legate for falſly citing the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:108925:57"/>
                           <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons <note n="k" place="margin">
                              <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 328. col. 1.</note>. So alſo the LXXX Canons were not invented by a Through-paced Friend to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Modern Intereſt, and therefore probably <hi>Baronius</hi> will not defend them <note n="l" place="margin">Baron. <hi>An.</hi> 325. §. 53.</note>. The <hi>8th</hi> Canon (as was noted) limits the Pope's Juriſdiction to ſuch places as were near him: The <hi>24th</hi> and <hi>66th</hi> of theſe Canons clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that ſome Biſhops had Wives <note n="m" place="margin">
                              <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 335. col. 2. &amp; p. 341. col. 1.</note>, forbidding Bigamy, and compelling them to take their firſt Wife again. And there are other like Examples which are not worth ſetting down, becauſe they are all forged in later times, as appears by their citing a fabulous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe out of the Life of S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> falſly aſcribed to the great <hi>Athanaſius</hi> 
                           <note n="n" place="margin">
                              <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 302. col. 2. Vid. <hi>Rivet.</hi> Cait. ſacr. l. 3. cap. 4.</note>, by their quoting a ſpurious Work under the name of <hi>Dionyſius Areopagita,</hi> which was (as all agree) writ after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council many years <note n="o" place="margin">
                              <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 336. col. 2.</note>: By their giving the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi> Juriſdiction over the Archbiſhop of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> who was always free from that ſubjection, as was declared long after in the Council of <hi>Epheſus</hi> 
                           <note n="p" place="margin">
                              <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 337. col. 1. Vid. Concil. <hi>Epheſin.</hi> Act. 7.</note>. Finally, Though this <hi>Piſanus</hi> do impudently reject the true ſtory of <hi>Paph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius</hi> his adviſing to leave the Clergy at liberty to Marry; which Hiſtory is in his Author, and in <hi>Gelaſius Cyzicenus</hi> alſo: Yet he magnifies a ridiculous Fiction afterward of two <hi>Biſhops, which ſigned the</hi> Nicene <hi>Faith after they were dead and buried</hi> 
                           <note n="q" place="margin">
                              <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 347. col. 2.</note>. A Fable ſo groſs, that <hi>Baronius</hi> rejects it, with a Note which I wiſh he had often remembred, <hi>viz. That it was not uſual Among Chriſtians to confirm the Faith by Miracles, which was attested by more firm Evidences of Holy Scripture</hi> 
                           <note n="r" place="margin">Baron. <hi>An.</hi> 325. §. 182.</note>. Secondly, <hi>Turrians</hi> Edition of this Council repeats all theſe LXXX Canons, and in his Preface and his Notes he vindicates them all; and yet the Tracts which he cites to prove theſe Canons genuine, are owned to be ſpurious by all modeſt Romaniſts, and his Arguments are ſo trifling they are not worth conſuting. We will only note therefore, that the <hi>7th</hi> and the <hi>40th</hi> of theſe Canons require, that Synods ſhall be held twice a year, which (as <hi>Turrian</hi> confeſſeth) agrees not with the cuſtom of the Roman Church <note n="s" place="margin">
                              <hi>Lab.</hi> p. 294. &amp; pag. 303. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 353. col. 2. &amp; 358. col. 1.</note>: And his Notes ſay,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:108925:57"/>
the <hi>72d</hi> Canon differs from the <hi>13th,</hi> and the <hi>73d</hi> Canon is contrary to the <hi>49th</hi> 
                           <note n="t" place="margin">
                              <hi>Lab.</hi> p. 315. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 363. col. 1, &amp; 2.</note>; but he will rather ſuppoſe the Holy <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers contradicted themſelves, than own any of theſe Canons to be forged, becauſe ſome of them ſeem to favour the Pope's Supremacy. As to the Edition of <hi>Gelaſius Cyzicenus,</hi> it is generally a very modeſt account of this Council, and hath not many Errors in it, but like all other ancient Authors it ſpeaks very little of the Pope; for which Reaſon <hi>Binius</hi> claps it under Hatches, and will not produce it till the latter end of his Second Tome after the Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to convince us, That all Authors are valued or ſlighted meerly as they promote or diſcourage the Uſurpations of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>§. 18. To all theſe Impoſtures, contrived to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent this famous general Council, there is tacked <hi>a Third Council at</hi> Rome <hi>under</hi> Sylveſter <hi>in the preſence of</hi> Conſtantine, <hi>wherein that Pope with 275 Biſhops are ſaid to confirm the</hi> Nicene <hi>Council, and make two or three new Canons</hi> 
                           <note n="u" place="margin">
                              <hi>Lab.</hi> p. 412. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 365. col. 1. <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 325. §. 199.</note>. But though it be certain and confeſſed by <hi>Binius</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was not then at <hi>Rome,</hi> though the Style be barbarous, and the Matter frivolous, and the thing be a manifeſt Forgery contrived to carry on the grand Cheat of <hi>Sylveſter</hi>'s confirming the Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> yet <hi>Barcnius</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> (who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Title to be falſe) labour to prove this <hi>Synod</hi> to be true, though <hi>Binius</hi> be forced to juſtifie it by the forged Letter of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers to <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> and his Anſwer to them, both which in the next Column he owns are falſe and feigned <note n="w" place="margin">
                              <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 365. col. 2 C</note>. And thus where the Supremacy is concern'd, one Forgery ſerves for the Evidence of another.</p>
                        <p>The Council at <hi>Gangra</hi> is genuine, and was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted Remain of Primitive Antiquity, till it fell into the hands of theſe Editors, who have put the name of <hi>Oſius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Corduba,</hi> into the Title in their Latin Verſion; and though that Name be not found in the Original Greek printed over againſt it; yet from
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:108925:58"/>
this Fiction of their own <note n="x" place="margin">
                              <hi>Lab.</hi> p. 414. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 366. col. 1.</note> the Notes impudently ſay, <hi>That this Synod was Convened by</hi> Sylveſter'<hi>s Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and from</hi> Oſius <hi>his preſence in it,</hi> Binius <hi>certainly gathers it was celebrated under this Pope;</hi> but a little after he knows not in what year it was held; and <hi>Baronius</hi> treats of this Council <hi>Anno</hi> 361, that is, near 30 years after <hi>Sylveſter</hi>'s Death <note n="y" place="margin">

They tell us that Pope <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi> in his <hi>6th</hi> Roman Council approves this Synod, but he mentions not <hi>Oſius;</hi> however <hi>Baronius</hi> gueſſes, that the reaſon why <hi>Symmachus</hi> approved it was, <hi>becauſe</hi> Oſius <hi>the Legate of the Apoſtolic See was there;</hi> which groundleſs Conjecture and falſe Aſſertion, <hi>Binius</hi> in his Notes turns into a poſitive Affirmation, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Oſius</hi> was there as the Pope's Legate. As to the occaſion of calling this Council of <hi>Gangra,</hi> it was to condemn one <hi>Euſtathius,</hi> whom <hi>Binius</hi> owns to have been a great Favourer of Monkiſh life, and <hi>Sozomen</hi> ſaith, he was a Monk <note n="z" place="margin">
                              <hi>Sozom.</hi> lib. 3. cap. 13.</note>; yea, the Synodical Epiſtle deſcribes him as one who deſpiſed Marriage, allowed not the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations of Married Prieſts, who had a ſeparate way of Worſhip, and a different garb from others, making his Followers to abſtain from Fleſh, profeſs Continency, and renounce Propriety <note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 367, &amp;c.</note>; all which are the very Characters of a Monk of the Roman ſtamp; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is wonder that <hi>Binius</hi> ſhould give <hi>Sozomen</hi> and himſelf the Lye, and ſay he was no propagator of Monkery, and that it cannot be proved that he was a Monk; yet at laſt he fancies <hi>Euſtathius</hi> his Name was miſtaken for <hi>Eutachus</hi> an <hi>Armenian</hi> Monk <note n="b" place="margin">

                              <hi>Socrat.</hi> lib. 2 cap. 16.</note>, yet ſo few came to it, and they who came agreed ſo ill (the Eaſtern Biſhops generally forſaking it) that it is called frequently, <hi>A Council of the Western Church,</hi> and ſo <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in <hi>Baronius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it <note n="l" place="margin">

                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The little regard paid to its Canons after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhews it was no General Council. <hi>Richerius,</hi> a moderate and learned Romaniſt proves, <hi>That this Council was not extant in Greek in the time of</hi> Dionyſius Exiguus, <hi>ſo that he and Pope</hi> Leo <hi>the</hi> 4th <hi>reckon it after all the Councils of Note: The Greeks received not its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons into their Code, and Pope</hi> Nicholas <hi>Epiſtle ſhows, that the Eaſtern Church did not value its Authority, only the Popes esteemed it, becauſe it ſeems to advance their power</hi> 
                           <note n="m" place="margin">
                              <hi>Richer.</hi> hiſt. Concil. lib. 1. cap. 3.</note>. The <hi>African</hi> Church of old valued this Council as little; for a Synod of Biſhops there (among whom were S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Alypius)</hi> were ignorant of any <hi>Sardican</hi> Council, but one held by the <hi>Arians. Baronius</hi> tries all his art to palliate this matter <note n="n" place="margin">
                              <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 347. §. 73.</note>; but after all his Conjectures it is plain, it was of no repute
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:108925:64"/>
in <hi>Africa,</hi> becauſe when two Popes <hi>Zoſimus</hi> and <hi>Boniface</hi> afterwards cited the Decrees of <hi>Sardica</hi> as Canons of <hi>Nice,</hi> the Fraud was diſcovered, and when they were found not to be <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons, They would not receive them as Canons of <hi>Sardica,</hi> but flatly rejected them; which ſhews, that theſe <hi>African</hi> Fathers did neither take this <hi>Sardican</hi> Synod for a General Council, nor for an Authentic Provincial Council: And therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is here ſaid in favour of the Roman Church, is of no great weight. However the Champions of <hi>Rome</hi> magnifie the <hi>4th</hi> Canon of this Council, where in caſe a Biſhop judge that he is condemned unjuſtly, <hi>Hoſius</hi> ſaith, <hi>If it pleaſe you, let us honour the memory of</hi> Peter <hi>the Apostle, and let thoſe who have judged ſuch a Biſhop write to</hi> Julius <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>that ſo (if need be) the Judgment may be reviewed by the Biſhops of the Province, and he may appoint ſome to hear the Cauſe, &amp;c.</hi> Now here the Notes talk big, and claim a Supremacy and Appeals as due to the Pope by Divine Right <note n="o" place="margin">

                           <note n="p" place="margin">
                              <hi>Richer.</hi> hiſt. Con. lib. 1. cap. 3.</note>. And we add, that <hi>Hoſius</hi> neither cites any Divine Law, no nor any precedent Canon or Cuſtom for this, but ſuppoſes it at the pleaſure of this Synod to grant or deny <hi>Julius</hi> this privilege: And yet if it were an expreſs Law, this being only a Weſtern Synod, doth not bind the whole Catholic Church. Beſides, it is not ſaid, <hi>The Criminal ſhall appeal to</hi> Rome, <hi>and have his Cauſe tryed there;</hi> but only, that the Pope (if need were) might order the Cauſe to be heard over again in the Province where it was firſt tryed; and therefore <hi>Julius</hi> is only made a Judge of the neceſſity of a Re hearing, not of the Cauſe it ſelf, which according to the <hi>5th</hi> Canon of <hi>Nice</hi> was to be decided in the Province where it was firſt moved. And this rather condemns than counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances the modern Popiſh way of Trying foreign Cauſes at <hi>Rome</hi> by Appeal. To this I will add an ancient Scholion on this Canon found in ſome old
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:108925:64"/>
Copies: <hi>From this Canon the Roman Church is much exalted with Pride; and former evil Popes producing this as a Canon of</hi> Nice, <hi>were diſcovered by a Council at</hi> Carthage, <hi>as the Preface to that Council ſhews: But this Canon (whatever they pretend) gives no more power to</hi> Rome <hi>than other Canons, ſince it ſaith not abſolutely, that any who is depoſed any where ſhall have liberty to appeal to the Pope; for at that rate the</hi> Sardican <hi>Synod would contradict the General Councils; it ſpeaks only of him who is depoſed by the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Biſhops and thoſe of his Province, and therefore doth not comprehend the Synod of the Primate Metropolitan, or Patriarch; ſo that if they be preſent, and the Sentence be not barely by the Neighbouring Biſhops, the Pope may not re-hear it, as this Canon orders: And it only concerns thoſe in the Weſt,</hi> Hoſius <hi>and the Makers of theſe Canons being of thoſe parts; but in the Eaſt this Custom never was obſerved to this day</hi>

§. 22. The firſt Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> was appointed to <note place="margin">An Dom. 348.</note> ſuppreſs that dangerous Sect of the Donatiſts; and though it bear the Title of <hi>under Julius,</hi> yet this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended univerſal Monarch is not mentioned by the Council, or by any ancient Author, as having any hand in this great Work, which was managed by <hi>Gratus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and by the Emperours Legates <note n="e" place="margin">
                              <hi>Lab.</hi> p. 713. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 546. col. 1.</note>. In this Council were made fourteen excellent Canons, which poſſibly the Romaniſts may reject, becauſe they never asked the Popes conſent to hold this Council, nor deſired his confirmation to their Canons; and whereas the Editors tell us, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> (who lived five hundred years after) approved of this Council, we muſt obſerve that the Catholic Church had put them into their Code, and received them for Authentic long before, without ſtaying for any Approbation from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Soon after this, there was a Council at <hi>Milan,</hi> of which there was no mention, but only in the Synodical Letter of the Biſhops met at <hi>Ariminum, An.</hi> 359. <note n="f" place="margin">

There was alſo a peculiar reaſon why theſe two Heretics went thither, and it cannot be proved that this Council ſent them; ſo that theſe are Forgeries, deviſed to ſupport their dear Supremacy, and ſo we leave them: Only noting, That the Editors are not ſo happy in their Memory as their Invention; for the next Page ſhews us a Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> wherein many Biſhops (who had deſcribed the Condemnation of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and therefore no doubt were <hi>Arians)</hi> repented and recanted, and ſo were reſtored to the Churches Communion, without the trouble of going to <hi>Rome</hi> on this Errant.</p>
                        <p>A Council at <hi>Colen</hi> follows next, which they ſay <hi>was in</hi> Julius <hi>his time, and under</hi> Julius; yet the Notes ſay, they know not the time when it was held, only the Biſhops there aſſembled depoſed a Biſhop for Hereſie by their own Authority, without ſtaying for the Pope's Advice, though they were then about to ſend a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to <hi>Rome</hi> to pray for them; ſo little was the Popes Conſent thought needful in that Age; and perhaps it is in order to conceal this ſeeming neglect, that the Notes <note n="h" place="margin">

                        <p>In <hi>Liberius's</hi> firſt year it is ſaid, <hi>There was a Council called at</hi> Rome <hi>by this Pope, to clear</hi> Athanaſius <note n="f" place="margin">

Therefore if this was a General Council, it was called by the Emperour, and not by the Pope: In the Notes on this Synod they ſay, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius <hi>being yet a Catechumen, ought not to be preſent at a lawful Council.</hi> But this is <hi>Baronius</hi> his device, to colour over the Forgery of <hi>Conſtantine's</hi> Baptiſm before the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> there being no Canon forbidding a Catechumen to be preſent in a Council, or in a Church, except only while the Sacrament was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating; ſo that if <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had been bound by an Eccleſiaſtical Canon, there being no Canon to hinder his preſence in this Council, <hi>Baronius</hi> aſſigns a wrong

So unfortunate is their Supremacy, that whatever ſeems to give any countenance to it, always proves to be Forged.

all the good things which they had done;</hi> with which Letter probably they ſent (as was uſual) a Tranſcript of all their Acts: And <hi>Photius</hi> ſaith, <hi>That</hi> Damaſus, <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>afterwards agreed with theſe Biſhops, and confirmed what they had done</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Authority of this Council is undoubted, having been ever called and accounted the Second General Council, and ſo it is reckoned in all places where the General Councils are mentioned, which Title it had not, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> vainly ſuggeſts, <hi>Becauſe at the time when this was aſſembled in the Eaſt, the Weſtern Biſhops met at</hi> Rome: For that obſcure Synod is not taken notice of, while this is every where celebrated, as held at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and conſiſting of one hundred and fifty Biſhops, which were they who met in the Eaſt <note n="n" place="margin">

                           <note n="p" place="margin">Idem p. 382.</note>; and the Annotator makes it impoſſible <hi>for any Council to be general, unleſs the Pope or his Legates be there.</hi> Now he and all others call this <hi>A General Council:</hi> And yet he ſaith, <hi>That neither Pope</hi> Damaſus, <hi>nor his Legates were Preſidents of it, nor was he or any Weſtern Biſhop in it.</hi> Whence we learn, That there may be a General Council, at which the Pope is not preſent, by himſelf, nor by his Legates, and of which neither he nor they are Preſidents.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As to the Creed and Canons here made, the modern Romaniſts without any proof ſuppoſe, that <hi>Damaſus</hi> allowed the former, and not the later: But if he allowed the famous Creed here made, I ask, Whether it then had theſe words <hi>[And from the Son]</hi> or no? If it had, why do the Notes ſay, <hi>That theſe words were added to it by the Biſhops of</hi> Spain <hi>and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Pope</hi> Leo <hi>long after</hi> 
                           <note n="q" place="margin">
                              <hi>Lab.</hi> p. 972. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 543. col. 2.</note>? But if theſe words
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:108925:76"/>
were wanting, as they ſeem to confeſs, (when they ſay, <hi>The Roman Church long uſed this Creed without this addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)</hi> then I muſt deſire to know, how a Man of their Church can be ſecure of his Faith, if what was (as they ſay) confirmed by <hi>Damaſus</hi> in a General Council, may be al ered by a few Biſhops and another Pope, without any General Council? As to the Canons, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſus</hi> made no objection againſt them in his time, and it is very certain that the Biſhop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> after this Council, always had the ſecond place. For as the firſt General Council at <hi>Nice</hi> gave old <hi>Rome</hi> the firſt place, as being the Imperial City; ſo this ſecond General Council doubted not, but when <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> was become new <hi>Rome,</hi> and an Imperial City alſo; they had power to give it the ſecond place, and ſuitable Priviledges. Yea, the Notes confeſs, that S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſostom,</hi> by virtue of this Canon, placed and diſplaced divers Biſhops in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the <hi>4th</hi> General Council at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> (without regarding the diſſent of the Popes Legates) allowed the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> the ſecond place, and made his Priviledges equal to thoſe of Old <hi>Rome</hi>

Concil. <hi>Chalced.</hi> Can. 28. &amp; Subſcrip. ibid.</note>; which Precedence and Power that Biſhop long retained, notwithſtanding the endeavours of the envious Popes: And <hi>Gregory</hi> never objected againſt theſe Canons, till he began to fear the growing Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> but when that Church and Empire was ſinking, and there appeared no danger on that ſide to the Popes, then <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third is ſaid by the Notes, <hi>to revive and allow this Canon again;</hi> by which we ſee, that <hi>nothing but Intereſt governs that Church, and guides her Biſhops in allowing or diſcarding any Council:</hi> For now again, when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed begin to urge this Canon, <hi>Baronius</hi> and the Notes ſay, <hi>They can prove by firm Reaſons, that this Canon was forged by the Greeks:</hi> But their Reaſons are very frivolous, <hi>They ſay</hi> Anatolius <hi>did not quote this Canon against Pope</hi> Leo: I reply, 'Tis very probable he did, becauſe <hi>Leo</hi> ſaith, <hi>He pleaded the Conſent of many Biſhops;</hi> that is, (if <hi>Leo</hi> would have ſpoken out) <hi>In this General
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:108925:77"/>
Council.</hi> Secondly, They urge that this Canon is not mentioned in the Letter writ to <hi>Damaſus.</hi> I Anſwer, They have told us before, they ſent their Acts to him, and ſo need not repent them in this Letter. Thirdly, They talk of the Injury done to <hi>Timotheus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> but his Subſcription is put to the Canons as well as the Creed, and it doth not appear that ever he or any of his Succeſſors contended for Precedence after this, with the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> And that the Modern Greeks did not forge this Canon is plain, becauſe <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> both mention it <note n="s" place="margin">
                              <hi>Socrat.</hi> lib. 5. cap. 2. <hi>Sozem.</hi> lib 7. cap. 8.</note>; and the Catholic Church always owned it for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic. Yea, in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> it is declared, That the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ought to have had the ſecond place in the Factious Synod at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and he is reckoned in that fourth General Council next after the Pope, whoſe Legates were there, and yet durſt not deny him the ſecond place, in which he ſat and ſubſcribed in that order, having firſt had this Canon confirmed at <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> So that all Churches, but that of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſubmit to this General Council; and they who pretend moſt to venerate them, do deſpiſe and reject the Authority of General Councils, if they oppoſe the ends of their Pride and Avarice. To conclude, Here is a General Council called and confirmed only by the Emperour, aſſembled without the Pope or his Legates, decreeing Matters of Faith and of Diſcipline, yet every where owned and received as genuine, except at <hi>Rome,</hi> when Intereſt made them partial, and ſtill no leſs valued for that by all other Churches: Which gives a ſevere Blow to the modern Pretences of their Papal Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and Infallibility.</p>
                        <p>The ſame Year there was a Council at <hi>Aquileia</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> wherein divers <hi>Arians</hi> were fully heard and fairly condemned. Now this Council was called by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, the Preſidents of it being <hi>Valerian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Milan;</hi> but <hi>Damaſus</hi> is not named in it, nor was he preſent at it in Perſon, or by his Legates, though this Council was called in <hi>Italy</hi>

it ſelf, and deſigned to ſettle a Point of Faith: But theſe Biſhops (as the Acts ſhew) did not judge Heretics by the Popes Authority, but by Scripture and by ſolid Arguments: And they tell us, <hi>It was then a Cuſtom for the Eaſtern Biſhops to hold their Councils in the Eaſt, and the Weſtern theirs in the Weſt</hi>

                        <p>For this Pope are publiſhed divers Decretal Epiſtles, which are the firſt that can pretend to be genuine; and if they be really ſo, it is plain, that their Style is mean, the Arguments trifling, and the Scripture Proofs impertinent; ſo that the Author was no Conjurer. The firſt directed to <hi>Himerius</hi> is very ſevere againſt Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, eſpecially in the Clergy: The Notes would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us, <hi>It is not lawful Marriage, which he calls Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (as they ſay <hi>Calvin</hi> falſly affirms <note n="m" place="margin">

Again, he fooliſhly attempts to prove, Clergy-men ought not to Marry, becauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thoſe that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God;</hi> and though he confeſs it was uſual for many Clergy-men to live with their Wives, he calls that cohabitation, <hi>the being polluted with carnal Concupiſcence,</hi> in his <hi>4th</hi> Epiſtle: So that he is juſtly taxed with ſpeaking profanely of God's holy Ordinance, and of contradicting S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who excepted not the Clergy, when he ſaid, <hi>Marriage is honourable in all men, and the Bed undefiled,</hi> Hebr.

The Second Council at <hi>Arles</hi> is ſuppoſed to be held about this time, becauſe the Followers of <hi>Photinus</hi> and <hi>Bonoſus</hi> were there condemned: Wherefore they ſay, <hi>It was in the time of</hi> Siricius; but under him it could not be, ſince the Biſhops there aſſembled do not name him, nor do they except the Biſhop of <hi>Romes</hi> Supreme Power, when they refer all Eccleſiaſtical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the final deciſion of their own Metropolitan and his Synod, and declare, that every Biſhop who receives a perſon Excommunicated by another, ſhall be guilty of Schiſm. Yet the Editors are ſo apt to dote upon the Popes managing all Councils, that they here ſtyle a meeting of the <hi>Novatian</hi> Heretics at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garis</hi> in <hi>Bithynia</hi> 
                           <note n="x" place="margin">

                        </p>
                        <p>At this time there was a great Council at <hi>Hippo,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">An. Dom. 393.</note> which the Notes ſometimes call <hi>a General,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>a Plenary Council,</hi> becauſe moſt of the <hi>African</hi> Biſhops were there, and the Original dates it with the Conſuls of this year; but the Editors clap a New Title to it, ſaying, it was <hi>under Siricius;</hi> who in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity had no hand in it, nor knew any thing of it: Yet here were made many of thoſe famous Canons for Diſcipline, by which the <hi>African</hi> Church was governed. But they are more wary in the next Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> at which many Biſhops were preſent, and among them the two Patriarchs of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antioch;</hi> being ſummoned (in the abſence of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour) by his Prefect <hi>Ruffinus;</hi> and they will not
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:108925:81"/>
venture to ſay, <hi>This was</hi> under <hi>Siricius,</hi> for the Matters treated on it wholly related to the Eaſtern Church, and in that Age they rarely allowed the Pope to concern himſelf in their Affairs: No nor in <hi>Afric</hi> neither, where <hi>(Anno</hi> 395) there were Councils held both by the Orthodox and the Donatiſts, which are dated by the Conſuls, and no notice is taken of the Pope <note n="y" place="margin">

We ſhall only obſerve, that upon one of theſe Councils the Notes ſay, <hi>It is a mark of the</hi> Donatiſts, <hi>being of the Synagogue of Antichrist, that they named the ſeveral Parties among them from the Leaders and Founders of their ſeveral Sects, and were not content with the Name of</hi> Chriſtians <hi>from Chriſt.</hi> Which Note reflects upon the Monks of their own Church, who are called <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictines, Dominicans,</hi> and <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> from the Founders of their ſeveral Orders.</p>
                        <p>In the Council of <hi>Turin,</hi> compoſed of the <hi>Gallican</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">An.

Now, here the Roman Advocates are much diſturbed to find S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his Name before <hi>Siricius;</hi> and when they repeat this Paſſage in the Notes, they falſly ſet the Pope's Name firſt, contrary to the expreſs words of the fifth Canon, and impudently pretend, <hi>That the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>by his place, was the ordinary Judge who ſhould be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with, and</hi> Ambroſe <hi>was only made ſo by the Popes Delegation</hi>

But, how abſurd is it (if this were ſo) for the Council to place the Name of the Delegate, before his who gave him power? And every one may ſee, that this Council was directed to mark this Decree principally by S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his Advice, and ſecondarily by the Popes; for at that time <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his Fame and Intereſt was greater than that of <hi>Siricius;</hi> yet after all, the Council decreed this, not by the Authority of either of theſe Biſhops (as the Notes
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:108925:82"/>
pretend,) but only by their Information, and upon their Advice by theſe Letters, which were not firſt read (as they pretend) but after four other buſineſſes were diſpatched.</p>
                        <p>The Canons of divers <hi>African</hi> Councils, held at <hi>Carthage</hi> and elſewhere, have been put together long <note place="margin">An. Dom. 397, &amp;c.</note> ſince, and collected into one Code, which makes the time and order of the Councils wherein they were made, ſomewhat difficult; but ſince the Canons were always held Authentic, we need not (with the Editors) be much concerned for their exact order, or for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them to the years of the Pope, becauſe they were neither called nor ratified by his Authority. Yea, the Notes ſay, <hi>It was never heard that any, but the Biſhop of</hi> Carthage <hi>called a Council there, his Letters gave Summons to it, he preſided over it, and firſt gave his Suffrage in it,</hi>—and that <hi>even when</hi> Fauſtinus <hi>(an</hi> Italian <hi>Biſhop) the Popes Legate was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi>

As for the particular Canons of the third Council, the Nineteenth ſaith, <hi>That the Readers ſhall either profeſs Continence; or they ſhall be compelled to Marry;</hi> but they feign old Copies which ſay, <hi>They ſhall not be allowed to Read, if they will not contain</hi>

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                              <hi>Bin</hi> p. 580.</note>, on purpoſe to make us think, that the command of Celibacy (upon which that Age too much doted) reached the loweſt order of the Clergy, even Readers; contrary to the expreſs words of the Canons. And to the ſecond Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> where only <hi>Biſhops, Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> are under an obligation to live ſingle <note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 571.</note>. Secondly, The <hi>26th</hi> Canon of the third Council for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids the <hi>Biſhop of the first See,</hi> to be called by the Title <hi>of Prince,</hi> or <hi>Chief of Biſhops, (Gratian</hi> goes on) <hi>neither may the Roman Biſhop be called <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi>

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:108925:82"/>
no Patriarch ought to be called <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal.</hi> Beſides, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how apt the Editors are to ſtrike out words not Agreeable to the Intereſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is more probable that ſome of the Popes Friends lately left theſe words out, than that <hi>Gratian</hi> put them in: And ſince this Council <hi>forbid Appeals to foreign Judicatures with pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar reſpect to</hi> Rome, to which ſome of the Criminal Clergy then began to appeal <note n="f" place="margin">
                              <hi>Lab.</hi> p. 1171. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 581. col. 2.</note>, it is not unlikely theſe Fathers might reſolve to check as well the Title, as the Juriſdiction (then beginning to be ſet up) which encouraged theſe Appeals. Thirdly, The <hi>47th</hi> Canon in the Latin, and the <hi>24th</hi> in the Greek and Latin Edition, ſpeaking of ſuch Books, as are ſo far Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal that they may be read in Churches, reckon up ſome of thoſe Books which we call Apocryphal, upon which the Notes triumph <note n="g" place="margin">
                              <hi>Lab.</hi> p. 1177. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 580. col. 1.</note>; but let it be obſerved, that we grant ſome of theſe Books to be ſo far Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, that they may be read for inſtruction of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and alſo we may note, that the beſt Editions of theſe <hi>African</hi> Canons leave out all the Books of <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees</hi> and <hi>Baruch</hi> (which are foiſted into their later Latin Copies <note n="h" place="margin">
                              <hi>Coſen</hi>'s Hiſtory of the Canon p. 112. &amp; pag. 113.</note>). And it is plain, the whole Canon is falſly placed in this Council under <hi>Siricius,</hi> becauſe Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> (who came not into the Papacy till above twenty years after) is named in it as Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet after all theſe devices, it doth not declare what Books are ſtrictly Canonical, and ſo will not juſtifie the Decree at <hi>Trent.</hi> Fourthly, In the <hi>48th</hi> Canon of the Latin Verſion, the Council agrees to adviſe about the Donatiſts, with <hi>Stricius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Simplicianus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Milan,</hi> not giving any more deference to one of theſe Biſhops than to the other, but looking on them as equally fit to adviſe them: Yet the Notes boldly ſay, <hi>They adviſe with the Pope, becauſe they knew he preſided, as a Biſhop and Doctor, over the Catholic Church; but with the Biſhop of</hi> Milan <hi>only, as a Man every where famous for his Learning</hi> 
                           <note n="i" place="margin">
                              <hi>Lab.</hi> p. 1183. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 584. col. 2.</note>. Which is a meer Fiction of their own, for the words of the Canon ſhew, that theſe Fathers did not believe either of them
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:108925:83"/>
had any Authority over them, only they deſired their advice joyntly, as being both Eminent and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Biſhops, and their prohibiting Appeals ſhews, they knew nothing of the Popes preſiding over the Catholic Church.</p>
                        <p>§. 32. <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> was the laſt Pope in this Century, <note place="margin">An. Dom. 398.</note> of whom there would have been as little notice taken, as of Many of his Predeceſſors, if it had not been his good fortune to be known, both to S. <hi>Hierom</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and to aſſiſt the latter in ſuppreſſing the Donatiſts, and the former in condemning the Errours of <hi>Origen,</hi> for which cauſe theſe two Fathers make an honourable mention of him. Yet in the <hi>African</hi> Councils, where he is named with reſpect, they joyn <hi>Venerius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Milan</hi> with him, and call them <hi>Their Brethren</hi> and <hi>Fellow Biſhops</hi> 
                           <note n="k" place="margin">
                              <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 401. p. 128, &amp; 129.</note>. As for the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Anastaſius,</hi> S. <hi>Hierom</hi> gives him great Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums; but it muſt be obſerved, that at this time <hi>Hierom</hi> had charged <hi>Ruffinus</hi> with broaching the Hereſies of <hi>Origen</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and he being then at <hi>Bethlem,</hi> could not beat down theſe Opinions without the Popes help. And indeed, when <hi>Ruffinus</hi> came firſt to <hi>Rome</hi> he was received kindly by the laſt Pope <hi>Siricius,</hi> and <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> did not perceive any Errours in <hi>Ruffinus</hi> or <hi>Origen,</hi> till S. <hi>Hierom</hi> (upon <hi>Pammachius</hi> Information) had opened his Eyes; and at laſt, it was three years before this Pope could be made ſo ſenſible of this Hereſie, as to condemn it: So that notwithſtanding his Infallibility, if S. <hi>Hierom</hi> and his Friends had not diſcovered theſe Errours, they might in a little time have been declared for Orthodox Truths at <hi>Rome;</hi> but <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> condemning them at laſt, did wonderfully oblige S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and this was the occaſion of many of his Commendations. For this Pope are publiſhed three Decretal Epiſtles, though <hi>Baronius</hi> mentions but two, and condemns the firſt for a Forgery, and ſo doth <hi>Labbé</hi>

The matter of it is grounded on the <hi>Pontifical,</hi> which ſpeaks of a Decree made by this Pope for the Prieſts at <hi>Rome</hi> to ſtand up at the Goſpel; which the Forger of this Epiſtle turns into a general Law, and makes it be preſcribed to the <hi>Germans.</hi> The Words of it are ſtollen out of the Epiſtles of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi>

                        <p>The Notes diſpute about the fourth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> whether it were under Pope <hi>Zoſimus</hi> or <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi>

THE large and elaborate Volumes of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> are the main Guide to the Editors and Annotator: From him they take the Dates of all Councils, and out of him they have added divers new Synods not extant in the older Editions of the Councils, of which they can ſay no more, than to abbreviate <hi>Baronius:</hi> From him they borrow moſt of their plauſible Notes, by which they either paint over that which ſeems for the Intereſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> or diſparage what makes againſt it; and therefore we have had often occaſion to diſcover his Fallacies in all that part of his Annals which concerns the Councils; but there are many other notorious
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:108925:86"/>
Frauds and manifeſt Falſhoods in that Author, of which I ſhall here give ſome few Inſtances, which may ſerve as a Caution to all that read his Hiſtory, and alſo as a Direction by which they may in other Centuries find out his manifold Errours; and I ſhall confine the Examples here produced to the Fourth Century, becauſe that is the moſt largely treated of in this Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>It is evident, that all the Writers of the Roman ſide, for many Ages have deſigned to impoſe upon the World; in that, their Diſputants, their Publiſhers of Councils, and Hiſtorians do all agree; for their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Practices cannot be maintained by plain Truth. The Methods uſed by <hi>Baronius,</hi> in his Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Annals (which he writ purely to ſerve the Intereſt of the Roman Church) may be reduced to theſe Heads:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> His frequent quoting Forged and Spurious Tracts; ſuch as the <hi>Pontifical,</hi> the Acts of the Martyrs, the Eccleſiaſtical Tables (that is, the Roman <hi>Miſſal</hi> and <hi>Martyrology)</hi> with other late and fabulous Writers, ſuch as <hi>Nicephorus, Simeon, Metaphrastes, Laurentius Surius, &amp;c.</hi> And the Reader ſhall find, he very ſeldom cites any other Authors to prove the Great Actions of Primitive Popes, or the dignity of the Roman Church, and its pretended Priviledges: As alſo to make out the Miracles done by many of their Saints, and to be evidence for <hi>the Invocation of Saints, Praying for the Dead, Worſhiping the Croſs, Relicks and Images;</hi> for <hi>the Merits of Celibacy and Holineſs of Monks,</hi> or other Superſtitions. Some Examples of which in the Fourth Century are theſe: He cites the Acts of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius,</hi> which he confeſſeth need amending, to prove <hi>the Adoration of the Croſs</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 308 p. 30. §. 19.</note>; he proves the ſame by the Acts of <hi>Gregory</hi> an Armenian Biſhop, which he owns do not ſatisfie many; and by <hi>Euthymius,</hi> a late Grecian Monk, <hi>An.</hi> 1180 <note n="b" place="margin">Id. An. 311. p. 57. §. 23.</note>. Thus he aſſerts <hi>Criſpus</hi> his being Baptized with his Father <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> only by <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus,</hi> and makes out <hi>Constantine</hi>'s uſe of putting an
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:108925:86"/>
Image of Chriſt on his Coyns, only by the Acts of <hi>Damaſus,</hi> and by a Coyn which he himſelf confeſſeth had been adulterated <note n="c" place="margin">Id. An. 324. pag. 233. §. 13, &amp; 16.</note>. <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Baptiſm in <hi>Rome</hi> is alſo proved by <hi>Anastaſius Bibliothecarius,</hi> who there hath the falſe Character of an Acurate Writer <note n="d" place="margin">Ibid. p. 237. §. 30.</note>, and by the Acts of <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> which he himſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approves of in many things <note n="e" place="margin">Ibid. §. 31.</note>; and ſuſpects, that notwithſtanding all theſe fabulous Authors, his Reader will not credit the Story <note n="f" place="margin">Ibid. p. 238. §. 32.</note>. The Legend of S. <hi>Agnes</hi> and her Temple at <hi>Rome,</hi> he confeſſes, Was made by an Unknown-hand under the Name of S. <hi>Ambroſe;</hi> yet he gives a long relation of it <note n="g" place="margin">Ib. pag. 260. §. 107.</note>. So when <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who writ acurately about the Temple built over the Sepulchre by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſaith nothing of Pictures in it, he proves there was ſuch there by the ſecond <hi>Nicene</hi> Council <note n="h" place="margin">
                        <hi>Baron</hi> An. 326. pag. 353. §. 42.</note>. <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s Greek Chronicle ſaith nothing of the <hi>Invention of the Croſs,</hi> but ſome Forger hath put it into the Latin Verſion of it; therefore <hi>Baronius</hi> cites the corrupted Latin Tranſlation to prove this Legend <note n="i" place="margin">Id. ibid.</note>. The Miracles of S. <hi>Nicholas</hi> are all tranſcribed out of his Acts, which were put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Authors who lived above Five hundred years after his time, and the genuine ancient Hiſtorians mention not one of them <note n="k" place="margin">An. 326. p. 366. §. 86.</note>. <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> dedicated his new City of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to God; but <hi>Baronius</hi> chooſes to follow a later Writer of little credit, <hi>viz. Nicephorus;</hi> who ſaith (in the Phraſe of his own time) <hi>He dedicated it to the Virgin</hi> Mary <note n="l" place="margin">Ibid. An. 330. p. 396. §. 4.</note>. He makes a diſcourſe about the uſe of the Pall in the Life of Pope <hi>Mark;</hi> yet he can cite no Author, but the fabulous <hi>Pontifical,</hi> to prove it was uſed in his time <note n="m" place="margin">An. 336. p. 458 §. 63.</note>. To prove the <hi>Arian</hi> Pope <hi>Foelix</hi> was a Martyr, he cites an Inſcription pretended to be found in a Grave at <hi>Rome</hi> (where ſuch Frauds are common) about Twelve hundred years after his Death <note n="n" place="margin">An. 357. pag. 715. §. 50.</note>; ſo he makes out the Martyrdom of divers under <hi>Julian</hi> by an Oration of <hi>Nectarius</hi> (which he confeſſes is corrupted) and by <hi>Nicephorus</hi> 
                     <note n="o" place="margin">Annal. Tom. IV. An. 362. p. 21, &amp; 22.</note>: And a little after he tells long Stories of Martyrs at that time condemned by <hi>Julian</hi> at
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:108925:87"/>
                     <hi>Rome,</hi> which he proves by the Eccleſiaſtical Tables, and by the Acts of the Martyrs; yet he owns <hi>Julian</hi> was not at <hi>Rome</hi> at this time <note n="p" place="margin">Eod. An. pag. 84.</note>. Prayers at the Graves of the Saints he would eſtabliſh by a forged Book of the Lives of the Prophets, which he cites under <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>'s name <note n="q" place="margin">An. 373. pag. 309.</note>: So he would make out Prayers for the Dead, uſed in this Age, by feigned Writings, which are aſcribed to <hi>Ephraem Syrus</hi> 
                     <note n="r" place="margin">An. 378. p. 332.</note>. The Miracles aſcribed to <hi>Damaſus</hi> cannot be proved by one Author of Credit, but are ſet off with the forged Acts of <hi>Damaſus,</hi> and the modern Legends <note n="s" place="margin">An. 384. p. 427.</note>. So alſo the Miracles aſcribed to S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> are not taken generally from any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Authors, but from his ſpurious Acts <note n="t" place="margin">An. 386. pag. 468.</note>; and (to name no more) thus he proves <hi>the Adoration of the Croſs</hi> by an Homily falſly aſcribed to S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> 
                     <note n="u" place="margin">An. 397. Tom. V. p. 44.</note>: For his genuine Works do witneſs againſt this practice. And now that he did not cite theſe Authorities out of ignorance, is plain from his Confeſſion; for he ſaith of the Acts of the Martyrs, <hi>That we might better have wanted many Truths concerning them, than have had ſuch a mixture of Errours as makes the whole ſuſpected</hi> 
                     <note n="w" place="margin">
                        <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 307. §. 33. p. 24. Tom III.</note>. And again, ſpeaking of the Acts of <hi>Gallicanus, It is the manner of ſome to be aſhamed, to give a ſhort Narrative of a great Affair, and ſo according to their own Fancy they largely paraphraſe on it</hi> 
                     <note n="x" place="margin">Id. An. 330. §. 51. p. 410.</note>: And yet again in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Roman Martyrology he tells us, <hi>There was a ſad loſs of theſe Martyrs Acts in</hi> Diocletian'<hi>s time, ſo that very few of them are to be found, which may not in part be convicted of Miſtakes</hi> 
                     <note n="s" place="margin">
                        <hi>Bar.</hi> Praecap. ad Martyr. c. 3.</note>. But <hi>Melch. Canus</hi> is more ingenuous, and ſaith, Diogenes Laertius <hi>writ the Lives of the Philoſophers more honeſtly, than the Christians have writ thoſe of the Saints</hi> 
                     <note n="t" place="margin">
                        <hi>Melch.</hi> Can. Can loc. Theol. l. 11. p. 333.</note>: Yet you rarely have any better Evidence than theſe, for moſt of the Roman Doctrines and Rites. And though <hi>Nicephorus</hi> and the Modern Greeks be frequently taxed by him, <hi>for giving eaſie faith to feigned Stories,</hi> and <hi>for groſs Miſtakes</hi> 
                     <note n="u" place="margin">An. 306. §. 12. pag. 3. &amp; Tom. IV. An. 363. p. 105.</note>; yet when they tell never ſuch improbable Tales for the Roman Intereſt, then they are cited with great applauſe. Now it is a clear evidence of an ill Cauſe,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:108925:87"/>
when they can find no other Proofs but ſuch ſpurious Writings as theſe; of which practice I have here given but a few Inſtances; but the diligent Reader will obſerve this to be cuſtomary with <hi>Baronius,</hi> not only in this fourth Century, but in every part of his <hi>Annals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 2. Another Artifice is to corrupt the Words or the Senſe of genuine Authors, of which we will ſelect alſo a few Inſtances, in the ſame Century. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> barely names <hi>Peter</hi> as one whom the Pagans did Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate <note n="w" place="margin">
                        <hi>Aug.</hi> de Civ. Dei, iib. 18. c. 53.</note>; but <hi>Baronius</hi> brings this in with this Preface, <hi>That they did this, becauſe they ſaw</hi> Peter <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely magnified, eſpecially at</hi> Rome <hi>where he had fixed his Seat;</hi> and then he ſaith, <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtine <hi>records this, &amp;c.</hi> whereas this is his own Invention, to ſet off the glory of <hi>Rome</hi> 
                     <note n="x" place="margin">
                        <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 313. §. 17.</note>. So when <hi>Athanaſius</hi> is proving, that the Fathers before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council uſed the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and firſt names <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and then <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> 
                     <note n="y" place="margin">
                        <hi>Athanaſ.</hi> de decret. in <hi>Arian.</hi>
                     </note>. <hi>Baronius</hi> ſaith, He proves it eſpecially by <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the holy Roman Pope, and by <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> 
                     <note n="z" place="margin">
                        <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 325. §. 69.</note>, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Order, and putting a Note of Eminence on the Pope, contrary to the Words and Senſe of <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> Again, he cites Pope <hi>Leo</hi> (who is no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his own Cauſe); and yet <hi>Baronius</hi> would make him ſay more than he doth, even where he ſaith more than he ſhould ſay: For he cites his <hi>53d</hi> Epiſtle to ſhew, that <hi>Leo</hi> affirmed <hi>the ſixth Canon of</hi> Nice, allowed to the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> the ſecond, and to that of <hi>Antioch</hi> the third Seat, <hi>which had before been conferred on them by</hi> Rome. But the very words of <hi>Leo,</hi> cited by <hi>Baronius,</hi> ſhew this to be falſe; for <hi>Leo</hi> ſaith not, that theſe Sees had their Dignity or Order from <hi>Rome,</hi> but the former from S. <hi>Mark,</hi> the later from <hi>Peter</hi>'s firſt Preaching there <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Leon.</hi> cp. 53. ap. <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 325. §. 28.</note>. Moreover, to make his Reader fancy the Roman and the Catholic Church was all one of old, he mentions out of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius, Constantine</hi>'s writing an Epiſtle to all <hi>Romania,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:108925:88"/>
Which Name</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we ſometimes find uſed for the Catholic Church</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 319. §. 6.</note>; whereas it is manifeſt, that <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> both there and elſewhere plainly uſes <hi>Romania</hi> for the Roman Empire <note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Epiphan.</hi> contra <hi>Manich.</hi> haer. 66. &amp; contr. <hi>Arian.</hi> haer. 69.</note>; and <hi>Baronius</hi> did not find it uſed either in him, or in any other ancient Author, in any other ſenſe. That Period in <hi>Optatus,</hi> which <hi>Baronius</hi> cites with great applauſe (if it be not added by ſome ignorant Zealot of the Roman ſide) is a ſcandal to the Learning of that Father, for he derives the <hi>Syriac</hi> word, <hi>Cephas,</hi> from the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and by that ridiculous Etymology would draw as contemptible a conſequence, <hi>viz. That</hi> Peter <hi>was Head of the Apoſtles;</hi> and again he ſeems wilfully to pervert the Precept of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. XII. 13. <hi>Diſtributing to the neceſſities of the Saints;</hi> which in <hi>Optatus</hi>'s Reading is, <hi>Communicating with the Memories of the Saints;</hi> that is, (as he applies it) <hi>with</hi> Rome, <hi>where there are the Memorials of two of the Apoſtles.</hi> I could wiſh for <hi>Optatus</hi>'s Credit that theſe weak Paſſages were ſpurious, or buried in ſilence; and the Learned <hi>Baldwin</hi> is aſhamed of this groſs Errour <note n="d" place="margin">Opt. <hi>Milev.</hi> lib. 2. pag. 48. <hi>Baldvin.</hi> notis, pag. 184.</note>: But <hi>Baronius</hi> thinks, though they make for the diſhonour of the Father, they tend to the Credit of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo he cites them in great pomp, and puts them in a whole Line to make them look more plauſible,—<hi>the Head of the Apoſtles, whence he was called</hi> Cephas (ſo <hi>Optatus:</hi> But <hi>Binius</hi> adds) <hi>deducing the Interpretation from the Greek Word, for in Syriac it ſignifies an</hi> hard Stone <note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 321. §. 5.</note>; and then glories extremely, as if <hi>Optatus</hi> had made Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with <hi>Rome</hi> the ſole Note of a Catholic. Whereas in the next Page but one, <hi>Optatus</hi> goes on,—<hi>You cannot prove you have any Communion with the Seven Churches of</hi> Aſia,—<hi>and yet if you be out of the Communion of thoſe Churches, you are to be accounted Aliens.</hi> Which Paſſage <hi>Baronius</hi> very fraudulently leaves out <note n="f" place="margin">Opt. <hi>Milev.</hi> lib. 2. pag. 50.</note>, becauſe it ſhews a true Catholic muſt not only be in Communion with <hi>Rome,</hi> but alſo with all other Orthodox Churches,</p>

                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:108925:88"/>
To proceed, Even in ſpurious Authors he uſeth this Artifice; for that Forged Book of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Munificence only ſaith, <hi>He placed a piece of the Croſs, in a Church which he had built:</hi> But <hi>Baronius</hi> relates it <hi>That he placed it there with most Religious Worſhip</hi>

                        <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 324. §. 105.</note>; and a little after he perceiving that Fabulous Author had ſuppoſed <hi>Conſtantine</hi> buried his Mother long before ſhe died, puts in of his own head, <hi>But this (i. e.</hi> the putting his Mother in a Porphyry Coffin) <hi>was done afterward</hi> 
                     <note n="h" place="margin">Id. ib. §. 114.</note>. Speaking of the Biſhops returning home from the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>They took with them the Rule of Faith, confirmed by the Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>to be communicated to their People, and to abſent Biſhops:</hi> But no Hiſtorian, Ancient or Authentic, mentions any preceding Confirmation of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed by the Pope, who was one of the abſent Biſhops, to whom it was to be communicated; wherefore thoſe words, <hi>Of its being confirmed by the Pope,</hi> are invented and added to the ſtory by <hi>Baronius</hi> 
                     <note n="i" place="margin">
                        <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 325. §. 197.</note>. He obſerves, <hi>That</hi> Conſtantine <hi>confeſſes, he was not fit to judge in the Caſe of</hi> Athanaſius, <hi>becauſe Eccleſiaſtical Matters were to be judged among the Clergy:</hi> Which he proves by <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Letter there recited; but <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi>'s Letter is not directed to the Clergy, but <hi>To the People of the Catholic Church at</hi> Alexandria: And his Words are to the People who lived on the Place, and knew the Matters of Fact; and therefore he ſaith to them, <hi>It is proper for you, and not for me to judge of that Affair</hi>

                        <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 329. §. 7, 8.</note>; ſo that <hi>Baronius</hi> forceth his own Senſe upon the Emperour. And when <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſpeaketh of—<hi>time for Repentance according to the Canons of the Church,</hi> he adds,—<hi>that is, for Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</hi> Which Popiſh Satisfaction he would alſo prove out of a Canon at <hi>Antioch,</hi> which only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions confeſſing the Fault, and bringing forth fruits meet for Repentance <note n="l" place="margin">An. 341. §. 43, &amp; 44.</note>. When <hi>Socrates</hi> only ſaith, Euſebius <hi>of</hi> Nicomedia'<hi>s Letters were received by</hi> Julius <hi>after his death; Baronius</hi> thus enlarges it, Euſebius, <hi>who had fled from the Judgment of the Roman Church was

Which Note is forced upon this place, for here <hi>Rome</hi> is named in the ſame Sentence with the Church and the Biſhop, and ſo it muſt be underſtood of the Pope; but without any advantage to him more than it would have been to the Biſhop of <hi>Eugubium,</hi> to ſay, <hi>I went to</hi> Eugubium <hi>and viſited the Church and the Biſhop.</hi> Again, S. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith expreſly, that Acacius <hi>ſubſtituted</hi> Foelix <hi>an</hi> Arian <hi>to be Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>in</hi> Liberius <hi>his ſtead.</hi> Here <hi>Baronius</hi> pretends ſome Copies leave out the word <hi>Arian,</hi> and ſo he reads it, <hi>Substituted</hi> Foelix <hi>to be Biſhop of</hi> Rome <note n="o" place="margin">An. 355. §. 51.</note>; and becauſe ſome ſuch Paraſites of <hi>Rome</hi> as himſelf, who would not endure that ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Truth of a Pope's being an Heretic, had left out this word, He boldly aſſerts it for the true Reading; whereas not only <hi>Socrates</hi> expreſly ſaith, <hi>He was an</hi> Arian <hi>in Opinion;</hi> but <hi>Hierom</hi> himſelf in his Chronicle affirms, that <hi>Foelix</hi> was put in by the <hi>Arians;</hi> and it is not like they would have put him in, if he had not been of their party.

Another Artifice of our <hi>Annalist</hi> is, firſt to ſuppoſe things which make for the honour of his Church, without any manner of proof, and then to take his own Suppoſitions for grounds of Argument.

Again, He ſuppoſos without any proof, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> knew the Supreme Power over all Chriſtians, was in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> 
                     <note n="i" place="margin">Eod.

Thus he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himſelf by following thoſe Lying Acts of <hi>Syl veſter,</hi> in order to ſupport the falſe Story of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s being Baptized at <hi>Rome.</hi> Soon after, out of a Fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Author he talks very big of the low Reverence which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> paid to the Biſhops at the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council <note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 325. §. 16.</note>; whereas all the Authentic Hiſtorians ſay, The Biſhops roſe up when he entred in, and paid him a great reſpect <note n="c" place="margin">Idem ibid. §. 52.</note>. And when he hath told many incredible Legends about the Nails of the Croſs, and-ſeems to grant that divers falſe Nails have been adored for the true, he excuſes his abuſed Catholics for their miſtaken Worſhip of falſe Relics, ſaying, <hi>That their Faith excuſes their Fault</hi>

                        <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 328 §. 20, &amp; 21.</note>; yea, in the year 340 he ſaith, Athanaſius <hi>firſt brought the Inſtitution of Monks to</hi> Rome <note n="f" place="margin">Id. An. 340. §. 8.</note>, which is a manifeſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
                  <p>To proceed, I wonder with what Face he could commend <hi>Athanaſius</hi> for ſpeaking charitably of the Heretic <hi>Arius,</hi> after he was dead, when he reviles <hi>Euſebius</hi> after his death <note n="g" place="margin">

He largely relates many Appeals to the Emperour in the caſe of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and yet when at laſt the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was choſen Arbitrator in this Caſe, and this but once, He cries out, <hi>Behold, Reader, the ancient Custom! &amp;c.</hi> Whereas ſince the Emperours were

§. 6. We may alſo obſerve, that for the ſame ends He makes innumerable falſe Inferences on purpoſe to pervert the Truth; thus from S. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s calling <hi>Melchiades, A Father of Chriſtian People,</hi> (as every Biſhop is) <hi>Baronius</hi> concludes, that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> was for the Popes Supremacy <note n="q" place="margin">Baron. <hi>An.</hi> 313. §. 29.</note>: So from Biſhops judging in Cauſes where the People referred their Differences to them, he frequently infers, <hi>A right in Biſhops, to judge in Temporal Matters</hi>

Again, That the Pope was not beholding to the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> for his Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, which he had from Chriſt, he proves by Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> his Teſtimony, who had the impudence in his own Cauſe and for his own Ends, to tell this Story Five hundred years after <note n="t" place="margin">Id. ib. §. 130.</note>: So he condemns the <hi>Arians,</hi> for ejecting Biſhops without ſtaying for the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Sentence, which he proves was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt by an Epiſtle of Pope <hi>Julius,</hi> which ſays, <hi>The</hi> Arians <hi>ſhould firſt have writ to all Biſhops, that ſo what was right might be determined by all</hi>

                     <note n="d" place="margin">Idem An. 385. pag 435.</note>. From which Inſtances it doth appear, that our Annaliſt did not, like an Hiſtorian, endeavour to declare Truth, but only to ſerve an Intereſt and a Party.</p>
                  <p>§. 7. Laſtly, His Partiality notoriouſly appears where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is any way concerned; for when any thing of this kind comes in his way, he puts off the Character of an Hiſtorian and turns Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant, labouring to confute the moſt ancient and authentic Authors, if they ſeem to ſay any thing againſt that Church. Thus we may obſerve what tedious digreſſions he makes about the Primacy of <hi>Rome</hi> in his diſcourſe on the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, for which he twice makes Apologies <note n="e" place="margin">Baron. <hi>An.</hi> 325. §. 136, &amp; 140.</note>.

                        <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 362. pag. 18.</note>. In like manner, He makes a long excurſion to diſprove an Authentic Story of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> tearing a Veil with

a Picture wrought in it, becauſe ſuch things were not fit to be in Churches <note n="g" place="margin">Baron. <hi>An. 392. p.</hi> 568.</note>; and he ſcarce ever meets with any of the Roman Corruptions, mentioned in the moſt fabulous Authors, but he leaves the Hiſtory, and enlarges into Remarks upon thoſe Paſſages. But if the Writer be never ſo eminent, that touches any of theſe Sores, his buſineſs always is, to baf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>le the Evidence; of which there is ſcarce one year in his Annals, wherein there are not ſome Examples. On the other ſide, He takes every ſlight occaſion to make the moſt ſpiteful Reflexions on all that he counts Enemies to the Roman Church: Thus he applies the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi>'s deſcription of the <hi>Arians</hi> to the Reformed Churches, though it agree much better with theſe of his own Religion <note n="h" place="margin">Baron. <hi>An.</hi> 318. §. 80.</note>. Again, He reviles us, becauſe we do not honour the Modern idle lewd Monks of their Communion, as much as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients did thoſe holy and devout Monks, which were in the Primitive Times, though it be plain to all the World, theſe are like them in nothing but the Name <note n="i" place="margin">
                        <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 340. §. 10. item An. 363. p. 132.</note>. The like Outcry he makes upon Proteſtants, for undeceiving ſome of thoſe ſilly Nuns, who have been decoyed into unlawful Vows, meerly for Intereſt and Secular Ends; and affirms the perſwading theſe to Marry, is worſe than the <hi>Arian</hi>'s raviſhing and murthering them at <hi>Alexandria</hi> 
                     <note n="k" place="margin">Baron. <hi>An.</hi> 326. §. 29.</note>. Thus alſo he compares the Reformed Divines to the <hi>Eunomians,</hi> who taught, <hi>Their Faith alone would ſave them, though their Lives were never ſo wicked</hi> 
                     <note n="l" place="margin">Baron. <hi>An.</hi> 360. §. 38.</note>; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting that their Prieſt's convert (as they call it) Murderers at the Gallows, by teaching them this very Principle. And, to name no more Examples, when S. <hi>Baſil</hi> inveighs againſt thoſe who deſpiſed the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cuſtoms of the Primitive Church, He ſpitefully applies this to the Reformed <note n="m" place="margin">
                        <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 363. pag. 131.</note>. Whereas in very Truth, they of <hi>Rome</hi> have left off more Ancient Rites, and brought in more new ones, than any ſort of Chriſtians in the World. By theſe and many more Inſtances which might be given, even out of this
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:108925:94"/>
one Century, it is evident, that the whole deſign of his Hiſtory is to make all the Doctrins and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of <hi>Rome</hi> ſeem to be Primitive and right, and that he cares not how unlawful the Means be which he uſes, to gain this belief in his Reader.</p>
                  <p>§. Yet to conclude, we will obſerve, That after all his evil-Methods there are many things which he could neither avoid relating, nor yet excuſe, which condemn the Modern Roman Church. I wonder how he could Commend <hi>Conſtantine</hi> for aboliſhing the Stews, and the proſtituting of Chriſtian Women there; and not obſerve, That the Pope now tolerates theſe Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf <note n="n" place="margin">Baren <hi>An.</hi> 314. §. 74.</note>. Again, how doth it agree with the INFALLIBILITY of the Pope, to ſay, <hi>That one Holy Spirit governs the Catholic Church, ſo as to make the Biſhops of all Ages and Places agree in the ſame Opinion</hi> 
                     <note n="o" place="margin">Id. Ib. §. 76.</note>? If this be ſo, what need one Biſhop alone be made Infallible? And if it be (as he ſaith) a Doctrin taught by the Apoſtles, and conſequently true, <hi>That the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father;</hi> then the Pope, who condemns this as an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie of the Greeks, is not Infallible <note n="p" place="margin">Baron. <hi>An.</hi> 325. §. 70.</note>. If <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> had known of this <hi>Infallibility</hi> lodged at <hi>Rome,</hi> he would have ſent thither for exact Copies of the Holy Scriptures, and not to <hi>Euſebius</hi> in <hi>Paleſtina</hi> 
                     <note n="q" place="margin">Baron. <hi>An.</hi> 330. §. 23.</note>. If <hi>Damaſus</hi> had this Infallible Spirit, how came he (after he was Pope) to need to be inſtructed in the meaning of Scripture by S. <hi>Hierom</hi>

                        <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 361. §. 35, ad §. 39.</note>. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> made a Law to baniſh Monks from Cities, and oblige them to retire into Deſert places <note n="m" place="margin">
                        <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 390. pag. 537.</note>: But the Modern Monks are all for Noble Seats in the beſt freqnented Cities; ſo that theſe and thoſe are vaſtly different. Finally, He makes the Perſecuting Spirit of <hi>Macedonius,</hi> and the Patience of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> a mark to diſtinguiſh Truth from Hereſie: Now, if we apply this Mark; as none are greater Perſecutors than the Romaniſts, ſo we muſt conclude none are further from the Truth <note n="n" place="margin">

And now by theſe few Inſtances, within the compaſs of one Century, the Reader may judge what Truth there can be in that Religion, that needs ſo many Frauds to hide its Faults; and what truſt can be given to that Hiſtorian, who to ſerve an ill Cauſe, makes no ſcruple to uſe all theſe kinds of Deceit. This may warn all that deſign to peruſe theſe <hi>Annals,</hi> not to rely upon any of his Authorities or Arguments without examining, and alſo not to take every thing for Primitive and Ancient, which he pretends to be ſo. This may ſuffice for this Volume, and (if we proceed) we ſhall make the like Remarks on the following Tomes; to ſhew, that their Religion is made up of Falſhoods, and cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended without Lying and Forgery, which is the great ſupport of their Evil Cauſe.</p>

                  <p>WHen I formerly had the Honour of Your Acquaintance, tho' at a diſtance, I reckon'd it none of my leaſt Felicities: But ſince
<pb facs="tcp:108925:99"/>
that happy Providence that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered theſe Nations, brought Your Grace nearer, to Illuſtrate theſe Northern Regions with Your excellent Doctrine, and warm them with Your pious Example; I could not better expreſs my extraordinary Satisfaction and my Duty both, than by preſenting theſe Papers to Your Grace, who have ſuffered ſo much from the Romiſh Party, and done ſo much to prevent their once growing and dangerous Errors.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Collections were all made, when this Church was threatned to have their Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons impoſed on us; and the Firſt Part was ready for the Preſs while that Cloud hung over our Heads. This Second Part hath been hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

Frauds and Forgeries are naturally Your Averſation, and therefore the diſcovery of ſo great a heap of them, may I hope be acceptable to Your Grace; not on your own Account, to whom probably here is nothing New; but becauſe this Eſſay may aſſiſt young Divines and ſuch as begin to read Church-Hiſtory, at a cheap and eaſy rate to diſtinguiſh Truth from Falſhood in matters of great importance. I ſhall add no more,

ſince to give your Grace your juſt Character, is as needleſs as it would be difficult for me, and would not be pleaſing to your Grace; only I ſhall moſt heartily pray, <hi>That the Church may be long happy in Your Conduct, and that he may be reckoned among Your Grace's Friends,</hi> who is,</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>ANTIQUITY</hi> ſeems ſo Naturally to challenge Veneration from all ſucceeding Times, that it gives a Value to many things which have nothing elſe to recommend them: But the Records of former Ages, eſpecially thoſe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Faith and Practice of the Church, while it was in its purity and ſplendor, are by all ſober Men accounted truly Sacred. Yet no Writings have ſuffered more by fraudulent Hands than theſe: For moſt of them being for many Ages in the cuſtody of thoſe, who had a new Authority to ſet up, and were to contrive new Doctrines to furniſh and ſupport it with Wealth and Power, their Intereſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged them to corrupt all genuine Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hiſtory, and to invent innumerable ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb facs="tcp:108925:101"/>
Pieces, under great and ancient Names, thereby to impoſe upon the ignorant Ages, and make them imagine, their later Devices were of Apoſtolical, or at leaſt Primitive Original: And this is done with ſo much Artifice and Cunning, that a careleſs Reader of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſtaſtical Story (as they repreſent it) is in danger of being perſuaded, That the Modern Roman Church is in all things conformable to the Primitive, from which it differs as much as Darkneſs doth from Light: To prevent which fatal Miſtake, I think no Time can be better ſpent, no Pains more uſefully employed, than in correcting the Hiſtory of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, and diſcovering the various Falſifications thereof.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I have now purſued and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged my Deſign of remarking the Roman Frauds and Forgeries in their Editions of the Councils, and in <hi>Baronius,</hi> by rectifying the Hiſtory of the Church, and all Paſſages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to it, as I go along; having proceeded as far as the Middle of the Sixth Century: A Period which contains Three of the firſt Five General Councils, and is memorable for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of moſt important Tranſactions. It was in this time that the moſt refined Hereticks
<pb facs="tcp:108925:101"/>
diſturbed the Church, and the barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions broke into the Roman Empire, and ſetled in divers parts of it. And while the former employed the Pens of the Learned, and the later diverted the Thoughts of the declining Emperors, <hi>Rome</hi> had an unlucky Opportunity to ſerve the ends of her aſpiring Ambition, and to lay the Foundation of her future Grandeur: Which Projects were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by a great decay, not only of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but of Piety and good Manners, toward the End of this time, which made way for divers Superſtitions to creep into the Worſhip, and many Irregularities to grow up in the Diſcipline of the Chriſtian Church. Yet ſtill there were many Learned and pious Writers, who laboured to defend the Faith, to check all ſorts of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations, and to keep up the Primitive Purity and good Order: So that the Editors of theſe Councils and <hi>Baronius</hi> have been put to all their ſhifts, to feign an Agreement between the Records of this Period, and the Modern Doctrines and Practices of their Church, foiſting in many Legends and ſpurious Tracts, and corrupting the Words, as well as forcing the Senſe of the genuine Writings of theſe Ages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:108925:102"/>
Of which Proceedings I was in hopes to have found, both an exact Account and a juſt Cenſure in the lately publiſhed Work of the Learned Monſieur. <hi>Du Pin</hi>

And it muſt be confeſſed he hath owned more of theſe ill Practices, than any Writer of that Church, and ſuffered for telling more Truth than the Roman Cauſe can bear. Yet after all, either by the prejudices of his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or the influence of his Superiors, and the diſadvantage of his Circumſtances, many things of this kind are omitted, which are neceſſary for us to know: And though I would adviſe Young Students of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Antiquity (whoſe ſervice I aim at) to Read thoſe Elaborate Collections; Yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſſure them, they may every where depend on them.</p>
                  <p>The beſt method to know the wole Truth, is to Read over the Councils themſelves, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them, as they go on, with <hi>Baronius</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and both with theſe brief Remarks; which will ſo unfold that Myſtery of <hi>Rome</hi>'s cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting and falſifying the Church-Hiſtory and Writings of theſe times, that a diligent obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will hereby be enabled (without a Guide) to diſcover more of theſe Errors, than our
<pb facs="tcp:108925:102"/>
deſigned brevity would allow us to ſet down: And ſuch a Reader may not only ſafely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe the Hiſtorians and Diſputants of that ſide, but will ſoon arrive at the Skill to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute all their Arguments, which are ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by diſguiſing of Ancient Records: And as his diſcovery of the Roman Frauds, will give him a juſt averſation for that Church; ſo his ſeeing that our Church rejects theſe Arts of deceiving, and needs no falſe or feigned E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, muſt give him as true a value for it; ſince we appeal to all uncorrupted Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, Our Paſtors can ſay with S. Peter, <hi>We have not followed cunningly devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Fables</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">2 Peter I. 16.</note>. Deceit in Human Affairs, is equally Odious and Miſchievous: But in Religious Matters it is highly Impious and Intollerable; becauſe it not only miſleads Men in matters relating to their Eternal Salvation: But (as a Learned Prince uſed to ſay,) <hi>it makes God himſelf an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Crime, and a Party to the holy Cheat</hi> 
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Dum homines decipunt, Deum ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponunt tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ſceleris mediatorem: Rex Alfonſ. apud Phil.

<pb facs="tcp:108925:103"/>
it is diſcovered; wherefore I hope theſe Papers, which ſo plainly expoſe this ſort of Falſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may ſet the Hiſtory of theſe Times in a clearer Light; and not only help to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive ſome well meaning and miſled Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts, but to Eſtabliſh the Inquiſitive and Ingenious Members of this rightly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church, for whoſe Safety and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity the Author daily Prays, and to whoſe Service he Dedicates all his Labours.</p>

§. 2. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> who had the <note place="margin">An.

                              <hi>Zoſim.</hi> hiſt. lib. 5. pag. 816.</note>. The other is, That when <hi>Rome</hi> was taken afterwards by <hi>Alarious,</hi> Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> was gone out of the City to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna,</hi> and did not return till all was quiet; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot with <hi>Baronius</hi> think that St. <hi>Hierom</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet <note n="t" place="margin">Baron.

                        <p>The third Epiſtle to <hi>Exuperius</hi> is liable to all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt the former: <hi>Labbè</hi> ſaith <hi>it is patch'd up out of</hi> Siricius <hi>Epiſtle to</hi> Himerius, <hi>the ſecond Epiſtle of</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine, <hi>and one of</hi> Leo <hi>to</hi> Theodorus <note n="o" place="margin">

Before I leave this matter I muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that <hi>Baronius</hi> his great deſign was to repreſent Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> as the chief, yea and almoſt ſole Inſtrument in vindicating the injuries done to St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and therefore he tells us, <hi>That</hi> Innocent <hi>would not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the Biſhops of the</hi> Eaſt, <hi>unleſs they would put his name into the Tables;</hi> and he cites <hi>Theodores</hi> to prove this; but <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s very words are, <hi>That the weſtern Biſhops would not communicate with them, but on that condition</hi>

So when the Adverſaries of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> (hearing that complaints of their proceedings were made among others to the Pope) ſent ſome to give an account of what they had done, <hi>Baronius</hi> (without any proof) dreams of a ſentence paſſed by <hi>Innocent</hi> to null what

they had done <note n="i" place="margin">Idem.

wherein they proceeded to deprive an Eminent Patriarch without the knowledge or conſent of the Pope; and had not the Articles been falſe and the Sentence unjuſt, it had never been revoked barely for wanting <hi>Innocent</hi>'s approbation <note n="u" place="margin">

Secondly, The Notes on the Firſt African Council tell us of Legates <hi>ſent to the Pope for obtaining ſome indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to the Donatiſts; which Legates being returned, they related in this Council, what they had obtained from</hi> Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſius <note n="y" place="margin">

Now this would make any one, who doth not conſult the Acts themſelves (printed on purpoſe in Pages far off) to think, the Pope was ſolely concerned in this matter, which is an invention of <hi>Baronius</hi>

But if we look back into the former Council, we ſhall find theſe African Legates were ſent in general <hi>to the parts beyond the Seas, and to</hi> Venerius <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Milan <hi>as well as to</hi> Anaſtaſius <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Rome <note n="a" place="margin">

Now the African Fathers applying to all theſe Biſhops as well as to the Pope, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares they did not look on him as ſufficient alone to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine their Matters: Beſides, they did not ſend to theſe Weſtern Biſhops <hi>to obtain indulgence</hi> (as the Notes out of <hi>Baronius</hi> falſly pretend); For they had decreed before to indulge them, only deſired the Weſtern Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops for the more credit, to give their Suffrages to this Fact; for ſo it would appear not to be only their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Opinion.

as may be ſeen by the Acts; and after the meſſage from the Italian Biſhops, added to their own Authority, would not work on the obſtinacy of the Donatiſts, they decree to ſend Legates to the Emperor <hi>Honorius</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to ſuppreſs them, ordering theſe Legates to carry Letters of Communion to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other Biſhops of thoſe parts, and to receive other Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Communion from them in <hi>Italy</hi> to teſtifie they <note place="margin">An.

The Sum of it is, they tell their honourable Brother, that hearing he was in <hi>Zoſimus</hi> place, they had writ to him about <hi>Apiarius,</hi> who had now confeſſed his Faults be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and begged pardon, and was removed from officiating in his old Church, but allowed to keep his Degree.

This is the true, though brief account of this Famous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, wherein the Roman Church was diſcovered to aim at Superiority, and a uſurped Juriſdiction, and to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it to the prejudice of the Faith, and the Rights of other Churches. Moreover, it was here diſcovered, that <hi>Rome,</hi> to cover this injuſtice and irregularity, had corrupted the Canons of the moſt famous of all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, and cited ſuch Canons out of it, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were made there.

Sees: But then he pretends the African Biſhops did not (as we do) charge <hi>Zoſimus</hi> with fraud and forgery. I anſwer, that how modeſtly ſoever they might ſpeak of this Fact, it really was a notorius Impoſture, and it was ſufficient that they proved it to be ſo, and writ plainly to both <hi>Boniface</hi> and <hi>Celeſtine</hi> (as the Letters yet extant ſhew) that they would never endure that uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Power any more, which the Popes by virtue of theſe feigned Canons had exerciſed: And if rejecting Appeals to <hi>Rome</hi> be making a Schiſm, 'tis certain the Africans did not ſuffer them ſo long as the face of a Church remained there; ſo that probably that Epiſtle of <hi>Boniface</hi> the ſecond, writ to <hi>Eulalius</hi> near an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after, may be true, and had not been cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binius,</hi> but only becauſe it ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a Church might have Martyrs in it and be a true Church, though it utterly diſowned all ſubordination to <hi>Rome:</hi> And I am ſure they juſtifie many Epiſtles that are leſs probable, if they make for the intereſt of the Pope. Againſt this, <hi>Baronius</hi> and the Notes Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that there was an Appeal made by an African Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Fuſſala,</hi> who for notorious Crimes was put out of his See by St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and others; and it ſeems <hi>Boniface</hi> and <hi>Celeſtine</hi> both allowed this Appeal, and heard his Cauſe; and this, theſe Flatterers of <hi>Rome</hi> think hapned at this time by the Providence of God <note n="m" place="margin">

But let it be conſidered, that for ſo notorious a Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal as this Biſhop to appeal at this time, is neither any credit to the Pope, nor any proof that there were no African Canons at this time to prohibit it; for it is likely enough, that an ill Man, who had no means to ſhelter himſelf from the Juſtice of his own Country, but by appealing to thoſe Popes, who at that time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a Right to receive ſuch Complaints, would uſe that means of Appeal, even though it were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Africa.</hi> So that his appealing doth not prove it was lawful, nor that it was not forbid there: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, though St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writ modeſtly, yet he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates no more, but that ſome ſuch Sentences as he

had paſſed on this Biſhop of <hi>Fuſſala,</hi> had been paſſed or approved by the Popes; which only prove in Fact, that ſome African Biſhops had before this time appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but he doth not ſay it was right; yea, we ſee the Councils, in which he was preſent, condemning it as an uſurpation and great injuſtice, <hi>ex malis moribus bonae Leges.</hi> The thing had been practiſed till the Popes foſtering Hereticks, and lewd convicted Criminals opened the Eyes of the African Church, and made them prohibit them, and claim their antient Rights. Again, upon St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Letter it appears, the Pope did not proceed to reſtore this Biſhop; and it ſeems when former Popes had taken upon them to reſtore ejected Biſhops, they were forced to do it by ſtrong hand, even by ſending Clerks with Soldiers to execute the Sentence, which ſhews their Authority was not ſubmitted to in <hi>Africa:</hi> And the Biſhops in their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Celestin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The next Note <hi>(l)</hi> gravely tells us, that the words <hi>Sardican Council,</hi> were falſly put into the Text of this Council, becauſe the Legates profeſſed theſe Canons were made at <hi>Nice,</hi> and becauſe the African Fathers ſay they knew of no Sardican Council, which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of the Popes ſending Legates, &amp;c. <note n="r" place="margin">Not. in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. 6.

But we may note here very juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That theſe Popes were ſtrangely inſolent to cite two Canons of a poor obſcure Council, never heard of in <hi>Africa,</hi> no not by the learned S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> (as the Notes confeſs,) and daringly fix theſe Canons upon the moſt famous general Council that ever was, eſpecially ſince the Nicene Council doth expreſly charge <note n="s" place="margin">Concil. <hi>Nicen.</hi> can. 5. vid. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 725.</note>, That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Biſhops ſentence ſhall ſtand good in his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; ſo that he who is Excommunicated by ſome ſhall not be received by others. Now the pretended Canon allows the Pope to receive any perſon Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by the Biſhops of his own Province: So that it expreſly contradicts the Canons of the Nicene Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; and yet the Popes confidently ſaid it was made there: Had the African Fathers believed them and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, no doubt theſe two Canons, and perhaps all the reſt of that petty Synod had been impoſed upon the World for genuin Canons of the Nicene Council, by the Roman Church, whoſe Emiſſaries have forged no leſs than 60 new Canons, and publiſhed them under the name of that famous Council. Before I leave this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I muſt note, that <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> who here confeſs theſe two Canons were made at <hi>Sardica,</hi> do in the Notes on the Nicene Council, impudently cite them, to prove there were more than twenty Canons made at <hi>Nice,</hi> of which number they ſay were the Canons about Appeals, produced in the ſixth Council of <hi>Carthage</hi>

                        <p>Here alſo the Editors print at large the two famous Epiſtles of the African Biſhops, to two Popes ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, <hi>Boniface</hi> and <hi>Celeſtine,</hi> wherein they do utterly condemn Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> and diſcover the forgery of thoſe pretended Nicene Canons, by which their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates attempted to juſtifie them. I have given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the former of theſe Letters in the Life of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface.</hi> And I ſhall add here, that the latter Epiſtle to their honourable Brother <hi>Celeſtine</hi> (writ ſome years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) ſhews the Africans continued ſtill in the ſame mind <note n="s" place="margin">
                              <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 757. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 1674.</note>; for therein they acquaint him that they had called a Council; <hi>and though</hi> Apiarius <hi>alledged the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Roman Church which had received him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully to Communion, they examined his Cauſe, and at laſt he confeſſed his notorious Crimes: Wherefore they ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire the Pope not ſo eaſily to receive Complaints from thence, nor admit thoſe to his Communion whom they had excommunicated; for they ſhew that the Nicene Council forbids this, both as to Biſhops, Presbyters and Lay-men, without any derogation to the priviledge of the African Church, committing all the Clergy to their own Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and wiſely ordering every buſineſs to be determined in that Province where it aroſe, knowing that the Spirit of God would not be wanting to any Country, where a Council of Biſhops ſhould meet; ſo that none need fear to be injured,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108925:127"/>
ſince they might appeal to a greater Council of their own Province, or to a Univerſal Synod: Whereas if Judgment were to be given beyond the Seas, many Witneſſes muſt be wanting, and many other things muſt hinder the finding out of truth.</hi> They add,<hi>—That they could not find any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil which allowed his Holineſs to ſend any Legates to hear Cauſes; and for thoſe Canons which</hi> Fauſtinus <hi>had produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as made at</hi> Nice, <hi>they could find no ſuch Canons in the Authentick Copies of that Council. Finally, They bid him not ſend any of his Clerks to execute his Sentence, to which if they ſhould ſubmit, they ſhould ſeem to bring the vanity of Secular Arrogance into God's Church.</hi> This is the Sum of this excellent Letter, which diſowns and condemns all Appeals, and renounces the Popes juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over <hi>Africa,</hi> with a modeſt intimation, that his claim was grounded upon a notorious Forgery, and therefore he is required to pretend to it no longer, for that they will not ſubmit to ſuch an Uſurpation. Yet ſuch is the Impudence of the Roman Editors, that in a Marginal Note upon this Epiſtle <note n="t" place="margin">
                              <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 757. col. 2. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 1675.</note>, they ſay theſe African Biſhops deſire the Pope, <hi>to appoint another way of proſecuting Appeals:</hi> Which is a groſs contradicting the Text it ſelf, wherein all manner of Appeals, and all ways of proſecuting them are utterly condemned; but this was too harſh, and therefore the Truth was to be daubed over with this plauſible Fiction.</p>
                        <p>After this <hi>Binius</hi> preſents us with another Edition of theſe African Canons and Epiſtles, in Latin and Greek <note n="u" place="margin">

                           <note place="margin">An.

Virgin to be the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God, holding that the Perſon which was born of her, was no more than a Meer Man: Which Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not only made a Faction at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but cauſed Diviſions among the Egyptian Monks; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon St. <hi>Cyril</hi> firſt writ a Confutation of them to thoſe Monks, and then with great modeſty admoniſhed <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius</hi> of theſe Errors, by divers Letters; but he deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Admonition, juſtified the Doctrines, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted thoſe who would not own them, being ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Intereſt in the Imperial Court. Upon this, <hi>Cyril</hi> called in Pope <hi>Celeſtine</hi> to his aſſiſtance, ſending him an account of what he had writ to <hi>Neſtorius:</hi> On the other ſide, <hi>Neſtorius</hi> alſo writ to <hi>Celeſtrine,</hi> and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:108925:128"/>
ſent his Sermons in which theſe Doctrines were contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for him to peruſe. The Pope by the advice of ſuch Weſtern Biſhops as he could then get together, takes the part of <hi>Cyril,</hi> and offered him to join with him in condemning <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> if he did not recant: But the Authority of theſe two Patriarchs of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> not ſufficing to condemn a Patriarch of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> it was thought fit to deſire the Emperor to call a General Council at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where <hi>Nestorius</hi> might appear, and his Opinions be examined; and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror at length did agree to this Requeſt.

                        <p>As to the firſt, the Hiſtorical Preface, before this Council, labours to perſuade us, That <hi>Celeſtine</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Council to be called <note n="a" place="margin">

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:108925:128"/>
Council: So that it ſeems <hi>Celeſtine,</hi> at firſt, had no mind ſuch a Council ſhould be called, nor <hi>Cyril</hi> neither; but when they ſaw their Authority was inſufficient, then <hi>Cyril</hi> put the Monks of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> upon petitioning the Emperor <hi>to command a General Council to meet very ſpeedily</hi> (as their words are) <note n="e" place="margin">
                              <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 162. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 429.</note>; and the ſame <hi>Cyril</hi> put <hi>Juvenalis,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> upon writing to the Emperor for the ſame purpoſe <note n="f" place="margin">

Now why ſhould not theſe Applications have been made to the Pope, if the Council were to be called by his Authority? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if <hi>Celeſtine</hi> had called it, his Letter of Summons would appear; but though none ever ſaw that, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Edict is yet extant, wherein he fixes the day and place for the Council to meet, enjoyns <hi>Cyril,</hi> with the Biſhops of his Province, to be there at that time, and tells him he had writ to all other Metropolitans (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably to <hi>Celeſtine</hi> among the reſt) to attend the Synod, and not to meddle with this Matter, till the meeting of this General Aſſembly, from which whoever abſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, ſhould not be excuſed <note n="g" place="margin">

                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We ſhall next examine into the proceedings of this Council, and ſee where the Editors have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicated therein for the intereſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> as alſo what elſe therein is pertinent to our purpoſe. Now theſe are, Firſt thoſe things which hapned before; and, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly in the Council. Firſt, Before the Council in <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Letter to <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> he tells him, that <hi>Celeſtine</hi> and the Biſhops aſſembled at <hi>Rome,</hi> had adviſed him to enquire whether thoſe Papers were writ by <hi>Neſtorius</hi> or no <note n="f" place="margin">

This they all falſly tranſlate, <hi>Celeſtino ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benté, &amp;c.</hi> as if the Pope had a Power <hi>to command</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril; whereas the Original Word imports no more than an intimation given him to make this enquiry; and that not by the Pope alone, but by the whole Roman Synod. Again, ſince this Controverſie began between two Patriarchs, <hi>Cyril</hi> was ſo modeſt, that he would not by his own ſingle Authority Anathematize <hi>Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> till he had acquainted the Biſhops both of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>West</hi> with it; yet he declares he had power to have done this if he pleaſed <note n="g" place="margin">

Now his forbearing to do this out of Prudence and Humility, is by the Roman Editors, in their Preface and Notes, aſcribed moſt falſly to his want of Power and Authority. Thirdly, In the Proteſtation of the Clergy of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> they prove themſelves Orthodox, becauſe they held the ſame Faith with the Church of <hi>Antioch;</hi> and that which was held by <hi>Euſtathius,</hi> Biſhop there, in the time of the

And though now the Faith of the Roman Church is pretended to be the ſole Infallible Rule of what is Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, it was not thought ſo then: For Pope <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> himſelf ſaith <hi>Neſtorius</hi> is to be condemned, <hi>unleſs he profeſs the Faith of the Roman and the Alexandrian Churches, and that which the Catholick Church held</hi>

So when <hi>Cyril</hi> had informed <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> that the Roman Synod had condemned <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and writ to him, to the Biſhop of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> to thoſe of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and to him of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to joyn in this Sentence, <hi>Cyril</hi> adds, <hi>that he of</hi> Antioch <hi>muſt comply with this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, unleſs he would be deprived of the Communion of the whole Western Church, and of theſe other Great Men</hi>

This paſſage the Preface cites to prove that <hi>Cyril</hi> made uſe of the Popes Authority as his Chief Weapon in this Cauſe <note n="n" place="margin">Pref. <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 2. <hi>Lab.</hi> Pref. p. 3. <hi>Baron. An.</hi> 430. p. 539.</note>; but it is plain he doth not ſo much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Pope, or the Roman Church alone, nor doth he urge the danger of loſing the Communion of that Church, ſingly conſidered, but of all the Weſtern Churches, and divers eminent ones in the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> and it was the Popes agreeing with all theſe that made his Communion ſo valuable. Fourthly, as to the Titles of theſe Epiſtles, which were writ before the Council, we may obſerve, that <hi>Neſtorius</hi> writes to <hi>Celeſtine</hi> as to his Brother, and ſaith he would converſe with him, <hi>as one Brother uſe to do with another</hi>

which the Romaniſts would draw concluſions for their Supremacy; but we note, that in the ſame Epiſtle he calls <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> alſo <hi>his Lord, beloved Brother and Fellow-miniſter</hi> 
                           <note n="q" place="margin">Bin. &amp; Lab. <hi>ibid.</hi>
                           </note>, which very words <hi>Cyril</hi> uſes when he ſpeaks of <hi>Celestine</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Juvenal,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> calling the Pope there, <hi>his Lord, most Religious Brother and Fellow-miniſter</hi>

                           <note n="s" place="margin">Cap. 22. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 145. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 381.</note>: So <hi>John,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> calls <hi>Neſtorius, his Lord</hi>

And of this we might give many more inſtances, but theſe may ſuffice to expoſe thoſe vain Arguers, who from ſome ſuch Titles beſtowed on the Roman Biſhop, think to eſtabliſh his Univerſal Supremacy. Fifthly, Among all theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminary Epiſtles, there are none meaner, both for Style and Senſe, than thoſe of Pope <hi>Celeſtine;</hi> yet <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> brags of that to <hi>Nestorius,</hi> as the Principal Thing which confuted him, calling it a Divine Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <note n="w" place="margin">Baron. An. 430. <hi>pag.</hi> 534.</note>. But alas it is infinitely ſhort of <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Letters; the Phraſe is very ordinary, the Periods intricate, the Arguments ſuch as might have been uſed againſt any Heretick, and his Application of the Holy Texts very odd; as when the Church of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> diſcovered <hi>Nestorius</hi> to be a Heretick, he ſaith, he may uſe St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, <hi>we know not what to pray for as we ought</hi>

However there is one remarkable Paſſage in it (a little after) where he ſaith, <hi>Thoſe things which the Apostles have fully and plainly declared to us, ought neither to be augmented nor diminiſhed.</hi> Had his Succeſſors obſerved this Rule, a great part of their <hi>Trent</hi> Articles had never been eſtabliſhed: And it had been well if the Editors had not in that very Page left out by deſign, one of <hi>Celeſtine</hi>'s own words.

Moreover, it is remarkable, that the Council begins without the Popes Legates, who did not come till the three Seſſions of the firſt Act was over. But there is one notorious falſhood both in the Notes and in <hi>Baronius,</hi> which they deviſe purely in favour of the Pope, and to make him ſeem to have had ſome Supremacy in this Council: For they ſay, <hi>that in the very firſt Action,</hi> Peter, <hi>a Priest of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>did read that which Pope</hi> Celeſtine <hi>and</hi> Cyril <hi>writ againſt</hi> Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius <note n="f" place="margin">

Finally, we may note, that <hi>John,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> being ſecretly a favourer of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> would not joyn with <hi>Cyril</hi> or <hi>Celeſtine</hi> in condemning him, but held a ſeparate Council with ſuch Biſhops as were of

his party, and there they Excommunicated and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>Memnon</hi> with all that joyned with them. On the other ſide, the lawful general Council Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> and his accomplices; and afterwards upon his Repentance <hi>Cyril</hi> declares, he <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored him to Communion upon the terms preſcribed by the true Council of</hi> Epheſus <note n="u" place="margin">Par. 3. cap. 38. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 447. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 1153.</note>. Now if the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> had then been known and believed to be the ſupreme head of the Catholick Church, and the only infallible Judge in matters of Faith; how could the Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> ſo much as pretend to Condemn that ſide on which <hi>Celeſtine</hi> was, or to reject that Council wherein his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates ſat and voted againſt him? Or how came the Pious Emperor <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and his Officers ſo openly and ſo long to abet the party of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> againſt that of <hi>Celeſtine</hi> and <hi>Cyril?</hi> There needed but two Arguments, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe of the Popes Infallibility and Supremacy, to have confounded all the pretences of this Schiſmatical Council, and they are not ſo much as once mentioned; Which is a certain Evidence, that neither ſide knew of, or believed theſe Papal Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, uſurped in later times by that encroaching See.</p>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:108925:135"/>
Senſe, is evident from the words of the Synod it ſelf in the Preface to the Sentence by them pronounced, <hi>being convinced by divers proof, that</hi> Neſtorius <hi>holds im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Opinions, we are forced by the Canons and the Epiſtle of</hi> Celeſtine <hi>our Fellow-Minister, even with Tears to come to this ſevere Sentence againſt him, &amp;c.</hi>

For nothing is plainer, than that the Council did always intend to examin this Cauſe over again; and for that reaſon they cited <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and read firſt the Letters of <hi>Cyril</hi> and then of <hi>Celeſtine;</hi> and after a full hearing both of the Fathers Opinions, and of the Blaſphemies collected out of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> his Writings, finding him finally obſtinate, they pronounce Sentence on him, not in the Popes name, but thus, <hi>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath Blaſphemed, by this Holy Council Decrees, that</hi> Neſtorius <hi>ſhall be deprived of his Epiſcopal dignity, and ſhall be excluded out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Biſhops</hi>

This certainly was an Original Decree, in the name of the General Council, and by the Authority they derived from Chriſt, by which they gave force and validity to the Sentence formerly pronounced by the Pope and his Roman Council; which had ſignified nothing (againſt his Equal, a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of the Eaſtern Church, over whom he had no juriſdiction) if it had not been thus confirmed: So that it is a ſtrange extravagance to talk, as if a whole general Council in that Age were convened to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, but only to execute the Popes Decree blindly, without any enquiry into the merits of the Cauſe. And <hi>Celeſtine</hi>'s own Letter (cited by <hi>Baronius</hi> to make out this Fiction) declares he believes, <hi>the Spirit of God was preſent with the Council</hi>

Therefore the Council both Excommunicated and deprived him by their own Authority, and only left it to the Pope, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any greater ſeverity ſhould be uſed againſt him or no: 'Tis true not only the Pope <note n="x" place="margin">Par. 3. cap. 20. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 414. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 1072.</note>, but the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <note n="y" place="margin">Ibid. cap. 24. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 418. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 1081.</note> afterwards moved, that means ſhould be uſed to reconcile this Biſhop and his Party to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, by ſuſpending this Sentence a while, and procuring a meeting between <hi>Cyril</hi> and <hi>John:</hi> But ſtill it muſt not be denied, both that the Council cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him their own Authority; and that <hi>Cyril</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any leave from the Pope, did upon <hi>John</hi>'s condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> receive him into the Communion of the Catholick Church <note n="z" place="margin">Par. 3. cap. 38. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 447. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 1153.</note>.

of this, thence the Notes and <hi>Baronius</hi> infer, that this reconciliation alſo was by the Authority of the See of <hi>Rome:</hi> Whereas <hi>Cyril</hi>'s own Letter ſhews, that the Terms of admitting <hi>John,</hi> to Communion, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Council and the Emperor, and that <hi>Cyril</hi> alone effected this great work.</p>
                        <p>We may further obſerve, <hi>Binius</hi> in his Notes tells us, <hi>that after the condemnation of</hi> Neſtorius, <hi>the Fathers ſhouted forth the praiſe of</hi> Celeſtine, <hi>who had cenſured him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>

                        <p>The Editors have a Roman Council of Pope <hi>Leo</hi>'s, which was no more than a Solemn meeting of the <note place="margin">An.

But there were two remarkable things in <hi>Leo</hi>'s proceeding againſt them, of which the Notes ſay nothing; but <hi>Baronius</hi> informs us <note n="h" place="margin">
                              <hi>Baron. An.</hi> 443. pag. 14. Tom. 6.</note>, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That he diſcovered the Manicheans by their refuſing to drink of the Cop in the Bleſſed Sacrament, which this Pope counts a great impiety in this ſort of People, not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing that his Succeſſors would take the Cup away from all the People of that Church. And this paſſage makes it clear, that all the People at <hi>Rome,</hi> who were Orthodox, did receive the Cup then, or elſe the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks not receiving it could not have diſcovered them. <hi>Secondly, Baronius</hi> notes, that becauſe theſe Manicheans idolatrouſly adored the riſing Sun; <hi>Leo</hi> forbid the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox People to uſe that innocent and ancient Cuſtom of bowing toward the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> for the peril of Idolatry:
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:108925:140"/>
Now had there been any Images adored in his time; for the ſame reaſon he muſt rather have forbidden bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down before them.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Council at <hi>Rome</hi> under <hi>Leo,</hi> was in the <note place="margin">An.

                              <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 1461.</note>. But he (as ſuch ill Men had often done) flies to <hi>Rome</hi> to complain; and <hi>Leo</hi> not conſidering the equity of the cenſure, but <hi>Hilary</hi>'s having acted as a Primate in thoſe parts of <hi>France,</hi> contrary to the Decrees of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Popes, eſpouſes this evil Biſhops Quarrel, being more concerned for his deſigned uſurpation of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, than the honour of the Church. Upon this <hi>Hilary,</hi> who was one of the moſt pious and learned Men of that Age, goes on foot to <hi>Rome,</hi> and requires the Pope to act <hi>more ſolito, in the accuſtomed manner, and not to admit ſuch to Communion, who had been juſtly condemned in their own Country</hi> 
                           <note n="k" place="margin">
                              <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 1462.</note>; and when he ſaw the Pope was reſolved to break the Canons, and ſet up his Supremacy by right or wrong, he ſuddenly departs from <hi>Rome</hi> without taking any leave of <hi>Leo,</hi> for which the Angry Pope writes to the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Hilary</hi>'s Acts <hi>null,</hi> and depriving him of his Power, to Congregate Synods and Depoſe Biſhops, &amp;c. <note n="l" place="margin">

And ſince their Champions alledge this Edict as a proof of the Roman univerſal Supremacy, I will obſerve upon it, Firſt, That it was eaſie for the Pope to cite falſe Canons to a young and eaſy Emperor, and perſuade him, that the Councils had given him this Supremacy, as his Predeceſſors had lately done in <hi>Africa.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That the Pope probably drew up this Edict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo put in theſe Flouriſhes about his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:

Which will be more plain if we conſider, that the Emperor <hi>Leo</hi> in one of his Edicts ſaith, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople <hi>is the Mother of the Orthodox Religion of all Chriſtians,</hi> with much more to this purpoſe <note n="n" place="margin">

                        <p>§. 6. In a Synod held at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> under <hi>Flavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">An.

                              <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 504. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 1467. <hi>Baron. An.</hi> 448. pag. 55.</note>, make ſome remarks which muſt be conſidered: For firſt, when <hi>Eutyches</hi> ſaith, <hi>He would ſubſcribe the Nicene and Epheſine Councils, ſo far as they were agreeable to Scripture;</hi> They note this was <hi>(more Haereticorum) according to the manner of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks:</hi> But I would ask Firſt, Whether it be not true, that the Decrees of Councils in matters of Faith, are
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:108925:142"/>
no further obligatory than they are proved by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Secondly, Whether the moſt Orthodox Fathers <hi>Athanaſius, Cyril, &amp;c.</hi> did not always appeal to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the firſt place? And the greateſt Councils ever confirm their determinations firſt by Scripture? Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Whether any of the Adverſaries of <hi>Eutyches</hi> in that Age did cenſure him, for appealing firſt to Scripture? <hi>Baronius</hi> himſelf cites <hi>Flavianus</hi> his Letter, wherein he firſt alledges Scripture, and then the Expoſitions of the Fathers <note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>Baron. An.</hi> 449. pag. 76.</note>. And Pope <hi>Leo</hi> ſaith <hi>Eutyches</hi> erred, <hi>by not having recourſe to the Prophets, Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, but to himſelf</hi> 
                           <note n="c" place="margin">Ep. x. <hi>Leon.</hi> M. ad <hi>Flav.</hi> inter ep. <hi>Leon.</hi> pag. 304.</note>; ſo that it was no fault in <hi>Eutyches</hi> to prefer Scripture before the Fathers expoſitions; nor to appeal to it; but to expound it wrongfully was his Crime, and that is <hi>(more Haereticorum.)</hi> Secondly, When <hi>Eutyches</hi> petitioned <hi>Theodoſius</hi> in this caſe, for a ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to the Synod, <hi>Binius</hi> adds to his Authors words, that this was alſo <hi>after the manner of Hereticks:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it appears, that divers of the Orthodox have applied themſelves to the Emperors to aſſiſt and ſupport them, and none oftner than Pope <hi>Leo</hi> himſelf; ſo that a thing done as frequently by the Orthodox as Hereticks, can be no ſign or mark of Hereſy. Thirdly, <hi>Binius</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, that Eutyches <hi>appealed from this Synod to Pope</hi> Leo: Now this is confuted by the very Acts of the Synod, related in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by <hi>Baronius,</hi> where it is ſaid, Eutyches <hi>appealed to the Council of the Roman Biſhop, and of the Biſhops of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria, Hieruſalem <hi>and</hi> Theſſalonica <note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>Baron. An.</hi> 449. pag. 75.</note>; yet they make as if this had been an Appeal only to the Pope. Fourthly, <hi>Binius</hi> notes, <hi>the Appeal was not admitted:</hi> I reply, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> did ſo far receive <hi>Eutyches</hi> Letter, that he writ three Epiſtles on his behalf, before he was informed of the true State of the Caſe, and quarrelled with <hi>Flavianus</hi> for condemning a convicted Heretick, before he had conſulted him <note n="e" place="margin">
                              <hi>Leon.</hi> Ep. 6, 7, &amp; 8.</note>. But in truth there was no Appeal at all: <hi>Flavianus</hi> did write indeed to <hi>Leo,</hi> (and probably to all other Patriarchs) after the Canonical Judgment was over, to acquaint them with
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:108925:143"/>
his proceedings; that ſo they might not break the Canons, by admitting an Heretick in one Church, who was Excommunicated in another: But the Style of <hi>Flavianus</hi> his Letter ſhews, that he need not ask <hi>Leo</hi>'s leave to cenſure an Heretical Prieſt of his own Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, nor doth he deſire the Pope to confirm his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but only to make it known <note n="f" place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian.</hi> ad <hi>Leon.</hi> inter Epiſt. <hi>Leon.</hi> pag. 298.</note>: So that <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> falſly infers the Popes power to judge of Hereſy, and confirm all Sentences againſt them, from this Letter of <hi>Flavianus:</hi> And he as falſly makes the like inference from <hi>Eutyches</hi> writing to <hi>Leo,</hi> as if <hi>he knew of what weight the Popes judgment was, for which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils in doubtful Caſes uſe to ſtay, and to which all the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church would certainly incline</hi>

                              <hi>Baron. An.</hi> 448. pag. 63.</note>. For <hi>Eutyches</hi> writ to other Biſhops of <hi>Italy</hi> as well as the Pope, (as <hi>Baronius</hi> in that Page confeſſeth) and conſidered <hi>Leo</hi> no otherwiſe than as one Eminent Biſhop: And this Synod of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſtayed not for the Popes Judgment, nor did thoſe Biſhops who deſpiſed the Decree of this Synod, value Pope <hi>Leo</hi>'s Judgment after he had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for <hi>Flavianus:</hi> So little truth is there in the Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts pompous obſervations, which only ſhew, that all his aim is from every paſſage, to extort ſome kind of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for his dear Supremacy.</p>
                        <p>In the ſame year were two Synods, one at <hi>Tyre,</hi> the other at <hi>Berithus,</hi> in the cauſe of one <hi>Ibas</hi> a Syrian Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, wherein the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> were concerned; but the Pope is not once mentioned in the whole proceedings <note n="h" place="margin">

But the great uſe the Romaniſts make of theſe Letters, is on account of ſome high Expreſſions in them about <hi>the Popes having a Power over all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi>

But there is ſome doubt whether theſe Epiſtles are genuine, the Story of their being at <hi>Rome</hi> the night after St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s day, not agreeing to the time when theſe pretended Epiſtles muſt be writ: But if they be not forged, <hi>Rome</hi> will gain nothing by <hi>theſe phraſes,</hi> which <hi>Leo</hi> put into their Mouths; for he certainly endited theſe Letters for them, as we may know by this Evidence, that the Emperors Mother, <hi>Galla Placidia</hi> (who underſtood no more of the Canons than the Pope told her) <hi>cites the Canon of</hi> Sardica, for <hi>a Canon of</hi> Nice <note n="d" place="margin">Ep. <hi>Gal.

Wherefore we can make no doubt that the main confirmation of the Acts of this Council was from the Emperor.</p>
                        <p>§. 3. In the next place we will conſider the ſeveral Seſſions and Acts which were in number ſixteen. In the firſt Action, <hi>Baronius,</hi> by miſtake, affirms, that the Emperor was preſent <note n="z" place="margin">Baron.

To which I anſwer, The Council no where gives the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> any of theſe extravagant Titles, and did ſo little regard theſe empty brags of the Legates, that in the firſt Act, the Judges do reject the very firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt which <hi>Leo</hi>'s Legates made to the Council; and when they petitioned in <hi>Leo</hi>'s name, that <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> might ſtand at the Bar, the Judges bid him ſit down <note n="e" place="margin">Act. 1. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 41. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 94.</note>: And if we conſider how zealous this ambitious Pope was for the Dignity of his See, and that his Legates had been taught their Leſſon at <hi>Rome,</hi> we may juſtly argue from the Councils ſilence, and the lower Style of Arch-Biſhop which they give him, that theſe big Thraſonical Titles were not believed nor appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them; for many things are reported in the Councils, as ſaid by particular perſons, which were not the Act of the whole Council; for which reaſon <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> egregiouſly prevaricates, when he makes this whole General Council to call <hi>Peter the Rock and Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of the Catholick Church</hi>

I ſhall make no more remarks upon this firſt Seſſion, which was ſpent in reading over and reviewing the Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> wherein <hi>Eutyches</hi> was condemned, and the Pſeudo-Synod of <hi>Epheſus</hi> wherein <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> abſolved him, becauſe I have treated of both before: It is ſufficient to obſerve upon this full hearing, the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> condemned both <hi>Eutyches</hi> and <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> and the Lay-Judges ſumm'd up the Act; but there ſeems to be a Roman addition in the end of this firſt Act, where it is thruſt in without choerence and ſenſe, <hi>that</hi> Leo <hi>writ an Epiſtle to</hi> Flavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus; which, though it be true <note n="l" place="margin">In fin. Act. 1. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 153. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 310.</note>, comes in very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently here; but the Forger thought when the Writings of the Orthodox Fathers were mentioned, that of <hi>Leo</hi> ought by all means to be mentioned right or wrong.</p>
                        <p>In the ſecond Action there is nothing conſiderable, but the reading of this very Epiſtle of <hi>Leo</hi> to <hi>Flavia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> (after the Nicene and Conſtantinopolitan Creed) being written expreſly about the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Hereſie, the main Cauſe to be then decided <note n="m" place="margin">Act. 2. <hi>Bin</hi> pag. 151. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 344.</note>; which was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore received there as other Orthodox Writings were, with general Acclamations; but the Notes, citing theſe Acclamations, quote them imperfectly no further than theſe words, Peter <hi>ſpeaks by</hi> Leo <note n="n" place="margin">Not. in Concil. <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 412. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 986.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:108925:153"/>
infallibility of his See which procured his Epiſtle this general applauſe. Wherefore the Prefacer need not have mentioned theſe Acclamations, as if they were only given to <hi>Leo</hi>'s Epiſtle, or had been made upon ſome ſingle excellency peculiar to the Biſhop of that See <note n="o" place="margin">Pref. <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 4. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 7.</note>; for both the Creeds, and two of <hi>Cyril</hi>'s Epiſtles had been honoured with ſuch like Acclamations a little before.</p>
                        <p>The third Action contains the canonical depoſition of <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> after the Biſhops had heard all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt him, cited him thrice, and could not prevail with him to appear. Now there being nothing to be done at this Seſſion, but to proceed according to the Canons, of which the Biſhops were the proper Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors; they only met, without Lay Judges, which (ſaith <hi>Binius) is the most evident note of a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>

The next thing to be noted is, a corruption in the Titles of the Petitions, which ſome of the Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian Clergy offered to the Council againſt <hi>Dioſcorus;</hi> for the Greek hath no more but this, <hi>The Petition of</hi> Theodorus, <hi>the Deacon,</hi> exhibited againſt <hi>Dioſcorus;</hi> but the Latin Verſion thruſts in Pope <hi>Leo</hi>'s name thus, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to Pope</hi> Leo <hi>and the Council of</hi> Chalcedon <note n="q" place="margin">Act. 3. <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 181. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 396.</note>, and the ſame corruption is in the Titles of the following Petitions of <hi>Iſchyrion, Athanaſius</hi> and <hi>Sophronius.</hi> If it be objected, that the Superſcriptions of all theſe Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both in Greek and Latin are, <hi>To the moſt Holy,</hi> &amp;c.<hi>—Univerſal Patriarch of Great</hi> Rome, Leo, <hi>and to the Holy General Council,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="r" place="margin">Baron. An. 451. <hi>pag.</hi> 144.</note>: I reply, theſe Superſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſeem to be forged alſo: For firſt, <hi>Euſebius</hi> his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition before, mentions not <hi>Leo,</hi> and theſe Petitions are addreſſed only to the Council, there being not the leaſt ſentence in them peculiar to <hi>Leo,</hi> or ſuppoſing him to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:108925:153"/>
ſee or read them; ſo that theſe Superſcriptions to an abſent Biſhop are non-ſenſe, and in all probability ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſome Roman Tranſcribers, as may be gueſſed by the great ſwelling Titles, with which the Pope is loaded. Again, in the Summons ſent to <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> the third time, it is declared, <hi>that the Emperor had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Biſhops to hear this Cauſe;</hi> the Greek word is [<gap reason="foreign">

However, whether the Emperor commanded or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Biſhops to hear this Cauſe, it is plain, that even in this Seſſion, conſiſting only of Clergy, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops had the Emperors leave, and proceeded by his permiſſion.

But theſe Rhetorical Flouriſhes, coming only from the Popes Domeſticks, give him no right to them; it is more material what Cardinal <hi>Cuſanus</hi> obſerves, <hi>that the Legates, as ſitting firſt in this Council, firſt pronounce Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence by the Synods command, and then all she reſt in order;

and the force of the Sentence depends upon the agreeing Votes of all: And we ſee, that though the Pope had before canonically depoſed</hi> Dioſcorus, <hi>yet his Sentence was re-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a General Council</hi>

Now had theſe Fathers believed the Pope to be Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in matters of Faith, they muſt have received this Epiſtle only upon the Credit of the Pope; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they now examin and judge of it by the Rules preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in former Councils, and receive it, not becauſe the Enditer of it was Infallible, but becauſe he had kept cloſe to former determinations in General Councils.

and condemn the Hereſie of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> againſt which new Sect no eminent Biſhop but <hi>Leo</hi> had written, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Epiſtle was made a Teſt, and all were obliged to ſubſcribe it, not (as the Romaniſts brag) becauſe the See of <hi>Rome</hi> was to fix the Rule of Faith; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this was the only Writing then extant of this kind; and we may as well prove that St. <hi>Cyril</hi> was the Supream Biſhop of the World, and the ſole Arbiter of Faith, becauſe his Epiſtles were ſubſcribed in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as a Teſt to find out and condemn the Neſtorians, as infer the Roman Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy or Infallibility from the Biſhops ſubſcribing <hi>Leo</hi>'s Epiſtle at <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> We may further note in this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that how confidently-ſoever modern Editors place the Councils of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Epheſus, under</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſus <hi>and</hi> Celeſtine; the Popes Legates here plainly ſay the Council of <hi>Constantinople</hi> was held <hi>under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> Theodoſius <note n="g" place="margin">Act. 4. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 217. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 471.</note>; and other Biſhops affirm, that Cyril <hi>was the Preſident and Head of the Council at</hi> Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus <note n="h" place="margin">Ib. <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 218, &amp; 221. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 474, &amp; 482.</note>: Again, it is to be noted, that though <hi>Juvena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and four other Biſhops who had joyned with</hi> Dioſcorus <hi>in the Synod at</hi> Epheſus, <hi>to condemn Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vianus, repented and had ſubſcribed</hi> Leo'<hi>s Epiſtle, and ſo declared themſelves to be Orthodox; yet the Council could not reſtore them to their Places, till the Emperor, by his Judges, gave them leave to determine their Caſe</hi>

                           <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 4. <hi>Bin</hi> p. 245. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 544.</note>. From whence <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> infers, <hi>that Princes ought to learn from hence to make their Laws ſubmit to the Eccleſiastical Canons</hi> 
                           <note n="n" place="margin">Baron. An. 451. <hi>p.</hi> 149.</note>. But it muſt be noted, this was not intended to be a Rule in all Caſes, only as to the old Rights of Biſhops Juriſdictions; and it was a Rule made now, only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion; and which is moſt remarkable, the Judges tell the Council, <hi>it was the Emperor's pleaſure, this Cauſe ſhould be tried, nor by the Edicts, but by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons;</hi> for which the Biſhops gave that pious Emperor thanks: And therefore it is a great fallacy to argue from hence, that Eccleſiaſtical Canons are above the Laws of Princes in their own nature; only in this Caſe the Good Emperor, to oblige the Biſhops, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Canons to prevail. To conclude, this Seſſion ended with a confirmation of all things done by the Lay-Judges, who declare they ſhould remain firm <note n="o" place="margin">Act. 4. <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 248. <hi>Lab.</hi> col 552.</note>, and ſo the Seſſion ended.</p>
                        <p>In the Fifth Action, wherein the Matters of Faith were to be declared, the Emperors Legates were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and prevented a Schiſm which was like to happen among the Biſhops, ſome of which would not conſent to the Councils definition; but the Lay-Judges from
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:108925:155"/>
the Emperor adviſed the Diſſenters to go with <hi>Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> and the Popes Legates, and to confer among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo as they might agree, otherwiſe they threatned that the Emperor reſolved to call a Council in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> to which they muſt go to determin the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference <note n="p" place="margin">Act. v. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 250. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 560.</note>: From whence we may note, that they knew of no ſingle Perſon who could finally decide queſtions of Faith; and though it was to be determined at <hi>Rome,</hi> a general Council muſt do it there: However, this Method proved effectual, and ſo they publiſhed their Faith unanimouſly, annexing it to the Creeds of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> 
                           <note n="q" place="margin">Ib. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 251. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 561.</note>. We ſhall only note further, that in the Acclamations made in this Seſſion it is ſaid, <hi>That the Councils definition had confirmed</hi> Leo'<hi>s Epiſtle, and the Faith of</hi> Leo <hi>is commended becauſe he believed as</hi> Cyril <hi>believed:</hi> And after all, the Biſhops agreement was not ſufficient to ratifie this definition of Faith, till it was ſhewed to the Emperor <note n="r" place="margin">Ib. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 254. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 568.</note> as the laſt words import.</p>
                        <p>The Sixth Action was adorned with the preſence of the Emperor <hi>Marcianus,</hi> who made a Speech to the Fathers, (which <hi>Baronius</hi> by miſtake ſaith was in the firſt Seſſion <note n="s" place="margin">Baron. An. 450, <hi>pag.</hi> 141.</note>;) telling them he was come to confirm the Faith they had agreed on, (as <hi>Constantine</hi> did) not to ſhew his power <note n="t" place="margin">Act. vi. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 258. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 577.</note>. Which is a clear and undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proof, that the confirmation of their Decrees de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the Emperor, in whoſe preſence the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Faith was read and ſubſcribed by every one of the Biſhops; and he declared his Approbation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and in the open Synod appoints penalties for them who ſhould, after this, call theſe Points into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion <note n="u" place="margin">Ib. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 269, &amp;c. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 608.</note>. And then he gives them ſome Rules, to be formed into Canons, becauſe they related to Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Affairs; after which having been highly Applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Biſhops, he was petitioned to dimiſs them, but told them they muſt not depart for ſome few days, and ſo took his leave of them. Which ſhews that the Emperor who convened them, had alſo the ſole power to diſſolve this general Council: I ſhall add what <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherius</hi>
                           <pb n="104" facs="tcp:108925:156"/>
obſerves upon that definition of Faith made in this Seſſion, that it contains many of the very words and expreſſions of the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed; and though he doubt whether <hi>Athanaſius</hi> did compoſe that Form which bears his name; yet he ſaith, <hi>It is now become the Creed of the Catholick Church, and there is not a Tittle in it which is not agreeable to the Credit, Holineſs and Learning of</hi> Athanaſius <note n="w" place="margin">
                              <hi>Richer.</hi> Hiſt. Concil. gen. Tom. 1. pag. 407.</note>. He notes alſo the policy of the Popes Legates, who contrary to all ancient uſage, and to the Primitive ſimplicity of the former Councils, do moſt impertinently put this Epithete to the Popes name, <hi>Biſhop of the Univerſal Church of the City of</hi> Rome <note n="x" place="margin">Act. 6. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 259. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 580.</note>. But when I conſider the abſurdity of the expreſſion, and the frequent corruptions in theſe Acts, why might not that bold hand who added to the Legates name, <hi>Preſident of the Council;</hi> in this very place (and in this Seſſion where the Emperor being preſent certainly preſided) add this huffing Title to the Pope's name? And if ſo, it is a corruption and can be no ground for an Argument: However, 'tis a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to all theſe Titles, that when any others of the Council ſpeak of the Pope, they call him only <hi>Biſhop or Archbiſhop, and none but his own Legates load him with thoſe vain Titles.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Seventh Action contains only the Ratification of a private Agreement, made between <hi>Maximus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Juvenalis</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> concerning the extent of their Juriſdictions <note n="y" place="margin">Act. 7. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 271. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 612.</note>.</p>
                        <p>The Eighth Action was the caſe of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who having formerly favoured <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> yet being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards convinced of his Error, was received into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion by Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> who had judged his cauſe and acquitted him before the Council met: But for all that, the caſe was heard over again, and he called an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and had been expelled the Council, if he had not cleared himſelf over again by ſubſcribing <hi>Leo</hi>'s Epiſtle, and <hi>Anathematizing Neſtorius</hi> and <hi>Eutyches,</hi> upon which he was reſtored to Communion and to his Biſhoprick <note n="z" place="margin">Act. 8. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 273. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 617.</note>: By which it is as clear as the Sun, that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:108925:156"/>
the Council was above the Pope, and had Authority to Judge over again the Cauſes he had determined; and alſo that barely being in Communion with the Pope, could not clear any Man from Hereſie, nor give him a right to the Communion of the Catholick Church. And if the Epiſtles of <hi>Theodoret</hi> to <hi>Leo</hi> be genuin, (whereof there is good cauſe to doubt) and this cauſe were referred to the Pope by Appeal; (as the Romaniſts brag) This makes the matter worſe, and ſhews that the laſt Appeal is not to the Pope, and that he cannot finally decide any cauſe, which ſhall not be liable to be tried again in a general Council, yea though it be, as this was, a Cauſe of Faith; which utterly ruins the Infallibility.</p>
                        <p>The Ninth and Tenth Actions, concern <hi>Ibas</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> who had been a <hi>Neſtorian,</hi> and was depoſed by <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> in the Pſeudo Synod of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> in which are theſe obſervables: Firſt, The Emperor commanded a Lay-man and ſome Neighbouring Biſhops to hear this Cauſe, firſt at <hi>Tyre,</hi> and then at <hi>Berytus</hi> 
                           <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 9 &amp; 10. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 277. &amp; pag. 280. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 628. &amp; 637.</note>; ſo that even Provincial Councils did not meet without the Emperors Authority, and the Popes univerſal ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy was not known then. For in the Council of <hi>Berytus, Antioch</hi> is called an Apoſtolical Throne <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 10. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 283. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 644.</note>, and the Council after they had reſtored him to his Biſhoprick, referred the cauſe between him and <hi>Nonnus,</hi> (who had been thruſt into his place) to <hi>Maximus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> as the proper Judge of that matter. No more is here to be noted, but only that the Popes Legates and the whole Council deſire, that the Emperor would revoke and utterly annul the Epheſine falſe Synod <note n="d" place="margin">Ib. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 294. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 673.</note>. For though the Pope had done this, yet they knew that was inſufficient, ſince none but the Emperor had right effectually to confirm, or null a Council which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be Oecumenical. To this Action <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> tack another, concerning an allowance to be made to maintain <hi>Domnus</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who had been depoſed <note n="e" place="margin">
                              <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 298. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 681. <hi>Baron. An.</hi> 451. pag. 155.</note>: But they own this is not
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:108925:157"/>
in the Greek, nor was there any ſuch thing in the Acts of the Council in <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s time, who expreſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms <hi>Domnus</hi> was dead before, which is certainly true <note n="f" place="margin">Vid. Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenthorp. vigil. dormit. chap. 35. §. 9.</note>; Wherefore the Cardinal owns they found this in an old Latin Copy, in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> the very Mint of Forgeries; and this Action ought to be rejected as a mear Fiction.</p>
                        <p>The Eleventh and Twelfth Actions were ſpent in examing the cauſe of <hi>Baſſianus</hi> and <hi>Stephanus,</hi> both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be Biſhops of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> wherein we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: That <hi>Baſſianus</hi> pleads, he was duly elected by the ſuffrage of the Nobility, People and Clergy of that City and the Emperor confirmed the Election <note n="g" place="margin">Act. 11. <hi>Bin</hi> pag. 300. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 688.</note>; for the Pope had not then uſurped the nomination or confirmation of remote Biſhops. Again, whereas <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> brags, <hi>that the Pope depoſed</hi> Baſſianus <hi>from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of</hi> Epheſus, and cites the words of <hi>Stephen</hi> his <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> thus, <hi>it is now four years ſince the Roman Biſhop depoſed</hi> Baſſianus—<hi>arguing from thence, That it was the ancient uſage for the Pope to depoſe Metropolitans</hi> 
                           <note n="h" place="margin">Baron. An. 447. <hi>pag.</hi> 49.</note>; He doth notoriouſly prevaricate, for <hi>Stephen</hi>'s words are, <hi>ſince the Roman Biſhop depoſed him, and the Biſhop of</hi> Alexandria <hi>condemned him:</hi> And a little before the ſame <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaith more fully, <hi>That</hi> Baſſianus <hi>was expelled by the holy Fathers,</hi> Leo <hi>and</hi> Flavianus <hi>and the Biſhops of</hi> Alexandria <hi>and</hi> Antioch <note n="i" place="margin">Act. 11. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 301. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 689.</note>. By which the Reader may ſee there is no credit to be given to <hi>Baronius</hi> Quotations, who always reſolves by falſe Citations of Authors, to aſcribe that to the Pope alone, which was done by him in conjunction with other Biſhops: And it appears, that the principal right over <hi>Epheſus</hi> was in the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whence it was pleaded by the Friends of Baſſianus, <hi>that</hi> Proclus <hi>of</hi> Conſtontinople <hi>who had the right, received him to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:</hi> And <hi>Stephen</hi> urges, <hi>that</hi> Flavianus <hi>of</hi> Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinople <hi>expelled him afterwards</hi>

And therefore it is remarkable, that in the twefth Action where the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was to be pronounced, <hi>Anatolius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> declares his Judgment before the Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:108925:157"/>
and is always named before them in all that Seſſion, where a Cauſe was to be decided concerning a Church, which was ſpecially under his juriſdiction <note n="l" place="margin">Act. 12. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 305, 306. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 771. &amp;c.</note>; by which it appears, the principal Perſon in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of <hi>Baſſianus,</hi> was the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who probably deſired the other great Patriarchs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence for the better credit of his Sentence: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it is to be noted, that though Pope <hi>Leo</hi> favoured the cauſe of <hi>Stephen,</hi> and writ an Epiſtle in his behalf mentioned in the Council; The Popes favour did him no ſervice, for his Cauſe was tried over again, and he depoſed by this general Council as well as <hi>Baſſianus;</hi> and this by the conſent of the Popes Legates, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their big words, did not believe it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for a general Council to contradict a determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Popes.</p>
                        <p>The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Actions concern on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Cauſes of private Biſhops, who had complained to the Emperor (not to the Pope) of injury done them; and the Emperor appointed them to be finally determined by the Council, and ſo the Biſhop of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomedias</hi>'s Juriſdiction was cleared, and the Biſhop of <hi>Nice</hi> ordered to be content only with the honour of a Metropolitan <note n="m" place="margin">Act. 13. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 307. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 708.</note>. And in the fourteenth Action <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius</hi> was ſetled in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Perrhaea;</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binianus,</hi> who claimed it, ordered to keep the honour of a Biſhop, and to be maintained out of the Profits of that Church, as the Patriarch of <hi>Antiooh</hi> ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect <note n="n" place="margin">Act. 14. <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 311. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 717.</note>. Nothing is remarkable in them, but only that the Lay Judges pronounce the Decree, and not the Popes Legates, and then the Synod conſent.</p>
                        <p>The Fifteenth Action contains the Canons of this General Council for Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, three of which were recommended to the Fathers by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to be formed into Canons <note n="o" place="margin">Supr. Act. 6.</note>: So that in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Emperor, they were obliged to make ſome Eccleſiaſtical Rules: And one of theſe is the fourth Canon, which decrees, that all Monks every where ſhall be ſubject to the Biſhop of that Dioceſs
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:108925:158"/>
wherein their Monaſtery is built <note n="p" place="margin">Act. 15. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 326. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 757.</note>; which being a genuine Canon of a General Council, not objected againſt by the Popes Legates, it is ſomewhat ſtrange that the Modern Popes have no regard to it, but daily and openly break it, in defiance of the Primitive Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, by exempting all Monaſteries from due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to their own Biſhop <note n="q" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Bever.</hi> not. in Can. Chalced. 4. Tom. 2. p. 111.</note>; and this meerly out of policy to make the Monks intirely depend upon the Pope, and ſerve his intereſts. The ninth Canon or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains, that the Cauſes betwen Clergy-men ſhall be tried before their own Biſhop, and not in Secular Courts; and if a Biſhop have a complaint againſt his Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan, he ſhall go <hi>to the Primate of the Dioceſs, or appeal to the See of</hi> Conſtantinople: Which Canon Pope <hi>Nicholus</hi> reſolved to force into his intereſt, and ſo ridiculouſly expounds, <hi>the Primate of the Dioceſs,</hi> is meant the <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>who is Primate of all Dioceſes</hi>

But all theſe feigned additions and forced gloſſes will not help them, becauſe the Canon gives leave to the Party in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured to complain, either to the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> or to the Pope, at his own choice, which ſets that Patriarch upon equal ground with him of <hi>Rome.</hi> But the Original Word ſignifies an Order of Biſhops below a Patriarch, but above a Metropolitan; and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non expreſly limits Appeals either to be made by theſe, <gap reason="foreign">

And if any queſtion why the Pope is not here named, at leaſt, for the Weſtern Churches Appeals, as well as the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for the Eaſtern; I take the true reaſon to be, the abſence of the Popes Legates from this Seſſion, conſiſting only of Oriental Biſhops; for which reaſon they modeſtly refuſed to decree any thing concerning Diſcipline in

the <hi>Weſt,</hi> leaving affairs there to proceed according to parity of Reaſon. We may add, that the Latin Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſixteenth Canon hath put in the word <hi>[con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitentes]</hi> into the Body of the Canon, which is not in the Original <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 328.</note>, but <hi>Labbè</hi> leaves out this corruption.</p>
                        <p>But that which hath occaſioned the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, is the twenty eighth Canon, <hi>wherein this Council confirms the Decrees of the Fathers, and the ſecond Council of</hi> Conſtantinoples <hi>Canon about the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of that See. For as the Fathers had given the See of</hi> Rome <hi>its priviledges, becauſe it was the Imperial City, for the ſame reaſon the ſecond General Council gave like honour to the See of</hi> Conſtantinople; <hi>and would have it alſo even in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, to be advanced to the ſecond place: And they order that the Biſhop of</hi> Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople <hi>ſhould ordain and have a Juriſdiction over all the Metropolitans of the Dioceſes of</hi> Pontus, Aſia <hi>and</hi> Thrace <note n="t" place="margin">Act. 15. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 330. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 769.</note>. The Modern Romaniſts do all they can to ſuppreſs or baffle this Canon. The Editors put a Note before it, that it is not in their Greek Manuſcripts; but that is no wonder, ſince it hath been long the deſign of their Church to conceal this Canon; but that ſuch a Canon was really made at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> is apparent, not only from the ſixteenth Action, where it was read at large, and allowed by the whole Council, and confirmed by the Lay-Judges, notwithſtanding the oppoſition of the Popes Legates; But it is alſo found in all the Greek Collectors, cited in <hi>Photius</hi> his Nomo-Canon (writ above 900 year ago) and is alſo extant in that old Latin Interpreter, who put out the Canons before <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oniſius exiguus</hi> (that is, ſoon after the year 500) <note n="u" place="margin">

                        <p>In the Sixteenth Action the Popes Legates complain to the Judges, before all the Council, <hi>That this Canon was made after their departure, and irregularly; and deſire it may be read: They were anſwered by the Arch-Deacon of</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>that it was cuſtomary in General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils to treat of Diſcipline after matters of Faith; that they told the Popes Legates this, and deſired their concurrence as to what ſhould be done for the Church of</hi> Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople; <hi>but they refuſed, ſaying they had other Orders; upon this they acquainted the Judges, and they commanded the Council to proceed; and ſo they did, nothing being done fraudulently, but all publickly and canonically; upon this the Canon aforeſaid was read</hi> 
                           <note n="y" place="margin">Act. 16. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 333. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 792.</note>. Then the Legates Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were heard and anſwered; Firſt to his inſinuation, that it was fraudulently obtained: The Biſhops all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> newly ſubjected to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that they conſented and ſubſcribed to this Canon, without any circumvention or force, voluntarily and freely. Secondly, whereas the Legates pretended it was contrary to the Nicene Canons; and cite the ſixth Canon of <hi>Nice</hi> falſly, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this forged Title <hi>(That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>always had the Primacy)</hi> into the body of the Canon: The Council firſt diſcovers the fallacy by reading a true and authentick Record of that Canon, without that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Addition, (though ſtill <hi>Baronius</hi>

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:108925:159"/>
of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> was thought ſo agreeable, that the Biſhops principally concerned, declared again, they had freely ſubſcribed it as agreeable both to the Canons and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom. And <hi>Euſebius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Dorylaeum,</hi> declares he read that Canon of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> here confirmed, to the Pope at <hi>Rome,</hi> and he owned it: Where by the way, <hi>Baronius</hi> egregiouſly prevaricates in expounding <hi>hanc regulam</hi> (that is, this Canon of the ſecond Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council) of <hi>Euſebius</hi> his rule or confeſſion of Faith <note n="b" place="margin">

To proceed, whereas the Legates objected Thirdly, That the Biſhops of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had not formerly uſed the Rights now conſerred on them; the contrary is manifeſt, both as to precedence, ſince all the Acts of this Council ſhew; that <hi>Anatolius</hi> ſate and ſpoke in the ſecond place next to the Popes Legates; and they had ſaid in the firſt Act, that his due was the ſecond place <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 1. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 50. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 115.</note>. And as to Juriſdiction, the very Biſhops of theſe Provinces do in theſe Acts, declare the Patriarchs of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had uſed it in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Dioceſes for many years: Upon which the Judges pronounce the Sentence, and give the ſecond place to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with the Patriarchal Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over thoſe Provinces named in the Canon, to which the whole Council conſents, except the Popes Legate, who entred his Proteſtation againſt it; but ſtill the Biſhops ſtood firm to the Canon, and the Judges declare it valid, with which this General Council is concluded. <hi>Baronius</hi> thinks the final Acclamations are wanting <note n="d" place="margin">Baron. An. 451. <hi>pag.</hi> 158.</note>; if they be ſo, we may eaſily gueſs who raſed them out; even that Church which then, and ſince hath oppoſed this Canon, and would conceal that General Conſent by which it paſſed. But the laſt words are plain enough, where the Judges ſay, <hi>The whole Synod hath confirmed it</hi>

I ſhall conclude this Hiſtory of Fact, when I have noted two Corruptions in favour of the Roman Church, which are evident in this laſt Act. Firſt, The Latin Verſion affirms the Judges ſaid, Rome
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:108925:160"/>
                           <hi>truly, by the Canons had all the Primacy, omnem Primatum;</hi> but the Greek is, <gap reason="foreign">

Again, the Legates in the Latin Copy ſay, <hi>The Apoſtolical See ought not to be humbled in our preſence;</hi> but the Greek is quite different, that is, <hi>the Apoſtolical Throne command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that all things ſhould be done in our preſence</hi> 
                           <note n="g" place="margin">Id. ibid.</note>: But he who made the alteration was one who dream'd that this Canon was to humble <hi>Rome,</hi> whereas it takes not away the firſt place from the Pope, only gives the ſecond equal Priviledges within its own bounds to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>§. 4. We ſhall now proceed to the third part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what was done after the Council, and there will ſhew that this Canon was valid, notwithſtanding the diſſent of the Popes Legates, and <hi>Leo</hi>'s furious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to annull it.</p>
                        <p>The firſt thing, after the Councils ſpeech to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, in the old Collectors of Councils, was the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Edicts, by which the Decrees were confirmed; but theſe late Editors have removed theſe into the third place <note n="h" place="margin">
                              <hi>Bin.</hi> par. 3. num. 3, &amp; 4. pag. 352, &amp;c. <hi>Lab.</hi> pag. 840.</note>: And firſt ſet down a pretended Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the Council to the Pope, which is done only to impoſe upon unwary Readers, and make them think it was not the Emperor, but the Pope who had the power of confirming the Acts. But as to the Epiſtle it ſelf, it was dated in the end of <hi>March,</hi> four Months after the Council was ſeparated; and (if it be not a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, as ſome vehemently ſuſpect, on the account of a fooliſh and improbable ſtory in it of <hi>Euphemia</hi>'s dead body confirming the true Faith by a Miracle) it was writ not by the General Council, but by <hi>Anatolius,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had heard of the Popes diſlike of the twenty eighth Canon; and therefore he doth not deſire his conſent to any other thing, but only labours to gain his aſſent to this Cannon <note n="i" place="margin">Par. 3. num. 2. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 350. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 833.</note>. So that <hi>Baronius</hi> falſly argues from hence, <hi>it was the custom to ſend the Decrees
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:108925:160"/>
of General Councils to</hi> Rome, <hi>to be confirmed by the Popes Authority</hi> 
                           <note n="k" place="margin">Baron. An. 451. <hi>pag.</hi> 159.</note>: For this Letter was not writ by a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council, nor doth it deſire a confirmation of any thing but one Canon, which ſtood firm notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pope always diſallowed it: I only note that where the original is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, that is, <hi>taking his wonted care,</hi> the Latin reads <hi>conſuete gubernando:</hi> As if the Pope had by cuſtom governed all Churches as far as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> 
                           <note n="l" place="margin">Ibid. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 351. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 837.</note>. I obſerve alſo, that <hi>Binius</hi> leaves out the date of this Epiſtle to the Pope, which is later in time than either of the Imperial Edicts; hoping by that means the cheat of placing it before thoſe Edicts would be undiſcovered, and that eaſie People might judge it a formal Letter writ while the Council was ſitting, to Petition the Pope to confirm all they had done. I ſhall not inſiſt upon any more particulars, but ſmile at <hi>Baronius,</hi> who for a few Complements, that the writer of this Letter gives the Pope, draws a ſerious Argument for the Supremacy, and would have all Biſhops, even in a General Council, to be <hi>Sons to their Holy Father the Pope</hi> 
                           <note n="m" place="margin">Baron. An. 451. <hi>pag.</hi> 159.</note>. To proceed, the Edicts of the Emperor are dated, one in <hi>February,</hi> and the other in <hi>March,</hi> and they do effectually confirm the Acts of the Council, and ordain penalties on ſuch as oppoſe the definitions of the Synod <note n="n" place="margin">Par. 3. num. 3 &amp; 4. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 352. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 840.</note>. After this follow three Letters of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> dated all of one day, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to <hi>Anatolius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and to the Emperor and Empreſs <hi>Marcianus</hi> and <hi>Pulcheria</hi> 
                           <note n="o" place="margin">Ibid. num. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 354, &amp;c. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 844.</note>, in all which he ſhews his conſent to the other things done at <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> but argues and exclaims againſt the <hi>28th</hi> Canon, ſaying in his Letter to <hi>Pulcheria, that by the Authority of</hi> Peter <hi>he utterly makes it void.</hi> But all this ſpoils the Cauſe; for notwithſtanding all his huffing, this Canon did remain in Force; for <hi>Liberatus,</hi> who writ in the next Century, ſaith, <hi>The Judges and all the Biſhops did not value the Legates proteſtation; and though the Apoſtolical See ſtill oppoſe it, this which was confirmed by the Synod, by the Emperors, Patronage remains even till now</hi> 
                           <note n="p" place="margin">
                              <hi>Liberat.</hi> Brev. cap. 13. <hi>Bin.</hi> Tom. 2. par. 2. pag. 186.</note>; and <hi>Almain</hi> of later times affirms, <hi>the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution

of the Council prevailed over the proteſtations of</hi> Leo <hi>againſt it: For the Canons of general Councils do prevail over the oppoſite Decrees of Popes</hi> 
                           <note n="q" place="margin">
                              <hi>Almain.</hi> de Eccleſ. Author. cap. 7.</note>. And the Hiſtory of following times doth clearly ſhew, that the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was ever after this reckoned the ſecond Patriarch, and took his place accordingly in ſucceeding Councils, and retained the juriſdiction over thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces which this Canon gives him: Wherefore it is very weak in <hi>Baronius,</hi> from ſome bold paſſages in <hi>Leo</hi>'s Letters to draw this conſequence, <hi>that it is clearly in the ſole power of the Pope to make void, what 630 Biſhops in Council, the Emperor and Senate had agreed on and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed</hi> 
                           <note n="r" place="margin">Baron. An. 452. <hi>pag.</hi> 166.</note>. For the contrary is clear as the Sun, that the Legates contradiction there, and the Popes ranting after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, for all his pretended Authority of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> did not ſignify any thing towards a real annulling this Canon; and the more he ſtrove to do it, the more he ſhewed his Pride to be above his Power: And indeed General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils were needleſs, precarious and inſignificant, if any one Biſhop were not to be concluded by the major vote, or had a negative voice there. But becauſe the Pope argues as well as condemns, let us hear his reaſons againſt this Canon: Firſt, He every where urges, <hi>it is contrary to the Nicene Canon:</hi> But this is falſe; he and his Legates indeed pretend this, but the Nicene Canon was read over in open Council, and all of them unanimouſly agreed, it did no way contradict it: The Council of <hi>Nice</hi> declared thoſe Patriarchates, which Cuſtom had then ſetled, and (ſince after that time <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> came to be the Imperial City,) the ſecond General Council, and this at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> had as good right to declare <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> a Patriarchate, as the firſt at <hi>Nice</hi> had to declare others; and ſince Precedency was purely of Eccleſiaſtical Inſtitution, and given (as this Canon ſaith,) on conſideration of the honours of the Cities, when the Emperors had made this City equal to old <hi>Rome,</hi> as to the Civil State, the Council might allot it a ſuitable precedence in the Church, which was a perfecting of the Nicene Canon, and a
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:108925:161"/>
proceeding upon the ſame reaſon; but no contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to it. Secondly, <hi>Leo</hi> argues, that this was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the two Sees of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> which were elder Patriarchates, and ſo ought to preceed <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople:</hi> I reply, <hi>Maximus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> did not think this Canon any injury to him, for he is the ſecond who ſubſcribed it, and all-along in the ſeveral Seſſions <hi>Anatolius</hi> ſat and ſpoke before him: And though <hi>Leo</hi> ſtood nicely upon his points in theſe matters, we do not find other Biſhops were of that temper; they freely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Biſhop of the imperial City, eſpecially ſince he only had a place before them, but no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over any other Patriarch: So that <hi>Leo</hi> need not make any objections for them, who are not found to complain, or to have thought themſelves injured. I ſhall not inſiſt upon <hi>Leo</hi>'s inſinuation, that this Canon was procured fraudulently, and that <hi>Anatolius</hi> his Pride made him ſeek it, and ſtrive to impoſe upon the Council: For every body ſees the whole Council clears him of this; and 'tis plain, <hi>Leo</hi> was far prouder than <hi>Anatolius;</hi> he ſcorned a Second, and feared in time he might prove an Equal: But <hi>Anatolius</hi> only got that place confirmed to him in this Council, which he and his predeceſſors had hold long before: I might add here the elaborate Arguments of <hi>Baranius</hi> and <hi>Binius;</hi> but fearing I have been already too tedious, I ſhall refer the Reader to <hi>Richerius</hi> (who diſcovers all their Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies <note n="s" place="margin">
                              <hi>Richer.</hi> Hiſt. Concil. gen. Tom. 1. cap. 8. §. 44.</note>;) and make ſome obſervations on the reſt of theſe Letters after the Council. In an Epiſtle of the Emperors to the Monks of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who diſliked the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> he recommends its defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as agreeing to the Faith <hi>of</hi> Athanaſius, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus <hi>and</hi> Cyril, <hi>former Biſhops of</hi> Alexandria <note n="t" place="margin">Par. 3. num. 8. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 356 <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 849.</note>, which it ſeems was more conſiderable to them, than the Faith of <hi>Leo,</hi> in whom that Age knew of no Infallibility. Again, it is a good Rule in an Epiſtle of Leo's, <hi>That none ſhould ſeek his own advancement by the diminution of another</hi> 
                           <note n="u" place="margin">Ibid. num. 76. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 369. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 882.</note>, which had he and his Succeſſors obſerved they would not have degraded all the other Patriarchs
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:108925:162"/>
to ſet themſelves up as ſupreme over them all. There may be ſome ſuſpicion, whether that Epiſtle of <hi>Leo</hi> to <hi>Maximus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> be genuin; however there is a very improbable ſtory in it, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venalis</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had ſought to get the juriſdiction of all <hi>Paleſtina</hi> in the famous General Council of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi> and that <hi>Cyril</hi> had writ to <hi>Leo</hi> to joyn with him in oppoſing that deſign; whereas that Council of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus</hi> was held nine years before <hi>Leo</hi> was Pope <note n="w" place="margin">Ibid. num. 17. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 370. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 884.</note>; and therefore <hi>Leo</hi> could not be applied to, as to any thing agitated in that Council: After this follows a multitude of Epiſtles, in anſwer to the complaints of the Aegyptian Biſhops, who adhered to this Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and the Emperor <hi>Leo</hi>'s Order to all Biſhops, to give the Senſe of every Provincial Church, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this General Council which ſome heretical Monks had queſtioned: For this Emperor prudently avoided the charge and trouble of another General Council, appointing the Metropolitans to call their own Biſhops together at home, and to ſend him their Opinion of this Council of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> which was univerſally own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all in their ſeveral Letters, to have been an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Council, ſufficiently approved and confirmed: Now had the Pope then been infallible, or thought to be ſo, it had been ſufficient to write to him alone, and he could have told the Emperor the Senſe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church; but he was only writ to as other Biſhops were, to declare his own Opinion: So that in this proceeding there are no marks of his Supremacy; for the other Biſhops confirm the Faith decreed in this Council as well as the Pope, nor did his ratifying it make it needleſs for the Emperor to require the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of others.</p>
                        <p>§. 5. We have no more to add to this, but only to make a few brief Remarks upon ſuch paſſages in <hi>Binius</hi>'s Notes upon this Council, as have not yet come under our conſideration. The Miracle of <hi>Euphemia</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs taking the Orthodox Confeſſion of Faith into her

Hand (ſo long after her Death and Burial) and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away that which was Heretical, is only hinted at in that ſuſpicious Epiſtle from the Council <note n="x" place="margin">Par. 3. num. 2. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 351 <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 836.</note>: But the Notes and <hi>Baronius</hi> cite, for the formal ſtory, no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor elder than <hi>Metaphraſtes,</hi> who lived above 450 years after; and if we conſider how he and the later Writers, who mention it, vary and contradict one another in the time and manner of this pretended Miracle <note n="y" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Bin.</hi> not. P. 410. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 983.</note>, we ſhall eaſily diſcern the whole Story to be a Fiction. A little after the Notes ſay, that they <hi>highly injure this Holy Council, who ſay the Epiſtle of</hi> Ibas, <hi>which is Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, and contains the praiſes of Hereticks, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of the Orthodox, was received and approved by the Fathers at</hi> Chalcedon; <hi>for thoſe who ſay ſo joyn with the Nestorians</hi>

But alaſs it proves very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily, that it was Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> who ſaid this, and who was condemned for an Heretick for this and other things of like nature, by the fifth General Council <note n="a" place="margin">

Again, he tells us of one <hi>Julianus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Coos,</hi> that he was the Popes Legate <note n="b" place="margin">Not. <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 411. col. 2. <hi>Lab.</hi> ut ſupr.</note>, and ſo he is called indeed in the Subſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions ſometimes; but let it be noted, that the Pope doth not name this <hi>Julianus</hi> in his Letter to the Council among his Legates <note n="c" place="margin">Par. 1. num. 40. <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 31. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 70.</note>; but <hi>Paſchaſinus, Lucenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Boniface</hi> with one <hi>Baſilius</hi> are there ſaid to be his Legates: And yet this <hi>Baſilius</hi> never appeared in the Council, which makes a very Learned Man conjecture, that the Fathers at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> rejected two of thoſe whom the Pope had nominated for Legates, <hi>viz.</hi> this <hi>Baſilius</hi> and <hi>Julianus,</hi> the former not being admitted into the Council, and the later having no other place than what his own See gave him; ſo that <hi>Baronius</hi> his obſervation concerning this <hi>Julianus</hi> his ſpeaking La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, as the dignity of the Roman See required, will not prove him properly a Legate, or if it do <note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>Baron. An.</hi> 451. p. 143.</note>, then the Council placed the Popes Legates as they pleaſed. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Notes call the excommunicating of the Pope by <hi>Dioſcorus, ſcelus inauditum, an unheard-of-wickedneſs;</hi> and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:108925:163"/>
a little after they ſay, <hi>That</hi> Dioſcorus <hi>was the firſt that ever was known to excommunicate the Pope, or had committed this unheard-of-wickedneſs</hi>

For <hi>if the Council was ended,</hi> how came the whole Council to meet again without a new Summons, the very next day? Again, the Legates went out indeed, but it was after the Judges, not before them, as the Notes inſinuate; and the Judges went out becauſe the Cauſes were all heard, and only the Canons to be treated of; but before they went they ordered the Biſhops to make ſome Canons: So that to ſay the Council was ended, and the Synod diſſolved becauſe none but the Biſhops ſtaid, is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and contradicts his Note upon the third Seſſion, where he makes it a moſt clear evidence of a General Council, when the Biſhops meet without Lay Judges: If he ſay <hi>the Popes Legates did not ſtay;</hi> I reply, <hi>they were deſired to ſtay,</hi> and their peeviſh abſence could not hinder the Councils proceedings, no more than <hi>Dioſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> his abſenting; and the Acts were next day appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as good, though done without them; and there it was alſo proved, that the Council did not act clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinly; yea, it is very abſurd to ſay the going out of three Men from 627 who ſtaid behind, could make the Synod which remained, to be a Clandeſtine Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: So that we may wonder at the boldneſs of theſe Editors, who in ſpite to the <hi>28th</hi> Canon upon falſe grounds condemn thoſe Actions which were examined, juſtified and approved by this whole General Council.

But I ſee no reaſon to believe this Inſcription to be ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as the time of this <hi>Hilary (Leo</hi>'s Succeſſor <hi>An.</hi> 461.). For in his Letter extant in the Council, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the Story of his flight, but-mentions no Saint at all, only ſaith, <hi>he trusted in the grace of Chriſt</hi>

And this Style which is ſo like the Pagan Vows to their little Deities, was above the Infant Superſtition of that Age; ſo that beſides the improbability of an Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on continuing legible for near twelve hundred years; none who knows the time of <hi>Hilary</hi> can believe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints was ſo far advanced, for a Man to forget God and Jeſus Chriſt the only Deliverers of their Servants, and publickly, yea blaſphemouſly to aſcribe his deliverance to a Creature, <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 25. Wherefore we conclude this Inſcription was writ by ſome later Hand in times of groſs Idolatry and Ignorance; and that this which they call an <hi>Egregious Monument of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and an Argument for Invocation of Saints,</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but an Egregious Impoſture, and an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove the Fraud of thoſe who ſet up falſe Doctrines by feigned Antiquity. 'Tis true in the <hi>11th</hi> Action, when <hi>Stephen,</hi> whom <hi>Flavian</hi> had condemned in his life-time, was depoſed by the Council after his death, ſome of the Biſhops cried out, Flavian <hi>lives after his death, the Martyr hath prayed for us</hi>

D. <hi>Crakenth.</hi> in Spalat. <hi>c.</hi> 59. p. 383.</note>: Yet this (if it be genuine) is the greateſt ſtep toward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of Saints that I have ſeen in any Writing of this Age; though it be no more than a Flouriſh, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from an exceſs of Admiration of <hi>Flavianus,</hi> ſo lately martyred by <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> the Mortal Enemy of this Council, Concerning which <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> (for likeneſs

Now the wary Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts will not ſay theſe are <hi>Divine Honours,</hi> much leſs were they ſuch Honours, as were paid to any Saints in this Age, or ſome that followed: But when Modern Writers ſpeak of Ancient Times, they often ſpeak in Modern Phraſes; and ſo <hi>Binius</hi> took it to be the ſame thing to honour <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> as a Saint, and to give him Religious Worſhip, becauſe they at <hi>Rome</hi> now give Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip to thoſe they Canonize.</p>
                        <p>And this may ſuffice for this famous Council, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Leo</hi> (being all along Orthodox, while the Patriarchs of moſt other great Sees had been either faulty or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected) had the greateſt advantage imaginable to carry on his great Deſign of ſetting up for the Supremacy; and though by this accident, which he and his Legates improved, higher Titles are given him, than to any of his Predeceſſors or Succeſſors for ſome Ages in any Council; yet if the Forgeries and Corruptions be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Fallacious Notes well underſtood, there is no ground from any thing here ſaid or done, to think the Fathers at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> took this Pope for the ſole, ſupreme and viſible Head of the Catholick Church.</p>

No doubt to abuſe his Reader into a belief that Images were then in uſe.

Men may ſee great benefits are received by the interceſſion of Saints.</hi> But I ſhould rather think, he was blind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that could not diſcern theſe to be meer Fables; and truly the only Author he cites for them is <hi>Gregory Turonenſis,</hi> who lived 150 year after, and is full of theſe Fictions, contradicting even <hi>Salvian,</hi> who lived in that Country at this very time. But it is obſervable, that the Writers of the Lives of St. <hi>Lupus</hi> and <hi>Anianus</hi> (cited in this very place) do mention theſe Holy Men as <hi>praying only to God in theſe Calamities</hi> 
                              <note n="e" place="margin">Id. ibid. p. 135, 136, 137.</note>: For the direct invocation of Saints was not uſed, no not when thoſe Lives were written. Again, after the Council of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi> had been confirmed by the moſt Legal and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick ways, it is very ridiculous in this great Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt to cite ſo many frivolous Stories out of Legends, how ſome Ignorant and Enthuſiaſtical Monks confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, or were convinced by Miracles, that it was a Genuine and Orthodox Council <note n="f" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Baron.</hi> ibid. p. 160, 161, &amp;c.</note>: For he cites no better Author than <hi>Surius</hi> for theſe Fables, yet relates them with great confidence; but this Cauſe needs no ſuch evidence.</p>
                           <p>§. 2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We will note ſome paſſages in genuine Authors, which he hath corrupted to ſerve a turn: He that reads <hi>Baronius</hi> his Note in the year 402. <hi>that it was an Ancient Cuſtom to paint the Saints in the Churches, and that they uſe to worſhip them, with kindling Lamps before them</hi> 
                              <note n="g" place="margin">Baron. An. 402. <hi>p.</hi> 163.</note>, would imagine this Superſtition was ancient in the beginning of the Fifth Century; whereas the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor he cites for this is <hi>Venantius Fortunatus,</hi> who lived till the year 600. that is, 200 year after, and though he ſpeak of a Picture drawn on a Wall, and a Lamp beſide it, doth not mention that <hi>as any worſhip to the Picture,</hi> that is <hi>Baronius</hi>'s own addition. Again, when he cites a Law of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> prohibiting the Jews to burn any Croſs in contempt of Chriſtianity, he adds, <hi>that they burnt the Croſs together with our Saviour crucified on it</hi> 
                              <note n="h" place="margin">Baron. An. 408. <hi>p.</hi> 272.</note>; but that is his own invention; the cuſtom of making a Croſs alone being indeed very ancient,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:108925:169"/>
but the adding the Figure of our Saviour to it, which they call properly <hi>a Crucifix,</hi> is but a late device, and ſeems not at all to be referred to in that Law. To proceed, he makes <hi>Syneſius</hi> a notorious diſſembler, when he declares <hi>he had most ſolemnly proteſted to</hi> Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, <hi>who was to conſecrate him Biſhop of</hi> Prolemais, <hi>that he would not accept that Order, unleſs he might live with his Wife as before time</hi>

Now whoever reads that Letter may ſee that <hi>Syneſius</hi> profeſſes he tells truth in this relation; yea, he ſolemnly calls God and Men to witneſs, that it is true; he obſerves <hi>Truth is one of God's Attributes, and moſt pleaſing to him:</hi> Yet <hi>Baronius</hi> will have him to uſe the Art of Lying, in all theſe proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe forſooth he cannot think <hi>Theophilus</hi> would ordain a Biſhop, who ſhould live with, and have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by his Wife; that is, he meaſures the Primitive Church (in which there were divers Biſhops married) by their Modern Corrupt Roman Standard. And this ſincere Father muſt be made to mock God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Men, and expoſed as a Notorious Liar and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler, rather than there ſhould ſeem to be any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Primitive Church and theirs in the point of the Clergies Marriage. Again, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves out of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>

                              <note n="l" place="margin">Baron. An. 412. <hi>p.</hi> 336.</note>: But if St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> had not been miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, there had been no room for this fallacious Note. St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> blames this Council (in the ſecond place cited) as heretical for condemning <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and doth not mention Pope <hi>Julius</hi> there at all; and in the former place he names <hi>Athanaſius</hi> firſt, and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> only in the ſecond place; and he blames them not for condemning him as Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but becauſe he was Orthodox, as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was. Wherefore <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> leaves out the main part of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, only to bring in a falſe and flattering Inference for the Popes Supremacy. And I have obſerved before,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:108925:169"/>
he falſly gathers, that the Roman Church was the ſole Standard of Catholick Communion in <hi>Cecilian</hi>'s time, from a place where St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſaith, Cecilian <hi>of</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, <hi>was a Catholick, becauſe he was in Communion with the Roman Church, and other Lands from whence the Goſpel came into Africa</hi>

But <hi>Baronius</hi> is ſo dazled with <hi>Rome,</hi> that where that is found in any Sentence, he can ſee nothing elſe: And therefore when he cites this very place again a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he would prove <hi>that</hi> Carthage <hi>owned a right in the Roman Church to receive Appeals,</hi> and this, contrary to the expreſs Proteſtation of that African Council, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in St. <hi>Augustin</hi> was preſent; and the place it ſelf doth not mention any Appeals, and ſpeaks of Communion with other Churches as well as <hi>Rome</hi> 
                              <note n="n" place="margin">Baron. An. 419. <hi>p.</hi> 450.</note>; and ſo would equally prove a right in other Biſhops as well as the Pope, to receive Appeals from <hi>Africa,</hi> if that had been ſpoken of there. Further, from <hi>Socrates</hi> his relation of a Biſhop of <hi>Gyzicum,</hi> named by <hi>Siſinnius,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but not received, by reaſon of their miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a late Law made to confirm the Priviledges of that See of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and this in the time of a mild and quiet Biſhop; he infers, <hi>that this Patriarch challenged no right, no not in</hi> Holloſpont, <hi>by the Canon of any General Council</hi> 
                              <note n="o" place="margin">Baron. An. 426. <hi>p.</hi> 494.</note>. Now his naming a Biſhop for this City, ſhews he challenged a right, which was well known to be his due, both by the Canon of the ſecond General Council, and by this late Law; but a peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mans receding from his right, after he hath made his claim, rather than provoke a Factious City, is no proof there was no right, as <hi>Baronius</hi> doth pretend.

For it is well known, that a General Council in that Age gave Laws to the Pope, but did not receive any from him; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Leo</hi>'s Opinion might be, the Council were ſole Judges of the terms on which <hi>Eutyches</hi> was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored; and had he Recanted they would have received him into Communion by their own Authority, ſince <hi>Arius, Neſtorius</hi> and <hi>Pelagius</hi> had that Favour offered them by former Councils, and <hi>Eutyches</hi> would have found the like Kindneſs here, if the Pope had ſaid nothing at all of the matter: Wherefore the <hi>Annaliſt</hi> hath crouded many Falſhoods into a few Lines only, to perſuade his weak Readers, That the Pope was above a General Council.

                                 <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 402. pag. 156.</note>. For if we hear one Father when he had the Pope on his ſide in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Controverſie ſay this, This is not <hi>all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients:</hi> And many of them deſcribe themſelves, as being of the Faith of <hi>Athanaſius, Cyril, Flavianus, &amp;c.</hi> or holding the Faith of the Churches of <hi>Alexandria, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, Constantinople, &amp;c.</hi> to prove themſelves Catholick; and if S. <hi>Hierom</hi> did inſtance now in <hi>Rome,</hi> the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence depended on the Orthodoxneſs of the preſent Pope, not on the Infallibility of his See. And Pope <hi>Gelaſius</hi> afterward confeſſeth, That the Roman Church in this Point was guided intirely by S. <hi>Hierom, She thought as he thought</hi>

                              <note n="y" place="margin">Id. ibid. pag. 160.</note>. It had been well if their Roman Church had conſidered <hi>the peril of Idolatry,</hi> when they went about to eſtabliſh the uſe or <hi>Images,</hi> as <hi>Baronius</hi> tells us <hi>Theodoſius</hi> did, when he made a Law to prohibit <hi>any Adoration to be given to his own Statues, becauſe ſuch worſhip as exceeds the dignity of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

                              <note n="z" place="margin">Baron. An. 404. <hi>pag</hi> 187.</note>. Which Obſervations of his own ſtand on Record in theſe Annals, to condemn that Church which orders Veneration, and all other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Reverence to be made to all ſorts of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Saints. Again, he expoſes his dear Church in obſerving, <hi>That the Ancients preſerved both the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Elements of the Sacrament in the Church.</hi> But no ſooner had he condemned us for not following this ancient Uſage, but he mentions as great an Innovation in their own Church, for he owns they have forbid the preſerving any thing but the ſpecies of Bread <note n="a" place="margin">Baron. An. 404. <hi>pag</hi> 194.</note>. Now I would ask, Who differ moſt from Antiquity, they who totally take away one part of the Sacrament from the People, and keep only the Bread to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped: Or we who give both Bread and Wine to the People as they did, and provide both, newly Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, for the Sick, when there is occaſion, but reſerve neither for Worſhip? Which was the uſage of the firſt and pureſt times. And why may not we forbid the needleſs reſerving of the Sacrament in either kind, as well as they may prohibit it in one kind? But ſo inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is his deſire to extol the Roman Church, that though he cite all he can find of this ſort good and bad, <hi>he wiſhes</hi> (in one place) <hi>he could find ſome things, which are not to be found, that he might let his style run out on ſo luſcious a Subject</hi>

We note alſo, that how much ſoever the Romaniſts here in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Second were for Toleration, becauſe it was their Intereſt, <hi>Baronius</hi> highly commends the ſevere Penal Laws made by <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius</hi> againſt ſuch as differed from the eſtabliſhed way of Worſhip and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith <note n="c" place="margin">

To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, It is a very falſe conſequence from <hi>Cyril</hi>'s calling in <hi>Celeſtine</hi> to his aſſiſtance againſt <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and that Popes condemning the Heretick in his private Council at <hi>Rome, That it was the Ancient cuſtom from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for S.</hi> Peter's <hi>Chair alone to determine controverſies of Faith, and condemn Hereſies with their Authors as they ariſe</hi>

For <hi>Cyril</hi> had firſt condemned this Heretick and his Opinions, and the Pope only came in as his Second; yet after all it was neceſſary that a General Council ſhould condemn him, which had been needleſs if the Pope alone, or in conjunction with another Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch had been ſufficient. Again, he cites two Authors only for <hi>Celeſtine</hi>'s ſending a Pall and a Mitre to S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> and theſe Writers lived 8 or 900 year after this time, and he rejects ſome part of their account as fabulous; yet from this Evidence he would prove, <hi>That</hi> Cyril <hi>was</hi> Celeſtine'<hi>s Legate in the Council of</hi> Epheſus <note n="u" place="margin">Id. ibid. pag. 538.</note>: But he muſt have better proof than this to make us believe ſo incredible a thing.

An. 434. <hi>pag.</hi> 646, 647.</note>, manifeſtly ſhews the Innovation of the Roman Church, in that it declares they uſed then to dip the Bread in Wine, and thought it lawful to give the Cup to the Laity; whereas now they only give the people a dry Wafer. It was certainly a great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight in the <hi>Armenian</hi> Biſhops (according to him who makes the Pope the ſole Judge of Hereſie) to ſend to <hi>Proclus</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to know whether the Writings of <hi>Theodorus</hi> of <hi>Mopſveſtia</hi> were Orthodox or no? Yet <hi>Liberatus</hi> (an ancient Author) affirms they did this <hi>ſecundum morem, according to Cuſtom</hi> 
                              <note n="d" place="margin">Baron. An. 435. <hi>pag.</hi> 649.</note>. So that neither <hi>Liberatus</hi> nor the <hi>Armenians</hi> knew of any Cuſtom to go only to <hi>Rome,</hi> out of the Eaſt, to enquire concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true Faith; had they known this, no doubt they would have ſent a little further. Moreover, he highly extols the Piety of <hi>Florentius</hi> the <hi>Praetorian Praefect,</hi> who finding the Tax paid by the Curtezans of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to the Exchequer, hindred their expulſion from that City, gave Lands of his own to compenſate the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick damage, that he might get thoſe Infamous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men baniſhed <note n="e" place="margin">Baron.

for a little ſcandalous Penſion paid to their Treaſury at <hi>Rome.</hi> He alſo ſaith, It is a <hi>Pelagian</hi> Principle and Hereſie, to hold, That <hi>no Rich man can be ſaved, unleſs he give all his Eſtate to the Poor</hi>

It is manifeſt partiality alſo in him, to affirm it was a Judgment of God to deliver <hi>Carthage</hi> to the <hi>Vandals,</hi> becauſe there was Pagan Idolatry practiſed in that City <note n="g" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Baron.</hi> Tom VI. An. 440. pag. 5.</note>. But the ſame kind of Idolatry was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in <hi>Rome</hi> notwithſtanding all endeavours to root it out, till the <hi>Goths</hi> took it; but the <hi>Annaliſt</hi> doth not expound that Calamity after the ſame manner <note n="h" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 410.</note>. Thus he exclaims againſt the Cruelty of <hi>Genſericus</hi> the <hi>Vandal</hi> for perſecuting the Orthodox Biſhops upon the bare naming of <hi>Pharaoh, Nehuchadnezzar</hi> or <hi>Holofernes</hi> in their Sermons, pretending it was meant of him <note n="i" place="margin">Baron. An. 442. <hi>pag.</hi> 12.</note>. Whereas had he lived to this Age, he might have ſeen a King intituled, <hi>The moſt Chriſtian,</hi> inſtigated by the Jeſuits to perſecute the Reformed Paſtors for the ſame pretended Fault. It is remarkable that <hi>Theodoret,</hi> when he writes to a Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> proves himſelf Orthodox, becauſe his Faith was the ſame with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Biſhops of that See, <hi>viz.

An. 444. <hi>pag.</hi> 23.</note>. The Pope is not named, ſo that doubtleſs he was not the ſole Standard of Catholick Communion then; if he had, the name of one Pope had been more to <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s purpoſe than all theſe. Again, That Pope <hi>Leo</hi> writes as imperiouſly to <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as he uſe to do to others, is very true, but it no where appears that <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his Orders: Much leſs will it follow from hence, <hi>That</hi> Leo <hi>was the Master ſet over all Churches</hi> 
                              <note n="l" place="margin">Baron. An. 444. <hi>pag.</hi> 25.</note>; ſuch aſſuming of Empire over our Equals, may indeed ſhew our Ambition, but it will not prove our Right. It is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:108925:180"/>
obvious to all that read <hi>Baronius,</hi> how he ſtrains all things that are ſaid of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> to apply them to the Roman Church; but the Reader may note; how ſilently he paſſes it by, when our <hi>Gildas</hi> calls the Britiſh Biſhops Sees here in this Iſland, <hi>the Seats of</hi> Peter <note n="m" place="margin">Baron. An. 446. <hi>pag.</hi> 36.</note>. But this may ſatisfie all impartial Men, that the Ancients accounted other Biſhops <hi>the Succeſſors of S.</hi> Peter, as well as the Pope, though now he alone uſurps that and many other Priviledges, of Old enjoyed in common by others, as well as by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Again, he ſpoils the Old famous Story of the Converſion of <hi>Spain</hi> by S. <hi>James,</hi> wherein the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſo much pride them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, out of a zealous partiality for <hi>Rome,</hi> which inclines him to affirm, <hi>That</hi> Spain <hi>first received the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel from the Roman Church</hi> 
                              <note n="n" place="margin">Baron. An. 447. <hi>pag.</hi> 42.</note>: Which Notion may in time leſſen the Pilgrimaes to S. <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Compostella,</hi> and calls in queſtion the Devotion of thoſe many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, who have believed his Body to be there, and worſhip his Relicks in that place with great aſſurance. Soon after, upon occaſion of <hi>Turibius,</hi> complaining of the Apocryphal Books uſed by the <hi>Priſcillian</hi> Hereticks in <hi>Spain,</hi> the Cardinal ſhews the neceſſity of ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all Books that are againſt the Catholick Doctrin, and urges the Biſhop of <hi>Spain</hi> to ſuppreſs a Book writ by one <hi>John de Roa,</hi> about the Rights of Princes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Doctrins (as he ſaith) which he could not learn from the Jeſuits, Fryers or Clergy of <hi>Spain</hi> 
                              <note n="o" place="margin">Id. ibid. pag. 44.</note>. Now how many Books (as Apocryphal as thoſe of the old Hereticks, and as extravagant for the Rights of the Pope, as any that ever were writ on any Subject in the World) doth <hi>Baronius</hi> cite, approve and admire? But one Book that ſpeaks for the Prince, and the Civil Rights of Men, muſt by no means be endured. 'Tis obſervable alſo, That when <hi>Theodoret</hi> was ſuſpected of Hereſie, he appeals to a Council in which the Biſhops and Magiſtrates may meet, and the Judges may deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min what is conſonant to the Apoſtolical Doctrin <note n="p" place="margin">Baron. An. 448. <hi>pag.</hi> 53.</note>. Now if it had been known and believed then, that the Popes Communion was enough to make a man a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:108925:180"/>
Catholick, and he had been the ſole Judge, why did not <hi>Theodoret</hi> in one word appeal to the Pope, and ſay he was in Communion with <hi>Leo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome?</hi> He approves <hi>Theodoret's</hi> Cenſure of <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the Rights of other Dioceſes, contrary to the Canons of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and he blames <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> for his Pride and Ambition; but though the Pope labour to invade all Dioceſes, and make all the Biſhops in the World his Vaſſals, contrary to Law, Equity, and Primitive Uſage, this is no Crime in a Friend <note n="q" place="margin">Id. ibid. pag 54.</note>. <hi>Baronius</hi> is miſerably put to it about the Epiſtle of <hi>Ibas,</hi> judged (by two Councils) to be Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical; yet approved by the Infallible Chair. This makes him contradict himſelf ſtrangly; for here he ſaith, <hi>This was really</hi> Ibas <hi>his Epistle, as the Tenth Action at</hi> Chalcedon <hi>teaches, and himſelf confeſſed; and the Opinion of the Apoſtolick Legates of</hi> Maximus <hi>of</hi> Antioch <hi>and others confirm it, and</hi> Ibas <hi>was proved a Catholick by it</hi> 
                              <note n="r" place="margin">Baron. An. 448. <hi>pag.</hi> 67.</note>. But <hi>Baronius</hi> had before cited the Tenth Action at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> to prove, <hi>That this Epiſtle in that Council was found not to be</hi> Ibas <hi>Epistle, and ſo the Epistle was condemned, and he abſolved</hi> 
                              <note n="s" place="margin">Id. <hi>An.</hi> 432. pag. 626.</note>. And in the former place, as well as elſewhere <note n="t" place="margin">Id. Tom. 7. <hi>An.</hi> 553. Vid. <hi>Craken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp. Vigil. dormitans,</hi> cap. 10. p. 110.</note>, he affirms the Epiſtle contained Blaſphemy and Hereſie; yet Pope <hi>Vigilius</hi> approved it; and the Cardinal ſaith, <hi>Ibas</hi> was by this Epiſtle found to be a Catholick. He that can make theſe Contradictions friends, or reconcile them to the Infallibility,—<hi>erit mihi magnus Apollo.</hi> He commends Pope <hi>Leo</hi> for reproving <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror gently and mildly, when he was going to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Hereſie by a Pſeudo-Synod <note n="*" place="margin">In cujus manu eſt ut prohibeat, jubet agi, ſi non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibet admitti. <hi>Salvian.</hi>
                              </note>. Whereas Old <hi>Eli's</hi> Example may ſhew (if the Emperor was his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior in this matter, and the Pope his Ghoſtly Father) that his Reproof ought to have been ſharper; yea, he ſhould have expreſly prohibited the convening of this Council (if his Authority was neceſſary to their Meeting) and have not ſo meanly truckled as to ſend his Legates to a Synod, which he judged needleſs, yea, dangerous <note n="u" place="margin">Baron. An. 449 <hi>pag.</hi> 80.</note>. And if we conſider <hi>Leo's</hi> high Spirit,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:108925:181"/>
this Submiſſion ſhews, he had no right to call a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, nor power to hinder the Emperor from appointing one. Again, When the Pope (by <hi>Proſper's</hi> help) had writ a very ſeaſonable and Orthodox E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle againſt <hi>Eutyches,</hi> the French Biſhops were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to have it exactly Tranſcribed; but it follows not from hence, <hi>That they would not vary one ſyllable from his Decrees</hi> 
                              <note n="w" place="margin">Id. ibid. pag. 82.</note>. For this reſpect was ſhewed, not to the Authority of the See, but to the excellency of the Epiſtle, as appears in that the Gallican Biſhops (as hath been ſhewed) rejected other Decrees both of this Pope and his Predeceſſors, when they diſliked them. And <hi>Baronius</hi> owns a little after, that theſe Biſhops <hi>rejoyced that this Epiſtle contained their own ſenſe as to the Faith, and were glad that the Pope held the ſame Opinion, that they had always held from the Tradition of their Anceſtors</hi> 
                              <note n="x" place="margin">Id. ibid. pag. 86.</note>. So that this is no Proof, as he would have it, <hi>That the Pope was a Master preſiding over all the Chriſtian World.</hi> For they judged of his Teaching, and approved it, becauſe it agreed with their Churches ancient Tradition. On no better grounds he gathers, <hi>there was One only lawful Judge, One Governor of Holy things always in the Church,</hi> viz. <hi>the Pope;</hi> From <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret's</hi> Epiſtle to <hi>Leo</hi>

Thirdly, If this Epiſtle were genuine, it muſt be conſidered that all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, except the <hi>Roman,</hi> were at that time either corrupted or oppreſſed, and in that juncture <hi>Theodoret</hi> could appeal to none of them but <hi>Leo,</hi> and ſo might well give him good words, who alone was likely and able to aſſiſt him. As for that Teſtimony wherein they much glory, <hi>That</hi> Rome <hi>had the Supremacy over all Churches,</hi> (as their Tranſlation ſpeaks) <hi>becauſe it was always free from Hereſie, and no Heretick had ſat there</hi> 
                              <note n="a" place="margin">Id. <hi>Baron.</hi> ib. p. 102.</note>, it ſuppoſes a long experience of the Church of <hi>Romes</hi>
                              <pb n="155" facs="tcp:108925:181"/>
Integrity before this Priviledge was beſtowed; and if the Supremacy was given her for this Reaſon, ſhe ought to loſe it again whenever any Heretical Pope ſhall get the Chair; nor doth <hi>Theodoret</hi> at all ſuppoſe this impoſſible for the future. Moreover he brags, that <hi>Leo</hi> reſtored <hi>Theodoret</hi> and others, depoſed by this Pſeudo-<hi>Epheſine-</hi>Synod, and infers, <hi>That it was the Popes priviledge alone to reſtore Biſhops depoſed by a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> 
                              <note n="b" place="margin">Id. ibid. pag. 103.</note>. But the Misfortune is, <hi>Theodoret</hi> was called an Heretick after the Pope had privately acquitted him, and his Cauſe was to be tried over again at <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> and till that Council reſtored him he remained ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended for all this pretended Priviledge of the Pope. And before we leave him we may note, that he uſed all his Intereſt to perſuade the Emperor to call a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and impartial General Council, as appears by all his Epiſtles to his ſeveral Friends <note n="c" place="margin">Baron. An. 450. <hi>pag.</hi> 122, 123, 124.</note>; which ſhews he knew it was in the Emperor's power alone to call one; not in the Pope's, to whom he would have written, (being in favour with him) if he had had Authority in this Affair. He reckons <hi>Attila's</hi> leaving to harraſs the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Empire, to be a Divine Reward for <hi>Marcian's</hi> ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the true Religion there; but preſently tells us, That this Scourge of God, and other ſad Judgments fell upon <hi>Italy</hi> and the Weſtern Empire; from whence he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the Reformation of all Eaſtern Hereſies came, and where he believes no Hereſie could ever take place <note n="d" place="margin">Baron. An. 450. <hi>pag.</hi> 125.</note>. So miſerably do Men expoſe themſelves, when they pretend to give Reaſons for all God's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations. In the next year hapned the Famous Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> wherein divers of <hi>Baronius's</hi> Frauds have been already detected; ſo that I am only to add, That <hi>Leo</hi> was politick in pretending to give <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolius</hi> a power to receive Recanting Biſhops, who had fallen into <hi>Eutyches</hi> Hereſie, and cunningly reſerves the greater Caſes to his own See <note n="e" place="margin">Baron. An. 451. <hi>p. 128, &amp;</hi> 130.</note>. But 'tis plain, <hi>Anatolius</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had as much power in the Provinces ſubject to him, as the Pope had in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the greater Caſes were, according to ancient Uſage,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:108925:182"/>
reſerved to the next General Council, where both the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinoples</hi> Acts were to be re-examined, and none of theſe Erring Biſhops were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored but by that Council. And finally, he makes it a great Crime in <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> to pretend to Lord it over <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to ſay, He had as much Authority there as the Emperor <note n="f" place="margin">Id. ibid. pag. 144.</note>. Yet the following Popes did and ſaid as much in relation to <hi>Italy;</hi> but <hi>Baronius</hi> cannot ſee any harm in that, though <hi>Socrates</hi> did, who ſaith, <hi>That both the Biſhops of</hi> Rome <hi>and</hi> Alexandria <hi>had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the bounds of Prieſtly-power, and fallen to a ſecular way of Ruling</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>4th</hi> Canon of this Council is corrupted by <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and <hi>Baronius.</hi> For where the Text reads, <hi>If any be</hi> [coelibes] <hi>unmarried,</hi> they put into the Margen as a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reading, <hi>if any be</hi> [debiles] <hi>weak:</hi> Which is to make the Reader believe, that all the Clergy then were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married; whereas this Canon ſuppoſes many of them had Wives.

                        <p>The Council of 73 Biſhops at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was <note place="margin">An.

§. 2. Pope <hi>Hilary</hi> (who ſucceeded <hi>Leo)</hi> might juſtly <note place="margin">An. Dom. 461.</note> be ſuſpected of Hereſie, becauſe he confirms no more than three General Councils, omitting that of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> which condemned <hi>Macedonius.</hi> But ſince there is no evidence of this Univerſal Epiſtle confirming the other three Councils, but only the fabulous Pontifical, we may acquit him, and perhaps even in the very Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical, this Council may have been eraſed after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie of the Primacy was ſtarted <note n="l" place="margin">Vita <hi>Hilar. Bin.</hi> pag. 424. <hi>Lab.</hi> Col. 1029.</note>. However, this being owned all along by the Catholick Church for a General Council, it can ſuffer nothing by the Popes not confirming it; he alone would deſerve cenſure for not ſubſcribing to it.</p>
                        <p>The Spaniſh Biſhops who write to this Pope, by their Countries being waſted by <hi>Euaricus</hi> the Goth <note n="m" place="margin">Baron. An. 464. <hi>n.</hi>
                           </note> were deſtitute of Power, and deſire <hi>Hilary</hi> to declare the Canons in ſome particular Caſes, hoping the perſons concerned (who deſpiſed them in their low eſtate,) might have more reſpect for a great Patriarch <note n="n" place="margin">

So that it is very Sophiſtical in the Annaliſt and <hi>Binius,</hi> to draw conſequences from hence, for the Popes being the Supream Judge, and having power to diſpenſe with all Canons. The Pope himſelf in his Anſwer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends no ſuch thing <note n="o" place="margin">

                        <p>But the third Epiſtle of <hi>Hilary,</hi> writ about the ſame affair, ſeems to diſcover, that all theſe Epiſtles (which talk ſo big of the Popes Supremacy) are counterfeit: For the Forger, weary of inventing new Phraſes, ſteals the beginning <hi>verbatim</hi> out of thoſe Epiſtles, that are falſly aſcribed to <hi>Zepherine</hi> and <hi>Fabian,</hi> and were not extant until long after Pope <hi>Hilary's</hi> death <note n="p" place="margin">

The Notes on the <hi>4th</hi> Epiſtle own, that the Popes may be cajoled by falſe Stories, and deceived in Matter of Fact; and this ſo far as to condemn holier Biſhops than themſelves, as <hi>Leo</hi> and this <hi>Hilary</hi> did, in the caſes of <hi>Hilary</hi> of <hi>Arles,</hi> and <hi>Mammertus</hi> of <hi>Vienne</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>5th</hi> Epiſtle was writ three year before thoſe that precede it, and the Humility of the Style makes me think it the only genuine Letter (as yet ſet down) of this Pope; for he writes to the Biſhop of <hi>Arles</hi> (not as a Son, but) as a Brother, and takes it well that he adviſed him to keep cloſe to the Ancient Canons.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>9th</hi> Epiſtle ſhews, that <hi>Mammertus</hi> his Piety was no protection to him, againſt the injuries of the Roman Court <note n="r" place="margin">

                        <p>There is but one Roman Council under this Pope, called (as is pretended) to confirm his falſe Judgment about the Spaniſh Biſhops; for they abſolve the guilty <hi>Sylvanus,</hi> and condemn <hi>Irenaeus</hi> who was innocent: And though this Popes being commonly in the wrong makes it probable, he might get ſuch a Council toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet the very Acts ſmell ſtrong of Forgery, as well as the former Epiſtles in theſe caſes <note n="t" place="margin">Concil.

in Pope <hi>Gelaſius</hi> Opinion, the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is guilty of a grand Sacriledge, in taking the Cup from the People: And it ſeems, the Editors thought <hi>Baronius</hi> had not ſufficiently ſatisfied this Objection, and therefore they cunningly leave it out of this Popes Decrees <note n="e" place="margin">

                        <p>It is a trifling Note on this Epiſtle, <hi>That</hi> Gelaſius <hi>admoniſhed ſome Biſhops of</hi> Italy <hi>againſt Pelagianiſm, not fearing two Princes, one of which was an Eutychian, the other an Arrian Heretick</hi>

And no wonder, ſince that Age, as well as this, knew his pretences were unjuſt, his reaſoning fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious, and his inſtances falſe.

Fourthly, He affirms, that the care of all the Churches about <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was given to <hi>Acacius</hi> by the Apoſtolick See: Which is, (as hath been proved) a notorious Falſhood; of which this Epiſtle is ſo full, that one would ſuſpect it was the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of a much later Age.

So that the Impartial Reader may judge what credit is to be given to this Epiſtle (out of which they often prove their Supremacy) written by a bigotted Pope (who ſcrupled not at any thing to advance his See) if it be genuine, and tranſcribed by ſuch as are convicted of repeated Corruptions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Labbè</hi> gives us two other imperfect Epiſtles of <hi>Gela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> about his renouncing Communion with thoſe who kept <hi>Acacius</hi> his Name in their Dypticks, as moſt of the Eaſtern Biſhops then did <note n="n" place="margin">Gelaſ. <hi>ep.</hi> 14 &amp; 15. <hi>Lab. col.</hi> 1212.</note>.

But all their outcry is againſt <hi>Acacius,</hi> whom they would never forgive living nor dead, for touching their Juriſdiction, that was dearer to them than all the Articles of their Creed. But while they hated him, the whole Eaſtern Church took his part, and he continued to exerciſe his Office (in ſpight of all the Popes Sentences) until his death, leaving behind him ſo good a Character, that <hi>Suidas</hi> ſaith, <hi>If ever any man were truly venerable it was Acacius</hi>

Yea, it was a long time before the Greeks could be perſuaded either by the promiſes or threatnings of <hi>Rome</hi> to put his Name out of the Dypticks, though the union of the Eaſt and Weſt depended at laſt upon that ſingle Point: They objected, that he ſubſcribed the Edict for Union made by <hi>Zeno.</hi> I reply, ſo did three Patriarchs more, and that Edict contained no Hereſie, nor did it condemn the Council of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> They urge alſo, <hi>that he rejected</hi> John Talaia <hi>an Orthodox Biſhop of Alexandria:</hi> But that was becauſe he believed him perjured, and conſequently unduly elected.

Nor is it any wonder that one Pope ſhould approve what his Predeceſſors had condemned; and if this be true, <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſius</hi> judged better than former Popes, whoſe Eyes were dazeled ſo by Ambition, that they could not ſee the Truth. <hi>2ly,</hi> As to his communicating with <hi>Photinus</hi> without a Council, the Notes finally do not deny it; and it ſeems <hi>Foelix</hi> the Senator doubted not (if <hi>Anaſtaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> had lived) to have engaged him to ſubſcribe <hi>Zeno</hi>'s Edict for Union; ſo that he was likely enough to be moderate toward <hi>Acacius</hi> his party: Only I do not think he would (as the Notes pretend) venture upon his ſingle Authority to abſolve <hi>Photinus,</hi> if he had been condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a Council, becauſe in that Age the Popes did not exerciſe any ſuch power. <hi>3dly,</hi> As to his being ſtrook with death by voiding his Bowels, it might be true; nor can I think (as the Notes ſuggeſt) that all the Authors above cited are miſtaken, and put the Pope for the Emperor, who died by Thunder, becauſe the Deaths were very different: And though <hi>Binius</hi> ſay it was <hi>about the ſame time</hi>

So that thoſe Hiſtorians muſt be very dull who could not diſtinguiſh two ſuch different things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to two Perſons at ſo great a diſtance of time and place, but took it for the ſame ſtory: Yet after all it may be this Pope died a natural death, and that this ſlander of his dying by Gods Judgment might be the invention of the next Age, after the Popes had got <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> to be declared a Schiſmatick; for then the Writers were to blacken all his Friends by ſuch Fables as theſe. And now that turn is ſerved, <hi>Baronius</hi> would wipe off the ſtain again, meerly becauſe <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> was a Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> How probable this gueſs is, I leave the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to judge.</p>
                        <p>There is but one Epiſtle of this Pope, writ to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror (his Name-ſake) <hi>Anastaſius,</hi> wherein 'tis plain, he thinks the Quarrel about <hi>Acacius</hi> now deceaſed, no juſt ground for the two Churches to ſeparate from each other <note n="s" place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>Anaſt.

But impartial Readers will ſee, that his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is better confirmed by Reaſon and Scripture, than the contrary ever was by any Pope that held it: Nor ought the Notes to ſay, <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> decreed this by a diſpenſation grounded on his Apoſtolical Authority For it is an Orthodox Truth, <hi>That the Crimes of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers of Sacraments and Holy Orders, eſpecially if it be only Schiſm, do not invalidate them, to ſuch as in their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity receive them:</hi> So that unleſs a Pope need a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to tell Truth, here is no occaſion for any diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Power.</p>
                        <p>This Epiſtle is followed by a Memorial given by the Legates of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to the Popes Legates then at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> for an Union between the two Churches <note n="w" place="margin">Memor. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 508. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 1283.</note>, which they ſpeak of as equal Siſter Churches, and give

no hint of any ſubjection due from them to <hi>Rome,</hi> (which they think) had unfortunately miſtaken them, as guilty of Hereſie: Nor doth <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> in the former Letter to the Emperor pretend to any power that he had over <hi>Alexandria,</hi> but deſires the Emperor by his Wiſdom and Authority to reduce them to the Catholic Faith, calling him <hi>the Vicar appointed by God to preſide in the Earth:</hi> Which the modern Roman Writers think too great a complement to a Lay Prince.</p>

in which Sentence if the Emperor wilfully involved himſelf, they (who had done nothing againſt him) could not juſtly be blamed, as if they had Excommunicated him: Now to bring in this Sentence with <hi>iſta quidem Ego</hi>—is to make the Pope contradict himſelf, and confeſs he had Excommunicated the Emperor, which he utterly denies, and therefore <hi>ista quidem Nego</hi>—muſt be the true Reading, and that bold Forgery of turning it into <hi>[Ego,]</hi> was made on purpoſe to ſet up an early Precedent for the Pope's having Excommunicated Emperors.

It is very improbable, that later Authors ſhould know ſo exactly all the little Acts, Sayings and Miracles of St. <hi>Benedict,</hi> and yet differ almoſt 30 year about the year of his Birth; nor are they agreed about his Age and Death.

                           <p>§. 2.

Whereas this Edict clearly confirms the Canon of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> which had given the ſecond place to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> by this very Emperor <hi>Marcian</hi>'s conſent: And it is ſomething odd, that our Annaliſt by meer fancy, ſhould aſſert even with confidence, than an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of the Eaſt ſhould revoke by an Edict, and a Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> renounce a Priviledge granted by that ſame Emperor, and in a General Council, to that Church, a few years before.</p>

Thus upon Suppoſition that the Pope was then above the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and that nothing relating to the Church could be done without the Roman Biſhop; He introduces an Edict of <hi>Marcian</hi>'s, with a Letter of Pope <hi>Leo</hi>'s, and with this Phraſe, <hi>The Emperor</hi> Marcian <hi>obeyed Pope Leo</hi>

                           <p>He ſuppoſes <hi>Acacius</hi> was the Enditer of an Edict of <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperor, touching the Priviledges of the See of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and then harangues upon his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and ſeverely taxeth his Pride <note n="e" place="margin">

But he brings no proof but his own conjecture, that <hi>Acaoius</hi> did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure this Edict: Yet if he did, it only confirms the ancient Priviledges of that See, and thoſe it was then in poſſeſſion of; and if this make him appear proud as <hi>Lucifer</hi> (as the Cardinal intimates:) How many Edicts with ten times loftier Stiles have the Popes procured or forged, to ſet up and ſupport their Supremacy? Yet we find no cenſures of them, nor no inferences, but in their commendation.</p>
                           <p>It is a falſe ſuppoſition, that <hi>Acacius</hi> was ſtirred up by the Letters of Pope <hi>Simplicius</hi> to oppoſe the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical attempts of the Uſurper <hi>Baſiliſcus:</hi> For (as we have proved before,) <hi>Simplicius</hi> flattered this Tyrant, at the ſame time when <hi>Acacius</hi> moved by his own Zeal for the Catholick Faith, oppoſed him <note n="f" place="margin">

But it is the Cardinals deſign, to make all good Deeds owe their original only to the Popes, and to blacken all that <hi>Acacius</hi> did, becauſe he would not truckle to the Papal Chair: Otherwiſe, when <hi>Baſiliſcus</hi> doth no more but reſtore the Rights that <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had before his time, (as the words of the Edict ſhew <note n="g" place="margin">Id. ibid. n. 64.</note>; and <hi>Theodorus Lector</hi> affirms nothing, but that the Rights of that See were reſtored; why ſhould it be a Crime in <hi>Acacius</hi> to procure this Confirmation from <hi>Baſiliſcus?</hi> I dare ſay, <hi>Baronius</hi> thinks it no fault in <hi>Boniface,</hi> to get the Primacy of <hi>Rome</hi> eſtabliſhed by <hi>Phocas,</hi> a Bloodier Tyrant and greater Uſurper than <hi>Baſiliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</hi>

                           <p>A little after, upon the bare Affirmation of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted and partial Pope, he ſaith, Acacius <hi>governed the Eaſtern Provinces by a power delegated from the Pope</hi>

                                 <hi>Baron. An.</hi> 477 n. 13. pag. 334.</note>; and upon this ſuppoſition he explains the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:108925:204"/>
lapſed Aſian Biſhops Supplication to him, as if it was on the account of his being the Popes Legate: But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be falſer; for if <hi>Acacius</hi> would have ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſuch a Delagation, the Popes and he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fallen out; ſo that nothing is more certain, than that he ever deſpiſed ſuch a delegated power, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed juriſdiction over thoſe Aſian Biſhops by an Authority granted him by Councils and Imperial reſcripts, That is, by as good right as the Pope had in <hi>Italy.</hi>

                           <p>Another falſe ſuppoſition is, that <hi>Timothy</hi> the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſent the Petition of ſuch as had fallen in the time of his heretical Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, to <hi>Rome</hi> to beg Pardon, and to deſire they might be readmitted into the Church; and thence he infers, <hi>That the abſolution from the crime of Hereſie, was wont to be reſerved to the Pope</hi>

                                 <hi>Baron. An.</hi> 478. n. 15, 16. pag 342.</note>. A Note ſo falſe and abſurd, that we muſt ſuppoſe thoſe Millions of Hereticks, which on their repentance were abſolved all the World over, in all Ages, without conſulting the Pope; were not rightly abſolved, if this were True: But he builds it on a Rotten Foundation; The Letter of <hi>Simplicius,</hi> (whence he deduces it) ſaying no more, but that this <hi>Timothy</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> had ſent him a Copy of this Petition, to ſhew upon what terms he had readmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to the Communion of the Church; and the Pope thought his proceedings were unexceptionable: But there is not a word of their deſiring a Pardon from <hi>Rome,</hi> or of the Popes granting it; much leſs of that Patriarchal Church of <hi>Alexandria's</hi> wanting power to reconcile its own Members; which was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on it by the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> as amply as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Churches was.</p>
                           <p>Soon after he ſuppoſes, no Election of a Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> or <hi>Antioch</hi> was good and valid, unleſs it were confirmed by the Pope: Now he draws this conſequence from a Letter of <hi>Simplicius,</hi> which only ſays, <hi>that upon</hi> Zeno <hi>the Emperors charging</hi> John Talaia <hi>the elect Biſhop of</hi> Alexandria <hi>with Perjury,</hi> (who had
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:108925:205"/>

Which confirming, ſignifies no more than the Popes giving him Communicatory Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as to an Orthodox Biſhop; which was requiſite for every Patriarch to grant to any New-Elected Patriarch as well as the Pope: And that it ſignifies no more is plain from hence, becauſe though afterwards this <hi>John</hi>'s election was approved at <hi>Rome;</hi> yet that confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation did not make him Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> So that a Papal confirmation in thoſe days gave no Biſhop a Title, and was no more but a Teſtimonial of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with him at <hi>Rome,</hi> and judging him Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox: And <hi>John Talaia</hi> deſired ſuch a Confirmation as this from <hi>Acacius</hi> as well as from the Pope, as <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beratus</hi> affirms <note n="l" place="margin">Id. ibid n 23. pag 359.</note>; and the miſcarriage of thoſe Letters, it ſeems was one reaſon why <hi>Acacius</hi> oppoſed his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                           <p>He reckons up a great many things (in his opinion) grievous Crimes done by <hi>Zeno</hi> the Emperor, <hi>but that</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which is more odious than all the monſtrous wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes is, that an Emperor ſhould establiſh a Decree about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith</hi>

Now this is all on ſuppoſition, that Princes are not to meddle in the ſetling the True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: But if he look into Sacred or Eccleſiaſtical Story, he ſhall find nothing hath been more uſual, than for the moſt Religious Princes to confirm the true, and condemn falſe Religions; and therefore if this <hi>Uniting Edict of</hi> Zeno <hi>were Orthodox (of which we do not now diſpute) the making it was no Crime as all.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The next Year, he repeats the Story of <hi>John Talaia</hi> his appealing to the Pope; and becauſe in this Age they have made him the Supreme Judge over the whole Church, <hi>Baronius</hi> ſaith <hi>he appealed to him as to the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Judge</hi>

But <hi>Liberatus,</hi> out of whom he hath the Story, ſhews he applyed to the Pope only as an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, and perſuaded him to write to <hi>Acacius</hi> in his behalf: And indeed the Popes definitive Sentence in thoſe days, would have done him no good: Wherefore,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:108925:205"/>
he only deſired he would uſe his intereſt in <hi>Acacius,</hi> to reconcile him to the Emperor; but all in vain: Which ſhews that the Eaſtern Church did not then believe the Pope was a lawful Judge in this Caſe. It is a bold ſtroke, under ſuch a Pope as <hi>Simplicius</hi> (who ſubmitted to the Eaſtern Emperors, who (in <hi>Baronius</hi> Opinion) were Schiſmaticks, and to the Arrian Gothic Kings in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> and who could purge his own City from Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, but connived at the Arrians who poſſeſſed neer half <hi>Rome);</hi> for the Hiſtorian to brag, <hi>that the Popes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Authority ſhined as bright as under</hi> Conſtantine, <hi>or</hi> Theodoſius <note n="o" place="margin">

                           <p>From this immoderate conceit of the Papal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in that Age, proceeds that miſtaken obſervation, That Pope <hi>Foelix</hi> and <hi>Gelaſius</hi> rejecting the Books of <hi>Fauſtus Rhegienſis,</hi> was <hi>more than all the pious and learned Writings of S.</hi> Caeſarius, <hi>S.</hi> Avitus <hi>and the famous</hi> Fulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, <hi>who in peculiar Tracts confuted</hi> Fauſtus <note n="p" place="margin">

Whereas, it is the Annaliſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices that put him into this Miſt: The Catholicks of the Eaſt cleerly ſaw their great Patriarch was truly Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, and knew no ſuch Principle as the Cardinal dreams of: Wherefore they did not think an Orthodox Biſhop leſs Orthodox, becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> rejected him for not ſubmitting to their Uſurpations.

                           <p>Of this we have a further proof in the next Year, when <hi>Elias</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (owned by <hi>Baronius</hi> for a good Catholick <note n="r" place="margin">Baron.

                           <p>It is obſervable, that thoſe which he calls <hi>the most faithful Acts of</hi> Daniel Stylites (and would have this Saint paſs for a Prophet) relate, that after a great Fire was begun in the City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to quench it proved vain; they went to <hi>Daniel</hi> to pray for them, who foretold them, that <hi>the Fire ſhould ceaſe after ſeven days,</hi> and ſo it came to paſs <note n="e" place="margin">Baron.

                           <p>How often doth our Annaliſt cenſure the Eaſtern Emperors and Patriarchs, for tolerating Hereticks? How many dreadful Judgments (in his way of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting Providence) doth he note, came upon them for this ſingle Crime? Yet here we have an Heretical Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror tolerated all his Reign for 17 year together, and his name allowed in the Dypticks, by many Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Popes, for near 30 year after his death <note n="s" place="margin">Baron. An. 491. <hi>n. 4. pag.</hi> 455.</note>. Surely he will not own ſo many Infallible Guides, before <hi>Hormiſda,</hi> were ignorant of <hi>Zeno's</hi> Hereſie; and if they did know it, their fault in tolerating him, and owning his Memory is much greater: How much ſo ever, therefore he would magnifie his Roman Biſhops care of the Catholick Faith, when Truth comes out, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Constantinople</hi> in this Age did more Service to the Faith, than the Popes; and <hi>Euphemius</hi> threatned <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastaſius</hi> the Emperor into profeſſing the right Faith while <hi>Foelix</hi> flattered him <note n="t" place="margin">Id.

                           <p>He gives it us, as an ingenious Argument of Pope <hi>Gelaſius, That the cauſe between him and</hi> Acacius <hi>could not be judged at</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>where the ſame perſons were Enemies, Witneſſes and Judges</hi>

As for his other aſſertion, no Father of credit can be produced, that did appropriate Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, or Confeſſorſhip to thoſe in Communion with <hi>Rome:</hi> Yea, this very Age produced a great many Biſhops and holy Monks, ſuch as <hi>Elias, Daniel Stylites,</hi> St. <hi>Sabas, &amp;c.</hi> who did not communicate with the Pope, but took part (in this conteſt) with <hi>Euphemius,</hi> who then were and ſtill are (even by <hi>Baronius)</hi> called Martyrs and Conſeſſors.

                           <p>In like manner he uſes <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> a learned and pious Roman Deacon, who never ſeparated from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church; but when two ambitious Candidates,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:108925:209"/>
ſcandalouſly ſtrove for the Papal Chair, he chanced to take the leſs fortunate ſide: And this he counts <hi>dying in Schiſm,</hi> and (without any Authority) takes it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he repented of it before his death, becauſe otherwiſe he thinks it was impoſſible he ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <note n="b" place="margin">Baron.

The ground of theſe remarks is an idle Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend, out of the fabulous Dialogues aſcribed to St. <hi>Gregory:</hi> But the Principles (of making it Schiſm and a mortal Sin to miſtake in a Popes Election) are his own.</p>
                           <p>To conclude this ſort of obſervations, it is very hard that <hi>Symmachus ſhould long expect Letters from</hi> Anaſtaſius <hi>the Emperour, more majorum</hi>

                           <p>There are many of theſe digreſſions about <hi>Acacius,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> againſt whom he moſt bitterly inveighs for a long time together; and treats him with language ſo rude and ſcurrilous, that one would think he was ſome Monſter or Devil incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <note n="d" place="margin">Baron.

                           <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 525. col. 2. <hi>Lab.</hi> 1332.</note>. The firſt Law was, <hi>That no Pope ſhould be elected, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the King of</hi> Italy <hi>(then Lord of</hi> Rome.) The other, <hi>That no Pope, Biſhop or other Clergy-man ſhould alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate things given to the Church.</hi> Which Laws they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to annul, becauſe they were both made by Lay-men, and not ſubſcribed by any Pope. But firſt, It is certain that Lay Princes made many Laws in Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Affairs, by Advice of their Clergy; and theſe were frequently confirmed in Synods. Secondly, Theſe Laws were made in a Council of the Clergy, as appears by that Title <hi>Sanctitati veſtrae,</hi> uſed by <hi>Baſilius;</hi> and <hi>Eulalius</hi> in this Council confeſſes theſe Laws were made, <hi>ſome Biſhops conſenting to them</hi>

                           <hi>Bin.</hi> p. 526. col. 2. <hi>Lab.</hi> 1336.</note>. Moreover, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Pope had directed the making theſe Laws. And the Annotator (who here objects, They were made in the Vacancy of the See), in another place ſaith, <hi>The Roman Clergy well knew, that when the Pope, the viſible Head of the Church, was taken away, it was their part, by ancient Custom (as the neareſt Members to the Head, and Adminiſtrators of</hi> Peter'<hi>s Church) to take care of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church</hi>

                        </note>. Wherefore he cannot fairly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but the Roman Clergy had power in the Vacancy, to confirm a Law relating to the good ordering of their
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:108925:215"/>
own Church: And the bloody Conteſt (not yet appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) occaſioned by a double election which was lately ſubmitted to be judged by <hi>Theodoric,</hi> makes it very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable this Law ſhould be repealed now, when ſo freſh an inſtance convinced them, that their Schiſms would be endleſs and intolerable if Princes did not interpoſe. And <hi>Symmachus</hi> muſt be an ill man when he got the Chair purely by <hi>Theodoric</hi>'s approbation, to kick down the ſtep upon which he was raiſed, and to take away his right to confirm, by whom his doubtful: Title was confirmed. And finally, neither this <hi>Theodoric</hi> nor his Succeſſors, did ever take any notice of this Repeal, but in every vacancy did interpoſe. So that I take this Synod to be a Fiction to cover over the Power that a Lay Prince here exerciſed in making a Pope, or if there ever were ſuch a Synod it was deſpiſed, and the Law was in force after this aſſembly had revoked it. And thus all <hi>Baronius</hi> his Oratory about <hi>Symmachus</hi> his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and exalting himſelf above Kings and Princes <note n="s" place="margin">
                           <hi>Baron. An.</hi> 502. n. 29. pag. 546.</note> vaniſhes into air, and is as falſe as this Popes excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> the Emperor in this Synod; which is only proved by a corrupt reading of <hi>(ego)</hi> for <hi>(nego)</hi> as I ſhewed before.</p>
                     <p>For the other Law to forbid alienations, they pretend to repeal it meerly becauſe it was made by Lay-men (which is falſe); But the Clergy here reeſtabliſh it. If the Acts were genuine, I ſhould gueſs this was to put it in the Clergies power to diſpenſe with themſelves and their Canon, whenever they had a mind to be ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious: Since while a Royal Law forbad it, a Royal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence muſt be firſt obtained, which would be hard to procure. But the power of <hi>Theodoric</hi> and <hi>Symmachus</hi> his circumſtances then, make it clear he durſt not repeal a Law of the Prince. So that it ſeems to be forged. Wherefore I will make but two remarks more, Firſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Sentence in the Acts <hi>Quia non licuit Laico sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuendi in Eccleſiâ (praeter Papam Romanum) habere aliquam Poteſtatem</hi>

the Pope a Lay-man, and is too ridiculous to be ſpoken by <hi>Laurentius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Milan.</hi> Secondly, on the Notes I remark, that it is very ſtrange this Synod ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> for communicating with Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks ſuppoſed, ſince the former Synod complements <hi>Theodoric</hi> à profeſſed Arrian (the worſt of Hereticks) with the Titles of <hi>most pious and moſt holy</hi>

                     <p>After this Council is added an Apology writ (to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a Paper (now ſuppreſſed) againſt <hi>Symmachus)</hi> by <hi>Ennodius,</hi> wherein as far as appears by the Objections he cites, and the Anſwers he gives, the Accuſers of this Pope were too hard for his Apologiſt.

The Sixth Roman Council hath no date; but the Subſcriptions are certainly forged, having (like the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) the names of many Eaſtern Biſhops who could not be in this Synod. The Acts are a Rhapſody out of ſome later Councils againſt Sacriledge <note n="h" place="margin">

                     <p>§. 2. There were few Councils abroad in this Popes time, and he was not concerned in them. The Council <note place="margin">An. Dom 506.</note> of <hi>Agatha</hi> (now <hi>Agde)</hi> in the Province of <hi>Narbon,</hi> was called by the conſent of <hi>Alaricus</hi> an Arrian King; <hi>Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arles</hi> was Preſident of it, and divers good Canons were made in it <note n="m" place="margin">

I ſhall make no particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark but on the Ninth Canon, where <hi>Caeſarius</hi> (who was much devoted to promote that Celibacy of the Clergy which now was practiſed at <hi>Rome)</hi> and the Council declare <hi>that the orders of</hi> Innocent <hi>and</hi> Siricius <hi>ſhould be obſerved</hi>

From whence we may Note, that theſe Orders had not yet been generally obeyed in <hi>France,</hi> and that a Popes Decretal was of no force there by vertue of the Authority of his See, but became obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory by the Gallican Churches acceptance, and by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into a Canon in ſome Council of their own. But that the uſages of <hi>Rome</hi> did not preſcribe to <hi>France</hi> is plain from the Notes on the xii Canon, where it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears their Lent Faſt was a total abſtinence till evening, none but the infirm being permitted to dine <note n="o" place="margin">Not. in Con. xii. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 560. col. 1. <hi>Lab.</hi> 1398.</note>. But the Roman Lent (unleſs they have altered their old rule) allows men to dine in Lent with variety of ſome ſorts of meat and drink, which is not ſo ſtrict by much as this Gallican cuſtom.</p>

The Biſhops were ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Precept of King <hi>Clovis,</hi> who alſo gave them the heads of thoſe things they were to treat of. And when their Canons were drawn up, they ſent them (not to <hi>Rome,</hi> but) to their King for Confirmation, with this memorable addreſs, <hi>if thoſe things which we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on ſeem right to your judgment, we deſire your aſſent, that ſo the Sentence of ſo many Biſhops by the approbation of

ſo great a Prince, may be obeyed, as being of greater Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> And <hi>Clovis</hi> was not wanting in reſpect to them; for he ſtiles them <hi>Holy Lords, and Popes moſt worthy of their Apoſtolical Seat.</hi> By which it is manifeſt, that <hi>Rome</hi> had then no Monopoly of theſe Titles.</p>
                     <p>I conclude that which relates to Pope <hi>Symmachus</hi> his time with one Remark, that in the year 500 the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and learned African <hi>Fulgentius</hi> came on purpoſe to viſit <hi>Rome:</hi> But the writer of his life, who acurately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes what the holy Man ſaw there, and largely ſets forth his View of <hi>Theodoric,</hi> his viſiting the Tombs of the Martyrs, and ſaluting the Monks he met with <note n="q" place="margin">Vita B. <hi>Fulgen.</hi> cap. 13. pag. 16.</note>, ſpeaks not one Syllable of the Pope, whoſe Benediction one would think <hi>Fulgentius</hi> ſhould have deſired: But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Schiſm yet continued, or <hi>Symmachus</hi> his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner did not pleaſe the good Man, 'its plain he took no notice of him.</p>
                     <p>§. 3. <hi>Hormiſda</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Symmachus,</hi> and it ſeems by <note place="margin">An. Dom. 514.</note> the Letter of <hi>Dorotheus,</hi> that in his Election (and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) the Schiſm at <hi>Rome</hi> ceaſed, which began when <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi> was choſen <note n="r" place="margin">Ep. <hi>Dorothei</hi> ap. <hi>Baron. An.</hi> 515. 7, 8. pag. 642.</note>; which ſhews that <hi>Symmachus</hi> having a ſtrong party againſt him all his time, could do nothing conſiderable. This Pope <hi>Hormiſda</hi> was either married before he was Pope, or was very criminal; for he had a Son, <hi>i. e.

                           <hi>Liberati</hi> Brev. cap. 22. <hi>Bin.</hi> par. 2 pag. 191.</note>. This was a bold and active Pope, and did labour much to reconcile the Eaſtern to the Weſtern Church, and at laſt (in ſome meaſure) effected it, after the Greeks <hi>had been ſeparated (as Binius</hi> notes) <hi>from the unity of the Church</hi> (not Catholick, but) <hi>of</hi> Rome <hi>(he means) about 80 years</hi>

The Notes further tell us, that King <hi>Clovis</hi> of <hi>France</hi> ſent <hi>Hormiſda</hi> a Golden Crown ſet with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, for a Preſent, and thereby procured this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

                     <p>An Epiſtle writ to <hi>Caeſarius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> this year, is ſuſpicious, becauſe <hi>Baronius</hi> had mentioned his Will and Teſtament ten year before <note n="d" place="margin">

to find out ſome Viſion or Dream to perſwade eaſie Readers, that all Princes who injured any Pope were ſent to Eternal Flames: Again, the Notes pretend, that <hi>Justinian</hi>'s Eccleſiaſtical Laws were made by the Biſhops of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and put out in that Emperors name: But why might not <hi>Juſtinian</hi> make his own Laws about Church matters, as <hi>Constantine</hi> and all his Succeſſors to this time had done? No doubt he and they uſed in ſuch caſes to adviſe with their own Biſhops: But theſe Paraſites of <hi>Rome</hi> are angry, that the Pope is not the ſole Law-maker in Cauſes Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; now he was not ſo much as conſulted in theſe Laws, being then the Subject of another Prince: And what they object of <hi>Justinian</hi>'s ſpeaking honourably of <hi>Zeno</hi> and <hi>Anastaſius</hi> his Predeceſſors (Enemies to <hi>Rome)</hi> confirms me in the Opinion, that <hi>Justinian</hi> in compoſing theſe Laws took no advice from St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair.</p>

(as <hi>Sirmondus</hi> owns <note n="k" place="margin">Not. <hi>Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.

                     <p>The Notes upon this Council cite a Teſtimony out of <hi>Gennadius, that Pope</hi> Foelix <hi>approved a Book writ by</hi> Caeſarius <hi>against the Pelagians</hi>

But when ſuch learned Men as <hi>Proſper</hi> and <hi>Caeſarius</hi> writ againſt an Hereſie, the Popes <hi>Celeſtine</hi> and <hi>Foelix</hi> gladly ſubſcribed them, not to give the Books any greater Authority, but to prove themſelves Orthodox, and in Communion with men ſo famous for defending the Catholick Faith.</p>
                     <p>The Second or Third Council of <hi>Vaiſon,</hi> was falſly <note place="margin">An. Dom. 529.</note> placed by <hi>Binius under Pope</hi> John <hi>the ſecond, who was not Pope till two years after</hi>

In the firſt Canon it would have appeared plainly, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders then had Wives allowed, if the true reading had ſtood, which muſt be <hi>Lectores—ſuas uxores habentes—recipiant.</hi> But the Forgers have altered it in <hi>Binius</hi> thus,—<hi>ſive uxores habuerint;</hi> in <hi>Labbè</hi> thus, <hi>ſine uxore, &amp;c.</hi> But the corrupters in both Editions have left this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage ſo abuſed, that it is neither Grammar nor Senſe. The fourth Canon is double in <hi>Binius; Labbè</hi> hath made it but one; it orders <hi>That the Popes name ſhall be recited in the Gallican Offices.</hi> Now to make this Canon ſeem more ancient, the Paraſites had hoiſted up this Council 200 year, even as high as Pope <hi>Julius,</hi> where <hi>Binius</hi> ſhameleſly prints it: But <hi>Sirmondus</hi> proves there could be no ſuch French Council at that time: And conſidering the Forgers have been ſo buſie with this Canon, I judge it very probable, that it was made by a Council much later than this Age, only it is clapt in

here very abruptly, to ſupport an earlier Grandeur than the Popes at the time enjoyed; I am ſure it ſeems unlikely, the Gallican Church ſhould then pay this great reſpect to <hi>Rome.</hi>

Another Evidence of this Popes raſhneſs was a Decree made alſo in this Synod, <hi>That the Pope ſhould name his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> which was not only againſt the Canons, (which this Pope and his Council here had violated,) but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an expreſs Law of the Gothick Princes; and therefore when this fallible Pope ſaw his Error, a little after he called another Synod and revoked this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, confeſſing himſelf, as <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Guilty of Treaſon,</hi> in making the former Order; by which we may ſee, in that Age it was Treaſon for the Pope in Council to Repeal a Royal Law. Wherefore I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>Baronius</hi> ſhould call that <hi>the wresting a preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and uſurped power out of the Goths hands</hi>

                     <p>But to make him look great, the Forgers have invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Epiſtle for him, containing many vaunts of the Roman Churches greatneſs, and a pretended ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Church of <hi>Carthage,</hi> after a very long ſeparation from <hi>Rome,</hi> even from the time of <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>

Now though this came out of their own Shop, it is ſo groſs an untruth in the main, That <hi>Bini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and all their later Writers reject it: But though I
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:108925:228"/>
think the Epiſtle certainly Spurious, and this ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion forged; yet it is true, the African Churches (even while they did own the Roman for an Orthodox Church,) had for a long time denied that uſurped juriſdiction of Appeals from thence to <hi>Rome,</hi> to which ſome Popes pretended, which had made them ſtand at a diſtance from the See of <hi>Rome:</hi> The Notes on this Epiſtle have a fallacious Argument however, to prove the African Church could not ſo long remain divided from the Roman; becauſe if ſo, they could have no true Martyrs all that time, ſince the Fathers agree, <hi>That Crown is only due to thoſe who ſuffer in the Catholick Church</hi> 
                        <note n="r" place="margin">Not. in Ep. 1. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 645. Col. 1. <hi>Lab.</hi> 1686.</note>. I reply, this may be very true; and yet ſince no Father ever ſaid that the particular Roman Church is the Catholick Church, a Chriſtian may dye a true Martyr if he die in the Communion of the Catholick Church, though he hold no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Roman Church, which was the caſe at this time, or lately, of many Eaſtern Churches.</p>
                     <p>Another Forgery out of the ſame Mint treads on the heels of this, pretending to be a Copy of the Emperor <hi>Juſtin,</hi> and <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s ſubmiſſion to this Pope; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are made to own the Supremacy of <hi>Rome</hi> to the higheſt pitch, and to Curſe all their Predeceſſors and Succeſſors, who did not maintain that Churches Priviledges <note n="s" place="margin">Exemplar prec. <hi>Bin.</hi> ibid. <hi>Lab.</hi> ibid. <hi>Baron. An.</hi> 530. n. 6. pag. 154.</note>. But the cheat is ſo apparent, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo improbable and ridiculous, and the date ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, that <hi>Baronius</hi> and both the Editors reject it; So that I ſhall only note, that a true Doctrine could not need ſo many Forgeries to ſupport it, and the intereſt they ſerve ſhews who employed theſe Forgers.</p>
                     <p>We have ſpoken before of <hi>Boniface</hi>'s two Roman Councils, one of them revoking what the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed: The third is only in <hi>Labbè,</hi> being a glorious Pageant, dreſt up by the ſuſpicious hand of a late Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary-keeper to the Pope. But it amounts to no more than the introducing a poor Greek Biſhop or two, to enquire what was ſaid in the Roman Records, and in the Popes Letters of the Authority of that Church <note n="t" place="margin">Concil.

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:108925:229"/>
So that the Pope and his Council were Judges and Witneſſes in their own Cauſe, and therefore their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is of no great Credit: And 'tis very ominous, that this Synod is dated in <hi>December,</hi> that is, two Months after <hi>Boniface</hi>'s death, who is ſaid to have been preſent at all its Seſſions <note n="u" place="margin">

The next is an Epiſtle of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> to this Pope, wherein the Emperor is pretended to declare his Faith was conformable in all things to the Roman Church; and made to ſay, <hi>he had ſubjected and united all the Churches of the</hi> Eaſt <hi>to the Pope, who is the Head of all the Holy Churches</hi>—with much more ſtuff of this kind <note n="a" place="margin">Ep. <hi>Juſtin.</hi> ad <hi>Joan. 2.

Sacerdotes univerſi orientalis tractus, &amp; ſubjicere</hi>—till you come to theſe words—<hi>Petimus ergo veſtrum paternum</hi>—: Which when the Reader hath well noted, he will admire, that thoſe who had the cunning to corrupt a Princes Letter, by adding twice as much to it as he writ, ſhould be ſo ſilly to print the true Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, within a few Pages: But doubtleſs God infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates ſuch Corrupters, and the Devil owes a ſhame to Lyers.</p>
                     <p>The next Epiſtle from the Gothic King <hi>Athalaric,</hi> was probably writ ſoon after <hi>John</hi>'s Election, ſince it mentions the Romans coming to that Prince, to beg leave to chuſe a Pope; and both <hi>Athalario</hi> and the Senate made Laws to prevent <hi>Simony</hi> in the Election of the Pope, as well as other Biſhops: And which <hi>(Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> ſaith,) <hi>was more Ignominious, This Edict was Ingraven on a Marble Table, and hung up before the Court of St.</hi> Peters <hi>for all to ſee it</hi>

However, the great impertinence of divers Scriptures here cited ſhews this Pope to be no great Divine, and one of his proofs I doubt is forged; for I cannot, in <hi>Exod.</hi> xxiv. or any other place find theſe words, <hi>You ſhall ſee your life hanging on a Tree:</hi> Now to feign ſuch a Propheſie muſt be a horrid Sin, being literally <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods word</hi>

                     <p>The Epiſtle from <hi>Reparatus</hi> and his African Council to this Pope, is more likely to be true, becauſe there is nothing of his Univerſal Supremacy in it: They call him <hi>Holy Brother and Fellow-Prieſt,</hi> nor do they expect Laws, but deſire advice from him: Yea, they require him to exclude from his Communion ſuch of the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Clergy, as came from them to <hi>Rome</hi> without leave <note n="i" place="margin">Ep. <hi>Repar.

Now this could not be meant of the Roman Church, where <hi>Hormiſda</hi>'s contrary Definition was ſtill in force, nor do they name the Pope in all their Conference: So that <hi>Binius</hi> is miſtaken in his Notion, that <hi>Juſtinian</hi> contrived this Conference to unite the Biſhops of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> with <hi>Rome;</hi> for he took no notice of the late Popes Sentence, but deſigned this Conference to ſettle the Truth; and for all the pretence of Union and Subjection in <hi>Hormiſda</hi>'s time, the Churches of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> were not united till after this; when Pope <hi>John</hi> conſented to their Deſinition, and owned that not his Predeceſſor, but they were in the right.</p>

                     <p>The matter of <hi>Agapetus</hi> Second and Third Epiſtle to the African Biſhops and <hi>Reparatus</hi> is not exceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for the Pope calls them <hi>his moſt loving Brothers, and owns it was not agreeable to the Canons to receive Clerks from</hi> Africk <hi>without their Letter;</hi> wherefore he would forbear it, as they had enjoyned: He confeſſes alſo the Rights of a Metropolitan to be in the Biſhop of <hi>Carthage</hi>

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:108925:233"/>
they are not genuine, for they ſay they were ſent by <hi>Liberatus:</hi> Now he had been at <hi>Rome</hi> a little before, and can ſcarce be ſuppoſed to be got back to <hi>Afric,</hi> and to return to <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>5th</hi> of the Ides of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember:</hi> And which is worſe, (as <hi>Labbè</hi> truly obſerves,) <hi>Liberatus</hi> himſelf who writes the Story of <hi>Agapetus,</hi> ſpeaks but of one Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſays nothing of this ſecond: And beſides 'tis dated <hi>Poſt. Conſ. Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lini,</hi> which is wrong, unleſs they call <hi>Belliſarius</hi> his year by that name, which is <hi>An.</hi> 535. And then <hi>Agapetus</hi> was at <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> So that we may fear the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who would have it thought all the World ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to <hi>Rome,</hi> have been at work here. However, if the third Letter be genuine, we learn from it that <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus</hi> came into the Papacy in Winter; for it ſeems <hi>Reparatus</hi> had writ to Pope <hi>John;</hi> but while his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were ſtaied by the Winter from Sailing, he heard in <hi>Afric</hi> of <hi>Agapetus</hi> his Election. <hi>Baronius</hi> here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that the Pope now ſent <hi>Decretal</hi> Letters to be publiſhed in <hi>Africa,</hi> which are not extant <note n="k" place="margin">
                           <hi>Baron. An.</hi> 535. n. 42. pag. 222.</note>: But I believe there never were any ſuch Letters; for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice might be accepted there perhaps, but his Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals then had no Authority in that Church.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Epiſtle to <hi>Juſtinian</hi> is very ſuſpicious, being dated with no Conſuls as the reſt uſe to be; it mentions alſo the Popes ſending Legates on the Ides of <hi>October,</hi> which if it were <hi>An.</hi> 534. he was not then Pope; if the next year, <hi>Agapetus</hi> muſt then be at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> (or dead there the 12 of the Kal. of that Month, if the Roman Martyrology be true:) Wherefore we need not be ſtartled at that incredible paſſage, <hi>That</hi> Juſtinian <hi>had elevated the Roman See by ſuch Titles of Charity and Bounty, as exceeded their deſires and hopes</hi>

For the Letter is not genuine; And I dare ſay, the Paraſites will not urge this, becauſe they think 'tis Juſtice, not Charity; and Right, not human Bounty, which gives <hi>Rome</hi> the higheſt Titles; and we are of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, no Titles can exceed that Churches deſires, though they may its deſerts.</p>

Since <hi>Binius</hi> ſuſpects the <hi>5th</hi> Epiſtle, as dated before <hi>Agapetus</hi> was Pope, and <hi>Labbè</hi> ſaith, <hi>many things prove it falſe, and more than ſuſpected of impoſture, as being stolen out of</hi> Hormiſda's, <hi>and</hi> Leo's <hi>Letters, and naming</hi> Theodatus <hi>Conſul, who never bore that Office</hi>

                     <p>The two Epiſtles to <hi>Caeſarius</hi> (ſuppoſing them genuine) are very frivolous, the <hi>6th</hi> being only to tell him that Eccleſiaſtical Goods muſt not be alienated: Which he knew better than the Pope; and <hi>Symmachus</hi> had writ this to him above 30 Year before: And the <hi>7th</hi> Epiſtle intimates that <hi>Contumelioſus</hi> a French Criminal Biſhop, whoſe Cauſe was decided by Pope <hi>John,</hi> had appealed again to <hi>Agapetus,</hi> which ſhews a Papal Decree was not deciſive: But either the Pope or this Letter hath had ill Luck, becauſe it contains in the decretal part, a flat contradiction, both forbidding, and allowing this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop to ſay Maſs <note n="n" place="margin">Ep. 6, &amp; 7. <hi>Agap.

Thirdly, examine the falſhoods in the Notes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, This Council was called to re-examine and confirm the Sentence of Pope <hi>Agapetus,</hi> and it conſiſted (all but five) of Eaſtern Biſhops <note n="s" place="margin">Concil.

And <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus</hi> himſelf in a Letter writ a little before his death, deſires the Eaſtern Biſhops to ſignifie to him, <hi>That they did approve of the judgment of the Apoſtolical Seat</hi> 
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Act. 1. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 687. <hi>Lab.</hi> 47.</note>; Which ſhews that neither the Emperor, the Pope, nor this Council did then take the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the ſole nor higheſt Judge. Secondly, <hi>Mennas</hi> the Patriarch was the Preſident of this Council, and ſat above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe five Biſhops, which the Annaliſt, and Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator ſay were the Legates of <hi>Agapetus,</hi> and the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the Roman Church <note n="u" place="margin">lb. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 672. <hi>Lab.</hi> 3. &amp; 4.</note>. Thirdly, it is certain the Emperor <hi>Juſtinian</hi> convened this Council by his own ſole Authority; for every Action owns <hi>They met by his Pious Command, and that his care had gathered this Holy Synod together</hi> 
                        <note n="w" place="margin">Vid. Act. i. &amp; alibi. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 689, 691, 696, &amp; 710. Item <hi>Lab.</hi> pag. 54, 59, 71 &amp; 118.</note>. And it is as certain that he only could and did confirm it; for <hi>Mennas</hi> the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident having heard the Synods Opinion, deſires the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror may be acquainted with it, <hi>Becauſe nothing ought to be done in the Church without his Royal Conſent, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>

                           <hi>Bin.</hi> Act. v. pag. 703. <hi>Lab.</hi> 61.</note>. <hi>And he finally did confirm their Decree by a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Edict, which made it valid</hi> 
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Ibid. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 761. <hi>Lab.</hi> 263.</note>. So that this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil utterly confutes the Popes pretended right to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene all Councils, for which in this Age nothing but Forged evidence is produced.

                           <hi>Baron. An.</hi> 536. n. 32. pag. 246.</note>, and alſo <hi>Binius</hi> do affirm that <hi>Agapetus</hi> did both depoſe <hi>Anthimius,</hi> and chuſe <hi>Mennas,</hi> neither of them is true if they mean the Pope did it by his own Authority; for before the Council, <hi>Juſtinian</hi> (as this
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:108925:234"/>
Synod often declares) did aſſiſt <hi>Agapetus,</hi> and made the Holy Canons Authentic in depoſing <hi>Anthimius</hi>

And becauſe he thought it was ſcarce yet Canonically done, he gets the Sentence againſt him confirmed by this Council: As for <hi>Mennas,</hi> he was only conſecrated by the Pope, who in his own Letter ſaith <hi>Mennas was elected by the favour of the Emperor, and the conſent of the chief Men, the Monks and all Orthodox Chriſtians</hi> 
                        <note n="b" place="margin">
                           <hi>Bin.</hi> Act. i. pag. 687. <hi>Lab.</hi> 47.</note>; yea, the Council declares the Emperor choſe him by the general ſuffrage <note n="c" place="margin">Ibid. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 677. <hi>Lab.</hi> 19.</note>. So that theſe are falſe pretences deſigned to ſet up a ſingle Authority in the Pope, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to that Age.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In the Acts of this Council there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers inſtances of the hand of a Roman depraver: The Title of the Monks Petition, as <hi>Binius</hi> Margen ſaith, <hi>is not in the Greek</hi>

                     <p>In the Notes on this Council are many Falſhoods, which may be diſcovered by what is already obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Only we may conſider ſome few of them more particularly: As firſt, He takes it upon <hi>Baronius</hi> his credit <note n="h" place="margin">
                           <hi>Baron.

                        <note n="k" place="margin">Ib. <hi>Bin.</hi> pag. 764. <hi>Lab.</hi> 270.</note>; yet immediately calls him alone the Preſident of this Synod <note n="l" place="margin">Ibid. 764. col 2. <hi>Lab.</hi> 272</note>. Now all this is to impoſe upon the Reader, as if nothing could be done without Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Authority: But we have proved that <hi>Juſtinian</hi> called and confirmed this Council, and <hi>Mennas</hi> preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſolely in it: The <hi>Acts</hi> alſo take no notice of theſe Weſtern Biſhops having any Legantine power from <hi>Agapetus;</hi> and I ſhall ſhew preſently, that before this Council roſe there was a new Pope choſen, who ſhould

have renewed their Commiſſion to make it valid, but did not: So that they muſt ſuppoſe the dead and the living Pope to have ſupream Authority both at once: Who can ſwallow theſe groſs Fictions? Again, <hi>Mennas</hi> and the Council declare, <hi>That Pope followed the Canons in allowing</hi> Anthimius <hi>time to come in and Repent, and therefore they followed him</hi>

But the Latins are even with them and far out-do them, (if it were ſo) for they (as we have ſeen) have put in that Title for <hi>Agapetus</hi> into the Latin when it was not in the Greek, and have left it out before <hi>Menuas</hi> name, though in the Code it be given him: So that they cannot fairly complain; Yet after all, I can prove by authentic Records of this Age, That this Title of <hi>Oecumenical Patriarch,</hi> was given to the Patriarch of both old and new <hi>Rome;</hi> nor is this Council of <hi>John</hi> corrupted by the modern Greeks, and <hi>Gregory</hi> is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly miſtaken in ſaying it was not uſed before his time: But the weakeſt complaint of Forgery, and the worſt proof of it imaginable, is that of <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binius,</hi> who pretend the Greeks have fraudulently put the names of <hi>Euphemius</hi> and <hi>Macedonius</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> before Pope <hi>Leo's</hi>

Church where theſe Prayers were made: To prove which and ſhame this illiterate Expoſition, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Jac.

                     <p>Which ſhews, how little reaſon there is for <hi>Baronius</hi> and the Notes, to make ſuch a ſtir which was the true Pope of theſe two.

But they cannot prove this by any Evidence, but only by a manifeſtly forged Epiſtle of <hi>Sylverius.</hi> And the contrary is very certain, becauſe the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, the Gallican Churches and all did own <hi>Vigilius</hi> for the true Pope long before <hi>Sylverius</hi> his death, and he openly acted as ſuch all that time.

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:108925:239"/>
purged him of all Crimes, and in a moment made him a Saint and a rare Pope: He would force this Fiction out of <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> (who in like Caſes he gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally deſpiſes,) who only ſaith, <hi>the See was void ſix days,</hi> but plainly means <hi>after</hi> Sylverius <hi>was depoſed;</hi> for he reckons <hi>Vigilius</hi> his time from thence, allotting him above 17 years and 6 Months; that is, near two years more than <hi>Baronius</hi> allows.</p>
                     <p>There are but two Epiſtles aſcribed to <hi>Sylverius,</hi> and they are the only Evidence to prove him the true Pope after he was Depoſed; yet it is certain both are Forg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                     <p>The firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Vigilius</hi> is writ to three notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hereticks, wherein he aſſures them he holds the ſame Faith with them <note n="b" place="margin">

                     </p>
                     <p>To whom about this time <hi>Vigilius</hi> openly writ an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Letter, though <hi>Baronius</hi> and the Editors place it <hi>Anno</hi> 540. and call it his <hi>4th</hi> Epiſtle, pretending it was writ after <hi>Baronius</hi> his invented new election, and when the Holy Chair had ſet him right in Faith <note n="f" place="margin">Ep. 4. <hi>Vigil.</hi> ad <hi>Juſtin.

But my reaſon why I judge it writ <hi>Anno</hi> 538 ſoon after his entrance, is becauſe it was cuſtomary for a new Pope to write to the Emperor, and give an Account of his Faith; and ſince <hi>Vigilius</hi> had been advanced by <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> it is not at all likely he ſhould ſtay almoſt three years before he ſent an Embaſſy to enquire if he were Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox; and this Epiſtle having no Date they have clapt to it, another to <hi>Mennas,</hi> with a Date that ſmells of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, becauſe the Emperors Embaſſador is made to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the Popes Letter <hi>Anno</hi> 540, which is a thing ſo unuſual, that either <hi>Juſtinian</hi> highly ſuſpected <hi>Vigilius,</hi> or this Poſtſcript is added by <hi>Mercator</hi>

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:108925:241"/>
Severus</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> that he was of the ſame Faith with them, and it being alſo probable that he writ theſe open Letters to <hi>Justinian</hi> and <hi>Mennas</hi> at the ſame time wherein he anathematizes thoſe three Hereticks by name, and profeſſes himſelf Orthodox, this proves him a moſt egregious Hypocrite and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler in points of Faith. I ſhall only briefly note on this fourth Epiſtle, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> reckning up the names of his immediate Predeceſſors, names not <hi>Sylve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> among them, which ſeems to intimate he was then alive: And Secondly, if <hi>Mercator</hi> did not thruſt in that Sentence, <hi>That to diſturb, or diminiſh the Priviledges of the Apoſtolical Seat, appeared as bad as violating the Faith:</hi> If this (ſay,) be not a latter Addition, we may infer, That <hi>Vigilius</hi> was more concerned for the power of his See, than for the Faith.</p>
                     <p>That which the Editors call the Second Epiſtle, was writ to one <hi>Eutherius Anno</hi> 538: And though they and <hi>Baronius</hi> ſay he was then no true Pope <note n="h" place="margin">Ep. 2. <hi>Vigil.

And by that Rule, <hi>Vigilius</hi> would have been Heretical for his Decree: Whereas the truth is, he never made any ſuch Decree; for <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> affirms, that from his firſt coming to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> until the Council, he always was for condemning the three Chapters <note n="k" place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin.</hi> ad Concil. 5.

By which it is clear, the Hiſtorian means nothing but that conſent, which by word and writing he had often given, as to the Synods Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion before they met, of which the fifth Council often complains, becauſe he denied it, and flew off after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note n="r" place="margin">Concil 5. collat. 1. <hi>Bin.</hi> 47 &amp; 49. <hi>Lab.</hi> 422, &amp; 425.</note>; and it was theſe precedent Writings, that both <hi>Nicephorus</hi> (s) and <hi>Photius</hi> mean <note n="t" place="margin">

                  <p>Firſt, In the Epiſtle <hi>Vigilius</hi> is made to ſay, <hi>that he is and was of the ſame Faith with</hi> Eutychius, <hi>and the reſt of the Biſhops at</hi> Conſtantinople: But if ſo, why did he exclaim that the Catholick Faith was in danger to be rooted up <note n="b" place="margin">
                        <hi>Baron. An.</hi> 546. pag. n. 47.</note>? Or how came he to Anathematize <hi>Theodorus?</hi> And why did he ſuffer ſo much for a matter that was not of Faith?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In this Epiſtle <hi>Vigilius Anathematizeth all that at any time believed the three Chapters ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or defended, and all that have endeavoured to hinder their being condemned</hi> 
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>Vigil.</hi> ap. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 600.</note>: Now is it probable he ſhould curſe all his Friends in <hi>Africa</hi> and in the Weſtern Church, yea and himſelf ſo dreadfully, who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and defended them, and done all in his power to hinder their condemnation?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This illuſtrious Monument (as 'tis called) can be no confirmation of the <hi>5th</hi> Council, becauſe it never names or ſo much as hints at that Council. So that it can paſs for no more than <hi>Vigilius</hi> his Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his former Opinions, and being writ after the Council, ſeems to be deſigned for the Emperors private
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:108925:265"/>
ſatisfaction: For the Eaſtern Church then did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Popes confirmation neceſſary, to make a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils Decrees valid:</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This Epiſtle is dated in <hi>December,</hi> and the Council aroſe but in <hi>June</hi> before, which argues the falſhood of it; for it is not likely that he ſhould ſo ſoon revoke his ſolemn conſtitution, and make ſo great a change, or if he did, it is ſtrange that living above two years after, he did not receive ſome mark of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian</hi>'s favour in all that time, no nor return to his See in Peace.</p>
                  <p>As to the Diſſertation of <hi>de Marca,</hi> we may note <note n="d" place="margin">Diſſert. Num. i. <hi>Lab.</hi> pag. 601.</note>, that the years when, and the place where this writing was found, give juſt ſuſpicions of its being an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture: It was (it ſeems) found by a Greek, <hi>An.</hi> 1276. in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and he pretended to Tranſcribe it out of a Manuſcript there writ <hi>An.</hi> 753. Now the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of theſe is dated two hundred years after the <hi>5th</hi> Council, and all that time no body ever heard of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius</hi> his Confirmation; and if this date be genuine, it might very probably be invented at that time, being the very time when the Eaſtern Church began (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſentiments of <hi>Rome)</hi> to pull down their Images; and that was a fit ſeaſon to produce Evidence, that the Greeks ought to ſubmit to the Latins, whoſe Popes as they pretended had made all their General Councils Decrees Authentick. And the date of the later Tranſcript is more ſuſpicious ſtill, being the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical time when the poor Eaſtern Emperor <hi>Nich. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laelogus</hi> for getting Money and Aid from the Pope, was forced to ſend ſome corrupted Biſhops, to make a ſeeming Submiſſion to, and Union with the Roman Church, and to carry on this deſign <hi>An.</hi> 1276. no doubt, care was taken to find out or make this Epiſtle and ſend it into <hi>Greece:</hi> And the Vatican whence it was taken, is known to be the Mint and Ware-houſe of Forgeries: So that every circumſtance is ſuſpicious. And ſo is the Reaſon, which the learned Patron of it gives why it is ſo valuable, <hi>viz. becauſe it vindicates
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:108925:266"/>
the credit of the Roman See, which was much leſſened by the belief, that the</hi> 5th <hi>Council was owned for a lawful and general, though</hi> Vigilius <hi>oppoſed it.</hi> Now at <hi>Rome</hi> where the Popes Authority is the main if not the ſole point of Religion, there have been innumerable Writings piouſly forged, to carry on this great end, and this ſeems to be of that ſort, only it appeared not early enough for <hi>Baronius</hi> to cite it; however as our Author notes, he gueſſed there was (or foreſaw there would be) ſuch a thing; For he poſitively avers, (as was ſhewed) upon meer conjecture, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the <hi>5th</hi> Council: But he and his party lay it down for a Maxim, that nothing can be a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council, but what is confirmed by the Pope: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Evidence or not Evidence, <hi>Binius</hi> and <hi>Baronius</hi> affirm it was ſo; and they are as confident who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw this Epiſtle, as <hi>de Marca</hi> is who publiſhed it; ſo that to through-paced Catholicks who take their words, this Epiſtle is a needleſs diſcovery.</p>
                  <p>But let us ſee, what Authority he hath to ſupport <note place="margin">Num. ii. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 601.</note> this famous Confirmation: He ſaith <hi>Evagrius</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that Vigilius <hi>conſented in writing, but would not come to the Council</hi>

                        <hi>Evagr.</hi> Hiſt. lib. 4. c. 34.</note>: But this conſent was before the Synod met, and is therefore plainly ſet down in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagrius</hi> before the convening, with which conſent in writing both <hi>Justinian</hi> and the Council do often upbraid this inconſtant Pope: Nor can <hi>Evagrius</hi> be expounded of any ſubſequent conſent, ſince he goes on after this paſſage to relate the acts of the Council: Nor do any of the later Greeks who follow him ſay any more, than to imply <hi>Vigilius</hi> his precedent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: And the <hi>6th</hi> Council relate the calling of the <hi>5th</hi> Council, after the agreement between <hi>Juſtinian</hi> and <hi>Vigilius</hi> 
                     <note n="f" place="margin">Concil. 6. Act. 18. Tom. iii. par. 1. pag. 194.</note>; nor can their words without mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt violence be ſtretched to this Confirmation, which had it then been extant in the Greek Copy, and (as <hi>de Marca</hi> owns) wanting in the Latin <note n="g" place="margin">Diſſertat. inſr. n. 21. pag. 612.</note>, that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil had found out and obſerved this among other Variations.</p>

The Teſtimony of <hi>Pelagius</hi> which our Author thinks <note place="margin">Num. iii. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 603.</note> ſo clear, is no Evidence unleſs it be againſt this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle; for he ſpeaks not of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> but of the Latin Church, which <hi>came ſlowly to ſee their Error—laboured a great while—ſtrove a long time even to ſuffering—and would not of a ſudden loſe their labour, till the Truth did appear</hi>—<note n="h" place="margin">Ep. Pelag. 2. ap. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 621.</note>. This plainly refers to the Roman Clergy and Weſtern Biſhops, who after <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius</hi> death ſtood out in defence of the three Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſo ſtiſly, that <hi>Pelagius</hi> the <hi>1ſt, Vigilius</hi> his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, could ſcarce find any to conſecrate him <note n="i" place="margin">Vide not. in vit. <hi>Pelag.</hi> 1. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 788.</note>.

Lab. <hi>col.</hi> 792. Baron. An. 566. <hi>pag.</hi> 453.</note>; now this was three year after the Council. But how could <hi>Vigilius</hi> his haſty turn in ſix Months time be called a ſlow change, or a long ſtriving? And if <hi>Pelagius</hi> the ſecond had known of <hi>Vigilius</hi> his confirming the <hi>5th</hi> Council, he would not have uſed ſo many ſhifts to ward off the force of his and the Roman Churches diſſent, which was objected; this Epiſtle had ſtopt their Mouths for ever; and if St. <hi>Gregory</hi> had known of it, he had referred thoſe who doubted of the Apoſtolical conſent, not to <hi>Pelagius</hi> his Epiſtle, but to this Authentick Confirmation of <hi>Vigilius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>It is well, when <hi>de Marca</hi> reſolves to ſupport the <note place="margin">Num. iv. <hi>Lab</hi> col. cad.</note> tottering credit of this Pope, that he hath no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Evidence of <hi>Theodorus</hi> of <hi>Caeſarea</hi>'s favouring He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, than <hi>Facundus</hi> a condemned Neſtorian, and <hi>Liberatus</hi> who writes ſo partially for that ſide; it is plain, their ſpite to <hi>Theodorus</hi> was for his zeal againſt <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and for giving the Emperor that wholſome and neceſſary advice, to condemn all thoſe Men and their Writings under which the Neſtorians ſheltered themſelves; and it is ſhewed before that he was no favourer either of <hi>Origen</hi>

Yet this defender of <hi>Vigilius</hi> reflects on <hi>Justinian</hi>'s <note place="margin">Num. v. <hi>Lab.</hi> ib.</note> Edict, approved by a General Council, upon the ſingle Teſtimony of a convicted Heretick, who writes ſo bitterly againſt the Truth, that he is not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved nor eſteemed as any thing but a bigotted and provoked Adverſary: Only our Author paſſes by one thing, which is, that <hi>Facundus</hi> and <hi>Liberatus</hi> both Rail at <hi>Vigilius,</hi> for deſetting their Party, and look upon him after his coming to the Emperor as one that took the Heretical ſide, which ſhews they knew nothing of his latter change <note n="*" place="margin">Diſſertat. Inſr. Num. viii. col. 604.</note>. As to what he ſaith, <hi>That there was nothing of Faith controverted in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, but only concerning Perſons,</hi> This is fully anſwered before <note n="m" place="margin">See the Hiſt. chap. 5.</note>: And I will only note the weakneſs of this diſtinction; For what difference is there between condemning a Mans Heretical Opinions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning that Man for holding thoſe Opinions? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Arians ſhould pretend, that becauſe <hi>Arius</hi> was condemned at <hi>Nice,</hi> the Controverſie there was about a Perſon, not about the Faith, Will <hi>de Marca</hi> allow that diſtinction? And the like may be ſaid of <hi>Macedonius, Eutyches</hi> and <hi>Neſtorius</hi> in former Councils: Certain it is, that in this Council the Writings or Opinions of <hi>Theodorus</hi> and his Perſon alſo are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and ſo are the Opinions of <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Ibas</hi> before their Recantation, but not their Perſons; and the main Queſtion in the fifth Council, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe Writings of theſe three there cited were Heretical? which I think is a matter of Faith and not of Perſons.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, ſince the Neſtorian Hereticks gloried in theſe Writings, the Queſtion whether they ſhould <note place="margin">Num. vi. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 604.</note> be condemned or no, was not (as he pretended) concerning diſcipline; and ſo there is no room for his impertinent diſtinction of <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Facundus</hi> may be a good witneſs that <hi>Vigilius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed <note place="margin">Num. vii. <hi>Lab.</hi> ib. &amp; Num. viii. ib.</note> the three Chapters, before his coming to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and perhaps he might ſuſpend <hi>Mennas</hi> after his coming to that City, (as <hi>de Marca</hi> out of <hi>Theophanes</hi> ſaith). But ſince <hi>Mennas</hi> died that very year, as is proved by the Acts of the ſixth Council at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where they muſt needs know the time of their own Patriarchs death, but in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Century <note n="n" place="margin">Concil. vi.

For therein the Clergy of <hi>Italy</hi> tell a long Story to the French Legates upon hear-ſay, to inform them what <hi>Vigilius</hi> was then doing and ſuffering at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where theſe Legates then were; and whereas they might ſo eaſily have informed <hi>France</hi> of this by Letters from <hi>Rome,</hi> they deſire the Legates to write this from <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> to the Gallican Church. Again, theſe rare Clerks ſay, that <hi>Dacius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Milan</hi> had been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from his Church 15 or 16 year, till' all the Biſhops of his ordaining were dead, ſo that vaſt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes died for want of Baptiſm, (it ſeems neither Lay-men nor Presbyters might then Baptize:) But if <hi>Dacius</hi> did fly from <hi>Milan</hi> when it was taken by the Goths <note n="r" place="margin">Baron.

                  <p>The long Hiſtory therefore of <hi>Vigilius</hi> his return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Num. ix. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 605.</note> to his Vomit, and of his being perſecuted by <hi>Justinian,</hi> depending on nothing but forged relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is to be wholly rejected; and that Letter which <hi>Eutychius</hi> writ to <hi>Vigilius,</hi> to have the three Chapters condemned in a lawful Council, whereunto <hi>Vigilius</hi> by Letter conſented in <hi>January</hi> 554 <note n="s" place="margin">Vid.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Vigilius</hi> only covered his Neſtorian principles with theſe ſhifts, and his main Argument of the paucity <note place="margin">Num. x. <hi>Lab.</hi> ibid.</note> of Weſtern Biſhops, is abundantly confuted by the Councils, ſhewing there were more of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent then at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> than had been in any former General Council. And the event ſhewed, that
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:108925:268"/>
neither his abſence nor diſſenting could hinder this, which our Author wrongfully calls <hi>an imperfect meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> from being univerſally received as a General Council.</p>
                  <p>The Conſtitution of <hi>Vigilius</hi> is proved Heretical be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Numb. xi &amp; xii. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 606.</note>

For how could <hi>Justinian</hi> be ſo ſilly, as to ſuppoſe he could keep the Biſhops then aſſembled ignorant of <hi>Vigilius</hi> his averſion to condemning the three Chapters, when he would not come at them, (and if <hi>de Marca</hi> ſay true) ſuffered ſuch injuries for defending them? 'tis plain they knew his Mind, and do parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly confute his Conſtitution, only ſparing his name; yea, 'tis Evident, they lookt on him as a ſickle Man, and publiſhed nothing but his firſt and ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Judgment, and never ceaſed acting vigorouſly for all his diſſent; for the Greeks at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> had ſhewed, they looked on a Councils Decrees as valid, though the Pope oppoſed them.</p>
                  <p>After all he hath no Witneſſes of his Exile, but the <note place="margin">Num. xiii. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 607.</note> fabulous <hi>Anaſtaſius;</hi> all the Greeks (he confeſſes) are ſilent as to his ſufferings, and ſo are all Authentick Latin Hiſtories too. The Epiſtle of <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> was writ 500 year after, and only ſpeaks of ſome difference between <hi>Vigilius</hi> and <hi>Mennas,</hi> which muſt be at his firſt coming to <hi>Conſtantinople Anno</hi> 547, but that is nothing to this time after the Council.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems ſtrange, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> ſhould paſs for ſo <note place="margin">Numb. xiv. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 609.</note> great a Politician by the art uſed in this Epiſtle; for if it were his, I ſhould think he never intended to confirm the fifth Council by it, becauſe he never names it; which ſilence muſt proceed either from his fear to anger the Weſtern Biſhops, with whom he joyned ſtill in heart, or from his hope that the bare recanting his Opinions, would cajole the Emperor and his Greeks; and if we conſider his Hypocriſie and often changes, both of theſe might make him
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:108925:269"/>
omit the naming the fifth Council: But being a Forgery, we need not any conjectures about the reaſon of a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entity: Yet if I were convinced <hi>Vigilius</hi> writ this Epiſtle, I ſhould believe the date was falſe, and that this was his firſt Recantation after he came to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> before this Synod met, which is the moſt probable reaſon, why he did not name this fifth Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe no ſuch had yet been.</p>
                  <p>It was not the Greeks, but the Latins who put this Epiſtle to the end of the Acts of the fifth Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, <note place="margin">Numb. xv. ib.</note> for in their Vatican it was firſt pretended to be found; but whoever added it, muſt be very weak to imagin an unlawful Synod could be confirmed by a Popes private Opinion delivered ſix months after, or that any body elſe ſhould receive a Council upon his Authority, who did not own it himſelf. <hi>Photius</hi> lived 300 year after this Council had been owned for a General Council, and what he ſaith may well be explained of the Letters of his which were read in the Council, importing that once he was of their mind. The Arabick Manuſcript is ſo full of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, that its Authority muſt be inconſiderable; it ſays, that the living and dead were never excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated before this Synod, and that the Popes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith was writ not to <hi>Eutychius,</hi> but to the Emperor <hi>Juſtinian:</hi> And all theſe Teſtimonies amount to no more, than that which the Emperor and the Council both gave out, that <hi>Vigilius</hi> was (as indeed he had often declared) of the Councils Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                  <p>'Tis certain <hi>Pelagius</hi> the firſt, <hi>Vigilius</hi> his immediate ſucceſſor, and who was with him at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>

of <hi>Vigilius</hi> conſent and confirmation, is next to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that he know of no ſuch thing, and that no ſuch thing ever was: As for all the reſt they owned it for a lawful General Council, but not one of them knew of the ſubſequent conſent of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius.</hi>

But perhaps <hi>Vigilius</hi> might act diſpenſatively in <note place="margin">Num. xviii. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 611.</note> this change, for it is likely he ſtill kept a Neſtorian Heart, only this ſpoils his ſecond reaſon, why <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> writ this Epiſtle, <hi>viz.

                  <p>If <hi>Vigilius</hi> had gon to the Council he might have <note place="margin">Num. xix &amp; xx, <hi>Lab.</hi> 611.</note> learned thoſe two Rules <hi>de Marca</hi> ſpeaks of, in ſix days, without the help of Revelation: But the feigned Epiſtle ſays nothing of ſuch Rules; it pretends that <hi>Vigilius</hi> now underſtood the Perſon and Writings of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> and the Writings of <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Ibas</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Cyril</hi> were Heretical, and that it was his duty to pronounce them Heretical, and condemn them as ſuch; yea, Anathematize them; and is this only a point of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline? May Hereticks and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:108925:270"/>
their Opinions be either condemned or not? and is it an indifferent thing, whether a Pope abſolve and defend, or accurſe and condemn in ſuch caſes? Surely the great name of <hi>de Marca</hi> is forged and put to this weak tract; he would not have argued at this rate.</p>
                  <p>That the Acts of this Council were early tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <note place="margin">Num. xxi. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 612.</note> into Latin for the uſe of the Weſtern Church, is probable enough; but <hi>Vigilius</hi> needed not this Tranſlation; he had lived at <hi>Constantinople</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was Pope, and now ſix years together after he was Pope, and ſo muſt underſtand Greek perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But the true reaſon why <hi>Vigilius</hi> Epiſtle was not added to theſe Latin Acts, was becauſe there was no ſuch Epiſtle then invented: For had he then writ ſuch an Epiſtle, or in ſix Months after, it would certainly have been joyned to both the Greek and Latin Copies for all Mens ſatisfaction who were ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized by his diſſent, eſpecially if that (which <hi>de Marca</hi> ſuppoſes) had been thought true in thoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Decrees of a General Council were invalid without the Popes Confirmation: But this is an Opinion of later Birth.</p>
                  <p>Whatever he ſaith in defence of the ſincerity of <note place="margin">Num. xxii. <hi>Lab.</hi> ib.</note> the Latin Acts, I agree to; but ſince he borrows from <hi>Crakenthorp,</hi> not only his Arguments, but his conjectures alſo, (ſuch as altering the name of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnus</hi> into <hi>John, &amp;c.)</hi> I muſt believe the Author of this diſcourſe had ſeen <hi>Crakenthorp</hi>'s learned Hiſtory of the fifth Council, yet durſt not own it, becauſe he could not confute it.</p>
                  <p>From the ſame Author he borrows much of what <note place="margin">Num. xxiii, &amp;c. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 613.</note> he ſays, about condemning <hi>Origen</hi>'s Opinions in this Council: But ſince the Council was riſen, before <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilius</hi> began to deliberate whether he ſhould receive their Acts or no, (yea, and their Acts as he thinks tranſlated into Latin alſo,) how could <hi>Justinian</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſend to the diſſolved Council, to know their Judgment of <hi>Origen</hi> and his Followers? Therefore <hi>de
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:108925:271"/>
Marca</hi> miſtakes the point; and the learned <hi>Craken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorp</hi> ſolves this difficulty much better <note n="b" place="margin">See the Hiſt. Chap. xxviii.</note>, to which I refer the Reader; And only will enquire how this Author and thoſe Popes he cites could truly ſay, that no matters of Faith were handled in this fifth Council, if <hi>Origen</hi> and his Heretical Opinions were here condemned, as he goes about to prove? This is a manifeſt contradiction. The Senſe of thoſe Popes and others muſt be, no Points of Faith decided at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> were called in Queſtion over again here: For the Queſtion only was, whether the Opinions in the three Chapters were not condemned in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> And the fifth Council affirming this concerning the Opinions of three Perſons, did not (as ſome feared) decree any new, or different point of Faith from the Council of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a needleſs thing to offer conjectures about <note place="margin">Num. xxv. <hi>Lab.</hi> col. 614.</note> the reaſon, why <hi>Vigilius</hi> in this Epiſtle doth not mention the condemning of <hi>Origen</hi>'s Errors; for the true reaſon is obvious, which is, Becauſe the Forger of this Epiſtle had nothing in his Eye, but to clear this Pope from the main thing he was charged with, <hi>viz.</hi> defending three Heretical Chapters, and that point he makes out: I grant he had (yet only joyntly with other Patriarchs, and by following, not leading <hi>Juſtinian)</hi> condemned <hi>Origen</hi> before, as <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus</hi> declares <note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Liberat.</hi> Breviar. cap. 23.</note>: But I muſt note, that <hi>Liberatus</hi> his telling us that ſo particularly, and ſaying nothing of <hi>Vigilius</hi> his Epiſtle to condemn the three Chapters, is a ſhrewd ſuſpicion there was no ſuch Epiſtle, ſince <hi>Liberatus</hi> writ after <hi>Vigilius</hi> death, and was a favourer of the three Chapters, and writ all that he thought might diſparage ſuch as condemned them. To conclude, either the Authority of the Pope was not ſo conſiderable in thoſe days, as this learned Apologiſt fancies, or <hi>Vigilius</hi> his carriage was ſuch, that no body enquired what ſide he was of, after his ſo often turnings; ſince he lived above two
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:108925:271"/>
years after this Council, and yet no mention in any genuine Writer is made where he was, or how he carried himſelf to the time of his death, which is ſaid to have hapned in <hi>Sicily, An.</hi> 555. So little a figure did the Roman Pontiff then make; and when the Controverſie was revived in the time of <hi>Pelagius</hi> the Second, and <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, they choſe to bury <hi>Vigilius</hi> name in ſilence, his inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to his Principles and evil Practices having made it the intereſt of the Roman Church to clap him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Hatches ſo long as his Character was remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred; and this Apologiſt had better have followed their Policy, than to raiſe him (as he hath done) only to his greater ſhame.</p>
