            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Life afford us one of the most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versified
and noblest Scenes of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story;
From the lowest condition of
following <hi>the Ewes great with young,</hi>
which yet was the most Innocent, as well as perhaps
the Happiest part of his life; he was advanced to be
the Glorious Champion and Deliverer of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
he was raised to be the People's Favourite, as
well as the King's Son-in-law: He had a secret Intail
of the Crown setled on him by a Divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and saw the Affections of his Countrey con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
with the Prophet's Designation: He was by
their indiscreet Applauses, set so far above <hi>Saul,</hi> as to
give him just cause of Jealousie; and he found, that
Blessing and Success followed him in every thing
that he went about. But a Reverse of Fortune
quickly overtook him; he was pursued by a violent
and a jealous Tyrant; forsaken by his Friends and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101262:5"/>
informed against by Flatterers; and at last for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to secure himself, by entertaining about him
such a company as ran to him for Shelter and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection;
who when they found themselves in grea<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

Only the Great and Generous <hi>Ionathan,</hi> who of all
others was the most concerned to have destroyed
him, gave upon this occasion, the perfectest Pattern
of Heroick Friendship, and was ready even to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
himself for him, whose Fortunes and Family
could not rise, but upon the ruins of his own. In
this cloudy Revolution of <hi>David</hi>'s Affairs, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that this Psalm was Penned, when all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
that he once had, seemed to fail; which obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him to flye to the <hi>Divine Help,</hi> since he found
neither Piety nor Truth left among men, to which
he could trust. It was no faintness of heart, nor want
of Courage, that brought him under this dejection
of Mind: His heart was as the heart of a Lion; yet
he could expect little from a Body of men, that
had neither Religion nor Virtue among them: It
is true, they flattered him, and boasted perhaps both
of their Zeal and Valour; <hi>They spake vanity wit<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

and their great Services. Whatsoever they might do
with their hands, they were sure, that <hi>with thei<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

their discourses, they thought their <hi>lips were their own,</hi>
and they said, <hi>Who is lord over us?</hi> For tho their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
might be under his Authority, they resolved
their Tongues should be under no restraint: His
Enemies were insolent and fierce, oppressing the
poor and needy, adding the haughtiness of Scorn,
to the cruelty of Malice: But the poor, while thus
oppressed, sighed and cried to God, who as <hi>David</hi>
believed, would at last <hi>arise, and set them at safety from

terrified with the strength of his Enemies, nor
with the weakness of his own Party; he trusted to
the Promises of God, which he knew had not that
allay of dross, that was in the words of men; they
were <hi>pure words,</hi> free from all mixture, exactly true;

this would be performed; and sure the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
was made to him, and to his Posterity; he was
persuaded he should not only be <hi>preserved from that
generation of his enemies,</hi> but that his Posterity should
be <hi>preserved for ever.</hi> This he concludes with a dark

               </gap>

               </gap>
to expect heavy Judgments from God upon them
and therefore he prayed to him for help. In speak<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
to this, I shall consider,</p>
            <p>1. What is the Importance of the two chara<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cters
here given, <hi>Godly</hi> and <hi>Faithful men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Reasons that he might then have, an<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

men of that Character to be found.</p>
            <p>3. The sad Consequences that are justly to be

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
a destitution of Religious and Honest Men.</p>
            <p>And 4<hi>thly,</hi> The only Remedy to all this, which
is an earnest Prayer to God for <hi>Help.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:101262:6"/>Follow me in these things, with that closeness
of Thought, and that fixt seriousness of Mind,
which the Importance of the Matter, and the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities
of the Day do require.</p>
            <p>To return to the two Characters of Men in my
Text. The word rendred <hi>Godly,</hi> in its strict signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
imports a benign, gentle, and good-natured
man; but this has such a relation to Religion, and is
such a disposition to it, that among the <hi>Iews</hi> this
word was in common use extended to a man that
was exact to all the duties of Religion, and strict
in the performance of them. A <hi>Godly man</hi> is not one
that places his Religion in many assumed practices,
that look solemn perhaps, but in their own nature
do not tend to make him better; that are matters
of mere Shew and Pomp, which do begin with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
that is an over-doing and over-valuing
indifferent things, and end in Hypocrisie, Faction,
and ill-nature. A <hi>Godly man</hi> is not he that understands
his Religion well, that can write, speak, and argue
closely for it, and that can make both himself and
others very angry about it, which is the true name
for the greatest part of that which the world calls
<hi>Zeal.</hi> In a word; A <hi>Godly man</hi> is not he that is very
regular in all outward Rules, and matters of Form,
and that places his Religion in the exact perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of such a circle of things, which are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101262:7"/>
acts of Religious Worship, and in which a
man may go the round very punctnally, through a
course of many years, and yet never deserve the
Character of a <hi>Godly man.</hi> He that is truly the <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man,</hi> is he that has an inward sense of a Supreme
Power that is over him, that made and governs the
world, and all things in it; that is infinitely wise
and good, and perfectly pure and holy; that sees
all things, and that will judg all men for every
thing they do, at a great Tribunal, where there shall
be no respect of persons; where all men, even the
greatest, shall be set on the level with the meanest;
and where every one shall give an account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to God, and shall receive according to what he
hath done in this life. A <hi>Godly man</hi> is he on whose
mind the sense of these things has so deeply seized,
that he studies, above all things, to resemble that
Being as much as he can, and to raise his nature to
be as perfect, as wise, and as good, as he can make
it; he endeavours to govern all his Actions in a
conformity to the Will and Laws of God; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices
when he does those things that he knows are
well pleasing to him; and is much troubled, when
the frailties of his Nature, and the force of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
carry him to any thing that offends God.
A <hi>Godly man</hi> is he that does so firmly believe, that
God by his Providence warches over all things, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101262:7"/>
he does in all his ways resign himself up to his
Will, and submits to every thing that comes to him
from that hand: And in sum; A <hi>Godly man</hi> is he that
does always acknowledg God; that rays to him
for every good thing that he desires, and chiefly
for the Inward Assistances of his Grace, to reform
and purifie his Nature, and that blesses God for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good thing that he receives: When this <hi>Godly man</hi>
prays to God either in private or publick, he does
it with so serious a temper of Mind, and such a
bent of thoughts, that he plainly perceives in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that what he does, is not the effect of habit
or custom, but rises out of an apprehension of his
own necessities, and of the Fulness and Goodness of
God: This is the Character of him that is truly
<hi>Godly;</hi> who considers not Religion as an Engine to
impose fears or hopes on the weaker part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
as the most effectual way of governing them;
nor does amuse himself with Speculations or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes
about it, as a notional and dry matter; that
does not consider it as the Cement of Parties, to
form and advance low or base Interest, but consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it as a design to form in a man new Principles,
out of which a new Nature may grow; but such
a nature as will make him the best, the amiablest,
the usefullest, and the perfectest creature that he
can possibly be in this life, and that puts him
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101262:8"/>
in a certain way to be vastly more pure and perfect
in another state. This man directs all his Studies
and Practices in Religion, to the advancing of
these Principles within himself; and he gives the
world so lovely a view of his Religion, by what
they see in him, that he does thereby promote it
more effectually, than all the most Learned Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or most Eloquent Persuaders can possibly do.
And to advance this Character to the next Branch
of it, A <hi>Godly man</hi> is certainly a <hi>Faithful man;</hi> for he
that has a true sense of Religion in him, knows
that <hi>God is true,</hi> and that in him there is no Lye nor
Deceit; <hi>that he abhors the deceitful man, and will destroy
him that speaks lies.</hi> His Religion, when it is true and
unsophisticated, works him up to such a purity of
Mind,<note place="margin">Psal. 5. 6.</note> that he always speaks <hi>the Truth as it is in his
heart.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 15. 2.</note> His belief of the Eye of God that sees
through him,<note place="margin">Eccle. 12. 14.</note> to which all things <hi>are naked and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
and that <hi>will bring every secret thing</hi> to Judgment,
obliges him to a severity in the matters of Truth,
that will shut out not only plain downright Lying
and Falshood, but that will raise him above all lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and disingenuous arts and practices, to such a
pitch of Candor and Sincerity, that every man who
has any concerns with him, will soon see what he
is to trust to, or to depend on. A <hi>Faithful man</hi> is he
that hates both Lies and Liars, and scorns those
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101262:8"/>
base and unworthy methods of Slander and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny;
he deceives no man; he may and often
ought to use decent and prudent Reserves; but in
what he says and professes, he is exact often to
keep within the Truth, but never to go beyond it:
He is true in his Actions, as well as in his words; He
is just in all the Commerce of Life, upright in all
Dealings, punctual in performing Agreements and
Promises, but slow in making many, because in
these he may often forget; but the World, that
cannot know that to be true, will be apt to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
that failure rather to a want of Sincerity, than
of Memory; for when any thing is liable to two
sorts of Judgments, the one mild, and the other
severe; the ill natured and false part of Mankind,
which is always by much the greatest, will ever pass
the worst Construction that can be made. A man
that has either the sense of truth in himself, or the
sense of the absolute necessity of it to all Human
Societies, for maintaining the Commerce and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of Mankind, will upon other Principles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
those that arise out of Religion, soon see the
beauty of Truth, and find the Indispensible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
that lie on him to love, and to practise
it: yet all these are but seeble Ties, in comparison
with those that arise out of true Religion, which
has a deeper and more certain operation for the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101262:9"/>
belief of the Allseeing Eye of God, and of the
Judgments to come; are Restraints of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
than all those which arise out of other Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;
a Man <hi>may</hi> be true and faithful, I confess,
tho he has not much Religion; but he <hi>must</hi> be true
and faithful if he has it: Besides that, a Religious
Man will be always true and faithful; whereas he
that is not so, will be, perhaps, true in the ordinary
and more obvious parts of his Life; but when he
thinks Art and Management a little necessary, and
that he can avoid a discovery, he will dispense
with all Obligations, and allow himself great Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.
Here we have in two words the Character
of such Men in whom Princes might well trust, and
from whom they might expect a good Account of
all their Affairs. A truly Godly, and a sincerely
honest Man, is the Support of a Throne, and the
Security of a State; and as there is a secret Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
about him watching over him, directing and
prospering him in all his ways; so there are
Charms in him which attract the esteem and love
of all that know him: They see in him a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Confidence, and they look for every
thing that is good from him <hi>When it goeth well
with the Righteous,</hi>

Mankind, and you will soon see how Ghastly
and Deform they look, compared to those bright
Characters with which the Godly and the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Men shine.</p>
            <p>I go next to a more Melancholly Subject,
which is to be the second Part of my Discourse;
<hi>David</hi>'s Complaint that the <hi>godly ceased, that the
faithful failed from among the children of men.</hi> Upon
this Subject we find another Psalm that lies very
near this, which carries the matter much further.
Not only <hi>godly men ceased,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 14.</note> but the Ungodly grew
to that pitch, as to <hi>say in their heart, that there was
no God; They were corrupt, they had done abominable
works, there was none that did good;</hi> by a Poetical
Figure he represents God as looking down from
Heaven, <hi>to see if there was any that did understand
and seek after God.</hi> It is some comfort, to hope
that even in a general Corruption, there are some
Men in corners that have <hi>have kept their garments
clean,</hi> and that stand in the Breach, and keep off
God's Wrath from breaking in. Now these words
shut out that secret reserve of hope; for after
God is represented as thus surveying that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the account of the Enquiry is, <hi>They are all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101262:10"/>
gone aside, they are altogether become filthy, there is
none that doth good, no not one.</hi> Not only they
did not <hi>call on God</hi> themselves, but they trod
upon the Poor, and Oppressed them; <hi>eating
them up as one-eats bread;</hi> They also reproached
the Poor because they trusted in God, which is
thus expressed; <hi>You have shamed the counsel of the
poor, because the Lord is his Refuge.</hi> I will go on
further into <hi>David</hi>'s Story, to examine upon what
grounds it was, that he made the Complaint in
my Text: He had the most reason to know
it best, and was the most concerned at it. That
Nation was God's chosen People, upon whom
he had bestowed many signal Blessings; They
were the only Nation, then in the World, that
was in Covenant with God; they had past un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
much severe Discipline, for their many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voltings
from God; They were often deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up into the hands of their Enemies, and
were as often upon their Repentance redeemed
from them; God raising up many Deliverers,
by whom he wrought upon many Occasions
a mighty Salvation for them: and very lately
God had delivered them out of the hands of the
<hi>Philistines,</hi> and had by a happy and well dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
cast of a Sling, delivered them from the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101262:10"/>
of a mighty Champion, that according to
the way of War in those times, was to be first
fought with, that defied the Armies of <hi>Israel;</hi> and
was so formidable, that no man could be found
that was thought an equal Match to him, till the
Pen-man of this Psalm, being animated and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
by God, did both undertake and succeed in
it. The People of <hi>Israel</hi> had at this time none
of the best Kings indeed; but <hi>Ionathan</hi> was their
Prince: <hi>Ionathan</hi> the Wonder and the Charm of
all succeeding Ages: <hi>Ionathan,</hi> that shewed that
true Friendship could live in a Court; and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Jealousie and Rivalry of a Crown could
neither interrupt nor cloud it. <hi>Ionathan</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of Men, because the best and noblest of Friends.
Next <hi>Ionathan,</hi> in the Eye of the People, tho be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him in the Divine Designation, was <hi>David,</hi> in
whom there appeared even then the most Heroical
Piety, and the most shining Vertues: tho after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Prosperities of an Established Reign
corrupted even these: So hard a thing it is for Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Vertue to maintain their Force in a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
Court: Yet at this time, and during the
course of those Struglings, through which he past,
he was the most extraordinary Example that any
Age had produced; his Skill in Government, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101262:11"/>
his Conduct in War, his Successes and Victories,
gave him all the Reputation of which a great
Prince was capable: But his Piety is even beyond
wonder; which appears in his turning himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all occasions to God, and in his composing
the greatest Collection of Inspired Hymns that
ever was made: in which the flights of raised
Thoughts, and the tenderness of melting Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
have made a mixture, that has been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantest
and the pleasantest Entertainment of the
Pious in all Ages. No part either of the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Story, or of his own, and no accident of his Life,
none of the depressions or elevations of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
have scaped him; but upon all these a Soul
that was ever on the Wing, takes its flights to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Heaven, and in these he has left us the
chief Helps of raising all that have come after
him thither-ward ever since. That Nation that
had so many Advantages, and such Helps, such
Laws, and such Patterns, as it had much to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
for, so it had much to apprehend when it
fell under so general a Corruption.</p>
            <p>And now I leave the History of that Nation
to come and observe the present State of our own.
<hi>Ah, tell it not in Gath!</hi> where are <hi>the Godly and the
Faithful Men?</hi> are they all gone into the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101262:11"/>
of their Fathers? or are they as invisible as
the Seven thousand men were in <hi>Elijah</hi>'s time; who
tho they had not bowed their Knee to <hi>Baal,</hi>
yet were so hid, and so little known, that even
the Prophet thought he was the only Man that was
left that had not defiled himself with that Idolatry?
Are we without a Remnant? Are there not Ten
Righteous Men left, for whose sake God may be
moved to spare and deliver us? Is there not a
Man among us according to <hi>Ieremy</hi>'s Words? Are
all gone aside? Is there none that doth good, no
not one? Where is the Piety and Devotion, the
Zeal for Religion, and the Holiness becoming it,
that was was once the Strength, as well as the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of this Nation? Where is the Truth and Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
the common Morality and Probity that must
be the Strength of every Nation? Have these things
all left us? and have we only a Name, that we
live, while we are truly dead? We are now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to Fast and Pray; and to humble and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
our Souls before God; but are any of us
looking inward, and saying within our selves,
<hi>What have we done? are we those that have troubled
our</hi> Israel? It is a very easie Thought, which will
give us no Pain at all, to accuse the Sins of the
Nation in general, and more particularly the Sins
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101262:12"/>
of others: These we may be apt enough to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
both in our Thoughts and Discourses:
for naturally all Men are partial to themselves,
and sharp upon others. But then do we truly
humble our selves before God, when we search
our own Hearts and Ways, when we confess our
own Sins, with all the grief of Heart and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Face that belongs to us for them; with
the firmest Resolutions, and the most Solemn
Vows of forsaking them. And that we may the
better be directed to make a severe Enquiry, let
us reflect a little on the Two Characters in my
Text, and ask our own Hearts, which will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
us truly if the Question is right put, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are we of the small and despised number of
those that are truly Godly and Faithful or not?
Have we a Sense of God dwelling much upon our
Hearts? Is his Fear much before our Eyes? Does
this Principle make us do or forbear many things,
that we would not do or forbear without it? Do
we accustom our selves often to reflect on the
Works and Ways of God? Do we acknowledge
his Providence, depend upon it, and in all things
submit to it? Do we often consider that he sees
and observes all we do, and that he will call us to
give an Account of it at the last Day? Do we often
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101262:12"/>
pour out our Souls before him in earnest Prayer?
Are we so sensible of our Frailty and Misery, that
we cry mightily to God for Mercy and Grace?
Do we often Implore the Assistances of his Holy
Spirit, and bless him for all the good things that
we receive at his Hands? Do we often in our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to him intercede for all Mankind; and more
particularly for the Church and Nation to which
we do belong? Do we in our secret Addresses to the
Throne of Grace, make mention of those whom
God in his merciful Providence has set over us?
Do we implore a Blessing upon their Persons and
Government, upon their Counsels and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings?
Do we upon these Solemn Days join our
Secret Devotions with the Publick Offices? and
are we seriously affected with the State and the
Dangers of our Religion? Do we rejoice in the
Publick Acts of Religious Worship? Do we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in them with our Hearts, as well as with
our Persons? Have we a Witness within us that
can answer all these Questions? or must not
we, to deal truly with our selves, acknowledge
that we are Strangers to them all; and that tho
Religion is a Name of so decent a sound,
that we dare not directly attack it; yet in our
Hearts we wish there were no such thing in the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101262:13"/>
World: we are weary of it, and if we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
throw off the very Name and Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
of it; yet we take care to let all the World
see, that in our Account it is no more than a Name.
If then the much greater part of Mankind live as
if there were no such thing as Religion in all their
Thoughts, unless it be to abuse and profane it.
If the whole course of their Lives shew, that they
have said in their Hearts <hi>That there is no God;</hi> then
we have but too much Reason to cry out, <hi>Help,
Lord, for the Godly man ceaseth.</hi> And alas there is but
too much reason to add, and <hi>the faithful faileth from
among the children of men:</hi> and that the whole Charge
of the Prophet belongs too truly to us,<note place="margin">Hosca 4. 1.</note> 
               <hi>that there is no
mercy, no truth, nor knowledge of God in the land,</hi> while
every Man is ready to cheat and deceive his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
to flatter him with the Shews and Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and perhaps the Oaths and Protestations of
Kindness; while in his Heart he hates him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to undermine him; while Calumny and
Slander are the most common Heads of Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
while no trust can be given to what is said,
and almost as little regard to what is sworn; while
it is one of the Arts of Conversation to affirm things
which are known to be false, and to promise things
which are not intended to be observed; while all these
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101262:13"/>
things are so common among us, Where is that
Truth in the inward Parts which God loves? Where
is the Probity and Fidelity that is practised among
many Heathen Nations, with so Religious a Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
that the very Name of <hi>Christianity</hi> is blasphemed
among them? When the Christians that go from us,
and carry with them those Qualities that they had
learned in these Parts, are for this very reason
thought to have a false Religion, because they are
so impudent in the practises of Falshood and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation.
And while we reproach the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> with the Doctrines of Equivocation, as the
Arts and Disguises of Falshood, the greater part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
our selves practise these things in so bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
a manner, as if they were angry only at the
dressing up and disguising of them, and resolved
to practise a more honest Falshood, would avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
practise that which the others teach us to do
covertly. Ah, if according to the threatning, God
would <hi>cut off all lying Lips,</hi> under what a desolation
should our Cities and Countries, our Courts and
Camps be quickly brought; it would destroy us
faster than Famines, Plagues, or Wars could do.</p>
            <p>And this leads me to the Third part of my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
which is to consider the dangerous and
almost desperate State of a Nation, in which <hi>Godly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101262:14"/>
and Faithful men do fail.</hi> It is dangerous by reason
of the natural Effects that must needs follow on
such a Corruption, besides the Judgments of God
that it must draw down upon a Nation. Where
Men are no more restrained by the Principles of
Religion, they naturally give themselves up to
their Pleasures or Interests: this makes them both
feeble and effeminate, base and treacherous. When
inward Restraints are taken off, Nature must break
out, and undisciplined Appetites and Passions must
work the Dissolution of Society and Government;
especially where Liberty is preserved, and Law bears
sway. Absolute Governments may be restrained
and maintained at the pleasure of a severe Prince:
But a legal and free Government cannot stand long
against an Inundation of Vice and Impiety. So
that here Religion becomes Indispensably necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
even for the Preservation of the Constitution:
For how can Men live long together in any tolerable
Order and Quiet, if neither the Fear of God, nor
the Awe of Man restrains them. The censures of
the Law fall only upon some enormous Crimes, but
the corruption of Mens Morals and Principles, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be reached in a Government that is exactly legal.
Therefore such a Constitution must either be fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Religion, otherwise it must turn feeble and fall
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101262:14"/>
into Decay, and in Fact we see that no free Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was over-run with Tyranny, till the
Minds of the People, by the abuse of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
were corrupted with Sensuality. This blunts
Industry, and raises the Expence beyond the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
which must quickly bring Ruin after it.
The Expence of Vice must be supported with
Extortion and Oppression, Corruption and Bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
The ravenous Men of Pleasure, as they do
little for the Publick, so they think they can never
rob it enough. The Love of the Publick, and of
ones Country, which is the Root of the most ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Actions, of which the Nature of Man is
capable, sinks in a Man dissolved into Pleasure, or
sold to Interest. A noble contempt of Life,
which gives an Heroical Courage, that is the chief
Instrument of the Preservation of a Nation, has
no true Foundation but in Religion. Not to fear
Death, in one that has reason to believe there is a
black Immortality that comes after it, is Madness,
and an unthinking Extravagance, and not a true
and setled Courage. Whereas to him that has a
good Conscience, that trusts in God and serves
him, and that has reason to believe that he shall
be for ever happy in another World, Death cannot
be terrible, but may be thought on, and ventured
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101262:15"/>
on with an undaunted firmness of Mind. The
want of Truth destroys all Confidence and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
among Men, without which Societies are but
as Ropes of Sand. Men can neither trust a false
Man, nor love him; and what strength can there
be in any Government, where there are no Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
for these? It would be too invidious to
bring all these things, that have been said in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
nearer us; and to observe how far they belong
to us. Alas, the Matter is but too plain, and needs
no enlargement. What pains has been taken
among us, to laugh out of our Minds the sense
both of Religion and Vertue? These have long
pass'd for things of the old World, that are now
out of fashion. And it is but too visible, that the
Heat which many shewed some time ago for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
their Religion, flowed from any Principle
rather than Affection to it, or Zeal for it; since
they do now shew so little concern for it, and live
so little suitably to it. Ah, have we our Religion
for no other end, but to be laugh'd at and despised
by some, while it is made by others only matter
of Passion and Faction? Where are the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Vertues of ordinary Heathens? Are Honesty
and Truth, Sobriety and Chastity, Mercy and
Charity, Generosity and good Nature, only so
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101262:15"/>
many splendid Names of Qualities that are to be
admired in the Men of former Ages, while they
are despised in the present? And what can we
think of our selves, when that which is the Root
and Spring of all other Political Vertues, the Love
of our Country, and a Zeal for the Publick, is so
visibly sacrificed to private Interests and Passions?
These things do as certainly dissolve the Strength of
a Nation, as Palsies or Gouts do the Strength of a
Body. But as so universal a Degeneracy does by its
own Operation weaken a Nation, so it draws down
heavy Judgments from Heaven upon it. Every
Man's Indignation against faulty Persons, encreases
in proportion to the Favours that have been
shewed, but despised by the Offenders. The
Judgments of God upon the Jewish Nation, and
upon the Roman Empire, are things so generally
known, that I presume it is not necessary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
much upon them: The Instances of past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
are perhaps at too great a distance from us
to affect us as they ought to do. But in our own
Age, do not we see how God has arisen to <hi>shake
the whole Earth terribly,</hi> and that his Judgments
have been going round the whole Compass of
<hi>Europe,</hi> while we, as if we had been the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
Corner of the World, have indeed heard
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101262:16"/>
of these things, and seen them at a distance, but
have not yet felt them? How many Protestant
Churches have been plucked up by the Roots?
How terribly have many others been shattered and
next to ruined? What Scenes of Blood and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
of Burning and Vastation, have the
<hi>Netherlands,</hi> the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> been now
in a course of twenty Years, with very little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption?
And not to go out of the Precincts
of this Crown, What a Field of Blood, of Death
and Desolation, has <hi>Ireland</hi> been, and alas still is?
And yet all this while none of these dreadful
Things have broke in upon us. We do indeed feel
them a little in our Purses; but ah, how light is
this Burden compared to that which others bear,
whose Persons and Houses, their Estates and
whole Stock, are every day exposed, not only to
the Fury of their Enemies, but even to the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
of those that ought to be their Friends; for
in all Wars it is but too common, that Countries
suffer almost equally from both Sides. And if
one should judg of that easy share of Taxes which
we bear in so terrible a Convulsion of all <hi>Europe,</hi>
by the Prodigality and Luxury, the Gaming, the
Playhouses, and the other extravagant Expences
that are still among us, one would conclude that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101262:16"/>
Men are not much pinched, when there is so much
left for Vanity and Pleasure. A moderate Frugality
would do more than pay Taxes. And when Men
grudg their Religion and their Country, the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
that to it which they had better be without,
tho that were not in the Case, it must be concluded
that they have no great regard for either the one or
the other. But while we see that God's Judgments
are abroad in the Earth, why should we flatter our
selves so far as to think that they should never
come near us? or rather on the other hand, why
should we not conclude, that the seeming partiality
of his Providence hitherto to us-ward, will be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cleared by the severity of his Judgments, when
he shall think fit to let them loose upon us? For
certainly, the longer they are delayed, they will fall
the heavier at the last: If neither the Light we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
nor the Deliverance that has been almost as
miraculously, tho more slowly carried on and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
amongst us, as it was at first given to us; if
neither the Miseries of others, nor our own extream
Dangers; if neither the great Instructions that are
given us, nor the shining Examples that are set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us can reclaim us, but that we will still go on,
and sin with a high hand, then what remains for us
but to cry, <hi>Help Lord, for the godly Man ceaseth, the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101262:17"/>
Faithful fail from among the Children of Men?</hi> The
more reason that we have to apprehend Judgments
from God for our own Sins, we have still the more
reason to redouble our most earnest Prayers to
him, <hi>Help Lord:</hi> If God do not help us, for his
own great Name's-sake, and for the sake of that
small number of Intercessors that we hope are still
among us, the cry of whose Prayers may be more
effectual, than the loud Cries of the multitudes of
Sinners; we see before our Eyes, all that can be
formidable to Men, who have any regard, either to
their Souls or Bodies, to their Estates or their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity;
if God should now withdraw his Help,
and abandon us, there is nothing that the most me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
and afrighted Imagination can set before
us, that can rise up to the Miseries that we shall
most certainly fall under. That small but much-boasted
<hi>Earnest</hi> of <hi>burning upon our Coast</hi> last
Year, was the true Sample of what we may then
look for: Wasting and Destruction must walk over
the Land as a Flood sweeping all before it. And
as we have no defended Cities, nor Passes to stop
the Fury of a enraged Enemies, if they can but
once break in upon us; so the Interest they have to
make this Nation a heap of Ruins, and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Rage with which their Spirits are whetted against
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101262:17"/>
us, and the Fury of their Priests, the Outragious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Souldiery, and above all the Barbarity
of the Counsels that direct them, give us the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainest
grounds of apprehending utter Destruction.
If they have used the Countries of their own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
so as they have done, where there has been nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Faith kept, nor Mercy shewed; then we may
justly apply these words of our Saviour to our
selves, <hi>If these things be done in the green Tree, what
shall be done in the Dry?</hi> If ever God for our Sins
deliver us up to such a devouring Calamity, then
these will be the only happy Men of the Nation,
who are now thought the most impardonable;
for they will quickly fall Sacrifices to the Rage
of their Enemies, and will not endure the lingring
Torment of seeing and feeling the Miseries of their
Country, in which all must perish at last; for late
Instances, but feeble Ones in comparison to
those dismal things that are before us, if those black
Days should come upon us, may have taught those
unnatural Protestants and unnatural Englishmen,
that would be at first insulting upon the Ruin of
their Country, that they would be very soon look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on as the worst of Enemies, if they should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
pretend but to think of preserving the
Religion and the Laws. This is but a small part of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101262:18"/>
that dismal Catastrophe which we must look for,
if God should deal with us as our Sins have deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at his Hands. And are not all these powerful
Arguments to press us to call on God mightily for
his Help? Can we look on tamely when so much
is at Stake? Can we be indifferent, when no less
than the Destruction of our Country, the Loss of
our Religion, and the Ruin of the whole Reformed
Side all <hi>Europe</hi> over, is the Judgment which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
us, if God is not appeased, and his Wrath tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
away by a serious Repentance and a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
without which the utmost fervour of
our Prayers is but the heat of Imagination, and can
signify nothing? The barbarous hatred which we
lie under, from those who pretend to be of the
same Religion with us, is somewhat extraordinary;
but the stupid and unconcerned Indifferency of
those who are, or at least seem to be, with us, is
yet in some respects more amazing, who perhaps
look on all that is doing as if it were other Mens
Work and not their own; as if it were only done
for the Establishing of the Throne of our Princes,
and not for the Preservation and Happiness of the
Nation; and as if the Quarrel were personal and not
national. We have Princes who shew us but too
often how regardless they are of their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101262:18"/>
and how much they consider the Publick:
and who can neither be kept from the Danger nor
the Fatigue of Campagnes; when, to the lasting
Reproach of the Youth of the Nation, so many
choose to loiter it away at Home in Luxury and
Effeminacy, rather than go and learn how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their Country, and shew that they have the
Zeal and Affection for their Religion, their King
and their Country, which becomes their Blood, and
the Rank that they hold in it. They deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
who think that the present Quarrel is any
other than <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> While then all is
struck at, why are not all concerned, since every
Man must bear his share in the Issue? Shall those
that go out in our Armies and Fields; and with all
dutiful Reverence be it said, shall his Majesty alone
carry away the whole Honour of preserving and
saving the Nation? Have we who stay at Home no
Ambition to share with them in it? If we go on
in our Sins, we are fighting against them behind
them, while they have a powerful Enemy in
Head: but if we are Fasting and Praying while
they are Marching and Fighting, there will be in
this a strong Reserve, and a mighty Supply sent to
them. We have on our Side the justest Cause that
ever any Nation engaged in: we have also on our
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101262:19"/>
Side the Sighs of many poor and needy Persons,
who have been made miserable by the Treachery
and Cruelty of our Enemies: So that according to
the words of this <hi>Psalm,</hi> we may hope that <hi>for the
Oppression and Sighing of the Poor and Needy, God will
now arise and set him in safety from him that puffeth at
him.</hi> The Cry of all that Innocent Blood that has
been shed in a course of many Years unjust Wars,
and cruel Persecution, does all stand of our Side.
If then we join to these true Repentance and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Prayers, we may justly hope that they shall be
heard, that <hi>God will arise, lift up his Strength, and come
and save us.</hi> It will be but a very light part of the
War, if we lay upon our selves an Obligation of
offering up every day some Petitions to God with
relation to it, if we raise our Fervor a little higher
once a Week, and if we observe the monthly Fast
with that solemn strictness which becomes so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
an Occasion, this will upon the whole
Matter bear a greater share in our Preservation than
our prophane Libertines can understand. God is a
hearer of Prayer, and this will be <hi>a continuance in
it, and a watching thereunto;</hi> according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's
Phrase, That our Prayers may go up before
God <hi>as Incense,</hi> we must <hi>cleanse our Hearts, and wash
our Hands:</hi> we must <hi>put away from us the evil of our
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101262:19"/>
ways,</hi> and entertain nothing within us, by which
<hi>our Prayers may be hindred:</hi> for <hi>as the effectual fervent
Prayers of the Righteous avail much, so the Prayers of
the Wicked are Sin. If we regard Iniquity in our Hearts,
God will not hear us,</hi> but both we and our Prayers
shall be an Abomination to him.</p>
            <p>Let us then pray, and pray earnestly to God,
that he may go forth with our Fleets and Armies;
and above all, that he may direct and bless, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and restore to us him that is <hi>the Light of our
Eyes, and the Breath of our Nostrils,</hi> the only visible
Support, not only of these Nations, but of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Liberty in general: and that has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
been in so peculiar a manner the care of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
that nothing but our Sins can make us doubt
but that Angels will still encamp about him, and
watch over him. Let us also pray, that the Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his Crown and Throne may have the same
gracious Protection hovering over Her, enlightning
and prospering all her Counsels; and that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Separation that our common Preservation
makes necessary, may be of a short continuance,
and have a glorious Conclusion; that this our Fast
may end in Days of Joy and Thanksgiving, that
we may be quiet and safe at Home, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
glorious and victorious Abroad; that instead
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101262:20"/>
of Wars, and Rumours of Wars, which do so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
endanger that Life, which is the best part of
ours, we may see those desirable and happy Days,
in which according to the prophetick Phrase, <hi>The
Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 11. 6.</note> 
               <hi>and the Leopard shall
lie down with the Kid; and the Calf and the young Lion
shall lie down together, and a little Child shall lead them.</hi>
That so our Princes being no more distracted with
the more pressing and necessary Care of our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
may be able to attend more entirely to
that which they do so earnestly desire, the raising
up the true Lustre of this Church and State, by
reviving all those Vertues which were the Ancient
Glories of this Nation; and reforming all those
Abuses and Disorders which the Luxury of latter
Times have let in among us. May They live and
prosper, and may every Year be a new Scene of
Glory to Them, an Encrease of Triumph, and a
Progress of Victory, and let all the People say,
<hi>Amen.</hi>
