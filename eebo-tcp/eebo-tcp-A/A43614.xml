            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If therefore I present you
with such a Method for the

till now you never heard

            <p>On <hi>Tuesday</hi> the third of
<hi>Iune</hi> last a Gentleman
sending for his usual Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary,<note place="margin">Iune 3.</note>
acquainted him
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108124:6"/>
that he had got cold (as he
conceived) by leaving off
some clothes, and desired
something that might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
him to sweat, hoping
thereby his distemper might
be removed, as formerly, in
in like cases, he had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced.
The Apothecary
being willing to serve his
friend, and understanding
he was very costive, advised
him to admit of a familiar
Clyster in the afternoon,
and to bedward he should
be furnished according to
his desire; whereupon an
ordinary Clyster was given,
which moved twice, and at
night this Draught—<hi>Rec.

               <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vi. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
morning he fell into
a breathing sweat, and
found much ease; but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that more stools
would do him the more
good, he took (of his own
accord) some Infusion of
Damask-Roses in Whey,
and had two motions more.
That afternoon he sent for
the Apothecary again,<note place="margin">Iune 4.</note> told
him that he was somewhat
better, but withal desired
to have what he further
judged proper in that case;
who presently perceiving
that the Small Pox were
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108124:7"/>
coming forth very fast,
wished him to go into bed,
and send for a Physitian; to
both which motions of his
the Patient forthwith yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and did accordingly:
I must here only tell you,
that the Gentleman was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
39 or 40 years of age,
of a good (save somewhat
inclining to a full) habit
of body; very temperate
he was, one that used much
and moderate exercise in
overseeing his great store
of business: In short, his
constitution, before this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper,
came as nigh to
that they call <hi>Temper amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

implore your Judgment
in; and to it shall only
add, That there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
decay of strength,
nor bad symptomes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant,
other than are
before spoke of, which
I humbly conceive are not
so horrid as in the foresaid
disease (at such an Age)
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108124:10"/>
Physitians very familiarly
meet with in their practice.</p>
            <p>I should here, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, have
put a period to your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
trouble, but that I
have a scruple or two more
to propose to you; the first
is, concerning something
that was done before the
Physitian came; and the
next will be a <hi>Quaere</hi> or
two, concerning what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penned
after.</p>
            <p>Much blame there was
laid upon procuring of
Stools by the <hi>Clyster,</hi> and
Infusion, because purging in
this case cannot but be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
as well as Bleeding
or Vomiting; witness all
the good-wives in a whole
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108124:11"/>
Countrey: What wonder
then if the Doctor's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts
failed, when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
was so strangely Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick'd
er'e he came at him?</p>
            <p>It is not my design to vex
you with craving satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to all the questions
which are put about
Bleeding, Purging, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Vomiting in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
(the Judgment of all
the Learned Physitians,
whose Practice I ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd
with, hath fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
me, that it is possible
for Indications to be so
strong as that all three may
by a skilful Artist be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
profitably used,) but
I pray, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, tell me whether
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108124:11"/>
such Purging, at such a
time, and in such a case as
this, could be indeed so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hurtful?</p>
            <p>He had about four
Stools in those two days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Pox appeared, and
one in about fourty hours
after, throughout his whole
sickness; now what great
injury that could do is in
my opinion as hard to be
imagined, as what good it
did, or might have done, is
obvious. However I think it
may be question'd, whether
those Stools (if they did
any harm) were not more
occasioned by the great
quantity of <hi>Narcotiques,</hi>
than by the <hi>Clyster,</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108124:12"/>
as we shall hear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
from the Learned <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curialis?</hi>
And the same
may be proposed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sleep; it seeming ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
to me, that he must have
rested better if the Pox had
been thrown out, than he
possibly could with all this
<hi>Diacodium,</hi> which kept that
within his body which must
inevitably cause all manner
of bad symptomes; and if
<hi>Sanctorius</hi> made his obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
aright, this cannot
be otherwise, it being one
of his<note n="e" place="margin">Stat. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicin. Sect. 4. Aph. 10.</note> Aphorisms, That

            <p>NOthing but Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
can excuse my
medling with a Province
that has been already by
you so perfectly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred:
It being as much as
to say, to offer to water the
Sea, or light a Candle to
the Sun. Indeed you, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
forestalled the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
have saved me the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of speaking any thing
to the purpose; so that no
impertinence of mine can
want a colourable plea, I
being enjoyned to deliver
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:108124:33"/>
my opinion, and yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
left me to discourse
on. Otherwise though it
be justly questioned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Hippocrates, Galen,</hi> and
the rest of the truly anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
had any explicite
knowledge of the Small
Pox and Measles; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Nurses and old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
do pretend to speak
Aphorismes of them, and
to be able to cure them as
dextrously as the best Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians,
I might make bold
to put in with that crowd,
and venture my rude and
crude conceptions of this
subject amongst the true
<hi>Idiotae,</hi> the vulgar of the
vulgar. And, I know not
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:108124:33"/>
by what fate, Physitians of
late have more lost their
credit in these diseases then
ever: witness the severe
judgment of the world in
the cases of the Duke of
<hi>Gloucester</hi> and the <hi>Princess
Royal;</hi> so that now they
stick not to say, with your
<hi>Agrippa,</hi> that at least in
these a Physitian is more
dangerous then the mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
And I wish this late
scandal by you related
have not strongly helped
to confirm them in their
misprision. Neither the
shortness of my reading
and memory, nor the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of my Library will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
me to deal in Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:108124:34"/>
so plentifully as you
have done, nor is it your
desire: I shall therefore
only follow your Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and briefly and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deliver my thoughts
concerning the method
that was observed in the
cure by you related, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
my self more by my
own small reason, and the
experience of these latter
Ages, then by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Ancients, who
seem in no diseases so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
and imperfect as in
these.</p>
            <p>As to my opinion of the
Doctors Prescripts, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
truth forces me to say,
that they are extreamly
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108124:34"/>
confused; a meer <hi>Chaos</hi> of
Medicines, immethodically
thrown together: <hi>Frigida
ubi certant calidis, humentia
siccis, Mollia cum duris, sine
pondere habentia pondus.</hi> For
cooling you have, <hi>Aqu. pap.
lactuc. frag. ros. dam. diacod.</hi>
for heating, <hi>Alkermes,</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
bridled by the
coolers, for fear it should
do good; and, that they
may want nothing, there is
<hi>Syr. Violar.</hi> for a purger.
For the rest, I shall Answer
according to your <hi>Quaeries</hi>
particularly.</p>
            <p>First, You demand whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Variolarum eruptio</hi> be
not a critical motion of
Nature, and therefore to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:108124:35"/>
be promoted, not hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
I answer in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative;
and if I erre in
this, I think I erre with all
mankind; I am sure, with
all that I ever heard or
read: What can it be less,
when it is evidently that
evacuation by which, if it
rightly proceeds, Nature
constantly terminates the
disease, and clears the mass
of blood in its malign pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tredinous
ferment, and
without which it never fails
to sink into ruine?</p>
            <p>The next <hi>Quaere</hi> conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
to this is about the
use of <hi>Diacodion</hi> in this
case: Truly, though I am
so far convinc'd by <hi>Plater</hi>'s
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:108124:35"/>
arguments, and experience,
that I cannot wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
it, because, at least
with other Medicines, it
provokes sweat egregious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
yet this I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it does not as proper
sudorifiques do, by its heat
and tenuity of parts, but
by accident; that is, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by giving truee to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in easing pain, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
sleep, by which the
spirits are recruited, and so
better enabled to separate
and throw off the matter
by the pores; partly by u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting
and concentring the
same spirits, and, not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
by stopping all other
evacuations, as Purging,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:108124:36"/>
Vomiting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> besides that,
it is a known and confessed
truth, That sleep it self,
which it procureth, <hi>quâ</hi>
sleep, hinders all other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations
but those by the
skin; only transpiration
and sweat it increases.</p>
            <p>This is certain, that <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codion</hi>
does extreamly
thicken, and, as it were,
quag the humours; and
this appears, first by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence,
and <hi>modus sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiae;</hi>
for it is Mucilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and Unctuous, next to
Emplastick: Secondly,
from its use amongst all
men; hence it is given in
suffocative Catarrhes, and
all manner of violent Flux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:108124:36"/>
where the indication is
to condense an over-thin
and turgent humour. You
have very learnedly and
largely proved, That all
the Ancients, (you might
have added, all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns
that are in their
wits) never use it but spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly,
and <hi>urgente sympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
plusquam morbo:</hi> but
here, by your relation, was
no such necessity, no ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
to a <hi>Delirium</hi> or
<hi>Phrenitis,</hi> no intense Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
but his eruptions at
first kindly and hopefull,
only that he did not, it
seems, sleep altogether so
soundly as when he was in
health. And though I
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108124:37"/>
commend not the Doctor's
giving six drachms of it, at
the beginning, upon so
small an account, yet it
might better have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured,
if he had not joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it in Commission with
other vehement coolers,
which yet more restrained
and praecipitated that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
and depurative e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition
and fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by which Nature is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
first to separate, and
then to exclude the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
humour: Nay, though
that might be excused, yet
after that, to make it his
Patients constant diet for
some days together, and
that in those extravagant
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:108124:37"/>
doses, I cannot imagine
from whom he should learn
it, unless from the Turks,
when he was at <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople;</hi>
and they, you know,
make <hi>Opium, Diacodions</hi>
elder brother, their daily
bread.</p>
            <p>As to your next <hi>Quaere,</hi>
of the use of Wine in this
Fever, I find all that I meet
afraid of it, because it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases
the Fever, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
the ebullition too
much, and withal drives
the humours and vapours
to the head, to the great
endangering of a furious
<hi>Delirium</hi> or <hi>Phrenitis,</hi> to
which this disease is very
subject, it being its most
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:108124:38"/>
usual <hi>Catastrophe,</hi> when it
proves fatal. Those that
speak most favourably of
it, do rather indulge than
commend it, and that, as you
judiciously observe, only
after the eruption, very
small wine, and very little
of it, much diluted, and
that too most in respect of
the custom of the Patient,
according to that Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism
in <hi>Hippocrates, Consueta
licèt paulò deteriora meliori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
non consuetis minùs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesta
sunt.</hi> Nor is your
conjecture improbable, that
Wine, partly by its proper
narcotickness, and partly
by its thinness of parts,
serving it insted of a <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle,</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:108124:38"/>
may make <hi>Diacodion</hi>
more stupefying then it is
by its self; and possibly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that account the old
<hi>Athenians</hi> poisoned their
condemned persons with
Hemlock mixed with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Wine; though on the
other side Authors report,
that good store of Wine is
Hemlocks proper Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote:
But we will not
blame the Doctor for this,
seeing it was his principal
scope to stupefy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
rest.</p>
            <p>As to your <hi>Quaere</hi> of this
Oyl of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> (I hope he
meant the Spirit, for there
is great difference) I cannot
believe <hi>Caneparius</hi> that <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108124:39"/>
virioli acidus</hi> doth
cause sleep: If that were so,
it would be seen every day,
its use being so ordinary;
and, I could never see any
thing in practise to favour
such a conceit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Perhaps
<hi>Caneparius</hi> (and, you know,
Chymists love to speak my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically)
means <hi>Extractum
Vit. Narcoticum,</hi> or <hi>Sulphur
Vit. Narcoticum,</hi> or the like
preparations of it; Nor do
I think the Doctor so much
a Chymist as to adde this
Spirit for a corrector of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium;</hi>
I suspect him of no
such subtilty, nor possibly
would so rude and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
a mixture be able to do
it: However, if that were
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:108124:39"/>
his design, he may thank
himself that his Patient ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
slept quietly till he slept
his last; for, it seems, by this
he so over-corrected his
<hi>Narcotique,</hi> that he totally
disarmed it, and pulled
down with one hand what
he built with the other. Nor
can I absolutely prohibit
the use of Acid things in
this Feaver, because, as
<hi>Willis</hi> saith, they coagulate
the blood; for, if so, how
could they be permitted in
other pestilent Feavers,
which all, as well as this, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon coagulation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to him; and what
more ordinary in those fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
then the use of Acids,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:108124:40"/>
as <hi>Succus, Limon. Citri, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>julae,
Aurant: Spiritus Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trion,</hi>
&amp;c. Nay, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with great success uses
<hi>Spiritus Corn: cerv.</hi> Nay, if
Acids produced this sad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
they would not be
safe in any kind of Feaver,
no not in state of health.
Nor doth his experiment
evince, that, because these
Acid Spirits being poured
upon blood reaking hot,
and newly taken from the
vein, do produce first an
Ebullition, then a Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of it, therefore they
must have the same opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon the mass of
blood, being taken inward;
for, as <hi>Helmont</hi> pertinently
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:108124:40"/>
observes, they come to the
blood much broken and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by the concoctions
and ferments of the parts
that they pass through in
their long journey. Nor
do I, with the Chymists,
deifie these Acid spirits
and Liquors though on the
other side, I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
my self to believe
what <hi>Galen,</hi> and the rest,
say contrary to all experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and themselves, that
the stronger <hi>Oxymel</hi> doth
(as you cite them) as it
were curdle the <hi>Serum san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinis,</hi>
and render it viscous
and tenacious; for besides
that <hi>Oxymel</hi> is reckoned by
themselves, and all men, a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108124:41"/>
great incider and attenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(which is just contrary
to curdling) if it had that
faculty, both they and we
were made to give it in <hi>Asth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's</hi>
and other stuffings of
the Lungs by tough hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
besides all contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
obstructions of the
<hi>Viscera,</hi> which I conceive
depend upon nothing else
but viscous and coagulated
<hi>serum.</hi> Nay more, we see
Vinegar not to coagulate,
but to attenuate <hi>serum</hi> out
of the body; we see how
it dissolves other viscous
bodies, as the most tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
gummes that are:
Nay more, how it and its
Spirit dissolve the hardest
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108124:41"/>
stones, and other cognate
Acid Liquors, as <hi>Spiritus
salis, Nitri, Aq: Reg: Fort:</hi>
&amp;c. open and dissolve the
closest metals: Yet I do
not deny, but that over
much Acidity by accident
may thicken the <hi>serum</hi> and
phlegm, that is, by streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
of the Lungs, so oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioning
the retention of
it so long, that by the heat
of the part it is made thick
and viscous. In summe,
my quarrel to the use of
Spirit of <hi>vitriol</hi> in this great
quantity is, That being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to cool Liquors, by its
pierceingness and subtilty
of parts it renders them far
more cooling, and withal,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:108124:42"/>
by its astringency (which is
eminent in <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and
more or less in all Acids)
it beats down and praecipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
that defaecative fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
of the blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
hinders Expectorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is so necessary
in this Disease, the Lungs
being here always much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
and afflicted, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the <hi>dyspnoea</hi> almost
always accompanying it,
and the Cough which for
the most part doth both at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it, and long survive
it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not neglecting your
other Exceptions against
it, as its galling and exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerating
the stomach, Guts,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:108124:42"/>
and other parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but
passing them over as by you
pre-occupied.</p>
            <p>No wonder then if they
flatted and sunk in, I mean
the Pox, and the matter
running to the head, there
insued first <hi>deliria,</hi> and then
death, there being so much
industry used by <hi>Narco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
Coolers,</hi> and <hi>Stypticks,</hi>
to thicken the humours, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
the perfective Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition,
and bind in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
the only way to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Eruption; No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
I say, that the humours
thus retained caused first
continued watching, then
<hi>Deliria</hi> or <hi>Phrensy,</hi> &amp;c. Nor
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:108124:43"/>
can he clear himself by
charging it upon the <hi>Clyst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi>
for, in the time of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition,
clysters are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
and used by all
men, both to keep the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
from immoderate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing,
and to rid away
part of the matter, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
may be the better able
to expel the rest; besides
that, it is Natures proper
Method; for we see, for
the most part, this Feaver
begins with Vomiting,
Stools, or both, which, if
they cease before the Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
make the Disease
the shorter and easier, and
the Pox the fewer. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108124:43"/>
if this Clyster, or the
Patients own Purge of
Whey and Roses, had done
this mischief, it must have
been by causing a loosness
(which never insued)
and the Pox would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after have flatted,
not at so great a distance of
time, whereas then they
came out pretty well, and
never sunk in till the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
had for some days tried
his experiments on him.</p>
            <p>Thus I have furnished
you with <hi>Narcotick Bum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fodder,</hi>
fit to be preferred
to the same Physical place
that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Doctors Prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
richly deserve: I must
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:108124:44"/>
plead a just excuse from
your command, and my
own, and your want of
time; and rest</p>
            <closer>
               <signed>Your affectionate and
devoted Brother.</signed>
