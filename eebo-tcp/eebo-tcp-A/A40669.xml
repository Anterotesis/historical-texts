            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I observe the severall alterations in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
I find foure principall actours on the
theatres of great Families; the Beginner,
Advancer, Continuer, and Ruiner. The
Beginner is he who by his vertues refineth
himself from the drosse of the vulgar, and layeth the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of his house: An excellent workman indeed, as who
not onely bringeth his tools, but maketh his materials. The
Advancer, who improveth the patrimonie of Honour he
receiveth; and what his Father found glasse and made
crystall, he findeth crystall and maketh it pearl. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuer,
who keepeth his Nobility alive, and passeth it along
neither marring nor mending it; but sendeth it to his Son
as he received it from his Father. The Ruiner, who basely
degenerateth from his Ancestours; so that in him Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
hath runne so farre from its first starting, that it is tired:
and whilest he liveth he is no better then his Grandfathers
tombe; without, carved over with honourable titles; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
full of emptinesse, or what is worse, corruption.</p>
            <p>Now to apply. You cannot be Beginners of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies;
that care was cared for before your nurses were
<pb facs="tcp:94789:4"/>
chosen, or your cradles provided. Your Fathers, though
of late years fixed in a higher Sphear, were bright Starres
long before. None can go on in our English Chronicles,
but they must meet with a <hi>Montagn</hi> and a <hi>Powlet,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in peace in their gowns, or in warre in their armour.
Yea, when I go backward by the streams of your Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Nobilitie, (not to speak of the tributarie brooks of
their matches) I can never find the first fountain; and hope
none shall ever find the last fall. For as for the ruiners of
houses, I should rend that thought out with my heart, if it
should conceive that of you. Nay, let me tell you; if you be
but bare continuers of your Honour, you deceive both the
desires and hopes of your friends. Good is not good when
proceeding from them from whom farre better is expected.
Your youthfull vertues are so promising, that you cannot
come off in your riper age with credit without performing
what may redound to the advancing of the honour of your
family, and without building your houses one storie higher
in the English Historie.</p>
            <p>Now know, next Religion, there is nothing accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a man more then Learning. Learning in a Lord is as a
diamond in gold. And if you fear to hurt your tender hands
with thornie School-questions, there is no danger in
meddling with History, which is a velvet-study, &amp; recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-work.
VVhat a pitie is it to see a proper Gentleman to
have such a crick in his neck that he cannot look backward!
yet no better is he who cannot see behind him the actions
which long since were performed. History maketh a yong
man to be old, without either wrinkles or gray hairs; privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
him with the experience of age, without either the
<pb facs="tcp:94789:4"/>
infirmities or inconveniences thereof. Yea, it not onely
maketh things past, present; but inableth one to make a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
conjecture of things to come. For this world afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no new accidents, but in the same sense wherein we
call it <hi>a new Moon,</hi> which is the old one in another shape,
and yet no other then what had been formerly. Old acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
return again, furbished over with some new and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
circumstances.</p>
            <p>Now amongst all particular histories (I may say) none
is more generall then this of the Holy warre, which now I
present to your Honours. Some will condemn me for an ill
husband, in lavishing two Noble Patrones in one book,
whereas one of them might have served to have patroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
many volumes. But first, I did it in the weak expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of my thankfulness unto you, being deeply indebted to
you both; and I thought it dishonestie to pay all to one
creditour and none to another: and therefore conceived it
best, to share my estate joyntly betwixt you, as farre forth
as it would extend. Secondly, considering the weaknesse
of this VVork, now being to walk abroad in the world, I
thought it must be led by both arms, and needed a double
supporter. And now I am sure this Holy warre, which
was unhappie heretofore, when acted; will be happie
hereafter, now written and related, because dedicated to
your Honours. So resteth</p>

charged the margin with the Authours names, it is either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the storie is authour for itself (I mean, generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
or to avoyd the often citing of the same place. Where I
could not go abroad myself, there I have taken air at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and have cited Authours on others citations; yet so that the

            <p>If the Reader may reap in few houres what cost me more

in justice to hasten their destruction, and to gather the nation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Then was the temple it self made a sacrifice, and burnt to ashes;
and of that stately structure which drew the Apostles admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

and to enrage the Jews, did engrave swine over the gates
of the city: Who storming at the profanation of their land,
brake into open rebellion, but were subdued by Julius Severus
the Emperours lieutenant, an experienced captain, and many
thousands slain, with Bencochab their counterfeit Messias (for
so he termed himself) that is, the <hi>sonne of a star,</hi> usurping that
prophesie,<note n="*" place="margin">Num. 24. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Out of Iacob shall a star arise;</hi> though he proved
but a fading comet, whose blazing portended the ruine of that
nation. The captives, by order from Adrian, were transported
into Spain; the countrey laid waste, which parted with her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and fruitfulnesse both together. Indeed pilgrims to this day
here and there light on parcels of rich ground in Palestine:
which God may seem to have left, that men may tast the former
sweetnesse of the land, before it was sowred for the peoples
sinnes; and that they may guesse the goodnesse of the cloth by
the finenesse of the shreds. But it is barren for the generality: the
streams of milk and hony wherewith once it flowed, are now
drained dry; and the<note n="*" place="margin">Sand. Trav. fol. 145.</note> whole face of the land looketh sad, not so
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94789:10"/>
much for want of dressing, as because God hath frowned on it.
Yet great was the oversight of Adrian, thus totally to unpeople
a province, and to bequeath it to foxes and leopards. Though
his memory was excellent, yet here he forgot the old Romanes
rule, who to prevent desolations, where they rooted out the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
planted in colonies of their own people. And surely the
countrey recovered not a competency of inhabitants for some
hundred years after. For though many pilgrimes came thither
in after-ages, yet they came rather to visit then to dwell: and
such as remained there, most embracing single lives, were no
breeders for posterity. If any say that Adrian did wilfully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
this land, and prostitute it to ruine for the rebellion of the
people; yet all account it small policy in him, in punishing the
Jews to hurt his own Empire, and by this vastation to leave fair
and clear footing for forrein enemies to fasten on this countrey,
and from thence to invade the neighbouring dominions: as after
the Persians and Saracens easily overran and dispeopled Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine;
and no wonder if a thin medow were quickly mown.
But to return to the Jews; Such straglers of them, not conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in number, as escaped this banishment into Spain (for few
hands reap so clean as to leave no gleanings) were forbidden to
enter into Jerusalem, or so much as to behold it from any rise
or advantage of ground.<note n="*" place="margin">Hieron. tom. 6. pag. 256.</note> Yet they obtained of the after-Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
once a year (namely on the tenth of August, whereon
their citie was taken) to go in and bewail the destruction of their
temple and people, bargaining with the souldiers who waited
on them, to give so much for so long abiding there; and if they
exceeded the time they conditioned for, they must stretch their
purses to a higher rate: So that (as S. Hierome noteth) they who
bought Christs bloud, were then glad to buy their own tears.</p>

converteth to his profit. Some are of opinion of the generall
calling of the Jews: and no doubt those who dissent from them
in their judgements, concur in their wishes and desires. Yet are
there three grand hinderances of their conversion: First, the
offence taken and given by the Papists among whom they live,
by their worshipping of images, the Jews being zelots in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
commandment: Secondly, because on their conversion
they must<note n="*" place="margin">P. Heylin, Microcos. in Palestine, pag. 570.</note> renounce all their goods as ill gotten; and they will

                  </argument>
                  <p>BUt the sinnes of the Eastern countreys, and chiefly their
damnable heresies, hastened Gods judgements upon them.
In these Western parts, heresies like an angle caught single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
which in Asia, like a drag-net, took whole provinces.
The stayed and settled wits of Europe were not easily removed
out of the old rode and tract of religion, whiles the active and
nimble heads of the East were more desirous of novelties, more
cunning to invent distinctions to cozen themselves with, more
fluent in language to expresse their conceits, as alwayes errours
grow the fastest in hot brains. Hence it came to passe, that Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chites,
Maronites, Nestorians, Eutycheans, Jacobites, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread
these parts, maintaining their pestilent tenents with all
obstinacy, which is that dead flesh which maketh the green
wound of an errour fester by degrees into the old sore of an
heresie. Then was it just with God to suffer them who would
not be convinced with Christian Councels, to be subdued by
the Pagans sword: For though Chosroes had not long a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
government in Palestine, but as a land-floud came and went
away quickly; yet the Saracens who shortly followed, as stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
water drowned all for a long continuance.<note n="*" place="margin">Tyrius. bell. sacr. l. 1. pag. 2.</note> These under
Haumer Prince of Arabia,<note place="margin">636.</note> took Jerusalem, conquered Syria,
and propagated the doctrine of Mahomet round about.</p>
                  <p>It may justly seem admirable how that senselesse religion
should gain so much ground on Christianity; especially having
neither reall substance in her doctrine, nor winning behaviour
in her ceremonies to allure professours. For what is it but the
scumme of Judaisme and Paganisme sod together, and here and
there strewed over with a spice of Christianity? As Mahomets
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94789:14"/>
tomb, so many sentences in his Alcoran seem to hang by some
secret loadstone, which draweth together their gaping inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendences
with a mysticall coherence, or otherwise they are
flat non-sense. Yet this wonder of the spreading of this leprosie
is lessened, if we consider that besides the generall causes of the
growing of all errors (namely the gangrene-like nature of evil,
and the justice of God to deliver them over to believe lies who
will not obey the truth) Mahometanisme hath raised it self to
this height by some peculiar advantages: First, by permitting
much carnall liberty to the professours (as having many wives)
and no wonder if they get fish enough, that use that bait: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
by promising a paradise of sensuall pleasure hereafter,
wherewith flesh and bloud is more affected (as falling under
her experience) then with hope of any spirituall delights:
Thirdly, by prohibiting of disputes, and suppressing of all
learning; and thus Mahomet made his shop dark on purpose,
that he might vent any wares: Lastly, this religion had never
made her own passage so fast and so farre, if the sword had not
cut the way before her, as commonly the conquered follow for
the most part the religion of the conquerours. By this means
that cursed doctrine hath so improved it self, that it may outvie
with professours the Church of Rome, which boasteth so much
of her latitude and extent, though from thence to inferre that
her faith is the best, is falsely to conclude the finenesse of the
cloth from the largenesse of the measure.</p>
                  <p>Now the condition of the Christians under these Saracens
was as uncertain as April-weather. Sometimes they enjoyed
the liberty and publick exercise of their religion: and to give the
Mahometans their due, they are generally good fellows in this
point, and Christians among them may keep their consciences
free, if their tongues be fettered not to oppose the doctrine of
Mahomet. Sometimes they were under fierce and cruell afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
their Bishops and Ministers forced to fly from their places
were kept very poore, as alwayes the Clergy under persecution
count that God gives them living enough, when he gives them
their lives.<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. cap. 5.</note> Tyrius mentioneth one memorable massacre,
which they narrowly escaped. For a spitefull and malicious
Saracen had secretly defiled one of their Mosques in Jerusalem;
which deed being imputed to the poore Christians, they were
all presently dragged to the place of execution to be put to
death, when behold a young man, a zealous Christian, by an
officious lie (the most lawfull of all unlawfull things) confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
himself alone to be guilty of the fact, and so being killed
by exquisite torments, saved the lives of many innocents. In
memory of which act, the Christians in Jerusalem kept a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
solemnity, and once a year triumphantly marched with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94789:14"/>
palms in their hands into the city, to perpetuate the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of this deliverance. The longest vacation from persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they enjoyed, was when<note n="*" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 1. cap. 3.</note> Charles was Emperour of the
West,<note place="margin">800.</note> surnamed the Great: a surname which he did not steal,
but justly win and deserve; not like Pompey, who got the title
of the Great,<note place="margin">Suetonius, in Caesare.</note> though as Cesar observed he gained his chief fame
for martial feats, by conquering the weak and cowardly Bithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.
But this Charles, loved of his friends, feared of his foes,
subdued the strong and lusty Lombards: yet did he not Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity
more good by his war, then by his peace concluded with
Aaron Emperour of the Saracens, under whom the Christians
in Palestine obtained many priviledges and much prosperity;
though this weather was too fair to last long.</p>

though not their condition, being subdued by the
Turks. It will be worth our and the Readers pains to enquire
into the originall of this nation, especially because (as the river
Nitus) they are famous and well known for their overflowing
stream, though hidden and obscure for their fountain. Whence
they first came authours onely do agree in disagreeing: but most
probable it is out of Scythia,<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. ult.</note> Pomponius Mela reckoning
them among the inhabitants of that countrey nigh the river
Tanais. This Scythia (since called Tartaria) was a virgin-countrey,
never forced by forrein arms: for the Monarchs who
counted themselves conquerours of the world (by a large Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecdoche
taking a sixth part for the whole) never subdued it.
Alexander sent some troups to assault Naura and Gabaza, two
out-counties thereof, as an earnest that the rest of his army
should follow: but hearing how these were welcomed, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
lost his earnest, and disposed of his army otherwise. The
Romane Eagles flew not thus farre, and though heard of, were
never seen here. The reasons that made the Turks leave their
native soyl, was the barrennesse thereof; and therefore the
<note n="*" place="margin">Ovid. 8. Metam.</note> Poet maketh famine (which sometimes travelleth abroad into
other countreys) here to have her constant habitation. And
yet no doubt so vast a countrey would maintain her people, if
the wildnesse thereof were tamed with husbandry: But the
people (scorning that their ground should be better civilized
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94789:15"/>
then themselves) never manure it; and had rather provide their
bread with the sword then with the plough. Other partiall
causes might share in these Turks removall, but the cause of
causes was the justice of God, to suffer this unregarded people
to grow into the terrour of the world for the punishment of
Christians: and we may justly hope, that when the correction
is done, the rod shall be burnt; especially finding already their
force to abate, being at this day stopt with the half-kingdome
of Hungary, who formerly could not be stayed by the whole
Empire of Greece.</p>
                  <p>The first step these Turks took out of their own countrey
was into Turcomania,<note place="margin">Sabell. Aen. 9. lib. 2.</note> a northern part of Armenia,<note place="margin">844.</note> conquered
and so called by them: where they lived like the Scythian No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mades,
alwaies wandring yet alwaies in their way, none claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a propriety in the land as his, all defending the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
therein as theirs.</p>
                  <p>The next step was into Persia, whither they were called to
assist Mahomet the Saracen Sultan against his enemies; where
taking notice of their own strength, the Saracens cowardize,
and the pleasure of Persia,<note place="margin">1030</note> they under Tangrolipix their first
King overcame that large dominion.<note place="margin">Knolles, Tur. hist. pag. 4.</note> Then did the Turks take
upon them the Mahometan religion, and having conquered the
Saracens by their valour, were themselves subdued by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racen
superstition. An accident more memorable because not
easily to be paralleled (excepting King<note n="†" place="margin">2 Chron. 25. 14.</note> Amaziah, who having
taken Edom was took with the idolatry thereof) because con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours
commonly bring their religion into the places they
subdue, and not take it thence.</p>
                  <p>Their third large stride was into Babylon, the Caliph where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they overcame. And shortly after under Cutlu-muses their

themselves, and might have recovered their health by
these contrary poysons expelling each other. But the Grecian

not their own good, till at last the Turks devoured them; as

                     <p>Arguments for the lawfulnesse of the Holy war.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT is stiffely canvased betwixt learned men, whether this war
was lawfull, or not. The reasons for the affirmative are fetcht
either from piety or policy: And of the former sort are these.</p>
                  <p>1. All the earth is Gods land let out to tenants; but Judea
was properly his demesnes, which he kept long in his own hands
for himself and his children. Now though the infidels had since
violently usurped it, yet no prescription of time could prejudice
the title of the King of Heaven, but that now the Christians
might be Gods champions to recover his interest.</p>
                  <p>2. Religion bindeth men to relieve their brethren in distresse,
especially when they implore their help, as now the<note n="†" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 1. cap. 11.</note> Christians
in Syria did; whose intreaties in this case, sounded commands
in the ears of such as were piously disposed.</p>
                  <p>3. The Turks by their blasph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mies and reproches against God
and our Saviour, had disinherited and devested themselves of all
their right to their lands; and the Christians as the next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
heirs, might seize on the forfeiture.</p>
                  <p>4. This war would advance and increase the patrimony of
Religion, by propagating the Gospel, and converting of infidels.
If any object that Religion is not to be beaten into men with the
dint of sword; yet it may be lawfull to open the way by force,
for instruction, catechising, and such other gentle means to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
after.</p>
                  <p>5. The beholding of those sacred places in Palestine would
much heighten the adventurers devotion, and make the most
frozen heart to melt into pious meditations.</p>
                  <p>6.<note n="†" place="margin">Bellarm. lib. 3. de Rom. Pont. cap. 17.</note> This enterprise was furthered by the perswasions of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
godly men, S. Bernard and others. Now though a lying
spirit may delude the prophets of Achab, yet none will be so
uncharitable as to think God would suffer his own Michaiah to
be deceived.</p>
                  <p>7.<note n="†" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> God set his hand to this war, and approved it by many
miracles which he wrought in this expedition, and which are so
confidently and generally reported by credit-worthy writers,
that he himself is a miracle that will not believe them.</p>
                  <p>Neither want there arguments derived from policie.</p>
                  <p>1. Palestine was a parcell of the Romane Empire, though
since won by the Saracens: and though the Emperour of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople
could not recover his right, yet did he alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
his claim, and now (as<note n="†" place="margin">Baronius, tom. 11. pag. 687.</note> appeared by his letters read in the
Placentine Councel) Alexius requested these Princes of the
West to assist him in the recovery thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:94789:17"/>2. A preventive warre grounded on a just fear of an invasion
is lawfull: But such was this holy war. And because most stresse
is laid on this argument, as the main supporter of the cause, we
will examine and prove the parts thereof.</p>
                  <p>Though umbrages and light jealousies created by cowardly
fansies be too narrow to build a fair quarrel on; yet the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of a preventive warre founded on just fear, is warranted
by reason and the practice of all wise nations. In such a case it
is folly to do as countrey-fellows in a fence-school, never ward
a blow till it be past: but it is best to be before-hand with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
lest the medicine come too late for the malady. In such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to play an after-game, is rather a shift then a policy; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
seeing war is a tragedy which alwayes destroyeth the stage
whereon it is acted; it is the most advised way, not to wait for
the enemy, but to seek him out in his own countrey.</p>
                  <p>Now that the Mahometans (under whom the Turks and Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens
are comprehended, differing in nation, agreeing in religion
and spite against Christians) were now justly to be feared, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denyed. So vast was the appetite of their sword, that it
had already devoured Asia, and now reserved Grecia for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
course. The Bosphorus was too narrow a ditch, and the
Empire of Grecia too low an hedge to fence the Pagans out of
West-Christendome: yea, the Saracens had lately wasted
<note n="†" place="margin">Sabell. Eun. 9. lib. 3. pag. 354.</note> Italy, pillaged and burned many Churches near Rome it self,
conquered Spain, inroded Aquitain, and possessed some islands in
the mid-land-sea. The case therefore standing thus, this Holy
warre was both lawfull and necessary: which like unto a sharp
pike in the bosse of a buckler, though it had a mixture of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
yet it was chiefly of a defensive nature, to which all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive
warres are justly reduced.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, this warre would be the sewer of Christendome, and
drain all discords out of it. For active men like mill-stones in
motion, if they have no other grist to grind, will set fire one on
another. Europe at this time surfeited with people, and many
of them were of stirring natures, who counted themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
when they were out of doing; and therefore they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
themselves in mutuall jarres and contentions: But now
this holy warre will make up all breaches, and unite all their
forces against the common foe of Christianity.</p>

are of the contrary opinion, and count this warre both need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
and unlawfull, induced thereunto with these or the like ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
                  <p>1. When the Jews were no longer Gods people, Judea was
no longer Gods land by any peculiar appropiation; but on the
other side, God stamped on that countrey an indeleble character
of desolation, and so scorched it with his anger, that it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
change colour, though Christians should wash it with their
bloud. It is labour in vain therefore for any to endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish
a flourishing Kingdome in a blasted countrey: and let
none ever look to reap any harvest, who sow that land which
God will have to lie fallow.</p>
                  <p>2. Grant the Turks were no better then dogs, yet were they
to be let alone in their own kennel. They and the Saracens their
predecessours, had now enjoyed Palestine four hundred and six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years: prescription long enough to soder the most crackt ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and not onely to corroborate but to create a right. Yea, God
himself may seem herein to allow their title, by suffering them
so long peaceably to enjoy it.</p>
                  <p>3. To Visit those places in Jerusalem (the theatre of so many
mysteries and miracles) was as uselesse as difficult; and might be
superstitious if any went (as it is to be feared too many did) with
placing transcendent holinesse in that place, and with a wooden
devotion to the materiall Crosse. The<note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 28. 6.</note> Angel sent the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
away from looking into the sepulchre, with <hi>He is risen, he is

our affections in Christs grave, but rather to seek him where he
was to be found. At this day a gracious heart maketh every

be worshipped. S. Hilarion<note n="†" place="margin">Hie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from coming thither; for the pains would be above the
profit.</p>
                  <p>4. Lastly, This warre was a quicksand to swallow treasure, and
of a hot digestion to devour valiant men: no good, much evil
came thereby; and the Christians that went out to seek an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

                  <p>IT is enough with some to make it suspicious that there were
some sinister ends in this war, because Gregory the seventh,
otherwise called Hildebrand (and by Luther,<note n="†" place="margin">In his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology.</note> 
                     <hi>Larva diaboli</hi>)
the worst of all that sate in that chair, first began it: but death

though the pretences were pious and plausible, yet no doubt the
thoughts of his Holinesse began where other mens ended, and
he had a privie project beyond the publick designe;</p>
                  <p>First, to reduce the<note n="†" place="margin">Mat. Dress. De bello sac. cited by Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padius Melli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sic. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

their three Patriarchs of Jerusalem, Antioch, and Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and to make the Eastern Church a Chapell of ease to the
Mother Church of Rome.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this warre was the Popes house of Correction,
whither he sent his sturdy and stubborn enemies to be tamed.
Such high-spirited men whom he either feared or suspected, he
condemned to this employment, as to an honourable banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and as Saul being afraid of David sent him to fight against
the Philistines, that so he might fall by their sword; so the Pope
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94789:18"/>
had this cleanly and unsuspected conveyance to<note n="†" place="margin">See Daniel, in Henry the third, p. 14.</note> rid away
those he hated, by sending them against infidels. This appeared
most plainly in the matter of the Emperour himself, whom he
sent from home that so he might rob his house in his absence.
At the beginning of this warre, the Popes temporall power in
Italy was very slender, because the Emperours dominions did
gird him close &amp; hard on all sides: but soon after he grew with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
short time without all measure, and did lurch a castle here,
gain a city there from the Emperour, whiles he was imployed
in Palestine: So that by the time that the Christians had lost all
in Syria, the Emperour had lost all in Italy; his dominions there
being either swallowed up by Peters patrimony, or by private
Princes and upstart free-states, which as so many splinters flew
out of the broken Empire.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hereby the Pope determined on his side the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest
controversie that ever was in Christendome. This was
about the investiture of Bishops, whether the right lay in the
Pope or in secular Princes. Now his Holinesse diverted this
question out of Princes heads, by opening an issue another way;
and gave vent to the activity of their spirits in this martiall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
and in the mean time quietly went away without any
corrivall, concluding the controversie for his own profit.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, he got a masse of money by it. He had the office to
bear the bag, and what was put into it, as contributed to this
action from pious people, and expended but some few drops of

fixed posture, and delight in motion and agitation of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
Yea, France (as being then best at leasure) contributed
more souldiers to this warre then all Christendome besides.
The signall men were, Hugh sirnamed le Grand, brother to the
King of France, Godfrey Duke of Bouillon, Baldwine and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stace
his younger brother, Stephen Earl of Bloys father to Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen
afterwards King of England, Reimund Earl of Tholo use,
Robert Earl of Flanders, Hugh Earl of Saint-Paul, Baldwine de
Burge, with many more; besides of the Clergy, Aimar Bishop
of Puy and Legate to the Pope, and William Bishop of Orange.</p>
                  <p>Germany is slandered to have sent none to this warre at this
first voyage; and that other pilgrims passing through that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
were mocked by the Dutch and called<note n="†" place="margin">Centurist. ex Ursperg. cent. 11. col. 416.</note> fools for their
pains. It is true, the Germane adventurers in number answered
not the largenesse and populousnesse of their countrey: for
Henry the Emperour (a Prince whom the Pope long hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at, and hewed him off at last)<note n="†" place="margin">Pantaleon, De viris Ger. part. 2. p. 139.</note> being desirous to go this
voyage, was tied up at home with civill discords. Yet we find
a competency of souldiers of that nation, besides those under
Godescalcus a Priest, Emmicho the Rhene-grave, and Count
Herman their leaders. But though Germany was backward at
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94789:20"/>
the first, yet afterwards it proved the main Atlas of the warre:
that nation like a heavie bell was long a raising, but being got
up made a loud sound.</p>
                  <p>Italy sent few out of her heart and middle provinces nigh
Rome. The Pope was loth to adventure his darlings into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
those white boyes were to stay at home with his Holinesse
their tender father: Wherefore he<note n="†" place="margin">Daniel, in Will. the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, pag. 49.</note> dispensed with them for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as knowing how to use their help nearer, and to greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
Peters patrimony must as well be looked to, as Christs se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre.
But though the Pope would spend none of his own
fewel, he burnt the best stakes of the Emperours hedge, and
furthered the Imperiall party to consume it self in this tedious
warre. Out of the furthermost parts of Italy, Boemund Prince
of Tarentum, and Tancred his nephew (both of the Normane
seed, though growing on the Apulian soyl) led an army of twelve
thousand men. And Lombardy was also very liberal of her soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
towards this expedition.</p>
                  <p>England (the Popes pack-horse in that age,<note place="margin">Daniel, ut priús.</note> which seldome
rested in the stable, when there was any work to be done) sent
many brave men under Robert Duke of Normandy, brother to
William Rufus; as Beauchamp, and others, whose names are lost.
Neither surely did the Irishmens feet stick in their bogs, though
we find no particular mention of their archievements.</p>
                  <p>Spain had other use for her swords against the Saracens at
home, and therefore sent none of her men abroad. As<note n="†" place="margin">Amilius, De gest. Fran. pag. 109.</note> one saith,
The Spaniards did follow their own Holy warre; a work more
necessary, and no lesse honourable. Thus they acted the same
part, though not on the same stage, with our Pilgrims, as being
also imployed in fight against the infidels.</p>
                  <p>Poland had the same excuse for not much appearing clean
through this warre; because she lieth bordering on the Tartars
in her appendant countrey of Lituania, and therefore was busied
in making good her frontiers. Besides, no wonder if Prussia, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuania,
and Livonia were not up in this service; for it was searee
break of day with them, and the sunne of the Gospel was newly
(if at all) risen in those parts. Yea, Poland was so farre from sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
men hither, that she fetcht them from hence,<note n="†" place="margin">Munster, Cosmog.</note> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
implored the aid of the Teutonick order, who came out
of Palestine to assist her against her enemies.</p>
                  <p>Hungarie might bring filling-stones to this building, but few
foundation or corner-stones, and at this time had no comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of note in this action.</p>
                  <p>Scotland also presenteth us not with any remarkable piece of
service which her men performed in all this warre. It was not
want of devotion, which was hot enough in that coid countrey:
rather we may impute it to want of shipping, that countrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94789:20"/>
little powerfull at sea: or (which is most probable) the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this nation are hidden, as wrapped up in the bundle with
some others; I should guesse under the French, but the intimacy
of those two people is of a farre later date.</p>
                  <p>Denmark and Norway near-acquainted with the Arctick
pole, though they lagged the last, (and may therein be excused
because of the length of the way) were sharers in the honour
of this imployment, and performed good sea-service.</p>
                  <p>Sweden either acted not at all, or else had a very short part in
this businesse. That countrey being a separatist because of her
remote situation, had little communion with other parts of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.
And indeed histories are mute of Sweden, but that of late
Gustavus his victory hath put a tongue into them, and hath made
that countrey famous to all posterity.</p>

                  <p>This was no pleasant prospect to Alexius the Grecian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
to see the sea full of ships, the shore of souldiers. He had
gotten the Empire by bad practices (by deposing and, cloistering
Nicephorus his predecessour) and an ill conscience needeth no
enemy but it self: for now he affrighteth himself with the fansie,
that these Pilgrims were so many pioners come to undermine
him. Yea, he seemeth to have entailed his jealousies on all his
successours; who never cordially affected this warre, but suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that these Western Christians made but a false blow at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
and meant to hit Constantinople. But though he had a
storm in his heart, yet he made all fair weather in his face; and
finding these his guests so strong that they could command
their own welcome, he entertained them rather for fear then
love. At last it was<note n="*" place="margin">M. Paris, pag. 38.</note> covenanted betwixt them, that what coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys

his estate by these adventures; but he (like those who cannot

left them possest of Jerusalem, and the greater part of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria:
but since they have thrived better, and won the lesser Asia
from the Grecian Emperour. Indeed those Emperours with
their own hands lifted up the Turks into their throne, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them thus speedily to conquer. For giving themselves over
to pleasure, they gave little countenance, and lesse maintenance
to men of service and action: whereby the martiall sparks in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
spirits were quenched; and no wonder if virtue did wither
where it was not watered with reward. Secondly, out of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse
the Emperours unfurnished their frontiers of garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and laid them open to invasions; a notorious soloecisme
in policy: for if doores in private houses are to be locked,
much more frontiers in Kingdomes. Neither did it a little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94789:22"/>
Eudoxia a woman, and her children in minority, too weak pilots
to steer so great a State in the tempest of war. And although af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

were not to be excepted against; yet he being totally busied

these being disarmed, had no other weapons then those of the

This city was equally beholden to nature and art for her

called there by Constantine against Arius, wherein were

whereof they made many warlike instruments, and hoped
speedily to conquer the city. But breathed deer are not so
quickly caught. The Turks within being experienced souldiers,
defeated their enterprises. And here one might have seen art
promising her self the victory, and suddenly meeting with
counter-art which mastered her. The lake Ascanius whereon
the city stood, having an out-let into the sea, much advantaged
the besieged, whereby they fetch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

when behold Solyman with all his might fell upon them;
and there followed a cruel battel, fought with much courage
and variety of successe. A cloud of arrows darkned the skie,
which was quickly dissolved into a showre of bloud. The
Christians had many disadvantages: For their enemies were

had been absent all the battel, came in with his army: yet they
wanted a hammer to drive the victory home to the head, having

as he went; and to prop up his credit, gave it out that he had

of pride, did let them bloud with the long and costly siege
of Antiochia. This city watered by the river Orontes, and
called Reblath of the Hebrews, was built by Seleucus Nicanor,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94789:23"/>
and enlarged by Antiochus. Compassed it was with a double
wall, one of square stone, the other of brick; strengthened with
460 towers, and had a castle on the East rather to be admired
then assaulted. Here the professours of our faith were first na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med<note n="†" place="margin">Acts 11. 26.</note>
Christians: and here S. Peter first sate Bishop, whose fair
Church was a Patriarchall seat for many hundred years after.
Before this city the Pilgrimes army incamped,<note place="margin">Octo. 21.</note> and strongly
besieged it: but the Turks within manfully defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under Auxianus their captain, frustrated their hopes of
taking it by force. The siege grew long, and victuals short in
the Christians camp: and now<note n="†" place="margin">Sabell. Enn. 9. lib. 5. pag. 357. Et Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius, in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip the first, pag. 123.</note> Peter the Hermite being
brought to the touch-stone, discovered what base metall he
was of: ran away with some other of good note, and were
fetcht back again, and bound with a new oath to prosecute the
warre. At last, one within the city (though Authours agree
neither of his name nor religion, some making him a Turk,
others a Christian;<note place="margin">1098 Iune 3.</note> Some calling him Pyrrhus, some Hemir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherrus,

city to Boemund. The Christians issuing in, and exasperated
with the length of the fiege, so remembred what they had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
that they forgot what they had to do,<note n="†" place="margin">P. Aemil. pag. 127.</note> killing promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
Christian citizens with Turks. Thus passions like heavie
bodies down steep hills, once in motion move themselves, and
know no ground but the bottom.</p>
                  <p>Antiochia thus taken, was offered to Alexius the Emperour;
but he refused it, suspecting some deceit in the tender; as bad
men measure other mens minds by the crooked rule of their
own. Hereupon it was bestowed on Boemund; though this place
dearly purchased was not long quietly possessed: For Corboran
the Turkish Generall came with a vast army of Persian forces,
and besieged the Christians in the City, so that they were
brought into a great strait betwixt death and death, hunger
within and their foes without. Many secretly stole away,
whereat the rest were no whit discomfited, counting the losse
of cowards to be gain to an army. At last, they generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
rather to lose their lives by whole-sale on the point of
the sword, then to retail them out by famine, which is the
worst of tyrants, and murdereth men in state, whilest they die in
not dying. It did not a little encourage them, that they found
in the church of S. Peter that<note n="†" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 6. cap. 14.</note> lance wherewith our Saviours
body was pierced: They highly prized this military relique
of Christ, as if by wounding of him it had got virtue to
wound his enemies, and counted it a pawn of certain victory.
Whether this spear was truly found, or whether it was but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
to cozen men with, we will not dispute: However, it
wrought much with these Pilgrimes; for conceit oftentimes
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94789:23"/>
doth things above conceit, especially when the imagination ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
something founded in religion. Marching forth in
severall armies they manfully fell upon their enemies, and being
armed with despair to escape,<note place="margin">Iune. 28</note> they sought to fell their lives at
the dearest rate. Valour doth swell when it is crushed betwixt
extremities; and then oftentimes goeth beyond her self in her
atchievements. This day by Gods blessing on their courage
they got a noble conquest. Some saw<note n="†" place="margin">M. Paris, in Gulielmo se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundo pag. 57.</note> S. George in the aire
with an army of white horses fighting for them; but these
no doubt did look through the spectacles of fansie. And yet
though we should reject this apparition, we need not play the
Origens with the story of S. George, and change all the literall
sense into an allegory of Christ and his Church: for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable
that our English nation, amongst so many Saints that

Authours who write this warre so lard their stories, that it will
choke the belief of any discreet man to swallow them. As the
intent of these writers was pious, to gain credit and converts to
the Christian faith, so the prosecuting of their project must be
condemned, in thinking to grace the Gospel in reporting such
absurd falsities. But let us know that heaven hath a pillorie,
whereon <hi>Fraus pia</hi> her self shall be punished: and rather let us

                  <p>The pride of the Turks being abated in this battel, and an
100000 of them being slain, the Christians grew mightily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent,
and forgot to return to God the honour of the victory.
Whereupon followed a great mortality, and 50000 died in few

Europe not being friends with the aire of Asia, till use by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees

for after long fasting they would not measure their

                  <p>PAlestine is bounded on the North with mount Libanus; West
with the mid-land-sea; South, with the wildernesse of Paran,
parting it from Egypt; and East, with the mountains of Gilead,
and the river of Arnon. To give it the most favourable dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
From the foot of Libanus to Beersheba, North and
South, may be allowed 210 miles: and from Ramoth-gilead
to Endor, East and West, seventy; which is the constant breadth
of the countrey. In which compasse in Davids time were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<note n="†" place="margin">2 Sam. 24. 9.</note> thirteen hundred thousand men, besides women, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and impotent persons: and yet the tribes of<note n="†" place="margin">1 Chron., 21. 6.</note> Benjamin
and Levi were not reckoned. True this must needs be, for truth
hath said it: Yet is it wonderfull. For though the united Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the Low-countreys maintain as many people in as little a
plot of ground, yet they feed not on home-bred food; but have
Poland for their granary, the British ocean for their fish-pond,
High-Germany for their wine-cellar; and by the benefit of their
harbours unlock the store-houses of all other countreys. It fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not thus with the Jews, whose own countrey fed them all.
And yet the seeming impossibility of so many kept in so small a
land will be abated, if we consider these particulars:</p>
                  <p>1. People in those hot countreys had not so hot appetites for
the quantity of the meat eaten, nor gluttonous palates for the
variety of it.</p>
                  <p>2. The countrey rising and falling into hills and vales, gained
many acres of ground: whereof no notice is taken in a map; for
therein all things presented are conceived to be <hi>in plano:</hi> And
so the land was farre roomthier then the scale of miles doth
make it.</p>
                  <p>3. They had pasturage to feed their cattel in, in out-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
beyond Palestine. Thus the tribe of<note n="†" place="margin">1 Chron. 5. 9, 10.</note> Reuben grased their
cattel east-ward, even to the river Euphrates.</p>
                  <p>4. Lastly, the soyl was transcendently fruitfull, as appeareth
by that great<note n="†" place="margin">Num. 13. 23.</note> bunch of grapes carried by two men: For though
many a man hath not been able to bear wine, it is much that one
should be loaden with one cluster of grapes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:94789:24"/>If any object against the fruitfulnesse of this countrey; That
there were many wildernesses therein, as those of Maon, Ziph,
Carmel, Gibeon, Judah, and these must needs cut large thongs
out of so narrow a hide: it is answered, That these wildernesses
took up no great space, as probably being no bigger then our
least forrests in England. As for the greater deserts, we must not
conceive them to lie wholly waste, but that they were but thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inhabited: for we find<note n="*" place="margin">Iosh. 15. 61.</note> fix cities with their villages in the
wildernesse of Judah.</p>
                  <p>Principall commodities of this countrey were,
1. Balm, which<note n="*" place="margin">Munster, in Terra san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta pag. 1017. &amp; in Aegypt. pag. 1135.</note> wholly failed not long after our Saviours
passion; whether because the type was to cease when the truth
was come, or because that land was unworthy to have so sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
bodily physick grow in her, where the Physician of the
soul was put to death.</p>
                  <p>2. Honey, and that either distilled by bees those little chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
(and the pasture they fed on was never a whit the barer for
their biting) or else rained down from heaven, as that which
<note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 14. 27.</note> Jonathan tasted, when his sweet meat had like to have had
sowre sauce, and to have cost him his life.</p>
                  <p>Besides these, milk, oyl, nuts, almonds, dates, figs, olives: So
that we may boldly say, no countrey had better sauce and better
meat, having fowl, fish in sea, lakes, and rivers; flesh of sheep,
goats, bucks, and kine.</p>
                  <p>Mines of gold and silver with pearls and precious stones, Judea
rather had not then wanted; either because God would not have
his people proud or covetous; or because these are not essentiall
to mans life; or because nature bestoweth these commodities in
recompense on barren countreys.</p>
                  <p>Horses they had none but what they bought out of Egypt for
service, using asses for burden, oxen for drawing, and mules for
travel. And for many hundred years they used no horses in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
till David took some from<note n="*" place="margin">2 Sam. 8. 4.</note> Hadadezer. The greatest incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of the land was that it had wild beasts; and their sheep
were not securely folded like ours in England, which stand more
in danger of men then wolves.</p>
                  <p>The chief river of the countrey was Jordan: over which the
Israelites passed on foot; afterwards Elijah made a bridge over
it with his cloke: and our Saviour washed the water hereof, by
being baptized in it. This ariseth from the springs of Jor and
Dan; whence running south he enlargeth himself first into the
waters of Merom, then into the lake of Genesareth or Tiberias;
and hence recovering his stream, as if sensible of his sad fate,
and desirous to deferre what he cannot avoid, he fetcheth many
turnings and windings, but all will not excuse him from falling
into the Dead sea. Authours are very fruitfull on the barrennesse
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94789:25"/>
of this sea, (where Sodome once stood) writing how on the

which touched fall to ashes.</p>

the Nantwich of Palestine, where salt was boyled.
2. Sarepta, where Elijah multiplyed the widows oyl. 3. Tyre,
anciently the royall-Exchange of the world; but of this (as of
Sidon and Ptolemais) largely hereafter. 4. Ephek, whose walls
falling down gave both the death and grave-stones to 27000 of
Benhadads souldiers. 5. Cana the great, whereof was that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
whose daughter Christ dispossessed of a devil. 6. Belus, a

so called (as our Albion) from his snowie top, or from frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
growing thereon.</p>
                  <p>Nepthali with these: 1. Abel-beth-maacha: In this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough

for all his commanding of 900 iron-chariots, was slain with
one iron-nail. 3. Capernaum, where Christ healed the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions
servant, and not farre off fed an army of guests with five
loaves and two fishes: so that if we consider what they ate, vve
may wonder that they left any thing; if what they left, that they

flie that killed men unawares. As for those who formerly privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
Sanctuaries in England, where the worst traitours and
wilfullest murderers were secure from punishment, they rather
propounded Romulus then Moses for their president. 5. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blah,
where King Zedekiah (more unhappy that he saw so long,
then that he was blind so soon) had his eyes put out, after he had
beheld the slaughter of his sonnes. 6. Cesarea-Philippi, the
chief city of Decapolis, which was a small territory on both

sides of Jordan, so called of ten cities it contained; though Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
wonderfully differ in reckoning them up. 7. Christs
mount, so named because it was his pulpit, as the whole Law was
his text, when he made that famous sermon in the mount. This
Sunne of righteousnesse, which had all Palestine for his zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack,
the twelve tribes for his signs, stayed longest here and in
Zabulon; and as S. Hierome<note n="*" place="margin">In 4. Mat.</note> observeth, as these two tribes

in these countreys.</p>
                  <p>Lower Galilee consisted of Zabulon and Issachar. Zabulon
presenteth us with Naim, where our Saviour raised the widows
sonne, so that she was twice a mother, yet had but one child.
2. Cana the lesse, where he shewed the virginity of his miracles
at a marriage, turning water into wine. 3. Bethulia, where Judith
strook off Holofernes his head, though some since have strook
off that story, not onely from canonicall Scripture, but from
truth. 4. Bethsaida, upbraided by Christ, famous for her great
means, great ingratitude, great punishment. 5. Nazareth,
where our Saviour had his conception and education. 6. Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,

7. Mount Carmel, the Jewish Parnassus, where the Prophets

                  <p>Entring on the south-coasts of Simeon, we light on Askelon,
where Herod was born. 2. Gaza, chief of the five Satrapies of
the Philistines, the gates whereof Samson carryed away; and
hither being sent for to make sport in the house of Dagon, acted
such a tragedy that plucked down the stage, slew himself, and
all the spectatours. 3. More inland; Ziklag, assigned by Achish
to David. 4. Beersheba and Gerar, where Abraham and Isaac
lived most constantly, near unto the brook of Besor.</p>
                  <p>The tribe of Judah was the greatest of all, so that Simeon
and Dan did feed on the reversion thereof, and received those ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which originally belonged to this royall tribe. Memorable
herein were 1. Hebron, the land whereof was given to Caleb,
because he and Joshua consented not to the false verdict which
the jurie of spies brought in against the land of Canaan. 2. Nigh,
in the cave of Machpelah, the Patriarchs were buried; whose
bodies took livery and seasin in behalf of their posterity, which
were to possesse the whole land. 3. Kiriath-sepher or Debir,
an ancient University of the Canaanites: for though Parnassus
was onely in Greece, yet the Muses were not confined to that
countrey. 4. Tekoa, where Amos was born, fetcht from the
herdsmen to feed Gods sheep; and to dresse his vine, from ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
wild-figs. 5. Zoar, Lots refuge; near to which his wife
for one fare-well glance at Sodome, was turned into a pillar of
salt, to season us to measure a sinne by the infinitenesse of God
who forbiddeth it. Adjoyning is Lots cave; where he affecting
solitarinesse, had too much company of his own daughters.
6. Carmel, where Nabal lived as rich as foolish; but those
grains of wisdome which were wanting in him, were found
over-weight in his wife. Here Uzziah pastured his cattel: a
King, yet delighted in husbandry; as thrift is the fewel of ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gnificence.
7. Bethlehem, where our Saviour was born. 8. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
whereof afterwards.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of Trachonitis.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE want one adequate word of a countrey to expresse the
tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half-Manasses beyond Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan.
Trachonitis cometh the nearest, so called because it riseth
up in sharp hills, which are known to Ptolomie by the name of
Hippus; to Strabo, of Trachones; but in Scripture, of mount
Hermon, or Gilead.</p>
                  <p>Reuben, though disinherited of the birth-right, had this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of an elder brother, that he was first provided for. His
chief places, Heshbon and Medeba, and Macherus, the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
in-land city in that part of the world. Mount Abarim, a
chain of hills, the highest whereof was Nebo; the top-cliff of
Nebo, Pisgah; whence Moses viewed the land: hereabouts
the Angel buried him, and also buried his grave, lest it should
occasion idolatry. The river Arnon parteth this tribe from
Moab.</p>
                  <p>In Gad, we find Peniel where Jacob wrestled with God; lost
a sinew, but got a blessing: Jabesh-gilead, where Saul was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried:
Ramoth-gilead, where Ahab was slain: Rogelim, the
mannour of Barzillai, superannuated to be a courtier: Maha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naim,
where the Angels appeared to Jacob: The forrest of
Ephraim, where that execution was done by Jephthah on the
Ephraimites, for not pronouncing that heavie aspiration in Shib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boleth:
the river Jabbok.</p>
                  <p>In Manasses, Edrei the city of Og, on whose giant-like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
the Rabbines have more giant-like lies: Gadara, whose
inhabitants loved their swine better then their Saviour. They
that desire to be further informed of Canaan, let them spare
pains to strike fire, and light their candle at Sir Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legh's
torch.</p>

                     <p>The description of the citie of Ierusalem; the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servables
within and about her.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>JErusalem by the often change of her fortunes, hath somewhat
altered her situation, having hitched her self more north-west-ward.
For the mountain of Calvarie, which formerly she
shut out of her gates, as the infamous place of execution, she
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94789:27"/>
now embraceth within her walls as her most venerable monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>On the south of Jerusalem (once part of her, now excluded)
lyeth mount Sion, famous anciently for the palace of David:
On the east, mount Olivet, parted with the vale of Jehoshaphat;
which (some will have) shall be the hall for the great Assizes of
the world at the day of judgement, whilest others more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly
conceive that the place as well as the time is concealed.
On the west, the hill of Gihon: And on the north it is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
plain.</p>
                  <p>The monuments which are still extant to be seen without or
within the city, are reduceable to one of these three ranks,
1. Certainly true; as the mountains compassing it, which are
standards too great and too heavie for either time or warre to
remove: and such also are some eminent particulars of some
places, which constant tradition without rupture hath entailed
on posterity. 2. Of a mixt nature; where the text is true, but
superstition and fansie have commented on it. 3. Stark lies,
without a ragge of probabilitie to hide their shame; where the
believer is as foolish as the inventer impudent. We will bundle
them together, and let the Reader sort them at his discretion:
for it is hard to fit the throats, as to please the palates of men;
and that will choke one mans belief which another will swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
as easily credible. Neither let any censure this discourse as
a parenthesis to this history, seeing that to see these reliques
was one principall motive with many to undertake this pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage.</p>
                  <p>To begin without the city: on the south there remain the
ruines of Davids palace, too near to which was Uriahs house;
and the<note n="*" place="margin">Morisons Trav. part. 1. pag. 226.</note> fountain is still shewed where Bathsheba's washing of
her body occasioned the fouling of her soul. Next, Davids
tomb is to be seen wherein he was buried: his monument was
inriched with a masse of treasure, saith Josephus: out of which
Hircanus 850 years after took three thousand talents. But sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
David who despised riches in his life, was not covetous after
his death: And I am sure they are his own words, that<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 49. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Man
shall carry nothing away with him, neither shall his great pomp follow
him.</hi> Thirdly, Aceldama that burying-place for strangers: and
the grave that every where hath a good stomach, hath here a
<hi>boulimia</hi> or greedy worm; for it will devoure the flesh of a corpse
in 48 hours. Fourthly, Absaloms pillar, which he built to
continue his memory, though he might have saved that cost,
having eternized his infamy by his unnaturall rebellion. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the houses of Annas and Caiaphas, to passe by others of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
note.</p>
                  <p>On the east; First, mount Olivet, from whence our Saviour
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94789:28"/>
took his rise into heaven. The chappel of Ascension, of an eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>square
round mounted on three degrees, still challengeth great
reverence; and there the footsteps of our Saviour are still to be
seen, which cannot be covered over. Secondly, the fig-tree
which Christ cursed: for he who spake many, here wrought a
parable; this whole tree being but the bark, and Christ under it
cursing the fruitlesse profession of the Jews. Thirdly, the place
where S. Stephen was stoned; and the stones thereabouts are
over-grown with a red rust, which is (forsooth) the very bloud
of that holy martyr. Fourthly, the place where Judas surprised
our Saviour, and he fell down on a stone, in which the print of
his elbows and feet are still to be seen. Fifthly, the sepulchre of
the blessed Virgin: whose body after it had been three dayes bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
was carried up by the Angels into heaven; and she let fall
her<note n="*" place="margin">Sandys, pag. 190.</note> girdle to S. Thomas, that his weak faith might be swad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
therewith: otherwise he who in the point of Christs resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
would have no creed, except he made his own articles,
and put his finger into his side, would no doubt hardly have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
the Virgins assumption. With this legend we may cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
another, which though distant in place will be believed both
together: They shew at<note n="*" place="margin">Bidulphs Trav. pag. 130 &amp; Morisons, part. 1. pag. 227.</note> Bethlehem a little hole over the place
where our Saviour was born, through which the starre which
conducted the wise men fell down to the ground. But who will
not conclude but there was a <hi>vertigo</hi> in his head, who first made
a starre subject to the falling-sicknesse? Sixthly, the vale of
Hinnom or Tophet, in which wise Solomon befooled by his
wives, built a temple to Moloch. Seventhly, Cedron, a brook
so often mentioned in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The west and north-sides of Jerusalem were not so happily
planted with sacred monuments; and we find none thereon
which grew to any eminency.</p>
                  <p>We will now lead the Reader into Jerusalem: Where first on
mount Moriah (the place where Isaac was offered, though not
sacrificed) stood Solomons temple, destroyed by the Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
rebuilt by Zorobabel: Afterward Herod reedified it so state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(saith Josephus) that it exceeded Solomons temple; if
his words exceed not the truth. But no wonder if he that never
saw the sunne, dare say that the moon is the most glorious light
in the heavens. Secondly, Solomons palace, which was<note n="*" place="margin">1 King. 7. 1.</note> thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years in building, whereas the temple was finished in
<note n="*" place="margin">1 King. 9. 38.</note> seven: Not that he bestowed more cost and pains (because
more time) on his own then on Gods house:<note n="*" place="margin">Vide Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel. in locum.</note> but rather he plied
Gods work more throughly, and entertained then more build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
so that contrary to the proverb, Church-work went on the
most speedily. Thirdly, the house of the forrest of Lebanon,
which was (as appeareth by comparing the text) fourty cubits
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94789:28"/>
longer, and thirty cubits broader then the temple it self. But
no doubt the holy Spirit speaking of holy buildings, meaneth
the great cubit of the sanctuary; but in other houses, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
or Common cubit. It was called the house Lebanon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hard by it Solomon planted a<note n="†" place="margin">Adricom. ex Hieron. p. 153.</note> grove, the abridgement of
the great forrest; so that the pleasures of spacious Lebanon were
here written in a lesse character. Fourthly, Pilates palace, and
the common hall, where the Judge of the world was condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to death. Fifthly, the pool of Bethesda, the waters whereof
troubled by the Angel, were a <hi>Panpharmacon</hi> to him that first got
into them. Here was a spittle built with five porches, the mercy
of God being seconded by the charity of man; God gave the
cure, men built the harbour for impotent persons. Sixthly, the
house of Dives the rich glutton: and therefore (saith<note n="†" place="margin">Theatr. Terr. sanct. 153.</note> Adrico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius)
it was no parable: But may we not retort his words? It
was a parable, and therefore this is none of Dives his house.

                  <p>But my discourse hasteth to mount Calvary, which at this
day, hath almost ingrossed all reverence to it self. It is called
Calvarie, Golgotha, or the place of a skull, either because the
hill is rolled and<note n="†" place="margin">Illyricus, in 27. Matth.</note> rounded up in the fashion of a mans head, (as
<note n="†" place="margin">Camdens Brit. in But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hamshire.</note> 
                     <hi>Pen</hi> in the Brittish tongue signifieth both an head, and a copped
hill) or because here the bodies of such as were executed were
cast. As for that conceit, that Adams skull should here be found,
it is confuted by S. Hierom, who will have him buried at He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron.
Neither is it likely, if the Jews had a tradition that the
father of mankind had here been interred, that they would have
made his sepulchre their Tiburn where malefactours were put
to death, and the charnel-house where their bones were scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.
Over our Saviours grave stood a stately Church, built
say some by Helen, say others by Constantine: but we will not
set mother and sonne at variance; it might be she built it at his
cost. In this Church are many monuments: As the pillar where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
Christ was bound when scourged, wherein red spots of
dusky-veined marble<note n="†" place="margin">Bridenb. De Domin. sepulcro.</note> usurped the honour to be counted Christs
bloud. Secondly, a great clift in the rock, which was rent in
sunder at the Passion, whereby the bad thief was divided from
Christ, (the sign of his spirituall separation) and they say it
reacheth to the centre of the earth: a thing hard to confute.
Thirdly, certain pillars which being in a dark place under
ground, are said miraculously to weep for our Saviours suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But I referre those who desire the criticismes of those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
without going thither, to read our English travellers: for in
this case, as good wares and far cheaper peny-worths are bought
at the second hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:94789:29"/>To conclude our description of Palestine, let none conceive
that God forgot the Levites in division of the land, because they
had no entire countrey allotted unto them. Their portion was as
large as any, though paid in severall summes: They had 48 ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
with their suburbs, tithes, first-fruits, free-offerings; being
better provided for then many English ministers, who may
preach of hospitality to their people, but cannot go to the cost
to practice their own doctrine.

enemies, yea, and set five thousand of them at liberty, whom
they had taken captive.</p>
                  <p>The Pilgrimes kept their Easter at Tripolie, Whitsuntide by
Cesarea-Stratonis,<note place="margin">April 10.</note> taking many places in their passage; and at
last came to Jerusalem. Discovering the city afarre off, it was
a pretty sight to behold the harmony in the difference of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
their joy;<note place="margin">May 29.</note> how they clothed the same passion with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
gestures; some prostrate, some kneeling, some weeping; all
had much ado to manage so great a gladnesse. Then began they
the siege of the citie on the north,<note place="margin">Iune 6.</note> (being scarce assaultable on
any other side by reason of steep and broken rocks) and
continued it with great valour. On the fourth day after, they
had taken it but for want of scaling-ladders.<note place="margin">Iune 10.</note> But a farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
want was the defect of water, the springs being either stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
up or poysoned by the Turks; so that they fetcht wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<note n="†" place="margin">Aemilius, pag. 135.</note> five miles off. As for the brook Cedron, it was dried
up, as having no subsistence of it self, but meerly depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the benevolence of winter-waters, which mount Olivet
bestoweth upon it. Admirall Coligni was wont to say, He that
will well paint the beast <hi>Warre,</hi> must first begin to shape the
belly; meaning that a good Generall must first provide victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
for an army: Yea, let him remember the bladder in the
beasts belly as well as the guts, and take order for moisture
more especially then for meat it self; thirst in northern bodies
being more unsupportable then famine: Quickly will their
courage be cooled, who have no moisture to cool their hearts.
As for the Christians want of ladders, that was quickly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied:
for the Genoans arriving with a fleet in Palestine, brought
most curious engineers, who framed a wooden tower, and all
other artificiall instruments. For we must not think, that the
world was at a losse for warre-tools before the brood of guns
was hatched: It had the<note n="†" place="margin">Plin. Nat. hist. lib. 7. cap. 56.</note> battering ramme, first found out by
Epeus at the taking of Troy; the <hi>balista</hi> to discharge great
stones, invented by the Phenicians; the <hi>catapulta,</hi> being a sling
of mighty strength, whereof the Syrians were authours: and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94789:30"/>
perchance King<note n="†" place="margin">2 Chron. 26. 15.</note> Uzziah first made it; for we find him very
dextrous and happy in devising such things. And although
these Bear-whelps were but rude and unshaped at the first, yet
art did lick them afterwards, and they got more teeth and
sharper nails by degrees; so that every age set them forth in a
new edition, corrected and amended. But these and many more
voluminous engines (for the ramme alone had an hundred men
to manage it) are now virtually epitomized in the cannon.
And though some may say, that the finding of guns hath been
the losing of many mens lives, yet it will appear that battels
now are fought with more expedition, and victory standeth not
so long a neuter, before she expresse her self on one side or
other.</p>
                  <p>But these gunnes have shot my discourse from the siege of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem:
To return thither again. By this time,<note place="margin">Iuly 11.</note> in the space of
a<note n="†" place="margin">M. Paris, pag. 63.</note> moneth, the Genoans had finished their engines which they
built<note n="†" place="margin">P. Aemilius, pag. 135. &amp; Tyrius, lib. 8. cap. 6.</note> seven miles off: for nearer there grew no stick of bignesse.
I will not say, that since our Saviour was hanged on a tree, the
land about that city hath been cursed with a barrennes of wood.
And now for a preparative, that their courage might work the
better, they began with a fast,<note place="margin">Iuly 12.</note> and a solemn procession about
mount Olivet.</p>
                  <p>Next day they gave a fierce assault;<note place="margin">Iuly 13.</note> yea,<note n="†" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 8. cap. 13.</note> women played the
men, and fought most valiantly in armour. But they within be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fourty thousand strong, well victualled and appointed, made
stout resistance till the night (accounted but a foe for her friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship)
umpired betwixt them, and abruptly put an end to their
fight in the midst of their courage.</p>
                  <p>When the first light brought news of a morning, they on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh;
the rather, because they had<note n="†" place="margin">P. Aemilius, pag. 136.</note> intercepted a letter tied to the
legs of a dove (it being the fashion of that countrey both to write
and send their letters with the wings of a<note n="†" place="margin">The manner set down at large, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulphs Trav. pag. 43.</note> fowl) wherein the
Persian Emperour promised present succours to the besieged.
The Turks cased the outside of their walls with bags of chaff,
straw, and such like pliable matter, which conquered the engines
of the Christians by yielding unto them. As for one sturdy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
whose force would not be tamed, they brought<note n="†" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 8. cap. 15.</note> two old
witches on the walls to inchant it: but the spirit thereof was too
strong for their spells, so that both of them were miserably slain
in the place.</p>
                  <p>The day following,<note place="margin">Iuly 15.</note> Duke<note n="†" place="margin">Idem lib. 8. cap. 18.</note> Godfrey fired much combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
matter, the smoke whereof (the light cause of an heavie ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect)
driven with the wind, blinded the Turks eyes; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the protection thereof, the Christians entred the citie:
Godfrey himself first footing the walls, and then his brother
Eustace. The Turks retired to Solomons temple (so called
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94789:30"/>
because built in the same place) there to take the farewell of
their lives. In a desperate conflict there, the foremost of the
Christians were miserably slain, thrust upon the weapons of their
enemies by their fellows that followed them. The pavement so
swam, that none could go but either through a rivulet of bloud,
or over a bridge of dead bodies. Valour was not wanting in the
Turks, but superlatively abundant in the Christians, till night
made them leave off. Next morning mercy was proclaimed to
all those that would lay down their weapons: For though bloud
be the best sauce for victory, yet must it not be more then the
meat. Thus was Jerusalem wonne by the Christians, and<note n="*" place="margin">M. Paris, pag. 65.</note> twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thousand Turks therein slain, on the fifteenth of July being
Friday, about three of the clock in the afternoon.<note n="*" place="margin">lib. 8. c. 18.</note> Tyrius find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a great mystery in the time; because Adam was created on
a Friday, and on the same day and hour our Saviour suffered. But
these Synchronismes, as when they are naturall they are pretty
and pleasing; so when violently wrested, nothing more poor
and ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>Then many Christians,<note place="margin">Iuly 18.</note> who all this while had lived in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
in most lamentable slavery, being glad to lurk in secret (as
truth oftentimes seeketh corners, as fearing her judge, though
never as suspecting her cause) came forth joyfully, wellcomed
and embraced these the procurers of their liberty.</p>
                  <p>Three dayes after it was concluded, as necessary piece of
<note n="*" place="margin">Besoldus, De regibus Hierosol. ex variis autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, pag. 119.</note> severity for their defence, to put all the Turks in Jerusalem to
death; which was accordingly performed without favour to age
or sex. The pretence was for fear of treason in them, if the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
of Persia should besiege the city. And some slew them
with the same zeal wherewith Saul slew the Gibeonites; and
thought it unfit that these goats should live in the sheeps pasture.
But noble Tancred was highly displeased hereat, because done
in cold bloud, it being no slip of an extemporary passion, but a
studied and premeditated act; and that against pardon proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
many of them having compounded and paid for their
lives and liberty. Besides, the execution was mercilesse, upon
sucking children, whose not-speaking spake for them; and on
women, whose weaknesse is a shield to defend them against a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
man. To conclude, Severity hot in the fourth degree, is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
better then poyson, and becometh cruelty it self: and this act
seemeth to be of the same nature.</p>

much misery, and felt more, having his eyes put out by King
Henry his brother; and at last found rest (when buried) in the

                  <p>They go on to a second choice; and that they may know the

on oath to confesse their masters faults. The<note n="*" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 9. cap, 2.</note> servants of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey
of Bouillon protested their masters onely fault was this,
That when Mattens were done he would stay so long in the
church, to know of the Priest the meaning of every image and
picture, that dinner at home was spoiled by his long tarrying.
All admired hereat, that this mans worst vice should be so great
a virtue, and unanimously chose him their King. He accepted
the place, but refused the solemnity thereof; and would not
wear a crown of gold there, where the Saviour of mankind had
worn a crown of thorns.</p>
                  <p>He was sonne to Eustace Duke of Bouillon, and Ida his
wife, daughter and heir to Godfrey Duke of Lorrein; born,
saith<note n="†" place="margin">Lib. 9. cap. 5.</note> Tyrius, at Bologne a town in Champaigne on the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
sea, which he mistaketh for Bouillon up higher in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
near the countrey of Lutzenburg. Such slips are incident
to the penns of the best authours: yea, we may see Canterbury
mistaken for Cambridge, not onely in<note n="†" place="margin">Lib. 2. Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mog. p. 50.</note> Munster, but even in all
our own printed Statute-books in the 12. of Richard the<note n="†" place="margin">As Caius proveth it plainly out of Walfingham.</note> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.
He was brought up in that school of valour, the court of
Henry the 4. the Emperour. Whilest he lived there, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
an intricate suit betwixt him and another Prince about
title of land; and because Judges could not untie the knot, it
was concluded the two Princes should cut it asunder with their
sword in a combat. Godfrey was very<note n="†" place="margin">Quantum potuit renite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur, <hi>

that he was the worse souldier, but the better Christian: he
made the demurre not in his courage, but in his conscience; as
conceiving any private title for land not ground enough for a
duell: Yea, we may observe generally, that they who long most
to fight duels, are the first that surfet of them. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he yielded to the tyranny of custome, and after the fashion
of the countrey entred the lists: when at the first encounter his
sword brake, but he struck his adversary down with the hilt,
yet so that he saved his life, and gained his own inheritance.
Another parallel act of his valour was when, being standard-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to the Emperour, he with the imperiall ensign killed Rodul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus
the Duke of Saxony in single fight, and fed the Eagle on
the bowels of that arch-rebell. His soul was enriched with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
virtues, but the most orient of all was his humility, which took
all mens affections without resistance: And though one saith,
Take away ambition, and you take away the spurs of a souldier;
yet, Godfrey without those spurs rode on most triumphantly.</p>

wise and politick, an excellent book-man in reading of men,
and otherwise well studied, especially as that age went, wherein
a mediocrity was an eminency in learning. But he was infected
with the humour of the clergy of that age, who counted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to want room, except they justled with Princes. As for
Arnulphus, he never ceased to trouble and molest this Dabert;
and as a firebrand smoketh most when out of the chimney, so he
after his displacing was most turbulent and unquiet, ever sitting
on his skirts that sate in the Patriarchs chair, till after many chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
he struggled himself again into the place.</p>
                  <p>Under these Patriarchs many Archbishops and Bishops were
appointed, in the very places (as near as might be) where they
were before the Saracens overrunning the countrey, and good
maintenance assigned to most of them.</p>
                  <p>But at this time Bishops were set too thick for all to grow
great; and Palestine fed too many Cathedrall Churches to have
them generally fat.<note n="†" place="margin">Vide tabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Adrico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mii.</note> Lydda, Jamnia, and Joppa, three Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall

9, 12 under the Archbishop of Rabbah, besides 25 suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragan
churches, which it seems were immediately depending
on the Patriarch of Jerusalem, without subordination to any
Archbishop. Surely, many of these Bishops (to use Bishop
<note n="†" place="margin">In the Archbishops of Cant. p. 143.</note> Langhams expression) had high racks, but poor mangers.
Neither let it stagger the reader, if in that catalogue of Tyrius
he light on many Bishops seats which are not to be found in
Mercator, Ortelius, or any other Geographer; for some of them
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94789:33"/>
were such poor places, that they were ashamed to appear in a
map, and fall so much under a Geographers notice, that they
fall not under it. For in that age Bishops had their Sees at poor
and contemptible villages; (as here in England before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,

Fie, said Peter to him, go home again to your wife:
<hi>Whom God hath joyned together, let no man put asunder.</hi> Why
then, replied S. Magnus, have you left your church a widow in
Italy, and live here so farre from her company? This vision,
though calculated for this one Bishop, did generally serve for
all the non-residents which posted hither, and who payed not

was there some difference betwixt their habit in peace and in

                  <p>But it is given to most religious orders, to be clear in the
spring, and mirie in the stream. These Hospitallers afterwards
getting wealth, unlaced themselves from the strictnesse of their

                     <p>The scuffling betwixt the King and Patriarch
about the city of Ierusalem; the issue thereof.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>NOt long after, there was started a controversiè of great
consequence betwixt the King and Patriarch: the Patriarch
claiming the cities of Jerusalem and Joppa, with the appertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances;
the King refusing to surrender them.</p>
                  <p>The Patriarch pleaded, That these places anciently belonged
to his predecessours: He set before the King the hainousnesse of
sacriledge; how great a sin it was when Princes, who should be
nursing-fathers and suckle the Church, shall suck from it: and
shewed how the Common-wealth may grow fat, but never
healthfull, by feeding on the Churches goods.</p>
                  <p>On the other side the King alledged, That the Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
had now purchased Jerusalem with their bloud, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
it on him: that the Patriarchs overgrown title was
drowned in this last conquest; from which, as from a new
foundation, all must build their claims who challenge any right
to any part in that city. Secondly, he pleaded, it was unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
that the King of Jerusalem should have nothing in Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
(as at this day the Romane Emperour is a very ciphre, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
power or profit in Rome) and should live rather as a sojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then a Prince in his royall city, confined to an airy title, whilest
the Patriarch should have all the command.</p>
                  <p>To this the Patriarch answered, That the Christians new
conquest could not cancell his ancient right, which was enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
even under the Saracens; That this voyage was principally
undertaken for advancing the Church, and not to restore her
onely to her liberty, and withhold from her her lands, so that
in this respect she should find better usage from her foes then
from her children. If we mistake not, the chief pinch of the
cause lieth on the Patriarchs proof, that the lands he demanded
formerly belonged to his predecessours: and we find him to fail
in the main issue of the matter. True it was, that for the last
thirty years the Patriarchs, on condition they should repair and
fortifie the walls of Jerusalem, were possessed of a fourth part
of the city, even by grant from Bomensor the Emperour of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94789:35"/>
Saracens, in the yeare of our Lord 1063. But that ever he had
the whole city, either by this or by any previous grant, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
not in Tyrius; who saith moreover,<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 9. cap. 6</note> We wonder for
what reason the lord Patriarch should raise this controversie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Duke Godfrey.</p>
                  <p>Let me adde, that this our Authour is above exception: for
being both a politick states-man and pious prelate, no doubt his
penne striketh the true and even stroke betwixt King and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch.
Besides, he might well see the truth of this matter, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in a well-proportioned distance of time from it. Those who
live too near the stories they write, oftentimes willingly mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
through partiality; and those who live too farre off, are
mistaken by uncertainties, the footsteps of truth being almost
worn out with time.</p>
                  <p>But to return to Godfrey, who though unwilling at first, yet
afterwards not onely on Candlemasse-day restored to the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch
the fourth part of the city, but also on the Easter follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
gave him all Jerusalem, Joppa, and whatsoever he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
conditionally that the King should hold it of the Patriarch
till such time as he could conquer Babylon, or some other roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
city fit for him to keep his Court in. If in the mean time
Godfrey died without issue, the Patriarch was to have it present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delivered unto him.</p>
                  <p>We will be more charitable then those, that say that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
herein did<note n="*" place="margin">Centuriato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, centur. 12. col. 490. De schism.</note> bewitch and bemad Godfrey to make this
large donation to him, by torturing his conscience at the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his sinnes. Onely we may question the discretion of this
Prince in giving a gift of so large a size: for Charities eyes must
be open as well as her hands; though she giveth away her bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
not to part with the root.</p>
                  <p>And let the reader observe, that Godfrey at the time of this
his bountifull grant lay on his death-bed, sick of that irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
disease which ended him. How easily may importunity
stamp any impression on those whom desperate sicknesse hath
softned! And if the sturdiest man nigh death may be affrighted

Godfrey were pliable to any demand.<note n="*" place="margin">In his Pass. 11.</note> Pierce Plowman maketh

                  <p>He was properly the first King of Jerusalem (his brother<note place="margin">Dec. 25.</note>
Godfrey never accounted more then a Duke) and was crowned
on Christmas-day. The reason that made him assume the

the Pagans. Thus our Kings of England from the dayes of

made, to wear a crown of gold where Christ wore one of
thorns, Baldwine easily dispensed therewith. And surely in
these things the mind is all: A crown might be refused with
pride, and worn with humility.</p>
                  <p>But before his Coronation there was a tough bickering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the city of Jerusalem. Dabert the Patriarch, on the death
of Godfrey, devoured Jerusalem and the tower of David in his
hope, but coming to take possession, found the place too hot for
him. For Garnier Earl of Gretz, in the behalf of King Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine
(who was not yet returned from Edessa) manned it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him. But so it happened, that this valiant Earl died
three dayes after, which by<note n="†" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 10. cap. 4.</note> Dabert was counted a just
judgement of God upon him for his sacriledge. Now
though it be piety to impute all events to Gods hand, yet to
say that this mans death was for such a sinne, sheweth too much
presumption towards God, and too little charity towards
our neighbour. Indeed if sudden death had singled out this
Earl alone, it had somewhat favoured their censure; but there
was then a generall mortality in the city which swept away

interpreted sacriledge, others accounted loyalty to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.
As for that donation of the city of Jerusalem and

was unreasonable that a Prince should in such sort fetter and

Baldwine having both the stronger sword, and possession of the

                  </argument>
                  <p>AFterwards,<note place="margin">1102</note> this breach betwixt the King and Patriarch
was made up by the mediation of some friends: but the
skinne onely was drawn over, not dead flesh drawn out of the
wound; and Arnulphus (whom we mentioned before) discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
for his losse of the Patriarchs place, still kept the sore raw
betwixt them. At last Dabertus the Patriarch was fain to flee to
Antioch, where he had plentifull maintenance allowed him by
Bernard Patriarch of that See.<note place="margin">1103</note> But he was too high in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>step
to wear another mans shoes, and conceived himself to be
but in a charitable prison whilest he lived on anothers benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
Wherefore hence he hasted to<note n="†" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 11. cap. 4.</note> Rome, complained to
the Pope, and received from his Holinesse a command to
King Baldwine to be reestablished in the Patriarchs place, but
returning home died by the way at Messana in Sicily, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
seven years Patriarch, four at home, and three in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>
                  <p>Whilest Dabert was thrust out,<note place="margin">1107</note> one Ebremarus was made
Patriarch against his will by King Baldwine. An holy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
man; but he had more of the dove then the serpent, and
was none of the deepest reach. He hearing that he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of to the Pope for his irregular election, posted to
Rome to excuse himself, shewing he was chosen against his
will: and though preferment may not be snatched, it needs not
be thrust away. But all would not do; It was enough to put him
out, because the King put him in. Wherefore he was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to return home, and to wait the definitive sentence, which
Gibellinus Archbishop of Arles and the Popes Legate should
pronounce in the matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:94789:37"/>Gibellinus coming to Jerusalem, concluded the election of
Ebremarus to be illegall and void, and was himself chosen
Patriarch in his place; and the other in reverence of his piety
made Archbishop of Cesarea.<note place="margin">1108</note> And though Arnulphus (the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand
of this Church) desired the Patriarchs place for himself,
yet was he better content with Gibellinus his election, because
he was a through-old man, and hoped that candle would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
go out that was in the socket.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 11. cap. 28.</note> To this Gibellinus King Baldwine granted, that all places
which he or his successours should winne, should be subject to
his jurisdiction; and this also was confirmed by Pope Paschall
the 2.<note place="margin">Baronius in anne 1108.</note> But Bernard Patriarch of Antioch found himself much
aggrieved hereat; because many of these cities by the ancient ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
of the Council of Nice, were subject to his Church. At last
the Pope took the matter into his hand, and stroked the angry
Patriarch of Antioch into gentlenesse with good language.
He shewed, how since the Council of Nice the countrey had
got a new face; ancient mountains were buried, rivers drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in oblivion, and they new christened with other names: Yea,
the deluge of the Saracens tyranny had washed away the
bounds of the Churches jurisdictions, that now they knew not
their own severals, where Mahometanisme so long had made
all common and waste. He desired him therefore to be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with this new division of their jurisdictions: especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was reasonable, that the King of Jerusalem and his
successours should dispose of those places, which they should
winne with their own swords. Bernard perceiving hereby how
his Holinesse stood affected in the businesse, contented his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
that he had set his title on foot, and then quietly let it
fall to the ground, as counting it no policy to shew his teeth
where he durst not bite.</p>
                  <p>Gibellinus never laid claim to the city of Jerusalem, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was in thankfulnesse for this large ecclesiasticall
power which King Baldwine had bestowed upon him, or that
his old age was too weak to strive with so strong an adversary.
He sate four years in his chair, and Arnulphus thinking he went
too slow to the grave, is suspected to have given him something
to have mended his pace, and was himself substituted in his
room by the especiall favour of K. Baldwine.</p>
                  <p>This Arnulphus was called <hi>mala corona,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1112</note> as if all vices met in
him to dance a round. And no wonder if the King being himself
wantonly disposed, advanced such a man: for generally, loose
Patrons cannot abide to be pinched and pent with over-strict
Chaplains. Besides, it was policy in him to choose such a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
as was liable to exceptions for his vitious life; that so if
he began to bark against the King, his mouth might be quickly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94789:37"/>
stopped. Arnulphus was as quiet as a lamb, and durst never
challenge his interest in Jerusalem from Godfreys donation; as
fearing to wrastle with the King, who had him on the hip, and
could out him at pleasure for his bad manners. Amongst other
vices he was a great church-robber, who to make Emmelor his
niece a Princesse, and to marry Eustace Prince of Sidon, gave
her the city of Jericho for her dowrie, and lands belonging to
his See worth five thousand crowns yearly. And though Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
may pretend that marriage causeth covetousnesse in the
Clergy, yet we shall find when the Prelacy were constrained to
a single life, that their nephews are more church-bread then
now the children of married Ministers. Yea, some Popes not
onely fed their bastards with church-milk, but even cut off the
churches breasts for their pompous and magnificent mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
And thus having dispatched the story of the Church in
this Kings reigne, we come now to handle the businesse of the
Common-wealth entirely by it self.</p>

                  <p>But the main matter which made this whole voyage miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

whose hands it was to passe. For Alexius the Grecian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
feared, lest betwixt the Latines in the East in Palestine, and
West in Europe, as betwixt two milstones, his Empire lying
in the midst should be ground to powder. Whereupon, as these
Pilgrims went through his countrey, he did them all possible
mischief, still under pretence of kindnesse, (What hinderer
to a false helper?) calling the chief Captains of the army his

in Palestine: for hitherto Joppa was the onely port
the Christians had; but now by the assistance of the Genoan
fleet (who for their pains were to have<note n="†" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 10. cap. 14.</note> a third part of the
spoil, and a whole street to themselves of every city they took)
Baldwine wonne most considerable havens along the mid-land-sea.
He began with Antipatris, to ransome the Christian ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

were slain. This was the first great overthrow the Christians
suffered in Palestine: and needs must blows be grievous to them
who were not used to be beaten. The King was reported slain,
but fame deserved to be pardoned for so good a lie; which for

his numerous enemies with an handfull of men; and so
brake himself, with covetousnesse to purchase more honour
then he could pay for. And herein he discovered his want of
judgement, being indeed like an arrow well-feathered, but with
a blunt pile; he flew swift, but did not sink deep. Thus his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
lay bleeding, but he quickly stanched it. The Pagans little
suspecting to be re-incountred, gave themselves over to mirth
and jollity (as security oftentimes maketh the sword to fall out
of their hands from whom no force could wrest it) when
Baldwine coming on them with fresh souldiers, strook them
with the backblows of an unexpected enemy, which alwayes
pierce the deepest, routed them and put them to the flight. This
his victory followed so suddenly after his overthrow, that some
mention not the overthrow at all, but the victory onely; as that
good horseman is scarce perceived to be thrown, that quickly

which here were made. The glassie sand was fetched

This city anciently was of great renown: but her fortune being
as brittle as her glasses, she was fain to find neck for every one
of the Monarchs yokes; and now at last (by the assistance of the
<note n="*" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 11. cap. 14.</note> Danish and Norvegian fleet) was subdued by the Christians.</p>
                  <p>Fleshed with this conquest,<note place="margin">Dec. 19. 1112</note> they next besieged Tyre. Sea and
land, nature and art consented together to make this city strong:
for it was seated in an island, save that it was tacked to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
with a small neck of land, which was fortified with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
walls and towers. It is questionable whether the strength
or wealth of this city was greater; but out of question that the
pride was greater then either. Here the best purples were died,
a colour even from the beginning destined to Courts and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy;
and here the richest clothes were embroidered and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
wrought. And though generally those who are best
with their fingers are worst with their arms, yet the Tyrians
were also stout men, able mariners, and the planters of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
colonies in the world. As their city was the daughter of
Sidon, so was it mother to Romes rivall Carthage, Leptis, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,
Cadiz, and Nola. The most plentifull proof they gave of
their valour was, when for three years they defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against Nebuchadnezzar; and afterwards stopped the full
career of Alexanders conquests; so that his victorious army
which did flie into other countreys, was glad to creep into this
city. Yet after seven moneths siege (such is the omnipotency
of industry) he forced it, and stripped this lady of the sea naked
beyond modesty and mercy, putting all therein to the sword
that resisted, and hanged up 2000 of the prime citizens in a rank

                  <p>AFter the tempest of a long warre a calm came at last, and
King Baldwine had a five years vacation of peace in his
old age: In which time he disported himself with many voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
for pleasure:<note place="margin">1116</note> as, one to the Red-sea, not so called from
the rednesse of the water, or sand, as some without any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour

surveyed the countrey,<note place="margin">1117</note> with the nature and strength thereof.
Another journey he took afterwards into<note n="†" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 11. cap. 31.</note> Egypt, as concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

                     </gap> into that
countrey, in part of paiment of those many excursions the Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians
had made into his Kingdome. He took the city of<note n="†" place="margin">Calvisius makes it to be wonne at the former voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramia,
anciently called Rameses, and gave the spoil thereof to
his souldiers. This work being done, he began his play, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
the time with viewing that riddle of Nature, the river
of Nilus, whose stream is the confluence of so many wonders:
first, for its indiscoverable fountain; though some late Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
because they would be held more intelligent then others,
have found the head of Nilus in their own brains, and make it
to flow from a fountain they fansie in the mountains of the
moon, in the south of Africa: then, for the strange creatures
bred therein; as river-bulls, horses, and crocodiles: But the
chiefest wonder is the yearly increasing thereof from the<note n="†" place="margin">Sand. Trav. pag. 94.</note> 17.
of June to the midst of September, overflowing all Egypt,
and the banks of all humane judgement to give the true reason
thereof.</p>
                  <p>Much time Baldwine spent in beholding this river, wherein
he took many fishes, and his death in eating them: for a new
surfet revived the grief of an old wound, which he many years
before received at the siege of Ptolemais. His sicknesse put him
in mind of his sinnes, conscience speaking loudest when men
begin to grow speechlesse: And especially he grieved, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
another wife alive, he had married the Countesse of Sicilie,
the relict of Earl Roger: But now heartily sorrowfull for his
fault, he sent away this his last wife; yet we reade not that he
received his former again. Other faults he would have amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but was prevented by death. And no doubt where the deed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94789:41"/>
could not be present, the desire was a sufficient proxy. He died
at Laris, a city in the road from Egypt, and was brought to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
and buried on Palm-sunday in the temple of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre,<note place="margin">1118 Mar. 26.</note>
in the 18 year of his reign.</p>
                  <p>A Prince superiour to his brother Godfrey in learning, equall
in valour, inferiour in judgement; rash, precipitate, greedy of
honour, but swallowing more then he could digest, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
what he was not able to perform; little affected to the
Clergy, or rather to their temporall greatnesse, especially when
it came in competition with his own; much given to women,
(besides the three wives he had, first marrying Gutrera an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish-woman;
after her death, Tafror an Armenian Lady; and
whilest she yet survived, the Countesse of Sicilie) yet he had
no child, God commonly punishing wantonnesse with barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
For the rest, we referre the reader to the dull Epitaph
written on his tomb, which (like the verses of that age) runneth
in a kind of rythme, though it can scarce stand on true feet:

peaceably renounceth his right.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT happened the same day King Baldwine was buried, that
Baldwine de Burgo his kinsman and Count of Edessa came
casually into the city, intending onely there to keep his Easter:
when behold the Christian Princes met together for the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94789:41"/>
of a new King. The greater part did centre their suffrages
on Prince Eustace, brother to the two former Kings, but then
absent in France. They alledged, That it was not safe to break
the chain of succession, where the inversion of order bringeth all
to confusion; and, That it was high ingratitude to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Godfrey and Baldwine, to exclude their brother from
the crown; especially he being fit in all points to be a King,
wanting nothing but that he wanted to be there; That in the
mean time some might be deputed to lock up all things safe, and
to keep the keyes of the State till he should arrive.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, some objected the dangers of an <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regnum,</hi>
how when a State is headlesse, every malecontent
would make head; inconveniences in another countrey would be
mischiefs here, where they lived in the mouth of their enemies:
and therefore to stay for a King, was the way to lose the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>Then Joceline Prince of Tiberias, a man of great authority,
offered himself a moderatour in this difference, and councelled
both sides to this effect: To proceed to a present election, and
therein to be directed, not confined by succession; though they
missed the next, let them take one of Godfreys kindred: As the
case now stood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he must be counted next in bloud that was next
at hand; and this was Baldwine Count of Edessa, on whom he
bestowed much superlative praises. All were much affected with
these his commendations; for they knew that Joceline was his
sworn adversary, and concluded that it must needs be a mighty
weight of worth in Baldwine, which pressed out praise from the
mouth of his enemy: though indeed private ends prompted
him to speak this speech, who hoped himself to get the Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Edessa when Baldwine should be translated to Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.
However, his words took effect, and Baldwine hereupon
was chosen King,<note n="*" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 12. cap. 4.</note> and crowned on Easter-day by Arnulphus
the Patriarch.<note place="margin">1118 April 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mean time some secretly were sent to Prince Eustace to come
and challenge the crown. But he hearing that another was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in possession, though he was on his journey coming, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
went back again. A large alms, to give away a Kingdome
out of his charity to the publick cause.</p>
                  <p>Baldwine was of a proper personage, and able body, both
nigh Rhemes in France, sonne to Hugh Count of Rorstet and
Millisent his wife. He was exceedingly charitable to the poore,
and pious towards God; witnesse the brawn on his hands and
knees made with continuall praying: valiant also, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
well seen in all martiall affairs.</p>
                  <p>We had almost forgotten what happened in this yeare, the

We left Arnulphus the last Patriarch of Jerusalem;
since which time the bad favour of his life came to the Popes
nose, who sent a Legate to depose him. But Arnulphus hasted
to Rome with much<note n="†" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 11. cap. 26.</note> money, and there bought himself to be
innocent, so that he enjoyed the place during his life.</p>
                  <p>Guarimund succeeded in his place, a very religious man,<note place="margin">1119</note> by
whom God gave the Christians many victories. He called a
Council at Neapolis or Sichem, wherein many wholesome
things were concluded for reformation of manners. Betwixt
him and William Archbishop of Tyre (an English man) there
arose a difference, because this Archbishop would not receive
his confirmation of him, (from whom by ancient right he should
take it) but from the Pope, counting it the most honour to hold
of the highest landlord: And indeed the Pope for gain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
him, though he should have sent him to the Patriarch.
But the court of Rome careth not though men steal their corn,
so be it they bring it to their mills to grind.</p>
                  <p>After Guarimunds death,<note place="margin">1128</note> Stephen Abbot of S. John de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia
was chosen Patriarch; once a cavallier, but afterward laying
down the sword, he took up the Word, and entred into Orders.
He awaked the Patriarchs title to Jerusalem, which had slept
during his three predecessours, and challenged it very imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
of the King; for he was a man of spirit and metall. And
indeed he had too much life to live long. For the King fearing
what flame this spark might kindle, and finding him to be an
active man, gave him (as it is suspected) a little more active poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94789:42"/>
which cut him off in the midst of his age, and beginning of
his projects.</p>
                  <p>The King coming to him when he lay on his death-bed, asked
him how he did: To whom he answered, My<note n="†" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 13. cap. 25.</note> Lord, for the
present I am as you would have me. A cruel murder, if true:
But it is strange,<note place="margin">1130</note> that he whose hands (as we have said) were
hardened with frequent prayer, should soften them again in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
bloud. Wherefore we will not condemn the memory
of a King on doubtfull evidence. The Patriarchs place was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

beloved then learned.</p>

                  <p>IT is worth the Readers marking, how this Kings reign was
checquered with variety of fortune: For first, Roger Prince
of Antioch (or rather guardian in the minority of young Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund)
went forth with greater courage then discretion;<note place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 12. cap. 10.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
his successe was answerable, being conquered and killed by
the Turks. But Baldwine on the 14 of August following, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the Turks to a restitution of their victory, and with a small
army gave them a great overthrow, in spite of Gazi their boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Generall.</p>
                  <p>To qualifie the Christians joy for this good successe,<note place="margin">1122</note> Joce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
unadvisedly fighting with Balak, a petty King of the Turks,
was conquered and taken prisoner: and King Baldwine coming
to deliver him, was also taken himself; for which he might thank
his own rashnesse: For it had been his best work to have done
nothing for a while, till the Venetian succours which were not
farre off, had come to him; and not presently to adventure all to
the hazard of a battel.</p>
                  <p>Yet the Christians hands were not bound in the Kings capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94789:43"/>
For Eustace Grenier, chosen Vice-roy whilest the King
was in durance, stoutly defended the countrey: and Count
Joceline, which had escaped out of prison, fighting again with
Balak at Hircapolis, routed his army, and killed him with his
own hands. But the main piece of service was the taking of
Tyre, which was done under the conduct of Guarimund the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
of Jerusalem; but chiefly by the help of the Venetian
navie, which Michael their Duke brought, who for their pains
were to have a third part of the city to themselves. Tyre had
in it store of men and munition; but famine increasing (against
whose arrows there is no armour of proof) it was yielded on
honourable terms. And though perhaps hunger shortly would
have made the Turks digest courser conditions, yet the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
were loth to anger their enemies valour into desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p>Next year the King returned home,<note place="margin">Iune 29.</note> having been eighteen

                  <p>To correct the ranknesse of the Christians pride for this good

Heaven discharged against them thunder-ordinance, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows

wasted were forced to depart. And this affliction was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
when Boemund the young Prince of Antioch, one of
great hope and much lamented, was defeated and slain. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
impute these mishaps to the Christians pride,<note place="margin">1131</note> and relying
on their own strength, which never is more untrusty then when
most trusted. True it was, God often gave them great victories,
when they defended themselves in great straits: Hereupon they
turned their thankfulnesse into presumption, grew at last from
defending themselves to dare their enemies on disadvantages to

                     <p>The death of Baldwine the second.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>KIng Baldwine a little before his death renounced the
world, and took on him a religious habit. This was the
fashion of many Princes in that age, though they did it for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
ends. Some thought to make amends for their disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
lives by entring into some holy order at their deaths: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
having surfeited of the worlds vanity, fasted from it when
they could eat no more because of the impotency of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
Others being crossed by the world by some misfortune,
sought to crosse the world again in renouncing of it. These like
furious gamesters threw up their cards, not out of dislike of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
but of their game; and they were rather discontented to
live then contented to dye. But we must believe that Baldwine
did it out of true devotion, to ripen himself for heaven, because
he was piously affected from his youth; so that all his life was
religiously tuned, though it made the sweetest musick in the
close. He died not long after, on the 22 of August, in the 13
year of his reign; and was buried with his predecessours in
the temple of the Sepulchre. By Morphe a Grecian Lady his
wife, he had four daughters: whereof Millesent was the eldest;
the second Alice, married to young Boemund Prince of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och;
the third Hodiern, wife to Reimund Prince of Tripoli;
and Mete the youngest, Abbesse of Bethanie.</p>

                     <p>Of Fulco, the fourth King of Ierusalem.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>FUlco Earl of Tours, Main, and Anjou, coming some three
years before on pilgrimage to Jerusalem,<note place="margin">1132</note> there took in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
Millesent the Kings daughter. He had assigned to him the
city of Tyre, and some other princely accommodations for
his present maintenance, and the Kingdome after the death of
his father in law, which he received accordingly. He was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh
60 years old: And by his first wife he had a sonne,
Geffrey Plantagenet Earl of Anjou; to whom he left his lands in
France, and from whom our Kings of England are descended.
This Fulco was a very valiant man, able both of body and
mind. His greatest defect was a weak memory, (though not so
bad as that of<note n="†" place="margin">Tlin. lib. 7. cap. 24.</note> Messala Corvinus, who forgot his own name)
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94789:44"/>
insomuch that he knew not his own servants; and those whom
he even now preferred, were presently after strangers unto him.
Yet though he had a bad memory whilest he lived, he hath
a good one now he is dead, and his virtues are famous to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.</p>

                     <p>The Church-story during this Kings reigne; The
remarkable ruine of Rodolphus Patriarch of
Antioch.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe Church of Jerusalem yielded no alterations in the
reign of Fulco. But in Antioch there was much stirre
who should succeed Bernard that peaceable long-lived man,
who fate 36 years, and survived eight Patriarchs of Jerusalem.
Now whilest the Clergie were tedious in their choice, the
Laity was too nimble for them, and they (thinking it equall to
have an hand in making, who must have their arms in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Patriarch) clapped one<note n="†" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 15.</note> Rodolphus of noble parentage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the chair.<note place="margin">1136</note> He presently took his pall off from the altar of S.
Peter, thereby sparing both his purse and pains to go to Rome,
and acknowledging no other superiour then that Apostle for
his patrone. This man was the darling of the Gentry, (and no
wonder if they loved him who was of their cloth and making)
but hated of the Clergy. Wherefore knowing himself to need
strong arms who was to swim against the stream, he wrought
himself into the favour of the Princesse of Antioch, the widow
of young Boemund, so that he commanded all her command,
and beat down his enemies with her strength. He promised to
make a marriage betwixt her and Reimund Earl of Poictou, (a
Frenchman of great fame, who was coming into these parts)
but he deceived her, and caused the Earl to marry Constantia
the daughter of this Lady, by whom he had the principality of
Antioch. Indeed this Constantia was but a child for age; but
they never want years to marry, who have a Kingdome for
their portion.</p>
                  <p>The Patriarch to make sure work, bound Prince Reimund
by an oath to be true to him: But friends unjustly gotten, are
seldome comfortably enjoyed: Of his sworn friend, he proved
his sworn enemy, and forced him to go up to Rome, there to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
many accusations laid to his charge; wherein the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
perchance was true, though malice might set the varnish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:94789:45"/>
on it. The main matter was, that he made odious comparisons
betwixt Antioch and Rome, and counted himself equal to his
Holinesse.</p>
                  <p>Rodolphus coming to Rome found the Popes dores shut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, but he opened them with a golden key. Money he
sowed plentifully, and reaped it when he came to be tried; for
he found their hands very soft towards him whom formerly he
had greased in the fist. He also resigned his old pall, and took
a new one from the Pope. As for his other crimes, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
that Albericus Bishop of Ostia should be sent into Syria

cited the Patriarch to appear; who b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his contempt; others to his fear of his enemies potency, or

judgement, but ravished with prejudice; being prepossessed
with this intent to dispossesse him of his place. Some thought he
relied on his peace formerly made at Rome, where the illegality
of his election was rectified by his laying down his first pall, and
assuming a new one from the Pope.</p>
                  <p>Here was it worth the beholding in what severall<note n="*" place="margin">Baronius, in anno 1136.</note> streams
mens affections ran. All wished that the tree might be felled,
who had hopes to gather chips by his fall; and especially one
Arnulphus, and Dean Lambert, the promoters against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch.
Others pitied him, and though perchance content that
his roof might be taken down, were loth he should be razed to
the ground. Some reserved their affections till they were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled
by the event which side to favour; and would not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
by any manifest declaration, but so that they might fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
retreat if need required. Amongst other Prelates which were
present, Serlo Archbishop of Apamea was one, who formerly
had been a great enemy to the Patriarch, but had lately taken
himself off from that course. The Legate demanded of him
why he proceeded not to accuse the Patriarch as he was wont:
To whom he answered,<note n="*" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 15. cap. 16.</note> 
                     <q>What formerly I did, was done out

the nakednesse of my father, like to cursed Cham; and now
God hath recalled me from mine errour: so that I will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
accuse, nor presumptuously judge him, but am ready to
die for his safety.</q> Hereupon the Legate immediately (such
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94789:45"/>
was the martiall law in a Church-man) deposed him from his
Archbishoprick. Little hope then had the Patriarch, who saw
himself condemned in his friend:<note place="margin">Idem, lib. 15<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<note n="†" place="margin">Vide suprà, book 1. c. 15.</note> Alexius his father.</p>
                  <p>Hereat Reimund and all the Latines stormed out of measure:
Had they purchased the inheritance of the land with their own
bloud, now to turn tenants at will to another? Some pleaded,
That the ill usage of Alexius<note n="†" place="margin">Vrsperg. pag. 233. tortis sacramentis.</note> extorted from Godfrey and the
rest of the Pilgrimes that agreement; and an oath made by force,
is of no force, but may freely be broken, because not freely
made. Others alledged, That when Antiochia was first wonne,
it was offered to Alexius, and<note n="†" place="margin">Vide suprà, book 1. c. 15.</note> he refused it: so fair a tender was
a paiment. Others argued, That that generation which made
this contract was wholly dead; and that the debt descended not
on them to make it good. But most insisted on this, That
Alexius kept not his covenants, and assisted them not according
to the agreement. Indeed he called these Princes his sonnes;
but he disinherited them of their hopes, and all their portion
was in promises never payed. No reason then, that the knot of
the agreement should hold them fast, and let him loose.</p>
                  <p>The worst of these answers had been good enough, if their
swords had been as strong as the Grecian Emperours. But he
coming with a numerous army, in few dayes overcame all Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia
(which for fourty years had belonged to the Prince of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch)
and then besieged the city of Antioch it self. Force is
the body, and resolution the soul of an action: both these were
well tempered together in the Emperours army; and the city
brought to great distresse. Whereupon Fulk King of Jerusalem
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94789:46"/>
with some other Princes, fearing what wofull conclusion
would follow so violent premisses, made a composition between
them. So that Reimund did homage to the Emperour, and
held his principality as a vassall from him.<note place="margin">1146</note> And though four
years after the Emperour came again into these parts, yet he
did not much harm; pillaging was all his conquest. Some years
after he died, being accidentally poisoned by one of his own
arrows which he intended for the wild boar. A Prince so much
better to the Latines then his father Alexius, as an honourable
foe is above a treacherous friend. His Empire he disposed to
Emmanuel his sonne.</p>

                     <p>Of Fulcher Patriarch of Ierusalem, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency
of the Hospitallers against him.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WIlliam, who was last possessed of the Patriarchs chair
in Jerusalem, was none of the greatest clerks. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he was for edifying of the Church, he was excellent at
building of Castles (one at Askelon, another at Ramula, a third
called Blank-guard for the securig of Pilgrimes) till at last ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sate in his place fifteen years,<note place="margin">1145</note> he was translated to heaven,
and on earth Fulcher Archbishop of Tyre succeeded him. An
honest old man, whose weak age was much molested with the
pride and rebellion of the Hospitallers, who lately had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the Pope a plenary exemption from the Patriarch.
This his Holinesse did the more willingly grant, because here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he made himself absolute master of all orders, pinning them
on himself by an immediate dependance, and so bringing water
to his mill by a straighter and nearer stream. But hereby the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirenesse
of Episcopall jurisdiction was much maimed and mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and every Covent was a castle of rebells, armed with privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
to fight against their lawfull Diocesan.</p>
                  <p>Now as these Hospitallers wronged the power of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
so did they rob the profit of poor Priests, refusing to
pay any tithes of their Mannours, which contained many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
(so that the Pastours who fed the flocks, were starved
themselves; and having laboured all day in the vineyard, were
at night sent supperlesse to bed) the Hospitallers pleading that
the Pope had freed them from these duties; as if an acquittance
under the hand of his Holinesse was sufficient to discharge them
from paying of tithes, a debt due to God. Other foul crimes
they also were guilty of: as, outbraving the temple of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre
with their stately buildings; giving the Sacraments to,
and receiving of excommunicate persons; ringing their bells
when their Patriarch preached, that his voice might not be
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94789:48"/>
heard; shooting<note n="†" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 18. cap. 3.</note> arrows into the church to disturb him and the
people in Divine service; A bundle whereof were hung up as a
monument of their impiety.</p>
                  <p>Fulcher the Patriarch crawled to Rome,<note place="margin">1156</note> being 100 years
old, to complain of these misdemeanours; carrying with him
the Archbishop of Tyre, and five other Bishops. But he had
sped better, if in stead of every one of them he had carried a bag
of gold. For the Hospitallers prevented him, and had formerly
been effectually present with their large bribes; so that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
suit was very cold: And no wonder, seeing he did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
no fewel to heat it. The Cardinals eyes in the court of
Rome were old and dimme; and therefore the glasse wherein
they see any thing must be well-silvered. Indeed two of them,
Octavian, and John of S. Martin, favoured Christs cause and his
Ministers; but<note n="†" place="margin">Alii omnes abeuntes post munera, secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti sunt vias Balaam filii Bosor. <hi>Tyrius, lib. 18. cap.</hi> 8.</note> all the rest followed gifts, and the way of Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am

grievances unredressed. Whereupon the Hospitallers grew more

wear no girdle; denying not onely subjection, but any filiall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

                  <p>And here to our grief must we take our finall farewell of the

that they sate; such is the obscurity and confusion of it. Yet no

the year 1160 first instituted the order of Carmelites.
Indeed formerly they lived dispersed about the mountain of
Carmel: but he gathered them together into one house; because
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:94789:48"/>
solitarinesse is a trespasse against the nature of man, and God
when he had made all things good, saw it was not good for man
to be alone.</p>
                  <p>Surely from great antiquity in the Primitive Church,<note place="margin">Polyd. Virg. lib. 7. cap. 3. Sabel. Enn. 9. lib. 5.</note> many
retired themselves to solitary places, (where they were alwayes
alone, and alwayes in the company of good thoughts) chiefly
to shade themselves from the heat of persecution.<note place="margin">Hospin. De orig. mon.</note> Whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
was in after-ages imitated by others, when there was no
such necessity: As here by these Carmelites; whose order was
afterwards perfected in the year 1216, by Albert Patriarch of
Jerusalem, with certain Canonicall observations imposed upon
them. And in the next age, these bees which first bred in the
ground and hollow trees, got them hives in gardens; and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the deserts, gained them princely houses in pleasant pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
They pretended indeed that they followed the pattern of
Elias, though farre enough from his example: First, for their
habit; they wore<note n="†" place="margin">Antoninus, tit. 20. cap. 5.</note> white coats guarded with red streaks: but
they have no colour in the Bible that Elias ever wore such a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;
it suits rather with Joseph then with him. Secondly, by
their order they were to ride on he-asses; whereas we read that
Elias went on foot, and rode but once in a chariot of fire. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they by the constitution of Pope Nicolas the 5. had<note n="†" place="margin">Balaeus in vita Nicol. 5.</note> sisters
of their company living near unto them; we find Elias to have
no such feminine consorts. Fourthly, they lived in all lust and

that they were Sodomites, and compared them to the tail of the
Dragon: so that their luxury differed from Elias his austerity,
as much as velvet from sackcloth. Wherefore that the Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
came from mount Carmel cannot be denyed: But on that
mountain I find that both Elias and Baals priests gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and let the indifferent reader judge which of them their
lives do most resemble.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards Pope Honorius 3. counting the party-coloured
coats these Carmelites did wear to be too gaudy, caused them
to wear onely white, the colour which nature doth die; simple,
and therefore fittest for religion. But Melexala King of Egypt,
who formerly was very bountifull to the Carmelites, knew not
his Alms-men in their new coats, but changed his love, as
they their livery, and persecuted them out of all Egypt. It

their own fear was their greatest enemy; and those swords of

                     </gap>ent Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother
and the Nobility; thus occasioned: There was a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-man
called Manasses, whom the Queen (governing all in
her sonnes minority) made Constable of the Kingdome. This
man unable to manage his own happinesse, grew so insolent that
he could not go, but either spurning his equals, or trampling on
his inferiours. No wonder then, if envy, the shadow of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
waited upon him. The<note n="*" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 17. cap. 13.</note> Nobility highly distasted him:
but in all oppositions the Queens favour was his sanctuary; who
to shew her own absolutenesse, and that her affection should not
be controlled, nor that thrown down which she set up, still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the creature she had made.</p>
                  <p>His enemies perceiving him so fast rooted in her favour, and
seeing they could not remove him from his foundation, sought
to remove him with his foundation; instigating young King
Baldwine against his mother, and especially against her favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.
They complained how the State groaned under his inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency;
He was the bridge by which all offices must passe,
and there pay toll; He alone sifted all matters, and then no
wonder if much bran passed; He under pretence of opening the
Queens eyes did lead her by the nose, captivating her judgement
in stead of directing it; He like a by-gulf devoured her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
which should flow to her children. They perswaded the
King he was ripe for government, and needed none to hold his
hand to hold the sceptre. Let him therefore either un tie or cut
himself loose from this slavery, and not be in subjection to a
subject.</p>
                  <p>Liberty needeth no hard-pressing on youth, a touch on that
stamp maketh an impression on that waxen age. Young Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine
is apprehensive of this motion, and prosecuteth the matter
so eagerly, that at length he coopeth up this Manasses in a
castle, and forceth him to abjure the Kingdome. Much stirre af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
was betwixt him and his mother; till at last to end di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
the Kingdome was divided betwixt them: She had the
city of Jerusalem, and the land-locked part; he the maritime
half of the land. But the widest throne is too narrow for two to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94789:52"/>
sit on together. He not content with this partition, marcheth fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
to Jerusalem, there to besiege his mother, and to take all
from her. Out of the city cometh<note n="†" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 17. cap. 14.</note> Fulcher the good Patriarch,
(his age was a patent for his boldnesse) and freely reproveth the
King: Why should he go on in such an action wherein every step
he stirred, his legs must needs grate and crash both against nature
and religion? Did he thus requite his mothers care in stewarding
the State, thus to affright her age, to take arms against her? Was
it not her goodnesse to be content with a moyety, when the
whole Kingdome in right belonged unto her?</p>
                  <p>But ambition had so inchanted Baldwine, that he was pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable
with no reasons which crossed his designes: so that by the
advice of her friends she was content to resign up all, lest the
Christian cause should suffer in these dissensions. She retired her
self to<note n="†" place="margin">Idem, ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</note> Sebaste, and abridged her train from State to necessity.
And now the lesse room she had to build upon, the higher she
raised her soul with heavenly meditations; and lived as more
private, so more pious till the day of her death.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THese discords betwixt mother and son were harmonie in
the ears of Noradine the Turk: Who coming with a great
army wasted all about Antioch; and Prince Reimund going out
to bid him battel, was slain himself, and his army overthrown:
nor long after Joceline Count of Edessa was intercepted by the
Turks, and taken prisoner.</p>
                  <p>As for Constantia the relict of Reimund Prince of Antioch,
she lived a good while a widow, refusing the affections which
many princely suiters proffered unto her, till at last she descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
beneath her self to marry a plain man,<note place="margin">1153</note> Reinold of Castile.
Yet why should we say so, when as a Castilian Gentleman (if
that be not a needlesse tautologie) as he maketh the inventory of
his own worth, prizeth himself any Princes fellow: And the
proverb is, Each lay-man of Castile may make a King, each
clergy-man a Pope? Yea, we had best take heed how we speak
against this match: for Almericus Patriarch of Antioch for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing
against it, was by this Prince Reinold set in the heat of
the sunne with his<note n="†" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 18. cap. 1.</note> bare head besmeared with honey (a sweet
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94789:53"/>
bitter torment) that so bees might sting him to death. But King
Baldwine mediated for him, and obtained his liberty that he
might come to Jerusalem, where he lived many years in good
esteem. And Gods judgements are said to have overtaken the
Prince of Antioch: for besides the famine which followed in his
countrey, he himself afterwards fighting unfortunately with the
Turks, was taken prisoner.</p>
                  <p>But let us step over to Jerusalem; where we shall find King
Baldwine making preparation for the siege of Askelon: Which
citie after it had been long locked up, had at last an assaultable
breach made in the walls thereof. The Templars (to whom the
King promised the spoil if they took it) entred through this
breach into the citie: and conceiving they had enow to wield the
work and master the place, set a guard at the breach, that no more
of their fellow-Christians should come in to be sharers with
them in the booty. But their<note n="†" place="margin">Tyrius. lib. 17. cap. 27.</note> covetousnesse cost them their
lives: for the Turks contemning their few number put them
every one to the sword. Yet at last the city was taken, though
with much difficulty.<note place="margin">1154 Aug. 12.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Other considerable victories Baldwine got of the Turks; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
one at the river Jordan, where he vanquished Noradine:
And twice he relieved Cesarea-Philippi, which the Turks had
straitly besieged. But death at last put a period to his earthly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
being poisoned (as it was supposed) by a Jewish physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian;
for the rest of the potion killed a dog to whom it was
given. This Kings youth was stained with unnaturall discords
with his mother, and other vices, which in his settled age he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
Let the witnesse of Noradine his enemy be believed;
who honourably refused to invade the Kingdome whilest the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
solemnities of Baldwine were performing; and professed
the Christians had a just cause of sorrow,<note n="†" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 19. cap. 34.</note> having lost such a
King,<note place="margin">1163</note> whose equall for justice and valour the world did not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.

diffidence in himself about that article, but in case one should
meet with a sturdy man, who (as too many now-a-dayes) would
not trust faith on her single bond, except he have reason joyned
for security with her. Hereupon the Archbishop alledged
many strong arguments to prove it, and both rested well

                  <p>IN the Church of Jerusalem we find Almerick still Patriarch:
A Frenchman born, but little fit for the place, to which he was
preferred by the favour of Sibyll, Countesse of Flanders, the
Kings sister. Mean time the Church needed a Salick law, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
distaffs to meddle with mitres; and neither to be, nor to
make Patriarchs.</p>
                  <p>But the most remarkable Church-matter in this Kings reign,
was the clandestine christening of a Sultan of Iconium. And
more of his courtiers might have followed him,<note place="margin">Baron. in anno 1169.</note> but that his
Embassadours being at Rome, were offended there with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnesse
of Christians lives; which made them to exclaim,
<note n="†" place="margin">M. Paris, in anno 1169.</note> How can fresh and salt water flow from the same fountain?<note place="margin">1169</note>
This hath made many Pagans to step back, which had one foot in

and live so ill; breaking the Commandments against the Creed.</p>
                  <p>Not long after, the great master of the Assasines was really
disposed to receive our religion; and to this end sent an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
to King Almerick, which Embassadour was treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
slain by one of the Templars.<note place="margin">1173</note> The<note n="†" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 20. cap. 32.</note> King demanded this

enjoyned him penance, and had directed to send him to the
Pope, but stoutly refused to surrender him to the King. This
cruel murder imbittered the Assasines more desperately against
the Christians.</p>
                  <p>These Assasines were a precise sect of Mahometans, and had
in them the very spirits of that poysonous superstition. They
had some six cities, and were about fourty thousand in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
living near Antaradus in Syria. Over these was a chief
master, (Hell it self cannot subsist without a Beelzebub; so much

                  </argument>
                  <p>EGypt was a stage whereon the most remarkable passages in
the reign of King Almerick were acted. It will be necessary
therefore to premise somewhat concerning the estate of that
Kingdome at this time. Whilest the Turks thus lorded it in Syria
and the lesser Asia, the Saracen Caliph commanded in Egypt;
under whom two great Lords, Dargan and Sanar, fell out about
the Sultanie or Vice-royship of that land. But Sanar fearing he
should be worsted by Dargan, sued to Noradine King of the
Turks at Damascus for aid: who sent him an army of Turks, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the command of Syracon an experienced Captain, against
Sultan Dargan.<note place="margin">1165</note> So Dargan and Sanar met and fought. The
victory was Dargans; but he enjoyed it not long, being shortly
after slain by treachery, whereby Sanar recovered the Sultans
place. Mean time how strange was the voluptuous lethargy of
the Caliph Elhadach, to pursue his private pleasures, whilest his
Vice-royes thus fought under his nose, and imployed forrein
succours, yet he never regarded it; as if the tottering of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
had rocked him fast asleep!</p>
                  <p>Nor was he moved with that which followed, and more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerned him. For Syracon the Turkish Captain, whom
Sanar had gotten to come into Egypt, would not be intreated
to go home again; but seized on the city of Belbis, fortified it,
and there attended the arrivall of more Turks from Damascus,
for the conquest of Egypt. Which afterwards they performed;
the land being never completely cleared of them, till at last
they conquered the whole Kingdome, partly under this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racon,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94789:55"/>
and wholly under Saladine his nephew.</p>
                  <p>And here my discourse (by the leave of the reader) must a
little sally forth to treat of the danger of entertaining mercenary
souldiers. They may perchance be called in with a whistle, but
scarce cast out with a whip. If they be slugs, they indanger a
State by their slothfulnesse; if spirited men, by their activity.
Cesar Borgia, Machiavils idol, whose practice he maketh the
pattern of policy, saith,<note n="*" place="margin">

he counted that conquest to be none at all.</p>
                  <p>Yet good physick may be made of poyson well corrected:
They may sometimes be necessary evils; yea, good and service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to defend a land, if thus qualified: First, if they have no
command of castles, or place near about the Princes person;
for then they have a compendious way to treason, if they intend
it. Secondly, if they be not entertained in too great numbers,
but in such refracted degrees, that the natives may still have
the predominancy; for a surfeit of forrein supplies is a disease
incurable. Thirdly, if the Prince who imployeth them, hath
their wives, children, and estates in his own hands; which will
be both a caution and pawn for their fidelity, and will also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
their affections more cordially in the cause. Lastly, if
they be of the same religion with them, and fight against the
enemy of the religion of both; for then they are not purely
hirelings, but parties in part, and the cause doth at least mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concern them. I believe that it will scarcely be shown, that
the Protestants have turned tails and betrayed them they came
to assist.</p>
                  <p>We may observe, the Low-countreys have best thrived by
setting this trade of journey-men souldiers on work. Let them
thank God and the good English: for if Francies Duke of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou
with his Frenchmen had well succeeded, no doubt he would
have spread his bread with their butter. Next them the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
have sped best: for they have the trick, when they find it
equally dangerous to cashier their mercenary Generall or to
entertain him any longer, fairly to kill him; as they served

as for those hirelings which are to be last tried and least trusted,
we never have want of their help, and never have too much
of it.</p>

                  <p>Neverthelesse Almerick went on effectually in Egypt, and

would not so quickly quit the countrey; but goeth to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liph
of Babylon, (who was opposite to him of Egypt, each of

over all that were of the Saracen law) and offereth him
his means for the exstirpation of this schismaticall Caliph, and

                  <p>The motion was joyfully entertained, and Syracon with a

him a pension of fourty thousand ducates yearly for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooffull
assistance. But the King understanding that the Sultan
(how much soever he took upon him) was subject to a higher
Lord, would make no such bargain with him, but with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liph
himself; and therefore sent his Embassadours,<note n="*" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 19. cap. 16.</note> Hugh Earl
of Cesarea, and a Knight-Templar, along with the Sultan to
Caliph Elhadach then resident at Cairo. Arriving at his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
they passed through dark passages well guarded with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Ethiopians. Hence they were conducted into goodly open
<note n="*" place="margin">Idem, cap. 18.</note> courts of such beauty and riches, that they could not retain
the gravity of Embassadours, but were enforced to admire the
rarities they beheld. The farther they went, the greater the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94789:56"/>
state; till at last they were brought to the Caliphs own lodging.
Where entring the presence, the Sultan thrice prostrated himself
to the ground before the curtain behind which the Caliph sat.
Presently the traverse wrought with pearls was opened, and the
Caliph himself discovered, sitting with great majesty on a
throne of gold, having few of his most inward eunuchs about
him.</p>
                  <p>The Sultan humbly kissed his masters feet; and briefly told
him the cause of their coming, the danger wherein the land
stood, the profers he had made to King Almerick, desiring him
now to ratifie them, and in demonstration thereof to give his
hand to the Kings Embassadours. The Caliph demurred here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,
as counting such a gesture a diminution to his State; and at
no hand would give him his hand bare, but gave it in his glove.
To whom the resolute Earl of<note n="*" place="margin">Idem, cap. 19.</note> Cesarea; Sir, said he, Truth
seeketh no holes to hide it self. Princes that will hold covenant,
must deal openly and nakedly: give us therefore your bare
hand; we will make no bargain with your glove. He was loth
to do it; but necessity (a more imperious Caliph then himself at
this time) commanded it: and he did it at last, dismissing the
Christian Embassadours with such gifts as testified his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p>According to this agreement King Almerick cordially prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
his businesse, improving his utmost might to expell Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
with his Turks out of Egypt; whom he bade battel, and got
the day though he lost all his baggage: So that the conquest in
a manner was divided; the Turks gaining the wealth, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
the honour of the victory. Following his blow, he pinned
up the Turks afterward in the city of Alexandria, and forced
them to receive of him conditions of peace, and then returned
himself with honour to Askelon.<note place="margin">1167 Sept. 21.</note>

                  </argument>
                  <p>WHen a Crown is the prize of the game,<note place="margin">1168</note> we must never
expect fair play of the gamesters. King Almerick ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
looked on the beauty of the Kingdome of Egypt, he long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for it: and sought no longer to drive out the relicks of the
Turks, but to get Egypt to himself: And the next year, against
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94789:56"/>
the solemn league with the Caliph, invaded it with a great army.
He falsly pretended that the Caliph would make a private peace
with Noradine King of the Turks; and hence created his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.
For he hath a barren brain, who cannot fit himself with an
occasion if he hath a desire to fall out. But Gilbert master of the
Hospitallers chiefly stirred up the King to this warre, upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
that the city and countrey of Pelusium, if conquered, should
be given to his order. The Templars were much against the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
(one of their order was Embassadour at the ratifying of the
peace) and with much zeal protested against it, as undertaken
against oath and fidelity.</p>
                  <p>An oath being the highest appeal, perjury must needs be an
hainous sinne, whereby God is solemnly invited to be witnesse
of his own dishonour. And as bad is a God-mocking equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
For he that surpriseth truth with an ambush, is as bad an
enemy as he that fighteth against her with a flat lie in open field.
I know what is pleaded for King Almerick, namely, That
Christians are not bound to keep faith with idolaters, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers
of a false god, as the Egyptian Caliph was on the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But open so wide a window, and it will be in vain to shut
any doores. All contracts with Pagans may easily be avoided, if
this evasion be allowed. But what saith S. Hierome?<note n="†" place="margin">Non consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derandum cui, sed per quem jurave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, <hi>Comment. 17. Ezech.</hi>
                     </note> It matters
not to whom, but by whom we swear. And God to acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
knowing the Christians prosperity could not stand with his
justice after their perjury, frowned upon them. And from hence
authours date the constant ill successe of the Holy warre. For
though this expedition sped well at the first, and Almerick
wonne the city of Belbis or Pelusium, yet see what a cloud of
miseries ensued.</p>
                  <p>First, Noradine in his absence wasted and wonne places near
Antiochia at pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note n="†" place="margin">Centurist. Centur. 12. in Almerico.</note> Meller Prince of Armenia, a Christian, made a
covenant with Noradine, and kept it most constantly, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable
disadvantage of the King of Jerusalem. This act of
Meller must be condemned, but withall Gods justice admired.
Christians break their covenant with Saracens in Egypt, whilest
other Christians, to punish them, make and keep covenant with
Turks in Asia.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Saracens grew good souldiers on a sudden: who
were naked at first, and onely had bows; but now learned from
the Christians to use all offensive and defensive weapons. Thus
rude nations alwayes better themselves in fighting with a skilful
enemy. How good mark-men are the Irish now-a-dayes, which
some seventy years ago,<note n="†" place="margin">Morison, in the descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ireland, anno 1598.</note> at the beginning of their rebellions, had
three men to discharge a hand-gun!</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Almericks hopes of conquering Egypt were fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94789:57"/>
for after some victories he was driven out, and that
whole Kingdome conquered by Saladine (nephew to Syracon)
who killed the Caliph with his horse-mace as he came to do him
reverence, and made himself the absolutest Turkish King of
Egypt.<note place="margin">1173 May.</note> And presently after the death of Noradine, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the Turks at Damascus was by their consent bestowed
upon him. Indeed Noradine left a sonne, Mele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ala, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in part of his fathers dominions; but Saladine after his
death got all for himself. Thus rising men shall still meet with
more stairs to raise them; as those falling, with stumbling-blocks
to ruine them.</p>
                  <p>Mean time Jerusalem was a poor weather-beaten Kingdome,
bleak and open to the storm of enemies on all sides, having no
covert or shelter of any good friend near it, lying in the lions
mouth betwixt his upper and neather jaw; Damascus on the
North, and Egypt on the South; two potent Turkish Kingdoms,
united under a puissant Prince, Saladine. This made Almerick
send for succours into Europe: for now few voluntaries came to
this service; souldiers must be pressed with importunity. Our
Western Princes were prodigall of their pity, but niggardly of
their help: The heat of the warre in Palestine had cooled their
desires to go thither: which made these Embassadours to return
without supplies, having gone farre to fetch home nothing but
discomfort and despair.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, King Almerick himself wearied with whole volleys of
miseries, ended his life of a bloudy flux, having reigned eleven
full years, and was buried with his predecessours: Leaving two
children, Baldwine and Sibyll, by Agnes his first wife; and by

other Princes, because the world justly reported him valiant,

                     <p>Saladine fitteth himself with forrein forces. The
originall and great power of the Mammalukes,
with their first service.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the minority of King Baldwine, who was but thirteen years
old, Milo de Planci a Noble-man was Protectour of the
Realm: Whose pride and insolence could not be brooked, and
therefore he was stabbed at Ptolemais, and Reimund Count of
Tripoli chosen to succeed him.</p>
                  <p>Now Saladine seriously intendeth to set on the Kingdome of
Jerusalem, and seeketh to furnish himself with souldiers for that
service. But he perceived that the ancient nation of the Egyptians
had lasted so long, that now it ran dregs; their spirits being as
low as the countrey they lived in, and they fitter to make mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
and mechanicks then military men: For they were bred
in such soft imployments, that they were presently foundred
with any hard labour. Wherefore he sent to the Circassians by
the lake of Meotis, near Taurica Chersonesus, and thence bought
many slaves of able and active bodies. For it was a people born
in a hard countrey (no fewel for pleasure grew there nor was
brought thither) and bred harder; so that war was almost their
nature, with custome of continuall skirmishing with the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Tartars.</p>
                  <p>These slaves he trained up in military discipline, most of them
being Christians, once baptized; but afterwards untaught Christ,
they learned Mahomet, and so became the worse foes to religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for once being her friends. These proved excellent soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
and speciall horsemen, and are called Mammalukes. And
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94789:59"/>
surely the greatnesse of Saladine and his successours stood not
so much on the legs of their native Egyptians, as it leaned on
the staffe of these strangers. Saladine, and especially the Turkish
Kings after him, gave great power, and placed much trust in
these<note n="*" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 21. cap. 23.</note> Mammalukes: who lived a long time in ignorance of
their own strength; till at last they took notice of it, and scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any longer to be factours for another, they would set up for
themselves, and got the sovereignty from the Turkish Kings.
Thus Princes who make their subjects over-great, whet a knife
for their own throats. And posterity may chance to see the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Janizaries give the grand Seignor such a trip on the heel as
may tumble him on his back. But more largely of these Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malukes
usurping the Kingdome of Egypt (God willing) in its
proper place.</p>
                  <p>Thus Saladine having furnished himself with new souldiers,
went to handsel their valour upon the Christians; invaded the
Holy land, burning all the countrey before him, and raging in
the bloud of poor Christians, till he came and encamped about
Askelon.</p>
                  <p>Mean time whilest Reimund Count of Tripoli, Protectour of
the Kingdome, with Philip Earl of Flanders, &amp; the chief strength
of the Kingdome were absent in Celosyria, wasting the countrey
about Emissa and Cesarea, young King Baldwine lay close in
Askelon, not daring to adventure on so strong an enemy. With
whose fear Saladine encouraged, dispersed his army, some one
way, some another, to forrage the countrey.<note place="margin">1176 Nov. 25.</note> King Baldwine
courted with this opportunity, marched out privately, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
past four hundred horse, with some few footmen, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
his secure enemies, being six and twenty thousand. But
victory standeth as little in the number of souldiers, as verity in
the plurality of voices. The Christians got the conquest, and in
great triumph returned to Jerusalem.</p>
                  <p>This overthrow rather madded then daunted Saladine: Who
therefore to recover his credit, some moneths after with his
Mammalukes fell like a mighty tempest upon the Christians, as
they were parting the spoil of a band of Turks, whom they had
vanquished; put many to the sword, the rest to flight. Otto
grand Master of the Templars, and Hugh sonne in law to the
Count of Tripoli, were taken prisoners; and the King himself
had much ado to escape. And thus both sides being well wearied
with warre, they were glad to refresh themselves with a short
slumber of a truce solemnly concluded; and their troubled
estates breathed almost for the space of two years. Which truce
Saladine the more willingly embraced,<note place="margin">1179</note> because of a famine in
the Kingdome of Damascus, where it had scarce<note n="*" place="margin">Centurist. Cent. 12. in Baldvino 4.</note> rained for

discords.<note place="margin">1181</note> For the Kings mother, (a woman of a turbulent

affected the Crown for himself: which accusation this Earl
could never wholly wipe off. For slender and lean slanders
quickly consume themselves; but he that is branded with an
hainous crime, (though false) when the wound is cured, his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
will be killed with the scarre. Before we go further, let us
view this Earl Reimunds disposition, and we shall find him
marked to do mischief, and to ruine this Realm. He was sonne
to Reimund, grandchild to Pontius Earl of Tripoli, by Cecilie
the daughter of<note n="*" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 21. cap. 5.</note> Philip King of France, great-grandchild to Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram
first Earl of Tripoli, great-great-grandchild to Reimund
Earl of Tholose, one of speciall note among the primitive
adventurers in the Holy warre. His mother was Hodiern, third
daughter to Baldwine the second, King of Jerusalem. A man
whose stomach was as high as his birth; and very serviceable to
this State, whilest the sharpnesse of his parts were used against
the Turks; which at last turned edge against the Christians:
Proud, not able to digest the least wrong; and though long in
captivity amongst the Turks, yet a very truant in the school of
affliction, who never learned the lesson of patience: So revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
that he would strike his enemy, though it were through the
sides of religion and the Christian cause. For this present ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
of treason, good authours seem to be his compurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
for this at this time, though afterwards he discovered his
treacherous intents. And because he could not rise by his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
he made his service fall by him; and undid what he had
done for the publick good, because thereby he could not attain
his private ends. He commanded over the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli,
which was a territory of large extent, wherein he was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Lord. And by the way we may take notice of this as one
of the banes of the Kingdome of Jerusalem, That the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities
of Antioch, Tripoli, and Edessa (whilest it was Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian)
were branches of this Kingdome, but too big for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
For the Princes thereof on each petty distast would stand
on their guard, as if they had been subjects out of courtesie, not
conscience: and though they confessed they owed the King
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94789:60"/>
allegeance, yet they would pay no more then they thought fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themselves.</p>
                  <p>To return to King Baldwine; This suspicion of Earl Reimund,
though at first but a buzze, soon got a sting in the Kings head,
and he violently apprehended it. Whereupon Reimund coming
to Jerusalem, was by the way commanded to stay, to his great
disgrace. But some of the Nobility foreseeing what danger this
discord might bring, reconciled them with much labour. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
Baldwine ever after looked on this Earl with a jealous eye.
Jealousie, if it be fire in private persons, is wild-fire in Princes,
who seldome rase out their names whom once they have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in their black bills. And as the Italian proverb is, Suspicion
giveth a passe-port to faith to set it on packing; so this Earl find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself suspected, was never after cordially loyall, smother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his treachery in this Kings life, which afterwards broke forth
into an open flame.</p>

                  <p>THe Kingdome of Damascus being recovered of the famine,
Saladine having gotten his ends by the truce, would now
have the truce to end; and breaking it (as not standing with his
haughty designes) marched with a great army out of Egypt
through Palestine to Damascus, much spoiling the countrey.
And now having joyned the Egyptian with the Damascene
forces, re-entred the Holy land. But young King Baldwine
meeting him,<note place="margin">Centurist. Cent. 12. in Baldvino 4.</note> though but with seven hundred to twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
at the village Frobolt, overthrew him in a great battel; and
Saladine himself was glad with speedy flight to escape the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and by long marches to get him again to Damascus. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
he besieged Berytus both by sea and land; but the vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and valour of King Baldwine defeated his taking of it.</p>
                  <p>Saladine finding such tough resistance in the Holy land,
thought to make a better purchase by laying out his time in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopotamia.
Wherefore passing Euphrates, he wonne Charran
and divers other cities: and then returning, in Syria besieged
Aleppo, the strongest place the Christians had in that countrey;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94789:60"/>
so fortified by nature, that he had little hope to force it. But
treason will runne up the steepest ascent, where valour it self can
scarce creep: and Saladine with the battery of bribes made such
a breach in the loyalty of the governour, that he betrayed it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him.</p>
                  <p>Thus he cometh again into the Holy land more formidable
then ever before, carrying an army of terrour in the mentioning
of his name, which drove the poore Christians all into their fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
cities. As for King Baldwine, the leprosie had arrested him
prisoner, and kept him at home. Long had this Kings spirit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
this infirmity, swallowing many a bitter pang with a smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
face, and going upright with patient shoulders under the
weight of his disease. It made him put all his might to it, because
when he yielded to his sicknesse, he must leave off the managing
of the State; and he was loth to put off his royall robes before
he went to bed, a Crown being too good a companion for one to
part with willingly.<note place="margin">1183</note> But at last he was made to stoop, and retired
himself to a private life, appointing Baldwine his nephew (a
child of five years old) his successour; and Guy Earl of Joppa
and Askelon, this childs father in law, to be Protectour of the
Realm in his minority.</p>
                  <p>But soon after he revoked this latter act, and designed Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund
Earl of Tripoli for the Protectour. He displaced Guy,
because he found him of no over-weight worth, scarce passable
without favourable allowance, little feared of his foes, and as
little loved of his friends. The more martiall Christians sleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him as a slug, and neglected so lazy a leader that could not
keep pace with those that were to follow him: Yea, they refused
(whilest he was Protectour) at his command to fight with Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine;
and out of distast to their Generall, suffered their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
freely to forrage; which was never done before: For the
Christians never met any Turks wandring in the Holy land, but
on even terms they would examine their passe-port how suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
it was, and bid them battel.</p>
                  <p>Guy stormed at his displacing, and though little valiant,
yet very sullen, left the Court in discontent, went home, and
fortified his cities of Joppa and Askelon. What should King
Baldwine do in this case? Whom should he make Protectour?
Guy had too little, Reimund too much spirit for the place. He
feared Guy's cowardlinesse, lest he should lose the kingdome to
the Turks; and Reimunds treachery, lest he should get it for
himself. Thus anguish of mind and weaknesse of body (a dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
conquest for their united strengths, which single might suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice)
ended this Kings dayes, dying young at five and twenty
years of age. But if by the morning we may guesse at the day,

to exact any agreement herein out of the contrariety
of writers. We must also take notice, that besides the Latine
Patriarchs in Jerusalem and Antioch, there were also Grecian
Anti-Patriarchs appointed by the Emperour of Constantinople:
who having no temporall power nor profit by Church-lands,
had onely jurisdiction over those of the Greek Church.
We find not the chain of their succession, but here and there

both respects: Isaac the Grecian Emperour sent to make him
Patriarch of Constantinople; and Dositheus catching at both,
held neither, but betwixt two Patriarchs chairs fell to the
ground.</p>
                  <p>Antioch also had her Greek Patriarchs: As one Sotericus
displaced for maintaining some unsound tenets about our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour:
After him Theodorus Balsamon, the oracle of the
learned Law in his age. He compiled and commented on the
ancient Canons: and principally set forth the priviledges of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:94789:62"/>
Constantinople; listening, say the Romanists, to the least noise

condition he would prove the translation of the Patriarch to be
legall, which is forbidden by the Canons. Balsamon took upon
him to prove it: and a Lawyers brains will beat to purpose
when his own preferment is the fee. But herein he did but

Principality (a third part of the Kingdome of Jerusalem) to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladine;
and in his own person under a vizard, assisted him in this
siege.</p>
                  <p>Out of the city marched the Templars and Hospitallers,<note place="margin">May. 1.</note>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94789:62"/>
Yet they gave welnigh a valuable consideration for their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

Tripoli, whether out of fear the Christians might prevail, or
remorse of conscience, or discontent, not finding that respect
he expected of Saladine, (who had learned that politick maxime
To give some honour, no trust to a fugitive) reconciled himself
to King Guy; and sorry for his former offence, returned to the
Christians.</p>
                  <p>King Guy hereupon gathering the whole strength of his
weak Kingdome to do their last devoir, determined to bid Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladine

turned the scales to the Turks side. More Christians (thirsty

Castile was slain, with most of the Templars and Hospitallers.

Montferrat were taken prisoners; and also Guy the King, who
saw the rest of his servants slain before his eyes, onely obtaining
of Saladine the life of his schoolmaster. Yea, in this battel the
flower of the Christian chevalrie was cut down: and what was
most lamented, the Crosse (saith Matthew Paris) which freed
men from the captivity of their sinnes, was for mens sinnes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
captive. Most impute this overthrow to the Earl of Tripoli,
who that day commanded a great part of the Christian army,
and is said of some treacherously to have fled away. But when
a great action miscarrieth, the blame must be laid on some; and
commonly it lighteth on them who formerly have been found
false, be it right or wrong: So impossible is it for him who once
hath broken his credit by treason, ever to have it perfectly joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
again. It increaseth the suspicion, because this Earl, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
found dead in his bed, (as some say) was circumcised.</p>
                  <p>Victorious Saladine, as he had thrown a good cast, played it
as well; in a moneth conquering Berytus, Biblus, Ptolemais, and
all the havens (Tyre excepted) from Sidon to Askelon. He used
his conquest with much moderation, giving lives and goods to
all, and forcing no Christians to depart their cities, save onely the
Latines. This his gentlenesse proceeded from policy, well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that if the Christians could not buy their lives cheap, they
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:94789:63"/>
would sell them dear, and fight it out to the uttermost. Aske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon
was stout, and would not surrender. Wherefore Saladine,
loth with the hazard of so long a siege to check his fortune in the
full speed, left it, and went to Jerusalem, as to a place of lesse
difficulty and more honour to conquer.</p>

playing out of a desperate game which must be lost: Their foes
near, their friends farre off; and those willing to pity, unable

                  <p>Saladine possessed of Jerusalem, turned the churches into sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
sparing onely that of the Sepulchre for a great summe of

it all over with rose-water, as if he would wash it from

with Roger Hovedens witty descant on the time:<note n="*" place="margin">Loco priùs citato.</note> When Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
was wonne by the Christians, and afterwards when it was
lost, an Urbane was Pope of Rome, a Frederick Emperour of
Germany, an Heraclius Patriarch of Jerusalem. But by his leave,
though the first of his observations be true, the second is a flat
falsity, the third a foul mistake, and may thus be mended: (It is
charity to lend a crutch to a lame conceit) When the Crosse
was taken from the Persians, Heraclius was Emperour: and
when it was taken from the Turks, Heraclius was Patriarch.
Thus these curious observations (like over-small watches) not
one of a hundred goeth true. Though it cannot be denyed, but
the same name (as Henry of England, one the win-all, another
the loose-all in France) hath often been happy and unhappy in
founding and confounding of Kingdomes. But such nominall
toyes are rags not worth a wise mans stooping to take them up.</p>

plausible errand into remote parts, there to seek for themselves
an honourable grave. To this end Isaacius by the perswasions of
some spurred on Conrade (free enough of himself to any noble

of the Christians. Conrade was sensible of their plot, but suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

Emmanuel was Emperour in Greece: Who having reigned thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

observing the Devils rule, That it is the best way for those who
have been bad, to be still worse, fencing his former villanies by
committing new ones, held by tyranny what he had gotten by
usurpation; till having lived in the bloud of others, he died in his

he received all the cruelties which might be expected from ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile

                  <p>Then Isaacius Angelus, of the Imperiall bloud, was placed

one of the wisest men in the world, though his person was
most contemptible; so true it is none can guesse the jewel by
the casket) dismantled all his cities in the Holy land save
some frontier-places, rasing their walls and forts, that they
were not tenable with an army. For he feared if the Dutch
wonne these places, they would not easily be driven out:
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94789:67"/>
whereas now being naked from shelter, he would weary them
with set battels, having men numberless, and those near at hand;
and so he would tame the Romane Eagle by watching him, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

no Paradox to say, That in some case the strength of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
doth consist in the weaknesse of it. And hence it is, that
our English Kings have suffered Time, without disturbing her

which whilest they were standing in their strength, were
but the nurseries of rebellion. And now, as<note n="†" place="margin">

(being quickly stabbed with set battels) which in the Low-countreys
hath already outlived the grand climactericall of
threescore and ten years.</p>
                  <p>But Frederick the Emperour, being now entring into the
Holy land, was to the great grief of all Christians suddenly
taken away, being drowned in the river of Saleph; a river (such
is the envie of Barbarisme obscuring all places) which cannot
accurately be known at this day, because this new name is a
stranger to all ancient maps. If he went in to wash himself, as
some write, he neither consulted with his health nor honour:
Some say, his horse foundred under him as he passed the water;
others, that he fell from him. But these severall relations, as
variety of instruments, make a dolefull con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

years of age.<note n="†" place="margin">Lib. 4. cap. 13.</note> Neubrigensis conceiveth that this his sudden
death was therefore inflicted on him, because in his youth
he fought against the Popes and Church of Rome: But I
wonder that he seeing an Emperour drowned in a ditch, durst
adventure into the bottomlesse depths of Gods counsels.
Let it content us to know that oftentimes heaven blasteth
those hopes which bud first and fairest; and the feet of mighty
Monarchs do slip, when they want but one step to their enemies
throne.</p>
                  <p>After his death Frederick Duke of Suevia, his second
sonne, undertook the conduct of the army. Now the Turks
conceiving grief had steeped and moistened these Pilgrimes
hearts, gave them a sudden charge, in hope to have overthrown
them. But the valiant Dutch, who though they had scarce
wiped their eyes had scoured their swords, quickly forced
them to retire. Then Frederick took the citie of Antioch,<note place="margin">Iune 21.</note>
which was easily delivered unto him, and his hungry souldiers
well refreshed by the citizens, being as yet for the most part
Christians. Marching from hence in set battel, he overthrew
Dordequin Generall of Saladines forces, slew four thousand,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94789:68"/>
and took a thousand prisoners with little losse of his own men;
and so came to the city of Tyre, where he buried the corpse of
his worthy father in the Cathedrall Church, next the tomb of
the learned Origen; and Guilelmus Tyrius the worthy Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
preached his funerall sermon. We may hear his sorrowfull
army speaking this his Epitaph unto him;

behold, Geoffrey Lusignan King Guy's brother (left for the

against the Turks.</p>
                  <p>Richard was well stored with men, the bones, and quickly
got money, the sinews of warre; by a thousand Princely skills
gathering so much coin as if he meant not to return, because
looking back would unbow his resolution. To Hugh Bishop of

any were able to buy it) rather then he would be burthen some to
his subjects for money. But take this as he spake it, for a flourish:
for pretending he had lost his old, he made a new seal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he squeezed his subjects, and left a deep impression in their
purses; forcing them to have all their<note n="†" place="margin">Speed, in Richard the first,</note> instruments new-sealed,
which any way concerned the Crown.</p>
                  <p>Having now provided for himself, he forgot not his younger
brother John Earl of Morton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who was to stay behind him; an
active man, who if he misliked the maintenance was cut for him,
would make bold to carve for himself: Lest therefore straitned
for means he should swell into discontent, King Richard gave
him many Earldomes and honours, to the yearly value of four
thousand marks. Thus he received the golden saddle, but none
of the bridle of the Common-wealth: honour and riches were
heaped upon him, but no place of trust and command. For the
King deputed William Bishop of Ely his Viceroy; choosing him
for that place rather then any lay-Earl, because a Coronet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
may swell into a Crown, but never a Mitre: For a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie-mans
calling made him uncapable of usurpation in his own
person.</p>
                  <p>Thus having settled matters at home, he set forth with
many of our nation, which either ushered or followed him.

                  <p>Yea, the interviews of equall Princes have ever been observed
dangerous. Now Princes measure their equality not by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of their dominions, but by the absoluteness of their power;
so that he that is supreme and independent in his own countrey,
counteth himself equall to any other Prince how great soever.
Perchance some youthfull Kings may disport and solace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
one in anothers company, whilest as yet pleasure is all the
elevation of their souls: But when once they grow sensible of
their own greatnesse, (a lesson they will quickly learn, and shall
never want teachers) then emulation will be betwixt them;
because at their meeting they cannot so go in equipage, but one
will still be the foremost: Either his person will be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
or carriage more courtlike, or attendance more accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
or attire more fashionable, or something will either
be or conceived to be more majesticall in one then the other:
And corrivalls in honour count themselves eclipsed by every
beam of state which shineth from their competitour. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the best way to keep great Princes together, is to keep
them asunder, accommodating their businesse by Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,

lately without mercy he had simoniacally extorted a
masse of money from the Prelates of England. At Messana
in Sicilie these two Kings met again: where to complete King
Richards joy, behold his Navie there safely arriving, which
with much difficulty and danger had fetched a compasse about
Spain.</p>
                  <p>And now King Richard by his own experience grew sensible
of the miseries which merchants and mariners at sea underwent,
being alwayes within few inches, often within an hairs breadth
of death. Wherefore now touched with remorse of their piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
case, he resolved to revoke the law of Wracks, as a law so
just that it was even unjust. For formerly both in England and
Normandie, the<note n="†" place="margin">Bracto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n, lib. 2. cap. 5.</note> Crown was intituled to shipwrackt goods,

of such pitifull accidents, and to strip poore mariners
out of those rags of their estates which the mercy and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
of the waves and winds had left them. And therefore on

Archbishops and Bishops, he for ever<note n="†" place="margin">

                  <p>Tancred at this time was King of Sicilie; a bastard born:
and no wonder if, climbing up the throne the wrong way, he
shaked when he sate down. Besides, he was a Tyrant; both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the dowrie and imprisoning the person of Joan wife to
William late King of Sicilie, and sister to King Richard. But
in what a case was he now, having two such mighty Monarchs
come unto him! To keep them out, was above his power, to
let them in, against his will. Well he knew it was wofull to
lie in the rode where great armies were to passe: For power
knoweth no inferiour friend; and the land-lord commonly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
his rent, sometimes his land, where the tenant is too potent
for him.</p>
                  <p>At last he resolved (how wisely or honestly let others
judge) openly to poise himself indifferent betwixt these two
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:94789:70"/>
Kings, secretly applying himself to the French: which King
Richard quickly discovered, as dissembling goeth not long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
before a judicious eye.</p>
                  <p>Mean time the citizens of Messana did the English much
wrong, if not by the command, with the consent of the King.
For though it be unjust to father the base actions of unruly
people on their Prince; yet Tancred not punishing his people
for injuring the English, when he might and was required
thereunto, did in effect justifie their insolencies, and adopt
their deeds to be his. Wherefore King Richard to avenge
himself, took Messana by assault, seized on most forts in the
Island, demanding satisfaction for all wrongs done to him and
his sister. Tancred though dull at first, now pricked with the
sword, came off roundly with many thousand ounces of gold;
and seeing, as the case stood, his best thrift was to be prodigall,
gave to our King what rich conditions soever he demanded.</p>
                  <p>Worse discords daily encreased betwixt the King of France
and England; King Richard slighting the King of France his
sister whom he had promised to marry, and expressing more
affection to Beringaria daughter to the King of Navarre. Some
Princes interposing themselves in this breach, rather asswaged
the pain then removed the malady: So dangerous are ruptures
betwixt great ones, whose affections perchance by the mediation
of friends may be brought again to meet, but never to unite and
incorporate. King Philip thinking to forestall the market of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and take up all for himself, hasted presently to Ptolemais:
Richard followed at his leisure, and took Cyprus in his way.
Isaac (or Cursac) reigned then in Cyprus; who, under Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus
the Grecian Emperour (when every factious Noble-man
snatched a plank out of that shipwracked Empire) seized on this
Island, and there tyrannized as a reputed King. Some falsely
conceived him a Pagan: and his faith is suspected, because his
charity was so bad; killing the English that landed there, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
so much man as to pity a woman, and to suffer the sea-sick
Lady Beringaria to come on shore. But King Richard speedily
overran the Island, honoured Isaac with the magnificent capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of silver fetters; yet giving his daughter liberty and prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
usage. The Island he pawned to the Templars for ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
And because Cyprus by antiquity was celebrated as the
seat of Venus, that so it might prove to him, in the joyous
moneth of May he solemnly took to wife his beloved Lady Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringaria.</p>

with a running pull to bear the city away, yet he found it staked

                  <p>This mortality notwithstanding, the siege still continued.
And now the Christians and Turks, like two fencers long play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together, were so well acquainted with the blows and
guards each of other, that what advantage was taken betwixt
them was meerly casuall, never for want of skill, care, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
on either side. It helped the Christians not a little, that a
concealed Christian within the citie, with letters unsubscribed
with any name, gave them constant and faithfull intelligence of
the remarkable passages amongst the Turks.</p>
                  <p>No Prince in this siege deserved more then Leopoldus Duke
of Austria; who fought so long in assaulting this city, till his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour

and two hundred and fifty<note n="†" place="margin">Matth. Paris. in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no 1191.</note> scorpions, which were
to be imployed in the poysoning of Christians) and now the
siege of Ptolemais more fiercely prosecuted. But all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
made not so wide a breach in that cities walls, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie

the Turks despairing of succour,<note place="margin">Iuly 13.</note> their victuals wholly spent,
yielded up the city by Saladines consent, on condition to be
themselves safely guarded out of it: all Christian prisoners Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladine

                  <p>The houses which were left, with the spoil and prisoners,
were equally divided betwixt Philip and Richard. Whereat

                  <p>Here the English cast down the ensignes of Leopoldus
Duke of Austria, which he had advanced in a principall tower
in Ptolemais; and as some say, threw them into the jakes.
The Duke, though angry at heart, forgot this injury till
he could remember it with advantage; and afterwards made
King Richard pay soundly for this affront. It is not good to
exasperate any, though farre inferiour: for, as the fable telleth
us, the beetle may annoy the eagle, and the mouse befriend the
lion.</p>
                  <p>When the city was taken, it grieved the Christians not a
little that their faithfull<note n="†" place="margin">Hoveden, in Rich. 1. pag. 694.</note> correspondent, who advised them by
his letters, could no where be found: Pity it was that Rahabs
red lace was not tied at his window. But indeed it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that he was dead before the surrendring of the city.
Greater was the grief that the Crosse did no where appear,
either carelessely lost, or enviously concealed by the Turks.
Whilest the Christians stormed hereat, Saladine required a
longer respite for the performance of the conditions. But
King Richard would not enlarge him from the strictnesse of
what was concluded; conceiving that was in effect to forfeit the
victory back again. Besides, he knew he did it onely to gain
time to fetch new breath: and if he yielded to him, his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
had not been thanked, but his fear upbraided, as if he durst
not deny him. Yea, in anger King Richard commanded all

                  <p>MEan time the Christians were rent asunder with faction:
Philip the French King, Odo Duke of Burgundy, Leopold
Duke of Austria, most of the Dutch, all the Genoans and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars
siding with King Conrade; King Richard, Henry Count
of Champaigne, the Hospitallers, Venetians, and Pisans taking
part with King Guy. But King Conrades side was much weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the sudden departure of the French King; who eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
dayes after the taking of Ptolemais returned home,<note place="margin">Iuly 31.</note> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
want of necessaries, indisposition of body, distemper of the
climate, though the greatest distemper was in his own passions.
The true cause of his departure was, partly envie, because the
sound of King Richards fame was of so deep a note that it
drowned his; partly<note n="†" place="margin">Matthew Paris. p. 220.</note> covetousnesse, to seize on the dominions
of the Earl of Flanders lately dead; Flanders lying fitly to make
a stable for the fair palace of France. If it be true what<note n="†" place="margin">Speed, out of Hoveden, in Rich. 1.</note> some

Prince.</p>
                  <p>His own souldiers disswaded him from returning, beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him not to stop in so glorious a race, wherein he was new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
started: Saladine was already on his knees, and would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
be brought on his face, if pursued. If he played the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift

                  <p>All would not do, Philip persisted in his old plea, How the
life of him absent would be more advantagious to the cause,
then the death of him present; and by importunity got leave to
depart, solemnly swearing not to molest the King of Englands
dominions.</p>
                  <p>Thus the King of France returned in person, but remained
still behind in his instructions, which he left (with his army) to
the Duke of Burgundy; to whom he prescribed both his path
and his pace, where and how he should go. And that Duke
moved slowly, having no desire to advance the work where
King Richard would carry all the honour. For in those acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
wherein severall undertakers are compounded together,
commonly the first figure for matter of credit maketh ciphres
of all the rest. As for King Philip, being returned home, such
was the itch of his ambition, he must be fingering of the King

of Englands territories, though his hands were bound by oath
to the contrary.</p>

whether for want of opportunity, or shortnesse of his reign,
being most spent in a truce. He more pleased himself in the style
of Prince of Tyre then King of Jerusalem; as counting it more
honour to be Prince of what he had, then King of what he
had not.</p>
                  <p>And now the Christians began every where to build: The
Templars fortified Gaza; King Richard repaired and walled
Ptolemais, Porphyria, Joppa, and Askelon. But alas! this short
prosperity, like an Autumne-spring, came too late and was gone
too soon to bring any fruit to maturity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:94789:74"/>It was now determined they should march towards Jerusalem:
for all this while they had but hit the but; that Holy City was
the mark they shot at. Richard led the vantguard of English;
Duke Odo commanded in the main battel over his French;
James of Auvergne brought on the Flemings and Brabanters in
the rere. Saladine, serpent-like, biting the heel, assaulted the rere,
not far from Bethlehem; when the French and English wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about, charged the Turks most furiously. Emulation, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
poyson, was here a cordiall, each Christian nation striving
not onely to conquer their enemies, but to overcome their
friends in the honour of the conquest. King Richard seeking to
put his courage out of doubt, brought his judgement into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
being more prodigall of his person then beseemed a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
One<note n="†" place="margin">P. Aemyl. in Phil. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusto, p. 180.</note> wound he received, but by losi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his spirits, and laid about him like a mad-man. The Christians
got the victory, without the losse of any of number or note,
save James of Auvergne, who here died in the bed of honour:
But more of the Turks were slain then in any battel for fourty
years before.</p>
                  <p>Had the Christians presently gone to Jerusalem, probably
they might have surprised it, whilest the Turks eyes were
muffled and blindfolded in the amazement of this great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.
But this opportunity was lost by the backwardnesse and
unwillingnesse of King Richard and the English, say the
<note n="†" place="margin">P. Aemyl. ibidem.</note> French writers. To cry quits with them, our<note n="†" place="margin">Matth. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. in Rich. 1. p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 216.</note> English au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
impute it to the envie of the French; who would have
so glorious an action rather left undone, then done by the
English. They complain likewise of the treachery of Odo
Duke of Burgundie, who more carefull of his credit then his
conscience, was choked with the shame of the sinne he had
swallowed, and died for grief, when his intelligence with the
Turks was made known. This cannot be denyed, that Saladine
sent (term them bribes or presents) both to our King and the
French Duke, and they received them: no wonder then if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them herein had a good name, when they traded with
such familiars. But most hold King Richard attempted not Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
because as a wise architect, he would build his victories so
as they might stand, securing the countrey as he went; it being
senselesse to besiege Jerusalem a straggling city, whilest the
Turks as yet were in possession of all the sea-ports and strong
forts thereabout.</p>

                     <p>The little-honourable peace King Richard made
with Saladine; Of the value of Reliques.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BUt bad news out of Europe shaked his steadiest resolutions,
hearing how William Bishop of Ely, his Vice-roy in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
used unsufferable insolencies over his subjects: So hard it
is for one of base parentage to personate a King without over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
his part, Also he heard how the King of France and John
Earl of Morton his own brother, invaded his dominions; ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Pope in their belly, dispensing with their oath to the
contrary. Besides, he saw this warre was not a subject capable
of valour to any purpose; the Venetians, Genoans, Pisans and
Florentines being gone away with their fleets, wisely shrinking
themselves out of the collar, when they found their necks
wrung with the hard imployment. Hereupon he was forced
first to make the motion of (in plain terms, to begge) peace of
Saladine.</p>
                  <p>Let Saladine now alone to winne, having all the game in his
own hand. Well knew he how to shoot at his own ends, and to
take aim by the exigencies wherein he knew King Richard was
plunged. For he had those cunning gypsies about him, who
could read in King Richards face what grieved his heart; and by
his intelligencers was certified of every note-worthy passage in
the English army. Upon these terms therefore or none (beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of peace shall never be choosers of their conditions) a truce
for three (some say, five) years might be concluded, That the
Christians should demolish all places they had walled since the
taking of Ptolemais; which was in effect to undo what with
much charge they had done. But such was the tyranny of King
Richards occasions, forcing him to return, that he was glad to
embrace those conditions he hated at his heart.</p>
                  <p>Thus the voyage of these two Kings, begun with as great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of the undertakers as expectation of the beholders, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

                  <p>And now a little to solace my self and the reader with a merry
digression, after much sorrow and sad stories; King Richard did
one thing in Palestine which was worth all the cost and pains of
his journey, namely, He redeemed from the Turks a chest full of
holy Reliques (which they had gotten at the taking of Jerusalem)
so great, as<note n="†" place="margin">Matth. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. in Rich. 1. p. 222.</note> four men could scarce carry any way. And though

                  <p>Many Historians (like some painters, which rather shew their
skill in drawing a curious face then in making it like to him
whom it should resemble) describe Princes rather what they
should be then what they were; not shewing so much their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
as their own wits. But finding this Saladine so generally
commended of all writers, we have no cause to distrust this his
true character.</p>
                  <p>His wisdome was great, in that he was able to advise; and
greater, in that he was willing to be advised: Never so wedded
to his own resolves, but on good ground he would be divorced
from them. His valour was not over-free, but would well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the spurre when need required. In his victories he was
much beholden to the advantage of season, place, and number;
and seldome wrested the garland of honour from an arm as
strong as his own. He ever marched in person into the field,
remembring that his predecessours, the Caliphs of Egypt, brake
themselves by using Factours, and imploying of Souldans. His
temperance was great, diet sparing, sleep moderate, not to pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
nature, but to keep it in repair. His greatest recreation was
variety and exchange of work. Pleasures he rather sipped then
drank off; sometimes, more to content others then please him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Wives he might have kept sans number, but stinted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to one or two; using them rather for posterity then wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse.
His justice to his own people was remarkable; his
promise with his enemies generally well kept. Much he did tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
in mercy: Fierce in fighting, mild in conquering; and
having his enemies in his hand, pleased himself more in the
power then act of revenge. His liberality would have drained
his treasure, had it not had a great and quick spring, those
Eastern parts being very rich. Serviceable men he would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
on any rate; and sometimes his gifts bare better propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his own greatnesse then the receivers deserts. Vast
bribes he would give to have places betrayed unto him, and
often effected that with his gold which he could not do with
his steel. Zealous he was in his own religion, yet not violent

was admirable; as being neither ignorant of his greatnesse, nor

                  <p>AFter his death, Almerick Lusignan, brother to King Guy,
was in the right of his wife crowned King of Jerusalem:
For he married Isabella the Relict of Henry the last King. This
Lady was four times married: first, to Humphred Prince of
Thorone; then to the three successive Kings of Jerusalem, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade,
Henry, and this Almerick. He was also King of Cyprus;
and the Christians in Syria promised themselves much aid from
the vicinity of that Island. But though he was near to them,
he was far from helping them, making pleasure all his work;
being an idle, lazy, worthlesse Prince. But I trespasse on that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick

                  <p>In his time, Henry Emperour of Germany, indicted by his
conscience for his cruelty against King Richard, seeking to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume
his name in the nostrils of the world, which began to be
unsavourie, set on foot another voyage to the Holy land.<note place="margin">1197</note> Pope
Celestine the third sent his Legates about to promote this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
shewing how God himself had sounded the alarm by the
dissention of the Turks: Jerusalem now might be wonne with
the blows of her enemies; onely an army must be sent, not so
much to conquer as to receive it. Generall of the Pilgrimes
was Henry Duke of Saxony; next him, Frederick Duke of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria,
Herman Landtgrave of Thuringia, Henry Palatine of
Rhene, Conrade Archbishop of Mentz, Conrade Archbishop of

Richard, (it seemeth by this, it was the last five years) the Pope
dispensing therewith; who can make a peace nets to hold others,
but a cobweb for himself to break through. The city Berytus

suddenly died, the root which nourished this voyage, and
then the branches withered. Henry also Duke of Saxony, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
of this army, was slain. And Conrade Archbishop of

choice of a new Emperour; knowing he could more profitably
use his voice in Germany then his arms in Syria. Other Captains

to Constantinople; They conquer the Grecian
Empire.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THis truce notwithstanding, another army of Pilgrims was
presently provided for Syria: The Tetrarchs whereof were
Baldwine Earl of Flanders, Dandalo the Venetian Duke, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald
Earl of Champaigne, Boniface Marquesse of Montferrat,
with many other Nobles.</p>
                  <p>Leave we them a while taking the city of Jadera in Istria for
the Venetians. Mean time if we look over into Greece, we shall
find Isaac Angelus the Emperour deposed, thrust into prison, his
eyes put out, (the punishment there in fashion) so that he ended
his dayes before he ended his life, by the cruelty of Alexius An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelus
his brother, who succeeded him.</p>
                  <p>But young Alexius, Isaac Angelus his sonne, with some Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
Noble-men, came to the courts of most Western Princes
to beg assistance to free his father and expell the tyrant. He so
deported himself, that each gesture was a net to catch mens
good will; not seeking their favour by losing himself, but
though he did bow, he would not kneel: so that in his face one
might read a pretty combat betwixt the beams of majesty and
cloud of adversity. To see a Prince in want, would move a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
charity. Our Western Princes tendered his case, which
they counted might be their own; their best right lying at the
mercy of any stronger usurper. Young Alexius so dressed his
meat, that he pleased every mans palate; promising for their
succours to disingage the French from their debts to the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian;
promising the Venetian satisfaction for the wrongs done
them by the Grecians; and bearing the Pope in hand he would
reduce the Eastern Churches into his subjection: things which
he was little<note n="*" place="margin">Nicetas.</note> able to perform. But well may the statute of
Bankrupt be sued out against him who cannot be rich in promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
These his fair profers prevailed so farre, that the Pope
commanded, and other Princes consented, that this army of
Pilgrimes levied for the Holy land, should be imployed against
the usurping Grecian Emperour. Many taxed his Holinesse for
an unjust steward of the Christian forces, to expend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Grecians, which were to be laid out against the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels:
Especially now when Palestine, through the dissension of
the Turks, offered it self into the Christians arms to be regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Others thought the Pope took the right method; because
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:94789:79"/>
he which should winne Jerusalem must begin at Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople:
And by this warre the Grecian Empire, which was the
bridge to Syria, would be made good, and secured for the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of Pilgrimes. The souldiers generally rejoyced at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
of their service: for the barren warres in Syria starved
the undertakers; and a cook himself cannot lick his fingers
where no meat is dressed. There nothing but naked honour
was to be gotten, here honour clothed with spoil; the usurpers
treasure would make brave scrambling amongst them: And it
was good plowing up of that ground which had long laien
fallow.</p>
                  <p>Setting sail from Jadera (which city they had subdued to the
Venetian, forcing them to pay three thousand<note n="*" place="margin">Blondus, l. 6. Decad. 2. p. 270.</note> cony-skins
yearly for tribute to that State) like good fensers they strook
at the head, and made for Constantinople: Which they quickly
took,<note place="margin">1203 Iuly 17.</note> after some hot skirmishes. Alexius Angelus the usurper,
with his wife, whores, and treasure, fled away. Blind Isaac
Angelus was fetched out of prison; he and young Alexius his
sonne saluted joynt Emperours. Which brittle honour of theirs
was quickly broken: For soon after the father died, being
brought into an open place, kept before in a close pent dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon;
and having long fasted from good air, he now got his
death by surfeiting on it. His sonne was villanously strangled
by Alexius Ducas, called from his beetle brow Mur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>iphlus: One
of base parentage, who was tumultuously chosen Emperour by
the people. This Ducas offered some affronts to the Latines
which lay before Constantinople in their ships.<note place="margin">1204 Apr. 21.</note> Wherefore,
and also because they were not payed for their former service,
they the second time assaulted the city, and took it by main
force; killing none, but robbing all; ravishing women, and using
a thousand insolencies. Some fled for their succour to the shrines
of Saints: But the Sanctuaries needed sanctuaries to protect
themselves, the souldiers as little respecting place, as formerly
age or sex: not standing on any reverence to the Saints, they
stood upon them, making footstools of their images and
statues.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>POpe Innocent the third having lately learned the trick of
imploying the army of Pilgrimes in by-services,<note place="margin">1206</note> began now
to set up a trade thereof. For two years after he levied a great
number of them, whom he sent against the Albingenses in
France. These were reputed hereticks, whom his Holinesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to root out with all cruelty; that good shepherd know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no other way to bring home a wandring sheep then
by worrying him to death. He fully and freely promised the
undertakers the self-same Pardons and Indulgences as he did to
those who went to conquer the Holy land; and very conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
requested their aid onely for fourty dayes, hoping to
chop up these Albingenses at a bit. Though herein he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and they stuck in his and his successours teeth for fifty
years together. The place being nearer, the service shorter,
the work lesse, the wages the same with the voyage into Syria,
many entred themselves in this imployment, and neglected the
other.</p>
                  <p>We will trace this army by their footsteps, and our penne
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:94789:80"/>
must wait on their swords. And I hope that his Holinesse, who
absolved many of their vows from Palestine, and commuted
them into a journey into France, will also of his goodnesse dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
with my veniall digression herein, in prosecuting their
actions. Yea indeed, I need not his dispensation, being still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
on my own subject, this also being styled, The Holy
War, The warre for the Crucifix, The army of the Church;
the souldiers also bearing the badge of the Crosse on their coat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armour.</p>
                  <p>But first let us throughly examine what these Albingenses
were, and what they held: a question that will quit the cost in
studying it.</p>
                  <p>They were a younger house of the Waldenses, and branched
from them; not different in doctrine, but later in time, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in place: so called from the countrey Albigeois in France,
where they lived.</p>
                  <p>I find three grand different opinions of Authours concerning
them.</p>
                  <p>First,<note n="*" place="margin">Io. Paul. Perin. De Albing. lib. 1. cap. 1.</note> Some make them to have been very monsters in life and
doctrine; so that the heaviest punishment was too light for them.
And this is the generall voice of most writers in that age, and all
Romanists in our dayes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others clean contrary hold, That these Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

have done) were onely the true Church of God in that age,
whilest all others being corrupted with abominable superstition,
were no true Church at all. These alone were Gods Virgins, his
Witnesses in sackcloth, his Woman in the wilderness, his sealed
ones, his seven thousand whose knees were not suppled with the
Baalisme of that age. This is the expresse opinion of some strict
Protestants; and of some who speak it not out, yet mutter it to
themselves.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A third sort<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>White, in his Reply to Fisher, pag.</hi> 104. 105. The Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the same doctrine in substance with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.</note> explode this opinion, as trespassing on
Divine providence; that God who neither slumbereth nor
sleepeth, should be in so long a lethargie as to suffer hell to eat
up his heaven on earth for so many years together, leaving no
true Church but so small a company of such simple people.
They conceive that the maintainers hereof engage themselves
in a labyrinth of difficulties, hanging too great a weight on so
slender a string, in making such an handfull of men the onely
Church for so long continuance. More moderately therefore
they hold, That these Albingenses were a purer part of the
Church; and though guilty of some errours, (as there must be
a dawning before the day) and charged with more, yet they
maintained the same * doctrine in ore, which since Luthers time
was refined: So that the main body of the Church visible at
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:94789:81"/>
this time was much in dilapidations, whilest the Albingenses, as
an innermost chapell thereof, was best in repair.</p>

                  <p>ABout the year 1160, Peter Waldo a merchant of Lyons,
rich in substance and learning (for a lay-man) was walking
and talking with his friends, when one of them suddenly fell
down dead. Which lively spectacle of mans mortality so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
the soul of this Waldo, that instantly he resolved on a
strict reformation of his life: Which to his power he performed;
translating some books of the Bible; instructing such as resorted
to him in godlinesse of life; teaching withall, That Purgatory,
Masses, dedication of Temples, worshipping of Saints, prayers
for the dead, were inventions of the devil, and snares of avari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

That Monkery was a stinking carrion, the Church of Rome the
whore of Babylon, the Pope that Antichrist Paramount: He
sharply lanced the vitious ulcers of Clergie-mens lives, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their pride and luxury. Soon got he many followers, both
because novelty is a forcible loadstone, and because he plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
relieved his poor disciples; and those that use that trade shall
never want custome.</p>
                  <p>The Archbishop of Lyons hearing such doctrines broched as
were high treason against the Triple crown, ferreted Waldo and
his sectaries out of Lyons and the countrey thereabouts. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
is the bellows of the Gospel, to blow every spark into
a flame. This their division proved their multiplication. Some
fled into the Alpes, living there on so steep hills, and in so deep
holes, that their enemies were afraid to climbe or dive after
them. Here they had the constant company of the snow: And
as it by the height of the hils was protected from the sun-beams,
so they from the scorching of persecution, even to Luthers time.
Others fled into Picardy, Flanders, England, Alsatia, Bohemia,

thereof. But Martyrs ashes are the best compost to manure the
Church: for others were wonne to their opinion, by behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their constancy and patience. Strange that any should fall in
love with that profession, whose professours were so miserable!
But truth hath alwayes a good face, though often but bad
clothes.</p>
                  <p>They were called by sundry names: Sometimes from the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where they lived: As from Albigeois, Tholouse, Lyons, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardy,
Bohemia; Albingenses, Tholousians, Lyonists, Picards,
Bohemians. Sometimes from their principall pastour: As from
Waldo, Joseph, Henry, Esperon, Arnold; Waldenses, Jofe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phists,
Henricians, Esperonites, Arnoldists. In England they
were termed Lolards, from<note n="*" place="margin">Io. Paul. Perin. Hist. Waldens. l. 1. c. 3.</note> Lolard their teacher; not as some
Friar descanteth, <hi>quasi Lolium in area Domini.</hi> It appeareth not
whether they were thus called of others, or called themselves.
But grant the latter: and if any object, That they seemed
ashamed of Christ theirfirst godfather, who gave them the name
of Christians, thus to denominate themselves from their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
I answer, It is the same the Papists do, calling themselves
Benedictines, Dominicans, Franciscans, &amp;c. from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of their Orders.</p>
                  <p>They had also nick names; called, First, Poor men of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
not because they chose to be poor, but could not choose
but be poor, being stripped out of all their goods: And why
should the Friars glory be this peoples shame? they mocking at
poverty in others, which they count meritorious in themselves.
Secondly, Patarenians; that is, Sufferers, whose backs were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
for others to beat on. Thirdly, Turlupins; that is, Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
with wolves, (and yet might they be Gods sheep) being
forced to flee into woods. Fourthly, likewise they were called
Sicars; that is, Cut-purses. Fifthly, <hi>Fraterculi;</hi> that is, Shifters.
Sixthly, <hi>Insabbatae;</hi> that is, Observers of no Sabbath. Seventh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Pasagenes; that is, Wanderers. As also Arians, Manicheans,
Adamites (how justly will appear afterwards.) Yea, scarce was
there an arrow in all the quiver of malice which was not shot at
them.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>COme we now to the full and foul indictment wherewith
these Albingenses are charged: That they gave no reverence
to<note n="*" place="margin">Reinerius, fol. 22. art. 32.</note> holy places; rejected the baptisme of infants; held that
temporall power was grounded in grace; that it was a meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
work to persecute the Priests of Rome and their subjects:
with the Adamites they went naked (an affront to nature;)
with the Manicheans they made two first causes, God of good,
the devil of evil; held community of all things, even of wives
amongst them; were<note n="*" place="margin">Claudius Rubis, History of Lyons, pag. 269.</note> sorcerers and conjurers; (pretending to
command the devil, when they most obeyed him) guilty of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest,
buggery, and more unnaturall sins, whereby men (as it were)
run backward to hell.</p>
                  <p>No whit affrighted with this terrible accusation, many late
writers dare by their advocates to defend them, though confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them guilty of some of these, but not in so high and hainous
a manner as they are accused.</p>
                  <p>True it is, because most of that age ranne riot in adoring of
Churches, (as if some inherent sanctity was seeled to their roof,
or plaistered to their walls; yea, such as might more ingratiate
with God the persons and prayers of people there assembled)
the Waldenfes (out of that old errour not yet worn out, That
the best way to straighten what is crooked, is to over-bow it)
denied Churches that relative holinesse and fit reverence due
unto them. Baptisme of infants they refused not (though<note n="*" place="margin">In his 66. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Bernard, taking it rather from the rebound then first rise, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth

by one of their own Ministers; their tender consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
not digesting the Popish baptisme, where clear water by
Gods ordinance, was by mans additions made a salve or plaister.
That dominion was founded in grace, seemeth to be their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
opinion: Yea, it hangeth as yet in the Schools on the file, and
is not taken off, as a thing disputable, finding many favourers.
But grant it a great errour (for wicked men shall be arraigned
before God, not as usurpers, but as tyrants; not for not having
right, but not right using the creatures) yet herein they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not so far as the Papists now-a-dayes, to unthrone and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
excommunicated Princes: So that they who do most,
have least cause to accuse them. That they spoke too homely
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:94789:82"/>
and coursely of the Romish Priests, inveighing too bitterly and
uncharitably against them, condemning all for some, may per
chance be proved: And no wonder if they speak ill of those from
whom they felt ill. But take their speeches herein, as the words
of men upon the rack, forced from them by the extremity of
cruel usage.</p>
                  <p>In these errours the Albingenses hope to find favour, if men
consider, First, the ignorance of the age they lived in: It is no
news to stumble in the dark. Secondly, the frailty (that squire
of the body) attending on mans nature; yea, he shall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
who liveth till he be stoned by one without fault.
Thirdly, the errours themselves, which are rather in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limbs
then vitalls of religion. And it may be conceived they
might have been reclaimed, if used with gentle means, not cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chised
with fire and fagot; it being a true rule, That mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
are more moved with leading then dragging or
drawing.</p>
                  <p>But the sting of the indictment is still behind in the tail or
end thereof; charging them with such hainous errours in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and vices in life: All which the patrones for the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants<note n="*" place="margin">

deny and defie, as coined out of the mint of their enemies
malice.</p>
                  <p>It will be objected, If denying the fact might serve the turn,
we should have no male factours: This therefore is but a poore
plea, barely to deny, when that such clouds of witnesses are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them. And grant they have a few stragling writers, or
some sleeping records which may seem to acquit them, what
are one or two men (though suppose them giants) against a
whole army?</p>
                  <p>To this I find it answered for the Albingenses, That it hath
been the constant practice of the Romish writers, alwayes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame
those that differ from them, especially if they handle too
roughly the <hi>Noli me tangere</hi> of the Popes supremacy. In later

no wonder if they take liberty falsely to accuse the Albingenses,
conceiving themselves out of the reach of confutation, writing
in such an age when all the Counsel is on their own side, being
plaintiffs, and none assigned for the defendants.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I find they produce the authenticall copies (such
as are above their enemies calumnies) of the Catechismes, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies,
Remonstrances of these Albingenses; wherein the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled
doctrine of the Protestants is delivered free from
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:94789:83"/>
Manicheisme, or any other heresie fathered upon them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, their enemies slanders plainly appear in some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars;
which justly shaketh the credit of the whole accusation.
For whereas they are charged with the Adamites willingly to
haue gone naked, we find them rather <hi>nudati</hi> then <hi>nudi,</hi> forced
thereunto by the Popes Legate: Who being about to take the
city of Carcassone in France, where these people most swarmed,
he would not grant them their lives but on this condition,

who could feed his eies with contentment on such a sight, which
otherwise would more deeply have wounded the modesty of

now how justly these innocents are charged! As well may the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
be blamed for cruelty to themselves, in putting out their
own eies, when they were commanded to do it by the merciless
Ammonite.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, they are cleared by the testimonies of their very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
and who knoweth not, but such a witnesse is equivalent
to a generall consent? For those, who, when bemadded with
anger, most rave and rage against them, yet <hi>per lucida intervalla,</hi>
in their cold bloud, when their words are indicted from their
judgements not passions, do most sufficiently acquit them from
these accusations.</p>

                  <p>King Lewis the twelfth of France being throughly informed

raw pelts clapped about them for their clothes, the foure fect
whereof served instead of buttons; all equall in poverty, having
no beggars amongst them; their diet on deer and milk: yet was
there scarce any amongst them but could read and write hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely,
understand the Bible, and sing psalms; scarce a boy, but
could presently or by heart give an account of his faith: Tribute
they payed very religiously, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>But we must not forget how just before the warre began, the
Pope pretending to reclaim them by reasons to the Church of
Rome: To which end he gave order for a disputation with
them. The parties, place, and time were agreed on; who, where,
when they should dispute: but <hi>in fine</hi> nothing was effected. Yea,
who ever knew conferences in so great oppositions to ripen
kindly, and bring any fruit to perfection? For many come rather
for faction then satisfaction, resolving to carry home the same
opinions they brought with them: An upright moderatour will
scarce be found, who bangeth not to one side: The place will be
subject to suspicion, and hinder liberty: Boldnesse and readinesse
of speech with most (though not most judicious) auditours, will
bear away the bell from solidity of arguments: The passages in
the disputing will pe partially reported, and both sides will brag
of the conquest; so that the rent will be made worse, and more

without danger of choking. As for the city of Carcassone which
was not far from the burrough; to the inhabitants thereof those
immodest conditions were propounded, whereof formerly:
which they refused; and God better provided for them: For

a vault under ground, and so shifted abroad for themselves.</p>

now it was concluded that a secular captain should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
to him, in whose person the chief command should reside
over Martiall affairs; and for his pains, by the Popes donation,
he was to enjoy all countreys that should be conquered from the
Albingenses or their favourers. The place was offered to the
Duke of Burgundy, who refused it, saying, He had lands and
Lordships enow of his own, without spoiling others of their
goods. It was waved also by the Earls of St. Paul, and Nevers,
whether out of conscience or policie;<note place="margin">1210</note> because though the Pope
gave them the bears skin, they must first kill and flay him them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
At last Simon of Montfort, nigh Paris, accepted of it,
swearing to vex the Lords enemies. And for a breakfast to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with, he was seised of the Vicecounty of Besiers, proceeding
from hence to take many castles and cities.</p>
                  <p>One grand inconvenience attended on this army of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes:
For when their quarantine, or fourty dayes service,
was expited, (the term the Pope set them to merit Paradise in)
they would not stay one whit longer: Like post-horses they
would runne to their set stage, but could not be spurred one
foot further; contenting themselves they had already purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
heaven, and fearing they should be put in possession thereof
too soon, by losing their lives in that service. And though the
Bishops perswaded some few to stay, that so the surplusage of
their merits might make up the arterages of their friends which
wanted them, yet could they not prevail to any purpose. Nor
could they so cast and contrive their matters, the tide of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
devotion being uncertain, but that betwixt the going out
of the old and coming in of the new store of Pilgrimes, there
would be a low ebbe, wherein their army was almost wasted
to nothing: whereof the Albingenses made no small advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                  <p>However, the Earls of Tholouse, Foix, and Comminge, and
Prince of Berne, the patrones of the Albingenses, finding
they were too weak for this Holy army, sheltered themselves
under Peter King of Aragon; whose homagers they were, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving

investiture from him, though their dominions lay on
this side of the Pyrenean hills. This King had the greatnesse of
the Earl of Montfort in suspicion; fearing lest these severall
Principalities, which now were single arrows, should be bound
in one sheaf, conquered and united under Earl Simon. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he fomented a faction in them against the Holy armie;
publickly protesting against the proceedings of Earl Simon;
charging him to have turned the bark of Gods Church into a
pirates ship, robbing others and inriching themselves under
the pretence of Religion, seizing on the lands of good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
for supposed hereticks, using Gods cause as hunters
do a stand, in it the more covertly to shoot at what game they
please: Otherwise, why was the Vicecount of Beziers, who
lived and died firm in the Romish faith, lately trained into the
Legates hand, and against oaths and promises of his safe return,
kept close prisoner till his death, and his lands seized on by Earl
Simon?</p>
                  <p>At last the King of Aragon taking the Earl of Montfort on
the advantage (shooting him as it were betwixt wind and water,
the ending of the old and beginning of new Pilgrimes) forced
him to a battel. The King had thirty thousand foot and seven
thousand horse; but the Earl, of both foot and horse not above
two thousand two hundred. They closed together near the
castle of Moret: And the King, whether out of zeal of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
and thirst of honour, or distrust of under officers, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to animate others, or a mixture of all, ranne his curver so
openly, and made his turns and returns in the head of the army,
that so fair a mark invited his enemies arrows to hit him; by
whom he was wounded to death, and fell from his horse: to
lesson all Generals to keep themselves, like the heart, in the body
of the army, whence they may have a virtuall omnipresence in
every part thereof; and not to expose their persons (which, like
crystall vials, contain the extracted spirits of their souldiers
spilled with their breaking) to places of imminent danger. With
his body fell the hearts of his men:<note place="margin">1212</note> And though the Earls of
Tholouse, Foix, and Comminge, perswaded, entreated, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them to stay, they used their oratorie so long till their
audience ran all away, and they were fain to follow them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
themselves by flight to redeem their honour some
other time.</p>
                  <p>Simon improving this victory, pursued them to the gates of
Tholouse, and killed many thousands. The Friars imputed
this victory to the Bishops benediction, and adoring a piece
of the Crosse, together with the fervency of the Clergies
prayers, which remaining behind in the castle of Moret, batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
heaven with their importunity. On the other side, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingenses
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:94789:86"/>
acknowledged Gods justice in punishing the proud
King of Aragon; who, as if his arm had been strong and long

cast himself down at his feet then to fight. But such reckonings
without the host are ever subject to a rere-account.</p>
                  <p>Yet within few years the face of this warre began to alter:
(With writers of short-hand we must set a prick for a letter, a
letter for a word, marking onely the most remarkables.) For
young Reimund Earl of Tholouse, exceeding his father in valour
and successe, so bestirred himself, that in few moneths he regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what Earl Simon was many years in getting: And at last Earl
Simon besieging Tholouse,<note place="margin">1118</note> with a stone which a woman let flie

                  <p>Men use not to be niggards of their censures on strange acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents:
Some paralleled his life with Abimelech that tyrant-Judge;
who with the bramble (fitter to make a fire then a King
of) accepted of the wooden Monarchie, when the vine, olive,
figge-tree declined it. They paired them also in their ends, death
disdaining to send his summons by a masculine hand, but arresting
them both by a woman. Some perswaded themselves they saw
Gods finger in the womans hand; that because the greater part
of his cruelty lighted on the weaker sex, (for he had buried the
Lady of la Vaur alive, respecting neither her sex nos nobility) a
woman was chosen out to be his executioner: though of himself
he was not so prone to cruelty, but had those at his elbow which
prompted him to it. The time of his death was a large field for
the conceits of others to walk in; because even then when the
Pope and three Councils, of Vaur, Montpelier, and Laterane,

the Pope resolved of a privater way, which made lesse noise

way to draw them low, was to stop them in the fountain. It
was also most honour to rouze the Lion in his own denne. And
Palestine was so forraged, that there was nothing to be gleaned
in the stubble; whereas Egypt was so rich and fruitfull, it cared
not for the frowns of heaven, so it might have the favour of
Nilus; and there was no fear to want bread in that the granary
of the world. That, according to the rule, <hi>Plus animi est infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renti
periculum, quam propulsanti;</hi> the Christians would be
heartned, but the Egyptians discouraged in the invasion of
Egypt. The sad spectacle of their countreys vastation would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
their minds, make them diffident of their own worth, and
unsufficient to maintain their cause. Lastly, the Christians might
leave when they list, reserving at all times Ptolemais to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them, in case fortune should crosse their designes.</p>
                  <p>But the reasons to the contrary wanted not weight but
weighing. They considered not (what was objected) That to
invade a strong entire countrey without having a partie within
it to side with them, was to endeavour to cleave a tree with a
beetle without a wedge. Besides, Egypt was an exception from
the rules of all other countreys, and had certain locall maximes
of leading of an army appropriated to it alone. That Valour must
needs have the fall, when it wrastleth with Nature it self, and
fighteth against bogs, rivers, and inundations. That it was more
agreeable to reason, first to recover and defend what once was
their own, before they attempted other mens possessions. That
these their forces afforded little hope of victory in another King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which were not able to clear their own countrey, and the
forts in Syria, from so dangerous an enemy. Lastly, That the
Egyptians fighting for their fathers, wives, and children, would
raise their valour to the highest point of resolution. These argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
notwithstanding, the watch-word was given for Egypt;
whither all addressed themselves.</p>
                  <p>And here began the discords betwixt King John and the
Popes Legate, who challenged not onely an influence but a
predominancy in every thing, and would dictate to the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what he should do in martiall affairs: He presumed on his
book-learning to controll the practice of experienced Captains
by his military speculations. The King stormed hereat, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there were some mysteries in the Captain-craft not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
to any which had not served the trade, and which
the heart of a Scholar was too narrow to contain; That though
Scholarship was a stock fit to graff any profession on, yet some
good time is requisite thereunto; and that they must not think to
proceed military Masters at their first admission in a camp; That
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:94789:89"/>
though the Legate might conceive himself to know the Latitude
of warlike principles, yet he knew not the use of distinctions,
exceptions, and cautions of application; and might easily be
misled by disproportion and dissimilitude of examples, the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of circumstances, the infinitenesse of punctuall occurrences:
Wherefore he forbad him to meddle with martiall matters,
challenging them to belong to his own disposall. But Pelagius
the Legate highly opinioned of his own sufficiencie, as if his
place made him infallible in every thing, and loth to confesse
himself besides the cushion whilest he sat in the chair, would
have an oar in all actions. He held this conclusion, That the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall

of them <hi>pro exigentia hic &amp; nunc,</hi> herein reason was the
key of the work, which scholars having most perfected by learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
were thereby the most competent judges what should be

this his errour, and how this discord, smothered for a while,
brake out, we shall see hereafter. Mean time, hoising up sails,
the Pilgrimes navie safely arrived at Damiata.</p>

difficulty, besides Damiata it self:</p>

the Legate; whereby the water soon abated. And lest Gods

thanksgiving was proclaimed, that this favour obtained by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
might be kept by praises.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they were to grapple with the fort of Pharia, a
seeming-impregnable place, betwixt them and Damiata. To
check this fort, the Christians built a towre on ships: which sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
falling, brained many, bruised more of their own men;
and all who felt not the blow, were stricken with the fright.
King John comforted his souldiers discouraged hereat, desiring
them to apprehend actions by their true causes; and as not to
vaunt of blind victories, so not to be dismaied at casuall mishaps,
so purely accidentall, that there was no guard against them in the
schools of defence,<note place="margin">Aug. 24.</note> either of wisdome or valour. By his advice
a more substantiall towre was built, the rarest piece in that kind
the world ever saw; by the manning whereof, after many blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
assaults, they mastered the fort of Pharia.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they had to do with Meladine King of Egypt, who
lay besides them, constantly furnishing the citie with men and
victuals, and exercising the Christians with continual skirmishes.
In one,<note place="margin">1219 Febr.</note> with his wild-fire he did them much harm, and King
John was dangerously scorched. But seeing that the Christians
hewed their way through the rocks of all difficulties, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
peace unto them by the mediation of Noradine his
brother, King of Damascus; profering them, if they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
to restore them the true Crosse, the citie of Jerusalem, and
all the land of Palestine.</p>

strong barred chests, the merchants of Egypt and India had
locked up their treasure. A full yeare the Christians stayed
here, contented to make this Inne their home. Here arose new
discords betwixt the King and the new Legate, who by virtue
of his Legation challenged Damiata for his Holinesse, which
by publik agreement was formerly assigned to the King. Bren
in anger returned to Ptolemais, both to puff out his discontents
in private, and to teach the Christians his worth by wanting him:
For presently they found themselves at a losse; neither could
they stand still without disgrace, nor go on without danger.
The Legate commanded them to march up; but they had too
much spirit to be ruled by a Spirituall man, and swore not to
stir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e a step except the King was with them. Messengers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were sent to Ptolemais to fetch him. They found him of
a steelie nature; once through hot, long in cooling: yet by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
him he should have his own desires, they over-perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him not to strave an armie by feeding his own humours.</p>

                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:94789:90"/>Scarce after eight moneths absence was he returned to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miata,
but new divisions were betwixt them: the Legate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
the armie to march up and besiege Cairo; he promised,
if they would obey him, they should quickly command all Egypt,
by present invading it. Let defenders lie at a close game, and
offer no play. Delayes are a safe shield to save, but celerity the
best I word to winne a countrey. Thus Alexander conquered
the world before it could bethink it self to make resistance. And
thus God now opened them a doore of victorie, except they
would barre it up with their own idlenesse.</p>
                  <p>But the King advised to return into Syria; That Cairo was
difficult to take, and impossible to keep; That the ground
whereon they went, was as treacherous as the people against
whom they fought; That better now to retire with honour,
then hereafter flie with shame; That none but an empirick in
warre will deny, but that more true valour is in an orderly well

                  <p>But the Legate used an inartificiall argument drawn from the
authority of his place, thundering excommunication against
those that would not march forward: And now needs must they
go when he driveth them.</p>
                  <p>The crafty Egyptians (of whom it is true, what is said of the
Parthians, Their flight is more to be feared then their fight) ran
away, counterfeiting cowardlinesse. The Christians triumphed

                     <p>The miserable case of the drowned Christians in
Egypt. Damiata surrendred in ransome of
their lives.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>EGypt is a low level countrey, except some few advantages
which the Egyptians had fortified for themselves. Through
the midst of the land ran the river Nilus; whose stream they
had so bridled with banks and sluces, that they could keep it to
be their own servant, and make it their enemies master at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
The Christians confidently marched on; and the Turks
perceiving the game was come within the toil, pierced their
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:94789:91"/>
banks, and unmuzzling the river, let it runne open mouth upon
them; yet so, that at first they drowned them up but to the
middle, reserving their lives for a further purpose, thereby in
exchange to recover Damiata and their countreys liberty.</p>
                  <p>See here the land of Egypt turned in an instant into the Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian
sea! See an army of sixty thousand, as the neck of one man,
stretched on the block, and waiting the fatall stroke! Many cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Legate, and their own rashnesse, that they should follow
the counsel of a gowned man (all whose experience was clasped
in a book) rather then the advice of experienced captains. But
too late repentance, because it soweth not in season, reapeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but unavoidable miserie.</p>
                  <p>Meladine King of Egypt seeing the constancy and patience of
the Christians, was moved with compassion towards them.
He had of himself strong inclinations to Christianity, wearie of
Mahometanisme, and willing to break that prison, but for
watchfull jaylers about him. He proferred the Christians their
lives on condition they would quit the countrey and restore Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miata.
They accepted the conditions, and sent messengers to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miata
to prepare them for the surrendring of it. But they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the citie, being themselves safe on shore, tyrannized on their
poore brethren in shipwrack; pretending, That this armie of
Pilgrimes deserved no pity, who had invited this misfortune on
themselves by their own rashnesse; That if they yielded up this
citie for nothing, which cost so many lives, they should betray
themselves to the derision of the whole world; That if these
perished, more men might be had, but no more Damiata's; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a place of such importance, it would alwayes be a snaffle in
the mouth of the Egyptian King. On the other side, the friends
of the distressed Christians confessed, That indeed their voyage
was unadvised and justly to be blamed; yet worse and more
inconsiderate projects have armies oft undertaken, which, if
crowned with successe, have been above censure, yea, have
passed not onely without questioning but with commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
But this is the misery of misery, that those who are most
afflicted of God, shall be most condemned of men. Wherefore
they requested them to pity their brethren, and not to leave
them in this forlorn estate. How clamorous would their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
bloud be in the court of Heaven, to sue for revenge on
those who forsook them in this distresse! And grant Damiata
a citie of great consequence; yet cities in themselves were but
dead things, and men were the souls to enliven them: so that
those souldiers which wonne Damiata, if preserved alive, might
haply recover as strong a citie afterwards.</p>
                  <p>But finding their arguments not to prevail, they betook
themselves to arms, by force to compell the adverse party to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:94789:91"/>
resigne the citie. King John also threatned, in case they denied
to surrender it, to give up to Meladine Ptolemais in Syria in
exchange for Damiata. At last, according to the agreement,
Damiata was restored to the Turks, and the Christian army let
out of the trap wherein it was taken. Meladine out of his prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the greatest blow given them without a blow given them; the

years. And now matters being settled as well as they
might be in Syria, King John took a journey to Rome; where
he was bountifully feasted, and honourably entertained by the

so that he was father in law both to Emperour of East and West.</p>
                  <p>Some condemned his resignation as an unadvised act; as if
he had first parted from his wits, who would willingly part
from a Kingdome; whilest others commend his discretion: For
first, his wife was dead, in whose right he held his Kingdome,
and thereby a door was opened for other litigious pretenders
to the Crown. Secondly, it was policie, <hi>fugere ne fugaretur;</hi> yea,
this was no flight, but an honourable departure. Well he knew
the Turks power to invade, and his own weaknesse to defend
what was left in Syria: So that finding the weight too heavy
for himself, he did well to lay it on stronger shoulders. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
before his resignation he had little more then a title: and
after it he had nothing lesse; men having so tuned their tongues
to salute him King of Jerusalem, that he was so called to the
day of his death. Lastly, what he wanted in the statelinesse of
his bed, he had in the soundnesse of his sleep; and though his

this stone rolled, the more mosse he gathered. In France, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides

much bred in him as he brought to it: Treasons against him
were so frequent, he could not be safe but he must be severe, nor

                  <p>IT is verily conceived that the Pope provided this match
for Frederick to imploy him in Palestine, whilest he at home
might play his game at pleasure. For as provident Nature in
marshalling the elements, assigned fire a place in the verge and
border of this lower world farre from the rest, lest otherwise
the activity thereof might set the others in combustion: so the
Pope disposed this hot violent-spirited Emperour farre off, and
engaged him in a distant and dangerous warre out of the borders
of Europe.</p>
                  <p>Frederick smelt the project of his Holinesse, being also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

of his promise and his voyage into Palestine from
moneth to moneth, and yeare to yeare, wisely gaining time by
losing.</p>
                  <p>The truth was, he was not yet ripe for such an expedition.</p>
                  <p>The Pope was afraid of his valour, he of the Popes treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and more feared him behind his back then the Turk before
his face. He was loth to let go the Eagle he had in hand, to
catch the little bird that was in the bush. Wherefore as yet he
refused to go, pleading that the eight years truce, which King
Bren had made with the Turks, was not yet expired; before
which time to fight against them, was to fight against God and
conscience: and that it was no way to propagate the Faith by
breach of faith.</p>
                  <p>Pope Honorius continued still to put him in mind of his

the ninth succeeded him; who at the first dash excommunicated
the Emperour for his delay.</p>
                  <p>Know by the way, that his name-sake Gregory the seventh
(otherwise Hildebrand) first handselled his excommunication
on Henry the fourth. Before his time the Imperiall majesty
(what is observed of the Seal, that it is never hit with thunder)
was never fulminated against with excommunication: afterward
nothing more usuall; till the commonnesse of those thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts
caused their contempt, and the Emperours natures were so
used to this physick it would not work with them. Of late his
Holinesse is grown more advised, very sparingly using them,
especially against Protestant Princes; counting it policie to
hold that weapon within the scabbard, which hath no other
edge but what is given it by the opinion of those against whom
it is used.</p>
                  <p>Frederick at last cometh forth of Germany with his army,

which stayed his journey many moneths.</p>
                  <p>It went near to the Pope, that the Emperour was so near
to him: His case now was worse then formerly. For he had
rouzed the Lion out of his denne, but could not get him into
the net. His sicknesse must either be more or lesse to do good.
And the Pope having no variety of weapons, excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him afresh, pretending Fredericks disease was onely the
cramp of lazinesse, and that he was sick to do good, but sound
to do mischief; as appeared by his unjust seizing on the

departed, bearing up with his navy for Palestine. The Pope
hearing thereof, be-libelled him more fouly then ever before,
because like an undutifull sonne he departed without his Fathers
blessing, being not absolved and reconciled to his Mother the
Church.</p>

                  <p>SEe how Gods blessing goeth along with the Popes curses!
The fame of Fredericks valour and maiden fortune, never as
yet spotted with ill successe, like an harbinger hastening before,
had provided victorie to entertain him at his arrival; yea, this
Emperour, swifter then Cesar himself, overcame before he came
over into Palestine.</p>
                  <p>At this time the state of the Turks in Syria was very aguish,
and Fredericks coming put them into a shaking fit.<note n="*" place="margin">Centuriat.</note> Coradine
was dead, his children in minority, the Turkish Souldans facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
boiling in enmity one against another. Whereupon the
Sultan of Babylon, who was of chiefest authority, and governed
Syria, profered Frederick so honourable conditions as he might
desire, but could never hope for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely, To restore unto him
Jerusalem and all Palestine, in as full and ample a manner as it
was possessed by Baldwine the fourth, before Saladine subdued
it; To set all Christian captives at liberty; provided, that the
Turks might have accesse to the Sepulchre, (though not lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
in the citie but suburbs, and that in small numbers at a time)
there to do their devotions, they also having a knowledge of,
and giving an honour to Christ, though no better then ignorance
and dishonour of him.</p>
                  <p>Frederick before he ratified any thing by oath, sent to have
the Popes approbation:<note n="*" place="margin">Centuriat.</note> who ill intreated and imprisoned his
messengers, denied them audience, and contemptuously tore
the Emperours letters. Wherefore Frederick without, yea, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Holinesse consent, concluded a ten years truce with
the Sultan; and on<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. in anno 1229. pag. 480.</note> Easter-day triumphantly entring Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
crowned himself King with his own hands.<note place="margin">1229</note> For Gerard
Patriarch of Jerusalem, and Oliver master of the Templars,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:94789:94"/>
with all the Clergie, absented themselves; neither was there
any<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. in anno 1229. pag. 479.</note> masse sung in the citie as long as the Emperour being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
remained there.</p>
                  <p>See that produced as it were in an instant which the succession
of many years could not perform, all the Holy land recovered!
Some gallants perchance (whose curious palates count all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
drie meat which are not juiced with bloud) will dispraise
this Emperours victory for the best praise thereof, because it
was so easily gotten without drawing his sword for it. But they
deserve to go naked who scorn to wear good clothes if they cost
not dear.</p>
                  <p>The Templars were vexed at heart that they had no partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in the glory of this action; yea, this touched their copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold:
Had they lived lazie thus long in Palestine, sucking the
<note n="*" place="margin">Idem, ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</note> sweet of Christendome to no purpose? See, Frederick with
few men, little money, lesse time, as master of his craft, had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
that which these bunglers had so long in vain been fum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
about!</p>
                  <p>Wherefore they wanting true merit to raise themselves to the
pitch of Fredericks honour, sought by false detraction to depresse
him to the depth of their own basenesse; defaming him, as if he
conspired with the Sultan to the ruine of all Christianity. In the
mean time the Christians every where built and repaired the
cities of Palestine, being now resigned into their hands. Joppa
and Nazareth they strongly fortified: the walls of Jerusalem
were repaired, the Churches therein adorned, and all publick
edifices either wholly cast their skin with the snake, or at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
renewed their bill with the eagle, having their fronts either
built or beautified. But new tackling to an old rotten keel will
never make serviceable ship. Short were the smiles of this citie,
which groning under Gods old curse, little joyed her self in this
her new bravery.</p>

But the Pope knew he should catch no fish if
the waters were thus clear:<note place="margin">1229</note> Wherefore he
stirred up John Bren, Fredericks father in
law (guesse whether his plots ran not low
when he used such dregs) to raise a rebellion
in Italy against him.</p>
                  <p>His Holinesse spread a false report of purpose, that Frederick
was dead. Who would think there were so much substance in a
shadow! This vain rumour wrought reall effects, strengthening
Fredericks foes with hopes, and staggering his friends with fear
and uncertainties. Bren striking the iron whilest it was hot,
wonne many places from the Emperour: And though Time
soon after was delivered of her daughter Truth, yet the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
came too late, to shut the door when the steed was
stoln; the Pope having attained his ends, and served his turn
already.</p>
                  <p>A jubile of liberty was proclaimed to all the Emperours sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and they dispensed with from the Pope for their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
to him. Milan, and many other cities in Italy, formerly
Imperiall, danced at this musick, made a foot-cloth of their
Masters livery, and from this time dated themselves Free-States.
Here was brave gleaning, where all ranne away with whole
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:94789:95"/>
sheaves; where robbery was priviledged for lawfull purchase.
And the Pope, wise enough not so to give away the pie but
to keep the best corner for himself, carved all Apulia for his
own part.</p>
                  <p>Whilest hostility in Italy, treason beset Frederick in Syria;
the Templars intimated to the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wash himself in Jordan, that so he might be surprized. But the
Sultan (no doubt out of pity to see a Lion catched in a Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap,
there being a consangumity of all Princes, and the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
bloud which runneth in their veins causing a sympathie of

and sent their letters to Frederick: Who afterwards u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Templars, and generally all the Clergie in Palestine
(counting them complices with the Pope) coursely, not to say
cruelly.</p>
                  <p>At last having confirmed his ten years truce, and having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Reinoldus Duke of Bavaria his Lieutenant in Syria,
without noise he cometh into Europe. For to return triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

for his enemies to prepare against him. He outsailed fame
it self, landing in Italy in person before he arrived there in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
Then the love of his loyall subjects, hitherto rather co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted

                  <p>Within fifteen dayes, assisted with the Duke of Spoletum,
Frederick recovered all which was wonne from him, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravelled

                  <p>Then was all Italy (resembled by Geographers, for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion

affecting the owl, a bird which other nations scorn and hate, as
the usher of ill luck. The occasion was this: A King of Tartary

place: Whereupon they desisted from further search, conceiving
that that anchorite bird proclaimed nothing was there but soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and desolation. Hence in gratitude they never count them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
more gay then when their helmets are hung with owls

The King of these Tartarians styleth himself, The great
Cham, and is monarch of a great part of the world in possession,
of the rest in imagination. He taketh and his subjects give him

swarming with more bees then hives, sent their superfluous
numbers to seek their fortunes amongst the Christians. They
needed no steel armour who had iron bodies. Onely with
bows, cruelty, and multitude they overranne Lituania, Podolia,
Polonia, and those countreys which are the East-boundaries of
Europe. Others took their way Southward into Asia, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
outrages as they went; and sensible how incomparably their
own countrey was surpassed for pleasure and profit by these new
lands, (blame not their judgement if they preferred a palace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a prison) they little cared to return home.</p>
                  <p>Their incursions into Europe were so farre and frequent, that
Pope Innocent the fourth, about the yeare 1245, began to fear
them in Italy. Wherefore he sent Askelin, a Friar much admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

nation to Christianity. Where Askelin, instead of teaching them
the elements of our religion, laid this foundation, to amplifie to

to the great advantage of the Turks and prejudice of the Holy

by the goodnesse of the way.</p>
                  <p>Anciently in the primitive time the Church of Rome was
esteemed the first and chiefest of all others, but without any ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
above them. Because that was the Imperiall citie and
Queen of the world, therefore the Church therein was highest in
account; as the candle which is in the fairest candlestick is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
set above the rest (though otherwise equall unto it in
light) at the upper end of the table.</p>
                  <p>It happened afterward that the Emperour removed his seat
from Rome to Constantinople; Whereupon orphane Rome
suddenly decayed (for the Emperours court carried day with it,
and left night behind it) was chief mourner at the funeralls of
her own greatnesse; and from a pleasant garden turned a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse
overgrown with Goths, Vandals, and other barbarous
weeds: whilest Constantinople tricked and tired her self, started
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:94789:98"/>
up in an instant great, rich, and stately; insomuch that John her
Patriarch claimed to be universall Bishop above all other. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
the Great, Bishop of Rome, stoutly withstood him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing
that he was the usher of Antichrist who assumed that
swelling title; wherein he heated the brand to mark his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour
with: For Boniface (save one, the next) Pope of Rome
so dealt with Phocas the Emperour of Constantinople, that he
got himself confirmed universall Bishop over the whole world.
A Chaplain and a Patrone well met, both usurpers, supporting
one another (like stones in an arch) with their reciprocall aid;
Phocas held Boniface in his chair, and Boniface kept Phocas in
his throne. And thus was the Pope of Rome first possessed of
his Primacie both of dignity and authority, both of precedencie
and of power and jurisdiction over all other Churches. As for
his pretence, to challenge it by commission from Christ and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
from Peter, this string to his bow is so full of gauls, frets,
and knots, it cannot hold, and is broken by many learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.</p>
                  <p>However, Constantinople rather overborn then overcome,
for want rather of strength then stomach, ever rebelled, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
resisted (for no rebellion against usurpation) Romes supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
(especially when she found her self befriended with any
advantage) for many hundred years after.</p>
                  <p>It happened (to come to the matter in hand) that a Grecian
<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. in anno 1237. pag. 622.</note> Archbishop went to Rome, there to have his confirmation.
Where the Court demanded of him such unreasonable fees
(toll more then the grist) that the Prelate perceived it would
weaken him to be confirmed, and shake his estate to settle him
in his Bishoprick. Home therefore he cometh with a loud
alarm against the extortions of Rome, and mustereth together
many of his countrey-men; who hereupon for ever withdrew
their obedience from Rome, and threw off that heavy yoke
they could not bear, hereafter owning her for their sister not
mother.</p>
                  <p>It may seem strange that the Romane Court being here just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taxed for extortion, would not amend it. But how often so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
she be told of her dirty face, she will never wash it: For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
would argue a former fault; and they feared, if they
yielded themselves guilty in one point, it would shake the
whole fabrick of their credit. Besides, if the Grecians had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
satisfaction and redresse in this grievance, it would have
given them pretence to prepare more requests, aed to think that
they also were due. Lastly, no strength of perswasion will
draw men from those sinnes which are glued unto them by
their profit. Thus the avarice of the Romish officers (as of late
the shamefull shamelesse covetousnesse of their Indulgence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:94789:99"/>
occasioned Luthers falling from them) caused the
Grecians wholly to renounce their subjection to that See: and

himself, without any dependencie on the Pope.</p>

                  <p>BEsides their rejecting of the Popes both Ecclesiasticall and
Temporall tyranny, the Greeks differ from the Latines in
other matters of moment: For they maintain the procession of
the holy Spirit from the Father alone. As for their other te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents,
they stand in some middle terms of opinion betwixt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
and Protestants; yet so, that they approch near the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
in more, to us in more weighty and dominative points.

Auricular Confession, in worshipping of Pictures (onely of Christ

they hold, but not in hell or the skirts thereof, nor by any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

Scriptures to salvation, in denying the Infallibility of the
Church, (much more of the Pope) the overplus of Merits, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
understood, Indulgences, Liberaties out of Purgatorie,
and the like.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon the Romanists condemn them all for hereticks and
castawayes, killing more then a third of all Christians (as Cain
did a quarter of mankind with a blow) with this their unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

censure. But heaven-gate was not so easily shut against
multitudes when S. Peter himself wore the keyes at his girdle.
And let us not with rash judging thrust all into the pit of hell
whom we see walking near the brink thereof. We shall think
better of them if we consider, That</p>
                  <p>First, their tenets wherein they dissent from the Romanists
are sound enough, save that of the holy Ghost. Concerning
which it is an usefull <hi>quaere,</hi> Whether, granting the first au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
and ringleaders of that errour in a bad condition, there
be not some favour to be allowed to those who in simplicity suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to hereditary errours received from their ancestours, if they
do not wilfully barre nor bolt their eyes against the beams of the
truth, but be willing (as we charitably conceive of the Greeks)
to receive and embrace better instruction.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Master of the Sentences (waited on herein with
other<note n="*" place="margin">Bonavent. 1. Sent. dist. 11. art. 1. quest. 1. Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, 1. Sent. dist. 1. quaest. 1. Th. Aquin. part. 1. quaest. 36. art. 2.</note> learned men) is of opinion, That in the sense of the
Greek Church <hi>A Filio</hi> and <hi>Per Filium</hi> is no reall difference, but
a question <hi>in modo loquendi.</hi> Sure it would have grated the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
if they had so denied the procession of the holy Ghost
from the Sonne, as thereby to make an inequality betwixt the
two Persons: But since their form of speech is, That the holy
Ghost proceedeth from the Father by the Sonne, and is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Sonne, without making any difference in the consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiality
of the Persons, their doctrine may passe with a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
interpretation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, our quickest sight in the matters of the Trinity is
but one degree above blindnesse. Wherefore, as concerning it,
let our piety lodge there where in other disputes the deceit of
sophisters used to nestle it self, namely, <hi>in universalibus,</hi> in large
and generall expressions, and not descend to curious particulars.

                  <p>Lastly, this their tenet doth not infect any other point in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
with its poysonous inferences. Some errours are worse in
their train then in themselves, which (as the Dragon in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation

their bad consequences pervert other points of religion: But
this Grecian opinion (as learned men propound it) concerning

                  <p>More may be alledged for the lessening of this errour: But

and Latine Church; What hope of reconcilement
betwixt them; The influence this breach had on
the Holy warre.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IF that religion were surely the best which is of the greatest
latitude and extent, Surveyers of land were fitter then Divines
to judge of the best religion. Neither is it any matter of great
moment to measure the greatnesse of either Church: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Rome maketh her Universality such a masterpiece to boast
of, let us see if the Greek Church may not outshoot her in her
own bow.</p>
                  <p>If we begin with the Grecian Church in Africa under the
Patriarch of Alexandria, thence proceeding into Asia, and fetch
a compasse about Syria, Armenia, Asia the lesse, with Cyprus,
Candie, and other Islands in the mid-land-sea, and so come into
Grecia; if hence we go into Russia and Muscovia (who though
differing in ceremonies, dissent not in doctrine; as a sundry dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
maketh not a severall language) to take onely entire King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and omit parcels: it is a larger quantity of ground then
that the Romish religion doth stretch to, since Luther cut so
large a collop out of it, and withdrew North-Europe from obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to his Holinesse.</p>
                  <p>Perchance the Romanists may plead they have lately impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the patrimony of their religion by new purchases in both
Indies: But who knoweth not that those people, rather watered
then baptized, affrighted with cruelty into Christianity, deserve
not to be accounted settled and well-grounded professours of
their religion?</p>
                  <p>As for reconciliation betwixt the Grecians and Latines, it is
utterly improbable, except the Greeks submit to the Popes Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie,
which they will never do. No hope then of their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together, when neither party will stirre step towards other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:94789:100"/>True it is, some fourty years since (<hi>anno</hi> 1594) the Bishops
of little Russia (a countrey following the Eastern Church, but
under the King of Poland) on condition they would accept the
Popes<note n="*" place="margin">Possevin. in Apparatu sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cro, Rutheni. See Brier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, chap. 18.</note> supremacie, were dispensed with, and permitted in other
matters to adhere to the Greek Church, and keep union with it;
the Pope manifesting herein, that he aimeth not so much at the
reduction of the Greeks to the truth, as to his own obedience.</p>
                  <p>Besides the hatred they have against the Popes pride, another
great hindrance of the union is the small intercourse the Eastern
Christians have or desire to have with the Western. They live
amongst the Turks, and are grown to be contented slaves; and
having long since parted with their hopes, now almost have lost
their desire of liberty.</p>
                  <p>We must not forget, how some fifty years ago solemn news
was reported in Rome, that the<note n="*" place="margin">Sr Edw. Sand. West. Relig. pag. 100.</note> Patriarch of Alexandria, with
all the Greek Church in Africa, by their Embassadours had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
and reconciled themselves to the Pope, and from him
received Absolution and Benediction: All which was a politick
lie, perchance therefore reported, that it might make impression
in the minds, and raise and confirm the spirits of the vulgar, who
easily believe all that their betters tell them. And though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
this report was controlled to be false, yet mens spirits
then being cold, were not so sensible of it as before: and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
news came to many mens ears who never heard afterwards
of the check and confutation thereof. Nor is there any State
in the world that maketh such use and advantage, as the Papall
doth, of false news. To conclude; As it is a maxime in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
<hi>Ex quibus constamus, ex iisdem nutrimur:</hi> so a great part of
their religion consisting of errours and falshoods, it is suitable
that accordingly it should be kept up and maintained with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries
and deceits.</p>
                  <p>To return to Palestine; This rent (not in the seam but whole
cloth) betwixt these Churches was no mean hindrance to the
Holy warre. Formerly the Greeks in Syria were not so clearly
cut asunder from the Latines, but that they hung together by one
great sinew in the common cause, agreeing against the Turk the
enemy to both: But since this last breach, the Greeks did in their
desires propend and incline to the Turks, being better contented
they should conquer, from whom they should have fair quarter,
free exercise of their religion, and secure dwelling in any citie,
paying a set tribute; then the Latines, who they feared would
force their consciences, and bring their souls in subjection to the
Popes supremacie. Expect we then never hereafter, that either
their hearts or hands should afford any assistance to our Pilgrimes
in their designes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Idem, pag. 242.</note> Some conceive, that at this day if the Western Christians
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94789:101"/>
should stoutly invade Turkie with any likelihood to prevail, the
Greeks therein would runne to aid them. But others are of a
contrary judgement; considering, First, the inveterate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid

the jealousie they have that they will never keep pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
with them, who have alwayes a warrant dormant from
the Pope to break all contracts prejudiciall to the Romish
Church: Thirdly, that custome and long continuance in slavery
have so hardened and brawned their shoulders, the yoke doth
not wring them so much: yea, they had rather suffer the Turks,
being old full flies, to suck them, then to hazard their galled
backs to new hungry ones; finding by experience, That they
themselves live on better terms of servitude under the Turk,
lesse grated and grinded with exactions, then some of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men
do under the Latines; for instance, in Zante and

to move at all, where there was more danger to hurt then hope
to help their present estate.</p>
                  <p>But though this peace was honourable and profitable, having
no fault but that Frederick made it; yet the Templars who did
not relish the father, must needs distast the child: They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
that this peace was not used as a slumber to refresh the
souldiers spirit, but as a lethargie to benumme their valour;
and chiefly snarled at this indignity, That the Turks had accesse
to the temple of the Sepulchre, and that Goats had free-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monage
in the Sheeps pasture. Wherefore Pope Gregory, to
<note n="*" place="margin">Iidem, ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</note> despite the Emperour Frederick, caused the Dominicans and
Franciscans his trumpeters, to incite people to the Holy warre.
These were two twin-orders, but the Dominican the eldest;
which now were no sooner hatched in the world, but presently
chirped in the pulpits. In that age Sermons were news, and
meat for Princes not common men: Yea, the Albingenses with
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:94789:101"/>
their preaching had drowned the voices of secular Priests, if these
two Orders had not helped to out-noise those supposed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.
These amplified with their rhetorick the calamity of the
Christians, tyrannie of the Turks, merit of the cause, probability
of successe; performing their parts with such gravity, shew of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
accents of passion, not glued on for the present purpose
but so naturall as from true affection, that many were wooed to
undertake the voyage:<note place="margin">1239</note> Principally, Theobald King of Navarre,
Almerick Earl of Montfort, Henry of Champaigne, Peter Earl
of Bretaigne, with many others of inferiour rank.</p>
                  <p>Ships they had none; wherefore they were fain to shape their
passage by land through Grecia: where they were entertained
with treachery, famine, and all the miseries which wait on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
armies. These came last that way, and (I may say) shut
the door: For no Christian army ever after went that tedious
journey by land.</p>
                  <p>Having passed the Bosporus, they marched into Bithynia:
thence through Galatia they came unto the mountain Taurus;
where they were much damnified by the Turks, who fell on and
off upon them, as they were advised by their own advantages.
The Christians desired no other gift but that a set battel might
be given them; which the Turks would not grant, but played at
distance and would never close. But with much ado the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
recovered to Antioch, having scarce a third part of them
left, their horses all dead, and themselves scarce mounted on
their legs, miserably weak; as what the mercy of sword, plague,
and famine had pleased to spare.</p>
                  <p>Hence the Templars conducted them to Gaza; where they
fell on forraging the countrey of the Sultan, assaulting no pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which were of strength, or honour to subdue, but onely
spoiled poore villages, which counted themselves walled with
the truce as yet in force. Abundance of wealth they got, and
were now late returning home, when after their plentifull sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

                     </gap>harp reckoning was called for: Behold, the Turks
in great numbers fell upon them near unto Gaza; and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
down with their bundles of spoil, and out with their
swords, bravely defending themselves till such time as the
night parted the fray. Here they committed a great errour, and
(as one may say) a neglect in over-diligence: for in stead of repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
themselves to rest, and appointing a set watch, they all lay
in a manner <hi>Perdues,</hi> no one slumbering all night, but attending
their enemies; contrary to the rules of an armie, which with
Argus should never have all its eyes wake or sleep together.
Next morning when the Turks, whose numbers were much in
creased, set upon them, alas! they being but few to many, faint
to fresh, were not able to make any forcible resistance: Yet,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:94789:102"/>
what they could not pay in present, they pawned their lives for;
that their arms being too weak for their hearts, they were rather
killed then conquered. Earl Henry was slain, Almerick taken
prisoner, the King of Navarre escaped by the swiftnesse of his
Spanish gennet; which race, for their winged speed, the Poets
feigned to be begot of the wind.</p>
                  <p>Mean time the other Christians looked on, and saw their
brethren slaughtered before their eyes; and yet though they
were able to help them, were not able to help them, their hands
being tied with the truce, and Reinoldus charging them no way
to infringe the peace concluded with the Sultan. Hereupon
many cursed him as the Christians cut-throat; he as fast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
the King of Navarre and his army for breaking the
truce. And though the Papall faction pleaded that the former
peace concluded not these late adventurers, and that it was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made with Frederick the Emperour; yet he representing the
whole body of Christianity, all the bundle of their shifts could
not piece out a satisfactory answer, but that they were guilty of
faith-breaking.</p>
                  <p>Home hastened the King of Navarre with a small retinue,
clouding himself in privatenesse; as that actour who cometh off
with the dislike of the spectatours, stealeth as invisibly as he
may into the tiring-house. Expectation, that friendly foe, did
him much wrong; and his performance fell the lower, because
men heightened their looking for great maters from him.</p>

No Christian should depart for want of pay; for he
would entertain any, and give them good wages that would do
work in this warre. But he found the Christians there shivered
into severall factions, and the two great Orders, Hospitallers
and Templars, two great confusions of the Holy cause. Of these
the Hospitallers were the seniors in standing, their originall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dated eighteen years before the Templars; and therefore
challenged superiority. But that which made the younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
so brisk, was, that he was his fathers darling. The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars
in all their broils had support from the Pope, because the
others were suspected to have a smack of the Imperiall faction.
This made them active, daring, offering of affronts: And what
countrey-men soever the Templars were, they were alwayes
Italians, that is, true to the Triple Crown. These being madded
with ambition, were the more outragious for their high fare

the happinesse with little cost to purchase much credit; and the
living being much taken with kindnesse to the dead, this burying
of those Christians, with pious persons wonne him as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
as if he killed so many Turks.</p>
                  <p>At last the truce for ten years was concluded with the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;<note place="margin">1241</note>
all Christian captives were discharged and set free, many
forts of them restored, and matters for the main reduced to the
same estate they were at the first peace with Frederick the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour;
and Richard returning through Sicily and by Rome,
where he visited his Holinesse, safely came home to England:
Where he was welcomed with bad news, that a discontented
Cornish-man, banished for his misdemeanours, had found out
tinne-mines in<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, pag. 765.</note> Bohemia; which afterwards more asswaged
the swelling of this Earls bags then all his voyage to Palestine:
For till that time that metall was onely fetched from England,
which afforded meat to some forrein countreys, and dishes
to all.</p>
                  <p>His voyage was variously censured: The Templars which
consented not to the peace, flouted thereat, as if all this while
he had laboured about a difficult nothing, and as good never a
whit as never the better, for the agreement would never hold
long. Others thought he had abundantly satisfied any rationall
expectation: For he<note n="*" place="margin">Cambden, in Cornwall.</note> compelled, saith one, the Saracens to
truce, (a strange compulsion without, violence, except the shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a scabbard) he restored many to the life of their life, their
liberty; which alone was worth all his pains; the peace he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:94789:103"/>
was honourable; and a cheap Olive-branch is better then
dear Bayes.</p>
                  <p>Two of our English Richards were at Palestine; one famous
for drawing his sword, the other his purse. He was also remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
herein, that he brought all his men and ships safe home,
(next of kin to a miracle) and none will deny, but that in such
dangerous adventures a saver is a gainer. One good he got
hereby, This journey brought him into play amongst forrein
Princes; henceforward the beyond-sea-world took notice of
him, and he of it. Never would he have had the face to have
courted the Crown Imperiall, if these his travels had not put
boldnesse and audacity into him, which made him afterwards a
stiff rivall to bid for the Empire of Germany.</p>

                  <p>ABout this time (though we find not the punctuall date there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of)
happened the death of Reinoldus Fredericks Lieutenant
in Syria, who by his moderation had been a good bene factour to
the Holy warre. But the Templars counted him to want metall,
because he would not be mad and causelesly break the truce with
the Sultan. In his grave was buried the happinesse of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
in Palestine: for now the lawlesse Templars observe no
other rule but their own will.</p>
                  <p>And now the inundation of the Tartarians in spite of all
dammes and banks overranne the North of Asia, and many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
fled from their own countreys for fear of them. Amongst
other the Corasines (called by some Choermines, and Gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a fierce and warlike people, were notwithstanding by the
Tartarians forced to forsake their land.</p>
                  <p>Being thus unkennelled, they had their recourse to the Sultan
of Babylon, and petitioned him to bestow some habitation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

them to be joynt-tenants in the same countrey with the
Turks, was a present inconvenience, and would be a future mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.
In stead therefore of giving them a house, he sent them
to a work-house; yet so, that they apprehended it a great cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
done unto them: For he bestowed on them all the lands
which the Christians held in Palestine; liberall to give away
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:94789:104"/>
what was none of his, and what the others must purchase before
they could enjoy. The Sultan encouraged them to invade that
countrey; whose people he pretended were weak and few, the
land wealthy and fruitfull, so that the conquest would be easie,
especially they having his assistance in the present service, and
perpetuall patronage hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Animated herewith in come the Corasines with their wives
and children (bringing their housholds with them to win houses
and lands for them) into Syria, and march directly to Jerusalem;
which being a weak and unfortified place,<note place="margin">1244</note> was taken without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.
Weak and unfortified! Strange! It is confessed on all
sides, that Frederick the Emperour and Reinoldus his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
spared no expense in strengthening this city; since which
time we find no solemn taking it by the Turks: Who then can
expect lesse then an impregnable place, where so much cost was
sown? Which driveth us to conceive one of these three things;
Either that the weaknesse of this citie was chiefly in the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
hearts; Or else that formerly there happened some blind
and silent dispoiling of this place not mentioned by Authours;
Or lastly, that Jerusalem was a Jericho, I mean, a place cursed in
building, like Pharaohs lean kine, never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus this city, after that it had been possessed fifteen years
by the Christians, was wonne by this barbarous people, never
since regained to our religion. Sleep, Jerusalem, sleep in thy ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines,
at this day of little beauty and lesse strength, famous onely
for what thou hast been.</p>
                  <p>The Christians flying out of Jerusalem with their families,
took their course towards Joppa; but looking back, beheld their
own ensignes advanced on the city-walls, so done in policie by
their enemies. Whereupon their credulity thus commented,
That their fellows had beaten the Corasines in Jerusalem, and
by these<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, pag. 835.</note> banners invited them to return: But going back, they

not to send some spies to taste the bait before all swallowed

                  <p>Robert Patriarch of Jerusalem was a most active commander
over all. S. Lukes day was the time agreed upon for the fatall
battel; near Tiberias was the place. As the Christians were
ordering themselves in aray, it was questioned in what part of
their armie their new Turkish assistants should be disposed, and
concluded that they should be placed in the front, where if they
did no other good, they would dull the appetite of their enemies
sword. This is thought to have been a notorious errour, and
cause of their overthrow. For though those souldiers who mean
to be false, will never be made faithfull in what place soever they
be bestowed, yet may they be made lesse dangerous if cast into
the body or main battel of the army, whence they have no such
scope to fling out, and to take advantage of place to do mischief,

side; though some braved them onely with cowardlinesse not
treachery, and that they fled from the battel but not fell to the
enemies. The Christians manfully stood to it, and though
over-powred in number, made a great slaughter of their enemies,
till at last they were quite overthrown. Of the Teutonick Order
escaped but three; of three hundred Templars, but eighteen; of
two hundred Hospitallers, but nineteen: The patriarch (to use
his own words) whom God reputed unworthy of martyrdome,
saved himself by flight, with a few others. And this great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
to omit lesse partner-causes, is chiefly imputed to the
Templars former so often breaking the truce with the Sultan of

                  <p>Thus were the Christians conquered by the Corasines, and

The occasion of his journey, and his attendants.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>SOme two years after, Lewis the ninth of that name, King of
France, came to assist the Christians. The occasion of his
voyage, this; He had been visited with a desperate sicknesse,
insomuch that all art cried craven, as unable to help him; and
the Physicians resigned him to Divines, to begin with him
where they ended: They also gave him over; and for a while
he lay in a trance,<note place="margin">1245</note> not the least breath brought news of any life
left in him. Then Blanch the Queen-mother (and Queen of
mothers for her care of her sonne and his Kingdome)<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, pag. 880. Et P. Aemyl. in D. Ludov. pag. 214.</note> applied
a piece of the Crosse unto him. Thereat (whether thereby, let
others dispute) he revived and recovered; and thereupon was
Croised, and in thankfulnesse bound himself with a vow to sail
to the Holy land. But his Nobility disswaded him from that
designe: The dangers were certain, the successe would be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of so long a journey; his own Kingdome would be left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:94789:105"/>
and many mischiefs unseen as yet, would appear in his
absence: Besides, his vow was made in his sicknesse, whilest
reason was scarce as yet in the peaceable possession of his mind,
because of the remnant-dregs of his disease: It might also be
dispensed with by the Pope; yea, his deserts did challenge so
much from his Holinesse. King Lewis, as perswaded hereat, laid
down the Crosse to the great comfort and contentment of all
the beholders: But then<note n="*" place="margin">Fox, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrolog. pag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 293.</note> altering his countenance, he required
the Crosse should be restored to him again, and vowed to eat no
bread untill he was recognized with the Pilgrimes badge. And
because his vow should suffer no diminution or abatement from
his disease, now no longer Lewis the sick, but Lewis the sound
undertook the holy Warre. His Nobles seeing him too stiff to
be unbent, and counting it a kind of sacrilegious counsel to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him from so pious a work, left him to his own resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
There went along with him his two brothers, Charles
Earl of Anjou, Robert Earl of Artois, his own Queen, and
their Ladies, Odo the Popes Legate, Hugh Duke of Burgundie,
William Earl of Flanders, Hugh Earl of St. Paul, and William
Longspath Earl of Sarisbury with a band of valiant English
men, who went without licence from Henry King of England:
For in those dayes this doctrine went currant, That their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
leave was rather of complement then essentiall to their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
as if the band of this holy Warre was an acquitance from
all others. Our Henry displeased at this Earls departure, for his
disobedience deprived him of his Earldome and castle of Saris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
not suffering that sheep to grase in his pasture which would
not own him for his shepherd. William also sonne to this
<note n="*" place="margin">Camden, in Wiltshire.</note> Earl, smarting for his fathers fault, never enjoyed that honour.
And though King Henry himself being a Prince of more devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then policie, did most affectionately tender this Holy cause,
yet he used this necessary severity towards this Earl at this time;
first, because it would weaken his land thus to be dispeopled of
martiall men; secondly, his subjects forwardnesse might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
a secret check of his own backwardnesse in that warre;
thirdly, the sucking in of forrein aire did wean people from
their naturall Prince, and did insensibly usher into their hearts
an alienation from their own Sovereigne, and a dependence on
the King of France; lastly, he had some thoughts on that voyage
himself, and reserved such prime Peers to attend on his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
thither.</p>
                  <p>The Pope gave to this King Lewis his charges,<note place="margin">1246</note> the tenth of
the Clergies revenues through France for three years; and the
King imployed the Popes collectours to gather it, knowing those
leaches were the best suckers. Hereupon the states of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
were shaved as bare as their crowns; and a poore Priest who
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:94789:106"/>
had but twenty shillings annuall pension, was forced to pay two
yearly to the King: And this by my<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. in anno 1246. pag. 943.</note> Authour is made the
cause of his following ill successe, there being much extortion
used by his under-officers. No wonder then if the wings of
that army did quickly flag, having so heavy a weight of curses
hanging upon them. And though money be the sinews of warre,
yet ill-gotten money, like gouty sinews, rather paineth then
strengtheneth. True it is, that this pious King was no way guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thereof, but such as were under him; and oftentimes the head
doth ach for the ill vapours of the stomach. He himself most
princely caused to be proclaimed through his realm, If any
merchant or other had been at any time injured by the Kings

bring forth his bill, shewing how and wherein, and he should be
recompensed. How this was performed we find not; but it was
a good lenitive plaister to asswage the peoples pain for the
present.</p>
                  <p>Having at Lyons took his leave of the Pope, and a blessing
from him, he marched towards Avignon: Where some of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

to suck the milk of sweet doctrine from so sowre and bitter

Yea, never could the Christian religion be shewed to<note n="*" place="margin">P. Aemyl. ut priús.</note> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
at any time on more disadvantages: Grecians and Latines
were at deadly feud; amongst the Latines, Guelfes and Gibel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
sought to ruine each other: Humility was every-where
preached, and pride practised: They perswaded others to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for heaven, and fell out about earth themselves: Their
lives were contrary to their doctrines, and their doctrines one to
another.</p>
                  <p>But as for these Embassadours,<note place="margin">1249</note> King Lewis received them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
courteously, dismissing them with bounteous gifts. And by
them he sent to their master a Ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Whilest Lewis stayed in Cyprus, the Templars in the Holy
land began to have his greatnesse in suspicion. This Order (as
both the other, of Hospitallers and Teutonicks) though mown
down to the bare roots at the last unfortunate battel, yet now in
three years space sprung up as populous as ever before; their
other brethren which lived in their severall Covents and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandries
over all Europe, having now refurnished the houses in
Palestine.</p>
                  <p>Now these Templars were loth King Lewis should come to

there. They formerly there had commanded in chief
without controll, and were unwilling, having long sat in the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
now to dismount and hold the stirrup to another. Besides,
they would not have so neat and cleanly a guest see their slutrish
houses, fearing Lewis his piety would shame their dissolutenesse,
(being one so godly in his conversation, that by the preaching
in his life he had converted many<note n="*" place="margin">P. Aemyl. pag. 216.</note> Saracens) yea, perchance he
being a strict Disciplinarian would punish their vicious manners.
Wherefore they wrote to him out of Syria, to accept of a peace
with the Sultan of Egypt now offered, and to proceed no further

had leisure to flie away, and Meladine the Egyptian King to
provide himself to make resistance. Last time (some thirty years
before) when the Christians under John Bren invaded Egypt, they
were not impeached in their arrivall, but suffered to land with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any opposition. But Meladine now was sensible of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity
in permitting his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oes safely to come on shore: For
first, they wasted and spoiled the countrey &amp; the provision about
them: Secondly, opportunity was given to male contents and
ill-disposed persons to flie to the enemy: Lastly, he found it
most policy to keep the enemy off at arms end, and to close at
the last; and not to adventure his Kingdome on the single die of
a battel, but rather to set it on a chance, that so he might have
the more play for it. Wherefore he resolved to strengthen his
maritime places, and not suffer them to land; though also here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he met with many difficulties. For as nothing was more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
then that Lewis would set on Egypt, so nothing more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain;
and because it was unknown at what time or place he
would come, all times and places were provided for. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted
a masse of treasure to keep in pay so many souldiers for
many moneths together. But it is no time to dispute about un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
thirft, when a whole Kingdome is brought into questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be subdued.</p>
                  <p>And because the landing-places in Egypt are of great disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94789:107"/>
to the defendants, yielding them no shelter from the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of their enemies artillery, being all open places and plain (the
shores there being not shod against the sea with huge high rocks,
as they are in some other countreys, because the land is low and
level) Meladine was forced to fortifie welnigh an hundred and
eighty miles along the sea-side; and what Nature had left bare,
Art put the more clothes on; and by using of great industry (such
as by Tully is fitly termed <hi>horribilis industria</hi>) in short space all
that part of Egypt was fenced which respecteth the sea.</p>
                  <p>Winter being past, Robert Duke of Burgundie, and Alphonse
King Lewis his brother arrived in Cyprus with a new army;
and hereupon they concluded to set forward for Egypt, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to land near Damiata.<note place="margin">Iune 4.</note> But the governour thereof with
a band of valiant souldiers stoutly resisted them. Here was a
doubtfull fight: The Egyptians standing on the firm ground,
were thereby enabled to improve and<note n="*" place="margin">P. Aemyl. pag. 216.</note> inforce their darts to the
utmost, whilest the French in their ticklish boats durst not make
the best of their own strength. Besides, those on land threw
their weapons downwards from the forts they had erected, so
that the declivity and downfall did naturally second the violent
impression of their darts. How-ever, the Infidels at last were
here beaten with what commonly was their own weapon, I
mean, multitude; so that they fled into the town,<note place="margin">5.</note> leaving behind
them their governour and five hundred of their best souldiers
dead on the shore.</p>
                  <p>Damiata was a strong city, the taking whereof was accounted
the good task of an army for a yeare. But now the Egyptians
within were presented afresh with the memory of the miseries
they indured in the last long siege by the Christians; and fearing
lest that tragedy should be acted over again, set fire on their
houses, and in the night saved themselves by flight. The French
issuing in quenched the fire,<note place="margin">9.</note> and rescued much corn and other
rich spoil from the teeth of the flame.</p>
                  <p>Meladine much troubled with this losse, to purchase peace
<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, pag. 1047.</note> offered the Christians all Jerusalem in as ample a manner as
ever formerly they had enjoyed it; all prisoners to be restored,
with a great summe of money to defray their charges, and many
other good conditions: So that we may much wonder at his
profusenesse in these profers, and more at the Christians indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
in their refusall. For though some advised to make much
of so frank a chapman, and not through covetousnesse to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
their market; yet the Popes Legate and Robert Earl of
Artois,<note place="margin">Knolls, Turk. Hist.</note> heightened with pride that they could not see their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
and measuring their future victories by the largenesse of

the best port in Egypt were also cast in for vantage, to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:94789:108"/>
make the conditions down-weight: And King Lewis, whose
nature was onely bad because it was so good, would in no wise
crosse his brother in what he desired. Whereupon the Turks
seeing themselves in so desperate condition, their swords being
sharpened on extremity, provided to defend their countrey to
the utmost.</p>

                  <p>ABout this time brake out the dissensions betwixt the French
and English. The cause whereof (as some say) was, for that
the Earl of Sarisbury in sacking a fort got more spoil then the
French. But surely the foundation of their discontents lay much
lower, being on old enmity betwixt the two nations, and Robert
Earl of Artois used Earl William and his men with much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courtesie.</p>
                  <p>The Robert stood much on the Royaltie of his descent, being
brother to King Lewis, though nothing of kin in conditions,
being as bountifull to deal injuries and affronts as the other alms
and charitable deeds. The English Earl, though he stood on the
lower ground in point of birth, yet conceived himself to even
him in valour and martiall knowledge. And though godly King
Lewis used all his holy-water to quench these heart-burnings,
his successe answered not this pains, much lesse his desires; onely
his cooling perswasions laid their enmities for the present fairly
asleep.</p>
                  <p>Amidst these broils died Meladine the Egyptian King. A
worthy Prince he was; though some write very coursely of him:
as he must rise early, yea, not at all go to bed, who will have
every ones good word. Let Christians speak of him as they
found: whose courtesies to them when they were half-drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Egypt, if they will not confesse, they deserve to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drowned for their ingratitude. In the latter end of his age he
quite lost the good will of his subjects, and lived unloved, and
died unlamented, though a deserving and fortunate man, which
oftentimes covereth a multitude of faults. The chief reason
whereof was, because they suspected him to be unsound in his
religion, and offering to Christianity: Besides, having reigned
above thirty years, his government became stale; and good
things, if of long continuance, grow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

affected for their variety then true worth: Lastly, the rising
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:94789:108"/>
sunne stole the adorers from the sunne setting; and Melechsala
his sonne being an active and promising Prince, reigned before
in mens desires over the Kingdome. To him now they all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied

deliver that Regall citie to the French. With some danger and

a fugitive Saracen to a place where it was foordable. Hence
Earl Robert marched forward with a third part of the army, and
suddenly assaulting the Turks in their tents (whilest Melechsala
was absent in solemnizing a feast) put them to flight. Hereupon
this Earl pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

This blow made his enemies reel, the next would fell them:
Now speed was more needfull then strength: This late victory,
though gotten, was lost if not used: What though they were

them therefore forwards, and set on the whole power of the
Turks, which was incamped not farre off.</p>
                  <p>But the Master of the Templars,<note place="margin">Matth. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. pag. 1049.</note> in whom the sap of youth
was well dried up, advised the Earl to stay and digest the honour
he had gotten, expecting the arrivall of the rest of their armie:
for the work was weighty they undertook, and needed two
shoulders, the united strength of the Christians, effectually to
manage it: His souldiers were weary, and must be refreshed;
and it was madnesse to starve them to day in hope of a feast to
morrow: That they were to march through a strange countrey,
and their best instructours were behind: let them stay for their
lantern, and not go in the dark. He minded him that he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued

long since had been wonne, but for the collusion of the false
Templars and Hospitallers with the Infidels.</p>
                  <p>Here the Earle of Sarisbury interposed himself to make peace,
and to perswade Robert to listen to the wholesome counsel
that was given him. But his good will was rewarded with Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
Dastard, English tail, and such like contumelious terms.
Wherefore said our Earl, Well, Generall, on in Gods name;

brasse.</p>
                  <p>Marching on, they assaulted the castle of Mauzar, and were
notably repulsed; and Melechsala coming in with his whole
strength, hemmed them in on every side. The Christians were
but the third part of the armie; and at the present, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
were scarce the half of themselves, being faint for want
of refreshing. Yet never shall one read more valour in so little
a volume: They played their parts most stoutly. As for the
French Earl who went on like thunder, he went out like smoke,
crying to the Earl of Sarisbury, Flee, flee, for God fighteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us. To whom our Earl, God forbid my fathers sonne
should flee fom the face of a Saracen. The other seeking to save
himself by the swiftnesse of his horse, and crossing the river, had
there water enough to drown him, but too little to wash from
him the stain of rashnesse and cowardise. Thus died the Earl of
Artois: who had in him the parts of a good Generall, but inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and in transposition, bold in counsel, fearfull in execution.
He was one of that princely quaternion of brothers which came
hither at this voyage, and exceeded each other in some quality;
Lewis the Holiest, Alphonse the Subtillest, Charles the Stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
and this Robert the Proudest.</p>
                  <p>As for the Earl of Sarisbury, he resolved to sell his life at such
a rate that the buyer should little boast of his penny-worth, slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many a Turk; and though unhorsed and wounded in his
legs, stood on his honour when he could not stand on his feet;
and refusing all quarter, upon his knees laid about him like a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
man. The longer he fought, the fewer wounds he had;
and there at last he breathed forth his soul in the middest of his
enemies. Of all the Christians there escaped no more then two

                  </argument>
                  <p>IT is easier to be conceived then expressed, what generall grief
this dolefull news brought to the French; who followed not
farre off, and who before had cause enough to sorrow for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
For the plague began to rage furiously amongst them,
and daily swept away thousands. Mean time good King Lewis
sent many of the weakest and impotentest people down the river
to Damiata, there to enjoy the benefit of privacie, good atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
and physick. Melechsala having intelligence hereof, met
them by the way; and setting upon them (having neither arm to
fight, nor legs to runne away) either burned or drowned them
all, save one English man, Alexander Giffard (whose ancient
and famous family flourisheth to this day at Chellington in
Staffordshire) who wounded in five places of his bodie, escaped
to the French, and reported what had happened to the rest.</p>
                  <p>And by this time Melechasala understood of the correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
betwixt King Lewis and the governour of Cairo, for the
betraying of the city: Whereupon he caused him suddenly to
be apprehended; whereby the French King lost all hopes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that place of importance. Yea, now full willingly would
the Christians have accepted the terms formerly offered them;
and now their hungry stomachs would make dainties of those
conditions which before, when full of pride, they threw away
as fragments. But the Turks now sleighted them as not worth
the treating with; and as knowing that these Frenchmen, who
at their first landing were more then men, would at last be lesse
then women.</p>
                  <p>Then began the French Lords to perswade King Lewis to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:94789:110"/>
provide for the safety of his own person, and to return to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miata.
They told him, That if he stayed with them, there was no
hope grounded on probability (and what was any other but a
wilfull self-delusion?) of his escaping: If he were killed, his death
would be a living shame to their religion; if taken prisoner, how
would Mahomet insult over Christ! The captivity of the most
Christian of the most Christian Kings would be foundation

But Lewis would not leave them, that they might not
leave him, but resolved to be a commoner with them in weal
and wo; disdaining to be such a niggard of his life as not to
spend it in a good cause in so good company.</p>
                  <p>Forward they march, and come to the fatall place where the
last battel was fought. There behold the mangled, headlesse,
handlesse, feetlesse corpses of their fellow-countreymen. They
knew in generall they were all their friends; none knew his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
friend. The cause of this unwonted cruelty to the dead,
was a proclamation which Melechsala made, assigning a great
summe of money to every one who would bring the head,
hand, or foot of a Christian: And this made many of his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
cowards (who carried their valour in their purses) to be
couragious. Whilest the French were here bemoning their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
Melechsala came upon them with an infinite multitude,<note place="margin">Apr. 5.</note>
and put them all (being few and feeble) to the sword; taking
King Lewis, with his two brethren, Alphonse and Charles, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners.</p>
                  <p>Instantly the Turks went up with French ensignes to Damia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,

was redemption; but the Babylonian Caliph Hell it self, from
whence no hope of release. But God defeated their designe;
for the Turks could not French it so handsomely, but that they
were discovered. The very language of their hands made them
suspected afarre off, because they could not counterfeit the
French idiotismes in managing their bucklers, that nation being

of rhetotorick, there with to paint out the happinesse of their
estate which they enjoyed in heaven: They pieced out their
Sermons with reporting of Miracles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How William Earl of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risbury
appeared to his<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. pag. 1051.</note> mother, and assured her that he reigned
most glorious in heaven. She presently forgot her grief for lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
her sonne, for joy that she had found a Saint, yea, a Martyr.
This was their constant custome; When any in Europe wept for
the losse of their friends in this warre, their tears were instantly
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:94789:111"/>
dried up with some hot miracle that was reported them: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the silly people were well pleased; as babes of clouts are
good enough to keep children from crying.</p>
                  <p>About this time many thousands of the English were resolved
for the Holy warre, and would needs have been gone, had not
the King strictly guarded his ports, and kept his Kingdome from
running away out of doores. The King promised he would go
with them, and hereupon got a masse of mony from them for
this journey. Some say, that he never intended it; and that this
onely was a trick to stroke the skittish cow to get down her milk.
His stubborn subjects said, that they would tarry for his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
till midsummer, and no longer. Thus they weighed out their
obedience with their own scales, and the King stood to their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance.
But hearing of this sorrowfull accident, both Prince
and people altered their resolution; who had come too late to
help the French in their distresse, and too soon to bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the same misery.</p>

                     <p>King Lewis exchanged for Damiata, stayeth some
years at Ptolemais.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BUt to return to Egypt; where King Lewis was kept prisoner
by Melechsala, who often felt his disposition about the resign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Damiata, but found that to hear of death was more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
musick unto him.</p>
                  <p>But see here a sudden alteration: One Tarqueminus a sturdy
Mammaluke, with another of that society, killed Melechsala in
the very heighth of his victorious happinesse, and succeeded him in
the Egyptian Kingdome. This Tarquemine came in with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to send Lewis the same way: Which poor Prince was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
armed with innocence and Majestie, and yet his bare person
defended his person from that cruel attempt: such an awfull im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
did his very presence, saith my Authour, strike into
him who would have stricken him. But we may rather think
that the city of Damiata was King Lewis his corslet, and that all
the towres and walls of that place fenced him; Tarquemnius re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
his person as an equivalent ransome, thereby to redeem
that royall citie.</p>
                  <p>Now Lewis had changed his Lord, but not his lamentable
condition, continuing still a prisoner. At last he was restored to
his liberty, on condition, that the Christians should surrender
Damiata, and he also pay back to the Turks many thousand
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:94789:111"/>
pounds, both for ransome of Christian captives, and in satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the vastations they had committed in Egypt. Lewis for
security of this money, pawned to the Turk the Pyx and Host
(that is, the body of Christ transsubstantiated in the Eucharist)
as his chiefest jewel which he should be most carefull to redeem.
Hence, in perpetuall memory of this conquest, we may see a
<note n="*" place="margin">Du Serres, in the life of Lewis the 9.</note> Wafer-cake and a box alwayes wrought in the borders of that
tapestry which is brought out of Egypt.</p>
                  <p>Note by the way, That the Turks were most unreasonable in
their rates of ransoming souldiers, and in all other their pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
demands. For their own countrey being near to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of gold and silver, they made as if it flowed as plentifully in
other places, measuring the wealth of other lands by their own,
and asking as much for a private mans ransome as would drain a
Princes purse in these Western parts.</p>
                  <p>Thus was Damiata restored again to the Turks, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
punctually performed their promises; though the false
Miscreant on the other side set not half the captives free, killed
all the sick persons whom by promise he should relieve, and
(contrary to the agreement) suffered not any Christian to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
any of his goods out of Egypt.</p>
                  <p>Hence Lewis sailed to Ptolemais: where he lived in a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
case, being forsaken of his brothers, subjects, friends, and the
Pope himself. His brothers, Alphonse and Charles, though sent
into France to solicite his suit, and to advance his ransome with
speed, yet being arrived forgot the affliction of Joseph; and the
King was as farre from their mind as their sight: Wherefore
God justly visited Alphonse with an incurable disease. His sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
though furious at first in bemoning him, yet the fit past,
complained not so much for him as on him; charging him for
ill managing the matters in Egypt by his cowardlinesse and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion.
His friends the Pisans and Genoans reviled him as
the marrer of their mart, Damiata being formerly their most
gainfull port; but now their hony was spoiled by destroying
their hive: for the Sultan seing the city taken twice of the
Christians in short time, to prevent further dispute about it,
took away the subject of the question, and rased it to the
ground. The Pope forsook him: And though many intreated
his Holinesse not to prosecute the Emperour Frederick any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
from whom Lewis expected all the beams of his comfort,
yet he would hear of no submission from him, but sought fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to ruine him. Onely Blanch, King Lewis his mother, was
carefull for her sonne, and laboured his cause day and night. But
alas! her armes were too short to bring all ends together. And
having gathered a considerable summe of money, and shipped
it for Palestine, a tempest in a moment<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. pag. 1091.</note> cast that away which
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:94789:112"/>
her care and thrift was many moneths in getting. All this he
bore with a soul not benummed with Stoicall senslessenesse, but
becalmed with Christian patience:<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. pag. 1091.</note> a second Job; so that what
pleased God, pleased him. It somewhat mitigated his misery,
that he had the company of his consort Margaret, a woman wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
so good a husband. Here she bore him a child, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
another Benoni, or sonne of sorrow, was called Tristram.
But that<note n="*" place="margin">S<hi rend="sup">•</hi>. Tristram a Knight long before. <hi>See Carew, in Cornwall, fol.</hi> 61.</note> name is more ancient, nor had it its birth from the
christening of this child.</p>
                  <p>Foure yeares King Lewis lived (not to say, loitered) in Syria,
daily expecting in vain that some Prince of Europe should fetch
him off with honour, being loth to return till he could carry
home his credit with him. And though he was out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
yet was he in his Kingdome, whilest surveying there the
sacred monuments wherewith he was so highly affected.</p>

memorable, we will fetch it from its first originall.</p>
                  <p>Saladine (as is touched<note n="*" place="margin">Book. 2. chap. 40.</note> before) was the first of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish
Kings who began the gainfull trade of the Mammalukes.
These were Christian captives, brought out of Taurica Cher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesus,
and instructed as in Mahometanisme so in all military
discipline; Saladine disposing them in martiall nurseries, and
continuing a constant succession of them one under another. It
is above belief how much and speedily they were improved in
warlike exercises: Art doubled their strength by teaching them
to use it. And though they came rough out of their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
they were quickly hewen and polished by education: yea,
their apprehensions prevented the precepts, and their practise
surpassed the presidents of those that instructed them. As it is
observed in fruits and flowers, that they are much bettered by
change to a fitter soil; so were these people by altering their
climate: the cold countrey wherein they were bred, gave them
big and robustious bodies; and the hot climate whereinto they
were transplanted, ripened their wits, and bestowed upon them
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:94789:112"/>
craft and activity, the dowrie of the Southern countreys. They
attained to be expert in any service; especially they were excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
horsemen: and at last they began to ride on the backs and
necks of the Turkish Kings themselves.</p>
                  <p>True it is, Saladine kept his distance over them, used them
kindly, yet made them not wantons; and so poised these Mamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lukes
with his native Egyptians, that in all actions he still reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the casting voice for himself. But Meladine and Melechsala
his successours, entertained them without number, and instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them beyond reason, so that under them in a manner they
monopolized all places of strength and command; till at last,
the stemme of these mercenary souldiers being too great for the
stock of the natives, the Turkish Kingdome in Egypt, like a top-heavy
tree, became a windfall. Indeed, the dastardnesse of the
Egyptians made these Mammalukes more daring and insolent.
For the Egyptians more loved profit then honour, and wealth
then greatnesse; and though contented to abide labour, would in
no wise undergo danger. Merchandise they where wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in; and it seemed they used trading so long, till at last
they made sale of their own spirits. Yea, one could not now know
Egypt to be Egypt, but onely by the overflowing of Nilus, not
by any remaining ancient marks of valour in the peoples disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Thus the <hi>genius</hi> of old Kingdomes in time groweth weaker,
and doteth at the last.</p>
                  <p>But to come to Tarqueminus; He being one of these Mamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lukes,
and perceiving how easie it was for those that did sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
to supplant the Turkish Kings, with another of his associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
slew Melechsala, as it was said. And because it was unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
so great a Prince should go to the grave alone, he also sent
his children and intimate friends thither to attend him. Tarque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus
afterwards procured of his society to be chosen King of
Egypt. He was the Solon or Lycurgus of this slavish common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and by the consent of the rest of his company he enacted
many laws: Whereof these were those of the Grand Charter,
which admitted of no revocation:</p>
                  <p>First, That the<note n="*" place="margin">Knolls, Turk. Hist. pag. 107.</note> Sultan, or chief of this servile Empire, should
be chosen alwayes out of the Mammalukes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That none should be admitted to the Order of the
Mammalukes which were either Jews or Turks by birth, but
onely such as being born Christians, were afterwards taken ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives,
and then from the time of their slavery had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in the Mahometane religion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That though the sonnes of the Mammalukes might
enjoy their fathers lands and wealth, yet they might not take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them the name or honour of a Mammaluke.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That the native Egyptians should be permitted no
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:94789:113"/>
use of weapons, but onely such as with which they fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
weeds, to till and manure the land.</p>
                  <p>In surveying this State, we can turn no way but must meet
with wonders:</p>
                  <p>First, one would think that there was such an indelible cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of slavery in these captives, and such a <hi>laesum principium</hi>
in them, that none of them ever should make a good Prince, as
knowing no more how to sway a scepter then a pure clown to
manage a sword<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or else that they should over-state it, turn ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
and onely exchange their slavery, by becoming vassals to
their own passions. Yet many of them in their kinds were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Princes for government, no whit inferiour to those which
are advantaged with royall birth and breeding.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is a wonder they should be so neglective of their
own children. How many make an idol of their posterity, and
sacrifice themselves unto it, stripping themselves out of necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to provide their heirs a wardrobe! yea, it is a principle in
most moderate minds, to advance their posterity; thinking here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
in a manner they overcome death, and immortalize their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories,
in leaving their names and honours to their children:
Whereas the contrary appeared in these Mammalukes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is admirable that they fell not out in the election of
their Prince, being in a manner all equall amongst themselves.
We see elective States in Christendome, though bound with the
straitest laws, often sagge aside into schismes and factions; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
this strange Empire in their choice had no dangerous discords,
but such as were quenched in the kindling.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, who ever knew a wall that had no better cement, to
stand so sure and so long? Two hundred sixty and seven years
this State endured; and yet had it to do with strong and puissant
enemies. Some Kingdomes ow their greatnesse not so much to
their own valour and wisdome as to the weaknesse of their
neighbours: but it fared not thus with the Mammalukes. To
omit Prester John, who neighboured them on the south; on all
other sides they were encompassed with potent opposers: From
whom right valiantly they defended themselves, till in the yeare
1517 they were overcome by Selimus the great Turkish Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</p>
                  <p>To conclude; As for the Amazons and their brave atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
with much valour and no manhood; they and their State
had onely being in the brains of fabulous writers: As for the
Assasines, or regiment of rogues; it never spread to the breadth
of any great countrey, nor grew to the height of a Kingdome;
but being the jakes of the world, was cast out in a place betwixt
barren hills: But this Empire of vassals was every way won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull,
stretching so farre over all Egypt and most of Syria,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:94789:113"/>
and lasting so long. A strange State! wherein slavery was the
first step to their throne, and apostasle the first article in their
religion.</p>

                  <p>IN this same yeare Frederick King of Jerusalem and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of Germanie ended his troublesome dayes. A Prince,
who in the race of his life met with many rubs, some stumbles,
no dangerous fall. Besides the Turk, he had to do with the
Pope (the Pope immortall in his succession.) And though his
Holinesse was unfit for warre (as being alwayes old, and never
ripe for that place till almost rotten) yet he used his own head,
and commanded the hands of others; whereby he kept Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
in a continuall warre. Yet never could he have beaten him
with fair play, had he not used a weapon, if not against the law
of Arms, against the law of God, and against which no guard,
Arming his subjects against him, and Dispensing with the oath
of allegeance.</p>
                  <p>But he gave Frederick the mortall wound, in setting himself
against himself; I mean, Henry his eldest sonne. And though
Frederick easily conquered that rebellious youth, and made him
fast enough, keeping him in prison in Apulia, where he died: yet
he carried the grief hereof to his grave. For now he knew not
where or in whom to place any confidence; as suspecting the
single cord of Loyalty would not hold in others, which brake in
his own sonne though twisted with Naturall affection.</p>
                  <p>The greatnesse of his spirit was a great hastening of his death;
and being of a keen, eager, and active nature, the sharpnesse of
the sword cut the scabbard the sooner asunder. Bow he could
not, break he must. What-ever is reported, he died of no other
poison then sorrow, (which ushered him into a wasting ague)
grief being a burden whereof the strongest shoulders can bear

ground them to powder who in his life-time durst have aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it. Indeed he was very happy in mechanicall matters, such
as we may term Liberall handicrafts; as casting, founding,
carving in iron and brasse: Nether did this argue a low soul,
to dabble in such mean imployments, but rather proved the
amplitude and largenesse thereof; of so generall acquaintance,
that no Art was a stranger to him. But the suspicion of his
birth rose from the almost miraculous manner of it; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia
his mother bearing him when welnigh sixty years of
age. But both in Scripture and other writers, we may see the
sonnes of long barren-mothers to have been fruitfull in famous

                  <p>Pity it was that he had some faults: yea, pity it had been if he

Many wives and concubines he had, and by them
many children.

age and misery will alter them. The credulity of the vulgar sort
presently betrayed them to be couzened by him: yea, some
Princes took this brasse for gold without touching it. But the
best engine which gave this puppet his motion, was a bruit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
buzzed, That Frederick was not dead. For Princes, the
manner of whole deaths hath been private and obscure, fame
commonly conjureth again out of their graves, and they walk
abroad in the tongues and brains of many, who affirm and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them to be still alive. But the world soon suifeted of this
cheaters forgerie; and this glow-worm when brought into the
light, shined no more, but at Nantes was burnt to ashes by Rodul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus
the Emperour.</p>
                  <p>After Fredericks death there was an <hi>interregnum</hi> for three and
twenty yeares in the Empire of Germany. True it is, that of
some, William Earl of Holland (one without a beard, not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour)
was nominated Emperour. The Spirituall electours chose
Richard, brother to our King Henry the third. And as in Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall
he got much coin, so Germany gave him a bottomlesse bag
to put it in. A third party named Alphonse King of Castile, an

                  <p>The Holy Lamb was their ensigne, but their actions neither
holy nor lambe-like. They pillaged and killed the poor Jews
as they went (an unhappy nation, whose heads lie pat for every
ones hands to hit, and their legges so stand in mens way that few
can go by them without spurning at them:) Where they wanted
Jews, they made Jews of Christians, especially if they were
rich, using them with all cruelty. But at last near Burdeaux
threescore thousand of them were slain, and the rest dispersed.

all Asia: Let him not count that he lay out of their rode,
because of his remote situation: For what is the way wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
will not trace? He might expect onely this courtesie, to be

this Pagan, that he not onely promised his assistance, but also
was baptised,<note place="margin">1254</note> and took the Christian religion on him: So also
did his whole countrey by his example; and Christianity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Court-fashion, none would be out of it. Never since
the time of Constantine the Great, did the devill at once lose a
greater morsel, or was there made a more hopefull accession to

                  <p>Understand we this conversion of Tartary (though Authours

the Eastern and most refined part of that Empire: For
Cannibals were still in the North, who needed first to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted

                  <p>BUt they were unworthy of this happinesse, who would not
be at leisure to make use of it, but busied themselves in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
dissensions, the Genoans against the Pisans and Venetians.
These States (as many other in Italy) at this time were so proud
in their Masters old clothes, they scarce knew themselves,
grown brave with the feathers the Eagle had moulted, and
set up by the breaking of the Emperour in Italy. The Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
and Genoans were hardly matched: The Pisans were not
so strong, but as stomachfull as either of them, and then in this
point of policie superiour to both; That first siding with the
Genoans, they whipped the Venetians: then when they were
sufficiently humbled, taking part with the Venetians, they strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
and Iashed the Genoans: and the scales being even before,
Pisa made that weigh down by course wherein she cast her
grains.</p>
                  <p>Now not content to fall out at home within the dores of
Italy, they must fight in Syria in the open street, where the
Turks looked on and laughed at them; counting it in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
as good sport as to see a spider poison a toad. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
their old grudges transported hither out of Italy, this green
wound was the cause of their dissension here: In Ptolemais
these three States had their severall streets, severall markets for
trading, and courts for causes both civill and criminall: but all
three had one Church (that of S. Sabbas) common unto them,
by the ordering of the Pope himself; who counted the same
Church might serve the worshipers of the same God: But
the<note n="*" place="margin">So saith Blondus. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cad. 2. lib. 8. pag. 308. But if we consult with Tyrius, lib. 10. cap. 28. the Genoans and not the Venetians wonne Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais.</note> Venetians by the virtue of an ancient agreement betwixt
them and King Baldwine for their service in winning this city,
challenged a peculiar interest therein. Hereabout was their old
bustling; and in a tumult, the Genoans at that time surpassing for
number, drave the Venetians out of the Church: Yea, Philip of
Montfort, a French Governour of Ptolemais in the time of
the <hi>interregnum,</hi> wanting not onely policie for a Magistrate, but
wit for a man (Blondus<note n="*" place="margin">L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>co priùs citato.</note> saith he was half-mad, and his actions
speak him no lesse) compelled the Venetians generally to forsake
the city.</p>
                  <p>Implacably incensed hereat, the Venetians arm thirteen galleys
which they had at Tyre, and coming to Ptolemais forc'd a sunder
the chain which crossed the haven, and burned five and twenty
ships of the Genoans which lay there. For alas! being strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:94789:117"/>
in the haven, they had no room (being intangled) to turn
and free themselves one from another. And though united force
be most forcible, yet not when so stifled and smothered that it
cannot expresse and exercise it self. Many brave souldiers in
these ships lost their lives in a bundle, without selling them, or
ever opening their wares.</p>
                  <p>To avenge this losse, the State of Genoa sent from home a
navie of fiftie ships of all sorts, which came to Tyre. There meet
they with Reinetius Zenus Duke of Venice, with the united pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Venetians and Pisans, counting no fewer then seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
four vessels well provided. They would have fought in the
very haven of Tyre, but the Governour of the city forbad it: It
would be more scandalous to Christianity; The roving fireballs
might hurt the city, and sinking ships hinder the harbour; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the conquered party would probably complain of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
of the place, that it more favoured one side; They should
not fight under his nose; if they had a mind to it, let them out
and try their fortunes in the open sea.</p>

honour.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>ACcordingly it was performed; out they go and fall to their
work. Their gallies, like Ostriches, used their legges more
then their wings, more running with oars then flying with sails.
At that time, before Ordinance was found out, ships were both
gunnes and bullets themselves, and furiously ranne one against
another.</p>
                  <p>They began with this arietation: Herein strength was much
but not all; nimblenesse was also very advantageous to break
and slent the down-right rushings of a stronger vessel. Then fell
they to grappling: Here the steady ship had the better of it; and
those souldiers who best kept their legges could best use their
arms, the surest stander being alwayes the foundest striker. Much
valour was shewed on both sides, and at last the victory fell to
the Venetian. The Genoans losing five and twenty of their
ships, fled, and saved the rest in the haven of Tyre, after a most
cruel and desperate battel.</p>

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:94789:117"/>
wind and water (like those wounds so often mentioned in
the Scripture under the fifth rib) is commonly observed mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.
Yea, full harder it is for a ship, when arrested and ingaged
in a battel, to clear it self, then for souldiers by land to save
themselves by flight. Here neither his own two nor his horses
four legges can bestead any; but like accidents they must pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
with their subjects, and sink with their ship.</p>
                  <p>And then why is the sea victory lesse honour, being more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
then one atchieved by land? Is it because sea-service is not
so generall, nor so full of varieties, and the mysteries thereof
sooner learned? or because in sea-fights fortune may seem to be
a deeper sharer, and valour not so much interested? Whatsoever
it is, the laurel purchased on land hath a more lively verdure
then that which is got at sea.</p>
                  <p>We return to the Venetians: who using or rather abusing
this conquest, enter Ptolemais, cast out all Genoans thence,
throw down their buildings both publick and private, demolish
the fort which they had builded at S. Saba, rifle and spoil their
shops, warehouses and storehouses: onely the Pope prevailed
so farre with them, that they set at liberty the prisoners they
had taken.</p>
                  <p>Ten years did this warre last betwixt these two States in
Syria, composed at last (saith my Authour) by the authority
of Pope Clement the fourth, and by famine (the bad cause of
a good effect) which in Palestine starved them into agreement.
Longer these warres lasted betwixt them in Italy: their successe,
like the sea they fought on, ebbing and flowing. In this costly
warre Pisa was first beggered; and for all her politick parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
Genoa at last trode so heavy upon her, that ever since she
hath drooped and hung the wing, and at this day is maid to
Florence, who formerly was mistresse of a good part of Italy.
But I have no calling and lesse comfort to prosecute these
bloudy dissensions: For warres of Christians against Infidels
are like the heat of exercise, which serveth to keep the body of
Christianity in health; but these civil warres amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
like the heat of a feaver, dangerous, and destructive of
religion.</p>

                  <p>This Guirboca, upon the occasion of his nephew rashly slain

Guirboca's nephew is slain: Hereat the Tartarians (who were
very humorous in their friendship; if not observed to an inch,
lost for ever) in discontent, all either reel aside to Mahomet, or
fall back to Paganisme.</p>
                  <p>Herein the Christians cannot be excused: Infant-converts must
be well tended. It had been discretion in them, even against
discretion to have yielded a little to these Tartarians, and so to
continue their amity, which was so advantageous to the Holy

warre. However, one may question the truth of their conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whether reall at first: This spring was too forward to hold;
and the speedy withering of their religion argueth it wanted
root. And as tame foxes, if they break loose and return wild, do
ten times more mischief then those which are wild from the
beginning; so these renegadoes raged more furiously then any
Pagans against religion. Guirboca sacrificed many Christians to
the ghost of his nephew, destroyed Cesarea and burnt it, using
all cruelty against the inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>Nor lesse were the Christians plagued at the same time with
Bendocdar the Mammaluke Prince in Egypt; who succeeded
Melechem, and every where raging against them, either killed
or forced them to forswear their religion. The city of Joppa
he took and burned;<note place="margin">1268</note> and then wonne Antioch, slaying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
twenty thousand, and carrying away captive an hundred
thousand Christians. But it may justly be suspected that these
numbers were written first in figures, and therefore at too
much length, when the adding of nothing may increase many
thousands.</p>
                  <p>These wofull tidings brought into Europe, so wrought on
the good disposition of Lewis King of France, that he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to make a second voyage into Palestine to succour the
Christians.</p>
                  <p>He so fixed his mind on the journeys end, that he saw not the
dangers in the way. His Counsel could not disswade, though
they did disswade him. First, they urged, that he was old; let
younger men take their turns: They recounted to him his former
ill successe; How lately had that hot countrey scorch'd the lilies
of France, not onely to the blasting of the leaves, but almost wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of the root? Besides, the sinews of the Christians in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
were so shrunk, that though lifted up, they could not stand;
That Nature decayed, but not thus wholly destroyed, was the
subject of physick; That the Turks had got a habit of conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and riveted themselves into the possession of the countrey;
so that this voyage would but fleet the cream of the Kingdome
to cast it into the fire.</p>
                  <p>But as a vehement flame maketh feuel of whatsoever it meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
so this Kings earnest resolution turned bridles into spurres,
and hind rances into motives to his journey. Was he old? let
him make the more speed, lest envious death should prevent him
of this occasion of honour. Had he sped ill formerly? he would
seek his credit where he lost it: Surely, Fortunes lottery had not
all blanks, but that after long drawing he should light on a prize
at last. Were the Christians in so low a case? the greater need
they had of speedy help.</p>
                  <p>Thus was this good Kings judgement over-zealed. And
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:94789:119"/>
surely though Devotion be the naturall heat, Discretion (which
wanted in him) is the radicall moisture of an action, keeping it
healthfull, prosperous, and long-lived.</p>
                  <p>Well, King Lewis will go, and to this end provideth his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie;
and is accompanied with Philip and Tristram his Sonnes,
Theobald King of Navarre his sonne in law, Alphonse his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Guido Earl of Flanders. There went also Edward
eldest sonne to Henry King of England. It was a wonder he
would now adventure his head when he was to receive a Crown,
his father being full-ripe to drop down without gathering, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
reigned longer then most men live, fifty and five yeares.
But thirsty was this Edward of honour: Longshanks was he
called: and as his strides were large, so vast and wide was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of his desire. As for his good Father, he was content to let
go the staff of his age for to be a prop to the Church. And
though King Lewis was undiscreet in going this journey, he was
wise in choosing this his companion, to have this active Prince
along with him; it being good to eye a suspicious person, and
not to leave him behind.</p>
                  <p>With Edward went his brother Edmund Earl of Lancaster,
surnamed Crouch-back; not that he was crook-shouldered, or
camel-backed: (From which our English Poet most zealously
doth vindicate him;

take the city of Carthage in Africa by the way.</p>
                  <p>This Carthage long wrastled with Rome for the sovereignty,

                  <p>Out of the ruines of this famous citie, Tunis arose; as often a

Yea, not considerable was Tunis then in bignesse, great
onely in mischief. But as a small scratch just upon the turning of
a joynt is more troublesome then a bigger sore in another place;
so this paltry town (the refuge of rogues, and wanderers home)
seated in the passage betwixt Europe, Asia, and Africa, was a
worse annoyance to Christian traffick then a whole countrey of,
Saracens elsewhere. Wherefore both to revenge the bloud of
many Christians, who passing this way to Palestine were either
killed or taken captive, as also to secure the way for the time to
come, Lewis with his whole fleet (augmented with the navy of
Charles King of Sicilie and Jerusalem, his brother) bent his
course to besiege it.</p>
                  <p>It was concluded both unnecessary and unfitting, first in a fair
way to summon the city; because like pernicious vermine they
were to be rooted out of the world by any means: nor was it
meet to lavish the solemn ceremonies of warre on a company of
thieves and murderers.</p>
                  <p>The siege was no sooner begun but the plague seised on the

with the stolen honie which they found in this hive of
drones: And which was worse, now their bellies were full they
would go to bed, return home, and goe no further. Yea, the
young King of France, called Philip the Bold, was fearfull to
prosecute his journey to Palestine; whereas Prince Edward
struck his breast, and swore, That though all his friends forsook

their ships being wracked, and the goods therein cast into the sea;
with which the waves played a little, and then chopped them
up at a morsel. Whilest the weather frowning on them, smiled

merited the esteem of a most stout man, he would still supere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate:
yea, he would profer to fight with any mean person,
if cried up by the <hi>volge</hi> for a tall man: this daring being
a generall fault in great spirits, and a great fault in a Generall,
who staketh a pearl against a piece of glasse. The best was,
in that age a man fighting with sword and buckler, had
in a manner many lives to lose; and duells were not
dangerous.</p>
                  <p>Whilest he stayed at Ptolemais, Elenor his Lady was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
of a fair daughter, called from her birth-place Joan of
Acres: But fear of her husbands death abated her joy at her
daughters birth. The Turks not matching him in valour, thought
to master him with treachery, which was thus contrived: The
Admirall of Joppa, a Turk, pretended he would turn Christian,
and imployed one Anzazim an Assasine in the businesse betwixt
him and Prince Edward; who carried himself so cunningly, that
by often repairing to our Prince he got much credit and esteem
with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Continuas. Matth. Paris. in <hi>anno</hi> 1272 pag. 1345.</note> Some write, this Anzazim was before alwayes bred under
ground, (as men keep hawks and warre-horses in the dark, to
make them more fierce) that so coming abroad, he should fear
to venture on no man. But sure, so cunning a companion had
long conversed with light, and been acquainted with men, yea,
Christians and Princes, as appeareth by his complying carriage;
else, if he had not been well read in their company, he could not
have been so perfect in his lesson. But let him be bred any where,
or in hell it self: For this was his religion, To kill any he was
commanded, or on the non-performance willingly to forfeit
his life.</p>
                  <p>The fifth time of his coming he brought Prince Edward
letters from his Master,<note place="margin">1272</note> which whilest he was reading alone and
lying on his bed, he struck him into the arm with an invenomed
knife. Being about to fetch another stroke, the Prince with his
foot gave him such a blow that he felled him to the ground;
and wresting the knife from him, ranne the Turk into the belly,
and slew him; yet so, that in struggling he hurt himself there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
in the forehead. At this noise in sprang his servants,
and one of them with a stool beate the braines out of the
dead Turks head, shewing little wit in his owne; and the
Prince was highly displeased, that the monument of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:94789:122"/>
should be stained with anothers crueltie.</p>
                  <p>It is storied, how<note n="*" place="margin">Speed, in Edward the first.</note> Elenor his Lady sucked all the poyson
out of his wounds, without doing any harm to her self: So

not be true, (with all the miracles in Lovers Legends) and
sure he shall get himself no credit, who undertaketh to confute
a passage so sounding to the honour of the sex: Yet can it not
stand with what<note n="*" place="margin">See Fox Martyrolog. pag. 337.</note> others have written; How the Physician
who was to dresse his wounds, spake to the Lord Edmund and
the Lord John Voysie to take away Lady Elenor out of the
Princes presence, lest her pitie should be cruell towards him,
in not suffering his sores to be searched to the quick. And
though she cried out and wrung her hands, Madame, said
they, be contented; it is better that one woman should weep a
little while, then that all the Realme of England should la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
a great season: And so they conducted her out of the
place. And the Prince, by the benefit of physick, good atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
and an antidote the Master of the Templars gave him,
shewed himself on horse-back whole and well within fifteen
dayes after.</p>
                  <p>The Admirall of Joppa hearing of his recoverie, utterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowed
that he had any hand in the treacherie: as none will
willingly father unsucceeding villany. True it is, he was truly
sorrowfull; whether because Edward was so bad, or no worse
wounded, he knoweth that knoweth hearts.<note n="*" place="margin">P. Aemyl. in D. Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vico, pag. 227.</note> Some wholly
acquit him herein, and conceive this mischief proceeded from
Simon Earl of Montforts hatred to our Prince, who bearing
him and all his kindred an old grudge for doing some conceived
wrong to his father, (in very deed, nothing but justice to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell)
hired, as they think, this Assasine to murder him; as a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
before for the same quarrell he had served Henry sonne to
Richard King of the Romanes, and our Edwards cousin ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
at Viterbo in Italy. It is much this Simon living in France
should contrive this Princes death in Palestine: but malice hath
long arms, and can take men off at great distance. Yea, this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to the cunning of the engineer, to work unseen; and the
further from him the blow is given, the lesse is he himself su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected.</p>
                  <p>Whosoever plotted, God prevented it, and the Christians
there would have revenged it, but Edward would not suffer
them. In all haste they would have marched and fallen on the
Turks, had not he<note n="*" place="margin">Continuat. Matth. Paris. in <hi>anno</hi> 1272. pag. 1347.</note> disswaded them, because then many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
unarmed, and in small companies, were gone to visit the
Sepulchre, all whose throats had then probably been cut before
their return.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:94789:122"/>Eighteen moneths he stayed at Ptolemais, and then came back
through Italy, without doing any extraordinarie matter in Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine.
What musick can one string make when all the rest are
broken? what could Edward do alone, when those Princes fell
back on whom the project most relied? Lewis and Charles were
the main undertakers; Edward entertained but as an adventurer
and sharer: and so he furnished himself accordingly, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
forces to succour others, but not to subsist of themselves.
But as too often, where the principal miscarrieth, the second and
sureties must lie at the stake to make the debt good: so in their
default he valiantly went forward, though having in all but thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
ships and some thousands of men, (too many for a plain
Prince to visit with, and too few for a great one to warre with)
and performed what lay within the compasse of his power. In a
word, his coming to Ptolemais and assisting them there, was like
a cordiall given to a dying man, which doth piece out his life (or
death rather) a few grones and as many gasps the longers.</p>
                  <p>By this time Henry his aged father being dead (his lamp not
quenched but going out for want of oil) the English Nobilitie
came as farre as the Alpes in Savoy to wait on Edward in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.
Leave we him then to be attended home by them to receive
the Crown, to which no lesse his vertues then birth entitled him.
Since the Conquest he was the first King of his name, and the

that which now possessed all mens thoughts and talk in Syria,

her rich suiters, married this Earl without any portion, onely for
pure love. A preferment beyond his expectation, not above his
deserts: For Germany had many bigger lights, none brighter.
Pope Gregory the tenth would not ratifie his election, but on
this condition, That he should in person march with an armie to
Palestine. And though this was but an old policie, To send the
Emperours far away, that so he might command in chief in their
absence; yet his Holinesse did so turn and dresse this third-bare
plot with specious pretenses of piety, that it passed for new and
fresh, especially to those that beheld it at distance. But Rodul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus
could not be spared out of Germany, being there imployed
in civil discords: The knees of the Dutch Princes were too stiff
to do him homage, till he softned them by degrees. And indeed
he was not provided for the Holy warre, and wanted a stock of
his own to drive so costly a trade, having no paternall lands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
no bottom to begin on; though through his thrift and
providence he first laid the foundation of the Austrian familie.</p>
                  <p>Yet somewhat to answer expectation,<note place="margin">1275</note> he sent Henry Duke of
Mechlenburg with competent forces into Palestine: Who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to Ptolemais, made many notable incursions into the
countrey about Damasco, with fire and sword destroying all as
he went, and carrying thence many rich booties; till at last he
was circumvented &amp; taken prisoner by the Mammalukes. Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
six yeares he lived in captivity, keeping his conscience free all
the while: At last the Sultan of Egypt (a renegado Germane,
who formerly had been engineer to this Dukes father) set him at
liberty, together with Martine his servant; that he who so long
had shared of his miserie, might also partake of his happinesse.
No sooner had this Duke put to sea, but he was again taken by
pirates; and the Sultan, out of pitie to this distressed Prince, and
out of scorn that fortune should frustrate and defeat his reall
courtesie, set him free again. At last he came safely home, and
was there welcomed with asmuch wonder as joy; his subjects
conceiving his return a resurrection, having buried him in their
thoughts long before.</p>
                  <p>Here he found<note n="*" place="margin">Pantal. De illustr. Germ. part. 2. pag. 245.</note> two counterfeits, who pretended themselves

stopped by the Sicilian Vespers; His death,
and sonnes succession.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BY this time Charles King of Jerusalem and Sicily had made
great preparations for the Holy war. And to make his claim
to the Kingdome of Jerusalem the stronger, he bought also the
title of Maria Domicella Princesse of Antioch, which pretended
aright to the same. He sent also Roger the Count of S. Severine
as his Vice-roy to Ptolemais: where he was honourably received
in despite of Hugh King of Cyprus, by the especial favour of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine
Morisine the Venetian Consul there. And now his navie
was reported to be readie, and that by the way he had a project
upon Michael Paleologus the Emperour of Greece: Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all his
intentions were suddenly blasted; it so happening, that on Easter
day, as the bell tolled to Even-song, all the throats of the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in Sicily were cut in a moment by the natives thereof, and
that Island won by Peter King of Aragon. The grand contriver
of this massacre was one Jacobus Prochyta a Physician; and I
dare say he killed more in an houre then he cured all his life-time.</p>
                  <p>Those that condemn the Sicilians herein, cannot excuse the
French; such formerly had been their pride, lust, covetousnesse,
and crueltie to the people of that Island, putting them causelesly
to exquisite torture, so that an ordinary hanging was counted an
extraordinarie favour. But the secrecie of contriving this slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the French was little lesse then miraculous; that so many
knowing it, none should discover it; like cunning dogs, barking in
triumph after they had bitten, not before, to give any warning.
Hence grew the proverb of <hi>the Sicilian Vespers;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1282</note> though their
Even-song was nothing to the English Mattens intended in the
Gunpowder-Treason. Mean time King Charles was at Rome,
beholding the making of Cardinals, when this doleful news was
brought unto him, and struck him to the heart. He survived a year
or two longer, but dull and melancholick, living as it were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
life, and died at last, having reigned King of Jerusalem
twentie year. A Prince which had tasted of various successe;
fortune for a while smiling on him, and at last laughing at him.</p>
                  <p>His son Charles succeded him in the Kingdome of Naples and<note place="margin">1284</note>
in the title of Jerusalem. He was surnamed <hi>Cunctator,</hi> Delayer;
not in the same sense as Fabius the Shield of Rome was so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
he onely stayed till opportunitie was come; our Charles, till
it was passed. I find nothing memorable of him except this, That

offended with the Templars in Palestine for taking part against
him with the King of Cyprus, he seised on their lands, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscated
all their goods they had in Naples or any other part of
his dominions, How ever, let him have room in the catalogue of
our Kings of Jerusalem. For as high hills near the sea-side, though
otherwise never so base and barren ground, yet will serve to be

were vigilant to infest the reliques of the Christians in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine:
Which Princes succession we will adventure to set down;
nor are we discouraged with the difficulties which encounter us
herein. The hardnesse in the story of the Mammalukes proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
(as we conceive) from one of these causes: First the State is
not written directly, but by reflexion; not storied by any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
writer of their own, but in snaps and parcels, as the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niclers,
of neighbouring Christian countreyes have catched at
them. Secondly, out of a popular errour, their chief Captains by
reason of their large authoritie passe for absolute Kings. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the same King hath many names, and the same name by
translation in sundrie languages is strangely disguised. How-ever,
we will use our best conjectures in these uncertainties: and a
dimme candle is better then no light.</p>
                  <p>Bendocdar or Bandodacar, otherwise Melechdaet, was the
last Egyptian Prince we mentioned. A dangerous man to the
Christians, but that Abaga the Tartarian took him to task, and
kept him in continuall imployment. This Abaga had a prettie
trick to make cowards valiant, causing them that ranne away
from the battell, ever after to wear womens clothes. Bendocdar
died at Damascus of a<note n="*" place="margin">Vide Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sium in <hi>anno</hi> 1227. &amp; Magdeburg. Cent. 13.</note> wound he received in Armenia: or, as

                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:94789:124"/>Elpis succeeded him, his<note n="*" place="margin">Magdeburg. Cent. 13. cap. 16. Col. 701.</note> sonne (say some) but the Mamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lukes
laws forbid that except his extraordinary worth was his
facultie, and dispenied with him <hi>ad succedendum patri.</hi> But who
knoweth not that the Eastern tongue speaketh nephewes and
kinsmen to be sonnes? Some wholly omit him; enough to make
us suspect that he was onely some Deputy clapped in to stop up
the vacancie till Melechsaites was chosen.</p>
                  <p>Melechsaites (called by Marinus, Melechmessor) wonne the
strong castle of Mergath from the Hospitallers. He much loved
and was very bountifull to the Carmelites, who lived dispersed
in Syria:<note place="margin">1285</note> but afterwards he banished them out of his countrey,
because they altered their habit, and wore white coats at the
appointment of Pope Honorius; the Turks being generally
enemies to innovations, and loving constancy in old customes.
Nor was this any mishap but an advantage to the Carmelites, to
lose their dwellings in Syria, and gain better in Europe, where
they planted themselves in the fattest places: So that he who
knoweth not to choose good ground, let him find out an house
of the Carmelites (a mark that faileth not) for his direction.</p>
                  <p>Alphir was next to Melechsaites,<note place="margin">1289</note> otherwise called Elsi. He
perceiving that now or never was the time finally to expell the
Christians out of Palestine, whilest the Princes in Europe were
in civil warres, besieged and wonne Tripoli, Sidon, Berytus, and
Tyre, beating them down to the ground, but suffering the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
on some conditions to depart. Nothing now was left
but Ptolemais: which Alphir would not presently besiege, lest
he should draw the Christians in Europe upon him; but conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a peace for five yeares with the Venetians, as not willing
wholly to exasperate them by winning all from them at once,
and thinking this bitter potion would be better swallowed by
them at two severall draughts.</p>
                  <p>Mean time Ptolemais was in a woful condition. In it were some
of all countreys; so that he who had lost his nation, might find it
here. Most of them had severall courts to decide their causes in;
and the plenty of Judges cause<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

was sufficient innocencie for any offender in the Venetian court,
that he was a Venetian. Personall acts were entituled nationall,
and made the cause of the countrie. Outrages were every-where
practised, no-where punished; as if to spare Divine revenge the
pains of overtaking them, they would go forth and meet it. At
the same time, there were in fitters about prosecuting their titles
to this citie, no fewer then the Venetians, Genoans, Pisans, Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines,
the Kings of Cyprus and Sicily, the Agents for the
Kings of France and England, the Princes of Tripoli and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,
the Patriarch of Jerusalem, the Masters of the Templars and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:94789:125"/>
Hospitallers, and (whom I should have named first) the Legate of
his Holinesse, all at once with much violence contending about

and command of this citie; like bees, making the greatest

belike he failed afterwards in his payment to them, the golden

being not payed, according to their blunt manners, would
pay themselves; and marching out, pillaged the countrey, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the truce: Sultan Serapha (who succeeded Alphir) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
restitution, is denied, &amp; his Embassadours ill intreated.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon he sitteth down before the city with six hundred
thousand men.<note place="margin">1290</note> But we are not bound to believe that Alexanders
souldiers were so big as their shields speak them which they left
in India, nor Asian armies so numerous as they are reported. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Turks dominions spacious and populous, and that they
rather drained then chose souldiers; yet we had best credit the
most niggardly writers, which make them an hundred and fiftie
thousand. Serapha resolveth to take it, conceiving so convenient
a purchase could not be over-bought: The place, though not
great, yet was a mote in the eye of the Turkish Empire, and
therefore pained them.</p>
                  <p>Peter Belvise Master of the Templars, a valiant Captain, had
the command of the citie assigned him by generall consent. He
encouraged the Christians to be valiant, not like prodigall heirs
to lose this city for nothing, which cost their grandfathers so
much bloud; at least let them give one blaze of valour ere their
candle went out. How should they shew their friends their faces,
if they shewed their foes their backs! Let them fight it out man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;
that so, if forced at last to surrender it, they might rather be
pitied for want of fortune then justly blamed for lack of valour.</p>
                  <p>And now Ptolemais being to wrastle her last fall, stripped her
self of all combersome clothes: women, children, aged persons,
weak folks (all such hindering help, and mouths without arms)
were sent away; and twelve thousand remained, conceived com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
to make good the place.</p>
                  <p>Serapha marcheth up furiously; his men assault the city, with
open jaws ready to devoure it, had not their mouths been stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
with the artilery the Christians shot at them. Back they
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:94789:125"/>
were beaten, and many a Turk slain. But Serapha was no whit
sensible thereof: who willingly would lose a thousand men in a
morning for a breakfast, double so many at a dinner, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
this costly ordinarie for some daies together; yea, in spite
he would spend an ounce of Turkish bloud, to draw a drop of
Christian.</p>
                  <p>In this conflict Peter Belvise was slain with a poisoned arrow:
A losse above grieving for. Many were strong in desiring the
honour who were weak to discharge the office. But the worst
mischief was; the Christians were divided amongst themselves,
and neglected to defend the citie, conceiving that though that
was taken, yet every particular nation could defend it self, having
their buildings severally fortified: And this dangerous fansie
took off their thoughts from the publick good, and fixed them
on their private ends. Mean time, the Patriarch of Jerusalem,
and others (some name with them Henry King of Jerusalem
and Cyprus) more seeking their safetie then honour, secretly fled
(with their bodies after their hearts) out of the citie; and some of
them shunning a noble death, fell on a base end, being drowned
in the sea. Their cowardlinesse is imputed by some Authours
to all the rest; whereas it appeareth on the contrarie, they most
valiantly behaved themselves.</p>
                  <p>At last,<note place="margin">1291</note> the Turks entred the citie by undermining the walls,
and conceived their work now done, when it was new begun.
For they found Ptolemais not a citie, but a heap of cities thrown
together: wherein the people of every countrey so fensed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their severall sorts, that they powdered the Turks with
their shot when they entred the streets. It is hardly to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leled
in any siege, that a taken citie was so long before it was
taken: for it held out fiftie daies; and the Knights Hospitallers
made good their castle for<note n="*" place="margin">Lampad. Mellif. bist. part. 3. pag. 313.</note> two whole moneths together. But
alas! as the severall parts of <hi>Insecta</hi> being cut asunder, may wrig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
and stirre a while, not live long; so these divided limbes
could not long subsist, and at last most of them were slain.</p>
                  <p>Yet was it a bloudie victorie to the Turks; most of them that
entered the citie being either burned with fire, or killed arrows,
or smothered with the fall of towres, the very ruines (as thirstie
of revenge) killing those that ruined them.</p>
                  <p>Serapha evened all to the ground, and (lest the Christians
should ever after land here) demolished all buildings; the Turks
holding this position, That the best way to be rid of such ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
is to shave the hair clean off, and to destroy all places
wherein they may nestle themselves.</p>
                  <p>Some say he plowed the ground whereon the citie stood, and
sowed it with corn: but an<note n="*" place="margin">Sand. Trav. pag. 204.</note> eye-witnesse affirmeth, that still
there remain magnificent ruines, seeming rather wholy to consist
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:94789:126"/>
of divers conjoyned castles, then any way intermingled with pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
dwellings.</p>
                  <p>No fewer then an hundred thousand Latine Christians (all
that were left in Syria) fled at this time into Cyprus. It is strange
what is reported,<note n="*" place="margin">Lampad. pag. 312.</note> That above five hundred matrones and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
of noble bloud, standing upon the shore of Ptolemais, and
having all their richest jewels with them, cried out with lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
voice, and profered to any mariner that would undertake
safely to land them any where, all their wealth for his hire, and
also that he should choose any one of them for his wife. Then a
certain mariner came, and transporting them all freely, safely
landed them in Cyprus; nor by any enquirie could it after be
known (when he was sought for to receive his hire) who this
mariner was, nor whither he went.</p>
                  <p>The Hospitallers for haste were fain to leave their treasure
behind them, and hide it in a vault; which being made known
from time to time to their successours, was fetched from thence
by the<note n="*" place="margin">Sand. Trav. pag. 204.</note> galleys of Malta about three hundred yeares afterwards.
Henry King of Cyprus to his great cost and greater commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
gave free entertainment to all Pilgrimes that fled hither,
till such time as they could be transported to their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys;
and thanks was all the shot expected of these guests at
their departure.</p>
                  <p>Thus after an hundred ninetie and four yeares ended the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
warre; for continuance the longest, for money spent the cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest,
for bloudshed the cruellest, for pretenses the most pious,
for the true intent the most politick the world ever saw. And at
this day, the Turks to spare the Christians their pains of coming
so long a journey to Palestine, have done them the unwelcome
courtesie, to come more then half the way to give them a
meeting.</p>

What is the present strength of Jerusalem; What hope to regain
it; with some other passages which offer attendance on these
principall heads.</p>
                  <p>Know then, Some nineteen yeares after the Christians had
lost all in Palestine, the Templars, by the cruel deed of Pope
Clement the fifth, and foul fact of Philip the Fair King of
France,<note place="margin">1310</note> were finally<note n="*" place="margin">Sabellicus, Enn. 9. lib. 7. Platina, in vita Clem. <hi>V.</hi>
                     </note> exstirpared out of all Christendome. The
historie thereof is but in twilight, not clearly delivered, but dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
with many doubts and difficulties: We must pick out let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and syllables here and there aswell as we may; all which
put together spell thus much.</p>
                  <p>Pope Clement having long sojourned in France, had received
many reall courtesies from Philip the King; yea, he owed little
lesse then himself to him. At last, Philip requested of him a
boon, great enough for a King to ask and a Pope to grant; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
all the lands of the Knights Templars through France, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:94789:127"/>
by reason of their horrible heresies and licentious living.
The Pope was willing to gratifie him in some good proportion
for his favours received (as thankfulnesse is alwayes the badge
of a good nature) and therefore being thus long the Kings guest,
he gave him the Templars lands and goods to pay for his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</p>
                  <p>On a sudden all the Templars in France they clapt into prison,
wisely catching those Lions in a net, which had they been fairly
hunted to death, would have made their part good with all the
dogs in France. Damnable sinnes were laid to their charge; as,
sacrificing of men to an idol they worshipped, rosting of a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars
bastard and drinking his bloud, spitting upon the crosse of
Christ, conspiring with Turks and Saracens against Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
Sodomie, bestialitie, with many other villanies out of the
rode of humane corruption, and as farre from mans nature as
Gods law.</p>
                  <p>Well; the Templars thus shut in prison, their crimes were
half-proved. The sole witnesse against them was one of their
own Order, a notorious malefactour; who at the same time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in prison and to suffer for his own offenses, condemned by
the Master of their Order, sought to prove his own innocency
by charging all his own Order to be guiltie. And his case stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus, he must either kill or be killed, die or put others to
death, he would be sure to provide water enough to drive the
mill, and fwore most heartily to whatsoever was objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Order. Besides, the Templars being brought upon
the rack, confessed the accusations to be true wherewith they
were charged. Hereupon all the Templars through France were
most cruelly burned to death at a stake, with James the grand
Master of their Order.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Arguments produced on either side, both for the
innocencie and guiltinesse of the Templars.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THere is scarce a harder question in later historie then this,
Whether the Templars justly or unjustly were condemned
to suffer. On the one side, it is dangerous to affirm they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
because condemned by the Pope, infallible in matters
of such consequence. This bugbear affrighteth many, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
their hands shake when they write hereof. If they should
say the Templars were burned wrongfully, they may be fetched
over the coals themselves for charging his Holinesse so deeply;
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:94789:127"/>
yea, hereby they bring so much innocent bloud on the Popes
head as is enough to drown him: Some therefore in this matter
know little,<note place="margin">1310</note> and dare speak lesse, for fear of afterclaps. Secondly,
some who suspect that one eye of the Church may be dimme;
yet hold that both the eyes, the Pope and generall Council to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
cannot be deceived.</p>
                  <p>Now the Council of Vienne countenanced the exstirpation
of the Templars, determined the dissolution of their Order, and
adjudged their lands to be conferred to the Knights-Hospital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.
Men ought then to be well advised how they condemn a
generall Council to be accessorie <hi>post factum</hi> to the murder of so
many men.</p>
                  <p>For all this, those who dare not hollow, do whisper on the
other side, accounting the Templars not malefactours but
martyrs: First, because the witnesse was unsufficient, a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour
against his Judge; and secondly, they bring tortured men
against themselves. Yea, there want not those that maintain
that a confession extorted on the rack is of no validitie, If they
be weak men and unable to endure torment, they will speak
any thing; and in this case their words are endited not from
their heart but outward limbes that are in pain: and a poor
conquest it is, to make either the hand of a child to beate, or
the tongue of the tortured man to accuse himself. If they be
sturdie and stubborn, whose backs are paved against torments,
such as bring brasen sides against steely whips, they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
nothing. And though these Templars were stout and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
men, yet it is to be commended to ones consideration,
whether slavish and servile souls will not better bear torment,
then generous spirits, who are for the enduring of honourable
danger and speedie death, but not provided for torment, which
they are not acquainted with, neither is it the proper object
of valour.</p>
                  <p>Again, it is produced in their behalf, that being burned at the
stake, they denied it at their death, though formerly they had
confessed it; and whose charitie, if not stark-blind, will not
be so tender-eyed as to believe that they would not breath
out their soul with a lie, and wilfully contract a new guilt in
that very instant wherein they were to be arraigned before the
Judge of heaven? A Templar being to be burned at Burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux,
and seeing the Pope and King Philip looking out at a
window, cried unto them,<note n="*" place="margin">Hospin. de orig. Mon. cap. 18. fol. 193.</note> Clement thou cruell Tyrant, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there is no higher amongst mortall men to whom I should
appeal for my unjust death, I cite thee together with King Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip
to the tribunall of Christ the just Judge who redeemed
me, there both to appear within one yeare and a day; where
I will lay open my cause, and justice shall be done without any
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:94789:128"/>
by-respect. In like manner,<note n="*" place="margin">P. Aemylim in Philippo Pulchro.</note> James grand Master of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars,
though by piece-meal he was tortured to death, craved
pardon of God, and those of his Order, that forced by extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
of pain on the rack,<note place="margin">1301</note> and allured with hope of life, he had
accused them of such damnable sinnes, whereof they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the people with their suffrage acquitted them:
happie was he that could get an handfull of their ashes into his
bosome, as the Relique of pious martyrs, to preserve. Indeed
little heed is to be given to peoples humours; whose judgement
is nothing but prejudice and passion, and commonly envie all in
prosperitie, pitie all in adversitie, though often both undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly:
And we may believe that the beholding of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars
torments when they were burned, wrought in the people
first a commiserating of their persons, and so by degrees a justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of their cause. However <hi>vulgus non semper errat, aliquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
elìgit:</hi> and though it matters little for the gales of a private
mans fancie, yet it is something when the wind bloweth from
all corners: And true it is, they were generally cryed up for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, Pope Clement and King Philip were within the time
prefixed summoned by death to answer to God for what they
had done. And though it is bad to be busie with Gods secrets;
yet an argment drawn from the event, especially when it goeth
in company with others, as it is not much to be depended on, so
it is not wholly to be neglected. Besides, King Philip missed of
his expectation, and the morsell fell besides his mouth; for the
lands of the Templars, which were first granted to him as a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for his youngest sonne, were afterwards by the Council of
Vienne bestowed on the Knights-Hospitallers.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>A moderate way what is to be conceived of the
suppression of the Templars.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BEtwixt the two extremities of those that count these Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars
either Malefactours or Martyrs, some find a middle
way; whose verdict we will parcell into these severall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p>1. No doubt there were many novices and punies amongst
them, newly admitted into their Order; which if at all, were
little guiltie; for none can be fledge in wickednesse at their
first hatching: To these much mercy belonged: The punishing
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:94789:128"/>
of others might have been an admonition to them; and crueltie
it was, where there were degrees of offenses, to inflict the same
punishment,<note place="margin">1310</note> and to put all of them to death.</p>
                  <p>2. Surely many of them were most hainous offenders. Not
to speak what they deserved from God (who needeth not pick a
quarrel with man, but alwayes hath a just controversie with
him) they are accounted notorious transgressours of humane
laws: yet perchance if the same candle had been lighted to
search, as much dust and dirt might have been found in other
Orders.</p>
                  <p>3. They are<note n="*" place="margin">Urspergens. Paralip. fol. 368.</note> conceived in generall to be guiltlesse and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
from those damnable sinnes wherewith they were charged:
Which hainous offenses were laid against them,<note place="margin">Antonius; tit. 21. cap. 1. §. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> either because
men out of modestie and holy horrour should be ashamed and
afraid to dive deep in searching the ground-work and bottome
of these accusations, but rather take them to be true on the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of the accusers; or that the world might the more easily be
induced to believe the crimes objected to be true, as conceiving
otherwise none would be so devilish as to lay such devilish of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenses
to their charge; or lastly, if the crimes were not believed
in the totall summe, yet if credited in some competent portion,
the least particular should be enough to do the deed, and to make
them odious in the world.</p>
                  <p>4. The chief cause of their ruine was their extraordinary
wealth: They were feared of many, envied of more, loved of
none. As Naboths vineyard was the chiefest ground for his blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie,
and as in England,<note n="*" place="margin">Camdens Brit. in Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire.</note> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> John Cornwall Lord Fanhop
said merrily, That not he, but his stately house at Ampthill in
Bedford-shire, was guiltie of high treason: so certainly their
welath was the principall evidence against them, and cause of
their overthrow. It is quarrell and cause enough, to bring a sheep
that is fat to the shambles. We may believe King Philip would
never have tooke away their lives if he might have took their
lands without putting them to death: but the mischief was, he
could not get the hony unlesse he burnt the bees.</p>
                  <p>Some will say, The Hospitallers had great, yea greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues,
nineteen thousand Mannors to the Templars nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand;
yet none envied their wealth. It is true: but then they
busied themselves in defending of Christendome, maintaining
the Island of Rhodes against the Turks, as the Teutonick order
defended Pruss-land against the Tartarian; the world there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
never grudged them great wages who did good work. These
were accounted necessary members of Christendome, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars
esteemed but a superfluous wenne; they lay at rack and
manger and did nothing: who had they betook themselves to
any honourable employment, to take the Turks to task either in
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:94789:129"/>
Europe or Asia, their happinesse had been lesse repined at, and
their overthrow more lamented. And certain it is, that this their
idlenesse disposed them for other vices; as standing waters are
most subject to putrifie.</p>
                  <p>I heare one<note n="*" place="margin">Jacob. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus, De jurisdictione, lib. 4. cap. 10. §. 18.</note> bird sing a different note from all the rest in the
wood; namely, that what specious shews soever were pretended,
the true cause of their ruine was, that they began to desert the
Pope and adhere to the Emperour. If this was true, no doubt
they were deeply guiltie, and deserved the hard measure they
suffered. Sure I am, how-ever at this time they might turn edge,
they had formerly been true blades for his Holinesse.</p>
                  <p>All Europe followed the copie that France had set them. Here
in England King Edward the second of that name, suppressed
the Order, and put them to death; So by vertue of a writ sent
from him to Sir John Wogan, Lord chief Justice in Ireland, were
they served there; and such was the secrecie of the contrivance
of the businesse, that the storm fell upon them before they saw
it, and all the crannies were so closely stopped that none could
steal a glimpse of the mischief intended against them.</p>

and appealed to the next Pope who should succeed Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as to his competent judge. Hereupon their lives were spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
onely they were forced to renounce the name of Templars,
and to enter themselves into other Orders; chiefly of Hospital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and Teutonicks, on whom their lands were bestowed. We

and on what conditions they were entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  </argument>
                  <p>FRequent mention hath been formerly made of the Teuto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Order, or that of Dutch Knights, who behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
right valiantly clean through the holy Warre: And,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:94789:129"/>
which foundeth much to their honour, they cannot be touched
either for treason or faction, but were both loyall and peaceable
in the whole service.</p>
                  <p>But at last they perceived, that by the course of the cards they
must needs rise losers if they continued the warre in the Holy
land, and even resolved to abandon it. It happened at the same
time, that Conrade Duke of Mazovia offered them most honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
conditions; namely, the enjoying of Prussia, on condition
they would defend it against the Infidels which annoyed it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the <hi>fratres gladiferi,</hi> or sword-bearing brothers, brave
slashing lads, undertook that task: but finding either their arms
too weak, or swords too blunt to strike through their enemies,
they imployed the aid of, and conjoyned themselves to this
Teutonick Order. Hereupon, in the yeare of our Lord 1239,
Hermannus de Saltza, fourth Master of these Dutch Knights,
came with most of his Order into Prussia; yet so that he left
a competent number of them still in Palestine, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
and did good service there even to the taking of Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais.</p>
                  <p>But the greater number of the Dutch Knights, in Prussia, did
knight-service against the Tartarians, and were Christendomes
best bank against the inundations of those barbarous people. By
their endeavours the Prussians which before were but heathen-Christians,
were wholly converted; many a brave citie builded,
specially Marienburg, where formerly a great oak stood; (who
would think so many beautifull buildings would spring out of
the root of one tree?) and those countreys of Prussia and Livo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
which formerly were the course list, are now become the
rich fringe of Europe.</p>
                  <p>At last the Prussians grew weary of the tyrannous oppression
of those Dutch knights, (as appeareth by the grievances they
presented) and applied themselves to Casimire King of Poland.
He took to task Lewis Erlinfuse the Master of their Order; and
so ordered him, that whereas before he pleaded himself to be a
free Prince of the Empire, hereafter he should acknowledge the
King of Poland for his Lord and Master. The successours to
this Lewis fretted against this agreement, as prejudicial to them:
They could do no lesse then complain, and could do little more;
for the King of Poland in spite of their resistance held them to
their agreements.</p>
                  <p>Albert of the house of Brandenburg was the last grand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of this Order, and first Duke of Prussia. He breake the vow
of their Order, losing his virginitie to keep his chastitie, and
married Dorothie daughter to the King of Denmark. The
other Teutonicks protested against him, and chose Gualther
Croneberg in his roome: Yea, Albert was proscribed in a
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:94789:130"/>
Diet in Germanie, and his goods confiscated, but the proscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
never executed, the Emperour of Germanie being the same
time employed in matters of greater moment which more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerned himself. And thus in this Albert, for ought we can
find to the contrarie, the Teutonick Order had its end, and was
quite dissolved.</p>

from Cyprus, by Rhodes, Nice, Syracuse, to
Malta.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE must now wait on the Hospitallers to their lodgings,
and we have done. We left them driven from Ptolemais,
and landed at Cyprus; where King Henry courteously enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
them. But a friends house is no home: Hence therefore
they were conveyed to their severall Alberges in Europe.</p>
                  <p>But such active spirits could not long be idle; such running
streams would not end in a standing pond. Wherefore they used
all their own strength, and improved their interest with all their
benefactours, to furnish out a fleet: Which done, under Fulk de
Villeret their grand Master they wonne the Island of Rhodes
from the Turks, eighteen yeares after Ptolemais was lost, and
there seated themselves.</p>
                  <p>Besides Rhodes, they also enjoyed these five adjacent Islands,
saith my Authour, Nicoria, Episcopia, Iolli, Limonia, and Sira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;
places so small, that consulting with maps will not find them
out: enough almost to make us think with Tertullian of Delos,
that once there were such Islands, which at this day are quite
vanished away.</p>
                  <p>Two hundred and fourteen yeares, to the terrour of the
Turks, comfort of the Christians, and their own immortall
fame, they maintained this Island, and secured the seas for the
passage of Pilgrimes to Jerusalem: till at last in the yeare 1523,
after six moneths siege they surrendred the citie to their own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and shame of other Christians who sent them no succour
in season.</p>
                  <p>Yet changing their place they kept their resolution to be
honourably imployed. Hence they sailed to Nice in Piemont,
a city lying opposite to Africa, from whence the Moores and
Saracens much infested Christendome. Wherefore Charles
Duke of Savoy bestowed that citie upon them to defend it;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:94789:130"/>
counting the courtesie rather done to him then by him, that they
would accept it.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards, they perceived it was more needfull to stop the
Turks invasions then their pillagings: They had lately wonne
Buda, and (as it was thought) would quickly stride over the Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atick
sea, and have at Italie. Wherefore the Hospitallers left
Nice, and planted themselves at Syracuse in Sicilie: Where
they right valiantly behaved themselves in defending that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
                  <p>But Charles the fifth, a politick Prince, though he saw their
help was usefull, yet desired not much to have them live in his
own countrey. He liked their neighbourhood better then their
presence, to have them rather neare then in his Kingdome.
Wherefore he appointed them the Island of Malta to keep for
themselves, their grand Maister onely paying yearly to the King
of Spain a<note n="*" place="margin">Hospin. De orig. Mon. cap. 17. fol. 190.</note> Falcon in acknowledgement they held it from him.
Loth were the Hospitallers to leave Sicilie, that Paradise of
pleasure, and went very unwillingly from it.</p>
                  <p>Malta is an Island in the mid-land-sea, seated betwixt Europe
and Africa, as if it meant to escape out of both as being in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Here S. Paul suffered shipwrack, when the viper stung
him not, but the men did,<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 28. 4.</note> condemning him for a murderer.
And here the Hospitallers seated themselves, and are the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark
of Christendome to this day, giving dayly evident proof
of their courage. But their master-piece was in the yeare 1565,
when they couragiously defended the city of Malta besieged by
Soliman: When he discharged seventie eight thousand bullets
(some of them seven spans in compasse) against it, big enough
not onely to overthrow walls but overturn mountains; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
they held out valiantly five moneths, and at last
forced the Turk to depart.</p>
                  <p>These Knights of Malta are at this day a good bridle to Tunis
and Algiers. I am informed by a good<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. Gr. Gibs of S. Perrot, Dorset.</note> friend (who hath spent
much yet lost no time in those parts) that these Knights are
bound by vow not to flie from the Turks, though one man or
one galley to foure (half which ods Hercules himself durst not
venture on;) but if there be five to one, it is interpreted wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
not cowardlinesse, to make away from them: Also if a
Christian ship wherein there is a Knight of Malta take a Turkish
ship, that Knight is bound by his Order first to go aboard to
enter it. The grand Master of this Order hath a great command,
and is highly esteemed of; insomuch that the<note n="*" place="margin">Cassanaem. part. 9. consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat. 4.</note> Authour of

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Hospitallers in England stoutly withstand
three severall assaults, which overthrew all
other Religious foundations.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe suppression of the Hospitallers in England deserveth
especiall notice, because the manner thereof was different
from the dissolving of other Religious houses; for manfully
they stood it out to the last, in despite of severall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults.</p>
                  <p>1. Cardinall Wolsey, by leave from the Pope, suppressed
certain small houses of little value, therewithall to endow his
Colledges in Oxford and Ipswich. He first shewed Religious
places were mortall, which hitherto had flourished in a seeming
eternitie. This leading case of Wolseys did pick the motter out
of all the Abbeys-walls in England, and made a breach in their
strongest gate-houses, teaching covetousnesse (an apt scholar)
a ready way to assault them: (For it is the dedication, not the
value of the thing dedicated, stampeth a character of sacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
upon it.) And King Henry the eighth concluded, if the
Cardinall might eat up the lean Covents, he himself might
feed on the far ones, without danger of a sacrilegious surfet.
True it is, Wolsey not wholly but in part alienated the
lands of these pettie houses, reserving them still to the
generall end of pious uses: But the King followed this pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
so farre as it was for his purpose, and neglected the
rest.</p>
                  <p>2. For not long after, the<note n="*" place="margin">Statut. in 27<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Henr. viii.</note> Parliament granted him all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
houses of and under the value of two hundred pounds
yearly: and it was thought, that above ten thousand persons,
masters and servants, lost their livelihoods by the demolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them. And for an introduction to the suppression of all
the residue, he had a strait watch set upon them, and the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
therein tied to a strict and punctuall observation of their
orders, without any relaxation of the least libertie; insomuch
that many did quickly un-nunne and disfriar themselves, whose
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:94789:132"/>
sides formerly used to goe loose, were soon galled with strait
lacing.</p>
                  <p>3. Then followed the grand dissolution or judgement-day
on the world of Abbeys remaining; which of what value so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
were seised into the Kings hands. The Lord Cromwell,
one of excellent parts but mean parentage, came from the forge
to be the hammer to maul all Abbeys. Whose magnificent
ruines may lesson the beholders, That it is not the firmnesse of
the stone nor fastnesse of the morter maketh strong walls, but the
integritie of the inhabitants. For indeed foul matters were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
against some of them, as Sodomie and much uncleannesse:
Whereupon unwillingly willing, they resigned their goods and
persons to the Kings mercie. But the Knights-Hospitallers
(whose chief mansion was at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Johns, nigh London) being
Gentlemen and souldiers of ancient families and high spirits,
would not be brought to present the King such puling petitions
and publick recognitions of their errours as other Orders had
done. They complained it was a false consequence, as farre
from charitie as logick, from the induction of some particular
delinquents to inferre the guiltinesse of all Religious persons.
Wherefore like stout fellows they opposed any that thought to
enrich themselves with their ample revenues, and stood on their
own defense and justification.</p>

                  <p>BUt Barnabe's day it self hath a night; and this long-lived

                  <p>They were suffered to have rope enough, till they had halter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

to the<note n="*" place="margin">Parlam. Anno 320. Henr. viii.</note> Pope, contrary to their allegiance, whose usurped
authoritie was banished out of the land; and so (though their
lives otherwise could not be impeached for any vitiousnesse.)
they were brought within the compasse of the law. The
case thus standing, their deare friends perswaded them to
submit to the Kings mercie, and not to capitulate with him
on conditions, nor to stop his favour by their own obstinacie,
but yield whilest as yet terms honest and honourable, would
be freely given them: That such was the irresistiblenesse of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:94789:133"/>
the Kings spirit, that like a torrent it would bear down any thing
which stood betwixt him and his desires; If his anger were
once inflamed, nothing but their bloud could quench it: Let
them not flatter themselves into their own ruine, by relying
on the aid of their friends at home, who would not substitute
their own necks to save theirs from the ax; nor by hoping for
help from forrein parts, who could send them no seasonable
succour.</p>
                  <p>This counsell harsh at first, grew tunable in the eares of the
Hospitallers; so that contented rather to exchange their clothes
for worse then to be quite stript, they resigned all into the Kings
hands. He allowed to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> William Weston Lord Prior of the
Order, an annuall pension of one thousand pounds: But he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
never a penny thereof, but died<note n="*" place="margin">Weaver, Mon. pag. 114.</note> instantly, struck to the
heart when he first heard of the dissolution of his Priory:<note place="margin">1540 May 7'</note> and
lieth buried in the Chancell of Clarkenwell, with the portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a dead man lying on his shroud, the most artificially cut

to their severall qualities and deserts.</p>
                  <p>At the same time justs and tornaments were held at Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster:
wherein the challengers against all comers, were S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> John

Carew, Knights; Anthonie Kingstone, and Richard Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
Esquires; To each of whom for reward of their valour,
the King gave a hundred markes of yearely revenues, and a
house to dwell in, to them and their heires, out of the lands
belonging to these Hospitallers. And at this time, many had
Danae's happinesse, to have golden showres rained into their
bosomes.</p>
                  <p>These Abbey-lands, though skittish mares to some, have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
good milk to others: Which is produced as an argument,
That if they prove unsuccessefull to any, it is the users default,
no inherencie of a curse in the things themselves. But let one
keep an exact Register of lands, and mark their motions, how
they ebbe and flow betwixt buyers and sellers, and surely he

                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:94789:133"/>Thus as chirurgeons in cutting off a gangrened leg, alwayes
cut it off above the joynt, even where the flesh is whole and
sound: so (belike for fear of further infection) to banish Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerie
for ever, they rased the structures and harmlesse build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Priories, which otherwise in themselves were void of
any offence. They feared if Abbeys were onely left in a swound,
the Pope would soon get hot water to recover them: To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
which, they killed them and killed them again, overturning
the very foundation of the houses, infringing, altering, and
transferring the lands, that they might never be reduced to
their own propertie. Some outrages were committed in the
manner of these dissolutions: Many manuscripts, guilty of no
other superstition then red letters in the front, were condemned
to the fire: and here a principall key of antiquitie was lost, to the
great prejudice of posteritie. But in sudden alterations it is not
to be expected that all things be done by the square and

<note n="*" place="margin">Parlam. Anno 2<hi rend="sup">•</hi> &amp; 3<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Phil. &amp; Mariae.</note> frankly restored, resigned, and confirmed by Parliament all

they were loth therefore to emptie their veins again; and the

                     <p>Observations on the Holy warre; The horrible
superstition therein.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE have finished the story of the Holy warre: And now I
conceive my indentures are cancelled, and I discharged
from the strict service and ties of an Historian; so that it may be
lawfull for me to take more libertie, and to make some observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
on what hath been past.</p>
                  <p>Before I go further, I must deplore the worlds losse of that
worthy work which the Lord Verulam left unfinished, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Holy warre; an excellent piece, and alas! it is but
a piece: so that in a pardonable discontent we may almost wish
that either it had been more, wholly to have satisfied our
hunger, or lesse, not at all to have raised our appetite. It was
begun not in an historicall but in a politick way, not reporting
the Holy warre past with the Turks but advising how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
it in the future. And no doubt if he had perfected the work,
it would have proved worthy the Authour: But since, any have
been deterred from finishing the same; as ashamed to add mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walls
and a thatched roof to so fair a foundation of hewen and
polished stone.</p>
                  <p>From that Authour we may borrow this distinction, That
three things are necessary to make an invasive warre lawfull;
the lawfullnesse of the jurisdiction, the merit of the cause,
and the orderly and lawfull prosecution of the cause. Let
us apply it to our present purpose in this Holy warre: For the
first two, Whether the jurisdiction the Christians pretended
over the Turks dominions was lawfull or not; and, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this warre was not onely <hi>operae</hi> but <hi>vitae pretium,</hi> worth
the losing so many lives; we referre the reader to what
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:94789:134"/>
hath been said in the<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 9. and 10.</note> first Book. Onely it will not be
amisse, to adde a storie or two out of an<note n="*" place="margin">Froissard, lib. 4. cap. 18, 19.</note> Authour of good
account. When Charles the sixth was King of France, the
Duke of Bourbon sailed over into Africa with a great armie,
there to fight against the Saracens. The Saracen Prince sent
an herald to know of him the cause of his coming: The Duke
answered, it was to revenge the death of Christ the Sonne of
God, and true Prophet, whom they had unjustly crucified.
The Saracens sent back again their messenger to demonstrate
their innocencie, how they were not Saracens but Jews which
put Christ to death, and therefore that the Christians (if
posteritie should be punished for their predecessours fault)
should rather revenge themselves on the Jews which lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Monstrell. lib. 3. cap. 68.</note> Another relateth, that in the yeare of our Lord 1453, the
great Turk sent a letter to the Pope, advertising him how he and
his Turkish nations were not descended from the Jews, but from
the Trojans, from whom also the Italians derive their pedegree,
and so would prove himself a kinne to his Holinesse. Moreover
he added, that it was both his and their dutie to repair the ruines
of Troy, and to revenge the death of their great grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
Hector upon the Grecians; to which end, the Turk
said he had already conquered a great part of Greece. As
for Christ, he acknowledged him to have been a noble
Prophet, and to have been crucified of the Jews, against
whom the Christians might seek their remedie. These two
stories I thought good to insert, because though of later date,
and since the Holy warre in Palestine was ended, yet they have
some reference thereunto, because some make that our quarrel
to the Turks.</p>
                  <p>But grant the Christians right to the Turks lands to be lawfull,
and the cause in it self enough deserving to ground a warre upon:
yet in the prosecuting and managing thereof, many not onely ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
errours but unexcusable faults were committed; no doubt,
the cause of the ill successe.</p>
                  <p>To omit the book called the Office of our Lady, made at
the beginning of this warre to procure her favourable assistance
in it, (a little manual, but full of blasphemies in <hi>folio,</hi> thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her with importunate superstitions into Gods throne, and
forcing on her the Glory of her maker;) superstition not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tainted the rind, but rotted the core of this whole action.
Indeed most of the pottage of that age tasted of that wild
gourd. Yet farre be it from us to condemn all their works to
be drosse, because debased and allayed with superstitious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents:
No doubt there was a mixture of much good metall in
them, which God the good refiner knoweth how to sever, and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:94789:135"/>
then will crown and reward. But here we must distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
those deeds which have some superstition in them, and
those which in their nature are wholly superstitious, such as this
Voyage of people to Palestine was. For what opinion had they
of themselves herein, who thought that by dying in this warre,
they did make Christ amends for his death? as one saith:
Which if but a rhetoricall flourish, yet doth hyperbolize into
blasphemie. Yea, it was their very judgement, that hereby they
did both merit and supererogate; and by dying for the Crosse,
crosse the score of their owne sinnes, and score up God for
their debtour. But this flieth high, and therefore we leave it
for others to follow. Let us look upon Pilgrimages in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
and we shall finde Pilgrimes wandring not so farre
from their own countrey as from the judgement of the ancient
Fathers.</p>
                  <p>Wee will leave our armie at home, and onely bring forth
our champion: Heare what<note n="*" place="margin">Epist. seu Orat. de iis qui adeunt Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sol. Edit. Gr. Lat. Parisils, 1615.</note> Gregorie Nyssene saith, who
lived in the fourth Centurie, in which time voluntary Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
first began; though before there were necessary Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes,
forced to wander from their countrey by persecution.
Where, saith hee, our Lord pronounceth men blessed, hee
reckoneth not going to Jerusalem to be amongst those good
deeds which direct to happinesse. And afterwards, speaking
of the going of single-women in those long travels; A woman,
saith he, cannot go such long journeys without a man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
her; and then whatsoever we may suppose, whether shee
hireth a stranger or hath a friend to waite on her, on neither
side can shee escape reproof, and keep the law of continencie.
Moreover; If there were more Divine grace in the places of

thefts, idolatrie, poysonings, envies and slaughters.
But you will say unto me, If it be not worth the paines, why
then did you goe to Jerusalem? Let them heare therefore how
I defend my self; I was appointed to goe into Arabia to an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Councel, held for the reforming of that Church: and Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia
being neare to Jerusalem, I promised those that went with
me, that I would go to Jerusalem to discourse with them which
were presidents of the Churches there; where matters were
in a very troubled state, and they wanted one to be a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
in their discords. We knew that Christ was a man born
of a Virgin, before wee saw Bethlehem; wee believed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
from death, before we saw his sepulchre; we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
his ascension into heaven, before we saw mount Olivet:

I pray, what was Peter, the leader of this long dance, but an

dungeon of the Monasticall prison, the strictest and severest of
all other Orders. And though there were not so many cowls

constantly flow: Which liquour the Templars carried home to
their houses, and distributed it to the Pilgrimes which came to

                  <p>Infinite are the sholes of miracles done by Christs Crosse in
Jerusalem; insomuch that my<note n="*" place="margin">Roger Hove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, in anno 1187.</note> Authour blamed the Bishop of
Acon, who carried the Crosse in that battel wherein it was lost
to the Turks, for wearing a corselet; and therefore (saith he) he
was justly slain: because his weak faith relied on meanes, not on
the miraculous protection thereof.</p>

their secret sinnes.</p>
                  <p>But the last miracle of our Lady in Palestine is the Lady of all
miracles; which was this: In the yeare 1291, when the Holy
land was finally subdued by the Turks, the chamber at Nazareth
wherein the Angel Gabriel saluted her with joyfull tydings, was
wonderfully<note n="*" place="margin">Spondanus, in anno 1291.</note> transported into Sclavonia. That countrey being
unworthy of her divine presence, it was by the Angels carried
over into Italie, <hi>anno</hi> 1294. That place also being infested with
thieves and pirates, the Angels removed it to the little village
of Loretto; where this Pilgrime-Chappel resteth it selfe at
this day, and liketh her entertainment so well, it will travel no
further.</p>
                  <p>But enough: for fools meat is unsavourie to the taste of the

(as Noah preserved but two of all unclean creatures) the
rest might be lost without losse, and safely be drowned in obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion.
How-ever, we may observe these millions of miracles are
reducible to one of these foure ranks:</p>
                  <p>1. Falsely reported, never so much as seemingly done. Asia
the theatre whereon they were acted, is at a great distance, and
the miracles as farre from truth, as the place from us. And
who knoweth not, when a lie is once set on foot, besides the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:94789:136"/>
first founders, it meeteth with many benefactours, who contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
their charitie thereunto.</p>
                  <p>2. Falsely done; insomuch as at this day, they are<note n="*" place="margin">Miraeula, si pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> sented
amongst the Romanists. Who would not laugh to see the picture
of a Saint weep? Where one devout Catholick lifteth up his
eyes, ten of their wiser sort wag their heads.</p>
                  <p>3. Truly done, but by the strength of nature. Suppose one
desperately sick, a piece of the Crosse is applied to him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth;
is this a miracle? Nothing lesse; how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
have made an escape after Death in a manner hath arrested
them? As therefore it is sacriledge, to father Gods immediate
works on naturall causes; so it is superstition, to intitle naturall
events to be miraculous.</p>
                  <p>4. Many miracles were ascribed to Saints which were
done by Satan. I know it will <hi>non-plus</hi> his power to worke a
true miracle; but I take the word at large: and indeed vulgar
(not to say, humane) eyes are too dimme to discern betwixt
things wonderfull and truly miraculous. Now Satan, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-juggler
needeth no wires or ginnes to worke with, being
all ginnes himselfe; so transcendent is the activitie of a spirit.
Nay, may not God give the Devil leave to goe beyond him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
it being just with him, that those who will not have
Truth their king and willingly obey it, should have Falshood
their tyrant to whom their judgement should be captivated and
inslaved.</p>

                     <p>The second grand errour in prosecuting the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
warre, being the Christians notorious breaking
their faith with Infidels.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>NExt unto Superstition, which was deeply inlayed in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
warre, we may make the Christians Truce-breaking with
the Infidels the second cause of their ill successe. Yet never
but once did they breake promise with the Turks; which was
(as I may say) a constant and continued faith-breaking, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
keeping their word. To omit severall straining of the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes
and unjoynting the bones of many a solemne peace, we
will onely instance where the neck thereof was clearly broken
asunder.</p>
                  <p>1. When Godfrey first won Jerusalem, pardon was proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to all the Turks which yielded themselves; yet three dayes
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:94789:137"/>
after in cold bloud, they were all, without difference of age or
sex, put to the sword.</p>
                  <p>2. Almerick the First swore, effectually to assist the Saracens
in driving the Turks out of Egypt; and soon after invaded E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
and warred upon the Turks against his promise. I know
something he pretended herein to defend himself, but of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liditie;
and such plausible and curious wittie evasions to avoid
perjurie, are but the tying of a most artificiall knot in the halter,
therewith to strangle ones own conscience.</p>
                  <p>3. There was a peace concluded for some time betwixt
King Guy and Saladine; which <hi>non obstante,</hi> Reinold of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile
robbed Saladines own mother: Whereupon followed the
miserable overthrow of the Christians, and taking of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</p>
                  <p>4. Our Richard, at his departure from Palestine, made a firm
peace for five yeares with Saladine, and it stood yet in force
when Henry Duke of Saxonie coming with a great armie of new
adventurers invaded the Turkish dominions.</p>
                  <p>5. Frederick the Second, Emperour, made a truce of ten
yeares with the Sultan of Babylon; and yet in despite thereof,
Theobald King of Navarre forraged the countrey of Gaza, to
the just overthrow of him and his armie.</p>
                  <p>6. Reinold Vice-roy of Palestine, in the name of Frederick
the Emperour, and after him our Richard Earl of Cornwall,
drew up a firm peace with the said Sultan; which was instantly
disturbed and interrupted by the turbulent Templars.</p>
                  <p>7. Lastly, the Venetians, in the name of all Christian Princes,
concluded a five yeares peace with Alphir the Mammaluke
Prince of Egypt; yet some voluntaries in Ptolemais pillaged
and robbed many Saracen merchants about the citie. But pardon
them this last fault, we will promise they shall never do so any
more in Palestine, hereupon losing all they had left there.</p>
                  <p>And how could Safetie it selfe save this people, and blesse
this project so blackly blasted with perjury! As it is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of tyrants, Where one goeth, ten are sent to the grave; so
where one truce concluded with the Turks did naturally expire
and determine, many were violently broken off. A sinne so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to all moral honestie, so injurious to the quiet and peace
of the world, so odious in it selfe, so scandalous to all men, To
dissolve a league when confirmed by Oath (the strongest bond
of conscience, the end of particular strife, the souldier of publick
peace, the sole assurance of amitie betwixt divers nations, made
here below, but inrolled in his high court whose glorious name
doth sign it;) a sinne, I say, so hainous, that God cannot but must
severely punish it. David asketh,<note place="margin">Psal. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Who shall dwell upon thy holy

and disappointeth him not, though it were to his own hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance.</hi>
No wonder then, though the Christians had no longer
abidance in the Holy hill of Palestine (though this, I confesse, is
but the bark-of the text) driving that trade wherewith none ever
thrived, the breaking of promises: Wherewith one may for a
while fairly spread his train, but he will moult his feathers
soon after.</p>

                     <p>Of the hindrances of the good successe in the
Holy warre; whereof the Popes, and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours

                  </argument>
                  <p>SO much concerning those <hi>laesa principia</hi> in this Holy warre,
Superstition and Perjurie, which struck at the root of it.
Come we now to consider many other hindrances, which abated
the good successe thereof. Amongst these we will not be so he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical
as to deny the Popes Primacie; but account him the first
cause of their ill success. Such wounds as we finde in his credit,
we will neither widen nor close up; but even present them to the
Reader as we found them. In foure respects he baned the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
good speed in this warre:</p>
                  <p>1. He caused most of their truce-breaking with the Turks,
urging men thereunto. Thus Pope Celestine drove on the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
against the Turks, whilest as yet the peace our Richard
concluded with them was not expired; and so many other times
also. For alas! this was nothing with his Holinesse; who sitting
in the temple of God, so farre advanceth himself above God, as
to dispense with oathes made sacred by the most holy and high
name of God; and professing himselfe the sole Umpire and
Peace-maker of the world, doth cut asunder those onely sinews
which hold peace together.</p>
                  <p>2. In that twice the Kingdome of Jerusalem was offered to
the Christians, and the Popes Legates would not suffer them
to accept it: (No doubt, by instructions from their Master;
this being to be presumed on, That those his absolute creatures
altered not a tittle, but went according to the copie that was
set them) Once <hi>anno</hi> 1219; when Pelagius the Legate refused
the free offer of Melechsala: And the second time, some thirtie
yeares after; when the same bountifull profer was refused by
Odo the Popes Legate: For when the same Melechsala againe
offered the free resignation of the whole Kingdome of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:94789:138"/>
whereby the same day great quietnesse had entered into all
Christendome, with the end of much bloudshed and miserie;
the Legate<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>frontosè contradioens,</hi> would in no wise receive the
conditions offered.</p>
                  <p>3. Frederick the second, Emperour, was possessed of it;
when the Pope molested him, and stirred up the Templars
against him, as so many needles to prick him when he was to sit
down on the throne.</p>
                  <p>4. By diverting the Pilgrimes, and over-titling his own quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
to be Gods cause; nothing being more common with him,
then to employ those armies which were levied for the Holy
warre, in subduing the Albingenses and many other of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
enemies.</p>
                  <p>By all these it plainly appeareth, That what fair shews
soever his Holinesse made, calling Councils, appointing Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates,
providing preachers, proclaiming pardons, to advance
this warre; yet in very deed, he neither intended nor desired
that the Christians should make a finall conquest of Palestine,
but be imployed in continuall conquering it. He would have
this warre go on <hi>cum decente pausa,</hi> fair and softly: let the
Christians now beat the Turks, and then the Turks beat the
Christians; and so let them take their turns, whilest his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
profit went on. For (as we touched before) to this warre
the Pope condemned all dangerous persons (especially the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
of Germanie) to be there imployed. As little children
are often set to school, not so much to learn, as to keep them
out of harmes way at home: so this carefull Father sent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his children to the Holy warre, not for any good he
knew they would either do or get there, but it would keep
them from worse doing; which otherwise would have been
paddling in this puddle, raking in that channel, stirring up que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
and controversies unfavourie in the nostrils of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and perchance falling into the fire of discord and dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
against their own Father. Indeed at last this warre ended
it self in despite of the Pope: Who no doubt would have
driven this web (weaving and unweaving it, Penelope-like)
much longer if he could: yet he digested more patiently the
ending thereof, because the net might be taken away when the
fish was already caught, and the warre spared now the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Emperours strength thereby was sufficiently abated in
Italie.</p>
                  <p>Much also this warre increased the <hi>intrado</hi> of the Popes
revenues. Some say, Purgatory-fire heateth his kitchen: they
may adde, the Holy warre filled his pot, if not paid for all
his second course. It is land enough, to have the office of
collecting the contributions of all Christendome given to this
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:94789:138"/>
warre. So much for his great receits hereby. And as for what
he expended, not too farre in the point. If the Pope (saith

say to him, Why dost thou so? It is presumption then to make
him answer for money, who is not accountable for men.</p>
                  <p>With the Pope let the Emperours of Greece their Jealousie
go, as the second bane of the Christians successe in this warre.
These Emperours tormented themselves in seeking that they
would have been loth to find, the treacherie of the Latines; and
therefore to begin first, used them with all treacherie: Whereof,
largely<note n="*" place="margin">Book 2. chap. 9, 27.</note> formerly. And surely, though a cautious circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be commendable in Princes; yet in such over-fear, they
were no lesse injurious to themselves then to the western Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes.
Yea generally, suspiciousnesse is as great an enemy to

                  </argument>
                  <p>THe next cause of their ill successe was the discord arising
from the paritie of the Princes which undertook this voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.
Many of them could abide no equall; all no superiour: so
that they had no chief, or rather were all chiefs; The swarm
wanted a master-Bee, a supreme commander, who should aw
them all into obedience. The Germane Emperour (though
above all) came but seldome, and was not constant amongst
them: The King of Jerusalem (especially in the declining of
the State) was rather slighted then feared: The Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
usurped a superioritie, but was never willingly nor ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
obeyed. Surely smaller forces being united under one
command would have been more effectuall in proof (though
not so promising in opinion and fame) then these great armies
variously compounded by associations and leagues, and of the
confluence of Princes otherwise unconcurring in their severall
courses.</p>
                  <p>Livie writing of that great battel (the criticall day of the

he, to speake of, yet of much moment in the matter itself, that
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:94789:139"/>
when the armies joyned, the shouting of the Romanes was farre
more great and terrible, as being all of one voice from the same
nation; whilest Hannibals souldiers voices were different and
disagreeing, as consisting of severall languages. If such a toy be
considerable, and differing in tongues lesseneth the terriblenese
in an armie; how doth dissenting in hearts and affections abate
the force thereof? and what advantage had the united Turks
against divided Christian Princes which managed this warre?
Had the emulation betwixt those equall Princes onely been such
as is the spurre of vertue, farre from enmitie and hatefull conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
striving with good deserts to outstrip those who by the
same means sought to attain to the like end; had it been mixed
with love in regard of the affinitie of their affections and sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of their desires, not seeking the ruine of their competitour
but succouring him in danger; then such <hi>simultates</hi> had been both
honourable and usefull to the advantage of the Holy cause: But
on the other side, their affections were so violent, and disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
so crooked, that emulation in them boyled to harred,
that to malice, which rested better satisfied with the miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
end of their opposite partner, then with any tropheys de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly

There needed no other hindrance to this voyage then
the voyage; the way was so long. In sensation, the object must
not be over-distant from the sense; otherwise Lynceus eyes
may see nothing: So it is requisite in warlike adventures, that
the work be not too farre from the undertakers. Indeed the
Romanes conquered countreys farre from home: but the lands
betwixt them were their own, wherein they refreshed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and well may one lift a great weight at armes end if
he hath a rest to stay his elbow on. So though Spain hath sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
much in the Indies, yet there they met with none or naked
resistance. It fared not thus with the Christians in this warre:
By the tediousness of their journey their strength was exhausted;
they ranne dregs when first they were broched in Syria, and as it
were scattered their powder in presenting, before they came to
discharge.</p>
                  <p>Frederick Barbarossa wrote a braving letter to Saladine,
reckoning up the severall nations in Europe under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and boasting what an army of them he would bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Syria.<note n="*" place="margin">M. Paris. pag. 197.</note> Saladine answered him, That he also ruled over as
many peoples, and told him, that there was no sea which
hindred his men from coming quickly together; whereas
saith he, you have a great sea, over which with pains and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:94789:139"/>
you must passe before you can bring your men hither.
Besides, if the Christians shaped their journey by land, then
their miseries in Hungarie, Grecia, and Asia the lesse, made
their land-journey more tedious and troublesome, then if they
had gone by sea.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THat Prelates and Clergie-men were often Generalls in this
action (as Peter the Hermite, Pelagius the Cardinall, and
many others) was another cause of their ill successe: For allow
them able in their own way, for matter of learning, yet were
they unsufficient to manage martiall affairs. Many who in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
have learned the French tongue, aud afterwards have gone
over into France, have found themselves both deaf and dumbe
in effect, neither hearing to understand, nor speaking to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood:
They in like manner, who frame themselves in their
studies a model of leading an armie, find it as full of errours as
rules, when it cometh to be applied; and a measure of warre
taken by book, falleth out either too long or too short, when
brought into the field to be used.</p>
                  <p>I have heard a storie of a great map-monger, who undertook
to travel over England by help of his maps, without asking the
least direction of any he met. Long he had not ridden but he
met with a <hi>non plus ultra,</hi> a deep unpassable gullet of water,
without bridge, ford, or ferry. This water was as unknown to
his Camdens or Speeds maps, as to himself; because it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
body nor branch of any constant river or brook, (such as
onely are visible in maps) but an <hi>ex-tempore-</hi> water, flowing
from the snow which melted on hills. Worse unexpected acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
surprise those who conceive themselves to have conned all
martiall maximes out of Authours, and warrant their skill in
warre against all events, out of their great reading; when on the
sudden some unwonted occurrent taketh them unprovided, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
amazed till destruction seiseth on them.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, sometimes such unlooked-for chances arrest even
the best and most experienced Generalls, which have long
been acquainted with warre; nor are they priviledged by all
their experience from such casualties, nor are they so omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
but that their skill might be posed therewith, a minute
shewing sometimes what an age hath not seen before: But
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:94789:140"/>
then such aged commanders have this advantage, that finding
themselves at a fault, they can soonest know where to beat about
and recover it.</p>
                  <p>Adde to the inabilitie, the incongruitie of Prelates going to
sight. True, in defensive warres necessitie is their sufficient dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation;
but otherwise it is improper. In the battel against
Amalck, Josua fought; Moses prayed; the Levites bare the ark,
no office of command in the Camp. And better it had been
that Cardinall Columna had been at his beads, or in his bed,
or any where else, then in the camp in Egypt; where by his
indiscreet counsel he brought all the lives of the Christians
into danger.</p>

And what weakneth Northern men going

                  </argument>
                  <p>NOw followeth the Diversitie of the climate, which caused
the death of many thousands of the Christians, sweeping
them away with horrible plagues and other diseases. For even
as men when they come into a new Corporation, must pay their
fees before they can be freemen thereof and set up trading there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
so it alwayes cost the Christians of Europe a dangerous sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
at least, before they could be well acquainted with the aire
and climate of Palestine.</p>
                  <p>Amongst other diseases the Leprosie was one epidemicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
which tainted the Pilgrimes coming thither. This
(though most rise in our Saviours time, God so ordering it that
Judea was sickest while her Physician was nearest) at this time of
the Holy warre was very dangerous. Hence was it brought over
into England (never before known in this Island) and many
Lazar-houses erected for the relief of those infected therewith:
Their chief houses was at Burton-lazars in Leceister-shire. I say
not, as this disease began with the Holy warre in England, so it
ended with it: Sure such hath been Gods goodnesse, that few at
this day are afflicted therewith; and the leprosie of Leprosie, I
mean the contagion thereof, in this cold countrey is much
abated.</p>
                  <p>Many other sicknesses seised on the Pilgrimes there, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in summer. The Turks, like Salamanders, could live in that
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:94789:140"/>
fiery countrey, whose scorching our Northern bodies could not
endure. Yea, long before I find it observed by Vitruvius, that
they who come cold into hot countreys, cannot long subsist,
but are dissolved; whilest those that change out of hot into cold,
find not onely no distemper and sicknesse by the alteration, but
also grow more healthfull, solid, and compacted: But this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
is easilyer said then maintained.</p>
                  <p>But let us not hereupon be disheartened to set on our Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
foes for fear to be impaired, nor they invited to invade us
by hope to be improved. Know, it is not so much the climate,
as bad and unwholesome diet inraging the climate against us,
which unfineweth those Northern nations when they come into
the South: which bad diet, though sometimes necessary for
want of better food, yet is most-times voluntary through mens
wilfull intemperance. In the Portugall action <hi>anno</hi> 1589, more
English owed their Calenture to the heat of wine then weather.
Why do our English merchants bodies sadge well enough in
Southern aire? why cannot our valour thrive as well there as our
profit; but chiefly for this, That merchants are carefull of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
whilest souldiers count it basenesse to be thristie of their
own healths?</p>
                  <p>Besides, the sinnes of the South unmasculine Northern bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
In hot countreys the Sirens of pleasure sing the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
which quickly ravish our eares unused to such musick. But
should we marching Southwards observe our health in some
proportion of temperance, and by degrees habituate ourselves
to the climate; and should we keep ourselves from their sinnes,
no doubt the North might pierce the South as farre, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
erect as high and long-lasting tropheys, as ever the South did
in the North.</p>
                  <p>Nor must it have admittance without examination into a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
breast, what some have observed; That Northern people
never enjoyed any durable settled government in the South.
Experience avoweth they are more happie in speedy conquering
then in long enjoying of countreys.</p>
                  <p>But the first Monarch the world ever knew (I mean, the
Assyrian) came from the North: Whence he is often styled in
Scripture, The King of the North; conquering, and for many
yeares enjoying those countreys which lie betwixt him and the
sunne; as Chaldea, Mesopotamia, Babylonia, Syria, Egypt: To
speak nothing of the Turks, who in the dichotomizing of the
world fall under the Northern part, and coming out of Scythia
at first subdued most Southern countreys.</p>

                  <p>THus are we fallen on the next hindrance of successe in this
Holy warre, the Vitiousnesse of the undertakers. But here
first we must make an honourable reservation for many adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers
herein, whom we confesse most pious and religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
Let us not raise the opinion of our own piety by trampling
on our predecessours, as if this age had monopolized all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to it self. Some no doubt most religious and truly valiant
(as fearing nothing but sinne) engaged themselves in this action;
of whom I could onely wish, that their zeal herein had either
had more light or lesse heat. But with these, I say not how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but too many went most wicked people, the causers of the
ill successe.</p>
                  <p>It will be objected, <hi>Sanctitas morum</hi> hath been made of some
a note of the true Church, never the signe of a fortunate ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie:
Look on all armies generally, we shall find them of the
souldiers religion, not troubled with over-much precisenesse:
As our King John said, (whether wittily or wickedly, let others
judge) that the Buck he opened was fat, yet never heard Masse:
so many souldiers have been successefull without the least smack
of pietie; some such desperate villains, that fortune (to errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
judgements) may seem to have favoured them for fear.</p>
                  <p>True: but we must not consider these adventurers as plain and
mere souldiers, but as Pilgrimes and Gods armie; in whom was
required, and from whom was expected more pietie and puritie
of life and maners then in ordinarie men: whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
we shall make it appear, that they were more vitious then
the common sort of men. Nor do we this out of crueltie or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse,
to wound and mangle the memorie of the dead; but to
anatomize and open their ulcerous insides, that the dead may
teach the living, and lesson posteritie.</p>
                  <p>Besides those that went, many were either driven or fled to
the Holy land. Those were driven, who having committed some

To travell to Jerusalem to expiate their faults. Many a whore
was sent thither to find her virginitie: Many a murderer was
injoyned to fight in the Holy warre, to wash off the guilt of
Christian bloud by shedding bloud of Turks. The like was in
all other offences; malefactours were sent hither to satisfie for
their former wickednesse. Now God forbid we should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:94789:141"/>
them, if truly penitents, for impious. May he who speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
against penitents, never have the honour to be one; since Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is the younger brother to Innocence it self. But we find
that many of them reverted to their former wickednesse: they
lost none of their old faults and got many new, mending in this
hot countrey as sowre ale in summer. Others fled hither, who
having supererogated the gallows in their own countries by their
severall misdemeanours, theft, rapes, incest, murders, to avoid
the stroke of Justice, protected themselves under this voyage;
and coming to Palestine, so profited in those Eastern schools of
vices, that they learned to be more artificially wicked. This
plainly appeareth, as in sundrie other Authours, so chiefly in
Tyrius, a witnesse beyond exception, who<note n="*" place="margin">Especially in the end of King Alme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks life.</note> often complaineth
hereof. And if we value testimonies rather by the weight then
number, we must credit so grave a man, who writeth it with

the rather, because common reports (like smoke, seldome

once,<note n="*" place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 19. cap. 11.</note> hanging them for delivering up an impregnable fort to
Syracon. These like a deceitfull chirurgeon, who hath more

ill successe, That the Kings of Jerusalem took away that
citie from the Patriarchs thereof, herein committing sacriledge,
a sinne so hainous, that malice it self cannot wish an enemy guilty
of a worse. But whether or no this was sacriledge, we referre the
reader to what hath been largely discussed before.</p>
                  <p>And here I could wish to be an auditour at the learned and
unpartiall arguing of this question, Whether over-great dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the Church may not afterwards be revoked? On
the one side it would be pleaded, who should be judge of the
over-greatnesse? seeing too many are so narrow-hearted to the
Church, they count any thing too large for it; yea, some would
cut off the flesh of the Churches necessary maintenance, under
pretense to cure her of a tympanie of superfluities. Besides,
it would be alledged, What once hath been bestowed on pious
uses, must ever remain thereto: To give a thing and take a
thing, is a play too childish for children; much lesse must God
be mocked therewith, in resuming what hath been conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him. It would be argued on the other side, That when Kings
do perceive the Church readie to devoure the Commonwealth
by vast and unlimited donations unto it, and Clergie-men
grown to suspicious greatnesse, armed with hurtfull and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
priviledges derogatorie to the royaltie of Princes; then,
then it is high time for Princes to pare their overgrown great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
But this high pitch wee leave to stronger wings: Sure I
am in another kinde, this Holy warre was guiltie of sacriledge,
and for which it thrived no whit the better; in that the Pope
exempted six and twentie thousand manours in Europe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Templars and Hospitallers, from paying any
tithes to the Priest of the parish; so that many a minister in
England smarteth at this day for the Holy warre. And if this
be not sacriledge, to take away the dowrie of the Church
without assuring her any joynture in lieu of it, I report my
self to any that have not the pearl of prejudice in the eye of their
judgement.</p>

                     <p>Three grand faults in the Kingdome of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
hindring the strength and puissance thereof.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>COme we now to survey the Kingdome of Jerusalem in it self:
We will take it in its verticall point, in the beginning of
Bald wine the third, when grown to the best strength and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
yet even then had it some faults, whereby it was impossible
ever long to subsist.</p>
                  <p>1. It lay farre from any true friend. On the West it was
bounded with the mid-land-sea, but on all other sides it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed
with an Ocean of foes, and was a countrey continually
besieged with enemies. One being to sell his house, amongst
other commendations thereof, proclaimed, That his house had
a very good neighbour; a thing indeed considerable in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase,
and might advance the sale thereof a yeares value: Sure I
am, the Kingdome of Jerusalem had no such conveniencie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
bad neighbours round about: Cyprus indeed their friend
lay within a dayes sail; but alas! the Kings thereof had their
hands full to defend themselves, and could scarce spare a finger
to help any other.</p>
                  <p>2. The Kingdome was farre extended, but not well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted:
all the bodie thereof ran out in arms and legs. Besides
that ground inhabited formerly by the twelve tribes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
called the Holy land; the Kingdome of Jerusalem ranged
Northward over all Coelosyria and Cilicia in the lesser Asia:
North-eastward, it roved over the Principalities of Antioch and
Edessa, even unto Carrae beyond Euphrates: Eastward, it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
farre beyond Jordan the strong fort of Cracci, with a great
part of Arabia Petrea: Southward, it stretched to the entrance
of Egypt. But as he is a strong man, whose joynts are well set
and knit together, not whom nature hath spunne out all in length
and never thickened him; so it is the united and well compacted
Kingdome entire in it self which is strong, not that which reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and strideth the farthest. For in the midst of the Kingdome
of Jerusalem lay the Kingdome of Damascus, like a canker
feeding on the breast thereof: and clean through the Holy land,
though the Christians had many cities sprinkled here and there,
the Turks in other strong holds continued mingled amongst
them.</p>
                  <p>3. Lastly, (what we have touched once before) some sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to the Kings of Jerusalem, namely, the Princes of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,
Edessa and Tripoli, had too large and absolute power
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:94789:143"/>
and authoritie; They would do whatsoever the King would
command them, if they thought good themselves. Now sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
should be Adjectives, not able to stand without (much lesse
against) their Prince, or they will make but bad construction
otherwise.</p>
                  <p>These three hindrances in the Kingdome of Jerusalem added
to the nine former, will complete a Jurie. Now if any one
chance to censure one or two of them, let him not triumph there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;

                     <p>What is to be conceived of the incredible nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousnesse
of many armies mentioned in this
storie.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>FRequent mention hath been made through this Holy warre of
many armies, aswell Christian as Turkish, whose number of
souldiers swell very great; so as it will not be amisse once for all
to discusse the point concerning the numerousnesse of armies an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently.
And herein we branch our opinion into these severals.</p>
                  <p>1. Asian armies are generally observed greater then those of
Europe: There it is but a sucking and infant company to have
ten thousand; yea, under fiftie thousand no number. The reason
of their multitude is, not that Asia is more populous, but more
spatious then Europe. Christendome is enclosed into many
small Kingdomes and free States; which severally can send forth
no vast numbers, and seldome agree so well as to make a joynt
collection of their forces: Asia lieth in common, in large coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
and many of them united under one head. Besides, it is
probable (especially in ancient times, as may be proved out of
Scripture) that those Eastern countreys often spend their whole
stock of men, and imploy all their arms-bearing people in their
martiall service, not picking or culling them out, as we in Europe
use to do.</p>
                  <p>2. Modern armies are farre lesse then those in former ages.
The warre-<hi>genius</hi> of the world is altered now-a-dayes, and
supplieth number with policie; the foxes skinne pieceth out
the lions hide. Especially armies have been printed in a smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
letter since guns came up: One well-mounted cannon will
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:94789:143"/>
spare the presence and play the part of a whole band in a
battel.</p>
                  <p>3. Armies both of Europe, and chiefly in Asia (as farther off)
are reported farre greater then truth. Even as many old men
use to set the clock of their age too fast when once past seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
and growing ten yeares in a twelve-moneth, are presently
fourscore, yea, within a yeare or two after, climbe up to an
hundred: So it is in relating the number of souldiers; if they
exceed threescore and ten thousand, then <hi>adrotunditatem numeri,</hi>
they are hoised up to an hundred, and then fiftie thousand more
cast in for advantage. Not to speak of the facil mistake in
figures; One telleth, at the first voyage of Pilgrimes there
went forth<note n="*" place="margin">Malmesb. lib. 4. pag. 133. <hi>Sexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi> (surely a mistake for <hi>sexies) cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum millia.</hi>
                     </note> six hundred thousand:<note n="*" place="margin">Lamp. Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lific. hist. pag. 313.</note> another counteth three
hundred thousand slain at the last taking of Ptolemais:
their glib pens making no more reckoning of men then of
pinnes. We perchance may do justly in imitating the unjust
steward, setting down in the bill of our belief but fifty for every
hundred.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it any Paradox, but what will abide the touch, That
competent forces of able and well-appointed and well-disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined
souldiers under an experienced Generall, are farre more
usefull then such an unwieldie multitude. Little loadstones will
in proportion attract a greater quantitie of steel then those
which be farre greater, because their poles are nearer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and so their virtue more united: So shall we find braver
atchievements by moderate armies, then by such portentous

by the statue of S. Christopher in Paris, though he be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of a mountainlike then manlike bignesse. Yea, such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
great armies are subject to great inconveniences.
1. They are not so easily manageable; and the commands of
their Generall cool, and lose some virtue in passing so long a
journey through so many. 2. It is improbable that so many
thousands can be heaped together, but the armie will be very
heterogeneous, patched up of different people unsuiting in
their maners, which must needs occasion much cumbrance.
3. These crowds of souldiers may hinder one another in their
service; as many at the same time pressing out at a wicket.
4. Victuals for so many mouthes will not easily be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided;
the provisions of a countrey serving them but a meal,
they must fast afterwards. 5. Lastly, such great numbers
(though this, I must confesse, is onely <hi>per accidens,</hi> yet often
incident) beget carelessenesse and confidence in them; as
if they would not thank God for their victories, but conceive
it a due debt owed to their multitudes. This hath induced
some to the opinion to maintain, That a competent able armie

                  <p>XErxes viewing his armie, consisting of more then a million,
from an high place all at a sight, is said to weep at the
thought, That within an hundred yeares all those would be

people which lost their lives in this action!</p>
                  <p>In the first voyage went forth (as the most conscionable<note place="margin">1095</note>

led hither by Hugh brother to the King of France and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
other Bishops, not a thousand came into Palestine.</p>
                  <p>In the third voyage, Conrade the Emperour led forth no
fewer then two hundred thousand foot and fiftie thousand horse;
nor was the armie of King Lewis of France farre inferiour: Of
whom such as returned make no noise, as not considerable in
number.</p>
                  <p>At the fourth setting forth, Frederick Barbarossa counted an
hundred and fiftie thousand souldiers in his armie: Of whom
when they came to Ptolemais, no more then<note n="*" place="margin">P. Aemyl in Phil. Aug. pag. 175.</note> eighteen hundred

                  <p>Fifthly, what numbers were carried forth by our Richard

                  <p>To omit severall other intermediate actions of many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who went forth with armies and scarce came home with

                     <p>The throne of Deserts: What nation merited most
praise in this warre; And first of the French
and Dutch service therein.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AS in the first book we welcomed each severall nation when
they first entred into this service; so it is good manners
now to take our solemn farewell of them at their going out, and
to examine which of them deserved most commendation for
their valour in this warre. And herein me thinketh the distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
usuall in some Colledges, of Founders, By founders, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactours,
may properly take place. The Founders of this Holy
warre, are the French; the By-founders, the Dutch, English,
and Italian; the Benefactours (according to the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of bountie) the Spanish, Polish, Danish, Scots, and all
other people of Europe.</p>
                  <p>The French I make the Founders for these reasons: First,
because they began the action first. Secondly, France in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
sent most adventurs. Some voyages were all of
French, and all voyages were of some French. Yea, French
men were so frequent at Jerusalem, That at this day all Western
Europeans there are called Franks (as once I conceived, and
perchance not without companie in my errour) because so
many French men came thither in the Holy warre. Since, I
am converted from that false opinion, having found that two
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:94789:146"/>
hundred yeares before the Holy warre was dreamed of, namely,
in the time of Constantine<note n="*" place="margin">Vide M. Solden on Polyelbion, pag. 150.</note> Porphyrogenetes Emperour of the
East, all Western Christians were known to the Greeks by the
name of <hi>Franks;</hi> so that it seemeth the Turks borrowed that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation
from the Grecians. Thirdly, as France sent the most
so many of most eminent note: She sheweth for the game no
worse cards then a pair royall of Kings; Lewis the Young, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip
Augustus, and Saint Lewis; besides Philip the Bold his
sonne, who went half-way to Tunis. The first and last Christian
King of Europe that went to Palestine was a French man; and
all the Kings of Jerusalem, Frederick the Emperour onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
originally were of that nation. Fouthly, even at this
day France is most loyall to the cause. Most grand Masters of
the Hospitallers have been French men: And at this day the
Knights of Malta, who have but four Albergies or Seminaries
in all Christendome, have<note n="*" place="margin">Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ndy; Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, pag. 229.</note> three of them in France; viz. one
of France in generall, one of Avergne, and one of Provence.
Yet France carrieth not the upper hand so clearly, but that Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie
justleth for it; especially if we adde to it the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
the best stable of wooden horses, and most potent in
shipping in that age of any countrey in Europe: which though
an <hi>amphibion</hi> betwixt both, yet custome at this day adjudgeth it
Dutch.</p>
                  <p>Now these are the severall accents of honour in the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
service: First, That countrey sheweth three Emperours
in the Holy warre; Conrade, Frederick Barbarossa, and Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick
the second. The last of these was solemnly crowned
and peaceably possessed King of Jerusalem. Secondly, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie
sent more Princes to this warre then all Europe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.
It would be an infinite task to reckon them all; it being
true of the Germane Nobility, what Logicians say of a <hi>line,</hi>
that it is <hi>divisibilis in semper divisibilia.</hi> Here honours equally
descend to sonnes and daughters; whereby they have Counts
without counting in the whole Empire: There were seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Princes of Henault, and seven and twenty Earls of Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field
all living together: So that one of their own countrey men
saith, that the Dutch esteem none to be men, but onely such
as are Noble-men. We will not take notice of Germanie as it
is minced into petty Principalities, but as cut into principall
Provinces. We find these regnant Princes (for as for their
younger brethren, herein they are not accounted) to have been
personally present in the Holy warre:

All these (I say not, these were all) went themselves, and led
forth other companies, suitable to their greatnesse. The Reader,
as he lighteth on more, at his leisure may strike them into this
catalogue. Thirdly, Germanie maintained the Teutonick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
wholly consisting of her nation; besides Templars and
Hospitallers, whereof she had abundance: of whose loyall and
valiant service we have spoken largely before. Lastly, She fought
another Holy warre at the same time against the Tartars and
other barbarous people, which invaded her on her North-east<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.
And though some will except, That that warre cannot be
intituled Holy, because being on the defensive, it was rather of
nature and necessitie then pietie: yet upon examination it will
appear, that this service was lesse superstitious, more charitable
to Christendome, and more rationall and discreet in it self; it
being better husbandrie, to save a whole cloth in Europe, then to
winne a ragge in Asia.</p>

Danish, and Swedish performance in this warre.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>NExt in this race of honour follow England and Italie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
verie even and hard-matched. England (it is no flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
to affirm what envie cannot denie) spurreth up close for
the prize; and though she had a great disadvantage in the
starting, (Italie being much nearer to Palestine) yet she quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recovered it. Our countrey sent one King, (Richard the
first) and three Kings sonnes (Robert Courthois, Richard of
Cornwall, and Prince Edward) to this warre. Yea, England
was a dayly friend to this action: and besides these great and
grosse summes of visible adventurers, she dropped and cast in
privily many a Pilgrime of good qualitie; so that there was
scarce any remarkable battel or memorable siege done through
the warre wherein there were not some English of eminent
desert.</p>
                  <p>Yet Italy cometh not any whit behind, if the atchievements
of her severall States, Venetians, Genoans, Pisans, Sicilians,
Florentines, were made and moulded up together. Yea, for sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service
and engineers in this warre, they bear the bell away
from all other nations. But these things allay the Italian service:
1. It was not so abstracted from the dregs of mercinarinesse as
that of other countreys, (whose adventurers counted their very
work herein sufficient wages) but before they would yield their
assistance they indented and covenanted with the King of Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
to have such and such profits, pensions, and priviledges in
all places they took, to them and their posteritie; not as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norarie
reward freely conferred on them but in nature of wages
<hi>ex pacto</hi> contracted for aforehand: as the Genoans had in Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais,
and the Venetians in Tyre. 2. These Italians stopped
two gaps with one bush:<note place="margin">Tyrius, lib. 10 cap. 28. &amp; lib. 12. cap. 25.</note> they were Merchant-Pilgrimes, and
together applied themselves to profit and pietie. Here in Tyre
they had their banks, and did drive a sweet trade of spices and
other Eastern commodities. 3. Lastly, As at first they gave
good milk, so they kicked it down with their heel, and by their
mutuall discord caused the losse of all they helped to gain in
Syria.</p>
                  <p>Spain was exercised all the time of this warre in defending
her self against the Moores and Saracens in her own bowels:
Yet such was her charitie, that whilest her own house was on
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:94789:147"/>
burning, she threw some buckets of water to quench her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:
and as other nations cast their superfluitie, she her wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
mite into the treasurie of this action; and produceth two
Theobalds Kings of Navarre, and Alphonse King of Castile,
that undertook expeditions to Palestine.</p>
                  <p>Hungary sheweth one King, Andrew; who washed himself
in Jordan, and then shrinking in the wetting returned present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
home again. But this countrey, though it self did go little,
yet was much gone through to the Holy warre (being the rode
to Syria for all land armies) and merited well in this action, in
giving peaceable passage and courteous entertainment to Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes;
as to Duke Godfrey, and Frederick Barbarossa, with all
their souldiers as they travelled through it. Had the Kings of
Hungarie had the same principle of basenesse in their souls as
the Emperours of Grecia, they had had the same cause of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
against the Christians that passed this way; yet they used
them most kindly, and disdained all dishonourable suspicio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s.
True it is, at the first voyage, King Coloman, not out of crueltie
but carefulnesse and necessary securitie, did use his sword against
some unruly and disorderly Pilgrimes: but none were there abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
which first abused not themselves. But what-ever Hungarie
was in that age, it is at this day Christendomes best land bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark
against the Turks: Where this prettie custome is used,
That the men wear so many feathers as they have killed Turks;
which if observed elsewhere, either feathers would be lesse, or
valour more in fashion.</p>
                  <p>Poland could not stirre in this warre, as lying constant <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due</hi>

Crispus Duke or King thereof (waiting on, shall I say?
or) accompanying Conrade the Emperour in his voyage to
Palestine; and having defraid all his and his armies costs and
charges towards Constantinople, he returned home, as not
to be spared in his own Countrey. But if by King Davids<note n="*" place="margin">1. Sam. 30. 24.</note> sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
the keepers of the baggage are to be sharers in the spoil
with the fighters of the battel, then surely Poland and such
other countreys may entitle themselves to the honour of the
warre in Palestine; which in the mean time kept home, had an
eye to the main chance, and defended Europe against forrein
invaders.</p>
                  <p>Norway (in that age the sprucest of the three Kingdomes of
Scandia, and best tricked up with shipping; though at this
day the case is altered with her, and she turned from taking to
paying of tribute) sent her fleet of tall souldiers to Syria:
who like good fellows, asked nothing for their work but their
victuals, and valiantly wonne the city of Sidon for the King
of Jerusalem. And it is considerable, that Syria (but a step or

here forget a Saint, Willam a Scot, of Perth by birth, by trade
a baker, in charitie so abundant that he gave his tenth loaf to the
poore, in zeal so fervent that he vowed to visit the Holy land.
But in his journey, as he passed through Kent,<note place="margin">Lambert, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amb. Kent.</note> he was slain by his

thereof be called <hi>artificium naturae.</hi> It seemeth Pilgrimes carried

(saith my Authour) for their good service at the siege
of Damiata were admitted into that Order.</p>
                  <p>2. Saracens heads; It being a maxime in Heraldrie, that it
is more honourable to bear the head then any other part of the
bodie. They are commonly born either black or bloudie. But
if Saracens in their Arms should use Christians heads, I doubt
not but they would shew ten to one.</p>
                  <p>3. Pilgrimes or Palmers Scrips or Bags; the Arms of the

                  <p>5. But the chiefest of all is the Crosse, which though born in
Arms before, yet was most commonly and generally used since
the Holy warre. The plain Crosse, or S. Georges Crosse, I
take to be the mother of all the rest; as plain-song is much se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niour
to any running of division. Now as by transposition of a
few letters, a world of words are made; so by the varying of
this Crosse in form, colour, and metall (ringing as it were the
changes) are made infinite severall Coats: The Crosse of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
or <hi>five crosses,</hi> most frequently used in this warre; Crosse
<hi>Patée,</hi> because the ends thereof are broad; <hi>Fichée,</hi> whose bottom
is sharp, to be fixed in the ground; <hi>Wavée,</hi> which those may
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:94789:149"/>
justly wear who sailed thither through the miseries of the sea,
or sea of miseries: <hi>Molinée,</hi> because like to the rind of a mill:
<hi>Saltyrée,</hi> or S. Andrews Crosse: <hi>Florid,</hi> or garlanded with flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
the Crosse <hi>crossed:</hi> Besides the divers tricking or dressing; as
piercing, voiding, fimbriating, ingrailing, couping; And in fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
and devices there is still a <hi>plus ultra;</hi> insomuch that Crosses
alone as they are variously disguised, are enough to distinguish all
the severall families of Gentlemen in England.</p>
                  <p>Exemplary is the Coat of George Villiers Duke of Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;
five Scallop-shells on a plain Crosse, speaking his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours
valour in the Holy warre. For Sir Nicolas de Villi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
Knight, followed Edward the first in his warres in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
land; and then and there assumed this his new Coat: For
formerly he bore Sable three Cinquefoils Argent. This<note n="*" place="margin">Burton in Leicestershire.</note> Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas
was the ancestour of the Duke of Buckingham, lineally
descended from the ancient familie of Villiers in Normandie;
then which name none more redoubred in this service: For we
<note n="*" place="margin">Hospin. De orig. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Ioan.</note> find John de Villiers the one and twentieth Master of the
Hospitallers; and another Philip de Villiers Master of Rhodes,
under whom it was surrendred to the Turks; a yielding equall to
a conquest.</p>
                  <p>Yet should one labour to find a Mysterie in all Arms, relating
to the qualitie or deserts of the owners of them (like Chrysip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,
who troubled himself with a great contention to find out a
Stoicall assertion of Philosophie in every fiction of the Poets) he
would light on a labour in vain. For I believe (be it spoken
with loyaltie to all Kings of Arms, and Heralds their Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
in that facultie) that at the first, the<note n="*" place="margin">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ridly, View of the Civil law, § 5. pag. 100.</note> will of the bearer
was the reason of the bearing; or if at their originall of assuming
them there were some speciall cause, yet time since hath cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it: And as in Mythologie, the morall hath often been made
since the Fable; so a sympathy betwixt the Arms and the bearer
hath sometimes been of later invention. I denie not but in some
Coats some probable reason may be assigned of bearing them:
But it is in vain to digge for mines in every ground, because there
is lead in Mendip hills.</p>

                     <p>Some offers of Christian Princes for Palestine
since the end of the Holy warre, by Henry the
fourth of England, Charles the eighth of France,
and Iames the fourth of Scotland.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AS after that the bodie of the sunne is set, some shining still
surviveth in the West: so after this Holy warre was expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
we find some straggling rayes and beams of valour offering
that way; ever and anon the Christian Princes having a bout
with that design. To collect the severall essayes of Princes
glancing on that project, were a task of great pains and small
profit; specially, some of them being umbrages and State-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
rather then realities, to ingratiate Princes with
their subjects, or with the oratorie of so pious a project to wooe
money out of peoples purses, or thereby to cloke and cover
armies levied to other intents: Besides, most of their designes
were abortive, or aborsive rather, like those untimely mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages
not honoured with a soul or the shape and lineaments
of an infant. Yet to save the Readers longing, we will give
him a tast or two; and begin with that of our Henry the fourth
of England.</p>
                  <p>The end of the reign of this our Henry was peaceable and
prosperous. For though his title was builded on a bad foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
yet it had strong buttresses: most of the Nobilitie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
and fenced it: And as for the house of York, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
not; its best bloud as yet ranne in feminine veins,
and therefore was the lesse active. Now King Henry in the
sunne-shine evening of his life (after a stormy day) was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to walk abroad, and take in some forrein aire. He pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his thoughts on the Holy<note n="*" place="margin">Lord Veru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam, in his Henry vii. pag. 87.</note> warre, for to go to Jerusalem,
and began to provide for the same. One principall motive
which incited him was, That it was told him he should not
die till he had heard Masse in Jerusalem. But this proved
not like the revelation told to old<note n="*" place="margin">Luke 2. 26.</note> Simeon: for King Henry
was fain to sing his <hi>Nunc dimittis,</hi> before he expected; and died
in the chamber called <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in Westminster. By com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
this prophesie with one of Apollo's oracles, we may
conclude them to be brethren (they are so alike) and both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
of the father of lies: for the Devil eartheth himself in
an homonymie, as a fox in the ground; if he be stopped at one
hole, he will get out at another. How-ever, the Kings purpose
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:94789:150"/>
deserveth remembrance and commendation, because really and
seriously intended.</p>
                  <p>Farre better, I believe, then that of Charles the eighth King
of France: Who in a braving Embassage which he sent to our
Henry the seventh, gave him to understand his resolutions; to
make re-conquest of Naples, but as of a bridge to<note n="*" place="margin">L. Verulam. in Henry vii.</note> transport
his forces into Grecia; and then not to spare bloud or treasure
(if it were to the impairing of his Crown and dispeopling of
France) till either he had overthrown the Empire of the Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
or taken it in his way to paradise; and hence (belike) he
would have at Jerusalem, invited (as he said) with the former
example of our Henry the fourth. But our King Henry the
seventh (being too good a fencer to mistake a flourish for a blow)
quickly resented his drift (which was to perswade our King to
peace, till Charles should perform his projects in little Britain
and elsewhere) and dealt with him accordingly. And as for the
gradation of King Charles his purposes, Naples, Grecia, Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
a stately but difficult ascent, (where the stairs are so farre
asunder, the legs must be long to stride them) the French nation
was weary of climbing the first, and then came down, vaulting
nimbly into Naples and out of it again.</p>
                  <p>More cordiall was that of<note n="*" place="margin">Buchanan, in the life of Iames iiii.</note> James the fourth King of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
that pious Prince: who being touched in conscience for his
fathers death (though he did not cause it, but seemed to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
it with his presence) ever after, in token of his contrition,
wore an iron chain about his body; and to expiate his fault, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
a journey into Syria. He prepared his navie, provided his
souldiers, imparted his project to forrein Princes; and verily had
gone, if at the first other warres, and afterwards sudden death
had not caused his stay.</p>

an holy voyage to Palestine; chose his company out
of many Noblemen and Earles, in number ninetie eight: He
happily finished his journey; onely one of them died in Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus.
He brought back with him six and fourtie ensignes of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:94789:151"/>
horse.</q> Seven moneths were spent in the voyage, <hi>Fab.</hi> So
tarre Calvisius, avouching this Fab. for his authour. Each
word a wonder; not to say, an impossibilitie. What? in the
yeare 1460, when the deluge of Mahometanes had overrun most
of Grecia, Asia, and Syria? William, a Landt grave (of Hesse,
no doubt) neither the greatest nor next to the greatest Prince in
Germanie, farre from the sea, unfurnished with shipping, not
within the suspicion of so great a performance? Six and fourtie
horse-ensignes taken? Where? or from whom? Was it in warre,
and but one man killed? A battel so bloudlesse seemeth as truth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse;
and the losing but of one man savoureth of never a one.
But seven moneths spent? Such atchievements beseem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an apprentiship of yeares then moneths. Besides, was
Fame all the while dead, speechlesse, or asleep, that she trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peted
not this action abroad? Did only this Fab. take notice
of it? be he Faber, Fabius, Fabianus, Fabinianus, or what you
please. Why is it not storied in other writers? the Dutch men
giving no scant measure in such wares, and their Chronicles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more guiltie of remembring trifles then forgetting matters
of moment.</p>
                  <p>Yet the gravity of Calvisius recording it, moveth me much
on the other side; a Chronologer of such credit, that he may
take up more belief on his bare word then some other on their

                     <p>The fortunes of Ierusalem since the Holy warre;
and her present estate.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>SEven yeares after the Latine Christians were finally expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
out of Syria, some hope presented it self of reestablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them again. For Casanus the great Tartar Prince, having
of late subdued the Persians, and married the daughter of
the Armenian King (a Lady of great perfection) and of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometane
become a Christian, at the request of his wife he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
the citic<note n="*" place="margin">Centuriato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. pag. totius operis penult.</note> Jerusalem, and took it without resistance. The
Temple of our Saviour he gave to the Armenians,<note place="margin">1298</note> Georgians,
and other Christians, which flocked thick out of Cyprus there
to inhabit. But soon after his departure it fell back again to
the Mammalukes of Egypt; who enjoyed it till Selimus the
great Turk, <hi>anno</hi> 1517, overthrew the Empire of Mammalukes,
and seised Jerusalem into his hand: whose successours keep it at
this day.</p>
                  <p>Jerusalem better acquitteth it self to the eare then to the
eye; being no whit beautifull at all. The situation thereof is
very uneven, rising into hils and sinking into dales; the lively
embleme of the fortunes of the place; sometimes advanced
with prosperitie, sometimes depressed in misery. Once it was
well compacted, and<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 122. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>built as a citie that is at unitie in it self;</hi> but
now distracted from it self: the suspicious houses (as if afraid
to be infected with more miserie then they have alreadie, by
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:94789:152"/>
contiguousnesse to others) keep off at a distance, having many
waste places betwixt them; not one<note n="*" place="margin">Bydulph, pag. 117.</note> fair street in the whole
citie.</p>
                  <p>It hath a castle, built (as it is thought) by the Pisans,<note n="*" place="margin">Sandys Travels, pag. 158.</note> tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
fortified. Good guard is kept about the citie, and no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
with weapons suffered to enter. But the deepest ditch to
defend Jerusalem from the Western Christians, is the remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of it; and the strongest wall to fence it, is the Turkish Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
compassing it round about.</p>
                  <p>Poor it must needs be, having no considerable commoditie
to vent; except a few beads of Holy earth, which they pay too
deare for that have them for the ferching. There is in the citie a
covent of Franciscans, to whom Christians repair for protection
during their remaining in the citie. The Padre Guardian appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
these Pilgrimes a Friar, who sheweth them all the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
about the citie: Scarce a great stone, which beareth the
brow of reverend antiquitie, that passeth without a peculiar le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend
upon it: But every vault under ground hath in it a deep
mysterie indeed. Pilgrimes must follow the Friar with their
bodies and belief; and take heed how they give tradition the
lie, though she tell one never so boldly. The survey finished,
they must pay the Guardian both for their victuals and their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and gratifie his good words and looks; otherwise if they
forget it, he will be so bold as to remember them. The Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
farmeth the Sepulchre of the Turk at a yearly rent: and the
Turks which reap no benefit by Christs death, receive much
profit by his buriall; and not content with their yearly rent,
squeez the Friars here on all occasions, making them pay large
summes for little offenses.</p>
                  <p>The other subsistence which the Friars here have, is from
the benevolence of the Pope and other bountifull benefactours
in Europe. Nor getteth the Padre Guardian a little by his fees
of making Knights of the Sepulchre: of which Order I
find, some hundred yeares since, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> John Chamond of<note n="*" place="margin">Carew, in his survey of Cornwall. pag. 118.</note> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
in Cornwall to have been dubbed Knight. But I believe no
good English subject at this day will take that honour, if offered
him; both because at their creation they are to swear loyaltie
to the Pope and<note n="*" place="margin">Bydulph. pag. 119.</note> King of Spain, and because honours
conferred by forrein Potentates are not here in England acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
neither in their style nor precedency, except given by
courtesie: Witnesse that famous case of the Count Arundel
of Wardour, and Queen Elisabeths peremptory resolve, That
her sheep should be branded with no<note n="*" place="margin">Camdens Elisabeth. in anno 2 96.</note> strangers mark, but
her own.</p>
                  <p>The land about it (as Authours generally agree) is barren. Yet

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:94789:152"/>
since, commendeth it to be very fruitfull. Sure he had better
eyes to see more then other men could; or else by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi>
he imputeth the fertilitie of parcels to the whole countrey. But
it is as false a consequence, as, on the other side, to conclude
from the basenesse of Bagshot-heath, the barrennesse of all the
Kingdome of England. We may rather believe, that since the
fall of the Jews from Gods favour, the once-supernaturall ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of the land is taken away, and the naturall strength thereof
much abated and impaired.</p>

                     <p>Whether it be probable that this Holy warre will
ever hereafter be set on foot again.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THus we state the question; Whether this Holy warre, I
mean, for the winning of the citie of Jerusalem and recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Palestine, will probably ever hereafter be projected and
acted again. We may believe this tragedie came off so ill the
last acting, that it will not be brought on the stage the second
time.</p>
                  <p>1. The Pope will never offer to give motion to it, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it unlikely to succeed. Policies of this nature are like sleights
of hand, to be shewed but once; lest what is admired at first be
derided afterwards.</p>
                  <p>2. Princes are grown more cunning, and will not bite at a
bait so stale, so often breathed on. The Popes ends in this warre
are now plainly smelt out; which though prettie and pleasing at
first, yet Princes are not now, like the native Indians, to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zened
with glasse and gaudie toyes: The loadstone to draw their
affection (now out of non-age) must present it self necessary,
profitable, and probable to be effected.</p>
                  <p>3. There is a more needfull work nearer hand; to resist the
Turks invasion in Europe. Heark how the Grecians call unto us,
as once<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 16. 9.</note> the man in the vision did to S. Paul, Come over into
Macedonia, and help us. Yea, look on the Popes projects of
the last Edition, and we shall find the businesse of the Sepulchre
buried in silence, and the Holy warre running in another chanel,
against the Turks in Christendome.</p>
                  <p>4 Lastly, who is not sensible with sorrow of the dissensions
(better suiting with my prayers then my penne) wherewith
Christian Princes at this day are rent in sunder? wounds so wide
that onely Heavens chirurgerie can heal them: Till which time
no hope of a Holy warre against the generall and common foe
of our Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="278" facs="tcp:94789:153"/>We may safely conclude, that the regaining of Jerusalem
and the Holy land from the Turks, may better be placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
our desires then our hopes; as improbable ever to
come to passe: except the Platonick yeare, turning the wheel
of all actions round about, bring the spoke of this Holy warre
back again.</p>

James the bastard of Cyprus, that this list was taken about the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:94789:153"/>
yeare 1466. And now how would a Herald sweat with scouring
over these time-rustie titles, to shew whence these Princes deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their severall claims, and in whom the right resteth at this
day? and when his work is done, who should pay him his wages?</p>
                  <p>My clew of thread is not strong enough, on the guidance
thereof for me to venture into this labyrinth of Pedegrees; we
will content our selves with these generall observations:</p>
                  <p>1. It seemeth this catalogue containeth as well those who
had <hi>jus in Regno</hi> as those who had <hi>jus ad Regnum:</hi> as namely,
the Prince of Thorone, and Patriarchs of Jerusalem, and State
of Genoa; whose ambition surely soared not so high as to claim
the Kingdome of Jerusalem, but rather perched it self upon some
lands and Signories challenged therein.</p>
                  <p>2. A small matter will serve to intitle a Prince to a titular
Kingdome: In this case, Kings can better digest corrivals where
they be many, and all challenge what is worth nothing. In this
catalogue it seemeth some onely intitle themselves out of good
fellowship and love of good company: These like squirrels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
themselves, and climbe up to a claim on the least bough,
twig, yea leaf of a Right. Thus the Counts of Brienne in France
(if any still remain of that house) gave away their cake and
kept it still; in that John Bren parted with his right to this
Kingdome, in match with Iole his daughter to Frederick the
second Emperour, and yet the Earls of his familie pretend still
to Jerusalem.</p>
                  <p>3. We may believe, that by matches and under-matches
some of these titles may reside in private Gentlemen; especially
in France: And what wonder? seeing within fourteen generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 1. 16.</note> royall bloud of the Kings of Judah ran in the veins of
plain Joseph a painfull carpenter.</p>
                  <p>4. At this day some of those titles are finally extinct: as that
of the Emperours of the East, conquered by the Ottoman fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
Their Imperiall Eagle was so far from beholding the sunne,
that the half-moon dazzled, yea quite put out his eyes. Rank in
the same form the Kings of Armenia, and Sultans of Egypt.</p>
                  <p>5. Some of these titles are translated: That of the Lusignans,
Kings of Cyprus, probably passed with that Island to the State
of Venice; The claim of the Hungarian Kings seemeth at this
day to remain in the Germane Emperour.</p>
                  <p>6. Some united: The claim of the Archdukes of Nize (a
style I meet not with elsewhere) twisted with that of the Duke
Savoy; The Kings of Naples and Aragon now joyned in the
King of Spain.</p>
                  <p>7. Of those which are extant at this day, Englands appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Our Poet Harding, in a paper he presented to King Henry

wayes: Either because he was the first and chiefest mover and
advancer of this warre, Lord Paramont of this action, and all the
Pilgrimes no better then his servants; and then according to the
rule in Civil law,<note n="*" place="margin">Institut. lib. 1. tit. 8. §. 1.</note>

also gave it away in match with his daughter: Or else he deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth

of others. First he bestowed his title on Charles of Anjou,

King of Sicilie (from which root spring the many-branched
French competitours) and since hath conferred the same on the
house of Aragon, or King of Spain. Which King alone weareth
it in his style at this day, and maketh continuall warre with the
Turk, who detaineth Jerusalem from him: Yea, all West Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome

hot between England and Spain, there were Commissioners
on both sides appointed to treat of peace: They met at a
town of the French Kings: and first it was debated, what
tongue the negotiation should be handled in. A Spaniard,
thinking to give the English Commissioners a shrewd gird,
proposed the French tongue as most fit, it being a language
which the Spaniards were well skilled in; and for these Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of England, I suppose (said he) that they cannot be
ignorant of the language of their fellow-subjects; their Queen
is Queen of France as well as England. Nay in faith, Masters
(replyed Doctor Dale, the Master of Requests) the French
tongue is too vulgar for a businesse of this secrecie and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,

mines then in her remotenesse) lieth free from the reach there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p>Populous it is not; for men will never grow thick where
meat groweth thinne: It lieth waste, according to the old
Proverb, Grasse springeth not where the Grand Signors horse
setteth his foot. Besides, a third part (I may say, halfe)
of those in Turkie are not Turks, but either Jews or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
                  <p>The strength of this Empire consisteth either in bones or
stones, men or munition. Of the first, The best stake in the
Turks hedge is his great number of Horsemen called<note n="*" place="margin">Knolls, in his descrip. of the greatnesse of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Empire.</note> Tima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,
conceived to exceed seven hundred thousand fighting
men: These are dispersed over all Dominions, and have
lands allotted unto them in reward of their good service and
valour, much in the nature of those souldiers of the Romish
Empire called <hi>Beneficiari.</hi> And indeed the Turkish Empire
resembleth the Romane in many particulars: not that they
ever studied imitation, and by reading of Historie conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their State to Romane precedents, (farre be it from us
to wrong them with the false imputation of so much learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
but rather casually they have met in some common
principles of policie. Of these Timariots, on occasion and
competent warning, he can bring into the field an hundred
and fiftie thousand, all bound by the tenure of their lands
to arme, clothe, feed, pay themselves: So great an armie,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:94789:155"/>
which would drain the wealth of other Princes, doth cost the
great Turk no drop of expense.</p>
                  <p>Next follow his best footmen, called Janizaries, taken
young from their Christian parents (parallel to the Romane
Pretorian souldiers) being the guard of the Grand Signors
person. But as they watch about him, so he casteth a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
eye on them; seeing of late they are grown from painfull
to be proud, yea insolent and intolerable: it being true of these
Janizaries in the Turkish Empire, as of Elephants in an armie;
If well ruled, they alone are enough to winne the battel; if
unruly, they alone are enough to lose it. As for all other
sorts of the Turks, both foot and horse, they are but slugs; as
whom the Grand Signor little trusteth, and others need lesse
fear.</p>
                  <p>His Frontier cities, especially those which respect Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
are exactly fortified. Rank with these such places of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
and castles as command passages of consequence. As
for his inland-cities, there is no superfluous, scarce competent,
strength in them. But if we allow those people to be chaste
who never were solicited to be otherwise, then may many cities
lying in the bowels of his Empire passe for strong, which for a
long time have not had not in haste are likely to have the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of a siege.</p>
                  <p>Of Ordinance he hath great store, and hath excellent mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
to make them of; and is also very powerfull in shipping.
Indeed ships of great burden would be burdensome in those
narrow seas, and experience hath found lesser vessels of greater
use, whereof he hath store. And though the Turks either want
ingenie or industrie, either care not or cannot be good ship-wrights
themselves; yet the spite is, as long as there is gold
amongst the Turks there will be drosse amongst the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
I mean some who for base gain will betray the mysteries
of our usefull arts unto them. As for wood to build with, he
hath excellent in Bithynia; yea, generally in this wild Empire,
trees grow better then men. To his sea-munition may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
his multitude of slaves, though not the informing yet
(against their wills) the assisting form of his Galleys, and in
whom consisteth a great part of their strength and swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                  <p>Nor must we forget the Pirates of Tunis and Algier, which
are Turks and no Turks: Sometimes the Grand Signor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth,
renounceth, and casteth them off to stand upon their
own bottom; as when those Christian Princes which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
with him, complain to him of the wrongs those sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>obbers
have done them. But though he sendeth them out
to seek their own meat, he can clock them under his wings
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:94789:156"/>
at pleasure: And we may verily believe, though sometimes in
the summer of his own prosperitie he throweth them off as an
upper garment of no use, yet in cold weather he will buckle them
on again; and if necessitie pincheth him, receive them not as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
at large but as his best servants in ordinarie.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it the last and least part of the strength of this Empire,
that all her native people are linked together in one religion:
The discords about which in other Kingdomes have been the
cause, first of the unjoynting, and then of the finall ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
of many worthy States: Whereas here, the Mahometane
religion (if I wrong it not with so good a name) is so full of unitie
and agreement, that there is no difference and dissension about it.
Yea, well may that coat have no seam which hath no shape. A
senselesse ignorant profession it is, not able to go to the cost of a
controversie: And all colours may well agree in the dark.</p>
                  <p>Next the strength followeth the wealth; yea, it is part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
For all rich Kingdomes may be strong, and purchase artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
fortification. The certain and constant revenues of the great
Turk are not great, if withall we consider the spatiousnesse of
his Dominions. Some have mounted his ordinarie yearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to eight<note n="*" place="margin">Knolls.</note> millions of gold. But men guesse by uncertain
aim at Princes revenues; especially if they be so remote: We
may believe that in their conjecture herein, though they misse
the mark, they hit the butt. Farre greater might his <hi>intrado</hi> be, if
husband<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ie, and chiefly merchandise, were plied in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
merchants being the <hi>Vena porta</hi> of a Kingdome; without
which it may have good limbes, but emptie veins, and nourish
little. Now although this Empire be of a vast extent, having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
safe harbours to receive strangers there, and Stable commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
(chiefly if industrie were used) to allure them thither; yet
hath it in effect but foure prime places of trading; Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,
Cairo, Aleppo, and Tauris. As for the extraordinarie
revenues of the Grand Signor, by his escheats and other courses,
if he pleaseth to take them, they are a <hi>Nemo scit:</hi> For in effect he
is worth as much as all his subjects (or flaves rather) through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his whole Empire are worth, his spunges to squeeze at
pleasure.</p>
                  <p>But the Lion is not so fierce as he is painted, nor this Empire
so formidable as fame giveth it out. The Turks head is lesse
then his turbant, and his turbant lesse then it seemeth; swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
without, hollow within. If more seriously it be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
this State cannot be strong, which is a pure and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
tyrannie. His subjects under him have nothing certain but
this, That they have nothing certain; and may thank the Grand
Signot for giving them whatsoever he taketh not away from
them. Their goods they hold by permission not proprietie;
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:94789:156"/>
not sure that either they or theirs shall reap what they sow, or
eat what they reap: and hereupon husbandrie is wholly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected:
For the plowman (aswell as the ground he ploweth)
will be soon out of heart, if not maintained and (as I may say)
composted with hopes to receive benefit by his labours. Here
great officers, if they love themselves, must labour not to bee
beloved: for popularitie is high treason; and generally wealth
is a sinne to be expiated by death. In a word, it is a cruel tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
bathed in the bloud of their Emperours upon every successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
a heap of vassals and slaves; no Nobles (except for time
being, by office) no Gentlemen, no Free-men, no inheritance of
land, no Stirp or ancient families; a nation without any mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
arts and sciences, that can scarce measure an acre of land or
houre of a day.</p>
                  <p>And needeth not that Kingdome constant and continued
pointing, which is cemented with fear not love? May wee not
justly think, that there be many in this Empire which rather
wait a time then want desire to overthrow it? For though
some thinke the Grecians in Turkie bear such inveterate hate
to the Latine Christians, that they would rather refuse delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
then accept them for their deliverers; yet surely both
they, and perchance some native Turks, out of that principle
of desiring libertie (the second rule next preserving life in the
charter of Nature) would be made (if this Empire were seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
invaded, so that the foundation thereof did totter)
sooner to find two hands to pluck it downe then one finger to
hold it up.</p>
                  <p>And we have just cause to hope that the fall of this unwiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
Empire doth approch. It was high noon with it fiftie yeares
ago; we hope now it draweth near night: the rather, because
luxurie, though late, yet at last hath found the Turks out, or
they it. When first they came out of Turcomania, and were in
their pure naturals, they were wonderfully abstemious, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
all voluptuousnesse, not so much out of a dislike as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of it: But now having tasted the sweetnesse of the cup, they
can drink as great a draught as any others. That Paradise of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
pleasure which Mahomet promised them in the world
to come, they begin to anticipate here, at leastwise to take an
earnest of it, and have well soked themselves in luxurie. Yea,
now they begin to grow covetous, both Prince and people, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
seeking to enjoy their means with quiet then enlarge them
with danger.</p>
                  <p>Heaven can as easily blast an oak as trample a mushrome.
And we may expect the ruine of this great Empire will come:
for of late it hath little increased its stock, and now begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to spend of the principall. It were arrant presumption
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:94789:157"/>
for Flesh to prescribe God his way; or to teach him, when he
meaneth to shoot, which arrow in his quiver to choose. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
the Western Christians, or the Grecians under him
(though these be better for seconds then firsts, fitter to foment
then raise a faction) or his own Janizaries, or the Persian, or
the Tartarian, or some other obscure Prince not as yet come
into play in the World, shall have the lustre from God to maul
this great Empire. It is more then enough for any man to set
down the fate of a single soul; much more to resolve the doom
of a whole nation when it shall be, These things we leave to
Providence to work, and posteritie to behold: As for our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
let us sooner expect the dissolutions of our own Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cosmes,
then the confusion of this Empire: For neither are our
own sins yet truly repented of, to have this punishment removed
from us; nor the Turks wickednesse yet come to full ripenesse,
to have this great judgement laid upon them.</p>
