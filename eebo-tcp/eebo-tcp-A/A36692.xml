            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO
The Right Honourable
JOHN
LORD HAVGHTON.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I first design'd this Play I found or thought
I found somewhat so moving in the serious part
of it, and so pleasant in the Comick, as might
deserve a more than ordinary Care in both: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
I us'd the best of my endeavour,
in the management of two Plots, so very different from each other,
that it was not perhaps the Tallent of every Writer, to have made
them of a piece. Neither have I attempted other Playes of the
same nature, in my opinion, with the same Iudgment; though with
like success. And though many Poets may suspect themselves for
the fondness and partiality of Parents to their youngest Children, yet
I hope I may stand exempted from this Rule, because I know my self
too well to be ever satisfied with my own Conceptions, which have
seldom reach'd to those <hi>Idea</hi>'s that I had within me: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
I presume I may have liberty to judge when I write more
or less pardonably, as an ordinary Markes-man may know certainly
when he shoots less wide at what he aymes. Besides, the Care and
Pains I have bestowed on this beyond my other Tragi-comedies may
reasonably make the World conclude, that either I can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
tolerably, or that this Poem is not much amiss. Few good
Pictures have been finish'd at one sitting; neither can a true just
Play, which is to bear the Test of Ages, be produc'd at a heat, or
by the force of fancie, without the maturity of judgment. For
my own part, I have both so just a Diffidence of my self, and
so great a Reverence for my Audience, that I dare venture no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:59689:3"/>
without a strict Examination; and am as much asham'd to
put a loose indigested Play upon the Publick, as I should be to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
brass money in a Payment: For though it shou'd be taken, (as
it is too often on the Stage,) yet it will be found in the second tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
And a judicious Reader will discover in his Closset that trashy
stuffe, whose glittering deceiv'd him in the action. I have often
heard the Stationer sighing in his shop, and wishing for those hands
to take off his melancholy bargain which clapp'd its Performance
on the Stage. In a Play-house every thing contributes to impose
upon the Iudgment; the Lights, the Scenes, the Habits, and,
above all, the Grace of Action, which is commonly the best where
there is the most need of it, surprize the Audience, and cast a
mist upon their Vnderstandings; not unlike the cunning of a Iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gler,
who is always staring us in the face, and overwhelming us
with gibberish, onely that he may gain the opportunity of making
the cleaner conveyance of his Trick. But these false Beauties of
the Stage are no more lasting than a Rainbow; when the Actor
ceases to shine upon them, when he guilds them no longer with his
reflection, they vanish in a twinkling. I have sometimes wonder'd,
in the reading, what was become of those glaring Colours which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd
me in <hi>Bussy Damboys</hi> upon the Theatre: but when I had
taken up what I suppos'd, a fallen Star, I found I had been co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen'd
with a Ielly: nothing but a cold dull mass, which glitter'd
no longer than it was shooting: A dwarfish thought dress'd up in
gigantick words, repetition in aboundance, looseness of expression,
and gross Hyperboles; the Sense of one line expanded prodigiously
into ten: and, to sum up all, uncorrect English, and a hideous mingle
of false Poetry and true Nonsense; or, at best, a scantling of wit
which lay gasping for life, and groaning beneath a Heap of Rubbish.
A famous modern Poet us'd to sacrifice every year a <hi>Statius</hi> to <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi>'s
Manes: and I have Indignation enough to burn a <hi>D'amboys</hi>
annually to the memory of <hi>Johnson.</hi> But now, My Lord, I am
sensible, perhaps too late, that I have gone too far: for I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
some Verses of my own <hi>Maximin</hi> and <hi>Almanzor</hi> which cry, Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
upon me for their Extravagance, and which I wish heartily
in the same fire with <hi>Statius</hi> and <hi>Chapman:</hi> All I can say for
those passages, which are I hope not many, is, that I knew they were
bad enough to please, even when I writ them: But I repent of them
amongst my Sins: and if any of their fellows intrude by chance into
my present Writings, I draw a stroke over all those <hi>Dalilahs</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:59689:3"/>
the Theatre; and am resolv'd I will settle my self no reputation by
the applause of fools. 'Tis not that I am mortified to all ambition,
but I scorn as much to take it from half-witted Iudges, as I shou'd
to raise an Estate by cheating of Bubbles. Neither do I discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the lofty style in Tragedy which is naturally pompous and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent:
but nothing is truly sublime that is not just and proper.
If the Ancients had judg'd by the same measures which a common
Reader takes, they had concluded <hi>Statius</hi> to have written higher
than <hi>Virgil:</hi> for,
<q>Quae superimposito moles geminata Colosso,</q>
carries a more thundring kind of sound than,
<q>Tityre tu patulae recubans sub tegmine fagi:</q>
Yet <hi>Virgil</hi> had all the Majesty of a lawfull Prince; and <hi>Statius</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the blustring of a Tyrant. But when men affect a Vertue which
they cannot reach, they fall into a Vice, which bears the nearest
resemblance to it. Thus an injudicious Poet who aims at Loftiness
runs easily into the swelling puffie style, because it looks like Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
I remember, when I was a Boy, I thought inimitable <hi>Spencer</hi>
a mean Poet in comparison of <hi>Sylvester</hi>'s <hi>Dubartas:</hi> and was rapt
into an ecstasie when I read these lines:
<q>
                  <l>Now, when the Winter's keener breath began</l>
                  <l>To Chrystallize the Baltick Ocean;</l>
                  <l>To glaze the Lakes, to bridle up the Floods,</l>
                  <l>And periwig with Snow the bald pate Woods:</l>
               </q>
I am much deceiv'd if this be not abominable fustian, that is,
thoughts and words ill sorted, and without the least relation to
each other: yet I dare not answer for an Audience, that they wou'd
not clap it on the Stage: so little value there is to be given to the
common cry, that nothing but Madness can please Mad-men, and a
Poet must be of a piece with the Spectators, to gain a reputation
with them. But, as in a room, contriv'd for State, the height
of the roof shou'd bear a proportion to the Area; so, in the Height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of Poetry, the strength and vehemence of Figures shou'd be
suited to the Occasion, the Subject, and the Persons. All beyond
this is monstrous; 'tis out of nature, 'tis an excrescence, and not a
living part of Poetry. I had not said thus much, if some young
Gallants, who pretend to Criticism, had not told me that this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi-comedy
wanted the dignity of style: but as a man who is charg'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with a Crime of which he thinks himself innocent, is apt to be too
eager in his own defence, so perhaps I have vindicated my Play
<pb facs="tcp:59689:4"/>
with more partiality than I ought, or than such a trifle can deserve.
Yet, whatever beauties it may want, 'tis free at least from the
grosness of those faults I mention'd: What Credit it has gain'd
upon the Stage, I value no farther than in reference to my Profit,
and the satisfaction I had in seeing it represented with all the justness
and gracefulness of Action. But as 'tis my Interest to please my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
so 'tis my Ambition to be read; that I am sure is the more
lasting and the nobler Design: for the propriety of thoughts and
words, which are the hidden beauties of a Play, are but confus'dly
judg'd in the vehemence of Action: All things are there beheld, as
in a hasty motion, where the objects onely glide before the Eye and
disappear. The most discerning Critick can judge no more of these
silent graces in the Action, than he who rides Post through an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Countrey can distinguish the scituation of places, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the soyle. The purity of phrase, the clearness of concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and expression, the boldness maintain'd to Majesty, the significan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and sound of words, not strain'd into bombast, but justly eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
in short, those very words and thoughts which cannot be
chang'd but for the worse, must of necessity escape our transient view
upon the Theatre: and yet without all these a Play may take. For
if either the Story move us, or the Actor help the lameness of it
with his performance, or now and then a glittering beam of wit or
passion strike through the obscurity of the Poem, any of these are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to effect a present liking, but not to fix a lasting admiration;
for nothing but Truth can long continue; and Time is the surest
Iudge of Truth. I am not vain enough to think I have left no faults
in this, which that touchstone will not discover; neither indeed is it
possible to avoid them in a Play of this nature. There are evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
two Actions in it: But it will be clear to any judicious man, that
with half the pains I could have rais'd a Play from either of them:
for this time I satisfied my own humour, which was to tack two
Plays together; and to break a rule for the pleasure of variety. The
truth is, the Audience are grown weary of continu'd melancholy Scenes:
and I dare venture to prophesie, that few Tragedies except those in
Verse shall succeed in this Age, if they are not lighten'd with a course of
mirth. For the Feast is too dull and solemn without the Fiddles. But
how difficult a task this is, will soon be try'd: for a several Genius is
requir'd to either way; and without both of 'em, a man, in my opinion,
is but half a Poet for the Stage. Neither is it so trivial an underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
to make a Tragedy end happily; for 'tis more difficult to save
<pb facs="tcp:59689:4"/>
than 'tis to kill. The Dagger and the Cup of Poison are alwaies in
a readiness; but to bring the Action to the last extremity, and then
by probable means to recover all, will require the Art and Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Writer; and cost him many a pang in the performance.</p>
            <p>And now, My Lord, I must confess that what I have written
looks more like a Preface than a Dedication; and truly it was thus
far my design, that I might entertain you with somewhat in my own
Art which might be more worthy of a noble mind, than the stale
exploded Trick of fulsome Panegyricks. 'Tis difficult to write justly
on any thing, but almost impossible in Praise. I shall therefore
wave so nice a subject; and onely tell you, that in recommending a
Protestant Play to a Protestant Patron, as I doe my self an Honour,
so I do your Noble Family a right, who have been alwaies eminent in
the support and favour of our Religion and Liberties. And if the
promises of your Youth, your Education at home, and your Experience
abroad, deceive me not, the Principles you have embrac'd are such as

in the minds of all true <hi>English-men,</hi> and renew their lustre in your

                  <p>Marry, because you make us Lay-men of the Tribe of
<hi>Issachar:</hi> you make Asses of us, to bear your burthens: when
we are young, you put Paniers upon us, with your Church dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline;
and, when we are grown up, you load us with a Wife:
after that, you procure for other men, and then you load our
Wives too; a fine phrase you have amongst you to draw us into
Marriage, you call it Settling of a man; just as when a fellow has
got a sound Knock upon the head, they say he's settled: Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
is a Settling blow indeed. They say every thing in the World

                  <p>No! the t'other old Gentleman in black shall take me if
I do! I will speak first! nay, I will, Fryar! for all your <hi>Verbum
Sacerdotis,</hi> I'll speak truth in few words, and then you may come
afterwards, and lye by the clock as you use to doe. For, let me
tell you, Gentlemen, he shall lye and forswear himself with any
Fryar in all <hi>Spain:</hi> that's a bold word now—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dom.</speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gom.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, I say, in the first place, that I and all men are marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for our Sins, and that our Wives are a Judgement; that a Batch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elour cobler
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59689:58"/>
is a happier man than a Prince in Wedlock; that we
are all visited with a Houshold Plague, and, <hi>Lord have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us</hi> should be written on all our doors.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dom.</speaker>
                  <p>Now he reviles Marriage which is one of the seven bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gom.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis liker one of the seven deadly Sins: but make your
best on't, I care not: 'tis but binding a man Neck and Heels for all
that! But as for my Wife, that <hi>Crocodile</hi> of <hi>Nilus,</hi> she has wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and traiterously conspir'd the Cuckoldom of me her anointed
Sovereign Lord: and, with the help of the aforesaid Fryar, whom
Heaven confound, and, with the Limbs of one Colonel <hi>Hernando,</hi>
Cuckold-maker of this City, devilishly contriv'd to steal herself
away, and under her Arm feloniously to bear one Casket of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,
Pearls, and other Jewels, to the Value of 30000 Pistols.

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dom.</speaker>
                  <p>False and scandalous! Give me the Book. I'll take my

                  <speaker>Dom.</speaker>
                  <p>As I was walking in the Streets, telling my Beads, and
praying to my self, according to my usual custom, I heard a foul
Out-cry before <hi>Gomez</hi> his Portal; and his Wife, my Penitent,
making dolefull Lamentations: Thereupon, making what haste
my Limbs would suffer me, that are crippl'd with often kneeling,
I saw him Spurning and Fisting her most unmercifully; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, using Christian Arguments with him to desist, he fell vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
upon me, without respect to my Sacerdotal Orders, pusht
me from him, and turn'd me about with a Finger and a Thumb,
just as a Man would set up a Top. Mercy, quoth I. Damme,
quoth he. And still continued Labouring me, till a good minded
Colonel came by, whom, as Heaven shall save me, I had never
seen before.</p>

                  <p>Ay, and, O Lady! O Lady too! I redouble my Oath,
I had never seen him. Well, this Noble Colonel, like a true Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
was for taking the weaker part you may be sure—where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
this <hi>Gomez</hi> flew upon him like a Dragon, got him down,
the Devil being strong in him, and gave him Bastinado on Bastina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,
and Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

prostrate, suffered with a most Christian Patience.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gom.</speaker>
                  <p>Who? he meek? I'm sure I quake at the very thought of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59689:59"/>
him; why, he's as fierce as <hi>Rhodomont,</hi> he made Assault and Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
upon my Person, beat me into all the colours of the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow.
And every word this abominable Priest has utter'd is as
false as the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> But if you want a thorough pac'd Lyar that
will swear through thick and thin, commend me to a Fryar.</p>

            <head>EPILOGUE,
By a Friend of the Author's.</head>
            <l>THere's none I'am sure, who is a Friend to Love,</l>
            <l>But will our Fryar's Character approve:</l>
            <l>The ablest Spark among you sometimes needs</l>
            <l>Such pious help for charitable Deeds.</l>
            <l>Our Church, alas! (as <hi>Rome</hi> objects) does want</l>
            <l>These Ghostly Comforts for the falling Saint:</l>
            <l>This gains them their Whore-Converts, and may be</l>
            <l>One Reason of the Growth of Popery.</l>
            <l>So <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Religion came in fashion,</l>
            <l>By the large leave it gave to Fornication.</l>
            <l>Fear not the guilt, if you can pay for't well,</l>
            <l>There is no Dives in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hell.</l>
            <l>Gold opens the strait gate, and lets him in;</l>
            <l>But want of money is a mortal sin.</l>
            <l>For all besides you may discount to Heaven,</l>
            <l>And drop a Bead to keep the Tallies even.</l>
            <l>How are men cozen'd still with shows of good!</l>
            <l>The Baud's best Mask is the grave Fryar's Hood.</l>
            <l>Though Vice no more a Clergy-man displeases,</l>
            <l>Than Doctors can be thought to hate Diseases:</l>
            <l>'Tis by your living ill that they live well,</l>
            <l>By your Debauches their fat Paunches swell.</l>
            <l>'Tis a mock-war between the Priest and Devil,</l>
            <l>When they think fit, they can be very civil.</l>
            <l>As some who did <hi>French</hi> Counsels most advance,</l>
            <l>To blind the World, have rail'd in Print at <hi>France.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Thus do the Clergy at your Vices bawl,</l>
            <l>That with more ease they may engross them all.</l>
            <l>By damning yours, they do their own maintain.</l>
            <l>A Church-man's godliness is alwaies gain.</l>
            <l>Hence to their Prince they will superiour be;</l>
            <l>And civil Treason grows Church-Loyalty:</l>
            <l>They boast the gift of Heaven is in their power;</l>
            <l>Well may they give the God they can devour.</l>
            <l>Still to the sick and dead their claims they lay;</l>
            <l>For 'tis on Carrion that the Vermin prey.</l>
            <l>Nor have they less Dominion on our Life,</l>
            <l>They trot the Husband, and they pace the Wife.</l>
            <l>Rouze up you Cuckolds of the Northern climes,</l>
            <l>And learn from <hi>Sweden</hi> to prevent such crimes.</l>
            <l>Vnman the Fryar, And leave the holy Drone</l>
            <l>To hum in his forsaken Hive alone;</l>
            <l>He'll work no Honey when his sting is gone.</l>
            <l>Your Wives and Daughters soon will leave the Cells,</l>
            <l>When they have lost the sound of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Bells.</l>
