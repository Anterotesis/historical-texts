         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough weakneſs and diſtance have prohibited me that converſe with you which ſometime I did enjoy, yet have they not excuſſed your former Kindeneſs out of my Remembrance. Received Benefits ſhould not Die before us: If the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor kill them not by Retraction, the Receiver muſt not ſuffocate them by Oblivion; nor prove their Grave, who was intended for a Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, if not a Garden where they may be Root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and be fruitfull. In thoſe hearts where Benefits Live, the Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Liveth. And thoſe that Live in our Eſtimation and Affection, we deſire their Names may be inſcribed on our Monuments, and ſurvive with ours, when we are Dead. While we live alſo we more regard their Judgements of us, then other mens; and are more ambitious of ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right in their eſteem; and therefore are willing that our juſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies may be in their hands, to hinder miſapprehenſions, and reſiſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Accuſers. May theſe Reaſons excuſe my prefixing your Name to theſe Papers, and directing them firſt to your Hand: (Cuſtom having led me into that Road, wherein I do not unwillingly follow.) It is not
<pb facs="tcp:55369:4"/>
for Protection or Patronage of my Opinions: For that I referre them wholly to the Father of Lights, the Illuminating Spirit, and the Light of that Truth which they contain and Vindicate. Nor do I deſire that you ſhould make theſe things your Studies; they being more fitted to the uſe of thoſe Students, that can lay out much of their time on ſuch things. I confeſs I had rather ſee in your Hands, the Holy Scriptures, and Books of Practical Divinity, then theſe Controverſies: and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hear ſuch Practical Diſcourſes from your Mouth. So farre am I from ſoliciting you to any ſingular Opinion of mine, that I ſolicit you not once to read theſe Books; ſave onely when any Opinion in them ſhall be Accuſed, to turn to the Words, and ſee what is ſaid. It is the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Chriſtian that holds faſt the Truth, which many eager Diſputers ſoon loſe. Doting about Queſtions that engender ſtrife, is not the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſneſs that God approves; What ever the Profeſſours of this Age may imagine. It is the moſt Practical Teachers and People in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> commonly that are the moſt Orthodox. I have oft noted many mens Prayers to be much freer from Libertiniſm, then their Sermons; and their Sermons then their Writings and Diſputes. That's a mans Judgement indeed, which he dare reduce to Practice, and own before God.</p>
            <p>The Work of theſe Papers have been to my minde ſomewhat like thoſe ſad Employments wherein I attended you: of themſelves, grievous and ungratefull; exaſperating others, and not pleaſing my ſelf (beſides the ruinating of my bodily health) And as the Remembrance of thoſe years is ſo little delightfull to me, that I look back upon them as the ſaddeſt part of my life; ſo the Review of this Apologie, is but the renewing of my trouble: to think of our Common frailty and darkneſs, and what Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and much valued Brethren I contradict; but eſpecially for fear leſt men ſhould make this Colliſion an occaſion of Diviſion, and by receiving the ſparks into Combuſtible Affections, ſhould turn that to a Conflagrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I intended but for Illumination. If you ſay, I ſhould then have let it alone: The ſame anſwer muſt ſerve, as in the former Cauſe we were wont to uſe. Some ſay, that I who pretend ſo much for Peace, ſhould not write of Controverſies. For my ſelf it is not much Matter: but must Gods Truth (for ſuch I take it) ſtand as a Butt for every man to ſhoot at? Muſt there be ſuch Liberty of oppoſing it, and none of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending? One party cannot have Peace without the others Conſent. To be Buffeted and Aſſaulted, and Commanded to Deliver up the Truth of God, and called <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npeaceable if I defend it and reſiſt, this is ſuch Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:55369:4"/>
as we were wont to finde. In a word, both works were ungratefull to me, and are ſo in the Review; but in both, as Providence and mens on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet impoſed a Neceſſity, and drove me to that ſtrait, that I must Defend or do worſe; ſo did the ſame Providence ſo clear my way, and draw me on, and ſweeten unuſual Troubles with unuſual Mercies, and Iſſue all in Teſtimonies of Grace, that as I had great mixtures of Comfort with Sorrow in the Performance, ſo have I in the Review: And as I had more eminent Deliverances and other Mercies in thoſe years and wayes of Bloud and Dolour, then in moſt of my Life beſide; ſo have I had more encouraging Light ſince I was engaged in theſe Controverſies. (For I ſpeak not of theſe few Papers onely, but of many more of the like Nature that have taken up my time.) And as I ſtill retain'd a Hope, that the End of all our Calamities and ſtrange Diſpoſings of Providence, would be ſomewhat Better then was Threatned of late: ſo Experience hath taught me to think, that the Iſſue of my moſt ungratefull Labours ſhall not be vain; but that Providence which extracted them hath ſome uſe to make of them, better then I am yet aware of; if not in this Age, yet in times to come. The beſt is, we now draw no bloud: and honeſt hearts will not take themſelves wounded, with that blow which is given onely to their Errours. However, God muſt be ſerved when he cals for it, though by the harſheſt and moſt unpleaſing work. Onely the Lord teach us to watch carefully over our Deceitfull Hearts, leaſt we ſhould ſerve our ſelves while we think and ſay, we are ſerving him; and leſt we ſhould Militate for our own Honour and Intereſt, when we pretend to do it for his Truth and Glory!</p>
            <p>I hope, Sir, the Diverſity of Opinions in theſe dayes, will not dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh your Eſtimation of Chriſtianity, nor make you ſuspect that all is Doubtfull, becauſe ſo much is Doubted of. Though the Tempter ſeems to be playing ſuch a Game in the world, God will go beyond him, and turn that to Illuſtration and Confirmation, which he intended for Confuſion and Extirpation of the Truth. You know its no news to hear of ſome Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, Proud and Licentious, of what Religion ſoever they be. And this Trinity is the Creator of Hereſies. And as for the ſober and Godly, it is but in leſſer things that they diſagree: and moſtly about words and Methods more then Matter (though the ſmalleſt things of God are not Contemptible.) He that wonders to ſee wiſe men differ, doth but wonder that they are yet Imperfect, and know but in part; that is, that they are yet Mortal ſinners, and not Glorified on Earth! And ſuch wonderers know not what man is, and it ſeems are too great ſtrangers to themſelves.
<pb facs="tcp:55369:5"/>
And if they turn theſe differences to the prejudice of Gods Truth, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonour of Godlineſs, they ſhew themſelves yet more unreaſonable; to blame the Sunne that men are purblinde. And indeed were Pride and Paſſion laid aſide in our Diſputes, and men could gently ſuffer contradiction, and heartily love and correſpond with thoſe that in lower matters do gainſay them, I ſee not but ſuch friendly debates might edifie.</p>
            <p>For your ſelf, Sir, as you were a friend to ſound Doctrine, to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and to Piety, and to the Preachers, Defenders and Practiſers thereof, while I converſt with you, and as fame informeth us, have continued ſuch; ſo I hope that God who hath ſo long preſerved you, will preſerve you to the end; and he that hath been your Shield in corporal dangers, will be ſo in ſpirituall.</p>
            <p>Your great Warfare is not yet accompliſhed: The Worms of Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that breed in our bowels, will live in ſome meaſure till we die our ſelves. Your Conqueſt of your ſelf is yet Imperfect. To fight with your ſelf, you will finde the hardeſt, but moſt neceſſary Conflict that ever yet you were engaged in; and to overcome your ſelf the moſt honourable and gainfull Victory. And think not that your greateſt trials are all over. Proſperity hath its peculiar Temptations, by which it hath foiled many that ſtood unſhaken in the ſtorms of adverſity. The Tempter who hath had you on the waves, will now aſſault you in the calm; and hath his laſt game to play on the Mountain, till nature cauſe you to deſcend. Stand this Charge and you win the day. To which, as one that is faithful to you, I ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you in a few words, what his temptations are like to be, and how you ſhould reſiſt them: If you are already provided, a Remembrancer will do you no harm.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> The firſt and great Aſſault will be, to entice you to Overvalue your preſent Proſperity, and to Judge the Creature to be better then it is, and to graſp after a fulneſs of Honour and Wealth, and then to ſay, <hi>Soul, take thy Reſt.</hi> As you love your Peace, your Life, your Soul, your God, take heed of this. Judge of Proſperity as one that muſt go Naked out of the world: Eſteem of earthly Greatneſs and Glory as that which will ſhortly leave you in the duſt. Why ſhould it be proper to Dying men to be Wiſe, and to Judge truly of this world, when all the living undoubtedly know that they muſt Die?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> At leaſt the Tempter will perſwade with you to enjoy your Proſperity to the ſatisfying of your fleſh; and tell you that the free uſe of the Creatures is your Chriſtian Liberty, and therefore you need not deny your ſelves thoſe Delights that God affordeth you.

If ever you would have your ſoul Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, make no <hi>proviſion for the fleſh to ſatisfie its luſts:</hi> A better man then any of us, was fain to tame his body and bring it into ſubjection. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is a neceſſary, but much neglected part of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>

               <hi>3.</hi> Should the Tempter prevail in theſe, it would follow, that God would be much forgotten, former Engagements violated, and the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things of the Life to come would be ſeldom thought on, and leſs eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. O think on him that remembred you in your greatest ſtraits! Its a provoking ſin to break thoſe Engagements which depth of Extremity, or Greatneſs of Deliverance, did formerly conſtrain us to make with our God! Ingratitude makes a forfeiture of all we have. And think not well of your own heart, when you cannot think more ſweetly of another world then of this. Its unhappy proſperity that makes God to be more ſleighted, and the Glory to come more unſavoury to our thoughts, and makes us ſay, <hi>It is beſt to be here.</hi>

            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> Another dangerous Temptation that will attend theſe, will be, to diſregard Chriſts Intereſt through an over-minding of their own: To play your own game, and lay out your chiefeſt care for your ſelf, and make Gods buſineſs to ſtoop unto your own. Where this prevails, the hearts of ſuch are falſe to Christ: While they pretend to ſerve him, they do but ſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon him. They will honour Chriſt no longer then he will honour them. And when they are once falſe to Chriſt, they can be true to no one elſe. Their friends are eſteemed but as ſtepping ſtones to their Ends. When they can ſerve them no longer they reject them as unprofitable. Ever Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that man ſtands ſafeſt that eſpouſeth no Intereſt contradictory to Chriſts; I had almoſt ſaid, None but Chriſts: For even Chriſts muſt be made his own, and then his own will be Chriſts. God is more engaged to ſecure his own Intereſt then ours. There is no Policy therefore comparable to this, to Engage moſt deeply where Chriſts chiefeſt Intereſt lieth, and to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite our own to his, in a just ſubordination. He that will needs have a ſtanding divided from Chriſt, Independent on him, or Equal with him, much more in Oppoſition to him, is ſure to fall. It will break the greateſt Prince on Earth to eſpouſe an Intereſt inconſiſtent with Chriſts, when he doth but ariſe to plead his Cauſe. Study therefore where Chriſts Intereſt moſt lieth, and then devote all your own to the promoting of it: and hold none that lives not as the Vine on the Wall, or rather as the branch in the Vine, in Dependance upon his. And upon Enquiry you will finde, that
<pb facs="tcp:55369:6"/>
Chriſts Intereſt lies much in theſe two things, the Piety and the Peace of his People. The Reformation of his Churches, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niting of them (at home and abroad) are the greateſt works that any can be Imployed in. To which ends Gods chiefeſt means, is an Able, Godly, Diligent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, to Teach and Rule his flocks according to his Word. All the Intereſt that God hath Given you, he expecteth ſhould be ſpeedily, diligently and undeſervedly imployed to theſe Ends. Delay not, you have but your time. Think it not enough to do no harm, or no more good then thoſe below you. Your ſtanding is unſafe when you do little or nothing for God. He is not bound to hold you the Candle to do nothing, or to work for your ſelf. <hi>Work therefore while it is day: the night comes when none can work.</hi>

               <hi>5.</hi> Another Temptation that you muſt expect, will be, to have your minde ſwell with your Condition: and to diſreſpect the inferiour ſort of your Brethren. But I hope the Lord will keep you ſmall in your own eyes; as remembring that you are the ſame in the eyes of your Judge, and your ſhadow is not lengthened by your ſucceſſes, and that you muſt lie down with the Vulgar in the common duſt.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O ſweet a thing is Chriſtian Love and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and ſo precious are the thoughts of Peace to my Soul, that I think it unmeet in this contentious Age, to publiſh ſuch a Controverſie as this, without an Apology: which, its likely, may be needful, both as to the Matter and the Manner. Not that I dare rather chooſe to Excuſe a fault, then to forbear the committing of it: But that I would have the Reader judge of things as they are. Juſt Apologies are not a cover to our faults, but for removal of miſ-repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and healing of miſapprehenſions, that thoſe may not be taken for faults which are none, or thoſe to be of the greater ſize, which are but ordinary infirmities. Whether my Apology be Juſt, the Reader muſt judge.</p>
                  <p>I do ſo heartily Love Peace, that I have hard thoughts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie: yet do I ſo Love the Truth, that I refuſe not to contend for it. Though the ſtrait be great, yet its no other then we are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally put to, even in lower things. The moſt noble and excellent ends, may have ſome diſtaſtful means: which as none that is in his right ſenſes will chooſe for themſelves, ſo none but a ſlave to his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes will refuſe when they are neceſſary. It is no Contradiction in ſuch a caſe, but true Diſcretion, to Chooſe the thing which at the ſame time we do Abhor: To chooſe it as a neceſſary Means, and yet to abhorre it for its Ungrateful Nature. We are contented to ſeek, and buy, and take that Phyſick which we ſo abhorre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we have much ado to get it down or to retain it. The Lord knows, that contending is diſtaſtful to my ſoul: though my corrupt nature is too
<pb facs="tcp:55369:11"/>
prone to it. Much ſtudying of Controverſies hath oft diſcompoſed my minde, and interrupted my more ſweet and heavenly thoughts, and unfitted me for publick and private duties; ſo that I as ſenſibly finde my ſelf a loſer by it, as by ſome other avocations of a more aliene nature. Yet dare I not be ſo ſelfiſh as to caſt it off. That muſt be endured, which may not be deſired. We may not pretend the diſadvantages to our ſouls (much leſs any lower) againſt apparent duty, and ſervice to the truth of God. Many wayes hath our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to make us a full reparation for our loſſes. What then ſhall I reſolve on? Neither to Delight in Controverſie; nor totally to Refuſe it. Not to ruſh upon it unadviſedly, nor to be carried into it by blinde Paſſion and partiality, nor yet to caſt away my Captains Colours, nor to draw back when I am preſt. Not to militate for any Faction, but for the Faith; nor for vain-glory and credit, but for Chriſt: And this with ſuch a differencing the Perſon from the Cauſe, that as it reſpecteth the errour, it ſhall be bitter and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; but as to my Brother, it ſhall be a Conference of Love. I abhorre almoſt nothing more in Divines, then laying too much upon the ſmaller controvertible Doctrinals, and making too much of our Religion to conſiſt in curious and unneceſſary ſpeculations, if not unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, unrevealed things; contradicting one of their firſt Maxims, that [<hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy is a Practical Science.</hi>] An honeſt Philoſopher ſaw the evil of this <note n="*" rend="inter">

                  <p>It is about five years ſince I wrote a ſmall book about Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and being in great weakneſs and expectation of death, I was forced to deliberate, Whether to publiſh it with its many Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or not at all? I choſe the former, ſuppoſing the Defects and Crudities would be charged only on the Author, and that ſome Light might notwithſtanding appear to the Reader, which might further him in the underſtanding of ſeveral truths. I durſt not ſo far value reputation, as to be injurious to Verity, for fear of diſcovering my own infirmity: Its no time to be ſolicitous about the eſteem of men,
<pb facs="tcp:55369:11"/>
when we are drawing near to the Judgement Seat of God. When this Book came abroad, it fell under very different Cenſures, as moſt things uſe to do that ſeem to go out of the ordinary road. Too many overvalued it: Some were offended at it. Hereupon being afraid leſt by Ignorance or Raſhneſs I ſhould wrong the Church and Truth, I did in the end of my Book of Baptiſm, deſire my Brethrens ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions and advice: which accordingly many of the moſt pious and Learned men that I know in the Land, were pleaſed to afford me; and that with ſo much Ingenuity, Love and Gentleneſs, as I muſt needs confeſs my ſelf their Debtor, as having no way deſerved ſo great a favour: and I do hereby return them my moſt hearty thanks. After this my Reverend and Dear Brother M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Blake</hi> in a Treatiſe of the Covenants, did publiſh a Confutation of ſome things in my Book (among many others whom he deals with, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Powell,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Firmin,</hi> &amp;c.) wherein I found nothing but tenderneſs and brotherly Love, as to my perſon; and no ſuch inclination to extreams in his Doctrine, as I found in ſome others; but much Moderation and Sobriety, as indeed the Gravity, Piety and Integrity of the man, would promiſe to any that know him. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I thought it might have been more convenient to him, to me, and to others, if I had ſeen his exceptions before they had been publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſo having known what I would reply, he might have publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed only ſo much as he remained unſatisfied in. But as it ſeems, his Judgement was otherwiſe, ſo is it no whit to me offenſive. Yet when I had read his Book, it was my Reſolution, to ſend him privately my Reply, that ſo we might conſider how farre we were agreed, and how farre the difference was onely ſeeming and about words, and might publiſh only the remainder to the world, by joynt Conſent. The Reaſons of this Reſolution were theſe: Firſt, Becauſe I was loath by tedious altercations, to hinder the Reader from diſcerning the Truth: It is the courſe of moſt voluminous Diſputers, to tire their Readers with Contendings about words, that they can hardly finde out the true ſtate of the Controverſie; much leſs diſcern on which ſide is the Truth. Which might be much remedied if men would but lovingly firſt debate the matter in private, and cut off all the ſuperfluities and verbal Quarrels; and then put out only the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial differences by joynt Conſent, having Corrected even in the language and manner of debating, whatſoever was diſpleaſing or ſeemed injurious to either party. Secondly, Becauſe I unfeignedly abhorre contending, and never wrote any thing that way, but when
<pb facs="tcp:55369:12"/>
I was unavoidably neceſſitated. Thirdly, Becauſe I ſo well know my own frailty, and proneneſs to be over-eager and keen, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly in my ſtile, and the frailty of moſt Brethren in being Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient hereof; yea of many in judging themſelves wronged when they are not, and making ſome plain ſpeeches which were but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary or innocent, to ſeem proud, contemptuous, and ſleighting as to mens perſons, racking them to a ſenſe that was never intended, I therefore thought it ſafeſt to avoid all occaſions of ſuch miſtakes, which may be injurious to themſelves, as well as to me. Fourthly, Becauſe the Lord hath of late years by a ſtrange, unreſiſtible work of his power, faſtned in my ſoul ſo deep an Apprehenſion of the Evil of Diſſentions, and of the Excellency and Neceſſity of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Brethren, and the Peace of the Church; and in order here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, of the healing of our Diviſions, that it ſticks in my thoughts night and day, and the Zeal of ſuch a Reconciliation doth eat me up; ſo that I make it the main ſtudy and buſineſs of my Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which way I might do any thing towards its accompliſhment. And I was much afraid, leſt if I wrote by way of Controverſie, I might, by exaſperating my Brethren, hinder this happy work. He that knoweth my heart, knoweth that theſe were my thoughts. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I did in the firſt Page ſignifie to M. <hi>Blake,</hi> this my Reſolution, which when I was forced to alter, I would not alter the words of my writing, but having given this account of the reaſon of them, I ſhall let them go as I wrote them.</p>
                  <p>Before I had finiſhed my Reply to Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> comes out Mr. <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi>'s Book againſt M. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> with his Digreſſion againſt me: After-this, I was informed of divers others that were ready to write againſt my Doctrine, and ſome that had written, and were ready to publiſh it, and divers others that were deſirous to ſend me their Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions. I did therefore apprehend (and ſo did many learned Friends) an unavoidable Neceſſity of appearing more publickly, both to ſpare my Friends the labour of writing the ſame things to me over and over, which ſo many others had written before; and to ſpare my ſelf the time and pains of endleſs private Replies (which have this three years taken me up, and hindered me from more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable work:) and alſo to prevent mens publication of more ſuch writings as have already been publiſhed; ſeeing when none know what I can ſay againſt them, the reſt may go on in the way as theſe have done, and trouble themſelves and the world in vain. Beſides, I underſtood that ſome were offended at my ſilence, as miſ-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
<pb facs="tcp:55369:12"/>
it to be from contempt. Being therefore neceſſitated to do ſomething of this kinde, I could not (according to the Laws of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice or Friendſhip) deal publickly with any, but thoſe that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to deal publickly with me. Its true, there hath been long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwered, a Book of Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> againſt ſome things which I had wrote which concerned him. But I never thought fit (nor yet do) to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to that: 1. Partly becauſe it containeth ſo little matter of reall difference between him and me (and moſt of that is anſwered by Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> and in my Reply to Mr. <hi>Kendall:</hi>) The main Points be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Whether Chriſt ſuffered the ſame which the Law threatned, or the Value, or that which was equivalent? (wherein he yieldeth as much as I need) and, Whether the Covenant be Conditional? and, Whether the Obligation to Puniſhment be diſſolved before we Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, ſinned, or were born? And to vindicate the Truth in theſe two or three Points, I conceive it not ſo meet a way, to do it in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that Book, wherein ten times more words would be beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in altercations, and upon the by. 2. Beſides, I was never ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver neceſſitated to a Reply to that Book, nor once deſired, and I will do nothing of that kinde, which I know how to avoid. 3. But indeed my greateſt reaſon, was the conſciouſneſs of my temerity in being ſo fooliſhly drawn to begin with him; and the conſciouſneſs of my fault in one or two unmannerly words of him, and conſequently the conſciouſneſs of my duty to be firſt ſilent. It is not fit that I ſhould both begin and end. But theſe Brethren that I here Reply to, did begin with me.</p>
                  <p>Upon theſe Reaſons, I ſent not my papers to Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to publiſh them, with my Reply to Mr. <hi>K.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for Mr. <hi>K.</hi> himſelf, I know not the man; but by his writings he appears to be a Learned man: And I will hope his humility may be anſwerable to his Learning, though he here expreſs it not: We are all poor frail ſinners; and above all do hardly Maſter our Pride; the fire whereof in an unmortified ſoul, doth make fewell to it ſelf of Gods excellent Gifts, till it have turned them all into ſalt and aſhes. That which this Learned man hath troubled himſelf to write concerning my ſelf, I will not inſiſt on: It is not for my ſelf that I am diſputing, but for the Truth, ſo farre as I know it: I can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to <hi>Hierom, Obſecro te per manſuetudinem Chriſti, ut ſi te laeſi, dimittas mihi; nec me viciſſim laedendo malum pro malo reddas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Laedes enim ſi mihi tacueris errorem meum, quem forte invene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris in Scriptis, vel in dictis meis.

                     <hi>A ſolemn Profeſſion of his diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Juſt hand of heaven, and the ſpirit of ſlumber on Mr.</hi> Goodwin, <hi>and the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous diſplay of his folly, to appear moſt ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>even daring to [adore the hand of God in infatuating his parts, that</hi> Balaams <hi>Aſs may ſee the hand of the Angel againſt the Prophet</hi>] with more of the like.

When I read ſuch paſſages as theſe in him, I began to think, how well I had ſped, and <hi>tantum non,</hi> did owe him thanks for handling me ſo gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, even in thoſe paſſages that others moſt blamed.

                  <p n="2">2. As for the Manner of my handling theſe Controverſies (which is the next thing that (more) needeth an Apology,) I expect to be blamed for theſe three things: 1. For unprofitable Altercations and Repetitions. 2. For too much curioſity and obſcurity in ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions. 3. For too courſe and ſharp a ſtile.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the firſt, I knew not how to avoid it, without inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I muſt follow the leading of them that I reply to. I muſt not digreſs too farre, to fetch in more uſefull matter then they put into my hands. Yet I think I have done ſomewhat in that kinde, as far as I ſaw fit. And when the ſame words of theirs, require the ſame anſwers, I am forced ſometime to repeat them, where the occaſion is repeated. Yet I can promiſe the Reader that I will not go near ſo far in this way of repetition, as more learned diſputants do, and in particular Dr. <hi>Twiſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the ſecond Exception, I muſt ſay, that many are miſtaken in my way, in that they diſcern not the difference, 1. Between Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary diſtinguiſhing and unneceſſary. 2. Between Curioſity in the main Cauſe, and in the Means of diſcuſſing it. 3. Between curious Notions that are thruſt on the Church and poor ignorant people, as Neceſſary and Certain; and ſuch as we are forced to uſe with Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men to diſcover their miſtakes, and to expugne curioſity of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or Uncertainty, by exactneſs of indagation, and as curious an explication of the Truth. I am ſomewhat confident that my curious diſtinguiſhing (as ſome call it) is but of the later ſort, in all theſe reſpects. For example, In the preſent Controverſie about the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentality of faith to Juſtification, that which offendeth me is, that Divines ſhould be ſo dangerouſly curious, as to make a Logical Notion of ſuch Neceſſity, which Gods Word never uſed, nor for ought I know, the Church for many a hundred year; and which poor people cannot comprehend: Yea and that they may lay ſo much of the difference between us and the Papiſts on this point,
<pb facs="tcp:55369:14"/>
thereby moſt dangerouſly hardening them, when they ſhall diſcover our Errour; and occaſion them to triumph over us, and to think, that the reſt of our Doctrine is like this? And that this Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality is ſtill ſo contradiſtinguiſhed from Merit, as if there were no third way of Faiths Intereſt in our Juſtification, but it muſt needs be the one or the other. Yea and the moſt Learned in the upſhot flie to this, that <hi>Credere</hi> is not <hi>Agere,</hi> but <hi>Pati,</hi> and is but <hi>Actio Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matica,</hi> or the name of Action, but Phyſically or hyperphyſically a ſuffering. Is not here a curious Doctrine of Faith and Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? If <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had been a Chriſtian he could not have comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it: Much more is it too fine for vulgar wits (as well as too falſe for lovers of the Truth.) In oppoſition to this, and in compaſſion of plain Chriſtians, I only ſay, that faith is the Condition of our Juſtification; or that the reaſon why we are Juſtified by it (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing its Object, and its Aptitude) is, becauſe the Free Donor, Law-giver and Juſtifier will have it ſo, and hath deſigned it to this Office in his Promiſe or Teſtament. I think this is plain Doctrine, and fit for plain men. There's ſcarce the ſimpleſt man in the Town, if one offer him the Soveraigns pardon for Rebellion, on Condition he will thankfully Accept it, and promiſe to Rebell no more, but he knows this to be the reaſon why his Acceptance hath an Intereſt in his pardoning (<hi>viz.</hi> as the fitteſt Condition freely determined on by the Soveraign) without any more ado. And I think to reade him a Logick Lecture about Active or Paſſive Inſtrumentality, would more abuſe then enlighten his underſtanding. Yet the ſubtilties of thoſe whom I oppoſe, doth force me oft to diſtinguiſh, to expugne their Sophiſtry: and I am forced to uſe more accurate means to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend a plain Truth. And indeed, he that Defineth and Diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well teacheth well. Confuſion is the Mother and Nurſe of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Truth loves the Light. It is not ſound Diſtinction that I blame in any, but fancies and vain curioſities, and carrying us from Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Words, and making an appearance of difference, where there is none, and calling Confuſion by the name of diſtinction or explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I am ſure a few obvious Diſtinctions, have been a Key to let many a truth into my underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>Moreover I muſt deſire the Reader to conſider, when things ſeem too curious to him, and hard to be underſtood, whether it be not from the Nature of the ſubject matter, rather then from any unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Curioſity in me: If the matter be ſuch as will bear no more familiar and plain enodations and explications, I cannot help that.

I am too conſcious of my frailty, to think my ſelf innocent in this. I confeſſed my fault as to one even now; and I confeſs as to another (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Walker</hi>) I committed the ſame fault, by too unmannerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking expreſſions (Though I will take none for a competent Judge of the degree of my fault, that hath not read his Anſwer to <hi>J.

                     <hi>Gatakers</hi> Vindication of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Wottons</hi> Defence.) The other paſſages that ſome accuſe me of, are, I think, upon a forced miſtaken ſenſe of my words. The moſt real ſharpneſs that ever I was guilty of, was againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Tombes</hi> in my Book of Baptiſm: and its too probable that in this againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>K.</hi> I have tranſgreſſed: which if I have done, I heartily deſire him, as I do all other Brethren whom I have offended, in compaſſion of humane frailty, to remit it; as I heartily do all thoſe paſſages of his, which his Readers do generally judge ſo unſavoury. However I do adjure every Reader, that would not break the ninth Commandment, and wrong God and themſelves and me by falſe cenſures, that they impute not my ſharp expreſſions to a diſeſteem of Chriſtian Unity and Peace, or a hatred to my Brother: and that by too impatient reception, they make it not an occaſion of diſaffection, or breach of peace in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For the Lord knows, that, though my words may be too rough and earneſt, yet my ſoul longeth after the Unity and Peace of the Church. And I never yet wrote againſt any Brother ſo ſharply, but I could heartily live with him in dear Love and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; as I am confident I ſhould do with theſe, if they were near me: For ſure I am, I diſagree not with thoſe with whom I do converſe; nor ever fell out with any Brother, to my remembrance, ſince I was a childe. Charge me with unmeet expreſſions if you pleaſe; but with no further Unpeaceableneſs, Diſaffection, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb facs="tcp:55369:15"/>
of my Brethren, then you can prove. 2. I muſt intreat the Reader to diſtinguiſh carefully, between my ſpeeches againſt the Perſon, and againſt the Errour or Cauſe which I oppoſe. I confeſs, when I am confident that it is Errour that I ſpeak againſt, eſpecially if it appear to be foul or dangerous, I am apt to ſhame it, and load it with Abſurdities, and ſhew the nakedneſs of it to the Reader: In this caſe, I finde many take it as if I ſpoke all this of the Perſon, and cenſured him as abſurd, as I do his Opinion: which is an injurious charge; ſeeing a wiſe man may hold an abſurd Opinion. And I think, as I muſt not ſpeak contemptuouſly of my Brother for a leſſer Errour, ſo neither muſt I for his ſake, ſpeak lightly and favourably of his faults. Errour is not like confeſſed ſins, which none dare own, or encourage others in: but it is a Vice that diſpoſeth men to Infect all they can; and emboldneth them to defend it, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly to draw all others into the guilt. And therefore it needeth the moſt potent oppoſition, and the ſouls of our Brethren need the moſt effectual preſervative: And that muſt not be only by a naked, dull Confutation; but alſo by a diſcovery of the foulneſs, the ſinfulnes and dangerouſneſs of the Errour. The Affections have need to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked, as well as the Underſtanding informed, in the preſent caſe, as well as againſt common moral Vices. I am ſure Seducers make no ſmall advantage, by moving the Affections, and why they that ſpeak Truth ſhould not do ſo, I cannot tell. If we muſt do ſo in Preaching, ſo muſt we in ſome Diſputings, ſtill ſuppoſing that Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation go firſt, and exciting application be but ſubſervient, and be not the leading, or the principall part. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>oſe that take intellectuall Errour to be no ſinne, muſt deny the underſtanding to be under a Law, and its acts to be <hi>participativè</hi> voluntary, and being comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Will. And if Errour be ſinne, we may have leave to diſgrace it and deal with it as ſinne; provided that we maintain our Charity to the erring Brother. I am bound not to hate my Brother in my heart, but plainly to Rebuke him, and not ſuffer ſin to reſt upon him. If he take it ill, that makes not me the offendor, nor will diſcharge me from my duty. 3. I confeſs I think we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly too tender ear'd in ſuch caſes: of which I have ſpoken my minde already in the end of the Preface to my Book of Baptiſm. I have oft wondered to think what patience we expect (and juſtly) yea and finde, in many of the worſt of our hearers, when we ſpeak to them as cuttingly as poſſibly we can (and all too little:) and how
<pb facs="tcp:55369:15"/>
little we exerciſe or can allow to one another! and what ſilken ears the Preachers of humility have themſelves? And I cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſtrange partiality of the beſt: how zealous they are againſt a Toleration of Errours; and yet how impatient of being told of their own. Other mens ſhould be cut down with the Sword, and theirs may not be plainly confuted by the Word: nor can we ſo skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Not that I am free from the ſame diſeaſe: but (though proud hearers judge him a proud ſpeaker that deals plainly with them, yet) I can truly ſay of that ſin, to the praiſe of my Phyſition, as <hi>Seneca Epiſt.</hi> 8. <hi>Salutares admonitiones velut medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camentorum utilium compoſitiones litteris mando, eſſe illas efficaces in meis ulceribus expertus: quae etiamſi perſanata non ſunt, ſerpere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſierunt.

But I remember how they reprehended <hi>Beatus Rhenanus</hi> for his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed coveteouſneſs, <hi>Beatus eſt Beatus: attamen ſibi.</hi> So are ſuch Brethren charitable, <hi>ſibi &amp; ſuis.</hi> And all this comes <hi>a ſtudio par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> and becauſe the Doctrine of the Unity of Chriſts Body, and the Communion of Saints (as Saints) is not reduced to practice; and we love not men ſo much for being of the ſame Body, as for being of the ſame Side or Party with us; nor for being in the ſame Chriſt, as for being of the ſame Opinion. If he that knows Chriſt knows all things; and if Intereſt in Chriſt alone be enough to make us Happy; then is it enough to make our Brother Amiable; though ſtill we may be allowed the diſlike of his faults.</p>
                  <p>Which ſide the Truth lies on, in the Points here debated, I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly leave the Reader to judge according to the evidence that ſhall appear to him in the peruſal. I deſire no more of him, but Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, Impartiality, and Patience in his ſtudying it: And I again intreat my Brethren to believe that I write this in an unfained Love

of Peace and them: and that accordingly they will receive it: and where they meet with any of the effects of my infirmity, which may ſeem provoking and injurious to them, they will compaſſionately remit them; remembring that Heaven will ſhortly Reconcile our differences.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Reverend and dearly beloved Brother, I remember that when I met you laſt at <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> you told me that you had ſent to the Preſſe a Treatiſe of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,</hi> and deſired me not to be offended, if you pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in it ſome things againſt my Judgement: Your Treatiſe is ſince come to my hands, and upon a brief peruſall of ſome part of it, I am bold to let you know this much of my thoughts, 1. That I very much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and honour your Learned Labours, and had I been M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Vines</hi> or M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Fiſher,</hi> I might rather have given (in ſome reſpects) a higher commendations of your Book: And eſpecially I love it for its ſound diſcoveries of the Vanity of the Antinomians. 2. So farre am I from being offended at your Writing againſt my Writings, that (as I have oft ſaid concerning M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Owen,</hi> ſince I ſaw his Book againſt me, even ſo do I by you) I never honoured you ſo much (though much) nor loved you ſo dearly (though dearly) before as ſince; for I ſee more of your worth then I ſaw before. For where I erre, why ſhould I be offended with any brother for lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Gods Truth and mens ſouls, above my Errours, or any ſeeming Reputation of mine that may be ingaged in them, and for ſeeking to cure the hurt that I have done? God forbid that I ſhould ſeek to maintain a Reputation obtained by, or held in an oppoſition to the Truth. I take all my Errors in Theology (even in the higheſt revealed points, <hi>participaliter</hi>) to be my ſinnes; but eſpecially my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged Errors: And I take him for my beſt friend, that is the greateſt enemy to my ſins. And where I erre not, I have little cauſe for my own ſake to be offended at your oppoſition. For as you are pleaſed to honour me too highly both in your Epithetes and tender dealing, yea in being at ſo much pains with any thing of mine, and in ſtooping to a publick oppoſition of that which you might have thought more worthy of your contempt, ſo I know you did it in a zeal for God and Truth, and you thought all was Error that you oppoſed; ſo that in the general we fight under one Maſter, and for one Cauſe, and againſt one Enemy: You are for Chriſt, 1. For Truth and againſt Errors, ſo farre as you know it, and ſo am I. I know you wrote not againſt Me, but againſt my Errors, reall or ſuppoſed. And truly, though I would not be ſhameleſſe or impenitent, nor go ſo far as <hi>Seneca,</hi> to ſay we ſhould not object a common fault to ſingular perſons (<hi>Vid. Cor. de Irâ, l.</hi> 3. c. 26. p. <hi>(mihi)</hi> 452. no more then to reproach a Blackmore with his colour; yet I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55369:20"/>
ſee ſo much by the moſt Learned and Judicious, to aſſure me that <hi>humanum eſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare,</hi> and that we know but in part, that I take it for no more diſhonour, to have the world know that I erre, then for them to know that I am one of their Brethren, a ſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> and not yet arrived at that bleſſed ſtate where that which is childiſh ſhall ceaſe, and all that is imperfect ſhall be done away. Only if my Errors be greater then ordinary, I muſt be humbled more then ordinary, as knowing that my ſin is the cauſe that I have no greater illumination of the Spirit. I have truly publiſhed to the world my indignation againſt the proud indignation of thoſe men, that account him their enemy that ſhall publiquely contradict them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Yet muſt I needs tell you, that in the points which you contradict, I finde no great alteration upon my underſtanding by your Writings; whether it be from the want of evidence of truth in your Confutation, or through the dulneſſe of my Apprehenſion, I hope I ſhall better be able to judge, when I have heard from you next. I think I may ſafely ſay, It is not from an unwillingneſs to know the Truth. And one further difference there is in our Judgements: For my Judgement is, that it is not ſo convenient nor ſafe a way to publiſh ſuddenly a reply to your oppoſition, as to tell you my thoughts privately (ſeeing we live ſo near) and to bring the Points in difference by friendly collations to as narrow a compaſs as we can, and make as clear a diſcovery of each others meanings as may be; and then by joynt conſent to tell the world our ſeveral Judgements, and our Reaſons, as lovers of the Truth and of each other; that ſo others may have the benefit of our friendly Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Enquiries; and may be thereby advantaged for the more facile diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Truth. Truly I would have all ſuch Controverſies ſo handled, that all the vain altercations might lye in the duſt in our ſtudies, and that which is publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed might be in one Volume friendly ſubſcribed by both parties. In this I perceive by your practiſe, your Judgement differs from mine; and that you rather judge it fitteſt to ſpeak firſt by the Preſſe, that the world may hear us. I crave your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of theſe Papers, rather in this private way, and that you will ſignifie to me in what way I ſhall expect your return, wherein I think it fitter you pleaſe your ſelf then me. I ſhall faithfully give you an account of the effect of your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on my weak underſtanding; but not in the order as they lye in your Book, but I will begin with thoſe Points which I judge to be of greateſt moment.</p>

                     <p>IT is alſo true that faith accepts Chriſt as a Lord, as well as a Saviour: But it is the Acceptation of him as a Saviour, not as a Lord, that Juſtifies: Chriſt Rules his People as a King, Teacheth them as a Prophet, but makes Atonement for them only as a Prieſt, by giving himſelf in Sacrifice, his blood for Remiſſion of ſins: Theſe muſt be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but not divided: Faith hath an eye at all, the blood of Chriſt, the command of Chriſt, the doctrine of Chriſt, but as it lies and faſtens on his blood, ſo it Juſtifies. He is ſet out a propitiation through faith in his blood, <hi>Rom. 3.24.</hi> not through faith in his command. It is the blood of Chriſt that cleanſeth all ſin, and not the Soveraignty of Chriſt. Theſe confuſions of the diſtinct parts of Chriſts Mediatorſhip, and the ſpeciall offices of faith may not be ſuffered. Scripture aſſignes each its particular place and work; Soveraignty doth not cleanſe us; nor doth blood command us: Faith in his blood, not faith yielding to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty doth Juſtifie us.</p>

                        <hi>R. B.</hi> THis is a Point of ſo great moment in my eyes, that I reſolve to begin with it. I doubt not but the difference between you and me is only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the bare methodizing of our Notions, and not <hi>de Subſtantia rei:</hi> But I doubt leſt your doctrine being received by common heads, according to the true impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of your expreſſions, may do more againſt their ſalvation then is yet well thought on: And that not <hi>per accidens,</hi> but from its proper nature; ſuppoſing the impreſſion of the ſoul to be but anſwerable to the objective doctrinal ſeal. I am no friend to the confuſion that you here ſpeak againſt; and I am glad to find you ſo little in love with it, as to paſs your judgement that it is not to be ſuffered: For now I reſt aſſured that you will not be offended, when here or hereafter, I ſhall open your guiltineſs of it; and that you will not be unwilling of what may tend to your cure. Theſe two or three neceſſary diſtinctions I muſt firſt here premiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I can give a clear anſwer to your words.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I diſtinguiſh ſtill between conſtitutive Juſtification or Remiſſion by the Goſpel grant or Covenant, called by moſt <hi>Juſtificatio Juris,</hi> and Juſtification <hi>per ſententiam Judicis.</hi> 2. I diſtinguiſh between conſtitutive Legal Juſtification as begun, and as continued or conſummate. 3. Between the Phyſical operation of Chriſt and his Benefits on the intellect of the Beleever <hi>per modum objecti apprehenſi,</hi> as an intelligible <hi>species</hi>; and the moral conveyance of Right to Chriſt and his Benefits, which is by an act of Law or Covenant-donation. 4. Between theſe two queſtions, What juſtifieth <hi>ex parte Chriſti?</hi> and What juſtifieth, or is required to our Juſtification <hi>ex parte peccatoris?</hi> 5. Between the true efficient cauſes of our Juſtification, and the meer condition, <hi>ſine qua non, &amp; cum quâ.</hi> 6. Between Chriſts Meriting mans Juſtification, and his actual juſtifying him, by conſtitution or ſentence.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon I will lay down what I maintain in theſe Propoſitions, which (ſome of them) ſhall ſpeak further then the preſent Point in Queſtion, for a preparation to what followeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. Chriſt did Merit our Juſtification (or a power to juſtifie) not as a King, but by ſatisfying the juſtice of God in the form of a ſervant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. Chriſt dotn juſtifie <hi>Constitutivè</hi> as King and Lord, <hi>viz. ut Dominus Redemptor,</hi> i. e. <hi>quoad valorem rei,</hi> he conferreth it, <hi>ut Dominus gratis benefaciens:</hi> but <hi>quoad modum conditionalem conferendi, ut Rector &amp; Benefactor.</hi> For it is Chriſts enacting the new Law or Covenant, by which he doth legally pardon or confer Remiſſion, and conſtitute us Righteous, ſuppoſing the condition performed on our part. And this is not an act of Chriſt as a Prieſt or Satisfier; but joyntly, <hi>ut Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor &amp; Rector.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. Chriſt doth juſtifie by ſentence, as he is Judge and King, and not as Prieſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. Sentential Juſtification, is the moſt full, compleat and eminent Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; that in Law being <hi>quoad ſententiam,</hi> but virtual Juſtification; though <hi>quoad constitutionem debiti &amp; relationis,</hi> it be actual Juſtification.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 5. Faith juſtifieth not by receiving Chriſt as an object which is to make a real impreſſion and mutation on the intellect, according to the nature of the <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:</hi> I ſay, To juſtifie, is not to make ſuch a real change: Though ſome joy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> with the Papiſts in this, and tell me, that as the Divine Attributes make their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55369:21"/>
moral Impreſſions on the ſoul according to their ſeveral natures, ſo do the ſatisfaction and merits of Chriſt, apprehended, procure comfort and joy, and a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying ſentence to be pronounced in the ſoul it ſelf: and ſo the apprehenſion of Chriſts Soverainty cauſeth our ſubjection (which laſt is true.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 6 Faith therefore can have no Phyſical Cauſation or Efficiency in juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying; ſeeing that the work to be done by us, is not <hi>noſmetipſos Justificare,</hi> in whole or in part, but only <hi>Jus acquirere ad Beneficium gratis ſed conditionaliter colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum:</hi> It is a Relative change that is made by Juſtification, and not a Real or Phyſical.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 7. The Legal, formal intereſt, or conducibility of Faith to our Juſtification, cannot therefore be any other then that of a Condition, in the proper Law-ſenſe, as the word [Condition] is uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>ſpecies</hi> of conditions which they call <hi>Voluntariae vel Poteſtativae,</hi> and not <hi>Caſuales vel Mixtae.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 8. Scripture doth not ſay (that I can finde) that Faith juſtifieth; but that <hi>we are juſtified by Faith:</hi> I therefore uſe the later phraſe rather then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, both becauſe it is ſafeſt to ſpeak with the Scripture, and becauſe the former ſpeech ſeemeth to import an Efficiency; but the later frequently imports no more then a meer condition. Yet I will not quarrell with any that ſpeaks otherwiſe, nor refuſe to ſpeak in their phraſe while I diſpute with them, as long as I firſt tell them my meaning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 9. Though, <hi>ex parte Chriſti,</hi> our ſeveral changes proceed from his ſeveral Benefits, and parts of his Office exerciſed for us; yet, <hi>ex parte noſtri,</hi> i.e. <hi>fidei,</hi> it is one entire apprehenſion or receiving of Chriſt as he is offered in the Goſpel, which is the Condition of our intereſt in Chriſt and his ſeveral Benefits; and the effect is not parcelled or diverſified or diſtinguiſhed from the ſeveral diſtinct reſpects that faith hath to its object. Chriſt meriteth Remiſſion for us as Satisfier of Juſtice; and he actually juſtifieth us as Benefactor King and Judge, and he teacheth us as Prophet, and ruleth us as King. The real mutations here on us, receive their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſification partly from our faith, becauſe there faith doth <hi>efficere</hi> or <hi>cauſare</hi>; As we learn of Chriſt becauſe we Beleeve him, or Take him for our Teacher: We obey him becauſe we Take him for our King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is not ſo with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of meer Right or Title to Chriſt and his Benefits. Faith doth not obtain Right to Remiſſion and Juſtification diſtinctly as it receiveth his Righteouſneſs, or himſelf as Prieſt; and ſo Right to the Priviledges of Chriſts Government, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly as it taketh him as King; nor Right to Adoption, as it taketh him as a Father; nor Right to Glory, as it taketh him as Glorifier: no more then all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour benefits (as Title to Magiſtracy, Miniſtry, Health, Houſe, Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) proceed and are diverſified by the divers aſpects of our faith on Chriſt. The true Reaſon of which is this; That Right to a benefit is the meer effect of the Gift (Donation) or Revealed Will of the Giver: And therefore no Act of the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath any more intereſt, or any other then it pleaſeth the Donor to aſſign or appoint it to have. So that <hi>(ſuppoſitâ actus naturâ)</hi> all the formall Civil intereſt comes from Gods meer Will, as Donor: (for to the Abſolute Benefactor doth it belong, as to conferre all Right to his freely-given Benefits, ſo to determine of the Time and Manner of Conveyance, and ſo of the Conditions on the Receivers part.) The nature of the Act of Faith is cauſed by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as Creator of the old and new Creature; I mean of our natural faculties, and their ſupernatural endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or diſpoſitions: And therefore this is preſuppoſed <hi>in ordine naturae</hi> to faiths Legal intereſt: As God is firſt the Maker of earth, before he is the Maker of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55369:21"/>
                        <hi>Adams</hi> body: Faith is to be conſidered as being Faith (<hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch acts exerciſed about ſuch objects) in order of nature, before it can be rightly conſidered as ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying or the condition of Juſtification: Seeing therefore it receives all its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Legal intereſt from God, as Legiſlator and Donor of Chriſt and his benefits, which is after its material aptitude <hi>ad hoc officium</hi>; its intereſt muſt not be gathered directly, <hi>ex natura actus,</hi> but <hi>ex conſtitutione donantis &amp; ordinantis:</hi> And therefore you muſt firſt prove out of the Goſpel, that <hi>It is the Ordination of God,</hi> that as Chriſts ſeveral actions have their ſeveral effects for us and on us, ſo our faith ſhall be the proper condition of each of theſe various effects, <hi>quâ apprehendit,</hi> as it Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth or Accepteth each diſtinct effect, or Chriſt diſtinctly as the cauſe of that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>&amp; etiam conſideratum in modo cauſandi.</hi> But, alas, how inviſible is the Proof of this in all your Writings? (I will leave the reſt of the Propoſitions, by which I intended here together to have opened ſome more of my ſenſe, till afterwards, becauſe I will not interrupt the preſent buſineſs.) Here, either my Underſtanding is too ſhallow to reach your ſenſe, or elſe you are guilty, <hi>quoad literam,</hi> of very great confuſion; (which one would think ſhould have befallen you at any time, rather then when you are blaming others of unſufferable confuſion:) and yet <hi>quoad ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum involutum,</hi> of more dangerous, unſcriptural, unproved Diſtinction.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Your expreſſions confound Chriſt and his Actions, with mans faith in our Juſtification: Or, theſe two Queſtions [By what are we juſtified <hi>ex parte Chriſti?</hi>] and [By what are we juſtified <hi>ex parte noſtri?</hi>]</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Your implied ſenſe, even the heart of your reaſoning, conſiſteth in this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that [As our Right, as to the ſeveral benefits received, is to be aſcribed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly to ſeveral diſtinct Cauſes on Chriſts part, ſo alſo as diſtinctly are the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Benefits, <hi>quoad Debitum vel Titulum,</hi> to be aſcribed to the ſeveral diſtinct apprehenſions of theſe Benefits (as moſt ſay) or of Chriſt as diverſly cauſing them (as ſome ſay.)] And here I cannot but complain of a treble injuſtice that you ſeem to me guilty of (even in this elaborate Treat, wherein you correct the Errors of ſo many others.)</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Againſt the Truth and Word of God, in implying it to have done that, even in the great Point, the Conſtitution of the Condition of Juſtification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is nor to be found done in all the Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Againſt the ſouls of men: 1. In ſuch nice mincing and cutting the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſalvation, to their great perplexity, if they receive your doctrine. 2. And alſo in not affording them one word of Scripture or Reaſon for the proof of it, which is injuſtice, when you are Confuting others and Rectifying the world in ſo great a Point. 3. Laſtly (and leaſtly) it is evident injuſtice to your Friend, to Accuſe him (for it is no hard matter to know whom you mean) with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the diſtinct parts of Chriſts Mediatorſhip, which he ſtill diſtinguiſheth as exactly as he can: though he do nor diſtribute as many offices to Faith, as there are objects for it, or as he doth to Chriſts ſeveral Works. Why did you not name one line where I do confound the parts of Chriſts Offices? I pray you do it for me in your next.</p>
                     <p>I will not trouble you much with Arguments for my opinion in this Point, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you meddle with none already laid down, and ſeeing I have done it over and over to others, and becauſe I am now but Anſwering to your Confutation. Only let me tell you, that the Proof lieth on your part. For when I have once proved, that God giveth Chriſt and his Benefits to man, on Condition he will Beleeve in Chriſt or Accept him: If you will now diſtinguiſh, and ſay, It is Accepting
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55369:22"/>
his ſatisfaction, which is the Condition of Juſtification, and Accepting him as King, which is the Condition of Sanctification or Glorification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you muſt prove this to be true. For <hi>non eſt diſtinguendum vel limitandum ubi Lex non diſtinguis vel limitat.</hi> If God ſay [Beleeve in the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved,] and you ſay, [Beleeving in him as Prieſt is the only Condition of ſaving thee from guilt: and Beleeving in him as King, is the only Condition of ſaving thee from the power of ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] you muſt prove this which you ſay. Or if you will not ſay [It is the only Condition] but [the only inſtrument] you give up the Cauſe. For the word [Condition] is it that expreſſeth its neereſt Legal Intereſt in juſtifying or conveying any Right: and that which you call its Inſtrumentality, is but the natural Aptitude and Remote Intereſt.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It is the Receiving of Chriſt as Chriſt that juſtifieth (as the Condition of Juſtification) But he is not received as Chriſt, if not as Lord-Redeemer.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Juſtifying faith is the Receiving of Chriſt as a full Saviour: But that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be except he be received as Lord. For to ſave from the power of ſin, is as true a part of the Saviours Office, as to ſave from the guilt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Juſtifying faith receiveth Chriſt as he juſtifieth us, or as he is to juſtifie us: But he doth juſtifie us as King and Judge and Benefactor; as he ſatisfieth and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riteth in the form of a ſervant under the Law.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. If receiving Chriſt as a Satisfier and Meriter, be the only faith that gives right to Juſtification, then on the ſame grounds you muſt ſay, It is the only faith that gives right to further Sanctification and to Glorification: For Chriſt Merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one as well as the other.</p>
                     <p n="6">6.

The reaſon of the conſequent is, becauſe unbelief condemneth (at leaſt partly) as it is the privation of the juſtifying faith: I ſpeak of that condemnation or peremptory ſentence which is proper to the new Law, and its peculiar condemning ſin, eminently ſo called.</p>

                     <p n="9">9. That faith which is the Condition of Salvation, is the Condition of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication or Remiſſion: But it is the receiving of Chriſt as King, as well as Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, that is the Condition of Salvation: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1.

Scripture no where makes our faith, or act of faith, the Condition of Juſtification, and another of Salvation. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily aſcribeth both to one. 4. When <hi>Paul</hi> argueth moſt zealouſly againſt Works and for Faith only, it is in reſpect to Salvation generally, and not to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication only. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>By grace ye are ſaved through faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Not of works, leſt

Never more was ſaid againſt Juſtification by Works (which <hi>Paul</hi> excludes) then againſt Salvation by them: Nor is it any more diſhonour to Chriſt that he ſhould give Juſtification or Remiſſion on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Accepting him as King, then that he ſhould give Salvation on that Condition. 5. Pardon of ſin and freedom from hell, muſt needs have the ſame Condition: For pardon reſpecteth the puniſhment as truly as the ſin. <hi>Pana &amp; Vaenia ſunt adverſa:</hi> Pardon diſſolveth guilt; Guilt is the obligation to puniſhment. Yet I ſpeak here only of a plenary and continued pardon.</p>

                        </gap>h nothing in it that ſo well deſerves the title of a Cauſe, as of a Condition: though unbelief may be ſaid to be the Cauſe of our Not-being juſtified, as ſuch cauſes are ſaid to move God, when we ſpeak according to the manner of men: Indeed if they will ſay (according to their principles) that <hi>Fides in Chriſtum Dominum quae eſt conditio non juſtificat per modum inſtrumenti</hi>; I ſhall grant it: But then 1.

We are juſtified by faith <hi>as</hi> the Condition of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: Therefore we are juſtified by every act of faith <hi>which</hi> is the Condition: For, <hi>A quatenus ad omne valet conſequentia.</hi> Thus I have given you a few of thoſe many reaſons which might be given, to prove that the Accepting of Chriſt for Lord-Redeemer, and not only as Satisfier, or not only his Righteouſneſs, is that Faith by which as a Condition we are juſtified. And what ſad effects it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to teach the world that the only juſtifying act of faith is, The Accepting of Juſtification as merited by Chriſts blood, or the Accepting of Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to juſtifie them; it is not hard for an unprejudiced man to diſcern. For my part, in all my experience of the caſe of the ungodly that I have trial of, I can finde no commoner cauſe of their general deluſion and perdition, then this very doctrine; which they have generally received, though not in ſuch exact terms a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> it is taught them. I never met with the moſt rebellious wretch (except now and then one under terrors) but when they have ſinned their worſt, they ſtill think to be ſaved, becauſe they believe: And what is their beleeving? why they beleeve that Chriſt died for them, and therefore God will forgive them, and they truſt for pardon and ſalvation to Chriſts death and Gods mercy: This were good, if this were not all; but if Chriſt were alſo received as their Sovereign and Sanctifier and Teacher: But if this were the only juſtifying act (as they uſually ſpeak) then I ſhould not know how to diſprove him that ſhould tell me that all men in the world ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that beleeve the Goſpel to be true: or at leaſt, the far greateſt part of the moſt wicked men: For I am certain that they are willing not to be damned, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Accept, or are Willing of Chriſt to ſave them from damnation: and I am ſure they are Willing to be pardoned as faſt as they ſin, and that is, to be juſtified: and therefore muſt needs be Willing of Chriſt to pardon them (ſuppoſing that they beleeve the Goſpel to be true) What therefore ſhall I ſay if a wicked wretch thus argue: He that hath the only juſtifying act of faith is juſtified: But that have I; for I Accept of Chriſt to forgive and juſtifie me by his blood: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Shall I tell him that he diſſembleth, and is not Willing? Why 1. Long may I ſo tell him before he will beleeve me, when he feels that I ſpeak falſly and ſlander him. 2. And I ſhould know that I ſlander him my ſelf: Suppoſing that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that there is no pardon but by Chriſts blood, (as the devils and many milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of wicked men do beleeve:) For I know no man in his wits can be willing to be unpardoned and to burn in hell. Shall I give him the common anſwer (the beſt that ever was given to me,) that though the only juſtifying act be the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt or his Righteouſneſs to juſtifie us, yet this muſt be ever accompanied with the receiving him as Sovereign, and a reſolution to obey him? Perhaps I may ſo puzzle him for want of Logick or Reaſon; but elſe how eaſily may he tell me, that this receiving Chriſt as Lord, hath either the nature of a <hi>medium ad fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> or not? If it be no <hi>medium,</hi> the want of it in this caſe cannot hinder the Juſtification of that man that is ſure he hath the ſole juſtifying act it ſelf: For as

Chriſt as Soveraign doth cleanſe us, both from the guilt and power of ſinne, by actual Remiſſion or Juſtification, and by Sanctification. 3. Suppoſe you ſpeak true, as you do, if you mean it only of Meriting our clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: What is this to our Queſtion?

                     <p>Suppoſe a Rebell be Condemned, and lye in priſon waiting for Execution; and the Kings Son being to raiſe an Army, buyeth this Rebell, with all his fellow priſoners, from the hand of Juſtice, and ſendeth to them this meſſage; If you will thankfully acknowledge my favours, and take me hereafter for your Prince or General, and liſt your ſelves under me, I will pardon you (or give you the pardon which I have purchaſed) and moreover will give you places of Honour and Profit in my Army:] Here now if the Queſtion be, What it is on the Princes part that doth deliver the priſoner? It is his ranſom, as to the Impetration or Preparation: and it is his free-Grant, which doth it, as to the actual Deliverance. If it be askt What is it that Honoureth or Enricheth him? It is the place of Honour and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that by the Prince is freely given him. But if you ask on the offenders part, What it is that delivereth him as the condition? It is not his accepting Pardon and Deliverance (or the Prince as a Pardoner or Ranſomer) that is the ſole Condition of his pardon and deliverance from death: Nor is it the Accepting of the Honour (or of the Prince as one to honour him) that is the ſole condition
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55369:24"/>
of his Honour: Nor is it accepting of Riches, that is the ſole condition of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching him. But it is entirely the accepting of the Prince for his General, and thankfull acknowledging his Ranſom, that is the Condition of all together, and hath as near an intereſt in one part of the Benefit, as another.</p>
                     <p>Or ſuppoſe the condemned priſoner be a woman, and the Prince having Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed her, doth ſend this offer to her, That if ſhe will thankfully acknowledge his favour, and take him for her Redeemer and Husband and Prince (to love, honour and obey him) he will deliver her, and make her his Queen, and ſhe ſhall partake of all his Honour and Riches.] Here now if the Queſtion be, What it is on his part that Redeemed her? What that Delivered her? What that honoured her? What that enriched her? each effect muſt be aſcribed to its proper cauſe, and the cauſes not confounded: And ſhe muſt diſtinctly apprehend, by what way and cauſe each priviledge comes. But if you ask only, What it is on her part that is the condition of enjoying theſe Benefits? Why it is but one entire, undivided Condition before mentioned: Will you here ſubtilly diſtinguiſh and ſay, that her taking him to deliver her, is the ſole act which is the condition of her Deliverance? and her taking him to Dignifie her, is the ſole condition of her Dignity? and her taking him as Rich, or to enrich her, is the ſole condition of her enriching? No, It is one undivided condition that equally gives her intereſt in all. Much leſs is it the Accepting of his Riches, that is the ſole condition of enriching her. Yet if any ſhould in one Queſtion include both, What on his part did ſave her from death? and what on her part? then it muſt be expreſt as <hi>Paul</hi> did in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned text, in our caſe: It is her Marrying or Accepting a Mercifull Redeemer. I ſhould wrong you, by ſeeming to imply a doubt of your Apprehenſiveneſs, if I ſhould ſpend words in application of this to our caſe. Having been ſo much too tedious already, I will only adde; That the common doctrine in this Point, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that there be as many acts of faith as there are Benefits from Chriſt to be received; and that each one is the Inſtrument of receiving that particular benefit: and ſo one act of faith Juſtifieth, another Adopteth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that act which receiveth Juſtification, which they call the Paſſive inſtrument thereof, in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of all their Diſputes they ſo deſcribe, that it is apparent they mean <hi>ipſam Juſtificationem paſſivam:</hi> And ſo with them <hi>Credere &amp; Juſtificari</hi> muſt be Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonimall termes: For ſo to receive Juſtification, is nothing but to be Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. Who knows whether you mean that [none of thoſe acts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. are acts of Juſtification] or [not all of them] The proper importance of your words is for the former. But that is a dangerous untruth: for <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. is judged by our Divines to contain a proper deſcription of juſtifying faith [they ſaw the promiſes (<hi>i. e.</hi> the good promiſed) a farre off, and were perſwaded of them, and embraced them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] But which ſoever you mean, you ſhould have proved your aſſertion. It will be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily acknowledged that many there mentioned, were not the great and principall act which is the Condition of Juſtification, as begun: But yet they may be leſſer acts which are ſecondary parts of the condition of continuing their Juſtification. I do not think but that act [by which <hi>Noah</hi> became the heir of the righteouſneſs which is by faith,] <hi>v.</hi> 7. had a hand in continuing his Juſtification, though it were the preparing the Ark, being moved with fear. I think that act by which <hi>Abel</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained witneſſe that he was righteous, and that by which <hi>Enoch</hi> pleaſed God, and without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe him, had ſome hand in Juſtification: I think theſe four great acts mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 6. are part of the condition of Juſtification. 1. To beleeve that God is (<hi>viz.</hi> that he is God, the Chief Good, the firſt and laſt, the principal efficient and Ultimate End, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) 2. The diligent ſeeking of him. 3. Beleeving that he is a rewarder of them that do ſo. 4. Coming to him. (If this be diſtinct from the ſecond.) When the holy Ghoſt doth of purpoſe in the whole Chapter ſet forth the glory and excellency of faith, I dare not be one that ſhall ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that he ſpeaks all this of a lower ſort of faith, and quite left out the nobleſt part which juſtifieth, from his praiſes.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Yet you ſhould not (in my judgement) have called [<hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſelf-denial, <hi>Gideons</hi> valour] acts of Juſtifying faith: Are theſe acts of faith? If you mean that theſe acts are fruits of faith, its true: Or if you mean that an act of faith did excite the ſoul to each of theſe acts, and ſo you mean not the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, valour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the act of faith which excited it, then you might call thoſe acts of juſtifying faith: But if I had called valour and obedience ſo, I ſhould have been blamed.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. What mean you to ſay Obedience and Valour was not their Juſtification? Do you think that any act of faith is Juſtification? You mean (if I may conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture from your after-doctrine) the inſtrument of Juſtification.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But then how come you to ſay next, that it is Chriſts blood?

                     <p n="6">6. But I thought the conteſt in your Diſpute had been, Which is the juſtifying act of faith, and which not? and therefore when you denied thoſe in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. to be acts of Juſtification (which I am forced to interpret [juſtifying acts]) I expected to finde the true act aſſerted; but in ſtead of that I finde the oppoſite member, is [The blood of Chriſt.] Is this indeed the Controverſie? Whether it be [Accepting Chriſt as Lord] or [the blood of Chriſt] that juſtifieth? Never was ſuch a Queſtion debated by me, in the way here intimated.

we are juſtified by faith too, as the condition of our intereſt in free Juſtification. And why ſhould theſe two be put in oppoſition? I lookt when you had aſſerted and well proved that it is not taking Chriſt as Lord, but only faith in his blood, that is the condition on our part, of our attaining Juſtification.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. It would prove a hard task to make good, that there are ſeveral acts of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith, by which we are not juſtified; without flying to great impropriety of ſpeech. By [juſtifying faith] you muſt mean, the Act, Habit, or renewed Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: If the act, then I think you will ſay, it is but one, or not many: Or at leaſt every act, which is juſtifying faith, muſt needs be ſuch as we are juſtified by: Or elſe why ſhould that act be called [juſtifying faith.] 2. But I doubt not but you mean the habit: And then 1. you confeſs that the habit is [juſtifying faith] which is true; not only as it helpeth to produce the act, but even as it is in it ſelf; But that will overthrow the doctrine of inſtrumentality. 2. It requireth another kinde of Diſputing then I here meet with, to prove that acts and habits of mans ſoul, are of ſo different a nature, that where the acts are ſpecifically diſtinct by the great diſtance and variety of objects, yet the habit producing all theſe is one and the ſame, and not diſtinct as the acts: and that obedience, ſelf-denial and valour, are acts of the ſame habit of faith, as is the accepting an offered Chriſt. 3. If you ſhould mean by [juſtifying faith] the faculty as ſanctified, then all other acts of that faculty as ſanctified, or of the Spirit there reſiding, might as well be called Acts of juſtifying faith. But I will not imagine that this is your ſenſe.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. is nothing to our buſineſs. <hi>Paul</hi> was not his own juſtifier: Though he knew not matter of condemnation (<hi>ſenſu Evangelico,</hi> for no doubt he knew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a ſinner) yet that did not juſtifie him, becauſe it is God only that is his Judge. Can you hence prove, that accepting Chriſt as Lord, is not the condition of our Juſtification? Then you may prove the ſame of the accepting him as Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. For <hi>Paul</hi> knew nothing by himſelf, as if he were guilty of not performing the one or the other: yet was he not thereby juſtified.</p>

It is ordinary to make the <hi>modus</hi> or quality of that matter which is the ſubſtance of the condition, to be as real a part of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the matter it ſelf. As when you oblige your Debtor to pay you ſo much cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Engliſh money; it is here as neceſſary that it be [Engliſh] and [Currant] as that it be money. If you promiſe your ſervant his wages, on condition he ſerve you faithfully: here [Faithfulneſs] is as real a part of the Condition, as [Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.] If a man take a woman in Marriage, and eſtate her in all his Lands, on condition that ſhe will be to him [a chaſt, faithfull Wife:] here her chaſt fidelity is as true a part of the condition, as to be his Wife. So if God ſay, [He that hath a Working faith ſhall be juſtified and ſaved, and he that hath not, ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.] Here as faith is the principall part of the condition, ſo that it be a [Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing] is the ſecondary, and as real a part of the condition, as that it be faith. And if Satan accuſe you for not-beleeving (at Judgement) you muſt be juſtified, by producing your faith it ſelf, ſo if he accuſe you as having a faith that was not Working; how will you be juſtified but by the Works or Working diſpoſition of that faith?</p>

                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:55369:26"/>5. As for your ſingle Argument here, I anſwer, 1. It is a weak ground to maintain that <hi>James</hi> twelve times in thirteen verſes, by [Works] means not [Works;] and by faith alone (which he ſtill oppoſeth) doth not mean faith alone, and all this becauſe you cannot ſee the connexion of one verſe to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or the force of one cited Scripture. Others may ſee it, and be able to ſhew ſenſe in the Apoſtles words, though you or I could not. If every time we are at a loſſe in analyſing or diſcerning the reaſon of a cited Text, we ſhall preſume to make ſo great an alteration, meerly to bring all to hang together in our apprehenſions, we ſhall finde Analyzers the greateſt corrupters of Scripture. It is eaſie to imagine and fain a falſe Analyſis with much plauſibleneſs.</p>
                     <p>I conceive that <hi>James</hi> citeth theſe words expoſitorily: <hi>q. d.</hi> [And thus or in this ſenſe the Scripture was fulfilled, <hi>i e.</hi> hiſtorically, ſpoke truly of that which was long before done, <hi>Abraham beleeved God, i. e.</hi> ſo as to ſecond his faith with actual obedience, <hi>and it (i. e.</hi> beleeving and ſo obeying, or truſting Gods promiſe and power ſo farre as to offer his ſon to death) <hi>was imputed to him,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Or why may not <hi>James</hi> by conceſſion preoccupate an objection? knowing that this would be objected he might ſay, <hi>q. d.</hi> I grant that the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but yet though he were initially juſtified by faith only, yet when he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to works, he was juſtified alſo by his obedience. 3. And is it not as hard to diſcern the reaſon of this citation, according to your expoſition as mine? For you may as well ſay, [How do theſe accord, He was juſtified by a working faith: and The Scripture was fulfilled which ſaith, He was juſtified by faith?] For <hi>James</hi> is not proving that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by faith, and yet this is it the Text ſpeaks: but that he was juſtified by works ſeconding faith, or, as you ſay, by a Working-faith: Where, if you put any emphaſis on the term [Working] and account it to ſuperadde any thing to meer beleeving, you ſay as much as I; and then <hi>James</hi> muſt cite that Text expoſitorily; and then whether according to my expoſition or yours, varies not the caſe, ſeeing one ſaith as much for Works as the other.</p>
                     <p>But I ſuppoſe you will ſay, Faith which juſtifieth muſt be working; but it ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth not <hi>qua operans. Anſ.</hi> 1. True: nor <hi>qua fides,</hi> i. e. <hi>quâ apprehendit objectum,</hi> if the <hi>quâ</hi> ſpeaks the formall reaſon of its intereſt in Juſtification. 2. But why cannot faith juſtifie unleſs it be working? If you ſay [Becauſe that God hath made it the condition of Juſtification, that we beleeve with a working faith] and ſo that it be working is part of the Condition, you ſay the ſame in ſenſe as I. If you ſay, either that working is neceſſary as a ſign, that faith is true; or that the nature of true faith will work; both are truth: but to ſay this is the Apoſtle's ſenſe, is to null all his Argumentation: For he pleads not for a meer neceſſity of ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication or diſcovery, but for a neceſſity <hi>ut medij ad Juſtificationem</hi>; even that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification which he cals [Impu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it is only as a condition that faith or its wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king nature can be neceſſary <hi>ad finem ut media moralia</hi>; if you ſpeak of ſuch an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity as the Text doth.</p>

For in the doctrine of Juſtification, ſay they, it is that they Fundamentally erre, and we Principally differ: And that in theſe four Points.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. About the formall cauſe of our Righteouſneſs, which, ſay theſe Divines, is the formall Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, as ſuffering and perfectly obeying for us (or as others adde, In the habitual Righteouſneſs of his humane nature; and others, The natural Righteouſneſs of the Divine nature.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. About the way and manner of our participation herein, which as to Gods act, they ſay is imputation (which is true) and that in this ſenſe, that <hi>Legaliter</hi> we are eſteemed to have fulfilled the Law in Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. About the nature of that faith which Juſtifieth, which, ſay moſt of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Reformers, is an aſſurance, or full perſwaſion of the pardon of my ſins by Chriſts blood.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. About the formal reaſon of faiths intereſt in Juſtification, which, ſay they, is as the inſtrument thereof.</p>
                     <p>I doubt not but all theſe four are great Errors. Yet for theſe muſt we contend as the Reformed Religion; and here muſt lye the difference between us and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. That which troubled me was this: To think how many thouſand might be confirmed in Popery by this courſe, and what a blow it gave to the Reformed Religion. For who can imagine but that the young Popiſh Students will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the reſt of their Religion, when they finde that we erre in theſe? and will judge by theſe of the reſt of our Doctrine? Eſpecially when they finde us ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this the main part of the Proteſtant Cauſe, what wonder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they judge our Cauſe naught? This is no fancy, nor any needleſs fears, but ſuch a real blow to the Proteſtant Cauſe, as will not eaſily be healed. Had Divines only in a way of freedom uſed this phraſe, and not made it ſo great a part of our Religion, to the hazarding of the whole, I had never mentioned the unſoundneſs or other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of it. Now to the thing it ſelf, Your Arguments for faiths inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality to Juſtification, I will conſider when I can finde them: You begin with (and ſay more for) faiths inſtrumentality in receiving Chriſt. You can ſay no more of me concerning this, but that [it will be ſcarce allowed to be ſo called.] This intimates that I make it no matter of contention: nor do I know how I could have ſaid leſs, if any thing; when its only the unfitneſs or impropriety of the phraſe that I mention, and not the ſenſe: which I thought with ſo much ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs I might do, upon reaſon given, it being no Scripture phraſe. If faith be the inſtrument of receiving Chriſt, then it is either the Act or the Habit of Faith that is the inſtrument: They that ſay, the Habit is the inſtrument, ſpeak not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, but far more tolerably then the others do. If gracious Habits are properly called inſtruments of the ſoul, then ſo may other Habits: And why is not this language more in uſe among Logicians? if it be ſo unqueſtionably proper? But I
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55369:27"/>
perceive it is the Act of faith that you call the inſtrument: for you anſwer only to what I ſay againſt that. I drew up a Scheme of the ſeveral ſorts of Giving and Receiving, in Anſwer to another Learned Brother: which, for the neceſſity of diſtinguiſhing here, I would have added, but that ſo operous a Reply would be unſutable to your brief Exceptions. Receiving ſtrictly taken is ever Paſſive: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in a Civil, Ethical, leſs proper ſenſe, is but the Act of accepting what is offered: When it is only a Relation, or <hi>Jus ad rem</hi> that is offered, Conſent or Acceptance is an act ſo neceſſary ordinarily to the poſſeſſion (or proper Paſſive reception) that it is therefore called Receiving it ſelf: yet is indeed no efficient cauſe of the Paſſive reception or poſſeſſion: but a <hi>conditio fine qua non,</hi> and a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective diſpoſition; and ſo makes the ſubject capable of the benefit: but being no efficient it can be no inſtrument. Yet ſtill I ſay, that if any will pleaſe to call it an inſtrument in this ſenſe, I will not quarrel with him, for the impropriety of a phraſe; ſpecially if ſome men had the ſame ingenuity as others have, that ſay, it is but <hi>inſtrumentum metaphoricum.</hi> But to ſay, that the act of faith is the inſtrument of Ethical Active reception (which is it that I argued againſt,) is to ſay, Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt is the inſtrument of it ſelf. Now let's ſee what you ſay to this. 1. You ſay, Its too ſubtill a Notion: That deſerves no Reply. 2. You ſay [We uſe to ſpeak otherwiſe of faith.] Thats no proof that you ſpeak properly. You ſay [Faith is the eye of the ſoul; and the eye is not ſight. Faith is the hand, <hi>&amp;c.] Anſ.</hi> 1. Strange proof! not only by Metaphors, but by metaphors of meer humane uſe. 2. Is the act of faith the eye of the ſoul as diſtinct from ſight? and the hand as diſtinct from receiving? Tell us then what actual ſeeing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving is? To ſpeak metaphors and contradictions is no proving your Aſſertion. Next you ſay [Scripture ſpeaks otherwiſe.] Thats to the purpoſe indeed, if true. You cite, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.26. where is no ſuch matter. If [By] ſignifie an inſtrumentall cauſe, It is either Alwaies or Sometimes: You would not ſure have your Reader believe that it is Alwaies. If but ſometimes, Why do you take it for granted that it ſo ſignifies here? Why did you not offer ſome proof? This is eaſie Diſputing. Next you ſay [Why elſe is this Righteouſneſs ſometime called the Righteouſneſs of faith? Sometimes the Righteouſneſs of God which is by faith; but that it is a Righteouſneſs which faith receives?] <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Its properer to ſay, <hi>Credens recipit cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo,</hi> The Believer by beleeving receives it: Then to ſay, Faith (eſpecially the act) receives it: But if you will uſe that ſpeech, it muſt expreſs but <hi>formalem rationem credendi</hi> expoſitorily, and not the efficiency of faith, and therefore no inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. It is the Righteouſneſs of God by faith, becauſe God gives it freely (Chriſt having merited it) upon condition of mans faith. You adde [<hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. Chriſt dwels in us by faith. By faith we take him in, <hi>&amp;c.] Anſ.</hi> You odly change the queſtion: We are ſpeaking of faiths inſtrumentality in receiving Right to Chriſt, or Chriſt in relation: and you go about to prove the reception of his Spirit, or graces really, or himſelf objectively: For Chriſt is ſaid to dwell in us, 1. By his Spirit and Graces. 2. Objectively, as my friend dwels in my heart when I love him. The text being meant of either of theſe, is nothing to the purpoſe. 2. Yet here you do not prove that [by] ſignifieth a proper inſtrument: no more then your actual intellection is ſaid to be the inſtrument of Truths abode in you; when it is ſaid that Truth dwelleth in you by intellection. The ſame Anſwer ſerves to your following words about receiving the Spirit. 1. Its nothing to our Queſtion. 2. You give us but your bare word that Scripture ſpeaks of faith as the ſouls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, even in receiving the Spirit of Chriſt, much leſs in receiving Right to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55369:28"/>
Chriſt. But ſtill remember that from firſt to laſt, I profeſs not to contend with any about the uſe of this phraſe, of faiths inſtrumentality in receiving Chriſt. It is its being really the proper inſtrumentall efficient cauſe of Juſtification, which I denied, and reſolvedly more then ever do deny. This you next come to, and ſay,</p>

THe inſtrumentality of it in the work of Juſtification is denied, becauſe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an Inſtrument (as conſidered in Phyſical operations) doth not exactly belong to it; which if it muſt be alwaies rigidly followed, will often put us to a ſtand in the aſſignation of cauſes of any kinde in Moral actions. The material and formal cauſes in Juſtification are ſcarce agreed upon, and no marvell then in caſe men minde to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend about it, that ſome queſtion is raiſed about the Instrument. But in caſe we ſhall conſider the nature and kinde of this work, about which faith is imploied, and examine the reaſon and ground, upon the which faith is diſabled from the office of an inſtrument in our Justification, and withall look into that which is brought in as an inſtrument in this work in the ſtead of it, I do not doubt but it will eaſily appear, that thoſe Divines, that with a concurrent judgement (without almoſt a diſſenting voice, have made faith an inſtrument in this work) ſpeak moſt aptly, and moſt agreeably to the nature of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument.</p>

                        <hi>R. B.</hi> BUt is this certain? Do I therefore deny faith to be the inſtrument of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, becauſe the nature of an inſtrument [as conſidered in Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal operations] doth not exactly belong to it? I ſaid 1. The action of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cauſe and of the inſtrument is one action. Is not this true of moral opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as well as Phyſical? If it be not, you muſt make us a new Logick before you can reaſonably expect that we receive your Logical Theology. 2. I ſaid, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument muſt have Influx to the producing of the effect of the principal cauſe, by a proper cauſality: that is, <hi>in ſuo genere.</hi> Is not this true of Moral operations as well as Phyſical? Its true, Moral cauſes may be ſaid to have a leſs proper cauſation then Phyſical: But 1. The inſtrumental muſt be as proper as that of the principal. 2. There is a wide difference between, <hi>cauſam Moralem,</hi> and <hi>cauſam Moralitatis. Effecti naturalis potest eſſe cauſa moralis, vel imputativa: Et effecti moralis ſcilicet Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci, (ut Debiti, Juris, Meriti,) poteſt eſſe cauſa remotior naturalis.</hi> It may well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a proper cauſation, when the effect is produced by as full a cauſation as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing will admit (as in relations that are by meer reſultancy.)</p>
                     <p n="2">2. You ſay [the material and formal cauſes of Juſtification are ſcarce agreed on.] But doth that give you a liberty to aſſert what you liſt, or what cannot be proved true, becauſe all men ſee not the truth? I ſhould have thought you ſhould rather have thus concluded: [Seeing Divines themſelves cannot agree about the aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of theſe Logical, unſcriptural notions in the buſineſs of Juſtification, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a meer Church-dividing courſe, to place ſo much of the Proteſtant Cauſe in ſuch notions, and inſiſt upon them as matters of ſuch neceſſity and weight, as is done in aſſerting faiths inſtrumentality to Juſtification.] Your argument (in the iſſue and tendency) is like that of plundering ſouldiers in time of fight; that ſay, Now they are altogether by the ears, we may take that we light on: why ſhould
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55369:28"/>
they queſtion us, till they agree among themſelves? 3. Whether this phraſe be ſo apt as you affirm, we ſhall better know when you have ſaid ſomething to prove it. If Divines have been ſo concurrent in it as you ſay, that there is ſcarce a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting voice, I hope I am the more excuſable, if it prove an error, for oppoſing it: For it is pity to let ſo many miſtake themſelves, miſlead others, and make us part of a new Religion.</p>
                     <p>But Sir, whats the cauſe of this ſudden change?

This I hope you will not down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right affirm: I deny it on this reaſon: Every abſolute Donor (I mean, who is abſolutely owner of what he gives) is the totall cauſe-efficient-principal, of his own Donation: But God in juſtifying is an abſolute Donor (giving remiſſion and Righteouſneſs) Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Or elſe God and man muſt be principal cauſes one ſubordinate to the other, and each total in his own kinde. This muſt be your meaning, by your firſt words: But then which of theſe is the moſt principal cauſe, and which the ſubordinate? It is hard for a better wit then mine to know your minde by your words: For when you ſay [Becauſe it is mans inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is alſo Gods inſtrument.] It may ſeem that you take it to be mans inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment firſt, or elſe how can it be therefore Gods inſtrument [becauſe] it is mans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But yet whether you ſpeak <hi>de ordine conſequentis vel conſequentiae, de ordine eſsendi &amp; efficiendi, vel de ordine dicendi &amp; colligendi,</hi> I know not. However, I will not be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable as to imagine that you take man for the moſt principal cauſe, and God for the ſubordinate; but contrarily. But then you do not only make man the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doner and juſtifier of himſelf, but you make him the neareſt total cauſe of it: and ſo it would be as proper to ſay, Man forgives himſelf, as that God forgives him: And ſo faith would be only mans inſtrument directly, as being the neareſt cauſe-principal; and Gods inſtrument remotely. As if I hold my pen, and you hold my hand, the pen is <hi>proximè</hi> my inſtrument, and <hi>remotiùs</hi> yours. And ſo God ſhould juſtifie and pardon man, by himſelf, as Gods inſtrument: As if a Judge had committed Treaſon, and the King ſhould give him authority to Judge, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Abſolve himſelf. But how much might be ſaid againſt this? To juſtifie <hi>efficienter</hi> is <hi>actus Rectoris: Sed homo non eſt rector ſui ipſius</hi> (in the ſenſe in hand:) Therefore he cannot juſtifie himſelf. Indeed if you had ſpoke only of the Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <hi>in ſoro conſcientiae</hi> you might well have aſcribed it to man as the efficient cauſe: but that you ſpeak not of.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The communication of Titles that you ſpeak of, is 1. very rare. 2. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain whether at all found in Scripture. That Text 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. ſeemeth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to leave out [the Church] as underſtood, then to communicate Chriſts Name to it: <hi>q. d.</hi> [So is Chriſt and the Church.] I would adviſe all friends of mine to take heed that they preſume not on this ſlight ground to communicate Chriſts Name to the Church in their ordinary ſpeech. 3. But who can tell what you mean by a communication of actions? Your putting [Communication of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons] in contradiſtinction from [Communication of Titles] makes the proper ſenſe of your words be, that Chriſt doth as really communicate actions themſelves, as he doth Titles themſelves. But that is no better then a plain impoſſibility: For the communication will make it another action. The accident periſheth, when ſeparated from its ſubject: and therefore the ſame accident cannot be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. But its like you intended to have ſaid, That there is a common or mutual attribution of each others actions, or one is entitled to the actions of the other; and ſo mean only a communication of the Name <hi>quoad modum producendi,</hi> and not of the actions themſelves. But then, either this is an improper figurative way of ſpeech; or it is proper, and grounded in the nature of the thing. If the former,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55369:30"/>
then it is nothing to our Queſtion, who are not enquiring whether there may not be found ſome Figure in Rhetorick according to which faith may be ſaid to be mans inſtrument of Juſtification and Gods? but whether it be ſo properly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed? And if you could finde any Scripture that ſo ſpeaks figuratively, calling faith mans inſtrument and Gods in juſtifying; (as you cannot) this would do nothing to the deciding of our Controverſie. It is therefore a grounded attributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that you muſt prove, where there is alſo a real inſtrumentality, and ſo the Name fitted to the Thing. And how prove you this? Why, as before, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. you ſay, [We beleeve and not Chriſt; yet faith is Chriſts inſtrument, whereby he takes up his abode.] But this is too facil diſputing to ſatisfie. 1. Here is not a word to prove that it is a relative In-dwelling that is here ſpoken of. I need not tell you how ſingular you are in this Expoſition (if you ſo expound: If not, you ſay nothing.) 2. If that had been proved, yet here is no proof that [by] ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth inſtrumentality. 3. Much leſs that it is Chriſts inſtrument. How eaſily are all theſe affirmed? I think Chriſt dwels in our hearts, as I ſaid, 1. By his Spirit and Graces; and ſo he is ſaid to dwell in us [by faith.] 1. <hi>Formaliter,</hi> faith being the principal part of that grace which dwelleth in us. 2. <hi>Conditionaliter,</hi> Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a condition of our right to the Spirits abode. 3. <hi>Efficienter,</hi> as the act of faith doth directly cauſe the increaſe, and ſo the abode of the habit; and alſo as it exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth other graces. If you will call this efficiency an inſtrumental efficiency, I think it is no proper ſpeech: We do not uſe to call the act of intellection, Mans inſtrument of knowing or increaſing the habits of knowledge: but I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with you about this: Nor yet if you ſay, This act of beleeving is Mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument (of exciting and increaſing grace in himſelf) directly, and Gods inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remotely: As my pen is immediatly my inſtrument, and remotely his that holds my hand. Or rather I ſhould ſay, as my action in writing is improperly called my inſtrument, and his. And thus man may be ſaid (yea more properly then thus) to ſanctifie himſelf, and God to ſanctifie man by himſelf: But in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification the matter is far otherwiſe: Man doth neither Juſtifie himſelf, nor God juſtifies man by himſelf. The ſecond way of Chriſts dwelling in us, is Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively. And here if you will ſpeak ſo improperly, as to ſay that mans act of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving is his inſtrument of receiving Chriſt as an Object, or of the Objects abode in the ſoul, I will not con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That it is but the <hi>ſpecies</hi> and not Chriſt himſelf that is obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively received, and thus dwelleth in us. 2.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55369:31"/>
or read, that go your way; and therefore theſe words deſerve a little further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. Their meaning, as far as I can underſtand of the whole buſineſs is this: 1. They conceive of Chriſts own righteouſneſs, wherewith himſelf was righteous, as given to us. 2. They conceive of the act of faith, as the inſtrument of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this. 3. Upon the receiving of this, they conceive we are juſtified, as a man that receiveth Riches is Rich, or that receiveth Honour is Honourable. 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe faith is the inſtrument of receiving righteouſneſs, therefore ſay they, It is the inſtrument of Juſtification. For Juſtification <hi>Conſtitutivè,</hi> is but a relation reſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from righteouſneſs received. This is the ſumme of the common judgement of moſt that I have read.</p>
                     <p>But theſe things muſt be more accurately conſidered, I think. And 1. It muſt be known, that the Righteouſneſs given us, is not the Righteouſneſs whereby Chriſts perſon was Righteous: (for accidents periſh being removed from the ſubject:) but it is a Righteouſneſs merited by Chriſts ſatisfaction and obedience, for us.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It muſt needs be known that the faith which is the Juſtifying condition, is terminated on Chriſt himſelf as the object, and not on his Righteouſneſs which he gives us in Remiſſion: Remiſſion or Righteouſneſs may be the end of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in receiving Chriſt; but Righteouſneſs or Remiſſion is not the object recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by that act which is made the condition of Juſtification: or at leaſt but a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary remote object; even as a woman doth not marry a mans Riches, but the Man; though it may be her end in marrying the man, to be enriched by him: nor is her receiving his riches the condition of her firſt Legal right to them; but her taking the man for her husband. And as a Patient being promiſed to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if he will take ſuch a man for his Phyſitian, and wholly truſt him, renouncing all other: Here it is not receiving Health, or a Cure that is the proper Condition of the Cure: Health and Cure is the end for which the Phyſitian is Accepted and Truſted: but it is himſelf as a ſufficient faithfull Phyſitian which is the object of that receiving, which is the condition of the Cure. The like may be ſhewed in other Relations, of a Maſter and Scholar, Prince and Subjects, Maſter and Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Receiving the perſons into relation, from whom we expect the benefit, goes before receiving the benefit it ſelf by them; which is uſually the remote end, and not the object of that firſt reception which is the condition. Our Divines there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the Aſſembly do perfectly define juſtifying faith to be, <hi>A receiving and reſting on Chriſt alone for ſalvation, as he is offered in the Goſpel.</hi> It is of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequence to define juſtifying Faith to be the Receiving of Juſtification or Righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In my judgement, it is a meer fancy and deluſion, to ſpeak of the receiving a righteouſneſs that we may be juſtified <hi>Constitutivè</hi> thereby, in ſuch a ſenſe, as if the righteouſneſs were firſt to be made ours, in order of nature before our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and then Juſtification follow becauſe we are righteous; and ſo theſe were two things: For to receive Righteouſneſs, and to receive Juſtification is one thing. Gods juſtifying us, and pardoning our ſin, and his conſtituting us righteous, and his giving us righteouſneſs, is all one thing under ſeverall notions. Yet as God giveth, 1. Conditionally. 2. Actually: ſo man receiveth, 1. <hi>Receptionè Ethica activâ,</hi> figuratively called receiving. 2. <hi>Receptione Phyſica, propriâ, paſſivâ:</hi> The former goes before Juſtification: but only as a ſmall, and ſecondary part of the condition, if properly any (it being the accepting of Chriſt himſelf that is the main condition:) The later is nothing at all but <hi>Juſtificari,</hi> commonly called, Paſſive Juſtification.</p>

It was not to us, but to God, that Chriſt gave ſatisfaction, and the price of our Redemption. And yet juſtifying faith doth as neceſſarily reſpect Chriſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and merit, as it doth our Juſtification thereby procured.

To ſay therefore, that the juſtifying act of faith, is only the receiving of Chriſts Righteouſneſs or of Juſtification, is to exclude the receiving of Chriſt himſelf any way; even to exclude him as ſatisfier from the juſtifying act: and to exclude from that act, his Redemption, by blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, ſatisfaction and merit: For if it be only the receiving of righteouſneſs, that is the juſtifying act, then it is neither the receiving of Chriſt himſelf, nor yet the acknowledgement of his Satisfaction and Redemption by his blood; and ſo they muſt ſay of theſe as they do of the reception of Chriſt as Lord, that it is the <hi>fides quae juſtificat, ſed non quà juſtificans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5.

                     <p n="6">6.

                     <p n="7">7. The great thing therefore that I would deſire to be obſerved is this; that though faith were an inſtrument of the foreſaid objective, or of the Ethical, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical recption of Chriſt (which yet is not properly, being <hi>ipſa Receptio,</hi>) yet it is not therefore the inſtrumental cauſe of the paſſive, proper reception of Right to Chriſt or Righteouſneſs. Of this it is only the condition and not the proper inſtrument. (For I ſhall ſhew hereafter that it is impoſſible it ſhould be both:) It doth morally qualifie the ſubject to be a fit patient to be juſtified, as M. <hi>Benjam. Woodbridge</hi> ſaith truly, in his excellent Sermon of <hi>Juſtification.</hi> The reaſon of this is, That it is only Donation or the will of the Donor ſignified, that can efficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convey a right to his own Benefits. The Receiver is not the Giver, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55369:32"/>
not the conveyer of Right. Every inſtrument is an efficient cauſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt effect: and it is only <hi>giving</hi> that effecteth this right. Now if the giving (the donation) had been abſolute, it had abſolutely conveyed right; and faith would have had no hand in it, as being no condition: Or if the gift had conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted another condition, that other would have had the cauſing intereſt that faith now hath (<hi>ut cauſa ſiue qua non.</hi>) So that the the neareſt and formal intereſt of faith is, Its being the condition; and its apprehenſion of its object, is but the remote aptitudinal reaſon, being <hi>ipſa fides.</hi> The great thing therefore that I affirm is this, That if you will needs call faith the inſtrument of apprehending Chriſt, or righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, yet doth it not juſtifie <hi>proximè &amp; formaliter, As</hi> ſuch; but <hi>As</hi> the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the gift performed.</p>

If any will take the word Inſtrument ſo improperly and largely, as to comprehend the condition, then you may ſo further ſay, [Faith is not only the inſtrument of Active reception, but of true Paſſive reception of Right to Chriſt, and ſo of receiving Juſtification.] 6.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55369:32"/>
To the firſt, this is the only true Anſwer: Faith Juſtifies rather then any thing elſe, becauſe God in framing his deed of gift, was pleaſed to make faith the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: The meer conſtitution of the Donor is the cauſe. To the ſecond, this is my Anſwer: God choſe faith to this office of being the juſtifying condition, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then other duties, becauſe it was fitteſt: as being in its own nature, An ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of a freely given Chriſt, and Life with him (which men call the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality.)

What you mean by [abſolute] I cannot certainly ariolate, unleſs that which is never a principall. 2. Nor know I whether by [ſole] you mean <hi>Materialiter, Formaliter, vel Reſpectivè quoad cauſam principalem.</hi> 1. Two materials may concurre to make one formal inſtrument: Here the inſtrument is but one, though the matter of it may be of divers parts. Sure this is not your ſenſe, that faith and ſomething elſe materially concurre to make one inſtrument. 2. An inſtrument may be called [ſole] formally, when it it is the only inſtrument, and there is no other concurreth to the effect. If you mean that my exceptions hold againſt none but ſuch ſole inſtruments, then it is more nakedly, then truly aſſerted: nor do they hold ever the more or leſs, whether the inſtrument be ſole or not: elſe they would hold againſt few inſtruments in the world. For it is not uſual to have an effect produced by a ſole inſtrument: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of ſubordinate inſtruments, though it may be uſual as to coordinate. 3. An inſtrument may be called [ſole] <hi>Respectivè,</hi> as to the principal cauſe: <hi>viz.</hi> It is not the inſtrument of many principals, but of one only. Is this your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that my exceptions would hold, if faith were only mans inſtrument, or only Gods; but not when it is both? If ſo 1. This is affirmed without the leaſt ſhew of proof, or reaſon; why my exceptions hold not as much againſt that inſtrument of a double principal, as of a ſingle? ſurely the nature of an inſtrument is not varied by that. 2. If God and man be both principals (as they muſt be, if faith be the inſtrument of both) then either coordinate or ſubordinate; but neither of theſe, as I have argued before. Man neither forgives himſelf under God, or with God, if you ſpeak of one and the ſame forgiveneſs. Though I know there is another kinde of forgiveneſs, whereby a man may forgive himſelf: whereof <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>de Ira,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>[Why ſhould I fear any of my Errors, when I can ſay, See thou do ſo no more, I now forgive thee.] lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 36.

In the firſt Text, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the words profiting in the real change of the ſoul; and our queſtion is of the Relative. The Scripture meaneth, The word had not that further work on the heart, as it hath in them that mix it with faith: will you interpret it thus: [The Word did not juſtifie them.] 2. Its true, that the Word did not juſtifie them: but thats conſequential only of the former unprofitableneſs. Once prove that man is but as much efficient in juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying himſelf, as he is in the obedience and change of his minde or actions; and then you do ſomething. 3. Is here ever a word for the Goſpels receiving its effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to Juſtification by faith? no nor of its ſo receiving that real profit of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, which is here meant, neither. Its weak arguing to ſay, The Word profited not, becauſe it was not mixt with faith: therefore faith conveys to it its efficacy of ſanctifying, yea of juſtifying. You cannot but know the ſequel would be denied. In progreſſive ſanctification, and obedience, and exerciſe of graces, the word and faith are concauſes, and one will not effect without the other: But it followeth not that therefore faith gives efficacy to the Word in this (much leſs to Juſtification where faith is no efficient.) For concauſes have not influence on each other, but both on the effect. The want of faith may hinder the Word from that further work one the ſoul, which preſuppoſeth faith (for faith is not wrought with faith's cooperation.) and thats all that the Text ſaith: But may not the abſence of faith hinder, unleſs when preſent it doth effect? I am ſure in Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, where it is but a condition, it may. The nature of a condition, when the gift is free and full, is not to effect the thing, but to ſuſpend the efficacy of the inſtrument, till it be performed. As (if I may uſe ſo groſs a ſimilitude) the clicket of a Croſs-bow doth hinder the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The ſecond Text I know not how you mean to make uſe of; unleſs you argue thus: The Word worketh effectually only in Beleevers: therefore faith conveyeth efficacy to the Word. I think I need not tell you, that I deny the ſequel (not to ſpeak of the antecedent:) nor yet to tell you that this ſpeaks not of working the relative change of Juſtification.</p>

If our faith give efficacy and power to the Goſpel to juſtifie us, then we juſtifie our ſelves when the Goſpel ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies us! then the Goſpel is our inſtrument of Juſtification! And can this be unleſs it be alſo ſaid that we made the Goſpel? Then God and we are concauſes in the Goſpels act of Donation: And is it the ſame power and efficacy for juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, which the Goſpel receives from God, and which it receives from faith? or are they divers? If divers, ſhew us what they are; and which part of its power and efficacy the Goſpel receives from faith, and which from God? If they are the ſame, then God muſt convey juſtifying efficacy and power into faith firſt, and by faith into the Goſpel: which who imagineth? or why ſhould I be ſo vain as to ſtand to confute it? O that you had condeſcended ſo far to your Readers weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as to have deigned to ſhew him, <hi>Quomodo patitur Evangelium recipiendo? &amp; Quid recipit ut ſiat potens &amp; efficax? &amp; quomodo haec potentia &amp; efficacia fuit in fide? utrum eminenter an formaliter? aut utrum fides id communicavit quod nunquam habuit? &amp; quomodo agit fides in hoc influxu cauſativo in Evangelium?</hi> with many more of the like, which you make neceſſary to be enquired after. And why gave you no proof from Scripture or reaſon for a point that is ſo new, that I think never man printed before you, for ſo far as I can learn at preſent: That ſaith gives efficacy and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſanctifying or exciting Grace, perhaps ſome before you have delivered: but that it gives efficacy and power of juſtifying, I think not any.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And ſure you do not take the foregoing words for proof: If you do, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire your Reader may not do ſo, What though only Believers are juſtified by the Covenant? Doth it follow that faith gives efficacy and power to the Covenant to juſtifie? Then either there are no conditions or cauſes <hi>ſine quibus non:</hi> or elſe

they all are efficient<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No: Yet the Teſtament doth not <hi>efficaciter agere</hi> till they are performed. Why is that? Becauſe all ſuch inſtruments work morally, only by expreſſing <hi>ut ſigna</hi> the Will of the Agent: and therefore they work both when and how he will; and it is his Will that they ſhall not work till ſuch a time, and but on ſuch terms; and ſo he frames the conditions himſelf, as <hi>obices</hi> to ſuſpend his Teſtament or other inſtrument from acting or effecting, till they are performed: but not to give efficacy and power to his Teſtament. If the gift be <hi>in diem,</hi> the inſtrument receives not efficacy and power from the Time, <hi>quando venit dies:</hi> no more doth it <hi>per prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtationem conditionis.</hi>

Sanctification is aſcribed to the Spirit as the efficient, but ſo is not forgiveneſs and Juſtification. Nor do I like your phraſe, as to ſanctification it ſelf, That faith conveys efficacy and power to the Goſpel through the Spirit: For 1.

                     <p n="2">2. If the Goſpel received by faith be a plenary inſtrument of juſtifying, as you ſay: Then 1. How is faith more fitly called an inſtrument? 2. Then <hi>Recipere Evangelium</hi> is <hi>inſtrumentum juſtificandi maximè proprium</hi> (as you think) making the Goſpel a compleat inſtrument.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If faith and the Goſpel be both full compleat inſtruments, then either <hi>ejuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem effecti per eandem actionem, vel per diverſas:</hi> not <hi>per eandem actionem,</hi> For 1. Then they ſhould be one inſtrument. 2. Their <hi>eſſe</hi> is ſo different that their <hi>operari</hi> muſt needs be different. 2. If <hi>per diverſas actiones,</hi> then coordinate or ſubordinate: You think ſubordinate, it ſeems, and that faith gives power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to the Goſpel; If ſo, then faith doth <hi>modo &amp; ſenſu nobiliore Juſtificare quam Teſtamentum.</hi> But thats farre from truth: For 1. It is moſt proper to ſay, The Covenant-grant juſtifieth: or the Law of grace juſtifieth; but it is leſs proper to ſay, Faith juſtifieth: and Scripture never ſaith ſo that I know of; but that we are juſtified by faith. 2. You ſay your ſelf that faith is but a paſſive inſtrument: but the Teſtament is active, (morally in its kinde.) 3. <hi>Recipere Evangelium</hi> is not ſo properly <hi>Juſtificare,</hi> as is <hi>immediate Juſtificare, Remittere, Jus ad Chriſtum &amp; remiſſionem conſtituere,</hi> which is the Goſpels act. <hi>Credere non eſt tam propriè Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficare.</hi> Much more might be ſaid of this, if neceſſary.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. How plain a contradiction do you ſpeak, that faith and the Goſpel are two inſtruments: and that both make one compleat inſtrument. They might have been ſaid to be materially two things, making one inſtrument without contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but not without notorious untruth.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. For it is no better when you ſay, they make up one compleat inſtrument. For 1. You ſaid before that faith gives power and efficacy to the Goſpel: which if true, then the Goſpel is an inſtrument ſubordinate to faith, and therefore not one with it. 2. The Goſpel is <hi>cauſa totalis in ſuo genere,</hi> fully as an inſtrument conveying right, <hi>quando vel venit dies, vel praeſtatur conditio:</hi> therefore it is not <hi>cauſa partialis, vel pars cauſae.</hi> 3. There is ſuch a diſparity in the actions of each, viz. <hi>Credere,</hi> and <hi>Remittere vel donare Chriſtum &amp; Remiſſionem,</hi> that they cannot poſſibly as <hi>cauſae partiales,</hi> conſtitute one compleat cauſe: For one immediatly and properly produceth the effect: the other not ſo. 4. You ſay, that they are both paſſive inſtruments: But ſo they cannot make one inſtrument: For ſurely <hi>nec patiuntur idem, nec ab eodem; nec formam Juſtificationis Evangelium patiendo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipit.</hi> Though indeed your authority muſt do more then your reaſons, to prove it of either.</p>

                     <p>To conclude this Point, for the compromiſing or ſhortening this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and me, I will take your fairer offer, <hi>pag.</hi> 75. or elſe give you as fair an offer of my own. Yours is this: [Faith is conſidered under a double notion. Firſt as an inſtrument (or if that word will not be allowed) as the way of our intereſt in Chriſt, and priviledges by Chriſt.] In this general I eaſily agree with you.</p>
                     <p>If that ſatisfie not, I propound this, Call you it an inſtrument of receiving Chriſt, and conſequently righteouſneſs; and give me leave to call it preciſely a condition, or a moral diſpoſition of the ſubject to be juſtified; and I will not contend with you: So be it, you will 1. not lay too great a ſtreſs on your own notion, nor make it of flat neceſſity, nor joyn with them that have made the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts believe that its a great part of the Proteſtant Religion, and conſequently that in confuting it, they refell the Proteſtants. 2. Nor ſay any more that it gives efficacy and power to the Goſpel to juſtifie us, and is more fitly then the Goſpel called an inſtrument. 3. Yea, I muſt deſire that you will forbear calling it at all an inſtrument of Juſtification, and be content to call it an inſtrument of receiving Juſtification: and I would you would confeſs that too to be an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſpeech. If you reſolve to go further, let me deſire you hereafter 1. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that its you that have the Affirmative, that faith is the inſtrument of juſtifying us: and I ſay, It is not written, you adde to Scripture: Therefore ſhew where it is written, expreſſely or by conſequence. 2. Do not blame me for making ſincere obedience part of the meer condition (wherein I think you ſay as much as I) and ſo as giving too much to man, when you give intollerably ſo much more as to make him the inſtrumental efficient cauſe of forgiving and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying himſelf. 3. Above that I have yet ſaid, I pray forget not one thing: to prove faith to be the inſtrumental efficient of ſentential Juſtification (which is moſt properly and fully ſo called) as well as of Legal conſtitutive Juſtification. For thats the great point of which you have juſt nothing (<hi>pace tui ſi ita dicam</hi>) of which you ſhould have ſaid much. And ſo much for the Controverſie.</p>

                     <p>THere is yet a third opinion, which I may well doubt whether I underſtand, but ſo far as I do underſtand, I am as far from aſsent to it as either of the former: and that is of thoſe, who do not only aſſert a perſonal inherent Righteouſneſs, as well as impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, against the Antinomians; but alſo affirm that this Righteouſneſs is compleat and perfect: which if it were meant only of the perfection of the ſubject, as oppoſed to hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, diſſimulation, or doubleneſs, implying that they do not only pretend for God, but are really for him; that they do not turn to him feignedly (as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſometime char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, <hi>Jer. 3.10.</hi>) but with an upright heart: Or of the perfection or entireneſs of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: (reſpecting not one, or only ſome, but all Commandments) which is called a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of parts; we might readily aſſent to it. The Covenant cals for ſuch perfection, <hi>Gen. 17.1.

                     <p n="3">3. I do charitably conjecture, that when you ſpeak of [a perfection of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject] you do not mean as you ſpeak, but you mean a perfection of our Acts as they reſpect the object, extenſively (for whether you include or exclude intenſion, I know not.) Here muſt I diſtinguiſh between objects of abſolute neceſſity, (and ſo of the acts about thoſe objects) which a man cannot be juſtified or ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: and 2. Objects of leſs neceſſity (and ſo acts) which its poſſible to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified and ſaved without. In regard of the former, I confeſs our acts may be ſaid to be [Truly acts that are exerciſed about ſuch objects] if you will call that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection (as in a larger ſenſe you may:) But as to the later, I acknowledge no ſuch perfection. And therefore (for that which you call [A perfection of parts] I acknowledge that every righteous man, hath a perfection of the eſſential parts (that is, he wants them not) but not of the integral alwaies; much leſs of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which are improperly called parts.</p>

And in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſenſe and nature of [Perfection] I cannot give you more of my minde
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55369:40"/>
in a narrow room, then <hi>Schibler</hi> hath laid down in <hi>Metaph.</hi> l. 1. c. 11. <hi>Perfectum eſt cui ad eſſentiam nihil deeſt.</hi> Scaliger <hi>Exercit.</hi> 140. p. 470. <hi>Omne quod eſt, ſibi eſt, &amp; bonum, &amp; totum, &amp; perfectum.</hi> It is a Metaphiſical Tranſcendental Perfection that I ſpeak of, which hath no contrary in Being; which conſiſteth in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all things neceſſary to Being: and that only of an inferiour, derived Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch as the creature is; for we meddle not with the infinite Divine Being or perfection; Nor do we take it in a comparative ſenſe, but in an abſolute: this being a Righteouſneſs perfect in its kinde, though a more perfect kinde acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, may be found out: I take it rather <hi>nominaliter</hi> then <hi>participaliter:</hi> but ſtill remember that I take it not <hi>de perfectione accidentali, ſed eſſentiali.</hi> And therefore I ſtill maintain that in ſeveral accidental reſpects our Righteouſneſs is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.</p>
                     <p>Now to know how our Righteouſneſs is eſſentially perfect, let us conſider what is eſſential to it. Its form is a Relation of our actions and diſpoſitions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, and our ſelves remotely, as compared with the Law or Rule. This Law (beſides the conſtitution of the reward and puniſhment conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, of which we now ſpeak not) doth 1. Conſtitute (I mean efficiently deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine) what ſhall be our duty in general. 2. It determineth more ſpecially, what part of this duty, ſhall be the condition of our Juſtification and ſalvation, <hi>ſine qua non.</hi> When we come to be judged at Gods barre, he that hath performed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſhall be juſtified, though he have omitted much of the other duty: but all that have not performed the condition ſhall be condemned. (But remember of what it is that this is the condition: <hi>viz.</hi> of the new Law of grace, whoſe office is to make over to us Free remiſſion of ſins, and ſalvation through the ſatisfaction and merits of Chriſt: and not the condition of that Law, which gives the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward directly for the work.) Take up altogether then, and you will ſee that 1. Righteouſneſs is formally a relation: 2. And that not of our Actions or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to the meer precept of the Law, determining of duty as ſuch, (common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the moral Law;) but 1. to the Law, as determining of the condition of life or death; 2. to the promiſe and threatning of that Law, which are joyned to the condition. So that [to be righteous] ſignifieth (<hi>quoad legem novam</hi>) theſe two things: 1. [<hi>Non obligatus ad paenam, &amp; cui debetur praemium.</hi>] 2. [<hi>Qui con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionem impunitatis, &amp; praemii praeſtitit.</hi>] The firſt queſtion in judgement being [<hi>An ſit obligatus ad paenam, vel non? &amp; an praemium ſit debitum?</hi>] therefore the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is our firſt and principal righteouſneſs, and here to be pleaded. But before the firſt queſtion can be determined, the ſecond muſt be raiſed and reſolved, [<hi>Utrum praeſtitit conditionem?</hi>] And here the ſecond is our Righteouſneſs (<hi>conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis praeſtatio</hi>) by which we muſt anſwer the accuſation [<hi>Conditionem non praeſtitit.</hi>] That is, [He lived and died an unbeliever or impenitent.] So that 3. You ſee that our firſt Righteouſneſs [<hi>Non reatus paenae: vel jus ad impunitatem &amp; ad prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium,</hi>] as it requireth Chriſts perfect ſatisfaction, as a <hi>medium</hi> to it, by which all the charge of the Law of works, muſt be anſwered; ſo it requires our perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the condition of the Law of grace, as another <hi>medium,</hi> by which Chriſt and his benefits are made ours, and by which the falſe accuſation of [being unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and impenitent, and ſo to be condemned by the Law of grace it ſelf, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no part in Chriſt] muſt be anſwered, and we juſtified againſt it. 4. It is not only the form of our righteouſneſs, that is <hi>tranſcendenter</hi> perfect, but alſo the matter, as ſuch, as it is the matter: that is, the ſubject actions and diſpoſitions, are ſubjects truly capable of that relation. All this is no more but that it is a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55369:41"/>
true Righteouſneſs, and not equivocally or falſly ſo called: and ſo that even the matter or ſubject, is really the matter or ſubject of ſuch a Righteouſneſs. 5. The form here being a relation, in it ſelf, admits not of degrees. 4. The matter or ſubject (our diſpoſitions and actions) though <hi>qua materia,</hi> they have the foreſaid metaphyſical perfection, yet conſidered in it ſelf, or conſidered in reference to the meer precept of the Law, and ſo in its meer morality, it is imperfect. As <hi>Schibler</hi> ſaith, <hi>Omne perfectum eſt ens: &amp; omne ens eſt perfectum tranſcendentali, &amp; eſſentiali perfectione: Duobus tamen modis adhuc poſſunt entia vocari imperfecta.</hi> 1. <hi>Accidentali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, quod ſcilicet deſit id quod ad integritatem vel Ornamentum, vel altiorem &amp; intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem statum pertinet. Et ſub bac imperfectione etiam continetur imperfectio, quae eſt in defectu partium materiae minus principalium. Nam materia pertinet ad eſſentialem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionem, ſed id completur ſatis ſecundum partes principales in toto heterogeneo, quae ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientes ſunt ad radicandam &amp; ſuſtentandam formam, manifeſto iudicio, quod ablatis partibus minus principalibus, manet prior ſpecies. Veluti ſi homo &amp; careat pedibus, &amp; brachiis &amp; naſo &amp; oculis, adhuc tamen est homo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Atque ita per ablationem partium minus principalium nihil adhuc deeſt quod pertineat ad tranſcendentalem perfectionem, quae eſſentialis eſt ipſius hominis. Atque ita homo adhuc eſt perfecte homo, &amp; perfecte ens: indeque nec hac imperfectione tollitur perfectio tranſcendentalis,</hi> &amp;c. 2. <hi>Poſſunt vocari entia [Imperfecta] comparatè, quod ſcilicet non habeant eſſentiam tam perfectam &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilem, quam alia. Ita materia est imperfecta, quia non fit, tam nobile ens ac forma,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Haec igitur imperfectio iterum non tollit perfectionem tranſcendentalem, quo minùs tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendenter, perfecta dicantur quae ſic ſunt imperfecta,</hi> l. 1. c. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In both theſe reſpects I confeſs and maintain that our Righteouſneſs is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: that is 1.

The Righteouſneſs which we have in or from Chriſts perfect ſatisfaction and merits, is a Righteouſneſs of a more noble and perfect kinde, then this inherent Righteouſneſs required by the Law of grace: for the later ſtands in ſubordination to the former, as a neceſſary means, <hi>i. e.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to make it ours. <hi>Omne tamen ens eſt perfectum, non ſolum in genere entis, ſed etiam in genere talis entis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Et ſic etiam materia, etſi in comparatione ad alia entia, fit ſatis imperfecta, tamen in ſuo genere habet omnino perfectionem, neque ſic deeſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And thus I have done what at preſent I thought my duty, that it might not be my fault that you are [in ignorance all over.] But I have ſaid the leſs becauſe I have lately more exactly opened the nature of our Righteouſneſs, in Anſwer to the Animadverſions of another Learned Brother.</p>
                     <p>You adde [I never took imperfect Righteouſneſs to imply any ſuch contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, any more then imperfect holineſs.] Reply: 1. Holineſs is taken 1. For [the relation of a Perſon or Thing dedicated to God:] and ſo I confeſs it admits not of a <hi>magis</hi> or <hi>minus</hi> any more then Righteouſneſs. 2. But our common uſe of the word [Holineſs] when about perſons, is for the qualities or actions of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually-renewed man: and ſo I further ſay: 2. That this alſo hath its tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental perfection, as well as Righteouſneſs. But here's the difference (which if
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55369:41"/>
you adde to what is ſaid before, you will more fully ſee my thoughts.) Holineſs thus taken is a quality, which though it have the truth of Being, yet is intended and remitted, or doth <hi>recipere magis &amp; minus.</hi> Righteouſneſs is a relation, which in <hi>ſuo formali</hi> is not intended or remitted. Nay if you will exactly open it, it will appear that the Righteouſneſs in queſtion is a Relation founded in a Relation (the real conformity of our Acts to the Law or Rule, as it determineth what ſhall be the condition.) Yea more, that the very <hi>ſubjectum proximum hujus relationis, nec intenditur nec remittitur:</hi> and this is it that I mean by perfection, beſides the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid tranſcendental perfection. But (becauſe theſe things are <hi>exactioris indagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis</hi>) underſtand that the reaſon of this my aſſertion lies here: The Law as it is the rule of obedience, doth require perfect obedience in degree; and ſo here is an imperfection in our actions in the degree, as being ſhort of what the Rule requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; and it being theſe actions with their habits that we call our holineſs (<hi>ab effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciente &amp; fine</hi>) therefore we muſt needs ſay, Our holineſs is imperfect: And if our Righteouſneſs were to be denominated from this Law, commanding perfection, we muſt ſay, not that ſuch Righteouſneſs were imperfect, becauſe the holineſs or obedience is imperfect; but it is none at all, becauſe they are imperfect: For im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect obedience or holineſs is not a ſubject or matter capable of the relation of [Righteous] according to that perfect Law which condemneth them, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth only gradually-perfect obedience, as capable matter, without which the form cannot be received. And ſo our faith, repentance, and ſincere Goſpel-obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as compared to this perfect Law, are no perfect Righteouſneſs, nor any Righteouſneſs at all: And ſo this being the matter of our inherent Righteouſneſs, I ſay, our faith and obedience are imperfect (though not imperfect Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe none) as thus compared. But then the Law as it is the determiner of the conditions, on which Chriſt and life ſhall be ours, hath made the matter or immediate ſubject, to be <hi>in puncto,</hi> as it were, ſo that it cannot be more or leſs, becauſe it is the ſincerity only of our faith and obedience, that is made the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Life, and not the gradual perfection. So that when we muſt be juſtified, the Queſtion will not be, [Haſt thou believed and obeyed perfectly?] but [Haſt thou done it Truly.] So that no imperfection of the matter conſiſtent with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, makes it leſs capable of the form, nor no perfection of degrees makes it ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of more of the form. The condition here is as truly performed, by true believing and obedience, in a lower meaſure, as in a higher: yea and this true performance is as full a Righteouſneſs (in relation to this part of the Law) as if the matter of faith and obedience were more perfect: The ſtrongeſt faith doth not make you Righteous in a higher degree, then the weakeſt that is true: For the ſtrongeſt is but <hi>praeſtatio conditionis</hi> (which is the Righteouſneſs in queſtion) and ſo is the weakeſt. It is not therefore from this act of the Law (determination of the condition) that our graces or duties, are diverſified as more or leſs perfect in degree, but it is in reſpect to the other act or part of the Law (determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of duty, as ſuch.) So that in a word, Duty ſimply as duty, and holineſs, or ſupernatural grace, as ſuch, may be more or leſs. But holineſs and duty, as the <hi>Materia requiſita vel ſubjectum proximum Juſtitiae, conſiſtit in indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibili.</hi>

                        <hi>R.B.</hi> 1. WIll not all the imperfections of our Righteouſneſs which in the Aphor. I aſſerted, ſerve to warrant the Prophets compariſon, without our denying the perfection of Being? That is, that it is truly Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. My opinion of that Text is, that the Prophet means plainly, [We are an unrighteous people,] or [we have no other Righteouſneſs to glory of, but what is indeed no righteouſneſs at all, no more then the filthy rags are clean] no nor ſo much; for they may poſſibly have ſome part clean. Yet that this is called Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, is no wonder, when the next words are Negative, <hi>q. d.</hi> [our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, is none; or is unrighteouſneſs:] yea it is not unuſual to give the name either from common eſtimation, or the perſons profeſſion, and eſpecially from thoſe actions which uſe to be the matter of Righteouſneſs, though the form being wanting, they are not now actually the matter. So I think <hi>Solomon</hi> forbiddeth overmuch Righteouſneſs. Further, it's conſiderable, what Righteouſneſs it is that the Prophet there ſpeaks of, whether univerſal or particular? and whether Legal, conſiſting in abſolute perfection; or Evangelical, conſiſting in ſincerity? and alſo whether he ſpeak of himſelf and each individual, or only of the Jewiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deſcribed according to the generality or main part of them.</p>

As for that next paſſage, where you tell us what [you underſtand not] I confeſs it ſeems ſtrange to me: but I hope you make it no argument againſt the opinion which you oppoſe. If it were a good argument indeed, then the leſs a man underſtands, the better he might diſpute. But let us ſee what it is that you underſtand not. 1. [How holineſs ſhould be imperfect taken materially?] Sure you underſtand that: for what elſe did you mean in the foregoing words, [No
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55369:42"/>
greater charge of imperfection can lye againſt the moſt imperfect holineſs?] 2. It is therefore, no doubt, the other branch that you mean, how [Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is perfect taken formally in reference to a Rule.] 1. That Righteouſneſs <hi>in ſenſu Legali &amp; ſorenſi</hi> is a relation conſiſting in a conformity, or congruency to the Rule, I ſuppoſe you underſtand, ſeeing both Schoolmen, and Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines do ſo commonly affirm it: <hi>e. g. Scotus</hi> and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Twiſs</hi> oft. 2. That <hi>omne ens eſt eſſentialiter perfectum,</hi> I ſuppoſe alſo you underſtand; and ſo that this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be a perfect Relation, or none at all: where there is the form, there is the being; and therefore the word [Righteouſneſs] ſpoken <hi>formaliter</hi> of our Righteouſneſs, muſt needs expreſs that which is truly Righteouſneſs, and not equivocally ſo called. 3. Yea I ſuppoſe you underſtand, that Relations do not admit of <hi>magis</hi> and <hi>minus ex parte ſui,</hi> but only when they are founded in quality, <hi>ex parte fundamenti vel ſubjecti:</hi> At leaſt if any would deny that, yet the relation in queſtion, being of the nature of [Parity,] and not of ſimilitude only, (which are both implied in conformity) doth not ſo much as <hi>ratione fundamenti</hi> admit of intenſion or remiſſion. Theſe things being all ſo generally acknowledged, you leave me only to admire that you ſhould ſay, You underſtand them not.</p>

                        <hi>R.B.</hi> 1. WHether you take holineſs as ſignifying a Quality or Relation, there is no doubt but it hath its form, or elſe it could not have a Being? Did you indeed imagine that I had denied that? 2. But that holineſs in our common uſe of the word, doth formally conſiſt in the relation of our qualities or acts to the Law, eſpecially in that relation of conformity, that we are now ſpeaking of, I finde not yet proved. Holineſs taken for the qualities and acts themſelves, is no relation. Holineſs taken for Dedication to God, is ſuch a kinde of Relation as Donation is: It referres to God as the <hi>terminus:</hi> For <hi>omne ſanctum eſt Deo ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum.</hi> But to be [Dedicated to God] and to be [conformed to the Law or Rule] are not all one. 3. If you or any man reſolve to uſe holineſs in the ſame ſenſe as righteouſneſs, if I once know your mindes, I will not contradict you, for I finde no pleaſure in contending about words. But for my ſelf I muſt uſe them in the common ſenſe, if I will be underſtood. 4. That you may uſe the word [Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs] materially, without relation to any Rule, is as much as to ſay, We may denominate <hi>a materia ſine forma.</hi> The form is relative. If you mean, We may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate that which hath a form, from the matter, and not from the form, then I Reply, 1. Then you muſt not denominate properly and logically: 2.

This all our Actions and Habits come ſhort of, and therefore no man hath a Righteouſneſs conſiſting in this conformity. The ſecond is the promiſe, or that act going along with the promiſe, whereby God determineth of the condition. This is twofold: One of the Law of Nature and Works; and according to this no man is Righteous: for the condition and the duty are of the ſame extent, it being obedience gradually perfect, that is here the condition. The other is of the Law of Grace; which determineth what ſhall be the condition of our Right to Chriſt and Life. <hi>Paul</hi> never complaineth of an imperfection of Eſſence, of this laſt.

It is but in this one point that I charge them with Ignorance. And who is not ignorant in more points then one? If it be ſo proud and arrogant a ſpeech as ſome other Brethren have affirmed it to be, then every man is proud and arrogant that differs from another, and diſputeth the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. For I cannot differ from any man unleſs I ſuppoſe him to Erre: And doubtleſs every man is ſo farre Ignorant as he Erreth. Muſt I then differ from none? yea from no Learned Divines? Why then when one affirmeth and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denieth, I muſt be of both ſides, for fear of cenſuring one ſide as Ignorant or Erroneous. 3. I confeſs I was not well acquainted with the <hi>genius</hi> of many of my Reverend and truly Honoured Brethren. I thought that no godly man would have taken himſelf wronged, if a man told him, he had Error, no more then to tell him he had ſin. I took it for granted that <hi>humanum eſt errare,</hi> and that we know but in part, and that ſanctifying grace had ſo farre deſtroyed pride, and made the ſoul apprehenſive of its imperfection, that, at leaſt, men of eminent godlineſs could have endured patiently to hear that they are not omniſcient nor infallible, and that they have ſome ignorance with their eminent knowledge? and why not in this point as well as another? If any think that I arrogate that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to my ſelf which I deny to them: I reply, So I do in every caſe wherein I differ from any man living: For if I thought not my judgement right, it were not indeed my judgement: and if I thought not his opinion wrong, I did not differ from him. But if they will affirm that therefore I do either vilifie them, or prefer my ſelf in other things, I hope they will bring better proof of their affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For my own part I unfeignedly profeſs my ſelf conſcious of much more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance then ever I charged on any of my Brethren in the Miniſtry: yea I muſt profeſs my ſelf ignorant in a very great part of thoſe Controverſies, which are moſt commonly and confidently determined by my Brethren.

And then who knows not that the Vulgar or ordinary weaker Teachers, do take up that opinion, which is moſt in credit, and which is delivered by the moſt Learned Doctors whom they moſt reverence?

(For it juſtifieth no man for his ſins.) But the former is true: Therefore the later. I doubt not but you know the ſtate of the Controverſie on this point, between us and the Papiſts.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. If the Law of works do denominate a man righteous, for imperfect works (which truly and properly are but a leſs degree of unrighteouſneſs) then it ſeems that all wicked men (if not the damned) are legally righteous: For they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not every act of ſin that was forbidden them, and therefore are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous in the utmoſt poſſible degree. And the Law of works doth not call one degree of obedience [Righteouſneſs] more then another, except it be perfect.

If our Faith, Repentance and ſincere Obedience, may be, muſt be, and is, called our Righteouſneſs, as it is the performance of the conditions of the new Covenant, or Law of Grace, then (at leaſt) not only as they have an imperfect agreement with the Law of Works. But the antecedent is true: Therefore the conſequent.</p>
                     <p>Let us next peruſe Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s Reaſons, why [He is wholly theirs in this ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.] He ſaith [<hi>I know no other Rule, but the old Rule, the Rule of the morall Law; that is with me a Rule, a perfect Rule, and the only Rule.</hi>] Rep. <hi>Sed diſtinguen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eſt.</hi> The morall Law is taken either for the entire Law of works conſiſting of Precept and Sanction (and that either as it is the meer Law of nature, or as containing alſo what to <hi>Adam</hi> was ſuperadded) or elſe it is taken only for the meer preceptive part of a Law, which is not the whole Law. In the later ſenſe, it is taken 1. For the preceptive part of the Law given to <hi>Adam.</hi> 2. For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive part of the Law of nature redelivered by <hi>Moſes.</hi> 3. For the preceptive part of the Law of nature, now uſed by Chriſt the Mediator, as part of his own Law. 2. We muſt diſtinguiſh of a Rule. 1. There is the Rule of obedience, or what ſhall be <hi>due from us:</hi> This is the precept (under which I comprehend the prohibition, it being but <hi>praeceptu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> non agendis.</hi>) 2. There is the Rule of reward, determining what ſhall be due to us: This is the conditional promiſe or gift, ſo far forth as it determineth <hi>de ipſo praemio.</hi> 3. There is the Rule of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, determining what ſhall be due to man upon his ſin: This is the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. 4. There is the Rule of the condition of the reward or puniſhment, and of judging to whom they do belong, determining on what conditions or terms on their parts, men ſhall be ſaved, or elſe damned; (though the ſame acts were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commanded in the precept as they are duties, yet to conſtitute them conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the promiſe, is a further thing.) This is the promiſe and threatning, as they are conditional, or as they conſtitute their own conditions. I think the ſolidity and great neceſſity of all theſe diſtinctions, is beyond Diſpute. Theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, 1. What confuſion is it to talk of the moral Law being the only Rule, when it is not one thing that is called the moral Law? and who knows what you mean? 2. How ſtrange a thing is it to my ears, that you, even you, ſhould ſo <hi>wholly</hi> own this, and ſo heartily profeſs that you take the Moral Law for the <hi>only Rule?</hi> For ſuppoſe you take it for the preceptive part of the Law of nature only (as I think you do:) 1. That is but part of that very Law of nature: Doth not the Law of nature, as well as the poſitive Law, determine <hi>de Debito paenae,</hi> as well as <hi>de Debito officii?</hi> and is a Rule of puniſhment as well as duty. 2. Or if you took it for the whole Law of nature, is that the only Rule? 1. What ſay you for matter
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55369:45"/>
of duty, to the poſitive Precepts of the Goſpel? of Baptiſm, the Lords Supper, the Lords day, the Officers and Government of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is the Law of nature the only Rule for theſe? If you ſay, They are reducible to the ſecond Commandment: I demand 1. What is the ſecond Commandment for the Affirmative part, but a general precept to worſhip God according to his Poſitive Inſtitution? And doth this alone ſuffice? Doth it not plainly imply that there are and muſt be poſitive Laws inſtituting a way of worſhip? 2. Do you take the Precept <hi>de genere,</hi> to be equivalent to the Precepts <hi>de ſpeciebus?</hi> or to be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Rule without them? If the Moral Law, or Law of Nature, be to you, <hi>the only Rule,</hi> and a <hi>perfect Rule,</hi> then you need no other. And if God had only writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the ten Commandments, or only ſaid in general, [Thou ſhalt worſhip God according to his poſitive Inſtitutions] would it have been your duty to have Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, adminiſtred the Lords Supper? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Doth the general Precept conſtitute this particular Ordinance as my duty? If not (as nothing more certain) then the general Law, is not the only Rule, nor ſufficient in <hi>omni parte</hi> (though ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in <hi>ſuo genere, &amp; ad partem propriam</hi>) for the conſtitution of Worſhip, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, Church, Offices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or acquainting us with our duty therein. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, did Chriſt in Inſtituting theſe Ordinances and Officers, do any more then was done before, or not? If no more, 1. It is ſuperfluous. 2. Shew where it was done before. 3. Sure the fourth Commandment did not at once command both the ſeventh day of the week and the firſt. If more, then the former was not ſufficient, nor is now the only Rule.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, doth not the Scripture call Chriſt a Lawgiver? and ſay, <hi>The Law ſhall go out of Zion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3. And is he not the Anointed King of the Church; and therefore hath Legiſlative power? And will he not uſe the principal part of his Prerogative?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I think the Moral Law, taken either for the Law given to <hi>Adam</hi> or written in Tables of ſtone, is not a ſufficient Rule to us now for beleeving in Jeſus Chriſt; no nor the ſame Law of nature, as ſtill in force under Chriſt. For a general command of beleeving all that God revea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, is not the only Rule of our faith; but the particular revelation and precept are part. And a general command to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to what way God ſhall preſcribe for our juſtification and ſalvation, is not the only Rule, but that particular preſcript is part. And a general command of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving every offered benefit, is not the only or ſufficient Rule for receiving Chriſt, without the Goſpel-offer of him and his benefits.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And I ſuppoſe you grant that as mans ſoul hath an underſtanding and a will, the former being a paſſage to the later, in the former practical receptions being but initiate and imperfect, and in the later perfected; ſo Laws have their prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces declaring the grounds and occaſions of them, oft times; and ſo the Laws of God have their Narratives, Hiſtories and Doctrines, concerning the grounds, the ſubject, the occaſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as the more eſſential parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Precepts and Sanction. Theſe I ſpoke not of before in the diſtinctions. Now do you indeed think that the Law of nature, or what ever you now mean by the old Rule and Moral Law, is the ſufficient and only Rule of Knowledge, Judgement and Faith? I take it for granted that you will acknowledge the aſſenting act of faith to be in the underſtanding: and that the Word of God is the rule of this aſſent. Had you in the old Rule or Moral Law, a ſufficient and only Rule for your faith, in the Article of Chriſts Incarnation, Birth, Life, Innocency, Miracles, Death, Burial, Reſurrection, Aſſenſion, full Dominion in his humane nature? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Was this
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55369:45"/>
Article in the Creed before Chriſts coming [<hi>Except ye beleeve that I am he, ye ſhall die in your ſinnes?</hi>] Beſides, matter of faith is alſo matter of duty: for it is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to beleeve all theſe Truths. But I think it was then no mans duty to believe that this Jeſus the ſon of <hi>Mary</hi> was the Saviour, before he was Incarnate; or to believe that Chriſt was Dead, Aſcended, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore that which you call the Old Rule, is not as you ſay the Only Rule of our Duty in Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But what if all this had been left out, and you had proved the Moral Law, the only Rule of duty? doth it follow that therefore it is the <hi>only Rule?</hi> Sure it is not the only Rule of rewarding! For if you take the Moral Law, for the meer preceptive part of the Law of nature, then it is no Rule at all of rewarding; for it is the promiſe, and not the precept that doth make due the reward. And if you take the moral Law for the whole Law of nature, it is a very great Diſpute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>Regula pramiandi</hi> at all; much more as to that great reward which is now given in the Law of grace by Chriſt (your ſelf deny it, <hi>pag.</hi> 74.) I dare not ſay that if we had perfectly obeyed, Everlaſting Glory in Heaven had been natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally our due. And for Remiſſion of ſin, and the Juſtification of a ſinner, and ſuch like, they are ſuch mercies, as I never heard the Law of nature, made the only Rule of our right to them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The ſame I may ſay of the Rule of puniſhment. The privation of a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, offered Remiſſion and Salvation, is one part of the penalty of the new Law, of which the Moral Law can ſcarce be ſaid the only Rule. (<hi>None of them that were bidden ſhall taſte of the Supper.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. But the principal thing that I intend, is that the Moral Law is not the only Rule what ſhall be the condition of Life or Death: and therefore not the only Rule according to which we muſt now be denominated, and hereafter ſentenced Juſt or Unjuſt. For if the accuſer ſay He hath not performed the conditions of the Law of grace, and therefore hath no right to Chriſt and Life] or ſay ſimply that [we have no right to Remiſſion and Salvation;] if we can deny the charge, and produce our performance of the ſaid conditions, we are then <hi>non-condemnandi,</hi> and the Law of grace, which giveth Chriſt and Life on thoſe conditions, will juſtifie us againſt that charge, of having no right to Chriſt and Life: But I think ſo will not the Moral Law. The Law of works juſtifieth no man but Chriſt: therefore it is not the Law of works by which we are to be juſtified in judgement. But ſome Law we muſt be juſtified by: for the Law is the Rule of judgement: and the word that Chriſt hath ſpoken ſhall judge us: therefore it muſt be by the perfect Law of Grace and Liberty. If it be then ſaid againſt us that we are ſinners againſt the Law of nature; we ſhall all have an anſwer ready [Chriſt hath made ſufficient ſatisfaction.] But if it be ſaid that we have no right to the pardon and righteouſneſs which is given out by vertue of that ſatisfaction, then it is the Law of Grace, and not the Moral Law, that muſt juſtifie us: Even that Law which ſaith [<hi>Whoſoever beleeveth ſhall not periſh,</hi> &amp;c.] Moreover doth not the Apoſtle ſay plainly, that [<hi>Christ is the Mediator of a better Covenant, eſtabliſhed on better promiſes: and if that firſt Covenant had been faultleſs, then ſhould no place have been ſought for the ſecond: but finding fault with them he ſaith, Behold the daies come ſaith the Lord that I will make a new Covenant,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6, 7, 8. which ſpeaks not only of Ceremonial precepts, but principally of the promiſory part.</p>
                     <p>If you ſhould ſay, This is the Covenant and not the law. I Reply 1. Then the law is not the only Rule. 2. Its the ſame thing in ſeveral reſpects that we call a Law &amp; a

Covenant (except you mean it of our Covenant act to God, of which we ſpeak not.) Who knows not that <hi>praemiare &amp; punire</hi> are acts of a Law? and that an act of oblivion or general pardon on certain terms, is a Law: and that the promiſe is the principal part of the Law of grace. So that I have now given you ſome of my Reaſons, why I preſumed to call that [Ignorance] which I did not then know that you would ſo Wholly own.</p>

And truly I dare not yet ſay that you are guilty of this: For though I have read my Book over and over of purpoſe in thoſe parts that treat of this ſubject, and can finde no ſuch word as you here charge me with; yet before I will lay ſuch a thing to your charge, I will ſuſpect that it may poſſibly be in ſome odd corner where I overlookt it, or cannot finde it. But I ſee (if I am not overſeen) how unſafe it is to report mens words themſelves, much more their opinions, from the reports of another, how Grave, Sober, Pious and Friendly ſoever. If when we are dead, men ſhall reade Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>'s Book that never read mine, and there ſee it written that I ſaid [Sincerity is the new Rule, or the rule of the new Covenant.] Can any blame them to believe it, and report it of me, as from him, and ſay [<hi>What, ſhall I not beleeve ſuch and ſuch a man, that reports it in expreſs words?</hi>] But let this go, with this concluſion: If indeed I have ſpoken any ſuch words, I retract them as <hi>non</hi>-ſenſe, and when I finde them I ſhall expunge them: If I have not, patience is my duty and relief; and I have long been learning, that we muſt ſuffer from Godly and Friends, as well as from ungodly and enemies; and till I had learned that leſſon, I never knew what it was to live quietly and contentedly.</p>

Yet, if the truth were known, I do not think but both <hi>Davenant,</hi> and you and I agree in ſenſe, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer only in manner of ſpeaking. My ſenſe is this: Our obedience to the Law of God is ſo imperfect, that we are not juſt but guilty, and condemnable in the ſenſe of the Law of works: therefore ſpeaking ſtrictly, we are not righteous at all <hi>in ſenſu forenſi</hi> according to this Law: but ſpeaking improperly, and giving the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination <hi>à materia,</hi> or <hi>ab accidente aliqua, &amp; non a formâ,</hi> ſo we may be ſaid to have an imperfect legal righteouſneſs, while equivocally we call him juſt, that is but comparatively leſs unjuſt then another. For though righteouſneſs <hi>in ſenſu forenſi,</hi> have no degrees, yet unrighteouſneſs hath many. 3. And I ſuppoſe you know that Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi> doth not only ſay as much as I concerning the intereſt of works in Juſtification, but alſo ſpeaks it in the very ſame notions as I did. If you have not obſerved it, I pray reade him <hi>de Juſt. Hab. &amp; Act. cap.</hi> 30. <hi>pag.</hi> 384. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 31. <hi>p.</hi> 403, 404, 405. <hi>&amp;</hi> 570, 571, 572, 633.</p>
                     <p>And then I would ask you but this Queſtion: If the accuſation charge us to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55369:47"/>
have no right in Chriſt and Life, becauſe we died unbelievers and impenitent, or rebels againſt Chriſt; muſt not we be juſtified againſt that accuſation, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing our faith, repentance, and ſincere obedience it ſelf? and if ſo (then which nothing more certain) are not theſe then ſo farre our righteouſneſs againſt that accuſation to be pleaded? And if it be not a true righteouſneſs, and metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically perfect, and ſuch as will perfectly vindicate us againſt the accuſation of being prevalently and finally unbelievers, impenitent or rebels againſt Chriſt, there is no Juſtification to be hoped for from the Judge, but condemnation to endleſs miſery.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, the <hi>Theſis</hi> that <hi>Davenant</hi> proves in the Chapter which you cite, is <hi>inhaerentem juſtitiam non eſſe cauſam formalem juſtificationis noſtrae coram Deo.</hi> And if that be true, then it is impoſſible that it ſhould have the formal reaſon of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in it. For if there be <hi>vera forma,</hi> there muſt needs be the <hi>formatum,</hi> and he that hath true formall rigteouſneſs, muſt needs be thereby conſtituted Righteous, or juſtified <hi>conſtitutivè,</hi> and then he muſt needs be ſentenced Juſt, who is Juſt.</p>
                     <p>But then note that <hi>Davenant</hi> ſpeaks of that univerſal righteouſneſs, whereby we are juſtified againſt the accuſation of being ſinners condemnable by the Law of works; (and here Chriſts ſatisfaction is our righteouſneſs) and not of that particular Righteouſneſs whereby we muſt be juſtified againſt the accuſation of finall <hi>non</hi>-performance of the conditions of the Covenant or Law of grace: For there it is the performance of thoſe conditions, which muſt it ſelf be our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſo far juſtifie us.</p>

                     <p>The [Covenant] is ſometime taken for Gods part alone, ſometime for our part alone, ſometime for both conjunct, even for a mutual Covenanting. As it is taken for Gods act, it ſignifieth 1. Either ſome abſolute promiſe of God, made 1. Either to Chriſt concerning men, or on their behalf (and ſo the elect may be ſaid to be in Covenant before they are born, becauſe Chriſt hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that they ſhall be ſaved, and the <hi>non</hi>-elect are in Covenant before they are born, becauſe Chriſt hath a promiſe of ſome good to them.) 2. Or to men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: And that is either 1. Common, or 2. Peculiar to ſome. 1. Common: as the promiſe made to fallen mankinde that a Saviour ſhould be ſent to Redeem them. The promiſe made to the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that the Meſſiah ſhould be of

them according to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>eſh, and perſonally live among them, and preach the Goſpel to them. The promiſe made to <hi>Noah</hi> and the world, that the earth ſhould no more be drowned with water: The promiſe of preaching the Goſpel to all Nations (which is common, though not abſolutely univerſal:) the promiſe of a Reſurrection to all the world, and that they ſhall be judged by Chriſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and (at leaſt thoſe that heard the Goſpel) on the terms of the new Law, and not on the meer rigorous terms of the Law of entire nature: the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a fuller and clearer promulgation and explication of the Law of grace, when Chriſt ſhould come in the fleſh: the promiſe of a fuller meaſure of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to be poured out, for Miracles to confirm the Chriſtian Doctrine to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, hearers and actors; that there ſhall be a Miniſtry Commiſſioned to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple and Baptize all Nations, maintained to the end of the world (which gives Miniſters right and authority to Baptize them;) and if there be any other the like promiſe of the <hi>means neceſſarily anteceding faith.</hi> Thus farre many thouſands that are unregenerate, and <hi>non</hi>-elect, may be ſaid to be in Covenant, that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe promiſes. 2. Some of theſe abſolute promiſes are peculiar to ſome: as to one Sex (though common as to that Sex) as the mans ſuperiority: to one Age: to one Degree in order of nativity (as to the elder brother to have ſome ſuperiority over the younger, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7.) to one Nation, as to the Iſraelites were made many peculiar promiſes; and thoſe before mentioned which I called com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as to all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were peculiar to them (ſome of them) in excluſion of other Nations. And ſome to particular perſons, good or bad: as for ſucceſs in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, or other enterpriſes; for averſion of ſome threatned judgement; for the abating of ſome inflicted puniſhment; for ſome temporal or common bleſſing; of which ſort we finde many particular promiſes which God by ſome Prophet made with particular men. In all theſe reſpects I ſay wicked men have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a promiſe, yea men not elect to ſalvation: and thus far they may be ſaid to be in Covenant with God. But this is but a lax and improper ſpeech, to ſay (ſuch are in Covenant) to be uſed now among Chriſtians that have uſed to give the name [Covenant] by an excellency, to another thing. Alſo now wicked men are not under peculiar perſonal promiſes of temporal things, as then they were, becauſe now there are no extraordinary Prophets, or other the like Meſſengers o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Revelations from God to make ſuch particular promiſes to men. (Yet I will not ſay God hath reſtrained himſelf from this, or cannot, or will not do it at all, or that no man hath ſuch Revelations; but only 1. That it is not uſual. 2. Nor is God engaged to do it.)</p>
                     <p>So for the abſolute promiſe of the firſt ſpecial grace (firſt faith and repentance) to be given to all the Elect (ſuppoſing that there is ſuch a promiſe:) this is made to none but the ungodly and unregenerate, though elect (unleſs you will ſay, it is made to Chriſt for them, or rather is a prediction of good eventually to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on them.)</p>
                     <p>But though in all theſe reſpects wicked men are under a promiſe, yet it is none of all theſe that gives them right to Baptiſm. There is no queſtion of any but the laſt: and for that I have proved in my Appendix againſt Mr. <hi>Bedford,</hi> that it is not that Covenant that Baptiſm ſealeth, Whither I refer you to avoid Repe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">2. As for Conditional promiſes to man, they are either</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:55369:49"/>1. Peculiar: as extraordinary promiſes of temporal bleſſings conditionally made to ſome particular perſons heretofore. Of theſe I ſay, as of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: Wicked men may be under ſuch promiſes; but theſe give not right to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Common: ſuch as are not made to this or that man more then others, but to all, at leaſt in the tenour of the grant, though it be not promulgate to all. Of this ſort 1. Some ſuppoſe certain promiſes to go before the great Law of grace. 2. But I yet know not of any but the Law of grace it ſelf, (anon to be deſcribed.) 1. Thoſe that do ſuppoſe ſome ſuch antecedaneous promiſe, are of two ſorts: 1. The Arminians and Jeſuites. 2. Such as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> about Church-Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. 1. The Jeſuites and Arminians ſpeak of two ſuch common promiſes. 1. One is of the giving of ſupernatural means of Revelation, to men, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the right uſe of natural Revelation. As if God had promiſed to all Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and Infidels that never heard of Chriſt, that they ſhall have the Goſpel ſent them, if they will uſe the light of nature well, or will ſeek out for the Goſpel. 2. The other promiſe which they imagine is, that God will give ſupernatural or ſpecial grace (<hi>viz.</hi> the firſt grace of faith and repentance) to men, on condition they will uſe well their common grace and means. I know of no ſuch promiſe as either of theſe in Scripture (of which ſee <hi>Davenant</hi> in his Diſſertation of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Redemption.) When any Arminian will ſhew ſuch a promiſe in Scripture, we ſhall yield. But yet I will tell you how far I yield. 1. I yield that God doth actually give temporal bleſſings to wicked men: But this is no Covenant or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Yet it gives them a right to enjoy them <hi>de praeſenti</hi> while they do enjoy them; ſo that it is not ſound Doctrine of them that ſay, Wicked men have no right to the creature, in whatſoever they poſſeſs, and that they are but uſurpers. For if you ſee one naked in the ſtreet, and put him on a garment; he hath right to wear that and enjoy it, while you permit him: But yet becauſe you promiſe him nothing for the future, he is not certain a moment of the continuance of that right or poſſeſſion, for you may take it off him again when you will. So wicked men have right and poſſeſſion of Gods mercies by actual collation <hi>de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenti,</hi> but not by promiſe <hi>de futuro,</hi> or by ſuch proper donation, as gives them the full propriety (for ſo God uſeth not to part with the propriety of his creatures to any.) 2. I yield that God doth give to Heathens, who have but natural light, ſome helps which have a tendency to their further advancement, and doth appoint them certain means to be uſed for the obtaining of a higher light, and that he giveth them ſufficient encouragement to go on in the chearfull uſe of thoſe means, in poſſibilities and probabilities of ſucceſs; ſo that they are unexcuſable that uſe them not. Theſe Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> cals half promiſes (as who knows but the Lord may do thus and thus? <hi>Pray therefore if perhaps the thoughts of thy heart may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thee,</hi> &amp;c.) But promiſes properly they are not. God hath thought meet to keep himſelf diſengaged from this ſort of men. 3. The very ſame I yield of men in the viſible Church uſing common grace, as well as they can: that is, that God hath appointed certain means which ſuch men are to uſe for the getting of ſpecial grace: that thoſe that periſh, do juſtly periſh, for not uſing thoſe means ſo well as they could, and ſo for not beleeving: that he hath given them ſufficient incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to uſe ſuch means by examples, experiences, the nature of the means, and ſome half promiſes of ſucceſs: but no promiſe properly ſo called. 4. I yield that he actually gives ſaving grace to wicked men: or elſe none could have it. But this they can plead no right to before they have it.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:55369:49"/>2. The ſecond ſort of promiſes before the great Covenant of grace, is feigned by Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> (and if there be any other that go that way, as ſome do, and that with ſome difference among themſelves:) and that is A promiſe of Church-priviledges upon condition of a faith not juſtifying or ſaving. Here ſome annex ſpecial grace to theſe Church-priviledges, and ſo fall into the Arminian ſtrain. So Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> doth make a common (not-juſtifying) faith, the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Baptiſm, and then that Baptiſm a means <hi>non ponenti obicem</hi> of the certain Juſtification of all the Baptized, and ſo, at leaſt, the infants of all common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, baptized, ſhould be certainly juſtified. But I finde not Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> any where owning this connexion of ſpecial grace, and efficacy of Baptiſm on ſuch: therefore I ſuppoſe it is but ſome common mercies that he ſuppoſeth this promiſe to make over to the Baptized. But I will enquire further into his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on anon.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The common or general promiſe-conditional, which I acknowledge, is the new Law of grace, or of faith, wherein God promiſeth [to be our God, ſo we will take him for our God, and will be his people] and [to give us Chriſt and Life, if we will accept him as he is offered in the Goſpel] or [that he that repenteth and beleeveth, ſhall be juſtified and ſaved] and he that doth not ſhall be damned: Whereto is alſo annexed, the promiſe of temporal mercies, ſo far as they are good for us; as appurtenances to the main bleſſings of the Covenant. Now I will tell you how far wicked men are under this great promiſe or Covenant, 1. As it is a conditional promiſe on Gods part, or a Law of grace enacted conditionally gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt and Life to all men, ſo All men are under it, or the ſubjects of it: that is, All the whole world, as to the tenour of the Law of grace, following the meer enacting; and all that hear the Goſpel, as to the promulgation. 2. So as it hath a precept conjunct, requiring them to believe and repent for remiſſion and ſalvation, ſo all are under it, that hear it. 3. So are they as to the annexed threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon their unbelief and impenitency. 4. So as the Preachers of the Goſpel do by Commiſſion from Chriſt, apply all this to them, and intreat them by name to repent and believe, and offer them Chriſt and the other benefits of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, if they will repent and believe; ſo wicked men are ſtill under the promiſe or Covenant, as to the Nunciative offers and exhortations, which is ſomewhat more then a meer Promulgation of it as a Law. All theſe waies, or in theſe reſpects, I yield that wicked men, or unregenerate men, may be under promiſe, or Gods Covenant. But this is not ſtrictly to [be in Covenant:] nor is this it that the right of Baptiſm belongs to: For all this belongs not only to <hi>Pagans,</hi> but even to <hi>obſtinate Pagans</hi> that perſecute this Goſpel, and draw out the blood of thoſe that thus Preach it to them: whom I ſuppoſe, few Divines Judge meet ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>And thus we have ſpoken of Gods act in the conditional promiſe, before the condition be performed by man, and ſo before Gods promiſe do actually conferre right to the ſinner. As for the act of Gods Covenant afterwards, I ſhall ſpeak of it anon.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Having ſaid thus much of Gods act of promiſe or Covenant, and ſeen how far the wicked may be ſaid to be under that promiſe or Covenant, we muſt next conſider of their own promiſe to God, or the act of Covenanting on their own part. Mans Covenanting with God, or his entring the Covenant of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to him, is either 1. to be conſidered in reſpect of the efficient; 2. or of the object. As to the efficient, it is either 1. The act of the whole man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>i.e.</hi> of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55369:50"/>
minde and body: 2. Or of part only: and that 1. either of the minde alone: 2. or of the outward man alone. 2. Objectively conſidered, it is either 1. A true proper conſent agreeable to the formall object (or to the object in its abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſary reſpects and nature.) 2. Or it is an imperfect conſent, analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally or equivocally called [Covenanting] when it is not ſuited to the formall nature of the object. This errour is 1. About the object ſimply in it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. 2. About the object comparatively conſidered: as God compared with the creature. And both or either of theſe errours is 1. Either in the intellect: when it doth not underſtand the nature of the object, and Gods terms on which only he offers his bleſſings; or at leaſt doth not practically underſtand it, but ſpeculatively only. 2. Or of the Will: when it doth not really conſent to the object, and terms of God, though they be underſtood, at leaſt, ſpeculatively. 3. Or it is, both the errour of the underſtanding and the will.</p>
                     <p>Having thus neceſſarily diſtinguiſhed, I will lay down in theſe Concluſions, how far man is in Covenant with God as to his own act. 1. Man may oblige himſelf by Vows to particular duties, that are not of the ſubſtance of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and yet be wicked. 2. Yea man may oblige himſelf to things indifferent, and ſome think to evil, as <hi>Jeptha,</hi> ſo far as to enſnare himſelf in a neceſſity of ſinning, whether he perform it or not. 3. That which God requireth of man on his part, as a neceſſary condition, to his right in the benefits promiſed by God, and that God may be, as it were, obliged actually to man, is the ſincere reſolved conſent of the Heart or Will. 4. Yet he requireth for ſeveral reaſons, that the external profeſſion of conſent be added, where there is capacity and opportunity. 5. God doth as abſolutely require to our participation of his bleſſings, and that his Covenant may be in force actually to give us right to them, and he, as it were, obliged to give us the things promiſed, that we underſtand the abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary part of the object of our conſent, or acceptance; and that with a practical knowledge. 6. As abſolutely doth he require that we do really conſent according to that practical underſtanding. 7. It is eſſential to God as the object of mans faith, to be his ſupream Lord and Rector as Creator, and his ultimate end and chiefeſt good: and ſo muſt he be apprehended and willed by all that indeed take him for their God: as alſo to be perfect in Being, Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Power, and of perfect Veracity. 8. It is eſſential to Chriſt as the object of our faith, to be God-man, that in our nature hath Ranſomed us, by the Sacrifice of himſelf on the Croſs for us, and Died, and Roſe again, and is now Aſcended in Glory with the Father, and is Lord of us all, and will Judge according to his Word to Everlaſting Joy or Puniſhment. 9. It is eſſential to the object of our faith, as ſuch, to be conſidered comparatively. As that God be taken not only as our good, but our chief Good, to be preferred before every creature: that he be taken not only as our Lord, but as Sovereign Lord, to be obeyed before all other: that Chriſt be taken for our only Saviour, and for our Lord-Redeemer, to be alſo obeyed before all creatures; particularly before and againſt the devil, the fleſh, and the world. 10. Where theſe eſſentials are not in the apprehenſion of the object, there is not truly the conſent, or faith, or covenanting which God hath made the condition of his Promiſe; and therefore ſuch are ſaid (as to the Faith, Conſent and Covenant ſo required) but equivocally or analogically to Conſent, Covenant or Believe: when truly and properly it is to be ſaid, that they do not Conſent or Covenant. Conſent hath relation to the offer: and if it be not the offered thing that is conſented to but ſomewhat elſe under that name, then it is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55369:50"/>
not indeed Conſent: for there is no Relate without its Correlate. Covenanting (in the preſent ſenſe) implies Gods propounded Covenant and terms. For our entring the Covenant, is not a Making of terms, but an Accepting of the terms made to our hands and tendered (with a command to accept them.) Now if we do not conſent to the ſame terms propounded, it is truly no Accepting, nor no Covenanting: For God never offered to enter into Covenant on ſuch terms, and that which was never offered, cannot be properly accepted; nor can we Covenant with God in a mutual Covenant, on terms contrary to thoſe which he propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The Civil Law ſaith, <hi>Ignorantis non eſt Conſenſus.</hi> A God that is inferiour to creatures in Rule, or in Goodneſs and Deſirableneſs, is not God indeed. And therefore he that takes God in this ſenſe for his God, takes but the Name of God, and not God himſelf, but an Idol of his brain. A Chriſt that is only a Juſtifier and not a King and Governour, is not the Chriſt that is offered us of God; and therefore no man is called to accept ſuch a Chriſt. To erre therefore about the very eſſence of the Object, as ſuch, is to null the Act, it can be no Conſent or Covenant or Acceptance truly at all, but equivocally only. 11. The ſame may be ſaid of counterfeit Covenanting, when it is only <hi>ore tenus,</hi> with the mouth and not the heart. 12. Yet may an oral counterfeit Covenanting oblige the party to the duty promiſed (in our caſe) though it give him no right to the benefit offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor is God as it were obliged to perform his Covenant to ſuch. 13. The like may be ſaid of the foreſaid equivocal erroneous Conſenting, Accepting, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting. If the errour be through the fault of the man himſelf, his act may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige himſelf, though God remain diſobliged, and though he have no right to the thing promiſed by God. Thus much I thought meet to ſay, for the opening of that branch of the Queſtion, How far men unregenerate may be in Covenant, as to their own act.</p>
                     <p>But the great Queſtion is yet behind, Whether theſe men be in Covenant with God, as to Gods actual engagement to them: ſo far as that Gods premiſe is in force for conveying actual right to them as to the promiſed bleſſings? and ſo whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a mutual Covenant, and both parties be actually obliged? And thus I ſay that wicked men are not in Covenant with God, that is; God is not in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them: Neither have they any right to the main bleſſings given by the Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt, Pardon, Juſtification, Adoption, Glory: Nor yet to the common bleſſings of this Covenant, for they are given by the ſame Covenant and on the ſame conditions as the ſpecial bleſſings: So that though they may have right to them at preſent on the ground of Gods preſent collation, or truſting them with them (as a ſervant hath in his Maſters ſtock) yet have they no right by Covenant: For it is Godlineſs that hath the promiſe of this life, and of that to come, as being the condition of both; and it is ſeeking firſt Gods Kingdom and Righteouſneſs, that is the condition on which other things ſhall be added to us. The ſame holds of Church-priviledges and Ordinances <hi>quoad poſſeſſionens</hi> not proper to the faithfull.</p>
                     <p>So that in the concluſion, I ſay, that though wicked men have many promiſes from God, eſpecially the great conditional promiſe of Life, if they will repent and believe; and though they are alſo obliged by their own imperfect, equivocal Covenanting with God; yet God remaineth ſtill unobliged to them, and they have no actual right to the benefits of his promiſe; becauſe they have not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the condition of their firſt right, that is, have not Covenanted truly with God, or entred the Covenant which he propounded; having not conſented to his terms,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55369:51"/>
nor accepted Chriſt and Life as offered in the Goſpel: And therefore it is the moſt proper language to ſay, that none but ſincere beleevers are in Covenant with God: For the reſt have but equivocally Covenanted with God, and God not actually engaged in Covenant with them (for while the condition is unperformed there is no actual obligation on the promiſes) and ſo it is no proper mutual Covenant. And conſequently theſe men in proper ſtrict ſenſe, are no true Chriſtians, but analogically only.</p>
                     <p>Yet becauſe we have no acceſs to their hearts, and therefore muſt judge of the heart by the profeſſion and outward ſignes, therefore we muſt judge theſe probably to Covenant with the heart, who do profeſs to do ſo with the tongue; and thoſe to Covenant entirely and without errour in the eſſentials, who profeſs ſo to do: and therefore we muſt judge them probably to be true Chriſtians, and truly godly men (till they retract that profeſſion by word or deed:) and therefore we muſt judge them probably to be truly in Covenant with God, and ſuch as God is, as it were, obliged to juſtifie: and therefore we muſt give them the name of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and men in Covenant with God: and therefore we muſt uſe them as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in works of charity, and in Ordinances, and Church communion: and ſo muſt uſe their children as Chriſtians children. The warrant for this uſage and Judgement, I muſt deſire the Reader to take notice of, in what I have written to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Tombes</hi> Objections on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. and to Dr. <hi>Ward,</hi> and againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Tombes</hi> Precurſor more fully: For to repeat all here again would be tedious and unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. When Chriſt ſaith to us, [<hi>If a Brother repent, forgive him</hi>] here by [Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting] doth Chriſt mean plainly <hi>Repenting,</hi> or the profeſſion of it? No doubt, repenting it ſelf. Why, but how can we that know not the heart, know here when our Brother repenteth? Will Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> ſay therefore that none is obliged to forgive? Rather we know that man muſt judge him to repent that profeſſeth ſo to do: and therefore forgive him that profeſſeth it. Not becauſe profeſſing was the aſſigned requiſite condition: but a ſign of that condition: and therefore we are to accept of no profeſſion, but what probably ſignifieth true repentance. For if we knew a man diſſembled, or jeered us in profeſſing repentance, we are not bound to do by him as a penitent. So God commandeth us to love and honour them that fear the Lord, that are faithfull, that love Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we know not who theſe be: Are we therefore diſobliged from loving and honouring them? Or will Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> ſay that we muſt not honour them, leſt we miſtake and give that honour to one that hath no right to it? (as he ſaith about the Sacrament; herein joyning with Mr. <hi>Tombes.</hi>) Thoſe that profeſs to fear God and love him, we muſt love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as men that do fear and love him: yet in different degrees, as the ſignes of their graces are more or leſs propable. In ſome common profeſſing Chriſtians, we ſee but ſmall probability: yet dare we not exclude them from the Church, nor the number of true believers, as long as there is any probability: Others that are more judicious, zealous, diligent, and upright of life, we have far ſtronger probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of; and therefore love and honour them much more.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> therefore in my judgement had done better, if, with that moderate, Reverend, Godly man Mr. <hi>Stephen Marſhall,</hi> he had diſtinguiſhed between theſe two Queſtions, [Who are Chriſtians or Church-members?] and [Whom are we to judge ſuch and uſe as ſuch?] and to bring in the unregenerate in the later rank only.</p>
                     <p>Next we are to ſee what is Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> judgement herein, that we may not argue againſt him before we underſtand: which yet I think I ſhall in ſome meaſure be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55369:51"/>
forced to do, or ſay nothing, 1. I finde it very hard to underſtand what perſons they be that he takes to be in Covenant: 2. And as hard to underſtand what Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant he means. For the firſt, I finde it clear that negatively he means, They are not truly Regenerate perſons, but Poſitively how they muſt be qualified I finde not ſo clear. <hi>Pag.</hi> 189. he ſaith it was with all that bore the name of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (which is no further true then I have laid down in the former Concluſions) ſo that it may ſeem that he takes all to be in Covenant that bear the name of Chriſtians. What? though they know not what Chriſt or Chriſtianity is? Is taking a name, entering into Covenant? The poor <hi>Indians</hi> that by thouſands are forced by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to be baptized, are ſaid to know ſo little what they do, that ſome of them forget the name of [a Chriſtian] which they aſſumed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 192. he ſaith [All profeſſed Chriſtians, ſo called, are in an outward and ſingle Covenant] 1. What? thoſe that are called profeſſed Chriſtians, and are not? No: ſure that's not the meaning: elſe mens miſcalling might put them in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. It is then thoſe that are ſo, and are called ſo: But will it not ſerve, if they are ſo, unleſs called ſo? 2. He means either thoſe that profeſs the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, or the Thing. Of the inſufficiency of the firſt, I ſpoke before. For the ſecond, if they profeſs the whole Eſſence of Chriſtianity undiſſembledly, I think they are truly Regenerate. If they profeſs but part (as to the Matter both of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Conſent, of which I ſpoke before in the Concluſions, and which we have in this County lately ſet down in our Profeſſion of Faith) then it is not Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which they profeſs: for part of the eſſence is not the Thing: where an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part is wanting, the form is abſent. If it be the whole matter of Chriſtianity that is profeſſed, but Diſſembledly; then as he is equivocally or analogically a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever or Chriſtian, ſo I yield he is a member of the Viſible Church, which ſo far as it is only Viſible, is equivocally called The Church: of which I have fullier ſpoken in Anſwer to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Tombes Praecurſor.</hi> I know M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Bl.</hi> thinks, that there may be an undiſſembled Profeſſion, which yet may not be of a ſaving Faith. But then I yet conceive it is not an entire Profeſſion of the whole eſſential object of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith, <hi>viz.</hi> of Aſſent and Conſent. It will be a hard ſaying to many honeſt Chriſtians to ſay, that a man not juſtified may believe every fundamental Article, and withall truly profeſs Repentance of all his ſins, and to Take God for his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign to Rule him, and his chief Good to be enjoyed to his happineſs; and to take Chriſt for his Lord and only Saviour, and his Word for his Law and Rule, and the holy Ghoſt for his Guide and Sanctifier, and the reſt which is eſſential to Chriſtianity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 192. He ſaith of all that externally make Profeſſion (Theſe engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon Gods terms.] But if they do ſo ſincerely they are ſincere Chriſtians: If not ſincerely, they are but equivocally Chriſtians. Some think that in the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> part of my Book of Reſt, I gave too much to an unregenerate eſtate: and yet I think there is nothing contrary to this that I now ſay. He that profeſſeth not to preferre God and the Redeemer before all other things, profeſſeth not Chriſtianity: and he that profeſſeth this and lieth not, is a Regenerate juſtified Chriſtian.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 200. he deſcribeth his unregenerate Chriſtians to be ſuch [as Accept the terms of the Covenant.] And this none doth indeed but the ſanctified. If Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> will ſay, that the unregenerate may do it, he will make them true believers: For what is true faith but an Accepting of Chriſt and his Benefits on the Covenant terms? Though I confeſs others may falſly ſay, they Accept him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:55369:52"/>
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 220. he ſaith [Laws tendred by a Prince, and received by a People, make up the Relation of King and people (yet indeed, that's not true, for it is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the man to be our King which is antecedent to the receiving his Laws, that makes the Relation.) A marriage Covenant tendred by a man, and accepted by a Virgin, makes up the Relation of Husband and Wife: Covenant draughts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man for ſervice, make up the Relation of Maſter and Servant: Now the Goſpel Covenant is all of theſe between God and a People.] Rep. The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Chriſt in this Covenant is true Juſtifying Faith: If an unregenerate man have this indeed, then he is juſtified, and Faith and Juſtification are common things, which I will not believe. If Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> mean that the external profeſſion of this Acceptance, alone, doth make up the Relation, I ſay, as before; It may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the Profeſſour, but makes not up the Relation of Real Chriſtians, becauſe God conſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>teth not, nor is actually in Covenant and obliged. The differences Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> muſt take notice of, between his humane Covenants, and ours with God, or elſe he will marre all. Men know not one anothers hearts, and therefore make not Laws for hearts, nor impoſe Conditions on hearts: and therefore if both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do profeſs Conſent, though diſſemblingly, they are both obliged, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is mutual. But God offers to Conſent, only on Condition that our hearts Conſent to his terms; and therefore if we profeſs Conſent, and do not Conſent, God Conſenteth not, nor is, as it were obliged.</p>
                     <p>Next Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> proceeds there to tell us, that the Accepting the Word preached, is the note of the Church. But that is a more lax ambiguous term then the former. Some call it an accepting the Word, when they are content to hear it: Some when they ſpeculatively believe the truth of it. Theſe are no true notes of true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or Churches (in the firſt ſenſe of the word Church.) Others Accept but part of that word, which is the neceſſary object of Faith, of whom the like may he ſaid. It is the Accepting Chriſt and Life in him, offered by this word, which is Chriſtianity it ſelf, or true Faith: and the profeſſion of this, is that which makes a man a Member of the Viſible Church (He may accept it for his Infants alſo.) So much for the indagation of Mr. <hi>Bl</hi>'s meaning about the deſcription of his viſible Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>Next, what he means by [Covenant] I confeſs I deſpair of knowing. Sometime he ſpeaks as if he meant it but of their own act of Covenant, whereby they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige themſelves. But ordinarily, it is evident, that he ſpeaks of a mutual Covenant, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd makes God to be alſo in Covenant with them. But what Covenant of God is t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>is? <hi>Pag.</hi> 192. He ſaith [they are in an outward and ſingle Covenant.] But what he means by a ſingle Covenant, I know not. He there alſo chooſeth to expreſs himſelf in <hi>Paraeus</hi> words, who diſtinguiſheth <hi>inter beneficia foederis</hi> (which he deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them) and <hi>Jus foederis</hi> (which he alloweth them.) But I confeſs I know not what <hi>Jus foederis</hi> is, except one of theſe two things: 1. A Right to enter Covenant with Chriſt: and ſo have Infidels. 2. Or a Right to the Benefits promiſed in the Covenant: and this he denieth them. If he meaneth (as <hi>Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>eus</hi> ſeems) a Right to be eſteemed as Covenanters, and uſed as Covenanters, by the Church (though indeed God is not in Covenant with them) this we eaſily grant.</p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>Bl</hi>'s common phraſe is, that they are [in the outward Covenant] and what that is, I cannot tell. I know what it is to covenant <hi>ore tenus,</hi> only outwardly, or by a diſſembled profeſſion, or elſe a profeſſion maimed, or not underſtood; and I have ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that hereby they may further oblige themſelves (ſo far as the creature can be ſaid to oblige it ſelf, who is not <hi>ſui Juris,</hi> but wholly Gods, and is under his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55369:52"/>
obligation already.) But it is Gods Covenant act that we are enquiring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In what ſenſe is that called Outward? 1. It cannot be as if God did as the diſſembling creature, <hi>ore tenus,</hi> with the mouth only covenant with them, and not with the heart, as they deal with him: 2. I know therefore no poſſible ſenſe but this, that it is called [Outward] from the Bleſſings promiſed which are outward. Here therefore, 1. I ſhould have thought it but reaſonable for Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> to have told us what thoſe outward Bleſſings are that this Covenant promiſeth. 2. That he would have proved out of Scripture that God hath ſuch a Covenant, diſtinct from the Covenant of Grace, which promiſeth Juſtification and Salvation, and having other Conditions on our part. For both theſe I cannot finde what outward bleſſings he means but Church Ordinances and Priviledges. Theſe conſiſt in the Word, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, Prayer, Diſcipline. For the Word, God oft beſtoweth it on Infidels, and in <hi>England</hi> there are men that deride the truth of Scripture, and eſteem it a fiction, and yet for credit of men, come ordinarily to the Congregation. Theſe have the Word given them, and ſo have other unregenerate men: but not by Covenant that I know of. Even the godly have no Covenant aſſuring them that for the future they ſhall enjoy the Word, further then it is in their hearts (except that promiſe with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, If God ſee it Good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Where hath God ſaid, If thou wilt with thy mouth profeſs to believe, I will give thee my Word preached? 2. For Baptiſm, It is part of our profeſſion it ſelf. And though God hath commiſſioned us to Baptize ſuch profeſſours and their ſeed, yet that is not a Covenant with them: Nor do I know where God ſaith, I will give thee Baptiſm, if thou wilt but ſay, thou believeſt, or if thou wilt profeſs ſeriouſly a half faith: More ſhall be ſaid againſt this anon. 3. For the Lords Supper the ſame may be ſaid. God hath no where made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that they ſhall have the Lords Supper that will profeſs faith. To feign God to make a Covenant with man, whoſe condition ſhall be orall profeſſion, and whoſe Bleſſing promiſed, is only the <hi>nudum ſignum,</hi> a little water to waſh men, and a little bread and wine, without that Chriſt, and Remiſſion of ſin, Mortification and Spiritual Life, which theſe Sacraments are in their Inſtitution appointed to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, ſeal and exhibit, this is, I think a groundleſs and preſumptuous courſe. 4. The ſame may be ſaid of Diſcipline: which, alas few Churches do enjoy. I deſire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that thoſe words of Scripture may be produced where any ſuch outward Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is contained. I take outward Ordinances and other bleſſings to be a ſecond part of, or certain appurtenances to the bleſſings of the great Covenant of Grace, and given by Covenant on the ſame condition (of true faith) as Juſtification it ſelf is: but allowed or given by Providence, where and when God pleaſeth, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to Infidels that never made profeſſion, as to ſome of them (the Word and temporal mercies) and not aſſured by promiſe to any ungodly man, that from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence receiveth them.</p>
                     <p>At laſt, after this neceſſary explication, I come to Mr. <hi>Bl</hi>'s words which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to Reply to. And firſt, when he ſaith [A dogmatical faith entitleth to Baptiſm.] I reply, 1. A meer Dogmatical, Hiſtorical faith, is only in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and that not Practical neither. Now if this be the condition of the outward Covenant, then it may conſiſt with a Renouncing Chriſt, and open diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming him, yea a perſecuting the very Chriſtian name: For a man may ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively and ſleightly believe the word of God to be true, and yet may openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs [I love the world, and my pleaſure, and honour, ſo much better then Chriſt; that I am reſolved I will be no Chriſtian, nor be baptized, nor take Chriſt on the terms that he is offered on.] At leaſt, he that profeſſeth Aſſent only, and will not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55369:53"/>
profeſs conſent alſo, doth not profeſs Chriſtianity: For Chriſtianity and true faith lieth in the Wils conſent, as well as the underſtandings Aſſent. 2. And how can Mr. <hi>Bl</hi> call this Dogmatical faith, a covenanting? when covenanting is known to be the expreſſion of the Wils conſent, and not the profeſſion of an opinion. 3. If a Dogmatical faith be the condition, and make a man a Chriſtian, then he may be a Chriſtian againſt his Will: which was yet never affirmed.</p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> in his explication of this Dogmatical faith, addeth by way of exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion [though not affecting the heart to a full choice of Chriſt.] Where he ſeems to imply (though he expreſs it not) that the faith which he meaneth doth affect the heart to a choice of Chriſt which is not full. But if ſo, then 1. It is much more then Aſſent, or a meer Hiſtorical Dogmatical faith. 2. But is the choice which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timateth Real, as to the Act, and ſuited to the Object? That is, the real choice of ſuch a Chriſt as is offered, and on ſuch terms? If ſo, it is Juſtifying faith. If not, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is counterfeit as to the Act, or but nominal as to the Object, and is indeed no chooſing of Chriſt. Though perhaps, it may not be ſuited to the Accidentals of the object, yet to the Eſſentials it muſt, or elſe it hath but equivocally the name as a corps hath the name of a man.</p>
                     <p>He ſaith, [The Covenant is the Ground of Baptiſm, otheewiſe Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip would evince no Title, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] Repl. 1. I take Gods precept to be the Ground of Baptiſm, as it is <hi>officium</hi> a Duty, both as to the baptizer and the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: and his Promiſe, or his Covenant Grant, to be the Ground of mens Right to it, as it is a Benefit given directly by God: and their own true conſent, faith or covenanting (which with me are all one, for all that you ſay againſt it) to be the condition of that Right. But then I think that <hi>in foro Eccleſiae</hi> a diſſembler may claim that Right which ſtrictly he hath not, and we muſt grant him what he claims when he brings a Probable ground of his claim: And in that it is Miniſters duty to Baptize ſuch, they may indirectly, and <hi>quoad Eccleſiam</hi> be ſaid to have Right to be Baptized. I ſay Indirectly, yea and improperly: for it is not the reſult of Gods Covenant Grant to them; but of his precept to his Miniſters, and his Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whom they ought to Baptize.</p>

                        <hi>R. B.</hi> WHat Abſurdities follow ſuch a reſtraint of it to ſound believers, as I have aſſerted, I ſhould be willing to know, though with ſome labor I ſearched for it. Bear with me therefore, while I examine what you refer me to. It is <hi>pag.</hi> 209. where you charge thoſe Abſurdities. And the firſt is this, 1. <hi>This reſtriction of the Covenant (to ſhut out all the non-regenerate) makes an utter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion between the Covenant it ſelf and the conditions of it: or (if the expreſsion do not pleaſe) the Covenant it ſelf and the duties required in it; between our entrance into Covenant, and our obſervation of it, or walking up in faithfulneſs to it. All know that a bargain for a ſumme of money, and the payment of that ſumme; the covenant with a ſervant for labor, and the labor according to this covenant, are different things. Faithful men that make a bargain, keep it; enter covenant, and ſtand to it: But the making and keeping; the entering and obſerving are not the ſame; and now according to this opinion, Regeneration is our entrance into Covenant, and Regeneration is our keeping of Covenant: before Regeneration we make no Covenant, after Regeneration we break no Covenant, there is no ſuch thing as Covenant-breaking. All this makes an utter confuſion in the Covenant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Reply 1. I have ſeldom met with a complaint of confuſion, more unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, where the guilt of it in the plaintiffe is ſo viſible as to marr all the work ſo much. 2. I cannot give my judgment of the intolerableneſs and great danger of your miſtake here manifeſted, without unmannerlineſs. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay but this; It is in a very weightie point, neer the foundation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to erre, cannot be ſafe. In my Aphoriſms I gave my reaſons (<hi>pag.</hi> 265) for the contrarie. It is a truth ſo far beyond all doubt, that <hi>our own Covenanting is a principal part of the condition of the Covenant of Grace,</hi> as that it is, in other terms, a great part of the ſubſtance of the Goſpel. 1. The conditions are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55369:54"/>
by God, and to be performed by us; the ſame act therefore is called <hi>our conditions</hi> as the performers, and <hi>Gods conditions</hi> as the Impoſer and Promiſer, giving his bleſſings onely on theſe impoſed conditions. Moſt properly they are called the conditions or Gods Covenant or Promiſe, rather then of ours: for our own Promiſe is the firſt part of them, and our performance of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe but a ſecondary part. For 2. Gods Covenant is <hi>a free gift of Chriſt and Life to the world on condition of their Acceptance:</hi> this our Divines againſt the Papiſts on the Doctrine of merit, have fully proved. Onely this Acceptance muſt have theſe neceſſary modifications, which may conſtitute it ſutable to the quality of the object, and ſtate of the receiver. It muſt be a Loving, Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Acceptance: and it being the Acceptance of a Soveraign, and Sanctifier, it contains a Reſolution to obey him. Our Acceptance, or Conſent, is our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting, and our faith. So that our Covenanting with Chriſt, and our faith is the ſame thing: that is, our accepting an offered Saviour on his terms: Or a Conſent that he be ours and we his on his terms. And who knows not that this Faith, or Covenanting, or Conſent, is the condition by us to be performed, that we may have right to Chriſt and Life offered? 3. Indeed there is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with joyned a promiſe for future duty: but mark 1. what; 2. and to what end; 1. It is principally but a promiſe of the ſame conſent to be continued, which we already give: and ſecondarily, a promiſe of ſincere obedience. 2. It is not that theſe future promiſed acts ſhall be the condition of our firſt Juſtification, or right to Chriſt; but onely the condition of the continuance of our Juſtification, it being certainly begun, and we put into a ſtate of favor and acceptance, meerly on our firſt conſent or covenanting, that is, believing or receiving Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>That all this is no ſtrange thing, (that our own Covenant Act ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Primary condition of Gods Covenant) may appear by your forementioned ſimilitudes, and all other caſes, wherein ſuch Relations are contracted. If a King will offer his Son in marriage to a condemned woman and a beggar, on condition that ſhe will but have him, that is conſent, and ſo covenant and marry him: here her covenanting, conſenting or marrying him, is the performance of the condition on her part, for obtaining her firſt Right in him and his: but for the continuance of that Right, is further requiſite, Primarily the continuance of that conſent; ſecondarily the addition of ſubjection and marriage-faithfulneſs. Yet though conſent begun, and conſent continued, be both called conſent, and are the ſame thing, it is only the beginning that is called marriage: ſo is it only begun faith, which is our marriage with Chriſt, and conſtitutes us Regenerate, or converted. And therefore you do not well to talk of <hi>Regeneration being the keeping of our Covenant.</hi> If by <hi>Regeneration</hi> you mean not Gods Act, but our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and believing, then it is our keeping Gods Covenant, by performing the condition, <hi>i. e.</hi> Our obeying him in entering his Covenant; but it is not the keeping of our own Covenant: for our making or entering Covenant, is our principal condition, on performance whereof we are juſtified; yet in ſo doing, we promiſe to continue that conſent or faith: and ſo the continuance is our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-keeping.</p>
                     <p>As for your inſtances of the Covenant of paying money, and doing work, had I uſed ſuch inſtances, what ſhould I have heard from thoſe men that already charge me with giving too much to works in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55369:54"/>
for our Lord, Redeemer, Saviour, Head and Husband in preſent and for the time to come, though the very relation conſented to, doth indeed oblige us to the future duties of that Relation. By this time, I leave it to the Reader to judge, who it is that introduced confuſion about the Covenant, and whether this be an error of the lower ſize?</p>
                     <p>As for that you adde, that <hi>then there is no Covenant-breaking</hi>; I Reply, 1. <hi>Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

As for the texts you cite, I ſay 1. The Iſraelites broke Gods commands, which are called his Covenants. 2. They broke their particular Covenants, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout reforming Idolatrie and ſuch particular ſins. 3. They broke their Verbal and equivocal Covenant or Promiſe to God, whereby they ſeemed to Accept him on his terms, but did not; and therefore had not his obligation again to them, but yet thereby obliged themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Your 2. Abſurditie is, that <hi>then there are no Hypocrites.</hi> Reply; Rather, <hi>Then all unregenerate profeſſors are Hypocrites.</hi> They pretend meerly to real proper Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting, and they do Covenant but Verbally, and equivocally. Your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to the objection therefore, <hi>pag.</hi> 211, 212, have not the leaſt ſtrength, where you ſay, The Covenant which they enter is their pretence for God; I Reply, they do therefore but pretend to take God for their God, which is the proper Covenanting. How elſe could you next ſay, that they are guiltie of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie? Doubtleſs they had hypocriſie as well in entering the Covenant, as after in pretending to ſtand to it. Is it not you rather, that conſequentially ſay, There is no Hypocrites (among theſe at leaſt) in Covenanting, who make them all to Covenant truly and unfeignedly? And where you ſay, that <hi>then they do but pretend to the ſtage, and to hypocriſie:</hi> It is a ſtrange feigned conſequence, without the leaſt ſhew of proof. What! is he but a pretender to Hypocriſie, that takes on him a Chriſtian, when he is none? (Suppoſe he never Covenanted) or he that takes on him to conſent or covenant in heart, when he doth it but in words, and wilfully diſſembles? Yea, if they think they Accept Chriſt, not knowing what Chriſt is, and ſo do not Accept him as he is offered them, and yet go on in a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that they are Chriſtians; theſe ſeem to have done what they did not, and to be what they are not: and therefore are Hypocrites, though not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely diſſembling.</p>
                     <p>For your 3. Abſurdity, I have ſaid enough againſt that charge to Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> which ſhall ſtand, till you confute it, as the confutation of yours. And ſo much for your feigned Abſurdities.</p>

But if it be the <hi>formalis Ratio</hi> of Sealing that you look at, I ſay, God ſealeth to the wicked his Covenant or Promiſe as it is made to them, (of which before): He ſealed the conditional Covenant, which they ſeemed to Accept, (which if they had not ſeemed to Accept, he would not have commanded the annexing of the Seal): and ſo God may be ſaid to do it, in that he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Miniſters to do it. But it is not ſuch a ſealing, as leaves God actually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to fulfill the promiſe, as he is to them that perform the condition. But of this more in its own place.</p>

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55369:55"/>
But I will ſhew the foulneſs of this error anon, and therefore let it paſs now. 2. But you ſay, <hi>This is plain</hi>; to whom? all men have not the truth, that are confident that they have it; I ſee that you ſay, <hi>No man is bound to make good his Condition before engagement,</hi> &amp;c. very dangerous: It is not our condition on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nor principally, as to the efficient obligation, nor at all as to the Juſtification. Are we poor worms, our own Gods and Lords, that we ſhould be diſobliged till we will be pleaſed to oblige our ſelves? Our faith is Gods Condition as the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer; three ſeveral Bonds hath he laid upon us. 1. As Legiſlator of the Law of Grace, he hath commanded us to believe in, and accept an offered Chriſt. And is Gods command inſufficient to oblige us, till we oblige our ſelves? then more happy are Pagans then I imagined. 2. As the Donor of Chriſt and Life, and the Author of the Promiſe or Deed of gift (and ſo Chriſt as Teſtator) he hath made our ſincere faith the condition; ſaying, <hi>If thou believe, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Hereby we are bound to believe, as a neceſſary means to ſalvation. This is but a ſanction of the firſt obligation. 3. The like may be ſaid of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned</hi>; which God addeth as Legiſlator to this Law, ſo that every man is bound to ſound Believing, as the neceſſarie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſalvation, before he doth conſent himſelf, or oblige himſelf to it: even by an obligation which is ten thouſand fold ſtronger then any that he is capable of laying on himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is alſo a very high miſtake, to think that our Covenanting or Conſent, (which is our actual believing) is none of our condition, when it is the great and principal part of our condition; yea all the condition of our begun Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation (not taking the word Faith too narrowly). You will perhaps ſay, Theſe are our conditions as ſubjects, but not as Covenanters. Reply. They are our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as ſubjects called to Covenant, as we are the perſons to whom the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is offered: They are conſtituted by God as Donor, Benefactor, and Author of the Covenant or Promiſe, and not meerly as Rector. It belongeth to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to determine of the conditions of his own gift, on which they ſhall become due or not. Yet doth God make no tranſactions with men but as with ſubjects; and therefore even when he deals with us as Benefactor and Donor in free gifts, it is ſtill as <hi>Dominus &amp; Rector Benefaciens</hi>: he lays not by his Dominion or Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie, nor theſe Relations to us.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. For your inſtance of ſervants and ſouldiers, they leave out the great part of the condition of the Covenant of Grace: which is, that we conſent to be ſervants and ſouldiers. The Relation muſt firſt be entered; God muſt be taken for our God, and Chriſt for our Redeemer, Lord, and Saviour; the Holy Ghoſt for our Guide and Sanctifyer: This is Faith and Covenanting. This goes before wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and fighting. But this Covenanting is the great condition of Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. As when the forementioned Prince is offered in marriage (with his Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Riches) to a condemned beggar; as it is a gift, and covenant propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on his part, and actually to be entered, it is conſent, or marriage-covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on her part that is the condition; yea, and all the condition of her firſt right to him and his riches and honors. So in your inſtance: It is the ſervants conſent or covenant to have ſuch a man for his maſter; and the ſouldiers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and covenanting to have ſuch a man for his General; that is the condition on which one hath all his firſt right to the Priviledges of the family, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Priviledges of the Armie. Is not this conſent neceſſarie in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe? If you would have ſpoke to the point, you ſhould have ſaid thus,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55369:56"/>
                        <hi>No ſervant is tyed ſincerely to conſent or covenant to be a ſervant, before he have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his earneſt: No ſouldier is tyed to conſent or covenant truly to be a ſouldier, till he be liſted</hi>; which are both plainly falſe. Baptiſm is as the liſting; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent (which is ſaving Faith) is the heart covenant, prerequiſite to liſting, and not the work to be done after, except you ſpeak of the continuance of conſent. Baptiſm is the ſolemnizing our marriage with Chriſt. And it is a ſtrange mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, wherein the woman doth only promiſe that ſhe will begin hereafter to take that man for her husband, but not at preſent. Nay where ſuch preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is not Requiſite, is a fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="5">5. In your minor, <hi>But faith that is Juſtifying to accept Chriſt, is the condition to which Baptiſm engageth</hi>; either you mean only the continuance of that faith, and that is true, (but not your meaning I think). Or you mean, the beginning of that faith (as doubtleſs the foregoing words ſhew that you do); and then why had we not one word tending to the proof, which would in this place have been very acceptable to me. I will anon make an argument of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</p>
                     <p>You ſeem to me in all this to miſtake the very formal nature of a condition, as if it received its denomination from our promiſe to perform it; when as, by the conſent of all Lawyers that I have read of it, it is denominated from the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Donor, Teſtator, or other Impoſer; and moſt evidently and unqueſtionably it is ſo, in unequal contracts, where one is the Benefactor, and hath the abſolute power of diſpoſing his own favors.</p>

All that are Diſciples unto Chriſt, and made Diſciples for Chriſt, are to be baptized: But ſome are made Diſciples to Chriſt, that are ſhort of Faith ſaving and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, as hath been proved at large: This Diſcipleſhip that Chriſt here mentions, is ſuch of which whole Nations are in capacity, as is plain in the Commiſſion; to which this Nation (with others) hath happily attained according to the manifold Propheſies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited: Of theſe the whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal viſible Church conſisteth, ſo irrefragably proved by Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> in his Treatiſe of that ſubject, and his Vindication. Now if whole Nations, yea the whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Viſible Church (conſiſting of diſcipled Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) were all Believers, it were a great happineſs; the Election would be as large as Vocation, when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Many are called, but few choſen.</hi>

                        <hi>R.B.</hi> 1. TO vindicate my Objections: If it be not ſincere Diſciples that Chriſt means in that Text, then no Apoſtle was bound by that Commiſſion and great Precept to endeavour the making of ſincere Diſciples (but only coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits and half Chriſtians:) But the Antecedent is falſe, therefore, &amp;c. 2. For your Argument, I grant the Concluſion; and what would you have more? But knew
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55369:57"/>
you not that it is not the thing in Queſtion? 3. I grant the Minor, taking the word Diſciples equivocally, as a Corps is called a man; and I confeſs it uſual ſo to take the word: but otherwiſe I deny the Minor. To be Chriſts Diſciple (as to the aged) is to be one that hath unfeignedly taken Chriſt for his Maſter, to Teach him and Rule him, renouncing the contrary guidance of the Fleſh, the World, and Devil: and it implyeth that he hath already learnt his neceſſity of Chriſts Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and who Chriſt is, and what a Maſter, &amp; to what End it is that we muſt learn of him, and what are the great conditions on which he receiveth his Diſciples. And I think they that do this ſincerely, are juſtified: and they that do not, are but ſeeming Diſciples; but if you will call ſuch Diſciples (as we muſt becauſe they ſeem ſo) then you may ſay, They are Really ſuch (ſeeming) Diſciples. 4. To your confirmation, I deny the Minor: and I ſay, that it is ſo new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to affirm that whole Nations are not capable of being ſound Believers, that it deſerved one word of proof. Much leſs ſhould you have hid your Minor, and turned it into <hi>à Negatio exiſtentiae,</hi> when it ſhould have been but <hi>à Negatio Capacitatis.</hi> Doth it follow that a Nation is not capable of ſound faith, becauſe they have it not? or will not have it? 5. Do you think Preachers yet be not bound to endeavour the ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ing Converſion of whole Nations? If you ſay, No: you take them off the work that their maſter hath ſet them on. If you ſay, Yea, then you think they muſt endeavor to perſwade men to that which they have not a capacity of. 6. If there be any Nation uncapable of Faith, then God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make them Believers. But that is not true, therefore, &amp;c. 7. You ſay not well that the whole Univerſal Viſible Church conſiſteth of Diſcipled Nations, if you mean [only] as you ſeem. For then poor ſcattered Chriſtians in a Heathen Nation, ſhould be no part of the Univerſal Viſible Church. 8. Vocation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, is common to Pagans. Vocation throughly effectual, is of the ſame extent as juſtification, and (I think) Election. Vocation which is effectual on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bring men to an outward Profeſſion of ſaving Faith, is larger then Election, and makes men ſuch whom we are bound to Baptize.</p>

                        <hi>R. B.</hi> IF affirmations be good proof of the weakneſs of Arguments, then this is ſufficiently confuted. But to the reſt: 1. I confeſs there may be a <hi>Hyſteron Proteron</hi> in the Scripture: and in ſuch a caſe we may not gather the reall precedency of that which is firſt named. But otherwiſe, I know not whence we ſhould better gather the natural order then from Scripture order in expreſſion. If I may by the order of your ſpeeches gather the order of things in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and intentions, then may I obſerve the Holy Ghoſts order alſo to the like ends: for I ſuppoſe you ſpeak not more orderly then the Holy Ghoſt. But I may ſure to that end obſerve the order of your expreſſions, therefore. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, this is not one Text going againſt the order expreſſed in moſt others: but contrarily, the ſame order is uſually obſerved in other Texts that ſpeak of Faith and Baptiſm, putting Faith firſt. Furthermore, this is not a meer Hiſtorical Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or circumſtantial by-paſſage, but it is the very ſum of the Law of Grace, ſolemnly delivered by Chriſt to his Apoſtles (with their grand Commiſſion) before his Aſcention: and where may we expect if not here; where in ſo few words is expreſſed the ſubſtance of the Covenant? Moreover, it is not doctrinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in general precepts onely, that this order is held, but in particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> directing in preſent matter of execution. The Eunuch muſt Believe with all his heart, and ſo others commonly muſt profeſs belief, before they muſt be Baptized: and the Scripture gives no hint that this is one kinde of Faith, and that another, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.4. ſhews firſt in General what <hi>John</hi> did in the wilderneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptize: and 2. in what order he did it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>viz.</hi> firſt preaching that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Repentance to them. That 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. is ſpoken in perfect Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal order: It ſpeaks not of Chriſts order of Execution, and our order of Aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but of Gods and our order of Intention. If it had been ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>he giveth us glory and vertue,</hi> it had been a <hi>Hyſteron Proteron</hi>: but it is only, <hi>he called us to glory and vertue:</hi> And of ends the Ultimate is the firſt in Intention, and all ends are ſo before their means; and therefore may well be ſo in expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

In every ſtipulation they make two parties, the Stipulator (which is he that asks the queſtion) and the Promiſer (which is the anſwerer, that obligeth himſelf). Though rarely and unuſually alſo, the Promiſer be called Stipulator. But I ſuppoſe it is <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſio Promiſſoris,</hi> that you mean by Reſtipulation, and not another Interogation whereby a double ſtipulation is made; ſuppoſing this your meaning I Reply: 1. Why did you not give us one word for proof, that this Reſtipulation is a thing following Baptiſm? This is too dilute and eaſie diſputing. I took the contrary for an unqueſtionable truth. The beſt Interpreters judge, that <hi>Peter</hi> means here, the Anſwer whereby the Promiſer in Baptiſm did ſolemnly oblige himſelf: which was to two Queſtions. <hi>Credis in Patrem, filium &amp; ſpiritum ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum? Credo. Abrenuncias Diabolum, mundum &amp; Carnem? Abrenuncio.</hi> And who knoweth not that theſe went before the application of the water? (of which more anon.) Doth not mutual conſent expreſſed go before the ſealing of the Covenant? Doth Chriſt bid us Baptize men into the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy-Ghoſt; and would you have us do this before they profeſs their conſent? ſhall we Baptize them firſt, and ask them whether they believe and conſent after?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I gratefully accept your Conceſſion, that <hi>Juſtifying Faith is that Reſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Which is your minor: (that is, Juſtifying Faith, profeſſed). And thence I conclude, that then Juſtifying faith is Eſſential to the mutual Covenant, and ſo without it, God is not thus in Covenant with men: For who knows not, that ever read Civil Law, that there is no ſtipulation <hi>ſine Promiſsione,</hi> which you call (and ſo do other Divines) Reſtipulation? and that this Reſtipulation is an eſſential part of the contract, called ſtipulation? This being paſt doubt, it follows, that Juſtifying Faith being our Reſtipulation, is an Eſſential part of the contract or Baptiſmal Covenant. And it is apparant that <hi>Peter</hi> meant not any other contract which was to be entered between God and man, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Baptiſmal Contract, and different from it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for then he would not have ſaid <hi>Baptiſm ſaveth us</hi>; and have interpreted it, <hi>de fidâ reſponſione vel promiſsione, &amp; non de nudâ lotione.</hi>

                        <hi>Mr. Bl. OBj. 3. That faith to which the promiſe of Remiſsion and Juſtification is made, it muſt alſo be ſealed to, (or that faith which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Promiſe, is the condition in</hi> foro Dei <hi>of the Title to the Seal). But it is only ſolid true faith which is the Condition of the Promiſe (of Remiſſion). Therefore it is that only that gives Right in</hi> foro Dei, <hi>to the Seal.</hi> Anſw. Here is an argument firſt propoſed; <hi>2.</hi> in a parentheſis paraphraſed: For the propoſition, I ſay, Faith is not ſealed to, but Remiſsion of ſins, or ſalvation upon condition of Faith. A profeſſor of Faith that goes no further, may engage himſelf to a lively working Faith, and upon thoſe terms, God engages for, and puts his Seal for Remiſsion and ſalvation. For the parentheſis, <hi>That faith which is the condition of the Promiſe, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in</hi> foro Dei <hi>of Title to that Seal;</hi> I judge the contrary to be undeniable, that Faith which is the condition of the Promiſe, is not the condition in <hi>foro Dei,</hi> of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the Seal. An acknowledgment of the Neceſsity of ſuch faith, with engagement to it, is ſufficient for a Title to the Seal, and the performance of the condition of like neceſsity to attain the thing ſealed. To promiſe ſervice and fidelitie in war, is enough to get liſted, as to do ſervice is of neceſsity to be rewarded.</p>

As in the Lords Supper; Taking and eating, is our Sealing, profeſſing action; ſo in Baptiſm, receiving the water applied, is our Seal and profeſſing Paſſion: (For we are more Paſſive in our new birth, then in our feeding for growth). So is the preſenting our perſons, or our children, of our delivering them up to Chriſt, as his Diſciples. It is therefore our part, as well as Gods, that is Sealed to.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Where you ſay, <hi>A profeſſor of Faith may engage to a lively working Faith</hi>; you mean, either <hi>a Profeſſor of that lively faith,</hi> or <hi>a Profeſſor of a dead, not work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith.</hi> If the firſt, it is a contradiction to ſay, <hi>He profeſſeth to have a lively Faith</hi>; and <hi>He only engageth ſo to believe hereafter.</hi> For if he profeſs to have it already, then he can engage only to the Continuation, and not the Inception of it. If you mean the latter, then I ſhall ſhew you anon, that a man profeſſing a Dead, not-working Faith, is not in Scripture called to Covenant with God in Baptiſm, to believe lively for the future, (<hi>incepivè</hi>) and to believe for the future with a working Faith. In the mean time, this ſhould be proved, which yet I never ſaw. You ſuppoſe then, ſuch a profeſſor as this, coming to Baptiſm, ſaying, <hi>Lord I believe that Thou art God alone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Chriſt the only Redeemer, and the Holy-Ghoſt, the Guide and Sanctifier of thy people; and that the World, Fleſh, and Devil is to be renounced for thee: but at preſent theſe are ſo dear to me, that I will not forſake them for thee; I will not take Thee for my God, to Rule me, or be my Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor will I take Chriſt to Govern me, and Save me in His way, nor will I be Guided or Sanctified by the Holy-Ghoſt; but hereafter I will, &amp; therefore I come to be Baptized.</hi>

If the Promiſe and Seal have two diſtinct conditions, then there are two diſtinct Covenants (for from the conditions, moſt commonly are contracts ſpecified: and therefore <hi>Weſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bechius</hi> and ſuch like Logical Civilians, call it the form of the contract, or ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to be either <hi>Dura vel in diem, vel ſub conditione,</hi> and thoſe ſub-conditions are ſpecified oft from their various conditions). But there is not two Covenants, therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but of this more anon.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Is it not againſt the nature and common uſe of Sealing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it ſhould be in order before the Promiſe or Covenant? and that men ſhould have firſt right to that Seal on one condition, before they have right to the Promiſe; and then have right to the Promiſe after on another condition? 5. If it be ſo undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that <hi>that Faith which is the condition of the Promiſe, is not the condition in</hi> fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro Dei <hi>of Title to the Seal</hi>; as you affirm: why do you then build ſo much againſt <hi>Mr. Tombes,</hi> on that argument from Act. 2. <hi>The Promiſe is to you and your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>; arguing a Right to the Seal, from an Intereſt in the Promiſe?</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Where you ſay, that <hi>An acknowledgement of the neceſſity of ſuch faith, with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to it, is ſufficient for a Title to the Seal.</hi> I Reply, then thoſe that at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent renounce Chriſt, ſo it be againſt their knowledge and conſcience, and will engage to own him ſincerely for the future, have right to Baptiſm. A convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced perſecutor may acknowledge this neceſſity, and engage, that before he dies he will be a true Believer, and yet reſolve to be no Chriſtian till then, no not ſo much as in profeſſion.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Your inſtance of ſervice &amp; fidelitie in war, runs upon the great miſtake which I have ſo often told you of. The formal Reaſon and denomination of a condition, is from the Donors conſtitution or impoſition, giving his benefits only on the terms by himſelf aſſigned; and not from our Promiſe to perform them. And therefore our Promiſe it ſelf, is the chief condition of Gods Promiſe, and (to ſpeak as your ſelf did). Our Juſtifing faith being our Reſtipulation, that Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation is not only part of our condition, but the whole as to our firſt Right to Chriſt, Juſtification and Salvation; though that Right ſhall not be continued, nor we actually glorified, but on condition both of continuing that faith, and of adding (if there be opportunitie) ſincere obedience, in perſeverance to the death.</p>

                     <p>It may be anſwered, that a Dogmatical faith is true faith, <hi>ſuo genere,</hi> as well as that which Juſtifieth; therefore I know not why men ſhould give it the term of falſe Faith, ſeeing Scripture calls it <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſuch as thoſe <hi>Believers,</hi> and the heart in ſuch a Faith (as to an entire aſſent) is required. If we look into the Eunuchs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, in which <hi>Philip</hi> did reſt ſatisfied, and proceeded upon it to baptiſm, it will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all ſcruple: his anſwer is, I believe that Jeſus Christ is the Son of God: There is no more in that then a common Faith: this is believed by men not juſtified: yet this Faith entitles to baptiſm, and upon this confeſsion of Faith the Eunuch is baptized.</p>

                        <hi>R. B.</hi> THat will not trouble you, which troubleth others. To your anſwer I Reply, 1. When we do, with the Scriptures, enquire after Faith in Chriſt crucified, we may well call that a falſe Faith which pretends to be this, and is not this, however true in <hi>ſuo genere.</hi> Faith in <hi>Jupiter, Sol, Mahomet,</hi> is true in <hi>ſuo genere</hi>: and ſo is humane Faith: yet I would call it a falſe Faith, if this ſhould be pretended to be Faith in Chriſt. To believe in Chriſt as man only, or as God only, or as a Guide to Heaven only, and not as a Redeemer by ranſom, or as one that is to juſtifie us, but not to Sanctifie or Rule us; each of theſe is true in <hi>ſuo genere,</hi> but falſe if they pretend to be that which Scripture calls Faith in Chriſt, and which denominateth Believers. So is it to believe with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſpeculatively and ſuperficially, and yet to Diſſent with the will. I think, if a man ſay, <hi>This is the Son, the heir, come let us kill him, and the inheritance ſhall be ours; we will not have this man Reign over us:</hi> that theſe are not true Believers, nor have right to Baptiſm, though their belief that he is the heir, be a Dogmatical Faith, true in its kinde.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As <hi>Ameſius Medulla li.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. §. 20. <hi>Quamvis in Scripturis aliquando Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſus veritati quae eſt de Deo &amp; Chriſto, Joh.</hi> 1.50. <hi>habetur pro vera fide, includitur tamen ſemper ſpecialis fiducia, atque adeo omnibus in locis ubi ſermo eſt de ſalutari fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, vel praeſupponitur fiducia in Meſsiam, &amp; indicatur tantum determinatio vel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatio ejus ad perſonam Jeſu Chriſti, vel per aſſenſum illum deſignatur, tanquam ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectum

per ſuam cauſam.</hi> And as words of Knowledge and Aſſent, do in Scripture oft imply affection and conſent, ſo on the contrary, words of conſent and affection do alwaies imply Knowledge and Aſſent. And therefore Faith is ſometime denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the Intellectual act <hi>Believing,</hi> and ſometime from the Wills act <hi>Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Do you not know how ordinarily even ſaving Faith it ſelf is denominated from the Intellectual Act alone? when yet you'l confeſs the Will is neceſſarily an Agent in this? many texts might quickly be cited to that end. Thoſe that <hi>Ameſius</hi> citeth may ſuffice: <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.25, 26, 27. <hi>He that believeth in me ſhall live. Believeſt thou this? yea Lord, I believe that thou art that Chriſt the Son of God, that was to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world.</hi> Such was <hi>Nathaniels</hi> faith. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.49, 50. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall confeſs that Jeſus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and be in God.</hi> And 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Whoſoever believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God.</hi> Here is more then Right to Baptiſm. The great doubt was then whether Chriſt were the true <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> and therefore this was the greateſt and moſt difficult part of Faith, to Aſſent to this; and therefore the whole is denominated from it, it being ſuppoſed, when they believed him to be the only ſufficient and faithful Phyſitian, that they were willing to be healed by him in his way.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. If you think, as you ſeem by your anſwer to do, that a man may Aſſent to the Truth of the Goſpel with all his heart, and yet be void of Juſtifying Faith, you do not lightly err. Though an unregenerate man may believe as many truths as the Regenerate, yet not with all his heart; Chriſt ſaith <hi>Math.</hi> 13. <hi>The word hath not rooting in him.</hi> Doubtleſs, whether or no the Practical underſtanding do unavoidably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Will, yet God doth not ſanctifie the underſtanding truly, and leave the Will unſanctified: which muſt be ſaid, if the Dogmatical Faith, that is the Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Aſſent of a wicked man, be as ſtrong as that of a true Believer. Dr. <hi>Downam</hi> in his Treatiſe of Juſtification, and againſt Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> hath ſaid enough of this, to which I refer you.

From Authority (beginning with the loweſt Argument). The Reverend Aſſembly in their Advice for Church Government, Printed after the Directory, pag. 58. of the Church ſay thus, <hi>Particular Churches in the Primitive times were made up of Viſible Saints.</hi> viz. <hi>of ſuch as being of Age, profeſſed faith

And if ſo, then it is not a Faith ſhort of this which is the condition of Church member-ſhip; for then the profeſſion of that other imperfect Faith might ſuffice; of which more anon. See alſo the Aſſemblies Confeſſion. cap. 28. §. 1.6. and the two Catechiſms of Baptiſm, where 1. obſerve the ends of Baptiſm, that it Sealeth Remiſſion, Regeneration, Adoption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. the ſubject, that none are to be Baptized at age till they profeſs their Faith in Chriſt and Obedience to him.

If it be required in Baptiſm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that men do ſincerely promiſe for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to Believe ſavingly, and to obey Chriſt ſincerely, then Iuſtifying Faith is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in Baptiſm.

Now I would know of him, whether God require them to make this engagement ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, ſincerely, <hi>&amp; firmato animo,</hi> or not? If not, then God calls them but to Diſſemble, which is not true. If yea; then I ſay, This is juſtifying Faith it ſelf, or at leaſt comes from it, if it be a Promiſe to do this preſently without delay. For he that will heartily engage himſelf to obey Chriſt as his Soveraign, and reſt on him for ſalvation, muſt needs be reſolved ſo to do. But he that is ſo reſolved, is a true
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55369:61"/>
Believer: For his will is ſanctified; or elſe he could not be thus reſolved. But if it be only for ſo long time hence, that a man promiſeth to believe and obey ſincerely, with a reſerve and reſolution to live wickedly till then, I hope few will believe that this is the condition of Baptiſm, or the true Baptiſmal Covenant.</p>

                        <hi>Argu.</hi> 4. They that are to Renounce the World, Fleſh, and Devil, are to be true believers (to juſtification); but they that are to be baptized, are then to Renounce the World, Fleſh and Devil: therefore &amp;c. The major is evident, in that renounce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe, is a renounceing them as Rulers that would command us before God, or as worldly, fleſhly pleaſures or profits, might ſeem our chief good, to be preferred before God. Now it is none but the ſincere believer that can ſo renounce theſe. All others are ſervants to them, and make them their end. The Minor is proved thus. 1. There can be no <hi>motus</hi> to the <hi>Terminus ad quem,</hi> but there muſt alſo be a <hi>Terminus à quo.</hi> The World, Fleſh and Devil, are the <hi>Terminus à quo</hi>; without which we cannot be ſaid to take God for our God, or Chriſt for our Lord-Redeemer. 2. <hi>De facto,</hi> this Abre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation hath been uſed in the Churches Baptiſm, ever ſince the Apoſtles days, as far as we have any Hiſtory to guide us. <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian,</hi> and all Antiquity <hi>uno ore</hi> that write of theſe things, put that paſt queſtion. And I dare not think that Chriſts Church hath ever required that as neceſſary in Baptiſm, which was not requiſite till afterward. And if Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> ſay, that they did but promiſe for the future, not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the World, Fleſh and Devil before Chriſt: <hi>I</hi> Reply, They renounced them at preſent, and thereby ſhewed the preſent converſion and Reſolution of their hearts, that it was afterward that this was to be manifeſted in action.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argu.</hi> 5. They that are required to believe ſincerely in the Father, Son and Holy-Ghoſt, are required to believe to Juſtification. But ſuch are all that come to baptiſm. Therefore. For the major, it requires no more proof, but to explain what it is to believe in the Father, Son and Holy-Ghoſt. And our Divines againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts have enough proved, that the phraſe of <hi>Believing in,</hi> comprehendeth the act of the will as well as of the underſtanding. To believe in God, is to take him for our God: to take him for our God, is to take him for our Soveraign, Ruler and Chief good. This none but a ſound believer can truly do. Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> confeſſeth elſwhere, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>his is the ſumme of the Covenant, to take God for our God, &amp; give up our ſelves to be his people.</p>
                     <p>For the Minor: They that are to be baptized into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy-Ghoſt, are to believe in the Father, Son, and Holy-Ghoſt. But all that are baptized, are to be baptized into the name of the Father, Son and Holy-Ghoſt; therefore.</p>
                     <p>Were it neceſſary, many Texts might be cited that prove it is not only Aſſent, but a believing in Chriſt, that is requiſite. The very Creed ſhews it, which hath <hi>Credo in Deum,</hi> &amp;c. which Creed, for the main Articles of it, the Church hath ever required all to profeſs, that would be baptized, before the application of the water. And then that this is required to be done <hi>ſincerely,</hi> needs no proof with them that will not believe that God commands or loves diſſembling. So that I conclude, This ſincere Faith is required in and before baptiſm, and not only to be promiſed that we will perform it hereafter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argu.</hi> 6. They that are required to repent ſincerely are required to believe to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication at the ſame time. But all that come to baptiſm (at age) are required to repent ſincerely; therefore.</p>
                     <p>The major is evident, 1. In that ſincere Repentance and true Faith are inſepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. 2. In that Remiſſion is promiſed to all that truly Repent, as well as to them that believe. The Minor is proved from ſeveral plain Scriptures. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent

and be Baptized every one of you in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt for the Remiſsion of ſins</hi>: And it was no half or common Repentance that he calls them to; for Remiſſion of ſins was to be its Conſequent. If Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> ſay here alſo, That it is the weakeſt of all Arguments, to argue from the order expreſſed in Scripture: I ſhall ſay I will not believe him; becauſe I ſuppoſe Scripture in ſuch Practical directions, ſpeaks not more confuſedly or prepoſterouſly then he or I would do: <hi>Act.</hi> 11.18.

And <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Repentance from dead works is a Principle.

Objectively, I hope he will not deny but it is every ſin, that men ſhould repent of. 2. Subjectively, it is doubtleſs, ſincere, and not counterfeit, that is required. I conclude therefore, that ſeeing ſaving Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is prerequiſite to Baptiſm, by Gods appointment, and not only to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be afterward performed, we muſt ſay the ſame of ſaving Faith.</p>

                     <p>The Conſequence of the major is all that requires proof. Which I prove from many Texts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.2.6, 8. He firſt preacheth Repentance, and cauſeth them to confeſs their ſins, and reprehendeth the <hi>Phariſes</hi> that came in Hypocriſie, or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with unſound Repentance. And it was true Repentance; for Remiſſion of ſins was annext, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.4. And it may not only be required after Baptiſm, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and it is called the Baptiſm of Repentance, becauſe in it they profeſſed Repentance. So <hi>Act.</hi> 13.24 and 19.4.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argu.</hi> 8. If Faith-Juſtifying be required before Remiſſion of ſin, then is it required of God before we come to Baptiſm (or in us before we bring our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants). But ſuch Faith is prerequiſite to Remiſſion of ſin; therefore.</p>
                     <p>The conſequence is proved thus. Remiſſion is the end and immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of Baptiſm, where men come as God hath required them. Therefore, if ſincere Faith be prerequiſite to Remiſſion, it is prerequiſite alſo to right to Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>I prove the Antecedent: <hi>Act.</hi> 22.16. <hi>Ananias</hi> ſaith to <hi>Paul, Why tarryeſt thou? ariſe and be baptized, and waſh away thy ſins.</hi> This was a preſent Remiſſion, and not a future only. So <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. <hi>Be baptized every one of you, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt for the Remiſsion of ſins.</hi> And it is a Faith which hath the Promiſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which <hi>Peter</hi> requires of the Gentils before he baptize them. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.39. the Apoſtle tells them, <hi>All that belive are Juſtified,</hi> when he is perſwading them to believe. It is therefore a believing to Juſtification, which he was perſwading them to. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4. <hi>Know ye not, that as many as were Baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, were baptized into his death? therefore we are buryed with him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of wrath afterward. 2. In that the Anſwer of a good conſcience is required to concurr with Baptiſm: for ſo the Apoſtle plainly intimates, and the beſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors underſtand it, and not of a thing to follow, as Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> doth. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25, 26. <hi>Chriſt loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the word.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſeth them cleanſed that are Baptized: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Such were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are Juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. And Expoſitors judge that the Holy-Ghoſt refers to the ſign as well as the thing ſignified, to the Sacrament as well as Subſtance, when he makes waſhing ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and ſpeaks of waſhing us from our ſins in the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Though he make them not equal in neceſsity.</hi> Joh. 3.5. <hi>Except a man be born of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 10.22. <hi>Let us draw neer with a true heart, in full aſſurance of faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, and our bodyes waſhed with pure water.</hi> If it be the end of Baptiſm, to waſh our hearts from an evil conſcience, <hi>(i. e. à Conſcientia mali.)</hi> then it is the end of Baptiſm, to Seal the preſent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin: But &amp;c. therefore, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>He ſaved us by the waſhing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation</hi>: It is a ſaving work that Baptiſm is appointed to do. By Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration I underſtand, our new Relative ſtate, at leaſt principally. He that is in Chriſt is a new creature; old things are paſſed away; behold all things are become new. He hath a new head, is a member of a new ſocietie, the old guilt of ſin is done away, the old enmity between God and us; we have a new Father, new brethren, new right to farther bleſſings, as well as a new heart. Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is too narrowly taken for a Renovation of the heart alone. So that I think Remiſſion and Reconciliation and Adoption, are meant by Regeneration, in <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. and <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. The ſpeaking of Baptiſm, and the heart-cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion therein received or profeſſed, ſaith, they <hi>put off the body of the ſins of the fleſh, by the circumciſion of Chriſt, being buryed with him in Baptiſm,</hi> &amp;c. So in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He that lacketh theſe things is blinde, and cannot ſee far off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old ſins:</hi> that is Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, and as far as the Church could go in purifying him: which ſhews that the end of Baptiſm is (by obſignation and ſolemnization) to purge men from their old ſins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, The ſins that are paſt, through the forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. So that Remiſſion of ſins at preſent, being the end of Baptiſm rightly received, it muſt needs follow that Juſtifying faith is prerequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the right receiving it, and that it is not ſome other Faith, nor is it enough to promiſe Juſtifying Faith for hereafter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argu.</hi> 9. If the Apoſtles uſe to communicate the proper Titles of the Juſtified to all that are Baptized, (till they ſee them prove apoſtates or hypocrites) then they did take all the Baptized to be probably juſtified (though they might know that there were hypocrites among them, yet either they knew them not, or might not denominate the body from a few that they did know) But the Antecedent is true; therefore.</p>
                     <p>I need not cite Scriptures to prove that the baptized are called by the Apoſtles, Believers, Saints, Diſciples, Chriſtians: Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> hath done it already, <hi>chap.</hi> 28. Now who knows not that ſalvation is made the Portion of Believers, Saints, Diſciples? But what, is it another ſort of them? or doth Scripture uſe to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Saints, as the Genus into two Species? Not that I know of; It is but as an <hi>aequivocum in ſua aequivocata</hi>: The Apoſtles naming men according to their appearance and Profeſsion, and calling them ſuch as they probably might be.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55369:63"/>
Why elſe ſhould they call them ſuch, had not they ſeemed to be ſuch, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed it? The names therefore do not primarily agree to theſe as a true Species of Believers, Saints, Diſciples, Chriſtians; but ſecondarily, as the name of a man to a Corps, or as the name of a Habit to a diſpoſition, by tranſlation, or Analogie.</p>
                     <p>But to put the matter beyond doubt, I wiſh Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> to conſider, that its not only theſe forementioned titles, but even the reſt which he will acknowledge proper to the Regenerate, which are given by the Apoſtles generally to the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. Adoption is aſcribed to them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26, 27. <hi>For yee are all the children of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus: for as many of you as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt.</hi> 2.

Yea the like he ſaith of their ſalvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5, 6, 7, 8. yea he tells them verſe 19. <hi>Now therefore ye are no more ſtrangers and ſorreiners, but fellow-Citizens with the Saints and of the houſhold of God</hi>; and leſt any ſhould think that <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Citizens,</hi> and <hi>the houſhold of God,</hi> do here ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie but common Priviledges of the viſible Church, he addes, <hi>And are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner-Stone, in whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth to an holy Temple in the Lord; in whom you alſo are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.</hi> Where moſt planly the Church is manifeſted to be but one, and that one to have ſaving Priviledges, and conſequently, thoſe that have not theſe, to be but equivocally Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>Many more texts might be produced, where the moſt particular Priviledges of the Saints are given to whole Churches in common: which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> that the name is by Analogy or equivocally given from the ſincere, to the reſt, becauſe we are to judge and denominate on probabilities.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argu.</hi> 10. If the profeſsion of Juſtifying Faith be requiſite in Baptiſm, then the Faith ſo profeſſed is requiſite to the right receiving of it (and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be performed hereafter.) But ſuch profeſsion is requiſite; therefore.</p>
                     <p>The major is as true, as that God requireth no man to lye and diſſemble, and to profeſs that with his mouth which is not in his heart: nor doth he make lying the condition of his Covenant, (let them call it an outward Covenant, or what they will: if it be Gods Covenant, this can be none of the condition.) For it muſt firſt in order be a Dutie, before it be made Conditional. And no lye is a Dutie. Profeſsing is a Dutie to them that have the thing they profeſs: but to others, immediately and in <hi>ſenſu compoſito,</hi> it is a hainous ſin, and no duty: though it be their duty ſtill to get Faith firſt, and then to profeſs it.</p>
                     <p>The minor is proved already, in the foregoing arguments, and more ſhall be anon. It is no leſs then juſtifying Faith that Chriſts Church hath ever to this day required the Baptized to profeſs before the application of the water. To
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55369:63"/>
believe in God the Father, Son and Holy-Ghoſt, and profeſs Repentance for all ſins, and to renounce the world, the fleſh and Devil, &amp;c. And when Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> maketh profeſſion enough to give Right to baptiſm, I would know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he mean the profeſsion of Juſtifying-Faith, or not. If yea, then Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith is prerequiſite, or elſe the profeſsion of it could not. If not, then the profeſsion of true Chriſtianity is not requiſite; but of ſome part of it. For, as I have ſhewed, it is not the true Chriſtian Faith, but ſome part of it only, if it be ſhort of that Faith which is juſtifying. And let men ſay no more, that profeſsion is it that entitles to Baptiſm, without the thing profeſſed, when they take even profeſsion it ſelf of true Chriſtianitie to be conſequential, and not prerequiſite.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argu.</hi> 11. If Baptiſm be the ſolemnizing of the myſtical marriage between Chriſt and the baptized, then true juſtifying Faith is of God required thereto: but the Antecedent is true; therefore.</p>
                     <p>Therefore is it ſaid that we are baptized <hi>into Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>into one body.</hi> And the Church hath ever held the Antecedent to be true. The conſequence is evident; in that no man but the ſound believer, can truly take Chriſt as a Husband and Head; for ſo to do, is juſtifying Faith. It is Chriſt himſelf firſt in order, and then his benefits that are offered in the Sacraments. The main buſineſs of them is to exhibite Chriſt himſelf to be received by a marriage Covenanting. The ſigns are but means and inſtruments, as a twig and turfe and Key in giving poſſeſsion; When the miniſter in Chriſts name ſaith, Take, Eat, &amp;c. it is not only bread that he bids men take, but firſt and principally Chriſt by Faith. <hi>Joahimus Vadianus (Aphoriſm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de Euchariſt. li.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 82.) much commendeth a ſaying of <hi>Chryſoſtoms,</hi> viz. <hi>If thou hadſt no body, then Christ would have delivered thee all theſe gifts nakedly (or immediately): but becauſe thy Soul is conjoyned with a body, he hath delivered them in and with theſe ſenſible things.</hi> It is one of the greateſt errors that can be committed in the Sacraments, to overlook Chirſt himſelf who is offered, and to look only either to the ſigns or to his other gifts. We receive him firſt as our Saviour, our Soveraign, Redeemer, our Head, our Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, our Captain and Guide.

                     <p>Men are oft in Scripture called to Repent and Believe; but nowhere (that I know of) to Covenant with God that they will hereafter begin to do it ſincerely; much leſs is there ſuch a Covenant ſealed with Baptiſm. They that affirm ſuch a thing, let them prove it, if they can.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argu.</hi> 13. If according to Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> Doctrine no true ſound Believer, or Penitent perſon, can regularly be baptized; then his Doctrine is unſound. But the Antecedent is true; therefore.</p>
                     <p>The conſequence is proved before. The Antecedent is proved thus: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Doctrine, ſaving Faith, accepting Chriſt to Juſtification, is the great condition to which Baptiſm engageth, and is not prerequiſite therein.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55369:64"/>
Therefore he that already performeth that condition, is paſt ſuch engageing to do it initially hereafter: and ſo hath no uſe for baptiſm as to that engagement to the great condition: ſo that if ſuch a perſon be baptized, it muſt be to other ends then the Ordinance is appointed for, and ſo not Regularly. The like may be ſaid of Gods part? for to ſuch a Believer God ſhould Seal Remiſsion paſt or preſent; whereas according to Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> the Ordinance is inſtituted to ſeal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion future.</p>

                     <p>It would be tedious and needleſs to the Intelligent, to heap up Scripture proof of the minor, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Goſpel preached before baptiſm, is appointed for an ordinary means of working true converſion. We ſee it was ordinarily done, elſe Preachers could not endeavor it, or hope or pray for it. The conſequence is manifeſt, in that Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> makes this true juſtifying Faith, and conſequently true Repentance, to be not prerequiſite to baptiſm, but to be engaged for as to the future performance. And therefore regularly it muſt be only the word after Baptiſm that muſt truly Convert, or not at all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argu.</hi> 15. If Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> Doctrine be true, then regularly it muſt be ſuppoſed that all perſons are in a ſtate of damnation immediately on their baptiſm; and if they then dyed, ſhould periſh. But the conſequent is falſe; therefore ſo is the Antecedent.</p>
                     <p>For the Conſequence; if Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> mean, that it is any ſpace of time after baptiſm that we engage to begin our juſtifying Faith in, then the conſequence is undenyable: for till then, the perſon is unjuſtified. But if he mean that in baptiſm they muſt engage to believe to Juſtification in the ſame inſtant of time, then this is to make ſuch Faith neceſſary in the inſtant of baptiſm; and this is but an evident vanity, to ſuppoſe a man not believing to juſtification, who yet can and muſt promiſe to do it in the ſame inſtant, or the next.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argu.</hi> 16. If it be only true juſtifying Faith that gives men right <hi>coram Deo</hi> (by vertue of his Covenant) to the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>The conſequence is proved, 1. In that the Sacraments are both Seals of the ſame Covenant. 2. It is right to Church-priviledges in general that Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> aſcribes to his Dogmatical Faith, and therefore to one Sacrament as well as the other. For the Antecedent, I think our brethren that would ſo fain keep the Church and Ordinances pure, would hardly admit a man to the Lords Table, that they were ſure did not take Chriſt for his Lord, or that would ſay, I believe all the Creed and Word of God, but I will not have Chriſt Reign over me at the preſent, but I promiſe that hereafter. I will ſee Doctor <hi>Drake</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>Humfrey,</hi> whether they would admit ſuch. <hi>Hierom</hi> argues thus, from Baptiſm, to the Adminiſtration of the Lords Supper: therefore I may do it as to the receiving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        <hi>Argu.</hi> 17. That Doctrine which feigneth an un-ſealed Covenant for giving right to the Seal of the Covenant of Grace, is unſound: But ſuch is Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi>; therefore.</p>
                     <p>No Scripture can be brought to prove ſuch an outward Covenant of Gods: And it is againſt the common reaſon and cuſtom of men, that a ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhould be drawn to convey right to the Seal of the firſt Covenant, ſeeing right to Covenant and Seal go together: and if there muſt be another Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to give right to that, then by the ſame reaſon there muſt be another to give right to that, and another to that, and ſo <hi>in infinitum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the Antecedent, it is apparent that Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> diſtinguiſheth <hi>ex parte Dei,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the outward and the inward Covenant. It is probable that he thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributes them from the bleſsings promiſed, whereof ſome are inward, and ſome outward: for though he explain not himſelf fully, yet I know no other ſenſe that it will bear. It is evident that his outward Covenant hath no Seal. For it is a Covenant <hi>de ſigillis conferendis.</hi> If therefore it have a Seal, it is either the ſame which is promiſed, or ſome other. Other I never heard of: they no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where tell us what is the Seal of their outward Covenant. The ſame it cannot be: for the ſame thing cannot be the <hi>materia foederis</hi> or the Legacy it ſelf, or the benefit given, and the Seal too of that Covenant whereby it is given.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argu.</hi> 18. That Doctrine which makes it the regular way in Baptiſm for all men to promiſe that which they can neither ſincerely promiſe nor perform, is unſound: but ſuch is Mr. <hi>Blakes,</hi> therefore.</p>
                     <p>The diſabilitie which I here ſpeak of, is not ſuch as is in a Godly man, to do any good without Chriſt and the Spirit, as is in the ſecond cauſe to act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the firſt: or in a partial cauſe, to act without its compartial: but ſuch as is in an unregenerate man to do the work of the Regenerate; or in any broken inſtrument, or diſabled agent, to do its own part of the work till it be altered, and made another thing, as it were. For the conſequence, it is evident in that, 1. No man ſhould ever perform Gods command concerning covenanting. 2. And no mans word were fit to be taken concerning the performance of his own Covenant. 1. Whether God may or do command ſome men, or all men, that which they have not abilitie to perform, is nothing to the point. For yet he gives ſome of them abilitie, and cauſeth them to perform it, when he makes it neceſſarie to ſalvation. But in this caſe God ſhould enable no man (regularly) to that Baptiſmal Covenant which he commandeth, nor ſhould any obey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. For he commandeth them ſincerely to take him for their God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to Love, Believe, and Obey him hereafter. (For to diſſemble, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands none). But this no unrenewed Soul can do, or ever did to this day. They cannot reſolve it; therefore they cannot ſincerely promiſe it; and if juſtifying Faith muſt regularly begin after baptiſm (as being the great condition to which it engages, and not prerequiſite) then it is only unregenerate men that are the regular ſubjects of baptiſm. 2. And its plain that he who cannot ſincerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, (and therefore doth it diſſemblingly, or with a half heart) nor is able to perform his promiſe, is not to be credited. God himſelf never enableth an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man, to believe and repent ſavingly, while he is ſuch, <hi>in ſenſu compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſito</hi>: and therefore is it likely that it is ordinarily and regularly ſuch dead men that muſt Covenant to Repent and Believe to juſtification? Renewing Grace muſt intercede, which is not in their hand: how then can they promiſe to do
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55369:65"/>
the works of the truly Gracious. God may invite and command the dead to live, yea and to do the works of the living, becauſe he gave them life, and gives them means for revival. But I know not where he calls ſuch men to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to do it: much leſs is the conſtant Baptiſmal Covenant ſuch.</p>

If the Diſtribution of the Church into viſible and inviſible, be but of the ſubject by divers Adjuncts, and not of a <hi>Genus</hi> into its <hi>Species,</hi> then that part, or thoſe members which are meerly viſible, are indeed no part or members of the Church ſo diſtributed, (but are only equivocally called a Church, Chriſtians, Church-Members, &amp;c.) But the Antecedent is true; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>The Antecedent is not only the common Doctrine of the Reformed Divines againſt the Papiſts, but is expreſsly affirmed by Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> in this his Book. The conſequence is undeniable, in that Adjuncts are no part of the Eſſence, much leſs the Form, or the whole Eſſence; and therefore cannot denominate, (but equivocally) inſtead of the Eſſence.

If Circumciſion were the Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, even a Juſtifying Faith already in being; then ſo is Baptiſm; but the former is certain, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11, 12. <hi>He received the ſign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Faith, which he had yet being uncircumciſed: that he might be the Father of all them that believe, though they be not circumciſed, that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs might be imputed to them alſo.</hi> The laſt words confirm the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence alſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argu.</hi> 22. Many texts of Scripture ſhew that it was Juſtifying Faith that was by God required in the aged in baptiſm: which I will cite together, and not ſtand to fetch an argument from each alone. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38, 39. was before cited, verſe 41. It was they that gladly received the word that were Baptized. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.37. alſo, is before ſpoke to; <hi>It muſt be believing with all the heart. Mar.</hi> 16.15, 16. is very plain; firſt Chriſt commands them to preach the Goſpel: then he enacteth that on this preaching, <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> It is then a ſaving Faith. It is plain that Chriſt purpoſely putteth it before bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as its due place, even as that preaching to which Faith is here related is put before; and in that he gives us here the exact compendium of his new Law. And if it be not this ſaving Faith that goes before baptiſm, then Chriſt doth not ſo much as mention it. And to imagine that in this ſumme of his Covenant, he doth both leave wholly unmentioned that Faith which is the prerequiſite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Baptiſm, and alſo put in its place another Faith which is conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, this is to ſuppoſe Chriſt to clogg the moſt eſſential parts, and cleareſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiums of his Law, with ſuch inſuperable obſcurities that it cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. And ſay the like by all other Scripture, and you will make it more dark then the Papiſts accuſe it to be. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31, 32, 33. The Jaylor asks what he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55369:65"/>
ſhall do to be ſaved; <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers him, <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved and thy houſe</hi>; to which end, <hi>they ſpake to him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his houſe</hi>; and ſo, <hi>He was Baptized, believing in God with all his houſe.</hi> The Faith that <hi>Paul</hi> here commends to him, was a ſaving Faith expreſly: He that is ſaid to believe upon that command and inſtruction, is ſuppoſed to believe with the ſame faith that was ſo required of him, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47, 48. The Gentiles there were not only true Believers, but had the Holy-Ghoſt before baptiſm, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.15. The Lord opened <hi>Lydias</hi> heart (which ſeems to ſignifie a ſpecial operation of the Spirit) before ſhe was baptized. <hi>Act.</hi> 18.8. <hi>Criſpus and all his houſe believed on the Lord,</hi> which ſignifieth more then an Hiſtorical Faith. So <hi>Act.</hi> 19.4, 5. It was believing on Chriſt, and in his name, that was the Antecedent to their baptiſm. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go, Diſciple all Nations, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them</hi>; that Diſcipling which is here commanded, is in order to go before baptiſm: but it is making men ſincere Diſciples that is here commanded; therefore. It is preſuppoſed, what ever Diſcipling it be, that it is not the Event, but the Endeavor that is here made their dutie. And if it be only common Diſcipleſhip, then the Apoſtles and other Preachers of the Goſpel, are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to endeavor to make men true ſound Believers and Diſciples, till they had firſt baptized them, which is untrue. Moreover the Baptiſmal Faith, muſt be a Faith in Chriſts blood; for the application of the water ſignifieth the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Chriſts blood; and therefore their reception of the one, ſignifieth the other: But Faith in Chriſts blood, is Juſtifying Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26. <hi>The Righteouſneſs of God which is by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, is unto all and upon all them that believe; Rom.</hi> 3.22. It is therefore but equivocally called believing in Chriſt, as being but ſome part of that belief, which attaineth not this Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. How many times over and over, do Chriſt and his Apoſtles promiſe pardon and ſalvation to all that believe in Chriſt, without diſtinction of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving? whence it ſeems evident, that it is but improperly and equivocally called <hi>Believing in Chriſt,</hi> which is not Juſtifying and ſaying. See <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.15, 16, 18. and 11.25, 26. and 7.38. and 12.46, 44. and 5.24. and 6.35, 40, 47. and 14.12. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.1, 5, 10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.33. and 4.5. and 10.11. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48. Moreover, how eaſie is it to bring many Texts that prove that it was true ſaying Faith it ſelf that Chriſt and his Apoſtles preached to men, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to bring them to before baptiſm? Nay finde any one of them that ever did otherwiſe; whereas according to Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> Doctrine, they ſhould have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them to a Dogmatical Faith only before baptiſm (I mean, to be before performed) and a juſtifying Faith after. But I will adde no more of this.</p>

                        <hi>Argu.</hi> 23. The Church hath ever ſuppoſed baptized perſons to be ſaved; unleſs they afterward did violate that Covenant. Therefore they ſuppoſed them to have the condition of ſalvation, Faith and Repentance.</p>
                     <p>Hence thoſe high elogies of baptiſm in moſt of the Fathers, wherein they are now miſ-interpreted by many, as if they aſcribed it to the external ordinance, whereas they preſuppoſe, as the blood and Covenant of Chriſt, ſo the right qualifications of the partie baptized; upon which ſuppoſition (which we are bound to entertain of all that make a probable profeſſion) they did ſo predicate the glorious effects of Baptiſm, as well they might.</p>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55369:66"/>
(that I can finde) given us any deſcription of that Faith which entitles to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; and I verily think is not able to tell us what he would have himſelf to be taken for it. If it were a meer Dogmatical Faith, then thoſe ſhould be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized that were utterly unwilling, or at leaſt unwilling to take God for their God, or Chriſt for their Lord and Saviour, and the Holy-Ghoſt for their Sanctifier; and ſhould openly profeſs, <hi>I will not have this man reign over me, for I cannot yet ſpare the pleaſure of my ſin.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> mean that there is requiſite ſomewhat of the will and conſent, though not ſo much as to juſtifie; why did he not tell us what acts of the Will they be that are neceſſary?

I think by that time Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> hath but adventured to give us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act definition or deſcription of that Faith which he makes prerequiſite and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to baptiſm (which I hereby intreat him to do) he will have ſet us up ſo fair a mark to ſhoot at, that with a very little skill it may be ſmitten to the duſt.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Argu.</hi> 26. I will end as I begun, with humane teſtimony. 1. Our Divines againſt the Papiſts, do generally plead that hypocrites are not true members of the univerſal Church, but as a woodden leg is to the body. I am loth to turn over books and tranſcribe without need, but I ſhall ſoon do it, if it be denied. 2. Our Divines againſt the Arminians, do ſuppoſe the firſt act of believing to be the firſt time that God is as it were engaged to man in the Covenant of Grace; and that it is dangerous to make God to be in actual Covenant with men in the ſtate of nature, though the conditional covenant may be made to them, and though he have revealed his decree for the ſanctifying his elect: but he is ſuppoſed to diſpence his mercies to the unregenerate freely, as <hi>Dominus abſolutus,</hi> or as <hi>Rector ſupra leges,</hi> and not by giving them a Legal or Covenant-right. And indeed, in my opinion, the Tranſition is very eaſie from Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> opinion to Arminianiſm, if not unavoidable, ſave by a retreat, or by not ſeeing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the Conſequents to the Antecedent. For grant once that common Faith doth <hi>coram Deo</hi> give right to baptiſm, and it is very eaſie to prove that it gives right to the end of baptiſm, God having not inſtituted it to be an emptie ſign to thoſe that have true Right to it. And it will be no hard matter to prove that it is ſome ſpecial Grace that is the end of Baptiſm, at leſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin. And ſo upon the good uſe of common Grace, God ſhould be in Covenant obliged to give them ſpecial Grace: which is taken for Pelagianiſm.</p>

CHap. 15.</hi> So Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> Queſtioniſt qu. <hi>How do you make Faith and Repentance to be Conditions of the Covenant on our part, ſeeing the beſtowing of them is part of the condition on Gods part? Can they be our Conditions and Gods too?</hi> Anſwer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I ſhall not ſtand to diſtinguiſh of an Abſolute and Conditional Covenant, and ſo making the whole in the Abſolute Covenant to be Gods, and in the Conditional this part to be ours (which I know not whether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly underſtood, the Scripture will bear) but in plain term<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> deny that they are Gods Conditions, and affirm them to be ours. I know what God ſpeaks in his Word, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe works; that <hi>He will write his Law in our hearts, and put it into our inward parts; that he will take away the heart of ſtone, and give an heart of fleſh:</hi> which implyes this work of which we ſpeak. I know likewiſe what in particular is affirmed of Chriſt, that <hi>he is the Author and Finiſher of our Faith,</hi> &amp;c. Yet all this riſes not up higher to make them formally Gods acts, and not ours. Whoſe acts they be, his Conditions they are; this is evident. But they are our acts; we Believe and Repent; it is not God that Believes, it is not God that Repents, &amp;c. Faith and Repentance are mans works, not Gods works, which man in Covenant does, reſpective to ſalvation in the Covenant tendered. But the Apoſtle (ſome may ſay) in the next words tells us, <hi>That it is God that works the Will and the Deed.</hi> There he ſeems to take them from us, and aſcribes the formality of them to God. In this Cooperation of Gods, whether they be formally our works, or Gods, let <hi>Iſaiah</hi> determine, <hi>Iſa. 26.12. Thou haſt wrought all our works in us.</hi> When God hath wrought it, the work is ours; we have the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>R. B.</hi> MR <hi>Blakes</hi> buſineſs here, is to confute the anſwer that I gave to that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. A brief Reply may eaſily ſatisfie this confutation. 1. I did explain in what ſenſe theſe were called <hi>Covenants,</hi> ſhewing that that which is called the Abſolute Covenant, is in ſome reſpect no part of Gods Legiſlative Will, and ſo doth not <hi>jus conferre,</hi> but only part of his Decretive Will revealed: but that in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpects it belongs to the Legiſlative Will, and may be called an abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. And ſo the word <hi>Conditions</hi> applyed to God, is taken for <hi>the thing promiſed,</hi> improperly called a condition; but applied to us, it is ſtrictly taken: nor had I uſed the term <hi>Condition</hi> as to God, but as it was neceſſary to ſatisfie the Objector, who ſo called it, intimating the improprietie of it. Alſo I did plainly ſhew that the thing called Gods Condition, was not preciſely the ſame with that called ours: Ours was Believing and Repenting; Gods is the <hi>beſtowing of theſe,</hi> as the Queſtion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; or <hi>the giving us new and ſoft hearts, that we may do it our ſelves, and do it readily and willingly,</hi> &amp;c. as I expreſſed, <hi>pag.</hi> 46. becauſe I was not willing to meddle (affirmatively or negatively) with the queſtion of Gods immediate Phyſical Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of our own act; yet I doubt not but God doth truly, powerfully and effectually (to the removing or overcoming all reſiſtance) move the Soul to the act it ſelf; and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55369:67"/>
therefore it may truly be ſaid, that not only Gods own Action, but alſo our action of Believing, is the thing promiſed, (called his Condition by the Queriſt; and though improperly, yet in a language very common in Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> Treatiſe). This much being premiſed, I Reply more particularly. 1. I will yet ſay that God hath ſuch an abſolute Promiſe, as well as a Conditional, till you give me better Reaſons of your denyal, or your Queſtioning whether Scripture will bear it. And I ſhall yet ſay that the giving of our Faith and Repentance, is the matter of that abſolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. For your Argument to the contrarie, hath little in it, to compell me to a change. Your Maior is, <hi>Whoſe acts they are, his conditions they are</hi>; inſtead of proof, you ſay, <hi>This is evident.</hi> I Reply, 1. Negatively, it had been evident <hi>de Actione qua talis,</hi> that it is no ones Condition but his that performs it; as the condition is ſaid to be his that performeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not his that impoſeth it. But Affirmatively the propoſition holds not univerſally. Nor Negatively, ſpeaking <hi>de Actione qua eſt quid donandum.</hi> To your Minor, I could better anſwer if I could have found it. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it ſhould have been this, <hi>But our Faith and Repentance are not Gods acts.</hi> But I know not whether I may be ſo bold as ſay, you will own that. Before you ſay, <hi>This riſes not to make them formally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gods acts, and not ours:</hi> where 1. you cautelouſly ſpeak the two Propoſitions copulatively; and 2. you put in the word <hi>formally,</hi> which may do much to help you out. For the former, it is enough according to your own Rule to prove them Gods Conditions and ours, if they be Gods Actions and ours: for you ſay, <hi>Whoſe actions they are, his Conditions they are; that is evident.</hi> It is not therefore neceſſary that I prove them <hi>Gods and not ours.</hi> 2. It is hard to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your <hi>formally</hi> reſpect a natural or moral form. If the former action is the form it ſelf, it is harder to finde out its matter. Accidents have not properly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and form; but the ſubject is called its matter; but Action hath ſcarce ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per a ſubject as other Accidents have, ſeeing it is rather <hi>Agentis,</hi> then <hi>in agente inhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſivè</hi>: Of tranſients, its beyond doubt; and I think ſo of Immanents, unles we may with <hi>Scotus,</hi> take them for Qualities; If you ſpeak of Moral formality, were it ſinful Action, I ſhould deny God to be the Author; but of Faith and Repentance I dare not do ſo; I think God is the Author of them formally as well as material<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But in your following words you ſay, <hi>But they are our acts, &amp;c. God believes not, &amp;c.</hi> Reply; 1. To believe is our act; but to give us Faith, or to move us effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to Believe, as a ſuperior Cauſe, this is not our work, but Gods. 2. Let it be ſo; to believe is our work, and our condition; It follows not, that it is not Gods. 3. There are ſufficient reaſons why God is not ſaid to Believe, though he cauſe us to believe. If you go on the Predeterminants grounds, I ſuppoſe you know their reaſons, who take notice of the Armenians making this objection. If you enquire of the Jeſuits and Arminians, that go the way of determined concourſe, or of partial Cauſality, they think they have yet more to ſay, of which I ſuppoſe you not ignorant. <hi>Durandus</hi> his followers, think they have moſt of all to ſay, both why God ſhould be ſaid to believe, and why he is not the Author of our ſin, in that they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he cauſeth not the act immediately. And yet all theſe acknowledge God to be the cauſe of our acts.</p>
                     <p>But you adventure a ſtep further, and ſay, <hi>Faith and Repentance are mans works, not Gods Works.</hi> Reply; 1. What mean you then to yield afterward that <hi>God worketh all our works in us.</hi> (thoſe which he worketh are ſure his works) And that, <hi>It is God that worketh in us the Will and the Deed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. I never met with any orthodox Divine, but would yield that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faith is a work of Gods Spirit. And the Spirits work is doubtleſs Gods work.</p>

                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:55369:68"/>3. If you go the common way of the Predeterminants, you muſt acknowldge that God is the Phyſical, Efficient, Predetermining, Principal, Immediate cauſe of every act of every creature: and therefore doubtleſs of our Faith; and that both <hi>Immediatione Virtutis &amp; Suppoſiti,</hi> ſo that it is more properly his act then ours. For my part, I confeſs my ſelf of Biſhop <hi>Davenants</hi> minde who ſaith, (againſt <hi>Hoard</hi> p. 116) <hi>As for the predetermination of mens Wills, it is a Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie between the Dominicans and Jeſuites, with whoſe Metaphyſical ſpeculations our Proteſtant Divines love not to torture their brains</hi>; Or at le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t they ſhould not. I take it to be a point beyond the knowledge of any man, which way Gods works on the Will in theſe reſpects. Though if I muſt encline to any one way, it would be rather to <hi>Durandus</hi> (for ſtronger reaſons then I finde in <hi>Ludov. à Dola</hi> who yet hath more then I have ſeen well anſwered), and leſt of all to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinants, for all the numerous arguments of the Dominicans, and the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrength that Dr. <hi>Twiſſe, Heereb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ord, Rutherford,</hi> and others of our own, do adde to their cauſe. But yet I am far from denying our Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to be Gods Works; for I doubt not but he cauſeth them <hi>ut cauſa <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalis,</hi> by his general Providence, as they are natural Actions; and alſo by his ſpecial effectual Grace, <hi>contra omnem Reſiſtentiam,</hi> infallibly cauſeth them as they are the ſpecial gifts of the Spirit. So that I marvail that you ſhould ſay they are not Gods Works.</p>
                     <p>In the concluſion you adde, <hi>Our dexteritie in holy duties is from the frame into which Grace puts us: ſo ſtill the work is ours, though power for action is vouchſafed of God.</hi> Reply; Both <hi>Velle &amp; Perficere</hi> is the gift of God, and not only <hi>Poſſe Velle &amp; perficere.</hi> Why ſhould I trouble the Reader to ſay any more to that point, when Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> and others againſt the Remonſtrants have ſaid ſo much; and <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſo much before them all? And yet I never read a Remonſtrant that would ſay that the work is ſo ours, as that it is only the power that is vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed us by God. I conclude therefore that you have not confuted my anſwer; 1. In that you have not diſproved the abſolute Promiſe of the firſt ſpecial Grace. 2. You have not diſproved God to be the Author of our Faith, ſo as that it is his work. 3. If you had, yet Believing which is our work, is not the ſame thing with giving Faith, or moving us to believe, which I ſay is Gods Work.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Mr. Bl. I</hi> Finde no material difference in the Conditions on Gods part in theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants; Life is promiſed in both in Caſe of Covenant-keeping: and Death is threatned in both in caſe of Covenant-breaking. Some indeed have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to finde a great difference in the Life Promiſed in the Covenant of Works, and the Life that is promiſed in the Covenant of Grace; as alſo in the Death that is threatned in the one and in the other; and thereupon move many, and indeed inextricable difficulties, <hi>What Life man ſhould have enjoyed in caſe</hi> Adam <hi>had not fallen? and what Death man ſhould have dyed, in caſe Chriſt had not been promiſed?</hi> From which two, endleſsly more by way of Conſectary maybe drawn, by thoſe that want nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wit nor leiſure to debate them. In which the beſt way of ſatisfaction, and avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55369:68"/>
of ſuch puzzeling mazes, is to enquire what Scripture means by Life, which is the good in the Covenant promiſed, and what by Death, which is the evil threattned. Now for the firſt, Life contains all whatſoever conduces to true Happineſs, to make man bleſſed in Soul and body. All good that Chriſt purchaſes and Heaven enjoyes, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed under it in Goſpel expreſsions, &amp;c. On the contrary, under death is compriſed all that is injurious to man or mankinde, that tends to his miſery in Soul and body; The damnation of Hell, being called death (the uttermost of evils being the ſeparation of Soul and body from God, <hi>Joh. 8.51. 1 Joh. 3.14.</hi>) Sin which leads to it, and is the cauſe of it, is called death in like manner, <hi>Eph. 2.1.</hi> And the ſeparation of Soul from the body being called Death, ſickneſs, plagues, are ſo called in like manner, <hi>Exod. 10.17.</hi> Now happineſs being promiſed to man in Covenant, only indefinitely, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that notion of Life, without limit to this or that way of happineſs, in this or that place; God is ſtill at liberty, ſo that he make man happy, where or however to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue happineſs to him, and is not tyed up in his engagement either for earth or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And therefore, though learned <hi>Camero</hi> in his <hi>Tract. de triplici faedere. Theſ. 9.</hi> make this difference between the Covenant of works and the Covenant of Grace; <hi>In the Covenant of Works (which he calls nature) Life was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, and a moſt bleſſed Life, but an animal life in Paradiſe; in the Covenant of Grace, a life in Heaven and Spiritual.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his <hi>Aphor. of Juſtification,</hi> p. <hi>5.</hi> ſaith, <hi>That this Life promiſed was only the continuance of that ſtate that</hi> Adam <hi>was then in, in Paradiſe, is the opinion of moſt Divines;</hi> Yet with ſubmiſsion to better Judgements, I ſee not grounds for it: ſeeing Scripture no way determines the way and kinde, &amp;c. And indeed there are ſtrong probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Heaven being ſet out by the name of Paradiſe, in Chriſts ſpeech to the theif on the Croſs, and in <hi>Pauls</hi> viſion, &amp;c.</p>

Only, remember, that it is Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> alſo that hath theſe words, <hi>pag.</hi> 74. <hi>The Conditions on mans part in the Covenant of Works, were for mans preſervation</hi> in ſtatu. quo; <hi>in that condition in which he was created; to hold him in Communion with God, which was his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he expected not to be bettered by his obedience, either reſpective to happineſs (no more is promiſed then in preſent he had) nor yet in his Qualifications reſpective to his conformitie to God in Righteouſneſs and true holineſs. What improvement he might have made of the Habit infuſed, by the exerciſe of obedience, I ſhall not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; but no change in Qualifications was looked after or given in Promiſe</hi>; ſo far Mr. <hi>Blake.</hi>

                     <p>If the Reader cannot reconcile Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and me, let him reconcile Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> with himſelf, and the work is done.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But I confeſs that upon more ſerious conſideration of ſeveral paſſages in the New Teſtament, naming and deſcribing the work of Redemption, I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to think it far more probable that <hi>Adam</hi> was not created <hi>in Patria,</hi> but <hi>in Via</hi>; not in the higheſt perfection which he ſhould expect, but in the way to it. But whether God would have given it him in the ſame place that he was in, or in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55369:69"/>
ſome other (called Heaven) upon a remove, I take as Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> doth, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revealed, and undetermined in the Promiſe. So that I could finde in my heart to fall a confuting the ſame opinion in Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> expreſſed in theſe laſt words, which he confuteth in me; but that his former ſave me the labor.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I confeſs alſo that I ſpoke raſhly in ſaying that <hi>it was the opinion of moſt Divines</hi>; ſeeing it ſo hard a matter to know which way moſt go in the point. I alſo confeſs that the judgement of <hi>Camero,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> &amp;c. ſwayed much with me; but the ſilence of the text in <hi>Gen.</hi> much more: but I had not ſo well weighed ſeveral Texts in the New Teſtament, as I ought, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing Redemption, give ſome more light into the point. The ſame I ſay concerning the qualitie of the Death threatned.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. I agree to Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> firſt concluſion, that the thing is indeterminate; or at leſt, hard for us to know; but I cannot reconcile his premiſes with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; much leſs with this his latter ſpeech <hi>p.</hi> 74. For if (as he ſaies) the Life promiſed was <hi>all whatſoever conduces to true happineſs, to make men bleſſed in ſoul and body</hi>; (by <hi>conducing to,</hi> I ſuppoſe he meant <hi>conſtituting of</hi>) then either the Caeleſtial Degree of Grace and Glory <hi>conduces not</hi> to that happineſs (and then not to ours, who have no greater natural capacitie); or elſe I ſee not how it can be ſaid that this greater bleſſedneſs was not Promiſed. Doubtleſs <hi>Adam</hi> had not in preſent poſſeſſion ſo great a meaſure of holineſs, ſo confirmed a ſtate of Holineſs or Glory, nor ſo great and full a fruition of God, as Chriſt hath given us a ſure hope of: in the Goſpel.

                        <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. WHat alſo I have anſwered to the former, may ſuffice to this for the main. 2. One would think that you intended directly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict me: but whether you do ſo indeed, I cannot well tell. I know nor what you mean by <hi>ſubſtance and kinde,</hi> Pain and Loſs have no ſubſtance, but a ſubject: I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doubted but that it is the Loſs of the ſame God, and Bleſſedneſs (formally conſidered) but I am yet very uncertain whether the Bleſſedneſs promiſed by Chriſt, be not far greater in Degree, then that to <hi>Adam,</hi> and conſequently whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Poena Damni</hi> threatned in the Goſpel be not far greater. Alſo I know as to the mediate Bleſſings, Relative, they are not the ſame: To be deprived by Unbelief, of Remiſſion, Reconciliation, Adoption, the everlaſting praiſing of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55369:69"/>
him, that Redeemed us by his blood, &amp;c. theſe are true puniſhments on unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that reject the mercies offered to them: but theſe were none of <hi>Adams</hi> puniſhments. That was a Negation only to him, that is a Privation to them.</p>
                     <p>I profeſs alſo that I ever took the pain of Senſe to be of the ſame nature, which was due to <hi>Adams</hi> Soul, and which is due to unbelievers. Only I then did and ſtill do doubt, whether any Scripture ſpeak of the everlaſting Torments of <hi>Adams</hi> body; or whether it were not only his Soul that ſhould eternally ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, his body being turned to duſt and ſo ſuffering the penaltie of loſs: Nay, whether the New Teſtament do not make Reſurrection the proper fruit of Chriſts death and Reſurrection? But of this I am not fully reſolved my ſelf, much leſs will I contend for it.</p>
                     <p>But I muſt needs ſay, that I took not a gradual difference in puniſhments to be inconſiderable. Nay I know that moral ſpecifications are grounded in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural gradual differences. And Rewards and Puniſhments being moral things formally, they may and oft muſt be ſaid to differ <hi>ſpecie,</hi> and not to be the ſame, when naturally they differ but in degree. Yea, whether in naturals themſelves, we may not ſometimes finde a ſpecification in meer degrees, is not ſo clear as raſhly to be denyed. There is but a gradual difference between the ſmalleſt prick with a pin, and to be thruſt throow with daggers in 20 places; yet I will not ſay that it is the ſame puniſhment.</p>

Chriſt was to deſtroy by death, him that had the power of death, that is the Devil: but it ſeems, that the Law gave him his power, at the Will and Sentence of the Iudge, for execution. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.26.54. Death is the laſt enemy to be overcome. <hi>O Death, where is thy ſling? O Grave, where is thy victory?</hi> This is no doubt, the death now in queſtion; It is the evils befallen mankinde in execution of the violated Law, that are called enemies. Though we dye, it ſeems, there was a neceſſitie of Chriſts dying to looſe the bonds of our Death, and procure us a Reſurrection. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. <hi>As by one mans offence death reigned by one, &amp;c.</hi> That one man muſt dye for the people, <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I do not believe you that any are Priviledged from death as the wages of ſin, who dye. This is the part of the penalty which the ſentence paſſed on the offendor himſelf, for all the promiſed ſatisfaction by a Redeemer: Nor did the Redeemer ſatisfie to that end, to prevent our death, or to cauſe that it ſhould not be the wages of ſin but to deliver us from under the power of it. Where you ſay, that this way of God <hi>with unbelievers is voluntary, not neceſsitated</hi>: I Reply; So it may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, becauſe it was meant in the threatning. It is dangerous to imagine that God is ever the leſs free, or more neceſſitated, ſo as that his actions ſhould be leſs voluntary, becauſe of his determinations. He doth as voluntarily do what he hath predetermined to do, and foretold he will do, as if he had done nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. God changeth not, and therefore he is as voluntary in the execution, as he was in the determination.</p>

If you will have a Syllogiſm of Gods making, why did you not tell us when or where you found it? and let us ſee as well as you, whence you had it, that we may know God made it.

But that muſt not be expected; for you ſay anon, that it is ſomething not written that is ſealed. Or do you mean that in the Inſtitution, God gives you the materials, and you form it your ſelves? If ſo, why blamed you mine, which is of mans forming, but yet as you ſuppoſe, the materials ſo far of God, that the concluſion is <hi>de fide.</hi> To give you the materials of a Syllogiſm, is not to give you a Syllogiſm; for the form <hi>denominates.</hi> I muſt therefore ſuppoſe a Believer yet to be upon the frame of one (as you ſpeak).

I know not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the firſt word, (but I will not ſtand on that, as being I know but a verbal ſlip) I do not apprehend what uſe there can be for this Syllogiſm in this buſineſs. 1. It is ſuppoſed that every Chriſtian knows that Chriſt and Remiſſion are given together; and when they know it, what uſe for ſyllogizing towards the explication of the uſe of that Seal? 2. Nay doth not your arguing intimate that the believer is more aſſured that Chriſt is given to him, then that pardon is given him? Or elſe if the former were not <hi>quid notius,</hi> how could it be a fit <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>? you ſuppoſe his doubt to be of pardon and ſalvation, and the former brought to prove that, whereas I think, few doubt of one, but they doubt of the other: and I think the Sacrament ſealeth the gift of Chriſt, as well as of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as you confeſs.

But I am not of their minde. Yet I think it is a Metaphore; and to make it the ſubject of tedious diſputations, and lay too great ſtreſs upon a Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal notion, is the way not to edifie, but to loſe our ſelves.

The common end is to ſignifie by a ſpecial ſign our owning of that writing or Inſtrument to which it is annexed. 2. The ſpecial end is according to the nature and uſe of the Inſtruments <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Some Inſtruments directed to a Communitie, or indefinitly to any whom it may concern. 2. Some to particular perſons, or ſome few Individuals. Both of them are, 1. ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Narratives de re.</hi> 2. Or obligatory Conſtitutions or acknowledgments <hi>de Debito.</hi> The former are either 1. Doctrinal, and ſo a man may give it under his hand and ſeal that he owns ſuch or ſuch a Doctrine, or confeſſion of Faith, or form preſcribed by him as Teacher to his Schollers or Hearers, &amp;c. 2. Or Hiſtorical; and ſo a man may give it under his hand and Seal, that ſuch a perſon is thus or thus qualified; or did this or that act, or ſuffered loſſes, pain, &amp;c. 2. The Conſtitutions <hi>de Debito,</hi> are 1. <hi>De Debito officii,</hi> the Conſtitution of Dutie. 1. By equals upon voluntary obligation by contract (which concerneth not our buſineſs). 2. By Superiors to their Subjects or Inferiors, which is either a Law to any or to ſome Communitie: Or elſe a Precept to ſome particulars. And ſo Soveraigns may give out Laws, and Proclamations under their hand and Seal? and Juſtices and Inferior Magiſtrates may ſeal their Precepts and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and Orders, &amp;c. 2. Or they are <hi>de Debito Beneficii</hi>; Conſtituted 1. by a Legiſlator or Rector as ſuch, 2. by a Proprietary or Owner or Lord, as ſuch. 1. The former is either Abſolute, as the Collation of ſome honors may be, and ſome acts of pardon, and the Diviſions of Inheritances, as among the Iſraelites at their firſt poſſeſſing <hi>Canaan</hi>: Or they are Conditional; And the Condition is either pure Acceptance (which is ſo naturally requiſite, that it is uſually ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and not expreſſed, and ſuch Collations go commonly under the name of Abſolute and Pure Donations, though indeed they are not). Or elſe ſome requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ſervice or moral action, which may properly make the Benefit to be <hi>Praemium,</hi>
                        <pb n="119" facs="tcp:55369:72"/>
a Reward. All theſe being ſealed, the Seal doth oblige the Benefactor or Donor, becauſe the Inſtrument is obligatory, if it be for future conveyance. If a preſent Collation, then the Seal doth confirm the Receivers Right, againſt any that may hereafter queſtion it. The like may be ſaid of Acknowledgments, as of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions: The Subject may acknowledge his ſubjection and Seal it; the Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulator may cauſe the Promiſor to acknowledge Duty or Debt, and to Seal it: So for Acknowledgments of Debts diſcharged, Rewards received, Conditions performed, &amp;c. 3. The like may be ſaid <hi>de Debito Panae,</hi> when Penal Laws are ſealed: and of Commiſſions and Warrants for execution; but this leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns our caſe.</p>
                     <p>So that the uſe of a Seal as ſuch, is but to teſtifie in a ſpecial manner that the Thing or Inſtrument is really ours, or that we own it: and ſo as <hi>Ameſius</hi> ſaith, to be <hi>Teſtimonium Secundarium,</hi> added to the Primary Teſtimonie of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or other Inſtrument. But the ſpecial end of the Seal ariſeth from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and uſe of the Inſtrument ſealed, and not from the nature of a Seal as ſuch.</p>
                     <p>My opinion now upon the preſent Controverſie, I give you in theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</p>
                     <p>Concl. 1. Taking the word as ſtrictly as we uſe to do in Engliſh, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not properly Seals, but Metaphorically. But taking the word <hi>Seal</hi> more largely, as it ſignifieth any inſtituted ſign for teſtimony of ones owning the Inſtrument, Revealing, Promiſing, Exhibiting, &amp;c. ſo they may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Seals.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Sacraments are not to be applyed to univerſal or indefinite ſubjects, but to particulars: Indeed they cannot be entire Sacraments, without particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Application; that is, either to that particular Congregation, or a particular perſon: and ſtill the Receptive Application muſt be perſonal.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. Yet I conceive that as the Univerſal Enunciation is firſt to be expreſſed, ſo it is that univerſal that is ſealed, though with application to ſingular perſons; it being not a Collective, but a Diſtributive Univerſal; and not Diſtributive only in <hi>Genera ſingulorum,</hi> but in <hi>ſingula Generum</hi>: and therefore may be applyed <hi>ad ſingula Generum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. I conceive that God may be ſaid to Seal firſt the truth of the Hiſtory of Chriſts death and blood ſhed: and alſo the Truth of the Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, that this Blood was ſhed as a Ranſom for ſinners, and that it was for our ſins that he dyed.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And this <hi>quoad inſtitutionem Sacramentorum,</hi> may be ſaid to be intended to his univerſal Church; but <hi>quoad exercitium, &amp; actual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="7">7. I conceive alſo that in the Miniſterial act of offering, and ſaying, Take, Eat, Drink, Chriſt may be ſaid to Seal his Precept, whereby he hath made it the dutie of man, to Take or Accept an offered Saviour with his benefits, on the Offerers terms.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Thus far there is no queſtion but he ſealeth to Hypocrites, as well as to true Believers.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Concerning the Promiſe or Teſtament, we muſt yet diſtinctly conſider, 1. the Promiſe it ſelf which goes firſt. 2. the ſealing of this Promiſe, which is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:55369:73"/>
next. 3. the Delivery or Application by offer which is next. 4. the Reception or Acceptance of the thing offered, which is next. 5. the actual efficacie of the Promiſe in Conſtituting the Right of the Receiver in the Benefit, which is next. 6. the mutual obligation of each Partie to fulfill the remainder of the Covenant for the future, which is the laſt.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. That Seal which properly confirms the Goſpel to be true, is miracles and other gifts of the Holy Ghoſt; but the Sacraments, though they may do much alſo to that, as they are a continued publick Commemoration, and ſo an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way of Tradition, yet are they eſpecially Applicatory ſigns for renewing clear apprehenſions, helping memorie, aſſiſting in our Application of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Promiſe, reſolving our Wills<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> exciting our affections to a more lively ſenſe of Chriſts Love, and our ſin and Duty, &amp;c. and actually to help us in the Praiſes of the Redeemer by ſo ſolemn and ſenſible a Commemoration of his Redemption of us.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Miniſters are Chriſts Officers in Explication and Application of his Laws and Covenants.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Their Application or Explication is no Addition to the ſenſe, nor any making of a new Law or Covenant. Therefore when God ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever will Believe, ſhall have Chriſt and Life</hi>; and the Miniſter ſaith, <hi>If thou</hi> A. B. <hi>wilt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, thou ſhalt have Chriſt and Life</hi>; The Miniſter addeth not to the Promiſe, but applyeth it according to its proper ſenſe; ſeeing a univerſal Enunciation ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ſo called, may be diſtributed <hi>in ſingula generum,</hi> though a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal <hi>ſecundum quid</hi> may be only diſtributed into <hi>Species</hi> or <hi>genera ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. And therefore to ſeal to that ſingular Enunciation, is no more then to ſeal to the Univerſal, but much leſs, if it were to that alone.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. It is Gods Legal Deed of Gift, or Promiſe written in Scripture, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe expreſſed, to which the Sacrament is a Seal, and conſequently to that ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar enunciation, which is but part of the ſame Promiſe, and that as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the univerſal: but not as it is a thing diſtinct from the univerſal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or as ſuppoſed to adde to it, or contain more, for ſenſe, in it; nor to the Application of the Miniſter, as ſuch.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. But for the right underſtanding of this, we muſt explain this word, <hi>to Seal to,</hi> which is of ſeveral ſignifications: 1. It is one thing to <hi>ſeal to</hi> a thing as the <hi>Teſtimonium primarium,</hi> to which the Seal is the <hi>Teſtimonium ſecundarium.</hi> So the Inſtrument is <hi>ſealed to.</hi> 2. It is another thing to <hi>ſeal to</hi> a thing as the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectum materiale obſignatum:</hi> ſo the matter contained in that Inſtrument is <hi>ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to.</hi> 3. It is another thing to <hi>ſeal to</hi> a thing as the <hi>finis cujus ultimatus:</hi> ſo the good which the partie ultimately receives from that Donation, Contract, &amp;c. as its end, is <hi>ſealed to.</hi> 4. And its another thing to <hi>ſeal to</hi> a thing as the <hi>finis cujus proximus, vel propior:</hi> and ſo to our Right to Chriſt, our Remiſſion, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Adoption, &amp;c. are <hi>ſealed to.</hi> 5. And its yet another thing to <hi>ſeal to</hi> a perſon as the <hi>finis cui</hi>: and ſo God <hi>ſealeth to</hi> us, the forementioned Covenant, &amp;c. I mean that according to its ſeveral reſpects to theſe things; the words <hi>ſeal to</hi> hath ſeveral ſignifications. Now the application, the Right delivered, &amp;c. may be ſaid to be <hi>ſealed to,</hi> as the <hi>finis proximus cujus:</hi> for it is ſealed that it may be delivered and applyed for conveying Right: but theſe are not ſealed to as the <hi>ſubjectum obſignatum</hi>: that is the Promiſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Grant it ſelf, whereby Right is conveyed.</p>
                     <p n="16">
                        <pb n="121" facs="tcp:55369:73"/>16. The Sacraments are not only Seals to the Grant or Promiſe, but further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more are Exhibiting or Conferring ſigns, in ſubſerviencie to the Promiſe; as Inſtruments to ſolemnize the Collation of Chriſt and his Benefits. And this ſeems to be a far more remarkable end of them, then proper ſealing: For Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are ſuch kind of ſigns, as thoſe in the ſolemnization of marriage, in giving hands, putting on a ring, expreſſing Conſent, &amp;c. Or as the Crowning of a King, or the liſting a Souldier: or as a twig, a turf, or a Key in giving poſſeſſion. So that the main uſe followeth the meer ſealing.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. As Gods Univerſal Grant of Chriſt and pardon is but Conditional (in form or ſenſe) to which the Sacrament ſealeth; ſo the miniſter that diſtributeth the Univerſal to ſingulars, muſt do it but Conditionally, <hi>If thou</hi> A. B. <hi>wilt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, thou ſhalt have Chriſt and Life:</hi> So that ſtill it is no Abſolute but a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Promiſe or Grant that is ſealed.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. This Conditional Promiſe is ſealed Abſolutely and actually; for were it ſealed only Conditionally, then it were not Actually ſealed at all, till the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is fulfilled: but the ſenſe would run thus, <hi>This Action ſhall be my Seal, when you believe, or perform ſome other Condition.</hi> But I conceive God ſealeth Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and therefore Abſolutely, before men truly or really believe, when a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter on his Command and by his Commiſſion doth it.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Yet though God Seal the Conditional Promiſe Abſolutely to ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to receive it; that is, though he hereby atteſt that he owns that Promiſe as his Act or Deed; yet doth he not either Exhibite or Convey Right to Chriſt and his Benefits, nor yet oblige himſelf for the future, Abſolutely, but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally only. For in this Conveyance and Obligation the Grant or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is the principal Inſtrument, and the ſign the leſs principal; and both to the ſame uſe: and therefore the latter cannot Abſolutely Convey, or Oblige the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſer, unleſs the firſt do it abſolutely too.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. God may therefore ſeal his Promiſe, and thereupon offer Chriſt and Life to men that pretended a willingneſs to Receive it, and yet not actually convey Right to Chriſt and Life, nor Actually oblige himſelf to pardon or ſave the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, becauſe the partie may refuſe the offer, either refuſing Sacrament and all, or only Refuſing in heart the benefit offered, at leſt as ſuch and on the terms that its offered on, and on which only it may be had. And ſo when the ſealing uſe is paſt, the Sacrament may loſe its Conveying and obliging force (ſo far as we may ſay God obligeth himſelf) for want of true Reception: and thus it doth with all unſound Believers.</p>
                     <p>I deſire the Reader, according to this explanation to underſtand that which I wrote againſt Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> in my book of Baptiſm, about the Sacraments ſealing to the ungodly.</p>
                     <p>Having ſaid thus much for the opening of my opinion, and the avoiding of Confuſion, I return to Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> words. And 1. where he ſaith, <hi>The maior is not ſealed; for the Sacraments ſeal not to the truth of any general propoſitions, but they ſeal with application to particular perſons</hi>: I Reply, They ſeal no doubt with reſpect to particular perſons; but that they may not ſeal both the general Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and the ſingular as comprized in it, to that particular perſon, I hear not yet proved, <hi>viz. q. d. Having promiſed Chriſt and Life to every one that will Accept him, leſt thou ſhouldſt ſtagger at this my Promiſe, I own it by this ſeal.</hi> 2. Where he ſaith, <hi>It ſeals that which ſupplies the place of the minor</hi>; viz. <hi>I give thee Chriſt:</hi> I Reply, 1. Its true; becauſe this is no addition to the general Grant, but part
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55369:74"/>
of its proper ſenſe: For he that ſaith, <hi>I give it to all Believers,</hi> ſaith in ſenſe, <hi>I give it to thee if thou be a Believer.</hi> Otherwiſe God ſealeth not to what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth not: and were not the ſingular Enunciation comprehended in the ſenſe of the Univerſal, you could never prove that the ſingular is ſealed. 2. But what is the meaning of your Minor, which you ſay is ſealed? Is it an Abſolute and ſimple Propoſition or Enunciation, as you expreſs it? Or is it a Conditional one? Do you mean, <hi>I will give thee Chriſt on Condition that thou Accept him as offered</hi>: or, <hi>I will give him Abſolutely</hi>: And by <hi>giving,</hi> do you mean proper effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual giving which conveys Right? or only an offer which conveys not Right till it be Accepted on the terms on which its offered? If you mean by gift, a meer offer, then it may be ſealed Abſolutely; for God doth Abſolutely offer, where he doth but Conditionally Give. He doth not ſay, <hi>I will offer you Chriſt, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition you will take him</hi>; for he offereth him whether men Accept him or not. If you mean a full gift, and mean the Enunciation to be Abſolute, then that man ſhall certainly have Chriſt and Life, whether he accept him or not; or at leſt, accepting is no Condition. And then all that God ſo ſealeth to, ſhall be ſaved. Nor will it help you to ſay, that he ſeals this Abſolute Promiſe but Conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for however, rhe man muſt needs be ſaved by ſuch a Gift or Promiſe it ſelf, though it were never ſealed at all. If you mean (as I ſuppoſe you do) <hi>I give thee Chriſt to be thine, on condition that thou Accept him as offered</hi>; then 1. Why did you expreſs a Conditional Gift, in Abſolute terms, leaving out the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? 2. Why then are you ſo loth to yield that this Conditional Grant is Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ſealed, that is, owned by an expreſs ſign; As long as the Grant is but Conditional, yea and the ſign it ſelf doth Exhibit or Convey but Conditional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what danger to ſay that it ſealeth Abſolutely? Is there not more inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience in ſaying that both the Grant is Conditional, and yet alſo that it is but Conditionally ſealed?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. You adde, <hi>The outward Elements are given on this Condition, that we receive them, that we eat and drink them:</hi> Reply, I never gave them but on a higher Condition, <hi>viz. If you will take Chriſt offered, take this which ſignifieth, &amp;c.</hi> And I think Chriſt never gave them but on condition, that men Accept him as well as the ſign; though when they performed not what they pretend to do, he doth not ſuſpend his act of Tradition: And in ſuch a caſe it is a Delivering, but not a proper Giving. And I do not think that you uſe your ſelves to give the Sacramental ſigns meerly on condition that men will Take, and Eat, and Drink them: As you charge a further Condition on them, ſo I conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture that if they ſhould profeſs no more, then ſo to Take the ſigns, you would not deliver them.</p>
                     <p>Next you argue thus, <hi>That which all do not partake of that receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not Abſolutely, but Conditionally ſealed in the Sacrament. But all do not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of Chriſt in the Sacrament; therefore he is not Abſolutely, but Conditionally ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> Reply, 1. What if I ſhould grant all this? what is it to our preſent que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion? to <hi>Seal Chriſt,</hi> is ſomewhat an uncouth phraſe. It is either the Grant or Promiſe of Chriſt that you mean, which Gives Chriſt: or it is the <hi>Jus</hi> ſo Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: (For Chriſt himſelf in ſubſtance is not Given by the Covenant, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by giving us Right to him.) If you mean it of Right to Chriſt, then this is the <hi>Terminus proximus exhibitionis,</hi> and the more remote end of ſealing; whereas our Queſtion was of the ſubject ſealed, and not of the end of ſealing. And therefore you ſhould not have thought that you conclude the Queſtion,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55369:74"/>
when you ſpeak only to another queſtion. But if by <hi>ſealing Chriſt,</hi> you mean on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſealing the Promiſe or Grant of Chriſt and Life in him</hi>; then 2. I deny your major propoſition. If you had ſaid only, <hi>That which all do not partake of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament, is not abſolutely Given</hi>; I ſhould eaſily have granted it: for it is Given on condition of Receiving: and even a ſealed Grant may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual to Conveyance, through the interpoſition of the Diſſent and Rejection of him that ſhould receive. But you adde for the confirmation of the major, <hi>None can miſs of that which God Abſolutely Granteth, and Abſolutely ſealeth</hi>; Reply, 1. But what is this to your major? was there any mention of <hi>Abſolute Granting</hi>? This is ſomewhat a large Addition. 2. And what is this to the queſtion between you and me? You know and acknowledge, that I ſay, It is the Conditional Grant that is Abſolutely ſealed: why then do you diſpute againſt Abſolute Granting and Sealing? This is loſs of time to the beſt of your Readers; and for the worſt, it may make them think my opinion is clean contrary to my own profeſſion.</p>

                        <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. TO your Argument there needs no more to be ſaid then is ſaid to the former. When God hath in one Deed of Gift beſtowed on us Chriſt and Life, Remiſſion, Juſtification, Adoption, &amp;c. (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10, 11, 12. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.11, 12.) it muſt be in caſe of great ignorance that the perſon that knows that God giveth him Chriſt, muſt yet be conſtrained by after arguings to acknowledge that he giveth him Juſtification. And how this argument tends to explain the nature of Sacramental ſealing, I neither know, nor ſee any thing here to help me to know. If you will ſuppoſe ſuch an Argument as this uſed for Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, I would not ſtick to yield it uſeful; <hi>What God doth by his Testament give to all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on condition they will Accept it, that he gives to me on condition I will Accept it. But he gives Chriſt and Life in him, to all men if they will Accept it; therefore to me: (Or if you will ſay, to all that hear the Goſpel.)</hi> Though the uſe of ſuch an Argument is more for lively Application, then confirmation of the Truth of the Grant.</p>

                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:55369:75"/>2. Your ſuppoſition that your minor is ſealed, and not your major, hath enough ſaid to it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Sacraments may confirme your faith in Chriſt as given to you, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by ſealing, <hi>viz.</hi> as they are ſigns for Remembrance, Excitation to ſenſe and lively apprehenſions of Gods Donation, and as they are ſigns inſtrumental in ſole Conveyance of the benefit Given, as a twig and a turfe, and a Key in giving poſſeſſion, and the words and actions of matrimonial ſolemnization or Contract.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is new Logick to my underſtanding, that <hi>the minor being ſealed, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion</hi> eo nomine <hi>is ſealed</hi>: The minor of many an Argument may be true, and the concluſion falſe. And therefore when the caſe ſo falls out, that both minor and concluſion are true, or ſealed, it is not <hi>eo nomine,</hi> becauſe the minor is true, that the Concluſion is ſo, (or is ſealed, <hi>eo nomine</hi> becauſe the minor is ſo) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both major and minor are ſo, and not then neither, but upon ſuppoſition that the Syllogiſm be ſound.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But to prove this, you ſay, <hi>the proof of any Propoſition in a Syllogiſm, is in order to the proof of the Concluſion: and ſo the ſealing of any Propoſition is in order to the ſealing of the Concluſion:</hi> Reply; The firſt is true. 1. But what is this to the matter? Is it all one to <hi>prove it</hi> and to <hi>be in order to prove it,</hi> to <hi>ſeal it</hi> and to <hi>be in order to the ſealing of it</hi>? Is the Concluſion proved on the proof of one Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition? No: therefore according to your own arguing, neither is it ſealed by the ſealing of one Propoſition. 2. That the ſealing of one Propoſition is in order to the ſealing of the Concluſion, I deny. 1. It may be a ſingle Propoſition that is ſealed, not ſtanding as part of a Syllogiſm: as this, <hi>I Give Chriſt and Life in him to you all that will Accept him.</hi> 2. If it be ſuppoſed part of a Syllogiſm, it is enough ſometime that the Concluſion be cleared or confirmed, or we enabled ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly to gather it, by the ſealing of one Propoſition: but it is not neceſſary that it be the very ſealing of the Concluſion, to which the ſealing of that Ptopoſition doth tend. When a Landlord hath ſealed a Leaſe to his Tenant, he hath ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Propoſition, <hi>If</hi> A. B. <hi>well and truly pay ſuch Rents, he ſhall quietly enjoy ſuch Lands:</hi> ſuppoſe the minor to be, <hi>But</hi> A. B. <hi>doth or will well and truly pay ſuch Rents</hi>: ſuppoſe this minor Propoſition either falſe or uncertain, will you ſay then that the ſealing of the major was in order to the ſealing of the Concluſion? No: the Concluſion is Abſolute, <hi>therefore</hi> A. B. <hi>ſhall enjoy ſuch Lands:</hi> but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſealed is Conditional. It is enough that it ſecure his Right, if he pay his Rent, and that it enable him infallibly ſo to conclude, while he performs the conditions, though it tend not at all to ſeal the Concluſion. We ſeldom uſe ſeals to Syllogiſms: and not to Concluſions as ſuch, or <hi>eo noimne,</hi> becauſe a major or minor Propoſition is proved: though the thing ſealed may be to other uſes made part of a Syllogiſm.</p>
                     <p>Yet I grant that where the Syllogiſm is ſuch as that one of the Propoſitions doth morally contain the Concluſion in ſenſe, though not in terms, there the concluſion is ſealed when that one Propoſition is ſealed: becauſe it is the ſenſe and not meer terms that are ſealed; and undoubted naturals are preſuppoſed in moralitie, and therefore the ſealing of one is the ſealing of both: For example, if you argue either from a Synonimal term, or from the thing as Defined to the thing as named, or from the <hi>Genus</hi> to the <hi>Species,</hi> or from the Species to the Individual; thus, <hi>ſuccinum corroborat cerebrum: At Ambarum, vel electrum eſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinum:</hi> therefore <hi>Ambarum vel electrum corroborat cerebrum:</hi> or thus, <hi>Privatio
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55369:75"/>
viſus eſt naturae malum. Caecitas eſt Privatio viſus:</hi> therefore, <hi>Caecitas eſt naturae malum.</hi> Or thus, <hi>God made every creature: Man is a creature: therefore God made man.</hi> Or thus, <hi>All men on earth are ſinners. I am a man on earth: therefore I am a ſinner.</hi> In all theſe, if you ſeal the major propoſition, or affirm it true, you do indeed, though not in terms, affirm or ſeal the concluſion morally. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion that you ſay I make, reacheth no higher. But obſerve that its only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally that I ſay you may be ſaid to ſay or ſeal the concluſion; becauſe unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable naturals are preſuppoſed in Morals and Legals.</p>

But take it in what ſenſe you will in any propriety, and I deny that it is Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally written in Scripture, that you or I do Believe, or yet that you or I are Juſtified and ſhall be ſaved. Yet I confeſs that ſome Concluſions may be ſaid to be <hi>Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè vel ſecundum loquutionem moralem</hi> in Scripture, when but one of the premiſes is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55369:76"/>
there: but that is when the other is preſuppoſed as being as certain: but of this more anon, where you ſpeak of this ſubject more largely.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To your inſtance, I ſay, It is by Faith and natural knowledg mixt that you conclude you ſhall riſe again. The Concluſion participateth of both Premiſes, as to the ground of its certainty. That it doth <hi>ſequi,</hi> is a right gathered Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, is known only by Reaſon, and not by Faith: that it is true, is known partly by Reaſon, and partly by Faith, when the Premiſes belong to both. Yet though in ſtrict ſenſe, it be thus mixt, in our ordinary diſcourſe we muſt deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate it from one of the Premiſes, and uſually from the more notable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies from the more Debile. Scripture ſaith, <hi>All men ſhall riſe</hi>; Reaſon ſaith, you are a man. Though the Concluſion here par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>e of both, yet it is moſt fitly ſaid to be <hi>de fide,</hi> both becauſe Scripture intended each particular man in the Univerſal; and becauſe it is ſuppoſed as known to all, that they are men; and therefore the other part is it that reſolveth the doubt, and is the notable and more debile part.</p>
                     <p>Its I know undoubted with you, that <hi>Concluſio ſequitur partem debiliorem.</hi> Now though Gods Word in it ſelf is moſt infallible, yet in reſpect of the evidence to us, it is generally acknowledged that it is far ſhort of natural principles, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of ſenſe, in ſo much that men have taken it for granted, that the objects of faith are not evident (of which I will not now ſtand to ſpeak what I think, but touch it anon). Therefore it being more evident that you are a man, then it is that all men ſhall riſe, it is fitteſt to ſay the Concluſion is <hi>de fide</hi> as the more debile part. But can we ſay ſo of the preſent Concluſion in queſtion? Have you a fuller evidence that you are a ſincere Believer, then you have that, All ſincere Believers are Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? I have not for my part: But it ſeems by your following words that you have, or ſuppoſe others to have; to which I ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. If you have as evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that Faith is in your heart, (ſaving Faith) as that Reaſon is in your Soul, &amp; know your ſelf to be a Believer as evidently as you know your ſelf to be a man, then your Concluſion may be denominated to be <hi>de fide,</hi> as a <hi>parte delibiore.</hi> But if this be not your caſe, it is moſt fit (for all the mixt intereſt of the Premiſes) to ſay that it is not <hi>de fide,</hi> but from the knowledge of your ſincerity in the Faith, as a <hi>parte debiliore.</hi> And if it be your caſe indeed, you are the happieſt man that ever I yet ſpake with. But I know that no man ordinarily can have ſuch evidence of his ſincerity; yet becauſe I will not ſpeak of you or others by my ſelf, nor judge others hearts to be as bad as my own, or as all thoſe that I have converſed with, we will if you pleaſe thus comprimize the difference: All thoſe whoſe evidence of ſinceritie is as cleer as the evidence of their Reaſon and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, yea or more then Scripture evidence, ſo that Gods Teſtimony is <hi>pars de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilior</hi> in the Syllogiſm; theſe ſhall take the Concluſion, <hi>that they are Juſtified,</hi> to be <hi>de fide</hi>: and all the reſt ſhall take the Concluſion to be not <hi>de fide,</hi> but from the knowledge of themſelves: and then let the iſſue ſhew whether more will be of your mind or of mine.

                     <p n="5">5. And as hardly can I diſcern aſſurance of our ſinceritie, in the deſcription of Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. Unleſs you mean that hope is part of Faith, and aſſurance the ſame with hope; both which need more proof. Hope may be without aſſurance: and when it is joyned with it, yet it is not the ſame thing. Only ſuch aſſurance is a ſingular help to the exerciſe of Hope.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Its true that Faith may be ſaid, as you ſpeak, to Realize ſalvation to the Soul; that is, when the Soul doubteth whether there be indeed ſuch a Glory
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55369:78"/>
and Salvation to be expected and enjoyed by Believers, as Chriſt hath promiſed, here Faith apprehendeth it as Real or Certain, and ſo reſolves the doubt. But when the doubt is only whether I be a true Believer, Faith reſolves it not: and when the doubt is, whether this certain Glory and Salvation ſhall be mine, Faith only cooperateth to the reſolve of it, by affording us one of the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but not both, and not wholly the Concluſion.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. I am of Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> minde that it is one of Faiths moſt eminent acts, by which it is there deſcribed: But ſo think not they that tell us that is none of the Inſtrumental Juſtifying act which is there deſcribed.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. This which you took to be a good anſwer, is that great miſtake which hath ſo hardned the Papiſts againſt us; and were it not for this point, I ſhould not have deſired much to have ſaid any thing to you of the reſt, (about Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſealing) as being confident that we mean the ſame thing in the main.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. You forſake them that uſe to give this anſwer, when you confine it to thoſe only that <hi>with aſſured grounds and infallible demonſtrations can make it good to themſelves that they Believe, i. e.</hi> ſavingly.

                     <p n="3">3. I have anſwered this ſufficiently, in telling you my opinion: <hi>i. e.</hi> The Concluſion ſtill partakes of the nature of both Premiſes: and therefore when one is <hi>de fide,</hi> and the other <hi>naturaliter revelatum vel cognitum,</hi> there the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, is not purely either ſupernatural or natural, <hi>de fide,</hi> or <hi>ex cognitione natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali</hi>; but mixt of both.

But becauſe it is fitteſt in our common ſpeech to give this Concluſion a ſimple and not a compound Denomination (for brevitie ſake) therefore we may well denominate it from one of the Propoſitions, and that muſt alwaies be <hi>a parte debiliore</hi>: And therefore when it is <hi>principia naturaliter nota</hi> that make one propoſition or ſenſible things, or what ever that is more evident then the truth of the Propoſition which is of Divine Teſtimony, there it is fitteſt to ſay, The Concluſion is <hi>de fide,</hi> or of ſupernatural Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; As when the one Propoſition is that <hi>there is a God,</hi> or <hi>I am a man,</hi> or <hi>God is Great, or Good, or True.</hi> But when the other Propoſition is leſs evident then that which is of Divine Revelation, then it is fitteſt to ſay, that the Concluſion is ſuch as that Propoſition is, and not properly <hi>de fide.</hi> For the Concluſion being the joynt iſſue of both Premiſes as its parents or true Cauſes, it cannot be more noble then the more ignoble of them. This explication of my opinion is it that I referr you to as the ſubſtance of my anſwer to all that follows.</p>

If it be evident that <hi>Deus eſt Verax, &amp; Deus haec teſtatur,</hi> that God is true of his Word, and that this is his Word or Revelation, then Faith hath evident principles. But the Antecedent is true; therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Into theſe principles we reſolve all points of Faith: Whatſoever God witneſſeth is true; but the Doctrine of the Reſurrection, judgment, &amp;c. God witneſſeth or revealeth; therefore; That God is true, we have the ſame Evidence as that he is perfectly good, and that is, that he is God: and that there is a God, I take to be as evident a Truth as any in Nature to Reaſon, though God himſelf be ſo far above our comprehenſion. That this is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, hath alſo its evidence, in evident miracles ſealing it to the firſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; and in Evidently Infallible Tradition delivering down to us the Records with the ſeals. I doubt not to affirm that ſome humane Teſtimony affordeth ſuch a Certainty as is unqueſtionable, becauſe of the Evidence of that Certainty: as that King <hi>James</hi> was King of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. and of the matter in queſtion we have as great, and in it ſelf far greater. But of this elſewhere. 2. If Divine Faith give us a Certainty without objective Evidence, then it is miraculous or contrary to nature, or at leaſt above it (not only as rectifying diſabled nature, which I grant, but) as moving man not as man, or the Intellect not as an Intellect, which knows naturally no other Action but upon fit objects, and what is wrought by them: It knoweth no apprehenſion of truth, but as it is apparent or evidenced truth. To underſtand this Axiom to be true, <hi>All men ſhall be Judged,</hi> and to ſee no Evidence of its truth, are contradictions. 3. At leſt it cannot be concluded in general, that the objects of Faith are not evident to <hi>any,</hi> in that they were evident not only to the Prophets and Apoſtles themſelves, but to all the Churches in that age where they wrought their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. For as the <hi>formale fidei objectum,</hi> viz. <hi>Veracitas Revelantis,</hi> is evident to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo to all that have not loſt reaſon; ſo that God himſelf was the Author or Revealer, was evident to all them whoſe eyes and ears were witneſſes of the frequent Miracles, Languages and Gifts of the Spirit, whereby the truth was then ſealed by God. 4. That which hath no Evidence, cannot be Rationally preached to the world: But the Doctrine of Faith may be Rationally preached to the world; therefore Preaching hath a natural tendency to mens Converſion. It is a ſhewing men the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Goſpel Truth, and the goodneſs of Goſpel objects, and ſo thereby per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading men to Believe the one, and Love and Accept the other. He that doth not <hi>praedicare Evidentiam veritatis Evangelicae,</hi> doth not preach the Goſpel, in the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as he that preacheth not the goodneſs of Chriſt and his benefits, doth not preach it in the other. Preaching is not like Chriſts laying on clay and ſpittle, which hath no natural tendency to open the eyes: For the effect of Preaching, as ſuch, is not miraculous, no nor ſupernaturally otherwiſe then as the Doctrine preached being of ſupernatural Revelation, may be ſaid to be a ſupernatural Cauſe, and ſo relatively the effect called ſupernatural: though the ſame effect as proceeding from the Spirit which is a Concauſe, or ſuperior Cauſe, may be truly called ſupernatural. 5. That which
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55369:81"/>
may be diſcerned to be certain Truth, without ſpecial or extraordinary Grace, even by wicked men and Divels, hath ſome evidence which cauſeth this diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or belief: But ſuch is the Doctrine of Faith; therefore. I know ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines to the no ſmall wrong of the Chriſtian Faith, ſay, None can really believe it, but the Regenerate. But the Jews believe the ſupernatural Revelations of the Old Teſtament, and the Divels and many a thouſand wicked men believe, both old and new; experience tells us ſo: Chriſt tells us ſo, that many believe who fall away in perſecution. <hi>James</hi> tells ſuch men, that they do well in believing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Divel doth ſo too: elſe men could not reject or perſecute the known Truth. To conclude it is commonly ſaid that infuſed Habits, <hi>infunduntur ad m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum acquiſitorum</hi>; and therefore the habit of Faith in the Intellect muſt be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by an Impreſs of evidence: Though the Spirits ſupernatural act be more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over neceſſary, yet that makes not other cauſes unneceſſary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rada,</hi> who concludes, that <hi>Theologia noſtra non eſt evidens,</hi> gives but theſe two poor reaſons (and I ſhould as ſoon look for ſtrong ones from him, as almoſt any man of his Religion or party) 1. <hi>Principia Concluſionum noſtrae Theologiae non ſunt nobis Evidentia, ſed Condita</hi>: therefore <hi>nec Concluſiones,</hi> &amp;c. I deny the Antecedent, which he proves nor; <hi>Veracitas Divina eſt formale objectum fidei,</hi> and that is evident, ſo is the Revelation, as is ſaid. 2. He ſaith, <hi>Si concluſiones noſtrae Theologiae eſſent Evidentes, poſſemus convincere Infideles, ut fidem noſtram ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciperent, quia Evidentia convincit Intellectum.</hi> I anſwer, 1. The greateſt Evidence ſuppoſeth other neceſſary concurrents for conviction, as a Will to underſtand, and divers other things which the wicked want. As it is not for want of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of preſent Objects, but for want of good eyes that a blinde man ſeeth not; ſo it is here. 2. Many Infidels do Believe without ſpecial Grace: though not ſo deeply and clearly as to prevail with their Wills for a through converſion; yea the Divels themſelves believe. And whereas he adds <hi>Pauls</hi> words, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>We walk by Faith, not by ſight</hi>; it ſpeaks not of Rational Evidence, but of ſenſitive, and that we confeſs is wanting. Faith is the Evidence of things not ſeen, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. Were it not for digreſſing too far, I would examine the 9. <hi>Queſt. Mater.</hi> 14. <hi>de fide</hi> of <hi>Aquinas de Veritate,</hi> and ſhew how ill he anſwers the nine Arguments, which he undertakes to anſwer, and how weak his own Arguments are for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that <hi>fides non poteſt eſſe de rebus ſcitis.</hi> And I ſhould ſhew that Faith is a kinde of Science; or if we will diſtinguiſh it from Science, it muſt not be ſo wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as is uſual, nor upon the reaſon that it wanteth Evidence. But I ſuppoſe he that will impartially read <hi>Aquinas ubi ſup.</hi> will without any help ſee the weakneſs of his anſwers, and how he ſeemed to ſtagger himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Yet let me add this caution or two; 1. I do not mean that every man who hath true Faith, doth diſcern the great and chiefeſt Evidence of the Truth of the Doctrine of Faith. 2. Where there is the ſame Evidence in the thing, there may be ſuch different apprehenſions of it, through the diverſity of Intellectual capacities and preparations, as that one may have a firme Belief, and certain, and another but a probable opinion, and another none at all. 3. Though I take the Evidence of the Doctrine of Faith to be as full as I have mentioned, yet not ſo obvious and eaſily diſcerned as ſenſitive evidence; and therefore (as one cauſe) there are fewer believe, 4. Alſo the diſtance of the objects of Faith makes them work leſs on the affections, and the preſence and other advantages of ſenſual Objects for a facile moving the Spirits, makes them carrie men away ſo potently, by making greater Commotions in the paſſions; ſo that no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55369:82"/>
if ſenſe do prevail with moſt. I confeſs alſo that men have need of good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Antiquity and other Hiſtory, and the Seal of the Church in moſt parts of the world, to ſee the ſtrong Evidence that there is of the Infallible Tradition of the Scriptures down to us: and to ſome obſcure men, this may be inevident; as it may be to one brought up in a ſecret Cloiſter, whether ever we had a King or Parliament or Laws in <hi>England.</hi> But the thing is not therefore inevident to the induſtrious; No though it depend on that verity of Report, which as proceeding from each particular perſon is contingent; ſeeing there is Evidence of Infallible Verity even in the Circumſtances of theſe Contingent reports. And as <hi>Rada,</hi> when he concludes boldly that <hi>Cognitio Dei reſpectu Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingentium non eſt proprie &amp; ſcientia, &amp;c.</hi> yet ſeems to grant that God may <hi>ſcire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingentia u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But I finde <hi>I</hi> have been drawn beyond my intent to digreſs far on this point: but it is becauſe it tends to clear the main point in queſtion. To return there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> I do not know the meaning of his next words, where he ſaith, that <hi>This Argument Well followed, would put me to a great loſs in ſome of my Arguments for Scripture, &amp;c.</hi> Doth he think that I argue to prove the Divinity of Scriptures, from themſelves alone as the Teſtifier thereof to our Faith? or that, I take it to be meerly or primarily <hi>de fide,</hi> that Scripture is Gods Revelation? when I have profeſſedly publiſhed the contrary, before thoſe Arguments? where I have alſo added theſe words of Mr. <hi>Rich. Hooker,</hi> wherewith I will conclude this Section. <hi>Truly it is not a thing impoſsible, nor greatly hard, even by ſuch kinde of proofs ſo to manifeſt and clear that point, that no man living ſhall be able to deny it, without denying ſome apparent principles, ſuch as all men acknowledge to be true.</hi> Again, <hi>Scripture teacheth us that ſaving Truth which God hath diſcovered to the world by Revelation; but it preſumeth us taught otherwiſe, that it ſelf is Divine and Sacred.</hi> Again, <hi>Theſe things we believe, knowing by Reaſon that Scripture is the Word of God.</hi> Again, <hi>It is not required, nor can be exacted at our hands, that we ſhould yield it any other Aſſent then ſuch as doth anſwer the Evidence.</hi> Again, <hi>How bold and confident ſoever we may be in words; when it comes to the tryal, ſuch as the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is which the Truth hath, ſuch is the Aſſent; nor can it be ſtronger if ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as it ſhould be</hi>; ſo far Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> cited once more; <hi>Eccleſ. pol. p.</hi> 102, 103, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

All the quarrel ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from the divers underſtanding of the term <hi>ſealed.</hi> I ſuppoſe that you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the confirming of the Receiver, and the conferring of Right to the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, both which I have ſaid are done Conditionally, as being to follow the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and Reception; whereas I take it for the <hi>Teſtimonium ſecundarium,</hi> or that Obſignation whereby the Inſtrument is owned: the following effects belonging to it in a further reſpect. I ever granted that by the ſealing of the Conditional Promiſe, the Believer hath a ſingular help to raiſe the Concluſion, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in it; but not a help ſufficient, without the diſcerning of his own Faith, which is the Aſſumption. So that if you will, <hi>participaliter</hi> and <hi>conſequenter,</hi> the Concluſion may be ſaid to be ſealed to him that hath the Condition (whether he ſee it, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> not). But <hi>totaliter &amp; directè</hi> only the Conditional grant is ſealed. 3. The Concluſion iſſues from, and hath its ſtrength from both Premiſes jointly, and no more from one alone, then if it were none at all: and therefore where only one of the Premiſes is ſealed, and the other unſealed, there the Concluſion can be but as I ſaid, <hi>participaliter &amp; conſequenter</hi> ſealed: And though I grant thus much to you for reconciliation, yet I conceive it unfit to ſay at all, as in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſpeech, that the Concluſion is ſealed: which I make good by this Argument. <hi>Concluſio ſequitur partem debiliorem, vel deteriorem. At Propoſitio non obſignata est pars debilior vel deterior</hi>: therefore <hi>Concluſio ſequitur Propoſitionem non obſignatam.</hi> And ſo it is on the ſame grounds to be denominated, <hi>not ſealed</hi>; as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is to be denominated Contingent, when one of the Premiſes is Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and the other Neceſſary; or to be <hi>Negative,</hi> when one of the Premiſes is Negative and the other Affirmative; or to be <hi>Particular,</hi> when one of the Premiſes is Particular and the other Univerſal; And therefore <hi>I</hi> ſtill ſay, that it is fitteſt for you and me to ſay, that this Concluſion, <hi>Thou</hi> A. B. <hi>art Juſtified, and haſt Right to Salvation,</hi> is an unſealed Concluſion: till you can prove the Minor ſealed, <hi>Thou</hi> A.

                        <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. I Never heard of, nor knew a Conditional ſealing in the world: though I have oft heard of the effects of Obligation and Collation of Right to be Conditional, which are not only ſeparable from the <hi>Terminus proximus</hi> of ſealing, but alſo are directly the effects of the Covenant, Promiſe, Teſtament, &amp;c. only, and but remotely of the Seals, inaſmuch as that Seal is a full owning of the Inſtrument of Conveyance. Yet ſuch a thing as a Conditional ſealing may be imagined, ſeeing ſealing is a Moral Civil action, and ſo dependeth <hi>quoad formam</hi> on the will of the Agent after the matter is put; the Agent may if he pleaſe put the matter now, and introduce the form upon a future Condition (or a preſent, or a paſt) as if he ſhould ſet the wax and material ſeal to a Deed of Gift, with this addition, <hi>I hereby ſeal to this, or own it as my deed, if ſuch a man be now living in</hi> France; <hi>or if ſuch a Ship be ſafe arrived: or if ſuch a man ſhall do ſuch a thing; otherwiſe this ſhall be no ſeal.</hi> But ſuch exceptions or conditions being alwaies added to the Inſtrument or Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal obligation or conveyance, and being of no uſe as to the ſeals only, I never heard of ſuch, nor I think ever ſhall do. For if all theſe or any of theſe Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be in the Deed or Obligation, the Seal doth but confirm that Conditional Obligation, though it be abſolutely and actually a Seal: and therefore doth not oblige the Author actually, but conditionally: and therefore to feign a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional ſealing, beſides the conditional Covenanting or Granting, ſeems very uſeleſs and vain, to ſay no more.</p>

                        <hi>R. B.</hi> 1. IT is ſo rare a thing for men to manifeſt ſo much ingenuity and ſelf denyal and impartial love to the Truth, as freely to recant what they have once aſſerted when they finde it a miſtake, that if this had been your caſe, I would not have been one that ſhould have blamed you for it, or charged you with unconſtancy or levity. To err, is common to all men: but freely to recant it, is not ſo. I never write, but with a ſuppoſition that I ſhall manifeſt the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my Intellect, and do that which needs reformation. 2. I did not ſo much as pretend you to be my Adverſary; I did defend you, and not argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you: and therefore you have little need to perſwade me to have lower thoughts of our differences then I did expreſs, or that you and I were no adverſaries.</p>
                     <p>But though I make light of our ſeeming difference about ſealing, I muſt intreat you to remember, that I not only maintain my former Aſſertion, <hi>that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, I</hi> A. B. <hi>am Juſtified, is not</hi> de fide, but that I account it a matter of far greater moment.</p>
                     <p>It hath been too common Doctrine among the moſt renowned Divines, that it is not only <hi>de fide,</hi> but every mans duty alſo, yea a part of the Creed, and ſo a fundamental, for to Believe that our ſins are remitted, (for ſo they expound the Article of Remiſſion of ſins). I will not name the Authors, becauſe I honor
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55369:84"/>
them, and would not ſeem to diſparage them; and the Learned know them already: yea they earneſtly preſs men to Believe the pardon of their own ſins in particular, and tell them that they have but the Faith of Devils elſe. By which dangerous Doctrine, 1. moſt men are perſwaded to believe a falſhood: for moſt are not forgiven. 2. The careleſs world is driven on faſter to preſumption, to which they are ſo prone of themſelves. 3. Painful Miniſters are hindred, and their labors fruſtrated, whoſe buſineſs is firſt to break mens falſe hopes and peace; which they finde ſo hard a work, that they need not reſiſtance. The ungodly that I deal with, are ſo confident that their ſin is forgiven, and God will not damn them for it, that all that I can ſay is too little to ſhake their confidence, which is the nurſe of their ſin. 4. Gods word, yea the Articles of our Creed, muſt be abuſed to do Satan this ſervice, and mens Souls this wrong. All the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde ſo ſtrong a prop to the Kingdom of the Devil, nor ſo powerful an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to preſumption or any ſin, as miſtaken Scripture (either miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted or miſapplyed). 5. When wicked men, that have but the Faith of Devils, are immediately required to believe the pardon of their own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſins, and this made to be <hi>de fide,</hi> God is diſhonored with the charge of ſuch untruths, as if falſhoods were <hi>de fide,</hi> and God commanded men to believe them.</p>
                     <p>And for the Godly themſelves, it hath in a lower degree many of the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences. If there be any one that hath as good Evidence of his ſoundneſs in Faith, Love and Repentance, as that the Word of God is true, and all ſound Believers are Juſtified; what is ſuch a man to many a thouſand that have no ſuch Evidence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea and for that man, it is impoſſible that his Evidence ſhould be as conſtant, as Scripture Evidence, though it were as full. Scripture Evidence varieth not, as the Evidence of Grace doth in our mutable unconſtant Souls: But for my part I never yet ſaw the face of that ſober man (to my knowledge) who durſt ſay, That he was as ſure or as confident of his own ſincerity, as of the Truth of Gods Word, and particularly of that Promiſe, <hi>He that Believeth ſhall not periſh, but have Everlaſting life.</hi> And as I have oft ſaid already, The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion may not be ſaid to be <hi>de fide,</hi> unleſs the other Propoſition he as evident as that which is <hi>de fide</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe <hi>Concluſio ſequitur partem deteriorem.</hi> Yea let me be bold to grow a little higher, and to tell you that it ſeems to me impoſſible and a contradiction that any man ſhould be more certain that he Believeth ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, then he is that Gods Word is true, or that the Promiſe is Gods Word, which he doth Believe. For the truth of God in his Word, is the formal object of Faith, without which there can be no Faith. No man therefore can be more certain that he believes truly, then he is that Gods Word is true: For to Believe, is to apprehend the certain Truth of the Word. And none can be more certain that he apprehends the word as certain, then he is that the word is certain. If you ſay, I am certain that I believe the certainty of the word, but weakly: I anſwer, At leſt then the ſaving ſincerity of your Faith will be as uncertain to you, as the word is, if not the being of that Faith. And then there is no more certainty, I think, rationally and ordinarily, then there is Evidence.</p>

                        <hi>Mr. Bl. A</hi> Second opinion is, that the Covenant of Grace requires perfection in the exacteſt way, without help of theſe mens diſtinctions, in an equal degree with the Covenant of Works, but with this difference; in the Covenant of Works, there is no indulgence or diſpenſation in caſe of failing, but the penalty takes hold, the Curſe follows upon it: But the Covenant of Grace, though it call for perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſuch is the exactneſs of it, yet it accepts of ſincerity, ſuch is the qualification of it through Grace, or the mercy in it. If I ſhould take up any opinion in the world for the Authors ſake, or thoſe that have appeared as Patrons of it, then I ſhould embrace this: The Reverence deſervedly due to him that I ſuppoſe firſt manifeſted himſelf in it, hath cauſed it to finde great entertainment. But upon more then twenty years thoughts about it, I finde it labouring under manifold inconveniences.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. I began to conjecture that the Reverend perſon that you mean is Mr. <hi>Ball</hi>; and yet methinks, you ſhould not ſuppoſe him the Author: It is therefore ſure ſome one much elder.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For the thing it ſelf, if I may ſhoot my bolt, upon a ſhorter deliberation, I conceive, that all your difference with the men of that Judgement, is occaſioned by the Ambiguity and various acception of the word <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> which in my judgement, you ought to have removed, by diſtinguiſhing, before you had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued againſt their opinion. The term <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> is ſometime taken ſtrictly for the Contract alone; either 1. for the full Contract, which is mutual or by both parties, which is moſt properly called a Covenant: Or 2. for the engagement of one part only: 1. either for Gods Promiſe. 2. or mans. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Condition is implyed, not as commanded, but as tendred. Now it is certain that taking the <hi>Covenant</hi> in this reſtrained ſenſe, it doth not command Perfection of obedience, for it commands nothing at all: nor doth it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it as the Condition, for then we were undone. But then it muſt be known
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55369:85"/>
that this is too reſtrained a ſenſe for us ordinarily to uſe the word <hi>Covenant</hi> in; God hath made no ſuch Covenant with us, which is not a Law in one reſpect, as well as a Covenant in another: He layes not by his Soveraignty in Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Nay they are all more properly called Laws then Covenants: Even the Promiſe it ſelf is moſt properly <hi>Lex Gratiae Remedians,</hi> Like an act of Oblivion or Pardon to a Nation of Rebels. Yet comparatively, the Law of Grace is far more fitly called a Covenant then the Law of Nature (which perhaps is never ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Scripture), becauſe the Promiſſory part is the predominant part in the Law of Grace, the precept being but ſubſervient to that; but the preceptive part is moſt predominant in the Law of nature; the Promiſe being not ſo much as expreſſed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and obſcure in nature it ſelf, ſo that it will hold great diſpute, whether God were obliged at all to Reward man with heavenly Glory, yea or any proper Reward (beſides non-puniſhment which is improperly a Reward). The Lutherans are the leaders of that evil cuſtom and conceit of denying the Goſpel to be a Law. 2. In the next place therefore the word <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> is taken for the New Law, containing Precept, Prohibition, Promiſe and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And here it is taken 1. ſo narrowly as to comprize only the Precept of Believing, with the Promiſe and Threatning annext, as being indeed the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. Sometime more largely, as containing alſo the Precepts that Chriſt hath given the Church ſince his coming, that were not before given: Principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of Believing Jeſus to be the Chriſt, and alſo thoſe of Miniſtery, Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Church-Aſſemblies, &amp;c. together with the Doctrines or Articles of Faith which he ſince revealed. 3. Sometime it is more largely taken for that whole Syſteme of Doctrines, Hiſtories and Laws (Precepts, Promiſes, and Threats) which directly concern the Recovery of faln mankinde. 4. Sometime for as much of theſe as was delivered before Chriſts coming, in Promiſes, Propheſies and Types, &amp;c. 5. Sometime for as much of theſe as yet remains in force, whether delivered to the Church before the Incarnation or ſince, (for many Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants or Evangelical Promiſes and Precepts, are ceaſed now that were in force before: as that Chriſt ſhould be born, and they ſhould accept his birth, &amp;c.) This laſt ſenſe, containeth the Doctrine of Redemption by Chriſt, and the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of his birth, life and Death and Reſurrection (as Narrations of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, end and matter are uſual appurtenances of a Law) as alſo the Precepts of Repenting and Believing; Loving God for our Redemption, and Chriſt as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; Loving men as Redeemed ones, and as Members of Chriſt; Miniſtry, Sacraments, Church-aſſemblies, proper to the Goſpel, with the means to be uſed for getting, keeping or improving this Grace as ſuch; the command of Hope, or looking for Chriſts ſecond coming, &amp;c. and of ſincere obedience. I conceive the firſt (as containing the ſumme of all) and ſpecially this laſt (as containing the whole Syſteme of the Doctrine and Laws of our Redemption and Reſtauration) are the fitteſt ſenſes for us ordinarily to uſe the word <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace</hi> in (<hi>vide</hi> Grotii <hi>diſſertationem de nomine <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> ante Annotat. in Novum Teſtam.</hi>) Now if the queſtion be whether in any of theſe ſenſes the New Covenant doth command perfect obedience; I anſwer, All the doubt is of the 3 latter: But I rather think negatively, that in none of theſe Acceptions can the New Covenant be ſaid to require perfect obedience. 6. But then ſome take the New Law or Covenant for the whole Law that now ſtands unrepealed, and obligeth the Subjects of the Mediator, ſuppoſing the Moral Law to be now the Law or Covenant of Grace, <hi>i. e.</hi> the matter of it, as it was formerly the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55369:86"/>
matter of the Law of Works: and that the Covenant of Works being totally and abſolutely Abrogated, the Moral Law muſt be the material part of the Covenant or Law of Grace, or of none: and of ſome it muſt be: For God gives no precepts but upon ſome terms, or with ſome ſanction of Reward or Puniſhment: And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they ſay, that it is now the Moral Law which is the matter of the new Covenant, which commandeth perfect obedience. This is maintained by an acquaintance and friend of Mr. <hi>Blakes,</hi> a man of extraordinary Learning and Judgement, eſpecially as throughly ſtudyed in theſe things as any that ever I was acquainted with. For my part, (though I think, the difference is moſt in notions and terms, yet) I ſtill judge, that the Law of Works, that is, the Precept and Threatning, are not abrogated, though the Promiſe of that Law be Ceaſed, and ſo it is not ſo fitly now called a Covenant; and ſome particular Precepts are abrogate or ceaſed; and ſo I think it is this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Law of nature which Commandeth perfect obedience, and ſtill pronounceth Death, the due puniſhment of our diſobedience. But I acknowledge even this Law of Nature to be now the Law of Chriſt, who as Redeemer of all mankinde, hath Nature and its Law and all things elſe delivered unto him, to diſpoſe of to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his Redemption Ends: But ſtill I ſuppoſe this Law of Nature to be ſo far from being the ſame with the Law of Grace, that it is this which the Law of Grace Relaxeth, and whoſe obligation it diſſolveth, when our ſins are forgiven. So that the difference is but in the Notion of Unity or Diverſity, whether (ſeeing all is Now the Redeemers Law) it be fitter to ſay, It is one Law; or that, They are two diſtinct Laws. For in the matter we are agreed, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Promiſe of the firſt Law is ceaſed, (becauſe God cannot be obliged to a ſubject made uncapable) and ſome particular Precepts are ceaſed <hi>Ceſſante materia,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> Jewiſh Law is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ceaſed, and partly abrogate; and that there is now in force as the Redeemers Law, the Precept of perfect obedience, and the Threatning of Death to every ſin, with a Grant of Remiſſion and ſalvation to all that ſincerely Repent and Believe, and a threatning of far ſorer puniſhment to the Impenitent and Unbelievers. Thus far the Agreement. The diſagreement is but this; I think that though theſe are both the Redeemers Laws, yet they are to be taken as two; One in this forme, <hi>Perfect Obedience is thy Duty (or obey perfectly): Death is thy Due for every ſin.</hi> The other in this forme, <hi>Repent and Believe, and thou ſhall be ſaved (from the former curſe): Or elſe damned.</hi> Others thinks that it is fitter to ſay that theſe two are but one Law, <hi>quoad formam,</hi> running thus, <hi>I command to thee faln man, perfect obedience, and oblige thee to Puniſhment for every ſin; Yet not remedileſly; but ſo as that if thou Believe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, this Obligation ſhall be diſſolved, and thou ſaved; elſe not.</hi> To this purpoſe the foreſaid Learned, Judicious, and much honored Brother, explains his opinion to me. Now as long as we agree that the former Law, or part of the Law, (call it which you will) doth Actually oblige to perfect obedience, or future Death; and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Law, or part of the Law, doth upon the performance of the Condition, diſſolve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>To apply this now to Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> Queſtion; It is moſt likely that thoſe Divines that affirm that the Covenant of Grace doth require perfect obedience, and Accept ſincere, do take that Covenant in this laſt and largeſt ſenſe; and as containing the Moral Law as part of its matter; and ſo no doubt it is true, if you underſtand it of perfection for the future, as ſpeaking to a creature already made imperfect. Now ſeeing

If you take them (as no doubt you do) as meaning it of the Law of Chriſt (as the Trent Council expreſs themſelves) then, no doubt, but they take the Law of Chriſt in the ſame extended ſenſe as was before expreſſed; and then they differ from us but in the forementioned Notion: But then I ſuppoſe you wrong them by making them righter then they are: For the very paſſages which you before expreſſed out of ſome of the chief of their writers, do intimate that they do not indeed take the Covenant or Law it ſelf to command true Perfection: but that which they call Perfection, is but (as you ſay) <hi>No other then the Grace of Sanctification in the very ſenſe as the Orthodox hold it out</hi>; But it is true perfection that thoſe mean whom you now write againſt.

                        <hi>R. B.</hi> THis charge proceedeth meerly from the confounding of the Duty as ſuch, and the Condition as ſuch. A Covenant which is alſo a Law as well as a Covenant, may by the preceptive part Conſtitute much more Duty then ſhall be made the Condition of the Promiſes. Properly it is only the non-performance of the Condition that is Covenant-breaking; and ſo the Divines whom you oppoſe are not chargeable with your Conſequent: For they ſay not that <hi>The Covenant of Grace doth make perfect Obedience the Condition of its Promiſe, and Accept Imperfect.</hi> That were a flat contradiction: for the Condition is <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non, &amp; cum quâ:</hi> But only they ſay, It Requireth or Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth perfect obedience, and Accepteth imperfect. And if you will ſpeak ſo large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as to ſay, that all who break the preceptive part of the Covenant, are Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-breakers, then no doubt but God Accepteth of many ſuch, and of none but ſuch. And as the word <hi>Covenant</hi> is not taken for the mutual contract, but for Gods new Law, called his Covenant, his Teſtament, his Diſpoſition, Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Ordination, &amp;c. ſo no doubt, we all are Covenant-breakers. For whether we ſay that the new Law commandeth perfect obedience, or not; yet unleſs you take it exceeding reſtrainedly, it muſt be acknowledged that the Precept is of lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger extent then the Condition, having appointed ſome Duties which it hath not made <hi>ſine qua non</hi> to ſalvation: If you ſend your childe a mile of an errand, and ſay <hi>I charge you play not by the way, but make haſte, and do not go in the dirt, &amp;c. and if you come back by ſuch an houre, I will give you ſuch a Reward; if not, you ſhall be whipt</hi>; He that playes by the way and dirties himſelf, and yet comes back by the hour appointed, doth break the preceptive part, but not the condition. Or if you ſuppoſe a re-engagement by Promiſe to do both theſe: he breaketh his own Covenant in the firſt reſpect (which was not the condition of Reward or Puniſhment) but not in the ſecond. And ſo do true Chriſtians both break the preceptive part of the Covenant, and alſo ſome of their own particular cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants with God: as when a man promiſeth, I will commit this ſin no more, or I will perform ſuch a duty ſuch a day. But theſe are not the Conditions of the Covenant of Grace, which God hath made the <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non</hi> of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or Salvation.

                        <hi>Mr. Bl.</hi> THe alone Argument, ſo far as ever I could learn, that hath brought ſome of Reverend eſteem into this opinion, is, That if the Covenant requires not exact perfection in the ſame height as the Law calls for it, then a Chriſtian may fall ſhort of the Law in his Obedience, and not ſin; perfection being not called for from him, nor any more called for from him then through Grace he doth perform; he riſes as high as his Rul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this Argument is not of weight: Chriſt entring a Goſpel-Covenant with man, findes him under the command of the Law, which command the Law ſtill holds, the Goſpel being a confirmation, not a deſtruction of it.

                        </gap>n is a ſin upon that account, that it is a Tranſgreſsion of the Law, though (being done againſt heart, and labored againſt) it is no breach of Covenant: wee are under the Law as men; we are taken into Covenant as Chriſtians: retaining the humane nature, the Law ſtill commands as; though the covenant in Chriſt through the abundant Grace of it, upon the terms that it requires and accepts, frees us from the ſentence of it.</p>

I Was at firſt doubtful, leſt by <hi>the Law</hi> you had meant (as the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi>) a Law of God in general, as oppoſed to the Goſpel as being no Law: and that you had meant by the Law, only the Moral Precepts, which is but the matter of the Law of Nature or of Works, or of the Law of Grace (in ſome reſpect). But I perceive that you mean the entire Law, both Precept and Sanction, by your mentioning <hi>the Sentence</hi> of it. If therefore you do by <hi>the Law</hi> mean but one Species, <hi>viz.</hi> the Law of Nature, acknowledging the new Law of Grace (commonly called the New Covenant, from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which is the moſt eminent part) to be a Law too, then I agree with you in this ſolution as to the matter of Perfection; or elſe not. And yet I dare not hold that the New Law commandeth no more then its Condition. But for them that uſe the word <hi>Covenant</hi> for nothing but the bare Promiſe, I muſt tell them, that it is but a piece of Gods Law or Inſtrument, ſeparated from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which they faſten a Name upon: and if they will ſignifie ſo much, that it is but part of the Redeemers Law of Grace, which they call a Covenant, and will give another name to the whole, that ſo we may underſtand them, I would not willingly quarrel with them about words. But if it be the thing as well as the name that they err in, affirming that the Goſpel is a meer Promiſe, and that God hath no Law but one, and that one the Law of Works; or elſe that all his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts Natural and Poſitive, are one Law by themſelves as diſtinct from the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, when Precepts are but part of Gods Laws, which by their Sanctions are ſpecified and diſtinguiſhed (as moſt think into two ſorts, of Nature and of Grace; but as <hi>Camero</hi> thinks into three ſorts, of Nature, &amp; of Jewiſh works, &amp; of Grace) then <hi>I</hi> not only profeſs my diſſent, but do eſteem the former error very dangerous and intolerable; and the later, ſuch as tendeth to great confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the body of Theologie.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This very Argument which you recite and anſwer, doth undenyably prove, that the Divines whom you oppoſe, do by <hi>the Covenant of Grace,</hi> underſtand all the Law that is now in force under the Government of the Redeemer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Otherwiſe they would never imagine that there is no ſin but what is againſt the Covenant of Grace; and that there is no other Rule but this Covenant for a Chriſtians obedience. It is therefore out of doubt, that this difference is but about words, (or little more) they taking <hi>that Covenant of Grace</hi> in a larger ſenſe then you and I think meet to take it.</p>
                     <p>If you ſhould reply, that it is an unreaſonable thing of them to take it ſo largely: I ſay that I do not think meet to imitate them in it, but I could ſhew you ſo much ſaid that way by the forementioned Reverend, Learned man, your friend and mine, as would convince you that they have more to ſay for what they do, then every one that is againſt them is able to anſwer.</p>

If you ſay that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had their errors, and all this is but humane Judgement, and all men are fallible, I confeſs all this to be true: But as I ſtill ſay, that <hi>Contra.

All that I deſire by my far greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of humane Teſtimony, is but to expugn prejudice, that I may ſtand on even ground with them that contend with me: And could I but prevail for this, that the cauſe might be decided by meer Scripture-reaſon, and humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority wholly ſtand by, and the Reader could but impartially conſider things, without being, byaſſed to any <hi>ſide</hi> or <hi>party,</hi> as if he knew not what any man elſe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55369:90"/>
doth judge of it, I ſhould then make little doubt of the good iſſue of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie. The moſt that I meet with, that explain againſt my judgement, are they that confeſs that they know not what it is, or elſe apprehend it to be what it is not: but whatever it is, ſome that they value are againſt it, and that is it that ſatisfieth them that I am in an error. I do unfeignedly deſire that in dark Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies beyond their reach, the unlearned people would more regard the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of ſober Godly Divines, then any ſingle and ſingular Teacher; yea though it fall out that he be in the Truth, as long as the Evidence of that Truth is out of their reach. But this may not encourage any to ſhut their eyes, or to neglect to ſearch after the Evidence which they might diſcern, much leſs may it excuſe ſuch unfaithfulneſs in Divines themſelves; nor yet may it encourage any to captivate their judgement to a party, againſt the general judgement of the Church: For if I were on one ſide, and all the Divines in <hi>England</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there is yet the ſame reaſon to prefer all the firſt Churches, before all them, as there is to prefer all them before me. In a word, I ſhall ever think him more culpably ſingular, who differeth from Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and all his Church for 1200 or 1400 years, then he that differeth from any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty now living, and differeth not from them forementioned. And how the caſe ſtands in this between me, and thoſe Reverend Divines that oppoſe me, in the foreſaid points of difference, I am heartily content to refer to any ſober, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reader, that takes not things on truſt from others, nor judgeth of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of antient writers, by any imperfect diſmembred parcels.</p>

                  <p>I diſtinguiſh between the Real Operations and Mutations on mans ſoul, by Objects; and the Conveyance of Right to ſeveral Benefits by the Covenant of God. It is not the former that I ſpeak of in that place. I confeſs that as the Apprehenſion of one of Gods Attributes, makes one effect on the ſoul, and the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of another makes another effect, ſo the apprehenſion of Chriſts Kingdome, Righteouſneſs, Death, Obedience, Interceſsion, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do make alſo their ſeveral Impreſsions according to the Nature of the thing apprehended. But I utterly deny that it is ſo in Conveying Right to theſe, as much as I deny that Juſtification is Sanctification, or a Real Change of our Qualities as it is. This therefore is my Argument: If the Apprehenſion of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, and no other Act, ſhould ſtrictly be the Justifying Act of Faith, and that <hi>eo nomine,</hi> becauſe it is the object of that apprehenſion which is the matter of our Juſtification, then it would follow, <hi>1.</hi> That the Apprehenſion of nothing elſe is the Juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Act. <hi>2.</hi> And that we have Right to every other particular Mercy <hi>eo nomine,</hi> becauſe we apprehend that Mercy, and ſo our Right to every particular Benefit of Chriſt, were Received by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Act of Faith, But the Conſequent is falſe. Therefore ſo is the Antecedent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:55369:92"/>The <hi>minor</hi> only requires proof: which is proved by the tenour of the Covenant of Grace, which Giveth us Chriſt, and with him all things: <hi>He that hath the Son hath Life: He that believeth on him ſhall not periſh, nor come into Condemnation. As many as Received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God.</hi> So that one entire faith, which is the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Chriſt as he is offered, that is, as our Saviour and King, is the Condition of our Right to all particular Benefits. <hi>Godlineſs hath the promiſe of this life, and that to come.</hi> It is a womans taking ſuch a man for her Husband that Gives her firſt Intereſt in him, and then in all that he hath: It is not accepting this houſe, and that Land, and that Servant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that gives her a distinct right in them. There is not a marrying to all theſe, and a particular Acceptance of every of his Goods and Chattel requiſite to a right in them, though there be to a uſe of them. <hi>2.</hi> And the Opinion being utterly unproved is ſufficiently confuted. In what Book that ever was written have theſe nice diſtinguiſhers proved their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by Scripture or ſound reaſon? <hi>Lex non diſtinguit, ergo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>3.</hi> And it diſcovers its own abſurdity: For if this be true, then to apprehend Chriſts death is the only act that gives right to that, and to apprehend his obedience to that; and to apprehend Adoption is the only act that gives right to that, and ſo of all other benefits: So that there ſhould be one act of Faith giving right to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and another giving right to pardon, another to ſentential Juſtification, another to Adoption, another to the Spirit and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, another to Perſeverance, another to Glory: Yea one to every particular gift or part of Sanctification; and one to the pardon of every particular known ſin that is pardoned: One to the Goſpel written, another to the Miniſtry, one to health, another to life, and one to every bleſsing. And ſo that act of faith which Receives Adoption ſhould not Juſtifie, nor that which Receives Chriſt himſelf neither directly: but only that which receiveth Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. Whereas it is one Reception, or Act of faith morally taken (Apprehending the entire object) that God hath made the Condition of his Promiſe. So that to apprehend Chriſt as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
<pb facs="tcp:55369:92"/>
of Glory, doth as much towards our Juſtification, as appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending him as Juſtifier: And to Believe in him as our San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifier and King, doth as Really conduce to our Juſtification, and as much, as the apprehending him as one that will pardon our ſins. <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved,</hi> is the ſimple Scripture doctrine. <hi>4.</hi> And if all this were not ſo, yet it is the apprehending of Chriſt as King according to them then, that muſt be the Pardoning and Juſtifying act, more then as a Sacrifice: For as Satisfier and a Ranſome, he only meriteth our Pardon and Juſtification. But to pardon by Grant, is unqueſtionably an act of Soveraignty as ſuch: It being not the pardon of a private injury, but a publick Crime that we have to ſpeak of. And to Juſtifie by Plea is Chriſts act as an Advocate, and not as a Sacrifice. And to Juſtifie by ſentence is Chriſts act as Judge: So that if their own Doctrine did hold (of the diverſifying of our Right by the diverſity of the formal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the object apprehended) then would it but infallibly prove againſt them, that it is the Receiving of Chriſt as King and Judge that is the Act of Pardoning and Juſtifying faith, more then the Receiving him as a Sacrifice or Ranſome.</p>
