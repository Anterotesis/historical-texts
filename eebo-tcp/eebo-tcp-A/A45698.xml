            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN or near the seventh moneth, 1668. the Bishop of <hi>Liechfield</hi> came to preach, upon a first Day, at <hi>Polesworth</hi>; whether many people resorted to see and hear; who, for his Text, clothed himself with the words of the Psalmist <hi>David,</hi> to the fourth verse of the first Psalm: And after he had pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> neither is he worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in Temples made with hands; for he is a Spirit, and is worshipped in the Spirit and in Truth; therefore I warn all again to repent, and return unto the Lord; for it is their sin that makes the only separation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man, but he that repents, and forsakes, and returns to the Lord, there is Mercy with him</hi>: When he had thus spoken, the Bishop (<hi>Ieroboam</hi> like) cryed for some to lay hands on him, and would not reason out the matter, but soon gets his way, and left the people in a confused noise; and had all the rest been as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious as the Bishop, its much, if the man had not been spoiled; but many of the people knowing him to be an honest man, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Lord to work for his preservation, and at that time had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty out of all their hands; <hi>but</hi> (as <hi>Soloman</hi> saith) <hi>anger resteth in the bosome of Fooles</hi>; for afterwards the Bishop sent to warn him to his court; so the young man went according to time and place, and desired, seeing the Bishop would not stay at the Steeple-house<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that now he would appear to maintain, in his own court, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52597:4"/>
which he had delivered, or to own his shame; but he would not appear, nor bring him upon tryal, so the man returned home: But the Woolf divised another way, giving order to the Priest of the place to excommunicate him, which the Priest said he would do; and then said he, If any one run him through with a Sword, and kill him, there is no Law against them: You that have an understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, judge what Spirit rules this man; he also told the young man, that he had better have broke the commands of God, and committed Adultry with any lewd woman, or to have layn drunk under a Hedge that while, meaning that time whilst he cryed against sin, and called to repentance, Oh Neighbours and People! was ever the like heard? surely that Prophesie is now to be fulfiled, <hi>their Folly shall be manifest to all men, and they shall not proceed much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>; it's like this Priest is brother to Priest <hi>Vincent</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> who said, Its better to go to a Bawdy-house, then to go to <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Meetings; surely the Merchants of <hi>Babylon</hi> are casting du<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own heads, because the Day is dawned, that people will buy their wares no more: The same Priest at another time, told me, I deserved to be whipt at a Cart-tayl, and if he was in power to make Laws, and had the rule, he would have all such as I to be hanged, because I opposed him about Sprinkling of Children, and called for Scripture-proof: Is it not high time to post up the fruits of such Bishops and Priests as these? Oh, the very Nation stinks of them, they are a shame to the name of Christianity. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, this Bishop proceeded against his opposer, until by a private way, he sent a writ, and fetched the man out of the field, not suffering him to go speak with his tender Parents and Relations, or get his cloaths, but one pulled out a Pistol, and said, If he offered to stur from them, he would shoot him, though he never resisted; so they took him to <hi>Warwick</hi> Goal, 20 Miles from his Father's house, and there hath been kept, as a close Prisoner ever since; and if this Bishop hath not appeared more like a Woolf then a Sheep of Christ, let all true Christians judg: and hath not the spirit of <hi>Cain</hi> plainly appeared in him? for [mark] <hi>Cain</hi> was the evil doer, and the sin was laid at his door; and because of sin, his Sacrifice was not accepted; but <hi>Abel's</hi> righteous Sacrifice did witness against <hi>Cain</hi>; and then <hi>Cain</hi> (like this Bishop) was full of wrath to destroy his Brother: So let all people see, whose rule
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52597:4"/>
the Bishops and Priests walk by, <hi>Cain</hi>'s rule, for Persecution: <hi>Balaam</hi>'s rule, for Reward: <hi>Corah</hi>'s rule, for gainsaying the Truth: Now let us try the Bishop by his own Text, <hi>Psalm</hi> the first, <hi>Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly</hi>: &amp; yet at the same time, manifests whose counsel he takes, such as <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> and wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi>; but not the counsel of Christ, who bids, <hi>Love Enemies, and overcome evil with good</hi>; but it was no evil work to bid sinners to repent, and turn to God: (again as to his Text) <hi>nor standeth in the way of sinners, but delighteth in the Law of God</hi>: And yet, at the same time, himself not only standing in the way of sin, but pleading for a continuance in it term of life; surely boys and girls may see this mans confusion: Now that which fulfils the royal Laws, <hi>is to do as one would be done by</hi>; but who believes the Bishop would be served, as he hath done: Verse 3. <hi>He shall be like a Tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth fruit in due season</hi>; well, <hi>Every Tree is known by its fruit,</hi> but we see this old Thorn-like-man, doth not bring forth sweet Grapes, but untimely fruit, by which its manifest his root is not watered by a River of Life and Love; but by the foul black puddles of <hi>Egypt,</hi> such as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s hard heart and root was watered by, which made him grow up in rebellion against God, and reject the counsel of his servants, and strive to bring and keep the righteous People in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; let all people consider this, the close of the Text; <hi>The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly are like the Chaff which the wind driveth away</hi>; well, it is sin that makes a man unlike God, and that is it which this man lives in, and pleads for: And so he, and all such, are in those chaffie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and amongst the husks where the Swine feed; and when the Word and Power of the Lord appears in his Servants against them, they run, and are driven like Chaff: For if this Bishop had been of the weighty Seed, he would have taken up better Weapons, and stood to his cause: But the 5th verse saith, <hi>The ungodly shall not stand in Iudgment:</hi> And verse the 6th, <hi>The way of the ungodly shall perish</hi>: And so the Bishop's Text is opened, and he manifested to be one, that can use his tongue, to say, The Lord saith, and the Prophets say, and the Apostles testifie thus and thus; and so to strive to cover himself with sheeps clothing; but, its proved, he is ravened from that Life and Spirit of Love which dwelt in them, and by which they were guided to bring forth the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> God accepted not the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Sinners; neither is he worshipped in Temples made with hands; but according to the Scriptures of Truth declared, how that he is a Spirit, and is worshipped in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and in the Truth; and therefore I warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all to repent, and to forsake their sins; and to return to the Lord, for there is mercy with him: and this was but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Spirit of Truth, and the Apostles Doctrine; <hi>That if any thing was revealed unto him which stands by, let the first hold his peace</hi>: but herein thou manifested thy self not to be in the Apostles Doctrine;<note place="margin">Rom. 12.14. <hi>Bless them that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But I have not sinned or trespassed against thee, yet thou hast cast me into Prison only for keeping Christ's Commands; therefore greater will be thy condemnation, except thou repent, and return to the Lord, before it be too late, when there is no place of repentance to be found.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is reported we deny the Scriptures, and are unlearned, and unmannerly because we speak the Truth, as thee or thou, thy or thine to a single person; read from <hi>Genesis</hi> to the <hi>Rev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
