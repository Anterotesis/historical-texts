         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>〈1 span left blank〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>I. Obſerve one of the moſt notorious Abſurdities that was ever committed by men, that have either Sence, Reaſon, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Underſtanding, That the Perſons that give <hi>Charles Fleetwood</hi> Eſq; Commiſſion ſhall receive Commiſſion from Him: The
Reaſon why they are put to this ſhift is, That their Conſciences are ſo grated with their late impudent Rebellion, that they dare
not go to fight with Gen. <hi>Monck</hi> by their old Commiſſions, becauſe they fight againſt the bringing in of the Parliament, by
<hi>Monck</hi> juſtly and honourably endeavoured.</p>
            <p>II. What confidence can <hi>Fleetwood</hi> have in ſuch Officers, who received their Commiſſions from the Parliament but the other
day; and now, in oppoſition of that Parliament, they receive Commiſſions from Him: Who can imagine but they will be as
ready to receive new Commiſſions from <hi>Lambert,</hi> ſo ſoon as he ſhall return, if in caſe he overcome or baffle <hi>Monck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. Obſerve, That this Commiſſion that Mr. <hi>Fleetwood</hi> receiveth from his Vaſſals, is like unto that which his Father in Law
received from the Nobles and Great men of the Land, to be Protector, allyes his Grooms, Butlers, and Scullions.</p>
            <p>IV. Obſerve, That <hi>Fleetwood</hi> is by this, made an Image of Clouts, to be a Screne between <hi>Lambert</hi> and his intended Soveraignty.</p>
            <p>V. Obſerve, It is like <hi>Knipperdoling</hi>'s giving <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> Commiſſion to be King of Saints, and then <hi>John</hi> gives <hi>Knipper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doling</hi>
Commiſſion to be his Lord High Steward.</p>
            <p>VI. Obſerve, That it will ſuit well with the famous City of <hi>London,</hi> that their Militia ſhould receive Commiſſions from
this Honourable Perſon, or from the <hi>Committee of Safety,</hi> that is conſtituted, ordained, and appointed, by the very ſame Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<hi>viz.</hi> The worthy Aſſembly of grave, ſage, and illuſtrate, Council of Officers, who are Perſons well acquainted with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
pulling down, and ruining all Form, Order, and Government; but are not at all acquainted with Obedience or Duty to
their Superiours.</p>
            <p>VII. Obſerve, That General <hi>Monck</hi> hath Legal Authority for what He doth, by Acting by His Old Commiſſion, Given
by the Parliament, for that it was given Him to Act in perſuance of the Truſt Repoſed in Him from the Parliament; which
was to Defend the Common-wealth from all Uſurpations.</p>
            <p>VIII. That the Example of this his Receiving his Commiſſion from his Inferiour Officers, may as Legally be followed
by the Souldiers, Who have the ſame Power in Themſelves, to thruſt out all their Officers, and Grant Commiſſions to others, to
Exerciſe alike Devolved Authority over Them, it being the only Pattern for Rebellion and Mutiny that can be Imagined.</p>
            <p>IX. Obſerve, That by this new model, the Anabaptiſts have the only advantage to pack in their Proſelytes, that thereby all
the Authority of the three Nations may be converted into their Hands; Who are utter Enemies to the Miniſtery, the Laws, and
do really intend to deſtroy Corporations: That there may be no Hedge or Fence to any Liberty, but that all may lye open
to their Unſatiated and Unlimited Pride and Luſt.</p>
            <p>X. Obſerve, That by the ſame Rule, that the Army can Diſſolve Parliaments, and Conſtitute new ſupream Authority in whom
they pleaſe: the worſt of Rogues may do the like.</p>
            <p>XI. Obſerve, That the Superiour Officers and Powers ſhall hereafter be in like danger to be Judged, Condemned, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
by the Souldiers and Inferiours; So that you ſhall never be at any Certainty in Government, but alwayes mutable, or
ſo often as Factions can be made amongſt the Inferiors: So that the Property of Superiors being Judge of Inferior Actions,
will be quite altered to Inferiors judging Superiors.</p>
            <p>XII. Obſerve, That by this famous device of the Officers giving Commiſſion to their General, and the General giving Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to the Officers; together with the new and excellent Form of Government: the Officers of the Army ſhall be free to
all Intents and purpoſes to keep the 3 Nations in perpetual Slavery and Chains; unleſs God ſhall raiſe deliverance. Reader,
A brief Deſcription of which I ſhall here preſent thee with, but I would not have thee tell any body of it. A Committee of Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is appointed by the Army; the Committee of Safety are to appoint a Senate of Sixty; the Senate of 60 are to appoint 200:
And, in order thereunto nominate 400, to be a popular Aſſembly, out of which, the People are to elect 200, which are to ſit
once in 3 years: the Senate are to be a co-ordinate Power with the Popular Aſſembly, out of which ten are to be added unto
the Senate, and ten to go off from the Senate: The 400 that they nominate, (you may be confident) ſhall be Souldiers, Exciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Officers of the Cuſtomers, and ſuch other Perſons as have publick Salaries: So that by this means, your Nations ſhall be
kept in perpetuall Slavery, becauſe not fit to be truſted with their Liberty. Oh brave Engliſhmen! You have fought your ſelvs
into a brave Condition.</p>
            <div type="conclusion">
               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>YOu Officers and Souldiers of the Army that have any Reaſon, or Honorable thoughts in your Breaſt, ſhake of this deteſtable
Yoak, do not ſubmit to it, for your Poſterity will curſe you; and abhorr the thoughts and memory of You, if You ſhould
be deluded into the ſe Snares.</p>
