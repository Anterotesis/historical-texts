         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THERE were two things that influenc'd me in this Dedication: the firſt, that this little <hi>Treatiſe</hi> might have the Honour of venturing abroad into the World, under the Protection of ſome Guardian <hi>Name:</hi> the other,
<pb facs="tcp:40840:3"/>
that I my ſelf might have an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of gaining Acquaintance with a Perſon, whom I have long ſince Admired and Reſpected.</p>
            <p>The many Uſeful and Learned <hi>Books,</hi> you have generouſly bleſt the World with, have eſtabliſh'd to you a juſt and everlaſting Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: eſpecially that excellent <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,</hi> call'd, <hi>The Way to Long Life, Health and Happineſs,</hi> which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, at the very firſt Reading, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a double Victory; at once ſubdu'd my Reaſon, and engag'd my Affections.</p>
            <p>Upon this account, SIR, it is, that I have aſſum'd the Confidence of placing you at the Front of the enſuing Diſcourſes, not to Intitle you to the Patronage of my Defects and Imperfections; but to Defend and Secure <hi>what</hi> ſhall appear Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, Uſeful and Honeſt, againſt

               <p>Kind Reader, altho' I have preſented a New <hi>Speculum Mundi,</hi> never publiſh'd to the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which are my Sentiments and Thoughts; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I find, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ever had the knowledge of the Creation of the World.</p>
               <p>I have now delineated to your Eyes, the firſt Form thereof, how every thing ſprung out of the Abyſs, when the Word was given; how Light and Darkneſs were ſeparated into Forms, by the great <hi>Spygarick</hi> Powers, aſcended out the Spiritual Powers of the Abyſs, and formed the Canopy of the Heavens;
<pb facs="tcp:40840:6"/>
and from the innate Heats within, ſprung forth the glorious Lights, <hi>viz. Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I queſtion not, but that I may have many croak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Frogs of <hi>Egypt,</hi> lifting up their Tongues and Pens againſt me, or this my Opinion; tho' indeed, it may be endleſs, and ſenſeleſs too. Not that I would go about to deny, but that ſome fault may be found, and properly to be attributed to my ſelf, for want of Skill and Capacity, in reference to this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>And without doubt, Reader, you may be deſirous to be directed in the true way, to find out the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Creation. But in fine, I have another way of directing you to the true Method, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſeek to him who is called <hi>Theos,</hi> for your Knowledge and Underſtanding; for by him all things were made.</p>

               <head>Concerning the Human Eggs of Generation.</head>
               <p>There are many Authors have ſpoken ſomething of the Eggs of Women, as is too copious here for me to nominate; giving you as it were, a hint or a glance of this great Work of Generation, but have hitherto left you in Darkneſs, and have not given you the plain Demonſtration thereof: But here, I have produced to your view, the whole VVork in a large Figure, inſomuch that it will make it very eaſy to your Underſtanding, or to Reaſon it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The whole VVork being laid down ſo plain; firſt, you may ſee the Rude, or Oviary Lump, having many ſmall things, like the Spawn of a Hering, which
<pb facs="tcp:40840:7"/>
are called Eggs; the Seed or Sperm of Man being caſt on them, breaks them, or we may ſay, ſeparates one from the other, and falls into a <hi>Cavea,</hi> that Nature hath provided, as this Instrument of mine directs you; wherein may be ſeen the Growth or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thereof, every three VVeeks, or Month; firſt, in the Form of Benes, before Fleſh is; then in the ſecond Figure, you will ſee an Increaſe of Fleſh, and how it comes to Perfection. The Birth of Man is alſo wonderful to be conſidered; for firſt, he was in his Mothers VVomb before he was this <hi>Embryo,</hi> or <hi>Poelus;</hi> whether three Bubbles, or ſome rude and indigeſted Lumps, or a Conception, according to ſome Writers.</p>
               <p>As for Example, a Man was firſt a Boy, becauſe from a Boy he grew up to be a Man; before he was a Boy, he was in Infant, and before an Infant, an <hi>Embryo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame way by which we gain an Art, by the very ſame we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> any kind of Science or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whatſoever: for as Art is a Habit, whoſe Object is ſomething to be done; ſo Science is a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, whoſe Object is ſomething to be known: and as the former proceedeth from the imitation of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſo this latter from the Knowledge of things Natural.</p>
               <p>By the VVords of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> it evidently appears, by what Order the Knowledge of any Art or Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is a tained; namely, by ſenſe there remains an Impreſſion of the thing perceived; by that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is made a remembrance of it, and from multiplyed Memory, proceeds Experience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:40840:7"/>
Theſe then may ſatisfie, that by Diligence and Induſtry, a Man may arrive to a conſiderable pitch of Knowledge of the Human Eggs of Generation, or the Birth of Mankind.</p>
               <p>Give me leave therefore, to whiſper this to thee, (friendly Reader,) that thou be ſure to weigh all that I have delivered in this Exhortation, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Generation of Living Creatures, in the ſteady Scale of Experience, and give no longer cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to it, than thou perceiveſt it to be ſecurely bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed on the faithful Teſtimony of thy own Eyes: this very thing did <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> adviſe us to; for ſo far only is Reaſon to be relyed upon, as thoſe things which are demonſtrated, agree with thoſe things which are perceived by Senſe.</p>
               <p>Now to remove all prejudice that may accrue to me, Reader, I have not called this the abſolute Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my own, becauſe I had ſome footſteps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it by former Authors, as <hi>Hieronymus, Fab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioius ab Aquapendente,</hi> &amp;c. and alſo many late Authors have hinted, or propoſed ſuch things, as Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men having Eggs, but was never yet ſo plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to the meaneſt Capacity, as this my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument will explain it at large.</p>

               <head>Concerning the Lott of Man, in his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Life.</head>
               <p>To you that are wiſe and diſcreet, few words may ſuffice; for ſuch a one judges not at the firſt, nor reproves by hear-ſay, but patiently hears, and thereby increaſes in Underſtanding; which
<pb facs="tcp:40840:8"/>
Patience brings forth Experience, whereby true Judgment is directed.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not need therefore, to make any further ſuit to you, but entreat you to read the Third and Fourth Part of my Book, without prejudice; and having obtained this at your hands, I ſubmit my ſelf unto your Cenſure; hoping that you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Method of the whole Book, <hi>viz. 1.</hi> Of God, and the Creation. 2. Of Man's Creation; and then after Man is come into the VVorld, it's natural to all, to be inquiſitive about future Events, or their Lotts or Chances in this Elementary Life, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are born for Great, Mean, an Small For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>I have preſented to thee, pure and undeſiled Rules, far beyond the Rules of Aſtrology in many things, and far eaſier and pleaſanter to your Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, formerly lying a long time in Darkneſs, and under a ſcandalous Name or Title, called <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy</hi> and <hi>Magick,</hi> &amp;c. by the common and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar People, who take the ſence of the VVords a wrong way. So do many condemn the things, that they do not underſtand.</p>
               <p>But becauſe of the ſtupidity of moſt of this preſent Age, I will unfold to you this dreadful VVord. Obſerve, <hi>Magick</hi> it ſelf, which the Antients did ſo divinely contemplate, is ſcandalized, with hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Noyſe of all Diabolical Sorceries; which Art (ſaith <hi>Mirandula,) Pauci Intelligunt, multi Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendunt; &amp; ſicut Canes, ignotos ſemper al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrant.</hi> Few underſtand, many reprehend; and as Doggs, bark at thoſe they know not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:40840:8"/>
Many there are that abhor the very Name and VVord <hi>Magus,</hi> or <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who being indede not <hi>Magus,</hi> but <hi>Gos, viz.</hi> familiar with evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, uſurped that <hi>Title.</hi> But <hi>Magick</hi> and <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft</hi> are far different Sciences: where <hi>Pliny</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorantly ſcoffed thereat; for <hi>Nero</hi> (ſaith <hi>Pliny, lib. 30. Nat. Hiſt.)</hi> who had the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Magicians</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> ſent him by <hi>Tiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> who held that Kingdom by him, found out the Art, after a long Study and Labour, which I now call Lotts.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Witchcraft</hi> and <hi>Sorcery,</hi> are quite contra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry, being the VVorks of the Devil.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Magus</hi> is expreſſed, ſuch a one as is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in the Service of God, his Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi> affirms, that the Art of <hi>Magick</hi> is the Art of VVorſhipping God, as when the VViſe Men came to Worſhip Chriſt; and this is the firſt Kind, which is called <hi>Divine Magick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Latins</hi> did entitle them <hi>Sapientes,</hi> or Wiſe Men. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> call them <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers. Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Egyptians</hi> were termed <hi>Prieſts. Fifthly,</hi> The <hi>Hebrews</hi> termed them <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baliſts, Prophets, Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> The <hi>Babylonians,</hi> they were called by the Name of <hi>Caldeans. Seventhly,</hi> By the <hi>Perſians, Magicians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Word <hi>Magus,</hi> of it ſelf, imports a Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of Divine and Heavenly Sciences. But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Name, are all unlawful Arts comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as <hi>Negromancy</hi> and <hi>Witchcraft;</hi> and all for want of its true Name or Title, <hi>viz. Malefici</hi> or
<pb facs="tcp:40840:9"/>
                  <hi>Venefici,</hi> Sorcery, or Poyſoners. Theſe are the true Names of <hi>Witchcraft</hi> or <hi>Sorcery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing it's ſo, that <hi>Magick</hi> is a Divine Science, pray Reader, let me go under the ſame Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the ſecond Kind of <hi>Magick</hi> is <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> or theſe my <hi>Lotts,</hi> being nothing but Signs and Planets, and no Conjuration in it, according to the vulgar Saying, but a pure undefiled Science, which judges of the Events of things to come, Natural and Human, by the Motions and Influences of the Stars, upon theſe lower Elements, by them obſerv'd and underſtood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> affirms, that by this Part of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi> or <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> together with the Motions of the Stars, and other Heavenly Bodies, <hi>Abraham</hi> found out the Knowledge of the true God, while he liv'd in <hi>Chaldea: qui contemplatione crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turarum, cognovit Creatorem,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Damaſcen,)</hi> who knew the Creator by the Contemplation of the Creature. <hi>Joſephus</hi> reported of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he inſtructed the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in <hi>Arithmetick</hi> and <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> who before <hi>Abraham</hi> came to them, underſtood none of theſe Sciences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham ſanctitate &amp; ſapientia omnium prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiſſimus primum Caldaeos, deinde Phoenices, demum Aegyptios Sacerdotes, Aſtrologia &amp; Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina docuerit. Abraham</hi> the wiſeſt and holieſt of Men, did firſt teach the <hi>Caldeans;</hi> then the <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians;</hi> and laſtly, the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſts, <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> and <hi>Divine Knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Without doubt, <hi>Hermes Triſmegiſtus,</hi> that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Magician, who (as ſome ſay,) lived long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:40840:9"/>
                  <hi>Noah</hi> attained to much Divine Knowledge of the Creator, thro' the Study of <hi>Magick</hi> and <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> as his Writings teſtifie to this day.</p>
               <p>The third Kind of <hi>Magick</hi> contains the whole Philoſophy of Nature, which brings to light the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Virtues, and extracts them out out of the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Boſom of Nature, to human uſe; according to the Chymical Method of theſe ſorts in Old Time, was, <hi>Albertus Arnoldus de Villa Nova, Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, Bacon,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>I muſt expect ſome Calumnies and Obtrectations againſt this way of Writing, from the malicious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Man, and the lazy Affecters of Ignorance, with which this Age ſwarms; but I incite the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a charitable Opinion thereof, with a Chriſtian Proteſtation of an innocent Purpoſe therein; for the thing it ſelf is harmleſs, as a Lott or Lotts. You read of in the Scripture, the Lott fell on <hi>Jonah,</hi> and they caſt Lotts for the Garment of our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So I do intreat the Reader to follow the adviſe of <hi>Fabius, Qui litigant, ſint ambo in conſpectu tuo nocens &amp; reus;</hi> if there be any Scandal in this Work of mine, it's taken, and not given: And this comfort I have, in that <hi>Axiom</hi> of <hi>Triſmegiſtus, Qui pius eſt, ſumme Philoſophatur.</hi> Therefore I preſent it without Diſguſt, to all of candor and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency.</p>
               <p>There are four ſorts of Readers.

It's not to be thought on, that he which made the whole Univerſe by a Word, could want reſt from his Labour. St. <hi>Jerome</hi> and <hi>Maſius</hi> were the greateſt Interpreters of the Bible; and 'twas never found in the Pentateuch of the Bible, that God did ever dictate to <hi>Moſes</hi> the Creation of the World, but the Ten Commandments. <hi>God created Man in his own Image, Male and Female:</hi> At that time <hi>Eve</hi> was not made, nor no News of

               <p>THE Explanation of this Philoſophical Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the 7 Properties or Qualities of Nature, which are called 7 Spirits or Forms, and are vulgarly called 7 Planets, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 ♄, 2 ♃, 3 ♂, 4 ☉, 5 ♀, 6 ☿, 7 and laſt, <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>.</p>
               <p>You muſt obſerve, that the Sun is placed in the midſt of them all, and from him proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both Light and Darkneſs, as ſhall be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated: for the ☉ is the Centre and Heart of the ſix Planets, and alſo the only Centre of the whole Earth, that is, the Light of this World.</p>
               <p>For a further enlightning of your Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, conſider the Qualities of thoſe afore-mentioned 7 Spirits: Firſt of ♄, with his harſh,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40840:30"/>
ſtrong, and attractive Coldneſs, which ſhuts up the Abyſs, and make Darkneſs in the Deep, and attracteth the ſubſtantiality of the outward Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of this Quality; and the Centre winds about like a Wheel, and that which is oppoſite to the Wheel is the Moon: as you may plainly ſee <hi>Saturn</hi> higheſt, and the <hi>Moon</hi> loweſt; ſo <figure/> ♄ the firſt Quality, is the deſire, which make Harſhneſs, Sharpneſs, Cold, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and in the beginning of this World, Salt, Scones and Bones; ſo all this was produced out of this Sharpneſs. I find, <hi>Saturnine</hi> Men have great Bones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which ariſeth from the firſt, and is the drawing Motion in the Hardneſs or Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ♄ makes hard, and ♃ ſoftens it again, or breaks it; and there is a continual ſtriving in its ſelf, and it cuts aſunder the attractive quality and deſire of ♄, and brings it into multiplicity and variety; it's a ground of the bitter Pain, and alſo the true Root of Life, and the Strike of Fire.</p>
               <p>But there is a great Underſtanding in the Power; yet the Power cannot of his own might, awaken the Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>But ♃ deſireth a Freedom or Life in the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and that is, about the Wheel of ☿, thus; and is a ſtirring, and making a noiſe and <figure/> ſounding, and yet has not Life; for that conſiſteth in Fire. This we may take into conſideration, That the Deſire is the ground of ſomething, ſo that ſomething may come out of nothing; and this Deſire has been, and was the beginning of the World; by which, God by his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40840:30"/>
Power, hath brought all things to a Subſiſtance and Being, for the Deſire, by which he ſaid, <hi>Let there be, &amp;c.</hi> and the Deſire hath made ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing where nothing was, but only a Spirit or the Word, which is God; and he hath made a ſpiritual and viſibile Subſtantiality: We may ſee by the Elements, Stars, and other Creatures, the firſt Subſtantiality was the Heavens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mars</hi> is the third Quality; ſeeing it is ſo, that ♃ and ☿ excelleth in the Fire, therefore it deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the firſt Moving, which ſtrikes up the Fire, which is ♂, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is a Stirrer, and a Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Fire, <hi>viz.</hi> a feelingneſs of the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the harſh Hardneſs, and the ground of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, <hi>viz.</hi> a Flaſh or Lightning, wherein the Power, Colours and Virtues, do appear in theſe three firſt Qualities or Properties, and in it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the Ground of Anger, Hell and Darkneſs.</p>
               <p>But now obſerve, that this Quality of Heat and Fire it ſelf, cannot conſiſt; for Fire deſires Subſtantiality; and Fire hath no Subſtantiality; for Fire its ſelf ſubſiſteth not without Fuel to work upon; which Subſtantiality deſires Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is <hi>Venus,</hi> and is Light or Love, that are about the Wheel.</p>
               <p>For it's the Meekneſs of the outward Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <figure/> and it's that which the other before deſire, and that is Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Venus</hi> hath, and is the Fire of Love, and the World of Power and Light, wherein Darkneſs dwells in its ſelf, and the Darkneſs comprehendeth it not.</p>
               <p>Theſe 6 Properties are together, <hi>viz.</hi> ♄ <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, ♃ ☿, ♂ ♀. So theſe Six are united into three ſubſtantial Qualities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:40840:31"/>
The ☉, which is in the midſt of the 6 Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, is the Heart and Centre of them all, and is the ſpiritual Fire, wherein the Will of God, or Unity is made. You read in the Scripture, that God placed his Tabernacle in the Sun: all comes from this Unity, which hath incorporated and united its ſelf with the natural Deſire: for the burning Properties of Heat, proceed from the ſharp Devouringneſs of the firſt Qualities, as follows: The Unity or Freedom, is the ſoft and ſtill Tranquility, being amiable, and as a ſoft comfort, eaſy; and it cannot be expreſſed, how ſoft a Tranquility there is without Nature, in the Unity and Freedom of God. But the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Qualities, in order to Nature, are ſharp, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and terrible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all is produced by the Power and Word of God.</p>

                  <p>Thus I have given you by Figures, the whole Generation, both Bone and Fleſh, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Deſection of the Infant.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt turn back a little again, to the Boney-Part, becauſe I juſt now call to mind the Sayings of ſome Philoſophers, touching this ſame Subject concerning Bones, derived from Scripture, That <hi>Eve</hi> was made out of a Bone or Rib; becauſe the Central Spirit has its reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Bones, they being the firſt Product or Out-Birth of the ſaid Spirits.</p>

hence, That the Bones are the firſt material Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which we may call <hi>Semen;</hi> from which the Fleſh, as from a Spring or Fountain, doth continually proceed, and to which it muſt by Revolution, return again, in order to Perfection?</p>

                     </gap> weighing of all this, we may conclude, that <hi>Eve</hi> was made out of the very Centre of the whole Body of Man.</p>
                  <p>Now many may ſay, Is the Egg of a Woman in the Form of a Hens Egg? We ſay, No; but a Reſemblance. But the main Reaſon here, that I preſent you with an Egg in the Form of a Hens Egg, is, becauſe of that famous Author <hi>Fabricius,</hi> who ſaith, That the Contemplation of the Forming of the <hi>Foetus</hi> out of Eggs, is the largeſt of all; which appears in this, That the greateſt part of Animals are gotten of Eggs.</p>
                  <p>It's a plain caſe therefore, that all Animals whatſoever, even Vipers alſo, nay, Man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, are made of an Egg: and that the firſt Conception of all living Creatures which bring forth Young, are certain Eggs; juſt as the firſt Conception of all Plants, are certain Seeds: but what is common, is not admired. Obſerve, put the ſmalleſt Seed in its own <hi>Matrix,</hi> or <hi>Mother-Earth,</hi> and it ſprings up, and brings forth its own kind.</p>
                  <p>But O Man! thy place of Conception or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, is on thy Lump of Female Eggs. Caſt thy Eye on the Figure of the Egg, and thou wilt ſee in the middle, a parcel of rude Lumps or Spots, as it were in the form of the Female <hi>Rowe</hi> of a <hi>Herring,</hi> which is the true reſemblance of the Lump of Eggs in Women.</p>
                  <p>The true method of Conception, is thus: That when the Seed of Man is ſpilt on this rude
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40840:46"/>
Lump, or Eggs in Women, it waſheth off, or moves thoſe little Eggs, one from the other: and as Nature has provided, it falls into a ſmall Cavity, or place by it ſelf; the place being open when the Egg falls off, but when it's in, it clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth up again. Thus Nature has its Effects; and in this place, the <hi>Foetus</hi> grows to perfection, and it's compoſed round with a Covering, like the Shell of a Hens Egg; the Midwife commonly calls it the After-Birth, when it comes into the World.</p>
                  <p>Further, look again on the Figure of the Egg, and you will ſee the Elements round it, <hi>viz.</hi> the 7 Properties of Nature, with the four Triple States, <hi>viz.</hi> Fire, Air, Earth, Water; alſo you have Signs wherein the ſeven Planets or Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Nature delight in: then you have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Nature of them. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ♀ F, which ſignifies that <hi>Venus</hi> is a Female; and then concerning ♂, has the Letter M, which tells you that ♂ is Maſculine; and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>So the <hi>Matrix,</hi> or the Ovary Lump and the and the Seed of Man, are all Elements, and under the Power of the 7 Properties.</p>
                  <p>Be wiſe, O Reader! and learn the Nature of the Heavenly Bodies, and thou ſhalt do Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, without Conjuration. If thou want'ſt an Heir or Man-Child to inherit thy Land, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a time when the <hi>Maſculine</hi> Planets and Signs Aſcend, and in full Power and Force, then take thy Female, and caſt in thy Seed, and thou ſhalt have a Man-Child.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:40840:47"/>
Obſerve the ſame method with the Female Signs and Planets, for a Daughter, and ſo on.</p>
                  <p>It's not my buſineſs here to meddle or ſpeak of the Nouriſhment of the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb, or the Birth, becauſe my Task is Elementary.</p>
                  <p>But if you pleaſe to read my <hi>Compendium Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomicum,</hi> you will have a brief Account of the <hi>Oval</hi> Nouriſhment, and Birth of a Child, from the Conception to the Birth; <hi>Fabricius</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his <hi>Oviary</hi> or Hens Eggs, Dr. <hi>Gibſon</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Eggs of Rabbets, Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> concerning Brutes or Animals.</p>
                  <p>An Egg is the common Original of all Animals. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf calls the very ſame things Worms in one place, and Eggs in another.</p>
                  <p>But it is needleſs to make uſe of his Reaſons in this place, to prove it; ſeeing we are already convinced, that all Animals have their Original from theſe Eggs; and by the Experiments of our later Authors in this Particular, it's plain, that Man (tho' chief) was ingendred in, or by them.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve the ſame by Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> Dr. <hi>Gibſon, &amp;c.</hi> they give us an Example of the Eggs of Women by the Rabbets, by diſſecting them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Conception, and at Conception; and ſo by degrees, to perfection. But my main buſineſs is, to ſhew how the <hi>Foetus</hi> is governed in the Womb, by the Elementary Power: I will give you the Opinion of <hi>Henricus Lindhout, Bruxel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenſi Medicinae Doctore; ac Philoſophorum.</hi>

               <p>So much for the Creation of the great, and and little Worlds.</p>
               <p>But to go gradually along as I have begun, I ought to ſpeak ſomething of the Nature of Man, <hi>De Natura Hominis;</hi> but I find it's a large Field, inſomuch that I ſhall forbear, and make it a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it ſelf, which will be ready for the Preſs very ſpeedily.</p>
               <p>Seeing Man by Nature is prone to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and of a lofty Mind, and apt to dive into Knowledge and ſecret Myſteries; it might be very proper in this place, to give you a word or two, as an Introduction to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my preſent Task in Hand, <hi>viz.</hi> We have obſerved in this our Elementary Life, many certain and true Rules, by which we have foretold Events to come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the Canopy of Heaven and Stars, according to their Situation.</p>

               <p>So I am not willing here to trouble my ſelf about any Vindication of this great Work, but direct you to that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Heydon</hi>'s Vindication of Aſtrology, which may be to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>But for your further ſatisfaction, I have in the following Chapter, begun from the beginning, by the firſt Man <hi>Adam,</hi> down to this Day, very ſhort and brief; ſhewing you, firſt, that <hi>Adam</hi> was the firſt Man that took notice of the Elements, Power and Signification of the Seven Properties of Nature.</p>
               <p>You may ſee in the next Chapter, how they of Old did obſerve the Seven Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Nature, in obſerving the ill Nature of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and the good Nature of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> becauſe he was Author of Goodneſs; the old <hi>Hebrews</hi> called ſome of their Children by that Name <hi>Jupiter; Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>'s Wife called her Son <hi>Gad,</hi> which is <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> becauſe he is to give a good brisk ſhare of Body, and a good Principle; this was obſerved in old time, proved by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:40840:50"/>
In the third place, we have taken notice of Eleven Particulars, where we find by general Obſervations, the Changes and Turnings in this Box of Elements, of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and Deſtruction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then fourthly, We prove to you, that the Starry Heavens are Books, and they are to be rolled together, in which you may read your future Hope and Fortune in the World; thereby ſhewing you alſo, that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and others, read the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens in their own Language, making up their Letters by the motion of the Stars.</p>
               <p>So the main reaſon, why I thus trouble my ſelf about the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and Old Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is only to convince the Ignorant what the Truth is.</p>
               <p>Many there be that will not believe, that they are under the Power of the Canopies of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Alas! our Saviour Chriſt himſelf, was (as Man) under the Juriſdiction of the Elements: ſo your Bodies muſt be under ſubjection of thoſe Powers.</p>
               <p>But if you deſire to know how to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Elements in your Mind, Will, and Underſtanding, ſtrive to be as <hi>Saul</hi> when he ſought his Fathers Aſſes, <hi>Sam.</hi>

               <p>This is prov'd by <hi>Joſephus,</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Seth</hi> were the firſt that practiſed this Science, or Power of the Elements; and that <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he fled into <hi>Egypt,</hi> taught it the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> this Truth hath ſo much the more force in it, in that it proceedeth from a Man whoſe Authority is unqueſtionable; ſo that we may perceive, that <hi>Pliny</hi> was much miſtaken, when he affirmed, that none but <hi>Atlas</hi> was the Author of it: Beſides, we are very certain, that Aſtrology was in uſe long before <hi>Atlas.</hi> Some ſay, that <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now if it be demanded, why do we not then any where elſe, meet with the like Example? <hi>Jacob Ben Samuel</hi> anſwered, That this was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved chiefly, by reaſon of the Jealouſy that was between the two Siſters <hi>Leah</hi> and <hi>Rachel, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>'s Wives; for <hi>Leah</hi> ſeeing that her Siſter had two Children already, which made her ſo proud, that ſhe began to boaſt, <hi>Comparavit me Deus cum ſorore mea:</hi> fearing, leſt that after ſhe ſhould have given over Child-bearing, her Siſter would have the upper-hand of her, and that ſhe ſhould be no longer beloved of her Husband; ſhe gave her Maid unto him, and cauſed him to go in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her; and as ſoon as ſhe perceived her to be with Child, ſhe obſerved ſo well the time of her

               <p>Theſe are the Aſtrological Obſervations of theſe Patriarchs, and which were Holy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, in that they wrought in theſe good Men a continual Admiration of the Works of God.</p>
               <p>But thoſe that came after them, mixed Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition with this Aſtrology of their Forefathers; it came in a ſhort time to be corrupted, and to loſe its firſt Purity.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We are come now to take notice of the Canopy of Heaven, and the Elements, for our Obſervation, or Knowledge of Things to come. Here is a queſtion; Whether it's poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to read any things in the Clouds, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Meteors? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Many ways; firſt, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be underſtood by Viſible Signs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in Letters, Characters, Marks, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, Staves, Torches, Darts, Javelins, Knots, Streaks, Colours, Holes, Points, living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or any other ſenſible thing. Now all thoſe Figures or Signs may be repreſented in the Clouds three manner of ways; firſt, By Letters, or known Characters; ſecondly, By Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks; and laſtly, By Signs and Marks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The moſt intelligible Signs, Marks, or Characters, that are Figured in the Clouds, are Armed Men, Battels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which appear in order for many Days together, and do give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to Man of ſome ſenſible Event to come, and that to the great aſtoniſhment of all thoſe Men that would reduce all things to the Principles of Philoſophy. Twenty-four Years before the Birth of our Saviour Chriſt, there were two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſeen to encounter each the other in the Air, miraculous to be ſeen: the running of their Horſes, the voice of Men, and the claſhing of their Armour. Soon after was this Viſion made known to the World: for <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla,</hi> by their Factions, making as it were a Shambles of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40840:53"/>
the Field, were the cauſe of ſo much Bloodſhed <hi>(Joſeph. de Bel. Jud. l. 7. c.</hi> 12.) The <hi>Romans</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver received a greater Blow.</p>
               <p>Many ſuch Inſtances we may ſpeak of ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> home, but I am afraid my Book will ſwell too big</p>
               <p>The Philoſopher gives us theſe Verſes to the ſame effect:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Qui elles ſe forment, en cet diverſe portraicts dont,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Les ventes, les transforment</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>En Centaurs, Serpens, Hommes, oyſe aux poiſſons,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Et d'une forme, en autre errent en cent Faſons.</hi> 
                  </l>
               </q>
               <p>Engliſhed thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>How into ſeveral Forms themſelves they throw,</l>
                  <l>Which Winds change into Shapes of things below;</l>
                  <l>Birds, Fiſhes, Serpents, <hi>Centaures,</hi> Men, and thus</l>
                  <l>Shift, in a round of Figures various.</l>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Obſervation of Knowledge is from the Air, the Clouds being a Repreſentation of things here below, and conſequently purely natural, and are formed by the Providence of God. Of this latter Kind, are thoſe ſpoken of by the Author of the Hiſtory of the <hi>Maeccabees,</hi> where <hi>Judas</hi> fighting in Heavens Quarrel, had an Apparition ſent him, of five Horſemen appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the Air, which purſued his Enemies ſtrongly, that above 20000 fell on the place;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40840:53"/>
beſides, this Prodigy happened alſo in a clear day, when the Air was not darkned with Clouds. So, I may be of the opinion with <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> and <hi>Pomponatus;</hi> that oftentimes, we may ſee in the Air or Cloud, as in a Looking-glaſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Now we come to that of Rain, wherein we can make no other uſe of Reading, but by Hieroglyphicks; and of this kind is the Raining of Blood, or Water of the Colour of Blood, ſuch as fell in <hi>Switzerland, Anno</hi> 1534. which fell upon Peoples Cloaths in the form of Croſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Picus Mirandula</hi> hath given a large Copy of Verſes; among which, you have the Story of a wonderful Deliverance, as followeth:</p>
               <q>

                  <p>Now let the World judge, and ſpeak as they find; in the Year 1682, I then publiſhed a Book, Entituled, <hi>Speculum Mundi,</hi> in which are now to be ſeen, the very Actions of theſe great Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions. It being then my chief intention, to diſcover to the World, thoſe great things Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence was probably likely to bring to paſs, from the Influences of the Meeting of the two great and ſuperiour Beings, the two Rulers of the World, <hi>viz.</hi> ♄ and ♃, and likewiſe from the great Eclipſes of the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, in <hi>Anno</hi> 1684, ſuch an Eclipſe hath not been theſe hundred Years, and at that preſent time ſo many Planets in the Houſe of Religion.

                  <p>So in pag. 4. I delivered my Judgment, that

here would be great Alterations in moſt parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> of Laws, Cuſtoms, Conſtitutions of People in Matters of Religion, and Changing of Kings and Kingly Government.</p>
                  <p>And is not this all true! Were not the Popiſh Principles the root or cauſe of theſe Mutations and Changes? And did not a Prince come from <hi>Holland</hi> with a handful of Men comparatively, to that brave Army of K. <hi>James</hi>'s? And when this handful of Men came towards them, they all fled as the Chaff before the Wind; and to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, K. <hi>James</hi> himſelf fled to <hi>France,</hi> when none perſwaded him from his three Kingdoms; and then (ſoon after) the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was Crowned King of <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>O that ſuch things ſhould be done without a drop of Bloodſhed! Surely Reader, this is from the Powers above; and the Powers above gave us a foreſight of it by the Rulers ♄ and ♃.</p>
                  <p>This hath been ſo admirable, that our <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> have taken notice of in their Book, in ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Queſtion, Whether a ſmall irrational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as a Spider, had not a Heart?

                  <hi>Illud verò</hi> (ſaith he, ſpeaking of this <hi>Meduſa's</hi> Head,) <hi>nunc Apuliae &amp; Neapolitanorum Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no eſt verticale, moxque Italiam invadet; quibus ſuam quoque cladem allaturum eſſe, maximopere eſt verendum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now how long before-hand, theſe Celeſtial Letters do fore-ſhew the Changes that are to happen, you are to take notice of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Letters before-mentioned.</p>
               <p>In the next place, the method how to be able to underſtand this Celeſtial Writing; we muſt learn to know the true Stars, as Oriental, Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental, Meridional, and Septentrional; the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Heavens are very eſſential in this way of Reading: For if we deſire to know the good Fortune and Proſperity of a Kingdom, or any other Affair, we muſt read thoſe Letters which are vertical to it, or which want not much of being ſo, from the <hi>Weſt</hi> towards the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> and if you would be informed of the ill Fortune, look out, and read from the <hi>North</hi> towards the <hi>Weſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the way of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Rules laid down; ſome certain Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of this Celeſtial Writing, which are ſpoken of by <hi>R. Rapol, Chomer</hi> and <hi>Abindan,</hi> which are
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40840:60"/>
the Three which have moſt written on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. I have before ſhewn you, how the Stars of the Conſtellation, called <hi>Caput Algol,</hi> being ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical to <hi>Greece,</hi> did foreſhew the Deſtruction of it. The like is to be obſerved in the reſt of the Stars, when they are vertical to any other Kingdom; tho' they are ordered, and are to be underſtood otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Some time before the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was burnt and conſumed by <hi>Nabuzaradan,</hi> it was obſerved, that Eleven of the Stars that were the moſt vertical to it, compoſed for a conſiderable time together, theſe five Letters:
<figure/>
and being joined together, makes up this word, (reading it from the <hi>North</hi> to the <hi>Weſt) Hicks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chich,</hi> which ſignifies to reject and forſake, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Mercy, and the number of Three of them added together, comes to 423, which is the ſpace of time that this ſtately piece of Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had ſtood.</p>
               <p>Alſo, before the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaw their Scepter caſt down to the ground, and their Liberty carried Captive unto <hi>Babylon,</hi> five Stars were for a long time together, obſerved to compoſe theſe three Myſtical Letters:
<figure/>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:40840:61"/>
a word, which ſignifies to break, caſt down, and to drive out; and the number of the Letters, which is 505, was the number of years that the Jewiſh Kingdoms had ſtood, from <hi>Saul</hi> to King <hi>Zedechias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Perſians</hi> or <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> who were the ruine of the Monarchy of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſaw the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of their own Empire; after that, four of the Vertical Stars had compoſed theſe 3 Letters,
<figure/>
which makes up the Number 208, which was the time of the Duration of this Monarchy, which was founded by <hi>Cyrus.</hi> At the end of which, the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire was likewiſe fore-ſhewn by four Stars, which made
<figure/>
up the Verb <hi>Parad,</hi> which ſignifies to divide; and that in this wonderful manner, as that the very ſame Letters did produce the number of years that the Monarchy laſted, and took his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at that time that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great ſubdued the laſt <hi>Durius: R. Chomer</hi> ſays, that this Celeſtial Writing, hath pointed out the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining of two great Empires of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> one is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40840:61"/>
that of the <hi>Turk,</hi> which was obſerved ſeven Vertical Stars, which being read from the <hi>Weſt</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> makes up this Word:
<figure/>
which ſignifies to be Battered, Feeble, Languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and drawing to an End.</p>
               <p>Many more ſuch-like Examples we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Reader with, concerning this Celeſtial Writing, but this may give an inſight of the method and way of reading the Will of God in that Heavenly Book, which is ſaid to be at the laſt Day rolled together as a Roll of Parchment.</p>
               <p>But if theſe few Examples are not ſufficient for your Underſtanding, pray read my Authors, <hi>Ropol, Chomer</hi> and <hi>Abindan;</hi> there you will find it expreſſed, that it's not every one that can read theſe <hi>Hebrew</hi> Letters, or Celeſtial Writing, but whom God is pleaſed to give that Gift of Reading; as, none but <hi>Daniel,</hi> who was a juſt Man, none but he could interpret thoſe Viſions.</p>
               <p>Remember ſtill, that the Elementary Life of Man is very Changeable and Tranſitory; it's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for all Men to be inquiſitive after future Changes and Alterations during their Lives, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it's as a Bubble, or as a Snip toſſing up and down by the Waves of the Sea.</p>

Providentia eſt rerum procuratio, à Deo ſuſcepta.

Thy Lott and thy Providencs are in general, all things that thou canſt enjoy in this Elementary Life; and God is the Fountain and Free-giver, and gives thee Rules and Underſtanding to know them.</p>
               <p>This is <hi>inter nos,</hi> amongſt us, or our ſelves; to know whether the Lott will be good or ill, is my preſent Task in this Chapter: but before we go on, a word or two concerning the word LOTT; it has two ſignifications, it is firſt counted a ſquare Thing, as a Dye, or other thing caſt into a Pitcher or Pot, thence to be drawn out again, to end Strife or Difference.</p>
               <p>This is not our meaning: But to take our Lott from him who made all things, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 26. not that the Event of a Lott comes from Stars, Fortune-tellers, Devils or Saints, but from God only, whoſe priviledge is, to order the Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them.

This is the Way and Method of Raiſing your Lotts, which are 16 in all, and cannot be more, and by thoſe well underſtood, you may ſee how Tranſitory your Elementary Life is: But to be more plain, we will make uſe of theſe Lotts in the manner and form as the Aſtrologer doth, <hi>viz.</hi> in 12 Diviſions of the Heavens or Earth, which you pleaſe to call it, and the two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and Judges in the Model. Behold the Figure on the other ſide.</p>
               <p>Thus, after you have raiſed your Lotts of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, you may eaſily transform them in this manner as you ſee, <hi>viz.</hi> into Signs and Planets united, as you have in the foregoing Tables, or as in this Figure, where you have the true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and Form of all your Lotts in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Names; for we have caſt off all the ſtrange and hard Characters and Names of the <hi>Arabians, Hebrews, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> becauſe you ſhould not be frightned thereby, or of the Word <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy</hi> or <hi>Conjuration, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>IN this Chapter, you will be ſhewn the great Strength, Ability, Force and Power of thoſe 16 Lotts, and how the Divine Spirits are infuſed into the 16 Figures, by the Seven Properties of Nature, by the Power of him which made the World, and how the Planets and Spirits are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into the Figures.</p>
               <p>All inferior Bodies are exemplified by the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Powers or Spirits, which are above our Bodies, Minds or Souls.</p>
               <p>They place themſelves very intelligibly in the Soul of the World, differing the one from the other by abſolute Forms; ſo that all Power in God, is but one Form; but in the Soul of the World, they are many: they are placed in the midſt of all things; whether they be joined to the Body, or ſeparated from the Body; by a certain Participation they are placed in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as certain ſmall Seeds of Forms, are infuſed by the Power above.</p>

                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:40840:76"/>
They are placed alſo in thoſe 16 Figures; whereon the Shapes and Properties of Virtues of inferiour Species, as alſo their Properties do depend; ſo that every diſtinct Lott or Figure, hath its Power that is ſuitable to its Form: which alſo proves a wonderful Power, according to the Diſpoſition of things, good or ill; for all theſe Influences, theſe Figures may be received, and may alſo be hindred by the indiſpoſition of the Matter, or according to the Perſon, or his Quality: ſuch is the ſignification of the Lotts, which receive Virtue and Power from above: Thus the Seven Properties and their Powers are incorporated into theſe 16 Lotts, and are the cauſe of the Virtue of the Figures, of their Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, of their Product, and all things paſt, preſent, and to come.</p>
               <p>In the next place, thoſe that intend to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Lotts aright, muſt know their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. By which, you may ſee from whence all things come, whence Mankind and Beaſts; whence Fire, Rain, Snow and Earthquakes are; the great Sea-beats over her Banks, and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain returns; whence the Power and Strength of Herbs, Courage and Rage of Brutes, all kind of Stones, and all ſorts of Worms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Now in erecting your Lotts, in the main there are but 12 Figures, tho' 15 makes up a Figure; for Three are taken from them, <hi>viz.</hi> two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and one Judge.</p>
                  <p>The ſignification of the two Witneſſes are thus:</p>
                  <p>The Witneſs placed at the right hand, is put for the Querent, and rules all the right ſide, as, 2, 3, 4, 9 and 10; it gives you light what the Queſtion is, before propouided.</p>
                  <p>The left Witneſs, contains all what the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures ſignifies in that ſide, as 5, 6, 7, 8, 11 &amp; 12.</p>
                  <p>The right Witneſs tells you of Joy, Pleaſure and Happineſs, of him that asks the Queſtion of things paſt.</p>
                  <p>The left Witneſs tells you of ill luck to come, or things enquired after, if ill Figures; if good judge otherwiſe; right for the Querent, and left for the things deſired, and belongs to no Houſe; only taken from others, to give a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on things demanded.</p>
                  <p>The Judge is the 15th Figure produced from the two Witneſſes, to judge of the end of things demanded, and to know, if it's good or bad. Some ſay, that the Judge ought to be even; if not, give not judgment on it.</p>
                  <p>If the Judge be good, the Queſtion will come to a good end; if ill, the contrary. If the Judge agrees with the right hand Figures, good to the Querent, and things demanded; if it's the ſame with thoſe of the left hand, it ſignifies ill to the Querent of the matter deſired.</p>
                  <p>

So vary your Judgment accordingly.</p>
               <p>Again, If the ſecond Houſe or Lott, go into the third, thy Brethren will rule over thy Goods; the fourth, thy Father; fifth, thy Children, or the Alehouſe; and ſo of the reſt, according to the Rules of all the other.</p>
               <p>If the Queſtion be, Shall I ſee or ſpeak with my Brother? If thy Lott is found in the third Houſe, it's a true teſtimony that thou ſhalt ſpeak with thy Brother; and ſo on.</p>

                  <head>Concerning good Company.</head>
                  <p>Good Company is to be much deſired, and ill Company is to be abhorred; it's good Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that brings many to Happineſs, and ill, which brings many to the Gallows.</p>
                  <p>Now we have a method in theſe our Lotts, to know our Company, or our Aſſociates and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. Obſerve this Rule; the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and the ſecond Houſe, are Companions; and ſo obſerve in order, the ſecond and third Houſe, the third and fourth Houſe, the fourth and fifth, the fifth and ſixth, the ſixth and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, the ſeventh and eighth, the eighth and ninth, the ninth and tenth, the tenth and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth; and laſtly, the eleventh and twelfth Houſes. Thus they are united together in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                  <p>You are now to conſider the Natures and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of thoſe Lotts by the foreſaid Tables; and if you find a Lott in the ſecond Houſe of an ill principle, you may be then fearful of being drawn away, or trapan'd, and perſwaded to an ill thing: if the Lotts are both good, fear not, for good may be thy Fortune. Then again, if thou find'ſt a watery Lott in the firſt Houſe, a fiery Lott in the ſecond Houſe, then you may ſay, the Company is not good; and by this Method, you may judge right of your Society in general: ſo, if they are of one Nature, and of one Triplicity, you may believe, you are upon a ſure ground, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>It's a certain Truth for Children, if the firſt go into the 5th, or the 7th into the 11th h.</p>
                  <p>If you find Watry Lotts in the 5th houſe, there's generally Miſcarriage.</p>

                  <p>There are many which expect News, Letters, or Meſſengers.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Houſe and Lott, to him that ſent the Meſſenger; the 7th, and his Lott, is him to whom the Letter is ſent; the 5th, the Meſſenger, and his Deciſion.</p>
                  <p>If the 5th Houſe is beheld by good Lotts or Aſpects, the Meſſenger does his Buſineſs with Credit.</p>
                  <p>If the 5th Lott go into the 2d, the Queſited brings Money with him; if the Lotts are ill, then it may beſpeak the Letter-Carrier to be Drunk by the way, or ſome ill.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place, if you intend to go to Play at any Game, ſee if the Lott of the 1ſt. Houſe goes into the 5th, or the 7th moves into the 2d.</p>

Now if you are willing to know, what Trade or Profeſſion to take in hand; you muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der well the Rulers of thy Lotts on the 10th h. of what Triplicity they are, whether Fire, Air, Earth or Water; if Fire, a Trade of a hot nature; if Water, thou ſhalt gain by the Sea or Water, or by Wine, Ale or Beer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>If ♄ Ruler of the 10th h. and if thy Birth ſprung from a low Deſcent, give thy mind to Dig in the Ground for Money, Husbandry or Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or Tillage of the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But if thou deſcend from high Birth, thou mayſt be a Judge, and gain Money by ſleeping or waking, and come to a degree of great Power.</p>
                  <p>♃ ſignifies dealing in Cloth; and pulling off the Wool of Sheeps back by night, if ♃ is ill or retrograde; otherwiſe, a good Shop-keeper, and will come be a Church-warden of a Troop of Horſe.</p>
                  <p>♂ Ruler of the 10th h. and retrograde, a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker will be thy beſt Trade; but if ♂ is ſtrong and powerful, take thy Sword by thy ſide, and ſtrive to be a Captain.</p>

                  <p>THis 12th Houſe is relating to Compters and Impriſonment; and in this we have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally an Eye to the firſt Houſe: If we find a good Lott, and free from Evil there, then we may ſay, the Querent is ſtrong and powerful, and ſoon out of Priſon; but if weak and ill, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: if it goes into the third Houſe or 9th, he will be ſoon releaſed.</p>

Now if you are deſirous to know the Unity and Place of the Lotts, by way of Aſpects or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, behold the Table: ♄ is the Example, throughout the 12 Signs or Lotts.</p>
               <p>See ♄, or the Lott <hi>Acquiſitio;</hi> he beholds the third Houſe by a ⚹ Aſpect, a <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> to the Fourth Houſe, a <g ref="char:trine">△</g> to the 5th, and a ☍ to the 7th <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>We may very well diſcern by this, what Evil is pointed out againſt this Querent of ours.</p>
               <p>Obſerve the Lott that is in the 4th Houſe, which is of an ill nature, caſting his ill Beams to the Aſcendant; the Lott is called <hi>Carcer,</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> a Priſon, or a diſmal Place; which is no way agreeing with the Lott in the Aſcendant: therefore I conclude, that this Gentleman and Old People cannot agree; and beſides that, there will be an Old Man which lyes ſtill in the Graſs, like a Snake, to do him a private Miſchief; and the more certain, becauſe the 7th Houſe is poſſeſſed with an ill Lott, as alſo the Lott in the 12th h. His ſecret Enemies, and his open Enemies, noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious by nature; we may well conjecture, that there is a notorious Plot contriving againſt this Man, ariſing from Enmity and Malice; and that he will be brought before Judges or Juſtices of the Peace, or ſuch ſort of Perſons.</p>

               <p>Then again, another Inquiry may be made, <hi>viz.</hi> To know what Company this our Querent had, or did keep; becauſe it's a common Saying, and I believe it's true, <hi>Bad or ill Company brings ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the Gallows:</hi> And in <hi>pag.</hi> 150. you have the Rules, to know good or ill Company.</p>
               <p>Now note, that the ſecond h. is Company for the firſt.</p>
               <p>As for Example, we have in the Aſcendant, the Lott <hi>Acquiſitio,</hi> a very good Lott; and in the ſecond h. his Company was <hi>Triſtitia, viz.</hi> ♄ retr. in ♏, ſignifies a curſed Pack, not fit for the Society of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>I conclude then, this was or would be, the Foundation and Ground of this Man's Trouble; then finding this, I could not be quiet, before I had ſpoke with him, to know the truth of the Matter: And then he told me plainly, That he had formerly lodg'd in his Houſe, PORNE, <hi>&amp; Homo ſceleſtus,</hi> about three years paſt, and that he put them out of his Houſe by violence.</p>
               <p>Now it plainly appears, if you conſider my former Rules, and alſo this my preſent Judgment, that thoſe are the Ground from whence ſprings this Wickedneſs againſt this our Querent; for behold, ♄ is Lord over the Lott in his ſecond h. which is his bad Company, thinking to gain Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,

becauſe of the ſecond h. Behold again, ♄ is Lord or Ruler over the Lott of the 4th h. too; they would willingly handle ſome of our Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent's unmoveable Goods And more than all this, obſerve, ♄ is alſo Rul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>So I conſider'd my Rules, and found, that this Trouble would fall on this Man in about a Months time; and ſo it was, a Month and three Days after the Viſion or Dream; and at that time the two forementioned Perſons went to a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Peace, and ſwore this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ours had robb'd Money, and that he kept com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with Clippers and Coiners: ſo his Houſe was ſearched, and they found nothing; but he was apprehended, and carried before ſuch Perſons as before-mentioned, and was there Examined: And as for his Freedom or Deliverance, you ſhall have it at large in the next Chapter.</p>
               <p>But Reader, this is no new thing now in our Days; for it's very frequent, that ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a double dye in Knavery, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge to gratify their own Will, to make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>wear Treaſon againſt a Man, fallly and maliciouſly.</p>
               <p>But in this particular, I will open to you the Way and Method, to know the Nature of a Dream or Viſion, or the word <hi>Somnium;</hi> it's no more, but an Obſervation drawn from the 9th h. which is the Houſe of our Querent's Spiritual Guide, which did reveal to him this Trouble, Shame and Diſgrace, a Month before it came.</p>
               <p>Now we will take a view of our great Work, and we may find, that on the 9th Houſe, is that Lott called <hi>Rubeus;</hi> which is of a bloody, and harſh nature, inſomuch that our former Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſaid, If that Figure <hi>Rubeus</hi> ariſeth in your Figure, let it be (ſay they) depopulated, or deſtroyed. Now I am of the contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; for as long as we live under the Elements, we muſt expect ill, as well as good.</p>
               <p>The Aſtrologers do not deſtroy their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, when they find the ☋ in the Aſcendant, or elſewhere; for they obſerve ſome Knavery forth coming thereby, to themſelves, or to the Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:40840:153"/>
Neither do I adviſe you, when you find the Lott <hi>Rubeus,</hi> or ill Lotts, to caſt it aſide; but obſerve the Nature and Qualities thereof.</p>
               <p>As for Example, <hi>Rubeus</hi> is in the 9th; turn back to the main Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Lotts in the 9th h. and you will find what that Lott <hi>Rubeus</hi> is; what it ſignifies in the 12th Houſe: in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Houſe, he differs ſomething. But in the main, it's a Lott of a deſtructive Nature, and of a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery Triplicity; but many Writers compare it to both Fire and Water, upon extreams, having no mercy.</p>
               <p>And very like unto this Nature, was the Viſion of our Querent, <hi>viz.</hi> Burning and Conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming by Fire or Water, or both, in a moſt frightful and terrible manner.</p>
               <p>And this is my Opinion and Judgment, on the Viſion of this Gentleman.</p>
               <p>Now I went to him, and laid down this my Judgment concerning the Viſion; and he told me, it was very true: for Fire and Water, with Deſtruction, was the ground-work of his fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Dream.</p>
               <p>Then I deſired this our Querent, to reveal to me the whole Matter.</p>

                  <p>A Brief Account of the Delivery, Friendſhip, and Support of this Querent, under ſo great a Scandal and Diſgrace; drawn from this Angelical Work of Ours.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. IN the firſt place, obſerve, that we have here two Witneſſes and one Judge; and firſt, we will ſpeak of the two Witneſſes: the Right Witneſs is called <hi>Laetitia,</hi> a Lott, in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> ſignifying Joy and Gladneſs. Now this Right Witneſs is always taken for the Querent, and ſignifies his Concern, either good or ill; and to be more larger, it hath alſo an inſpection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the Houſes, on that ſide; that is to ſay, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10; it diſcovers what the Motion of the Querent is, before propounded. And this I muſt tell you, is a good Teſtimony of the Gentleman's Integrity and Honeſty.</p>
               <p>And in this I am more plain, becauſe I would inſtruct young Students.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As for the Left Witneſs, it bears Teſtimony, of the Mind and Intention of your Enemies, and as a Landskip of the other Heuſes in that ſide, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:40840:154"/>
The Lott, which is the Left Witneſs, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Rubeus,</hi> a Lott of a deſperate bloody-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another Teſtimony of our Querent's ſpeedy Delivery, is, by that Lott which we call the Judge, <hi>viz.</hi> ☉ retr. in ♉. Obſerve here, Rules of truth, taken from the <hi>Caldeans</hi> and the <hi>Roſie-Crucian-</hi>men; When the Judge moves himſelf into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt, it's an abſolute Teſtimony, that the Judge of the Law will do Juſtice. This happens to our Querent; if you look back to our great Work, you will plainly ſee it: and the Judge freed this our Priſoner, and the Clerks alſo of the Law, cry'd out ſhame on this PORNE, <hi>&amp; Homo ſceleſtus;</hi> and ſaid, they ought to be hang'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It's a ſtrong Argument of Recovery, from the Lott in the Aſcendant, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ♃ dir. in ♈; you have its Deſcription at large, in <hi>pag.</hi> 151. ſignifying a Man of Power, and one that lives in Pomp and Credit in the World; and ſuch a one generally cruſheth the Power and Malice of poor inconſiderable Earth-worms, that ſhew their Teeth, and are not able to bite: ſo you have often heard, that <hi>Populus</hi> ſignifies ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Enemies. It's a common Saying, that when a Man lives well, and gets Money, he is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hated by ſome, becauſe they think he lives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:40840:155"/>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Now the reaſon of Redemption, is, becauſe, if you mind the great Work, you will find, the Lott in the Aſcendant moves it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the third Houſe; a true token or teſtimony, of this Querent to have many true and faithful Friends, or Neighbours we may call them: and as now I ſay, ſo it was; for he had many of the beſt of the Pariſh in which he lived; the Church-warden for one, to be Surety or Security for him, on occaſion.</p>
               <p>Then behold the Table of Aſpects, and you will find an Aſpect of Love, between the Lott in the Aſcendant, and the third houſe, which ſtrengthens the foreſaid Arguments.</p>
               <p>Then again, <hi>Sixthly,</hi> you will find Friends, from the 11th houſe; <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the Lott there is ♀ dir. in ♎, a pure good Lott, of Truth and Stability; and this is the more verified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are Aſpects of Love between the Lott of the Aſcendant and the 11th houſe, the houſe of Friendſhip: and this Gentleman infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med me, that he had, at that time of Trouble, two Eminent Doctors of Phyſick came willingly and freely, proffering their Service to him; they were both of great Eminence and Renown: their Deſcription of Body and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, is exactly repreſented, according to our former Rules.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> If you deſire to know, if the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent was long in Cuſtody, or in Priſon, look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the 12th h. the houſe of Impriſonment, and you will find, that the Lott called <hi>Via,</hi> ſignifies the Way, and is a ſure Teſtimony; pray turn
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:40840:155"/>
back to <hi>Via</hi> in the 12th houſe: it poſitively ſays, a ſpeedy delivery out of Priſon; and ſo it was to admiration, (ſays the Querent) conſidering the nature of the thing.</p>
               <p>Reader, the truth of this our Angelical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, or by way of Lotts, ought to be much eſteemed by the Lovers of Art; for my Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this, have been very large.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The death of our Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent's ſecret Enemies, <hi>Homo ſceleſtus</hi> died in the Boſom of PORNE, our Enemy: and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if you conſider, that the 8th h. of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, the Counſel or Company to the Querent's Enemies, is moved into the 12th h. of ſecret Enemies, and is called <hi>Via,</hi> and is in ☍ to his 8th, a terrible Lott, <hi>viz.</hi> ♄ retr. in ♏, called <hi>Triſtitia;</hi> and this in one Month from the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and PORNE ſubmitted her ſelf to the mercy of the Querent.</p>

               <p>NOW behold the great Work, and you will find, the Figure of Aſtrology is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

in the inner 12 Houſes, which was Erected at the very inſtant of this our Querent's firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending, being <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. at 10 in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon; at that time, this Gentleman was ſeized on by a parcel of <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Caterpillers; but conſidering what they were, they were, indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent civil.</p>
               <p>It's a common Rule for the Aſtrologers, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Aſcendant firſt; and if you do, you will find there the Tail of the Dragon, which beſpeaks ſuch a parcel of Fellows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now ♎ aſcends the Horoſcope, and the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> was in ☍ to to <hi>Venus, ad</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are to conſider the 7th Houſe; and there we find the Sign ♏, which very well reſembles the Lott <hi>Populus,</hi> as I have before ſpoken of: for the 7th houſe is our Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent's open Enemies, and the 12th h. is his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ones: So we may plainly ſee, that the Planet ♂ is Lord of the 7th. h. poſited in the 12th houſe; a plain Teſtimony, that our Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent hath malicious and bitter enemies to deal with; and the more, becauſe ☿ is in the 12th Houſe alſo, which ſignifies a malicious, lying, prating Tongue; for ☿ naturally ſignifies Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, Diſſemblers, and forſworn, perjur'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in the Sign ♓, becauſe he is in ☍ to his own Houſe: the Querent hath good reaſon to fear envious Fools, forſworn Perſons, thinking to get Money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We muſt now begin to take notice of the ☍ of ♀, Lady of the Aſcendant to the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, layes down the ſame reaſon as the Lotts did;
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:40840:156"/>
the main Inſtrument was <hi>Porne,</hi> and ♋ in the 4th h. ſome old Knaves of the Acquaintance of the Querent's ſpur her on in the Wickedneſs; and the more, if you take notice of her 11th h. being the Houſe of Advice; and not only ſo, but ♃ retr. in the 6th h. The Deſcription of this PORNE, is one of an indifferent high and long Neck, a cloudy Complexion, a dark Hair, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Melancholy, Penſive, apt to Cry or Weep, and much given to Drowſineſs, Heavy-headed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet ſomething covetous, or ſaving of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, performing no good Action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We plainly ſee the Death and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of our Querent's ſecret Enemies, if we obſerve the Rulers of Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> to take notice of the 12th Houſe. Now we find ♂ in the 12th h. or Lord of the 12th, of the Enemies, in his Aſcendant; and not only ſo, but ♃ retr. in ☍, and the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> too; a poſitive Sign of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Homo ſceleſtus;</hi> and indeed, he dy'd in the Boſom of PORNE: And according to the beſt Information I had, he was deſtroy'd by the Diſeaſe cauſed by the Planet ♂. The time of the Death of <hi>Homo ſceleſtus,</hi> was about five Weeks after our Querent's Viſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> A word or two concerning our Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent's Friends, who would have Aſſiſted him. They are exactly repreſented by ♄, and the ☉, in the 11th Houſe, which beſpeak Men of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Stature, full and plump; and ſo they were, and Perſons of good Quality and Reputation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Another Obſervation we have taken for his Delivery, is the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> to a Trine of ♄,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:40840:157"/>
and ♀ and ♄ to a ⚹. Now to demonſtrate this to you, obſerve thus, that ♄ is Lord of our Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent's 10th Houſe, in ⚹ to ♀, Lady of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant; a pure Truth: the Judge was his Friend, and many more; perceiving it was a piece of Villany, to get Money.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut this Querent was taken up, and carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord Mayor of <hi>London:</hi> and upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, the Mother and Daughter (in not having a good Memory, as Liars ought to have) betray'd themſelves in telling their Stories, and were puniſhed, according to their Deſerts.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman proved himſelf to live in one place as a Shopkeeper for 15 years, and many friends to teſtifie of his Truth and Fidelity.</p>
               <p>Now this Querent came to me with a very heavy Heart, fearing his utter Ruine: but I bade him not fear, for it would come to nothing. I being ſomething intimate with him, he told me, he was for ſome time in <hi>Oxford;</hi> and I found him to be ingenious in many things: He knew ſomething of Aſtrology, and ſaid, that he had the ☋ in his Aſcendant; which many may believe, or think, that he was a Man of a tardy Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; but he was not, for I made enquiry; ſo I told him: and it's my Opinion, that tho' a Man may have the Dragons Tail in his Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, it doth not infuſe Knavery into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:40840:158"/>
but ſtores up many falſe, baſe and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemies, againſt his Body and Purſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> A certain Gentleman came to me, deſiring me to Raiſe his Lotts for him, to know if he ſhould ſpeak with his Common Dealer, (if he went to his Houſe, being ſeven Miles;) he was willing to be certain before he went.</p>
               <p>I follow'd my Method of my Angelical Work, and <hi>Acquiſitio</hi> was raiſed in the Aſcendant, and moveth it ſelf into the 7th Houſe, which is the Houſe of Dealing. I bade him go ſpeedily, and he ſhould ſee him, and ſpeak with him; and ſo he did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A certain Woman came to me, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring me to tell her where her Horſe was, for ſhe could not find him: I raiſed my Lotts, and found the Lott of the 12th Houſe, which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd the Horſe; and finding this ſame Lott mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf into the 4th Houſe of the Querent, I bade the Woman go home, for the Horſe was in her own Ground, in ſome Corner, or watery Ditch; for the Lott was of the watery Tripli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. And accordingly the Woman went home, and found her Horſe, as I told her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A Man of my Acquaintance, gave his Wife leave to go to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> ſome diſtance from <hi>London;</hi> expecting her home at night, but ſhe did not come; inſomuch that the Man cani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> was become of his Wife; he was fearful le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> ſome ill had happen'd to him.</p>
               <p>I examin'd her Lott, <hi>viz.</hi> in the 7th Houſe and found it to be <hi>Amiſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and moved it ſelf to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:40840:158"/>
a ⚹ of the 11th Houſe, which is the 5th from the 7th. I told the Man, that his Wife was making him a Cuckold, and that all that Night ſhe lay with a tall, black Man. The Man ſeem'd to be angry with me; but in four days time, he was well ſatisfied in the Matter, for his Wife gave him a damn'd ſwinging Clap. In <hi>pag.</hi> 181. you will find, that <hi>Amiſſio</hi> in the 7th Houſe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a Whore; and being in ⚹ to her 5th, you may well judge what ſhe was about, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> A certain Man came to me, very mournfully; for he had given his Wife ſome ſharp Words, upon which ſhe went away from him, he knew not where.</p>
               <p>I raiſed his Lotts, and guided my Eyes to the 7th Houſe, and finding that Lott was moved into the 9th Houſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the third from the 7th. I deſired this Man to go to his Wives Siſter, and there he ſhould find his Wife: and he found it very true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> A certain Woman came to me, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me, that ſhe had loſt or miſſed her Husband for two days; deſiring me to tell her what was become of him.</p>
               <p>I found that <hi>Via,</hi> the Lott in the Aſcendant, was moved into the 12th Houſe: I ſaid to the Woman, thy Husband is in Priſon, but will ſoon be freed, and ſet at liberty. She went ſpeedily from me, to the <hi>Marſhalſea</hi> in <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>park,</hi> and met her Husband at the Priſon Gate, coming out, being juſt releas'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> A Gentlewoman came to me, with a dreadful noiſe, to know if her Husband would
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:40840:159"/>
die, for he lay very ill. Women generally make a noiſe in ſuch a caſe, whether they love their Husbands or no. But in ſhort, I Rais'd her Lotts, and found a good Lott in the Aſcendant, <hi>viz. Albus,</hi> and mov'd it it ſelf into the 10th h. I bade the Gentlewoman be contented; for in ſix hours, or in a ſmall time, her Husband will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Recover. And true it was; for this Rule I have of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>en Examin'd, and ſound it never fail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> If the Queſtion be to know, If the Sick Perſon ſhall Recover?</p>
               <p>I go on in this manner: Firſt, I find a good Lott in the Aſcendant, as <hi>Albus;</hi> I ſay, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſhall Recover: in the 2d. h. is <hi>Carcer,</hi> no good Habit of Body; in the Third h. is <hi>Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitio,</hi> ſignifies a good Iſſue; the Fourth h. is <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus,</hi> a long Sickneſs; the Fifth h. is <hi>Rubeus,</hi> tells you, that all things the Patient takes, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the inward Parts; the Sixth h. is <hi>Albus,</hi> ſhews the Diſeaſe it ſelf, to be of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and Oppreſſion of the Heart; the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth h. is <hi>Laetitia,</hi> and his Company is <hi>Cauda Draconis,</hi> the Elements of Air and Fire, telling you the Party is dangerouſly ill, and ſignifies Death, becauſe of the 7th and 8th h. the Ninth houſe is <hi>Amiſſio,</hi> and is a plain demonſtration, that the Perſon, or Miniſter of the Pariſh, will have no Gain; the 10th is <hi>Acquiſitio,</hi> which gives hope of Life and Recovery, the 11th is <hi>Conjunctio,</hi> and ſignifies, that his Friends believe his Diſeaſe is mortal, and are out of hopes; and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Conjunctio</hi> be alſo in the 12th, it tells you plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that his Enemies are in great hopes of his Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:40840:159"/>
                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> This is a true way of judging, if you obſerve the Lotts and their Natures, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Differences of Elements. And while it's freſh in mind, I will give you a true Method of Judging the ☍, <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>, ☌, ⚹ and <g ref="char:trine">△</g> Aſpects.</p>
               <p>Now for a further Demonſtration of the Aſpects, worth your Obſervation.</p>
               <p>An Example of the Aſpect of Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt beholds the 7th, which is an ill Aſpect, as well for the diſtance of the Place, as for the contrariety; becauſe the firſt is Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and the ſeventh Occidental.</p>
               <p>And the like is from the 4th to the 10th, not only ☍ by place, but the 4th h. is Darkneſs, and the 10th h. is Light. Now here lyes the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: If you find a good Lott in the firſt, and ſo in the 7th, and of one Nature, Planet, and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the things demanded, will come to a good end; and the Place of ☍ is only to ſignifie, that Matters of Things between them, are ſtrange, and unacquainted: but Friendſhip will ſoon come, if you find <hi>Fortuna Major</hi> in the firſt h. and in the 7th too, you may well conclude of Unity, Peace and Tranquility: but if contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the afore-mentioned, judge otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>And in like manner, conſider the <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g> Aſpect, and alſo the <g ref="char:trine">△</g> and ⚹; altlio' thoſe are count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good in Aſtrology, yet in thoſe Lotts we muſt conſider the Nature, Quality and Elements; and if we find a good and bad, by a <g ref="char:trine">△</g> Aſpect, we may conclude, that their Friendſhip appears outwardly by a flattering Tongue, but Enmity lyes at the Heart.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Rules to know, what any Perſon comes to thee for, before he declares his Buſineſs.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis is of great moment, if you underſtand it aright, <hi>viz.</hi> to underſtand the Minds of People.</p>
               <p>The firſt Rule, how to know the Intent; is to ſee when the firſt Houſe or Lott goeth into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the other, and judge according to the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the Houſes wherein he or ſhe goeth: if the Second h. Money, third h. Brethren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Rule, is to take all the uneven Points of all the 12 Lotts, and give one to the firſt, and another to the ſecond, and third; and ſo conſequently to the other, until that all the Points are beſtowed; then if the Points remain on the firſt h. it ſignifies thereby, that the Perſon hath a deſire to know ſomething of the Queſtions belonging to the firſt houſe: if it reſteth on the ſecond h. Money, or Moveable Goods, as you have been formerly ſhewn. So you may judge of all the other Houſes, where the Points or Pricks ſtay.</p>
               <p>Not long ſince, I had a certain Midwife came to me; ſhe ask'd me, What ſhe was come
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:40840:160"/>
to me for? I deſir'd her to ſit down a while, and I ſhould tell her. I Rais'd my Lotts, and found, that <hi>Rubeus</hi> was in the Aſcendant, and moved it ſelf into the ſeventh h. I preſently told her, ſhe was come to me about a wicked Husband, having to do with more Women than he ought; and I conſider'd the Nature of the Lott <hi>Rubeus,</hi> and concluded within my ſelf, that the Midwife was as right as her Husband. But in ſhort, ſhe told me, that I hit right on the matter; for her Husband was a very wicked Man, (ſaid ſhe) for he keeps Whores; and I hear, he is Married again, ſays ſhe; but I am quit of him, and have not liv'd with him a long time; and I am Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd again, and he is at Sea, but no body knows it. I ſpoke a pertinent Word, and ſaid, <hi>I had the knowledge of that before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now her Queſtion was to know of me, When her firſt Husband would die, and the ſecond come home from Sea.</p>
               <p>Kind Reader, I will ſhew you one Example more, as a new Method in Raiſing theſe Our Angelical Lotts, and ſo ſhall conclude: For I proteſt to you, That I have found more Truth in this Angelical Art, than in Aſtrology; and then again, it's a Method far more eaſie, and pleaſanter than Aſtrolygy.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="7" type="chapter">
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:40840:161"/>
               <head>Another Way of Raiſing theſe Angelical Lotts, Much on the Aſtrological Method.</head>
               <p>THIS Method indeed, I have not follow'd, becauſe I have found ſo much Truth in the forementioned. But to ſatisfie the Curioſity of the Reader, I will lay down the Rules.</p>
               <p>Obſerve therefore, to make four unequal Lines, as is taught in my former Lotts, by the Points caſually ſet down; and to join together theſe Points: And out of theſe Points which are not joined together, and which do remain in the Head of the Lines, extract one Figure; and the Sign of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> that anſwereth to that Figure, put for the Aſcendant.</p>
               <p>An Example may be proper; if <hi>Acquiſitio</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the Head of thoſe four LInes, let ♈ be placed in the Aſcendant: but if <hi>Laetitia,</hi> or the Leſſer Fortune, put ♉ in the Aſcendant: if <hi>Puer,</hi> or <hi>Rubous,</hi> place ♊: if <hi>Albus,</hi> ♋: if <hi>Via,</hi> ♌: if <hi>Conjunctio,</hi> or the Drag. Head, ♍: if <hi>Puella,</hi> ♎: if <hi>Amiſſio</hi> or <hi>Triſtitia,</hi> ♏: if <hi>Drag Tail,</hi> ♐: if <hi>Populus,</hi> ♑: if <hi>Fortuna Major,</hi> ♒
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:40840:161"/>
if <hi>Carcer,</hi> then put ♓ for the Aſcendant. So place them in order in their Houſes, as ♈ in the firſt, ♉ in the ſecond, ♊ in the ſecond h. as you ſee in the Figure following, not regarding the Witneſs or Judge.</p>
               <figure>
                  <p>The ſame Method, if another Lott is Raiſed; put it in the Aſcendant, and the reſt in order.</p>
               </figure>
               <p>So, out of 16 Figures, you make uſe but of 12, which anſwers to the 12 Signs of the <hi>Zodiack;</hi> and this may ſerve for your purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And as for placing into thoſe 12 Signs, the Seven Properties of Nature, obſerve to make four Lines by courſe, for every Planet by Points, caſually pricking, or pricked down; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for the <hi>Drag. Head,</hi> as you have done for the Aſcendant, and divide thoſe Points by 12,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:40840:162"/>
and that which remaineth above 12, or the 12 it ſelf, if a greater number doth not remain, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and the Planet for which the Projection was made, place in that Houſe of which the ſuperabounding number ſhall be; that is, if there remains 12, let the Planets be placed in the 12th houſe; if ten, in the 10th; if one, in the firſt h. if two, in the ſecond h. and ſo of the reſt: And you ought always to begin from the ☉, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards from the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g>, then from ♀ and ☿, and from ♄, ♃ and ♂.</p>
               <p>But it's the advice of our Fore-fathers, not to make a Queſtion in Rain, Clouds, or a very Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Seaſon, or when thou art Angry; not but that you may take your time for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe again, as you have heard in my former Rules.</p>
               <p>And as for this Method of Raiſing your Lotts, you may, according to this Rule, place your Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, (as you ſee in the Figure;) and that may ſerve for your Example.</p>
               <p>Then for your Judgment, turn to <hi>pag.</hi> 151, to 210. which tells you of all the Power and Strength of all the Houſes: As for Example, if your Queſtion be of the 7th houſe, ſee what Lott there is; if for a Brother, conſider the Lott on the third houſe; and ſo of the reſt, and you will find an Anſwer to your deſire.</p>
               <p>Then obſerve how pure and eaſie it is, to that which we call Aſtrology, is ſo tranſcendent and ſubtil an Art in it ſelf, that therein a Man ought to have a reſpect to many things, before he can obtain a true Judgment, becauſe the Eye of our Underſtanding will not pierce into the half
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:40840:162"/>
thereof; and many there be that pretend to it, and know nothing thereof, becauſe their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is weak: for he that made all things, gives not to all Men alike.</p>
               <p>Again, kind Reader, notwithſtanding I have roved thro' the two great Bodies, of that we call in Philoſophy, <hi>Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſmus</hi> and <hi>Microcoſmus,</hi> you ſhall find me diſtinct from all you, that pin your ſelves upon Points of Religion; for it's baſe, and an abſurd thing, that thoſe who are ſo ſeemingly united together, ſhould ſo barbarouſly exclaim one againſt the other, not minding the Scripture; when he that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you all, hath not given you Gifts alike; ſome for Teachers, and others for Evangeliſts.</p>
               <p>I have not, in all my Works, exclaimed againſt weak Judgments, nor extolled the Wiſe; but I retain it in my Breſt, and keep it to my ſelf, conſidering, that Man is the little World; and every Man acts within himſelf, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers his Sentiments, as his Spirit gives him leave. But of this no more; only I muſt tell you my Opinion, that this Angelical Art is pure and undefiled: if you are willing to enquire, come without Fraud or Deceit, and you may have your Deſire anſwered by the Powers above; if you are afflicted, come in a right Method: for it's the Powers above that guides thy Hand, and gives thee thy <hi>A B C,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It was <hi>Abraham</hi> that found out the only true God, by his wonderful Works, <hi>viz.</hi> in obſerving the Motions of the whole Creation. You that are counted Atheiſts or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, may be brought to true Faith, and the ſooner, if you obſerve the wonderful Works of God: then you will lay aſide caviling about ſilly Words, or Things of no value, between you, that are ſo near united together; and the Will of God may be found out by the Wiſe and Prudent, and by his Rules, given to us in the beginning of the World.</p>
               <p>Obſerve the Faithful of Old, how they admired the great Works of Providence, and Worſhipped God by the Power of his Works. <hi>Adam</hi> being the firſt Man, <hi>Ergo,</hi> moſt law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and thoſe that are Unbelievers, God threatens, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 29.
