            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE To the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>OW these <hi>Sermons</hi> will be looked upon (if at all looked upon) by <hi>the Men of the Times,</hi> is no very hard matter to conjecture. I confess they are not <hi>Alamode,</hi> nor fitted to <hi>the Palate</hi> of those men, who are <hi>resolved</hi> before-hand (without tast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or tryall) to <hi>nauseate,</hi> as <hi>unsavoury</hi> and <hi>unwholsome,</hi> whatsoever shall be tendered unto them from the hand of an <hi>Episcopal Divine.</hi> And therefore <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publishing</hi> of them in this state of <hi>Church-affairs,</hi> now <hi>the things</hi> so much contended for in some of them, are worne <hi>out of date,</hi> and <hi>thrown aside,</hi> will be deemed at least a very <hi>unseasonable</hi> undertaking: to as much purpose (perhaps it will be said,) as if a man would <hi>this year</hi> reprint an Almanack for <hi>the last.</hi> For <hi>the latter part</hi> of the Objection: at the peril be it of those, that had the hardiness to adventure upon <hi>a new Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Mihi istic nec seritur, nec metitur</hi> All I had to do in the business, was but the drudgery of reviewing <hi>the old Copy,</hi> to correct <hi>the Errata</hi> of the former <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions</hi>; and of looking over <hi>the sheets</hi> as they were wrought off from <hi>the Press,</hi> and sent me down, to note <hi>the oversights</hi> escaped in the printing, and to
<pb facs="tcp:64019:3"/>
make <hi>the Index</hi> of the <hi>Scripture-quotations.</hi> As to <hi>the other part</hi> of the Crime, such as it is, to wit <hi>the unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness</hi> of this <hi>after-publication</hi>; there need not much be said. If <hi>the Sermons,</hi> thought <hi>not unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi> in some former times, be now become <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, as things brought forth into the world again, <hi>out of due time</hi>: that cannot I help. <hi>They</hi> are <hi>the same</hi> they were, when they were <hi>first preached</hi>; and <hi>the same</hi> they were, when they were <hi>last printed</hi>: and so am <note n="a" place="margin">

               <hi>I.</hi> If either <hi>they</hi> or <hi>I,</hi> find worse entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>now,</hi> then we did <hi>then</hi>; and any <hi>blame</hi> be due for that: let not <hi>us</hi> bear it, who are guiltless; but <hi>the Times.</hi> For it is <hi>They</hi> are changed: not <hi>We.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>: now they are abroad, they must take <hi>their lot,</hi> as it falleth out. Which be it <hi>better,</hi> be it <hi>worse</hi>; this yet we shall gain thereby: that if any shall <hi>charge</hi> these Papers with <hi>unseasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> (no very huge crime,) he shall <hi>ipso facto,</hi> by that very <hi>act,</hi> and <hi>the verdict</hi> of his own <hi>conscience,</hi> fully <hi>discharge,</hi> and for ever acquit them of the guilt of <hi>Time-serving</hi>; a crime, I trow, of a vaster <hi>mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude,</hi> and wherewith <hi>Discourses</hi> of this nature were wont to be so <hi>frequently,</hi> (that I say not, <hi>unjustly</hi>) aspersed, whilest <hi>the Times</hi> looked more favourably upon them.</p>
            <p n="2">§. II. But of this enough. I expect to meet with far <hi>heavier Censures</hi> then these, from <hi>the ungoverned</hi> spirits and tongues of <hi>the more zealous</hi> (that is to say, if rightly interpreted, <hi>the more clamorous,</hi> and <hi>lesse knowing</hi>) among them. Who knoweth not, that as <hi>empty vessels</hi> give <hi>the loudest sound,</hi> and <hi>shallow brooks</hi> run with <hi>a fiercer current,</hi> and make <hi>a greater noise,</hi> then <hi>deeper Rivers</hi> do: So they that are the least able to <hi>judge,</hi> are ever the most forward to <hi>pass sentence</hi>; and when they so do, the most <hi>rigid</hi> and <hi>peremptory</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. But <hi>the heaviest doom,</hi> I suppose, will proceed from those men, who being themselves of late years
<pb facs="tcp:64019:3"/>
               <hi>fallen</hi> out, grievously <hi>fallen out</hi> (for what cause I know not) with the Ancient <hi>Government, Liturgy,</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi> of the Church; are angry with all those, that retain any <hi>good opinion</hi> of them. Whereunto yet <hi>themselves,</hi> when time was, <hi>seemed to be,</hi> and if they <hi>dissembled</hi> not (which we are unwilling to believe) <hi>were indeed,</hi> reasonably <hi>well affected.</hi> For they submitted to <hi>the Government,</hi> used <hi>the Liturgy,</hi> and observed <hi>the Ceremonies</hi> appointed: according to <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Order</hi>; and their own professed <hi>approbation</hi> of the same, as well by <hi>express words</hi> from their mouths, as by <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription under their hands,</hi> yet remaining upon record <hi>What</hi> hath wrought this <hi>change</hi> in them, (Evidence of <hi>Reason,</hi> or worldly <hi>Interest,</hi>) and <hi>how farr</hi> it hath wrought upon them, (in <hi>reality,</hi> or but in <hi>complyance</hi>;) and <hi>in what order</hi> too, (by immediate assault upon their <hi>judgment,</hi> or by dealing underhand first with <hi>the affections</hi>:) themselves do, or should best know. It highly concerneth them, even as much as <hi>the peace of their consciences</hi> is worth (and much more then so) to be well <hi>assured</hi> that their <hi>hearts</hi> are <hi>upright</hi> in this affair. And in order thereunto, not to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with a slight and <hi>overly examination</hi>; (There is more <hi>wickedness</hi> and <hi>deceitfulness</hi> in <hi>the hearts</hi> of all men, then most men are aware of:) but to make the most diligent, district, and unpartial <hi>search</hi> possible, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>the true causes</hi> and <hi>motives</hi> of this change. And, for so much as <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Hopes</hi> have been ever found the fittest and the readiest <hi>Engins</hi> to work such <hi>feats</hi>;) to enquire particularly, what <hi>influence</hi> or <hi>operation,</hi> either <hi>the Fear</hi> of losing what they had, or <hi>the Hope</hi> of getting more, might have in this <hi>work,</hi> towards the producing of such an <hi>effect.</hi> It will best become <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> to judge as <hi>charitably,</hi> as they may: but doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it would be safest for <hi>them,</hi> to be very jealous over <hi>themselves,</hi> lest so great <hi>a change</hi> could not have been wrought in so short a space, without <hi>a strong infusion,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64019:4"/>
either of <hi>the one,</hi> or <hi>the other,</hi> or <hi>both,</hi> into <hi>the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine</hi> that wrought it. Especially, since <hi>the conjuncture of the time</hi> wherein this <hi>change</hi> hapned, may very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably raise some suspicion, that <hi>the Fear of the Sword</hi> might have; and the visible <hi>advantage</hi> some have found thereby since, as probably, that <hi>the Hope of gaine</hi> had, some <hi>cooperation</hi> at least, with whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was <hi>the principal Cause</hi> of this so suddain <hi>a Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosis.</hi> If nor so, nor so; but that they finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves clearly <hi>convinced</hi> in their judgments of their former <hi>Errour,</hi> and that they are fully <hi>perswaded</hi> they are now in <hi>a better way</hi> then that wherein they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly walked: it is <hi>happy</hi> for them, and I doubt not but they will finde matter of <hi>rejoycing</hi> in it, if they be not <hi>mistaken</hi> (a thing not impossible) in <hi>the triall</hi> of their own hearts. Of <hi>the sincerity</hi> whereof, the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyest way to give <hi>satisfaction</hi> to the world, and to adde some <hi>strengthening</hi> withall to their own <hi>assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> is; by shewing <hi>compassion</hi> to those their <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> that cannot yet tell how to <hi>recover</hi> themselves out of <hi>the snare</hi> of the same <hi>common Error,</hi> from which they are so happily <hi>escaped.</hi> At leastwise so far, as not to <hi>despise</hi> them; nor to pass their <hi>censures</hi> upon them, with so much <hi>freedome</hi> and <hi>severity</hi> as some have done. If it be <hi>a fault,</hi> sure it is a very <hi>pardonable</hi> one; for a man in <hi>the change of times,</hi> to remain <hi>unchanged</hi> in his <hi>minde</hi> and <hi>opinion,</hi> and to hold to his <hi>former</hi> and (as he thinketh) <hi>well-grounded Principles</hi>: so long as he can neither apprehend any <hi>Reason</hi> of sufficient strength to convince his <hi>understandings</hi> that he is <hi>in the wrong,</hi> or to manifest unto him <hi>the necessity</hi> of making such <hi>a change</hi>; nor is able with the best wit he hath, to discern any thing so <hi>lovely</hi> in the effects and <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents</hi> of such <hi>change</hi> since it was made, as might win over his <hi>affections</hi> to any tolerable liking thereof up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>the Post-fact.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">§. III. To return where I was going, and from
<pb facs="tcp:64019:4"/>
whence I have not much <hi>digressed</hi>; if any shall now aske me, what those <hi>heavy Censures</hi> are which I said we should be like to meet withall, I confess I am not able to give him any certain <hi>account</hi> thereof: not knowing before hand what <hi>reasons</hi> or <hi>expressions</hi> the spirits of particular men will suggest to their <hi>tongues</hi> or <hi>pens.</hi> Only by what hath been usually said <hi>by one sort of men</hi> upon such like occasions heretofore, (more sparingly and <hi>in the eare</hi> in former times, but of late more frequently, freely and <hi>on the house tops:</hi>) it may be probably guessed what kind of <hi>Censures</hi> are to be expected from those of <hi>the same party</hi> now. Yet for that I am not conscious to my selfe to have said any thing in <hi>the Papers now,</hi> or at any time <hi>heretofore</hi> (with my allowance) published, that may give <hi>just offence</hi> to, or merit <hi>the hard censure</hi> of, any sober dispassionate man; and that, if yet I must fall under some <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censures,</hi> it is not <hi>my case</hi> alone, but of <hi>many others</hi> also wrapt with me in <hi>the same common guilt</hi>: I shall therefore reduce my discourse herein <hi>ab hypothesi ad thesin</hi>: and propose the <hi>Objections,</hi> with my <hi>Answers</hi> thereunto (though with some reflexion upon <hi>my selfe</hi> in most of the particulars, yet) as laid against <hi>the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality</hi> of those mens <hi>Sermons, writings,</hi> and other <hi>discourses,</hi> who (according to <hi>the new style</hi> of late years taken up among us) go under the name of <hi>the Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal party,</hi> or <hi>Episcopal Divines.</hi>

                  <hi>the Authors</hi> of such <hi>Sermons</hi> and <hi>Treatises,</hi> as have come abroad in the defence of such trash, to be <hi>Popishly-affected</hi>: or at least to have been set on by some <hi>Popish Bishops</hi> or <hi>Chancellors,</hi> (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps without any such <hi>intention</hi> in themselves:) on purpose to promote <hi>the Papal interest</hi> here, and to bring back the people of this nation <hi>by degrees,</hi> if

not into <hi>the heart</hi> and within <hi>the walls of Babylon,</hi> yet at leastwise into <hi>the confines,</hi> and within <hi>the view</hi> of it. VI.

                  <hi>qualifications</hi> to sundry <hi>Doctrines</hi> taught in the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and such <hi>interpretations</hi> to sundry taught in <hi>our Church,</hi> as may bring them to the nearest <hi>agreement</hi>; and their great <hi>endeavours</hi> to finde out such <hi>Expedients,</hi> as might best bring on a perfect <hi>reconciliation</hi> between the two <hi>Churches.</hi> VII.

            <p n="6">§. VI. That which is said in <hi>the first</hi> place of their <hi>Godliness</hi> and <hi>Tenderness of Conscience,</hi> is not much to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the purpose, as to the main business. For <hi>First,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that <hi>all parties</hi> pretend to <hi>Godliness; Papists, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists,</hi> and who not (even the late-sprung-up ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of <hi>Levellers,</hi> whose <hi>Principles</hi> are so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive of all that <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Iustice</hi> by which <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick societies</hi> are supported, do yet style themselves, as by a kinde of peculiarity, <hi>The Godly</hi>;) And that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>secondly,</hi> it is the easyest thing in the world, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more common then, for men to pretend <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> when they are not minded to <hi>obey:</hi> I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>thirdly,</hi> (though I am well perswaded of <hi>the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi>

               <hi>the godliest</hi> men are <hi>men,</hi> and <hi>know but in part</hi>; and by the power of <hi>godliness</hi> in their <hi>hearts,</hi> are no more secured from the possibility of falling into <hi>Errour</hi> through <hi>Ignorance,</hi> then from the possibility of falling into Sin through <hi>Infirmity.</hi> And as for <hi>Tenderness</hi> of Conscience <hi>fifthly,</hi> a most gracious blessed fruit of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
               <hi>the holy Spirit</hi> of God, where it is <hi>really,</hi> and not <hi>in pretence</hi> only, nor <hi>mistaken,</hi> (for sure it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Needful it is therefore, that in the publick teaching <hi>the Errours</hi> should be sometimes refuted, and <hi>the Temptations</hi> discovered.

            <p n="7">§. VII. But that which pincheth most in this <hi>first particular,</hi> is (as I suppose, this: That upon all publick occasions, especially in <hi>Visitation-Sermons,</hi> they who agree with us in <hi>the substance</hi> of the same <hi>reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> are for the most part <hi>the only mark shot at</hi>; whilest <hi>the common enemy, the Papist,</hi> hath little or nothing said against him. For answer hereunto. First, so far as concerneth <hi>the Sermons</hi> here publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>the Objection</hi> is void<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for therein <hi>the Papist</hi> hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> had his share, as well as his fellows, so oft as <hi>the Text</hi> gave occasion, or <hi>the file</hi> of my discourse led me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: as by <hi>the papers</hi> themselves (whereunto refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to be had) will evidently appear. <hi>Secondly,</hi> admitting all <hi>true</hi> that is alleaged: either we are <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:64019:7"/>
in what they <hi>blame</hi> us for; or they that <hi>blame</hi> us <hi>inexcusable,</hi> who do the very <hi>same things.</hi> Do not they usually in their <hi>Sermons</hi> fall bitterly upon <hi>the Papists</hi> and <hi>Arminians?</hi> but seldome meddle with <hi>the Socinians?</hi> scarce ever name <hi>the Turks?</hi> I have been often told, of their declamations against the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of <hi>Christmas,</hi> that great <hi>superstitious</hi> thing: but I remember not to have heard of much spoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> and some other sins, wherewith our times abound. Nay, doth not their <hi>zeal</hi> even against <hi>Popery</hi> it self (<hi>Popery</hi> I mean, truly so called) of late years, and since most of <hi>the Pulpits</hi> are in their <hi>possession,</hi> seem to <hi>abate</hi>; at leastwise in comparison of <hi>the zeal</hi> they shew against <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and against <hi>the Liturgy, Festivals</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in use among us? These they cry down with all <hi>the noise</hi> they can, and with all <hi>the strength</hi> they have; having first branded them with the name of <hi>Popery</hi>: and this must now pass for <hi>preaching against Popery.</hi> I demand then. Is there not the like reason of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving <hi>Sins,</hi> and refuting <hi>Errours?</hi> If so: are not <hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>Sacriledge</hi> as great sins (at least) as <hi>keeping Christmas</hi> holy day? Howsoever, are not the Errors of <hi>the Turks,</hi> that deny the whole structure of <hi>the Christian Religion, (foundation</hi> and all,) far worse then the Errors of <hi>the Papists,</hi> who by their <hi>additional su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstructures</hi> have only altered <hi>the fabrick,</hi> but keep <hi>the foundation</hi> still? And are not the Errours of <hi>the Socinians,</hi> who deny <hi>the Trinity,</hi> Gods <hi>Omniscience,</hi> the Eternity of <hi>the Son,</hi> the Divinity of <hi>the Holy Ghost, Original sin,</hi> the calling of <hi>Ministers,</hi> and far worse then those <hi>the Arminians</hi> are charged withall, of <hi>Free Will, Vniversal Redemption, Falling from Grace,</hi> &amp;c. And are not the old rotten points of Popery (<hi>the Popes Oecumenical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pastorship and Infallibility, the Scriptures unsufficiency, Image-worship, Invocation of Saints, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation, Half-Communion,</hi> &amp;c.) Errours of as
<pb facs="tcp:64019:7"/>
great a <hi>magnitude,</hi> as those other points of <hi>Popery</hi> (lately and falsly dubb'd such) of <hi>Episcopacy, Liturgy, Festivals,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi>? If they be: why do our <hi>Brethren</hi> preach <hi>oftner,</hi> and inveigh <hi>more,</hi> against these <hi>later</hi> and <hi>lesser</hi> in comparison, then against those <hi>former</hi> and <hi>greater sins</hi> and <hi>Errours?</hi> I doubt not, but they have some <hi>Reasons</hi> wherewith to <hi>satisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> for their so doing: else they were much to blame. Be those Reasons what they will: if they will serve to <hi>excuse them,</hi> they will serve as well to <hi>justifie us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">§. VIII. It will be said perhaps; <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>the Turks</hi> have no <hi>Communion</hi> with us: They are <hi>out of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Church</hi>; and our chiefest care should be for <hi>those within,</hi> leaving <hi>those without</hi> for God to judge. Or indeed <hi>Secondly,</hi> To what purpose would it be to address our speeches to them some thousands of miles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> out of hearing? If our <hi>voyces</hi> were as loud as <hi>Sten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> or that of <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> the sound would not reach them. Besides that <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is little danger in <hi>our people</hi> of receiving <hi>hurt</hi> or <hi>infection</hi> from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
them: who have no such <hi>agents</hi> here to tamper with the people in that behalfe, no such <hi>artifices</hi> and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible <hi>pretensions</hi> whereby to work them over to their side, no such <hi>advantages</hi> as the agreement in some <hi>Common Principles</hi> might afford for bringing on the rest; as <hi>the Papists</hi> have. Who being within the pale of <hi>the visible Catholick Church,</hi> and living in the midst of us, have their <hi>instruments</hi> ready at hand in every corner to gain <hi>Proselytes</hi> for <hi>Rome</hi>; the specious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of <hi>Antiquity, Vniversality, Consent of Councels and Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. Wherewith to dazle the eyes of <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>credulous</hi> persons; and some <hi>ground</hi> also to work upon in <hi>the agreement</hi> that is between them and us in the principall Articles of <hi>the Christian Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb facs="tcp:64019:8"/>§. IX. These <hi>Reasons</hi> I confess are <hi>satisfactory,</hi> as to the Comparison between Turks and Papists: and may be applyed to the other Instance also in their proportion, so far as the Application will hold truth. And all this is agreeable, both to the Apostles dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9— 13; and to the advises of prudent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Statists,</hi> who forbear to advance against <hi>a potent Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> abroad, till they have composed smaller <hi>quarrels</hi> and <hi>mutinies</hi> at home; and To the Example also of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> our blessed Saviour himself; Who, although the Errours of the Sadduces were, in themselves and in respect of their matter, much worse then those of the Scribes and Pharisees; yet because the danger of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the people was greater from These then from Those, (the Pharisees by reason of their out-side ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness being grown into better Esteem with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then the Sadduces were; and the generality of the people also by their education pretily well Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled, and so fore-armed, against those more gross and palpable Errours of the Sadduces:) is observed therefore to have both more frequently and with greater sharpness reproved the Scribes and Pharisees for their false teaching, then he did the Sadduces; and to have given the people more caveats to beware of them and their leaven, then that of the Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p n="10">§. 10. This is the most, I think, they have to say for <hi>themselves</hi>: and, upon supposal that all <hi>the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars</hi> in the aforementioned <hi>Instances</hi> were indeed such <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Errours,</hi> as they either <hi>take</hi> or <hi>mistake</hi> them for; it must be admitted a very <hi>reasonable</hi> and <hi>sufficient</hi> plea. Only we require (which is but <hi>equal,</hi>) that they mete unto us back again with <hi>the same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>; and allow us the benefit of <hi>the same plea (muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis mutandis,)</hi> so far as <hi>our Case is the same</hi> with theirs. Let them but this do: and <hi>the Objection</hi> will vanish. <hi>First,</hi> we nothing doubt but that <hi>the Papists</hi> (by being
<pb facs="tcp:64019:8"/>
baptized into <hi>the Faith of Christ</hi>;) are in a far <hi>better condition</hi> otherwise; as we are sure they stand in a <hi>neerer relation to us</hi> thereby, then <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> do. Yet, as to <hi>external Communion</hi> in the publick Worship; by <hi>refusing</hi> to assemble with us, (which is not our fault,) they are as very strangers to us, as the very Turks are: and in that respect to be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>those that are without.</hi> And therefore we deemed it more <hi>expedient,</hi> and a more <hi>brotherly act,</hi> to endeavour the reducing of <hi>our Brethren</hi> that held communion with us to their <hi>just obedience,</hi> by disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to their faces (being personally <hi>present</hi>) those their <hi>Errors,</hi> that obstructed it; then to <hi>beat the aire</hi> to little purpose, in declaiming against those that did <hi>not hear</hi> us, and we were sure would <hi>little regard</hi> us. For <hi>Secondly,</hi> were it not for the confirming of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> our <hi>Protestant hearers</hi> in their present belief of the <hi>Truth,</hi> against such as will attempt to <hi>draw</hi> them from us: it would be a very <hi>impertinent</hi> thing to insist much upon the discovery of Popish Errours in our Churches; whither they that should reap most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by such discovery never come. They live <hi>among us</hi> indeed, which the <hi>Turks</hi> do not: but since they <hi>come not</hi> where they may <hi>hear</hi> us; it is all one <hi>to us,</hi> in respect of our Sermons, as if they lived as farre from us as the Turks do. But at such times as <hi>the Clergy</hi> are met together (which is chiefly done at <hi>the Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>) when most of them who are most concerned, both for <hi>their own</hi> sakes and <hi>the peoples</hi> that depend upon them, to have <hi>a right judgment</hi> concerning the Nature and Use of <hi>Indifferent things,</hi> are present: it seemeth to be very <hi>proper,</hi> and (by the blessing of God) may conduce very much to <hi>the edification</hi> of his people in <hi>Truth, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Godliness</hi>; that <hi>the just power</hi> of those that have <hi>authority</hi> in the Church for making <hi>Ecclesiastical Constitutions</hi> should be <hi>asserted,</hi> and <hi>the necessity</hi> of yielding <hi>obedience</hi> thereunto when
<pb facs="tcp:64019:9"/>
they are made, by all under such <hi>authority</hi> should be <hi>pressed.</hi> This is the very truth of <hi>the whole businesse.</hi> And what is there in all this, to deserve such <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes?</hi> What is there, if men would but <hi>soberly</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, that is not every way agreeable to the dictates both of Christian Prudence and Charity? <hi>Thirdly,</hi>

            <p n="11">§. XI. To the substance of <hi>the Second Objection,</hi> (if I may with their <hi>leave</hi> and without their <hi>offence,</hi> pass by that <hi>quaint minute piece</hi> of wit, of <hi>Paper-pellets</hi> and <hi>Canon-bullets</hi>;) I shall need make no farther <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi> then what hath already been given to <hi>the First.</hi> Only I shall <hi>ex abundanti</hi> adde <hi>two</hi> things: the one, concerning <hi>my self</hi>; the other, to <hi>the Objectors.</hi> For <hi>my selfe</hi>; if I be not much mistaken, I have been so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> far from <hi>offending</hi> in the kinde objected, that I may seem rather to have <hi>offended</hi> too much on the other hand. <hi>The substance of the matter</hi> both against <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> is I hope all along justifiable. And then, if some <hi>sharper expressions</hi> both against <hi>them</hi> and <hi>others</hi> have here and there slipt from my <hi>tongue</hi> or <hi>pen,</hi> (such as <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>indignation</hi> in our <hi>greener years</hi> are apt to suggest;) they that are <hi>ingenuous,</hi> considering how long it is since <hi>those Sermons</hi> were preached, may be pleased to <hi>pardon</hi> it, upon the old plea <hi>Dandum ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid aetati.</hi> As for <hi>them</hi>; that they preach against <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>Popery,</hi> I not at all mislike: Only I could wish, that these <hi>two Cautions</hi> were better observed, then (as far as I can make <hi>conjecture</hi> of the rest, by the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what hath come to my <hi>knowledge</hi>) I fear they usually are, by <hi>the more zealous</hi> of that party. viz. 1. That they do not through <hi>ignorance, prejudice,</hi> or <hi>precipitancy</hi> call that <hi>Popery,</hi> which is not; and then under that <hi>name</hi> and <hi>notion</hi> preach against it. 2.

It is not a business merely of <hi>the Lungs</hi> but requireth <hi>Sinews</hi> too.

            <p n="12">§. XII. To <hi>the Third Objection.</hi> I say <hi>first</hi>; That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> we have indeed no higher or other esteem of <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> then as of <hi>indifferent things</hi>: yet we do not count them <hi>Trifles</hi>; otherwise then as in comparison with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>necessary duties.</hi> But let <hi>Ceremonies (secondly)</hi> be as very <hi>Trifles,</hi> as any man can imagine them to be; yet <hi>Obedience</hi> sure is no <hi>Trifle.</hi> They mis-state <hi>the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi> when they talke of pressing <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> It is <hi>Obedience</hi> (formally) that is required: <hi>Ceremonies</hi> not otherwise pressed, then as <hi>the matter</hi> wherein that <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> is to be exercised. If a <hi>Master</hi> appoint his <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> to do some small matter that he thinketh fit to have done, though in it selfe of no great moment; yet he will expect to be <hi>obeyed</hi>: and it is great reason he should. If in such case <hi>the servant</hi> should <hi>refuse</hi> to do the thing appointed, because he hath <hi>no minde</hi> thereunto, and should receive a check or correction for such refusal: could he either sufficiently <hi>excuse</hi> his own <hi>fault,</hi> or reasonably <hi>complain</hi> of his <hi>Master</hi> for dealing hardly with him, by saying the thing was but <hi>a Trifle?</hi> Is it not evident, that the thing which made <hi>the Master</hi> angry, and <hi>the Servant</hi> an offender in <hi>that Case,</hi> was not (<hi>precisely</hi> and <hi>formally</hi>) the leaving of the thing <hi>undone,</hi> (which had it not been <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> might have been left <hi>undone</hi> without any <hi>fault</hi> or <hi>blame</hi> at all;) but <hi>the refusing</hi> to do it, when he that had <hi>a right</hi> to his service <hi>commanded</hi> him? Wherefore <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that which is said of some mens <hi>doting</hi> so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> on <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> might have been well enough spared.

It is true <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that there have been long and <hi>unkinde quarrels</hi> about these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> things? More is <hi>the pity!</hi> but where is <hi>the fault?</hi> To whom is <hi>the beginning,</hi> and to whom <hi>the continuance</hi> of a quarrel rather imputable? to him, that <hi>demandeth</hi> his right? or to him that <hi>with-holdeth</hi> it from him? For this is the plain <hi>Case</hi> in short: <hi>The Bishops (under the King)</hi> require <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>Lawes Ecclesiastical</hi>; these men <hi>refuse</hi> to give it. So <hi>began the quarrel</hi> at first: and upon the same termes it <hi>continued.</hi> If the <hi>Obedience</hi> challenged were indeed due to those Lawes; then did our <hi>Brethren</hi> both <hi>begin</hi> the quarrel, and <hi>hold it on</hi>: if it were not, then must the whole <hi>blame</hi> lye upon those that <hi>claimed it unjustly,</hi> and not upon them. So that in the winding up of the business, the whole <hi>Controversie</hi> will devolve upon this point; Whether to <hi>the lawes Ecclesiastical</hi> obedience be due or not? For the right determining whereof, (for so much as it is confest on all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:64019:11"/>§. XIII. <hi>The Fourth Objection.</hi> Wherein (besides some <hi>ill-language,</hi> which I love not to stirr into,) they declare, <hi>First,</hi> what they conceive to be our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and <hi>next</hi> what is indeed their Own concerning <hi>the Ceremonies</hi> &amp;c. in question.

That, when for <hi>decency, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> order,</hi> or <hi>uniformity's</hi> sake, any <hi>Constitutions</hi> are made concerning them; there is the same <hi>necessity</hi> of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such <hi>Constitutions,</hi> as there is of obeying other <hi>Laws</hi> made for the good of <hi>the Common-wealth</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any other <hi>indifferent</hi> things. That such <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> either in the one or the other, ariseth not properly from <hi>the authority</hi> of the immediate <hi>Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> but from <hi>the Ordinance of God,</hi> who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to obey <hi>the ordinances of men</hi> for his sake. That such <hi>necessity of Obedience</hi> notwithstanding, <hi>the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> things</hi> remain in the same <hi>indifferency,</hi> as before. Every way in respect of their Nature; and <hi>quoad Rem,</hi> (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not in the power of <hi>accidental relations</hi> to change <hi>the natures</hi> of things:) and even in respect of their <hi>Vse,</hi> and <hi>quoad nos</hi> thus far, that there is <hi>a liberty</hi> left for men, upon extraordinary and other just occasions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sometimes to do otherwise then the Constitution re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, <hi>extra casum Scandali &amp; Contemptus.

And then and thenceforth they lose their <hi>obligation</hi>: whereby <hi>the necessity</hi> of yeelding <hi>obedience</hi> thereunto wholy ceaseth and determineth; and <hi>the things</hi> thereby <hi>commanded</hi> or <hi>prohibited</hi> return to their primitive and natural <hi>indifferency,</hi> even in their <hi>Vse</hi> also, and <hi>in respect of us.</hi> This is clearly <hi>our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>: and men may easily so understand us, if they will.</p>

uncertain, if they go on with the work of <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> they have begun, with as <hi>quick dispatch,</hi> and at the rate they have done these last <hi>two seaven</hi> years. The having of <hi>Godfathers</hi> at baptism, <hi>Churching</hi> of women, <hi>Prayers</hi> at the burial of the dead, children asking their <hi>Parents blessing,</hi> &amp;c. which whilome were held <hi>innocent</hi>; are now by very many thrown aside, as raggs of <hi>Popery.</hi> Nay, are not some gone so farre already, as to cast into the same heap, not only the ancient hymne <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> (for the <hi>repeating</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of alone some have been <hi>deprived</hi> of all their <hi>lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods</hi>) and <hi>the Apostles Creed</hi>: but even the use of <hi>the Lords Prayer it selfe?</hi>—And what will <hi>ye do</hi> in the end thereof?

But to be <hi>serious,</hi> and not to indulge my selfe too much <hi>merriment</hi> in so <hi>sad</hi> a business: I believe, all those men will be found much mistaken, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther measure <hi>the Protestant Religion</hi> by an opposition to <hi>Popery</hi>; or account all <hi>Popery,</hi> that is <hi>taught</hi> or <hi>practised</hi> in <hi>the Church of Rome.</hi> Our godly <hi>Fore-fathers,</hi> to whom (under God) we owe the purity of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and some of which laid down their <hi>lives for the defense</hi> of the same, were sure <hi>of another minde</hi>: if we may, from what they <hi>did,</hi> judge what they <hi>thought.</hi> They had no <hi>purpose</hi> (nor had they any warrant) to set up <hi>a new Religion,</hi> but to reform <hi>the Old:</hi> by purging it from those <hi>Innovations,</hi> which in tract of time (some sooner, some later,) had <hi>mingled</hi> with it,
<pb facs="tcp:64019:13"/>
and <hi>corrupted</hi> it, both in <hi>the Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worship.</hi> According to this <hi>purpose</hi> they produced, without <hi>constraint</hi> or <hi>precipitancy,</hi> freely and advisedly, as in <hi>peaceable times</hi>; and brought their intentions to <hi>a happy end:</hi> as by <hi>the result</hi> thereof, contained in <hi>the Articles</hi> and <hi>Liturgy</hi> of our Church, and <hi>the Prefaces</hi> thereunto, doth fully appear. From hence chiefly, as I conceive, we are to take our best scantling, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to judge <hi>what is,</hi> and <hi>what is not,</hi> to be esteemed <hi>Popery.</hi> All those <hi>Doctrines</hi> then, held by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> which are either <hi>contrary</hi> to the written <hi>word of God</hi>; or but <hi>super-added thereunto,</hi> as <hi>necessary points of Faith</hi> to be of all Christians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved under pain of <hi>damnation</hi>: and all those <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions</hi> used in <hi>the worship</hi> of God, which either are <hi>unlawful,</hi> as being <hi>contrary</hi> to the Word; or being <hi>not contrary</hi> and therefore <hi>abritrary</hi> and <hi>indifferent,</hi> are made <hi>Essentials,</hi> and imposed as <hi>necessary parts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>: these are, as I take it, the things whereunto the name of <hi>Popery</hi> doth properly and peculiarly belong.

The things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the power of <hi>Christianity</hi> consisteth, are of two sorts; <hi>Credenda,</hi> and <hi>Agenda</hi>: which we usually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Manners.</hi> And <hi>the Scripture</hi> we acknowledge to be a <hi>perfect Rule</hi> of Both: yet not as <hi>excluding</hi> the use of <hi>Reason</hi>; but <hi>supposing it.</hi> When God gave us <hi>the light</hi> of his holy <hi>Word</hi>; he left us, as he found us; <hi>reasonable</hi> creatures still: without any purpose, by the gift of that greater and sublimer <hi>light,</hi> to put out the <hi>light</hi> he had formerly given us (that <hi>of Reason</hi>) or to render it <hi>useless</hi> and unserviceable.

might <hi>embrace</hi> the one, and <hi>reject</hi> the other; and <hi>Good</hi> from <hi>Evil,</hi> that we might <hi>do</hi> the one, and <hi>shun</hi> the other.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> Lastly, there is <hi>Scandall</hi> in judging. Possibly he that is judged, may have that strength of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> that though rash and uncharitable censures lie thick in his way, he can lightly skip over all those <hi>stumbling-blocks,</hi> and scape a fall. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had such a measure of strength; <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 4.5.</note> 
               <hi>With me it is a very small thing,</hi> saith he, <hi>that I should be judged of you, or of humane judgement,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. If our judging light upon such an object, it is indeed no <hi>scandall</hi> to him: but that's no <hi>thanks</hi> to us. We are to esteem things by their <hi>natures,</hi> not <hi>events:</hi> and therefore we <hi>give</hi> a scandall, if we <hi>judge</hi>; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> notwithstanding he that is judged <hi>take</hi> it not as a scandall. For, that <hi>judging</hi> is in it self a <hi>scandall,</hi> is clear from ver. 13. of this Chapter; <hi>Let us not therefore,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul, judge one another any more, but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling-block, or an occasion to fall in his brothers way.</hi> And thus we see four <hi>main Reasons</hi> against this <hi>judging</hi> of our brethren. 1. We have <hi>no right to</hi> judge; and so our judging is <hi>usurpation.</hi> 2. We may <hi>erre</hi> in our judgements; and so our judging is <hi>rashnesse.</hi> 3. We take things <hi>the worst way</hi> when we judge; and so our judging is <hi>uncharitable.</hi> 4. We offer occasion of <hi>offence</hi> by our judging; and so our judging is <hi>scandalous.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> And so I have done with my Text in the general use of it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we have seen the two faults of <hi>despising,</hi> and of <hi>judging</hi> our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren laid open; and the uglinesse of both discovered. I now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to make such <hi>Application,</hi> as I promised, both of the <hi>case</hi> and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64019:35"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <hi>rules,</hi> unto some <hi>differences,</hi> and to some <hi>offences,</hi> given and taken in our Church in point of <hi>Ceremony.</hi> The Case ruled in my Text was of <hi>eating,</hi> and not <hi>eating:</hi> the Differences which some maintain in our Church, are many in the particular; (as of <hi>kneeling,</hi> and not <hi>kneeling; wearing,</hi> and <hi>not wearing; crossing,</hi> and not <hi>crossing,</hi> &amp;c.) But all these, and most of the rest of them, may be comprehended in grosse under the terms of <hi>conforming,</hi> and not <hi>conforming.</hi> Let us first compare <hi>the Cases</hi>; that having found wherein they <hi>agree,</hi> or <hi>disagree,</hi> we may thereby judge how far S. <hi>Pauls</hi> advice in my Text ought to rule us, for not <hi>despising,</hi> for not <hi>judging</hi> one another. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> There are <hi>four</hi> speciall things, wherein if we compare this <hi>our Case</hi> with the Apostles; in every of the four we shall find some agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and some disparity also: 1. The nature of the <hi>matter:</hi> 2. The abilities of the <hi>persons:</hi> 3. Their severall <hi>practise</hi> about the things: and 4. Their mutuall <hi>carriage</hi> one towards another. And first, let us consider how the <hi>two Cases</hi> agree in each of these.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>the matter</hi> whereabout the <hi>eater</hi> and the <hi>not-eater</hi> differed in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> the case of <hi>the Romans,</hi> was in the nature of it <hi>indifferent:</hi> so it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> between <hi>the conformer</hi> and not <hi>conformer</hi> in our Case. As there <hi>fish,</hi> and <hi>flesh,</hi> and <hi>herbs</hi> were meerly <hi>indifferent</hi>; such as might be eaten, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> or not eaten without sin: so here <hi>Cap</hi> and <hi>Surplis, Crosse</hi> and <hi>Ring,</hi> and the rest, are things meerly <hi>indifferent</hi>; such as (in regard of their own <hi>nature</hi>) may be <hi>used</hi> or <hi>not used</hi> without sin; as being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expresly <hi>commanded,</hi> nor expresly <hi>forbidden</hi> in the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>Persons</hi> agree. For as there, so here also; some <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> are <hi>strong in faith,</hi> some <hi>weak.</hi> There are many, whose judgements are upon certain and infallible grounds assured and resolved, and that <hi>certitudine Fidei,</hi> that <hi>Cap,</hi> and <hi>Surplis,</hi> and <hi>Crosse,</hi> and the rest, are things <hi>lawfull,</hi> and such as may be used with a good Conscience. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> There are some others again, who through <hi>ignorance,</hi> or <hi>custome,</hi> or <hi>prejudice,</hi> or otherwise weakened in their judgements; cannot (or will not) be perswaded, that these things are altogether free from <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry:</hi> nor consequently the use of them from sinne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the <hi>practice</hi> of the persons are much alike. As there,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
               <hi>the strong</hi> did use his liberty according to the assurance of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) and did eat freely without scruple; and <hi>the weak</hi> did <hi>forbear</hi> to eat, because of his doubting and irresolution: So here, most of us in assured confidence that we may <hi>wear,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>crosse,</hi> and <hi>kneel,</hi> and use the other <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Customes</hi> of our Church, do willingly, and <hi>ex animo</hi> conform our selves thereunto. Yet some there are, who out of I know not what nicenesse and <hi>scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulosity,</hi> make dainty of them, and either utterly refuse <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,</hi> or at leastwise desire respite, till they can better inform themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:64019:36"/>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> there is some correspondence also in <hi>the faulty carriage</hi> of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the parties each towards other. For as there <hi>the Eater</hi> despised <hi>the Not-eater</hi>; and <hi>the Not-eater</hi> judged <hi>the Eater</hi>: so here, it cannot be denied, but that some <hi>Conformers</hi> (although I hope far the lesser, I am sure far the worser sort,) do despise and scandalize <hi>the Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers</hi> more than they have reason to do, or any discreet ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man will allow. But is it not most certain also, that <hi>the Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers</hi> (but too generally, yea, and the better sort of them too, but too often and much) do passe their <hi>censures</hi> with marvellous great freedome; and spend their judgements liberally upon, and against <hi>the Conformers?</hi> Hitherto <hi>the Cases</hi> seem to agree. One would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> think, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> the Apostles rule would as well fit our Church and Case, as <hi>the Romane</hi> and should as well free <hi>the Non-Conformers</hi> from our <hi>Contempt,</hi> as us from their <hi>Censures. Let not him that</hi> conformeth, <hi>despise him that</hi> conformeth not: <hi>and let not him that</hi> conformeth not, <hi>judge him that</hi> conformeth.</p>
            <p>But if you will please to take a second surview of the <hi>four</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> particulars, wherein <hi>the Cases</hi> seemed to agree; you shall find <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> very much disparity and disproportion betwixt <hi>the two Cases</hi> in each of <hi>the four</hi> respects. In the case of my Text, the <hi>matter</hi> of difference among them, was not onely indifferent in the <hi>nature</hi> of it; but it was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> also left as indifferent for the <hi>use:</hi> the Church (<hi>perhaps</hi>) not having <hi>determined</hi> any thing positively therein; at least no publick autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity having either <hi>enjoyned,</hi> or <hi>forbidden,</hi> the use of such or such meates. But in the Case of our Church it is far otherwise. <hi>Capp, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plis, Crosse, Ring</hi> and other <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which are the Matter of our differences, though they be things <hi>indifferent</hi> for their <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>in themselves:</hi> yet are not so for their <hi>use,</hi> and <hi>unto us.</hi> If <hi>the Church</hi> had been silent, if <hi>Authority</hi> had prescribed nothing herein; these <hi>Ceremonies</hi> had then remained for their <hi>use,</hi> as they are for their <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> indifferent: <hi>Lawfull,</hi> and such as might be <hi>used</hi> without sin; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and yet <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> and such as might be also <hi>forborn</hi> without sin.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64019:38"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and it would have well become them for the avoiding of <hi>scandall</hi> so to have done; which we cannot do without <hi>greater scandall</hi> in the open contempt of <hi>lawfull authority:</hi>) yet we do not <hi>despise</hi> them, (I mean with allowance from the Church: if particular men do more than they should, it is their private fault, and ought not to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, or to our Church) but use all good means we can to draw them to <hi>moderate courses</hi> and just <hi>obedience</hi>; although they better deserve to be <hi>despised</hi> than the weak Romans did: they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly <hi>Weak,</hi> ours <hi>Obstinate</hi>; they <hi>Timorous,</hi> ours also <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous.</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Now these differences are opened betwixt the Case in my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> Text, and the Case of our Church: we may the better judge how far forth Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> advice here given to the Romans in their case of <hi>eating,</hi> and <hi>not-eating,</hi> ought to rule us in our case of <hi>confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi> and <hi>not-conforming</hi> in point of Ceremony. And first, of <hi>not despising:</hi> then of <hi>not judging.</hi> The ground of the Apostles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for not despising him that ate not, was his <hi>weaknesse.</hi> So far then as this ground holdeth in our case, this precept is to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and no further. And we are hereby bound not to despise our <hi>Non-conforming</hi> Brethren, so far forth as it may probably appear <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to us they are <hi>weak</hi> and not wilfull. But so farre forth, as by their courses and proceedings it may be reasonably thought their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall</hi> proceedeth from corrupt or partiall <hi>affections,</hi> or is apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintained with <hi>obstinacy</hi> and <hi>contempt:</hi> I take it we may, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding <hi>the Apostles</hi> admonition in my Text, in some sort even <hi>despise</hi> them.</p>
            <p>But because they think they are not so well and sairly dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> as they should be: Let us consider their particular <hi>grievances,</hi> wherein they take themselves despised; and examine how just they are.

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> all such <hi>Ministers</hi> as are not endowed with gifts for <hi>the Pulpit,</hi> they damne, as <hi>hirelings,</hi> and not sheepherds: calling them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> 
               <hi>idol-Sheepherds</hi>; betrayers of Christs flock; <hi>intruders</hi> into the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery without a Calling; <hi>dumbe Dogs,</hi> and I know not how many names besides. Yea, although they be such as are diligent, according to their measure of gifts, to perform such duties as the Church requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: to present <hi>the prayers</hi> of the people to God; to declare (by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> they judge all such as <hi>interpose</hi> for the Churches peace,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> and <hi>oppose</hi> their novelties, as enemies to all goodnesse, men of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane mindes; haters of <hi>Religion</hi>; despisers of the Word; <hi>persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> of the Brethren; impes of Satan; instruments of Hell; and such as utterly abhorre all godly and Christian courses.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> and lastly (for I irke to rake longer in this sink) they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray themselves to be manifest <hi>Iudges</hi> of all that are not of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> stamp; by singling out unto themselves, and those that favour them, certain proper Appellations, of <hi>Brethren,</hi> and <hi>Good-men,</hi> and <hi>Professors:</hi> as if none had <hi>Brotherhood</hi> in Christ, none had interest in <hi>goodnesse,</hi> none made <hi>Profession</hi> of the Gospel, but themselves. Whereas others have received <hi>the signe</hi> of their <hi>Profession</hi> in their foreheads after <hi>Baptisme,</hi> which perhaps they did not: whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers daily stand up in the Congregation to make <hi>Profession</hi> of their <hi>Christian belief,</hi> which it may be they do not: or, (if those things be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> not materiall) whereas others by the grace of God are as stedfastly resolved in their hearts, if need should be, to seale the truth of their <hi>profession</hi> with their <hi>blood,</hi> as any of them can be.</p>
            <p>But they will say, these peremptory Censures are but the faults <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> of some few: all are not so hot and fiery. There be others that are more <hi>temperate</hi> in their speeches, and <hi>Moderate</hi> in their courses; and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64019:41"/>
desire onely they may be spared for their own particular: but they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> preach not against any of these things, nor intermeddle to make more stirres in the Church.</p>
            <p>I answer <hi>first:</hi> it were lamentable, if this were not so;
<hi rend="margQuotes">If all were of that <hi>hot temper,</hi> or <hi>distemper</hi> rather, that many are; they would quickly tire out themselves without spurring. F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet of some that carry themselves with to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable moderation <hi>outwardly</hi>; we have some cause to suspect, that they do <hi>inwardly</hi> and in their hearts <hi>judge</hi> as deeply, as the hottest spirited railers. And we gather it from their forwardnesse at every <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> turn, and upon every slender occasion, obliquely to gird, and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to glance at our <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>the discipline</hi> and <hi>the Ceremonies</hi> thereof, as far as they well dare. And if such men meddle no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we may reasonably think, <note n="a" place="margin">

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> though they preach not against these things in <hi>the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Congregations</hi>; yet in their <hi>private conventicles</hi> it is not unknown some do. Though their <hi>Pulpits</hi> do not ring with it; yet their <hi>Houses</hi> do: though their ordinary <hi>Sermons ad populum</hi> be more modest; yet their set <hi>conferences</hi> are sometimes but too free, especially when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> they are required their opinions by those that invite them.

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> although both their <hi>Pulpits</hi> and <hi>Tables</hi> should be silent: yet their <hi>Practice</hi> sufficiently preacheth their dislike.

            <p>Thus have I endeavoured, having the opportunity of this place,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> (as I held my self both in <hi>Conscience,</hi> and in regard of my <hi>Subscription</hi> bound) to deliver my opinion freely, so far as my Text gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> concerning <hi>the Ceremoniall Constitutions</hi> of our Church: and therein laboured to free, not onely the <hi>conformer</hi> from all unjust <hi>censures</hi>; but even the <hi>non-conformer</hi> also, so far as he hath reason to expect it, from all scandalous <hi>despisings.</hi> I beseech you pardon my length, if I have been troublesome; I had much to say, and the matter was weighty; and I desired to give some satisfaction in it to those that are contrary-minded; and I have no purpose (for any thing I know) at all to trouble this place any more hereafter.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Little before, at the fourth verse, S. <hi>Paul</hi> had delivered a <hi>Conclusion</hi> sound and comfortable: and strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it from <hi>Davids</hi> both experience, and testimony in <note n="a" place="margin">That thou might'st be justified in thy sayings, and mightest over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come when thou art jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.4.</note> 
               <hi>Ps.</hi> 51. A place pregnant, and full of sinews, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it. The <hi>Conclusion</hi> in effect was, that <hi>Nothing in man can anull the Covenant of God.</hi> Neither <hi>the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall unworthinesse</hi> of Gods Children, through the universall corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of nature; nor their <hi>actuall unfaithfulnesse</hi> bewrayed (through <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> frailty) in particular trials, can alienate <hi>the free love</hi> of God from them, or cut them off from <hi>the Covenant of Grace:</hi> but that still God will be glorified in the truth and <hi>faithfulnesse</hi> of his promises, notwithstanding any unrighteousnesse or <hi>unfaithfulnesse</hi> in man.</p>
            <p>But never yet was any <hi>Truth</hi> so happily innocent, as to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it self free from <hi>Calumny</hi> and <hi>Abuse. Malice</hi> on the one hand, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and <hi>Fleshlinesse</hi> on the other; though with different aimes, yet doe the same work.

               <hi>false</hi> (yet colourable) <hi>Inferences</hi> from the former Conclusion. There are <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Triplex in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniens.</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranus hic.</note> 
               <hi>three</hi> of those <hi>Inferences:</hi> but never a good. <hi>The first</hi>; If so, then cannot God in reason and justice take vengeance of our unrighteousnesse. <hi>The Colour:</hi> for why should he <hi>punish</hi> us for that, which so much magnifieth and commendeth his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> righteousnesse? [<note n="b" place="margin">Verse 5.</note> 
               <hi>But if our righteousnesse commend the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous that taketh vengeance?] The second</hi> Inference: If so; then it is injust either <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in God or Man to condemne us as sinners, for breaking the Law. <hi>The Colour:</hi> for why should that action be censured of sin, which so abundantly redoundeth to the glory of God? [<note n="c" place="margin">Verse 7.</note> 
               <hi>For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lye unto his glory, why yet am I also judged as a sinner?] The third,</hi> and last, and worst Inference: If so, then it is a good and wise resolution, Let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> us sin freely, and boldly commit evil. <hi>The Colour:</hi> for why should we fear to do that, from which so much good may come? in this verse of my Text, [<hi>And not rather let us do evil that good may come.</hi>]</p>
            <p>This last <hi>cavilling Inference,</hi> the Apostle in this Verse both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> bringeth in, and casteth out again: <hi>bringeth in</hi> as an <hi>objection</hi>; and <hi>casteth out</hi> by his <hi>answer.</hi> An answer which at once cutteth off both it, and the former Inferences. And the <hi>Answer</hi> is double: <hi>Ad <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> rem, Ad hominem.</hi> That concerneth the force and matter of <hi>the objection:</hi> this the state, and danger of <hi>the objectors. Ad rem,</hi> in the former part of the Verse; <hi>[And not rather (as we be slanderous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reported, and as some affirm that we say) let us do evil that good may come.] Ad hominem</hi> in the latter end; [<hi>Whose damnation is just.</hi>] In the former part there is an <hi>Objection</hi>; and the <hi>Rejection</hi> of it. The Objection, <hi>And not rather, Let us do evil that good may come.</hi> The Rejection thereof with a <hi>Non sequitur</hi>; implying not onely the bare <hi>inconsequence</hi> of it upon the Apostles conclusion, but withall, and especially <hi>the falsenesse</hi> and unsoundnesse of it taken by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> it self; <hi>As we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say, Let us do evil,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>My aime at this present is to insist especially upon a <hi>Principle</hi> of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
               <hi>practick Divinity:</hi> which by joynt consent of Writers <hi>old</hi> and <hi>new; Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Popish</hi>; resulteth from the very body of this verse, and is of right good use to direct us in sundry difficulties, which dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arise <hi>in vita communi,</hi> in point of Conscience. The Principle is this; <hi>We must not do any evil, that any good may come of it.</hi> Yet there are besides this, in the Text divers other inferiour <hi>observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> not to be neglected. With which I think it will not be amisse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to begin, and to dispatch them first briefly; that so I may fall <hi>the sooner,</hi> and stay <hi>the longer</hi> upon that which I mainly intend.</p>

out of his way for it) as might bring scandall to the <hi>Truth</hi> he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> had delivered. When we preach and instruct others, we should not think it enough to deliver <hi>positive truths:</hi> but we should take good care also, as near as we can, to leave them <hi>clear</hi>; and by prevention to stop <hi>the mouths</hi> of such as love to pick quarrells at <hi>the Truth,</hi> and to bark against the light.

But then especially <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> concerneth it us to be most carefull herein; when we have to speak before such, as we have some cause before-hand to suspect to be, through <hi>ignorance,</hi> or <hi>weaknesse,</hi> or <hi>custome,</hi> or <hi>education,</hi> or <hi>preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,</hi> or <hi>partiall affections,</hi> or otherwise contrary-minded unto, or at leastwise not well perswaded of those <hi>Truths</hi> we are to teach.

We must not do <hi>evil,</hi> that good may come.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>evil</hi> is of two sorts. The evil of <hi>fault,</hi> and the evil of <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> Malum delicti,</hi> and <hi>Malum supplicii</hi>; as <note n="a" place="margin">Tertul. l. 2. adv.

The evil we <hi>do,</hi> unjustly, but yet willingly: and the evil we <hi>suffer,</hi> unwillingly, but yet justly. In a word, the evil of <hi>sin,</hi> and the evil of <hi>pain.</hi> Touching <hi>evils of pain</hi>; if the Case be put, when two such evils are propounded, and both cannot be avoided, whether we may not make choice of the one, to avoid the other. The resolution is <note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Inter haec da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur electio; &amp; minus damnum ficere licet, ut evitetur majus.</hi> Parens hic.</note> common and good from the old Maxime, <hi>E malis minimum,</hi> we may incur the lesse, to prevent the greater evil.
<hi rend="margQuotes">As we may deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our purse to a <hi>Thief,</hi> rather than fight upon unequal terms to save it: and in a tempest cast our wares into <hi>the Sea,</hi> to lighten <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the ship that it wreck not: and indure the lancing and searching of an <hi>old sore,</hi> to keep it from festering and spreading.</hi>
And this <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> in my Text is not a rule for that Case: that being propounded concerning <hi>evils of pain</hi>; whereas my Text is intended onely of <hi>the evils of sin.</hi> We are herehence resolved, that we are not to <hi>do</hi> any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, that good may come of it: for all which yet we may <hi>suffer</hi> some evil, that good may come of it. Although (to note that by the way)
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64019:46"/>
the common answer <hi>è malis minimum,</hi> even in <hi>the evils of pain</hi> is to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> be understood (as most other practical conclusions are) not as simply and <hi>universally</hi>; but as <hi>commonly</hi> and ordinarily true. For (as <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Slater</hi> on this place.</note> one saith well) perhaps there are Cases, wherein two evils of Pain being at once propounded, it may not be safe for us to be our own carvers.</p>
            <p>But I must let passe the Questions concerning <hi>the evils of Pain,</hi> as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> impertinencies. The <hi>evils of sin</hi> are of two sorts. Some are <hi>evil</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, simply, and <hi>per se</hi>; such as are <hi>directly</hi> against the scope and purpose of some of Gods Commandements: as <hi>Atheism</hi> against the first, <hi>Idolatry</hi> against the second, and so against the rest, <hi>Blasphemy, Profanenesse, Disloyalty, Cruelty, Adultery, Injustice, Calumny, Avarice,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and the like; all which are evil in their own nature, and can never <hi>(positis quibuscunque circumstantiis)</hi> be done well. Othersome are <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> onely respectively, and <hi>by accident:</hi> but otherwise in their own nature <hi>indifferent</hi>; and such as may be, and are done sometimes well, sometimes ill. To know the nature of which things the better, since they are of singular use for the resolution of many <hi>Cases of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>: we must yet more distinctly inquire into the different <hi>kinds</hi> (or rather degrees) of <hi>indifferent things</hi>; and into the different <hi>means,</hi> whereby things otherwise <hi>in nature indifferent,</hi> become <hi>accidentally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> for their use.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

This is <hi>the Case.</hi> The <hi>Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is, Whether these latter considerations, and the good that may come thereby, be sufficient to warrant unto him the omission of that necessary duty?</p>
            <p>

considered, that these things were <hi>pro hîc &amp; nunc</hi> necessary to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> rather than any other: if for any outward inferiour respect I should have passed them over with silence; I think I should have much swerved from <hi>the Rule</hi> of my Text, and have done a great <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> that some small <hi>good</hi> might come of it.

<hi rend="margQuotes">They who think to salve the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by this <hi>mitigation</hi>; that at least wise our actions ought to be framed according to those <hi>generall rules</hi> of <hi>the Law of Nature,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> it may be demanded, <hi>What power</hi> the Conscience hath, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> make a thing otherwise good and <hi>lawfull,</hi> to become <hi>unlawfull</hi> and sinfull? and <hi>whence</hi> it hath that power?

               <hi>verily thought in himself, that he ought to do many things contrary to the name of Iesus.</hi> But those their <hi>perswasions</hi> would not serve to justifie those their <hi>actions.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> confesseth himself to have been <note n="e" place="margin">1 Tim. 1.13.</note> 
               <hi>a persecutor, and blasphemer, and injurious</hi> for so doing, although he followed the guidance of his own <hi>conscience</hi> therein: and to have stood in need of <hi>mercy</hi> for the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of those wicked acts, though he did them <hi>ignorantly,</hi> and <note n="f" place="margin">Acts 23.3, 4. &amp; Phil. 3.6.</note> out of <hi>zeal to the Law.</hi> The reason of which difference is, that which I touched in the beginning, even because any <hi>one defect</hi> is enough to render an action <hi>evill</hi>; and consequently a defect in <hi>the agent</hi> may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> do it, though <hi>the substance</hi> of the action remain still (as it was) <hi>good:</hi> but <hi>all conditions</hi> must concur to make an action <hi>good</hi>; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>a right intention</hi> in the agent will not suffice thereunto, so long as <hi>the substance</hi> of the action remaineth still (as it was) <hi>evill. Thirdly,</hi> that <hi>the Conscience</hi> hath this power over mens wils and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> actions by virtue of that unchangeable <hi>Law</hi> of God, which he esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisheth by an ordinance of <hi>nature</hi> in our first creation: that <hi>the will</hi> of every man (which is <hi>the fountain</hi> whence all our <hi>actions</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately flow) should conforme it self to the judgement of <hi>the practique understanding</hi> or <hi>conscience,</hi> as to its proper and immediate <hi>rule,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> yield it self to be guided thereby. So that if <hi>the understanding</hi> through Errour point out a wrong way, and <hi>the will</hi> follow it: the fault is chiefly in <hi>the understanding</hi> for mis-guiding <hi>the will.</hi> But if <hi>the understanding</hi> shew the right way, and <hi>the will</hi> take a wrong: then the fault is meerly in <hi>the will,</hi> for not following that guide which GOD hath set over it.</p>

Nay I say yet further, and I beseech you (brethren) to take notice of it as a matter of speciall use both for the <hi>directing</hi> and <hi>quieting</hi> of your consciences: that ordinarily and in most things we need no other <hi>warrant</hi> for what we do than this onely, that there is not (to our knowledge) any law either of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

Say a man should hold it utterly unlawfull (as some erroneously do,) to play at <hi>cards</hi> or <hi>dice,</hi> or to lay <hi>a wager,</hi> or to cast <hi>lots</hi> in triviall matters: if it be in truth lawfull to do every of these things, (as I make no question but it is, so they be done with <hi>sobriety</hi> and with due <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi>) yet he that is otherwise <hi>perswaded</hi> of them cannot by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that <hi>perswasion</hi> do any of them without sin. Yet, forsomuch as they are things no way <hi>necessary,</hi> but <hi>indifferent</hi>; both in their <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and for their <hi>use</hi> also, no <hi>superiour power</hi> having enjoyned any man to use them, therefore he that judgeth them <hi>unlawfull</hi> may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from them <hi>without sinne,</hi> and so indeed he is in <hi>conscience</hi> bound to do, so long as he continueth to be of that opinion. But now on the other side, if the things so mis-judged to be <hi>unlawfull</hi> be any way <hi>necessary</hi>; either in respect of their <hi>own nature,</hi> or by the injunction of <hi>authority:</hi> then the person is by that his error brought into such <hi>a straite</hi> between two sinnes, as he can by no possible meanes avoid both, so long as he persisteth in that his <hi>errour.</hi> For both if he do the thing, he <hi>goeth against the perswasion</hi> of his conscience, and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> is a great sinne: and if he do it not, either he <hi>omitteth</hi> a necessary duty, or else <hi>disobeyeth</hi> lawfull authority; and to do either of both, is a sinne too. Out of which <hi>snare</hi> since there is no way of escape but one, which is to rectifie his <hi>judgement,</hi> and to quit his pernicious <hi>errour:</hi> it concerneth every man therefore that unfeignedly desireth to do his <hi>duty</hi> in the fear of God, and to keep <hi>a good conscience,</hi> not

So say I too; and am content <hi>that rule</hi> should decide <hi>this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> question:</hi> onely let it be rightly applyed. Thou thinkest it <hi>safer,</hi> where thou doubtest of the unlawfulnesse, <hi>to forbear</hi> then <hi>to do:</hi> as for example, if thou doubtest whether it be lawfull <hi>to kneel</hi> at the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64019:76"/>
Communion, it is safest in thy opinion therefore for thee <hi>not to kneel.</hi> So should I think too, if thou wert left meerly to thine own <hi>liberty.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> But thou dost not consider how thou art caught in thine own net, and how the edge of thine own weapon may be turned upon thee point-blank not to be avoided, thus. If authority command thee <hi>to kneel,</hi> which whether it be lawfull for thee to do, or not, <hi>thou doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>; it cannot choose but thou must needs <hi>doubt</hi> also, whether thou maiest lawfully <hi>disobey,</hi> or not. Now then here apply thine own Rule, <hi>In dubiis pars tutior,</hi> and see what will come of it. Judge, since thou canst not but <hi>doubt</hi> in both cases, whether it be not <hi>the safer</hi> of the two,<note n="a" place="margin">Gregor.</note> 
               <hi>to obey</hi> doubtingly, than to <hi>disobey doubtingly. Tene certum, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte incertum,</hi> is S. <hi>Gregory</hi> his rule: where there is <hi>a certainty,</hi> and <hi>an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> uncertainty,</hi> let the uncertainty go, and hold to that which is certain. Now <hi>the generall</hi> is <hi>certain,</hi> that thou art to obey <hi>the Magistrate</hi> in all things not contrary to the will of God; but <hi>the particular</hi> is <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> whether the thing now commanded thee by <hi>the Magistrate</hi> be contrary to the will of God: (I say uncertain <hi>to thee,</hi> because thou <hi>doubtest</hi> of it.) Deal <hi>safely</hi> therefore, and hold thee to that which is <hi>certain,</hi> and obey.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt yet alledge, that <hi>the Apostle</hi> here condemneth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> the doing of any thing, not onely with a <hi>gainsaying,</hi> but even with <hi>a doubting</hi> conscience: because <hi>doubting</hi> also is contrary to <hi>faith</hi>; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and <hi>he that doubteth is</hi> even for that <hi>condemned, if he eat.</hi> Oh beware of mis-applying <hi>Scripture</hi>! it is a thing easily done, but not so easily answered. I know not any one gap that hath let in more and more dangerous errours into the Church, than this: that men take <hi>the words</hi> of the sacred Text fitted to <hi>particular occasions,</hi> and to the condition of the <hi>times</hi> wherein they were written; and then <hi>apply</hi> them to themselves and others as they find them, without due respect had to <hi>the differences</hi> that may be between those <hi>times</hi> and <hi>cases,</hi> and the present. Sundry things spoken in Scripture agreeably to that <hi>infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of the Church, would sort very ill with the Church in her fulnesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>stature:</hi> and sundry directions very expedient in times of <hi>persecution,</hi> and when believers lived mingled with <hi>Infidels,</hi> would be very unseasonably urged where the Churc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> is in a <hi>peaceable</hi> and <hi>flourishing</hi> estate, enjoying the <hi>favour</hi> and living under <hi>the protection</hi> of gracious and religious Princes. Thus <hi>the Constitutions</hi> that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles made concerning <hi>Deacons</hi> and <hi>Widowes</hi> in those primitive times, are with much importunity, but very importunely withall, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>the Disciplinarians:</hi> And sundry other like things I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in of this kind, worthy the discovery, but that I fear to grow tedious. Briefely then, the Apostles whole discourse in this Chapter,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and so wheresoever else he toucheth upon the point of <hi>Scandals,</hi> is to be understood onely in that case where men are left <hi>to their own liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in the use of indifferent things: the <hi>Romans, Corinthians,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote about these matters, being not <hi>limited</hi> any way in the exercise of their <hi>liberty</hi> therein by any over-ruling
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64019:76"/>
               <hi>authority.</hi> But where the Magistrates have interposed, &amp; thought good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> upon mature advice to <hi>impose Laws</hi> upon those that are under them, whereby their <hi>liberty</hi> is (not <hi>infringed,</hi> as some unjustly complain, in the <hi>inward judgement,</hi> but onely) <hi>limited</hi> in the <hi>outward exercise</hi> of it: there the Apostolical directions wil not hold in the same <hi>absolute man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> as they were delivered to those whom they then concerned; but only in <hi>the equity</hi> of them, so far forth as the cases are alike, &amp; with such meet <hi>qualifications</hi> &amp; <hi>mitigations,</hi> as the difference of the cases other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise doth require. So that a man ought not out of private fancy, or meerly because he would not be observed for not doing as others do, or for any the like weak respects, to do that thing of the <hi>lawfulness</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> whereof he is not <hi>competently perswaded,</hi> where it is <hi>free</hi> for him to do otherwise: w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was the case of these <hi>weak ones</hi> among <hi>the Romans,</hi> for whose sakes principally the Apostle gave these directions. But the <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the Magistrate intervening so alters the case, that such a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance as to them was <hi>necessary,</hi> is to as many of us as are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to do this or that, altogether <hi>unlawful,</hi> in regard they were <hi>free,</hi> &amp; we are <hi>bound:</hi> for the reasons already shewn, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I now rehearse not.</p>
            <p>But you will yet say, (for in point of <hi>obedience</hi> men are very loth to <hi>yield</hi> so long as they can find any thing to <hi>plead,</hi>) those that lay <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> 
               <hi>these burdens</hi> upon us, at leastwise should do well to satisfie <hi>our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> doubts,</hi> and <hi>to inform</hi> our consciences concerning <hi>the lawfulnesse</hi> of what they enjoyn; that so we might render them <hi>obedience</hi> with better <hi>cheerfulness.</hi> How willing are we sinful men to leave the blame of our miscarriages any where rather than upon our selves! But how is it not incongruous the while, that those men should <hi>prescribe rules</hi> to their governours, who can scarcely brook their governours should <hi>prescribe Laws</hi> to them? <note n="a" place="margin">

prayer</hi> concerning that argument: enough to satisfie those that are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> peaceable, and not disposed to stretch their wits to cavill at things established. And thus much of the <hi>second Question,</hi> touching <hi>a doubting conscience:</hi> whereon I have insisted the longer, because it is a point both so proper to <hi>the Text,</hi> &amp; whereat so many have stumbled.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> There remaineth but one <hi>other Question,</hi> and that of far smaller difficulty; What is to be done, when the conscience is <hi>scrupulous?</hi> I call that a <hi>scruple,</hi> when a man is reasonably well perswaded of <hi>the lawfulnesse</hi> of a thing, yet hath withall some <hi>jealousies</hi> and <hi>fears,</hi> lest perhaps it should prove <hi>unlawfull.</hi> Such scruples are most incident to men of <hi>melancholy</hi> dispositions, or of <hi>timorous</hi> spirits; especially <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> if they be <hi>tender-conscienced</hi> withall: and they are much encreased by the false <hi>suggestions</hi> of Satan; by reading <hi>the books,</hi> or hearing <hi>the Sermons,</hi> or frequenting <hi>the company</hi> of men more strict, precise, and austere in sundry points, than they need or ought to be; and by sundry other means which I now mention not. Of which <hi>scruples</hi> it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> behooveth every man, <hi>first,</hi> to be wary that he do not at all <hi>admit</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> them, if he can chuse: or, if he cannot wholly avoid them, that <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> he endeavour so far as may be <hi>to eject</hi> them speedily out of his thoughts, as <hi>Satans snares,</hi> and things that may breed him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser inconveniencies: or, if he cannot be so rid of them, that then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>thirdly</hi> he resolve to go on according to the more <hi>profitable perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of his mind, and <hi>despise</hi> those scruples. And this he may do with a good conscience, not onely in things <hi>commanded</hi> him by lawfull <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> but even in things <hi>indifferent</hi> and arbitrary, and wherein he is left to his own <hi>liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> Much more might have been added for the farther both <hi>declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>confirmation</hi> of these points. But you see I have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to wrap things together, that deserve a more full and distinct handling, that I might hold some proportion with the time. I had a purpose briefly to have comprised the summe of what I have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> delivered, concerning <hi>a gainsaying, a doubting,</hi> and <hi>a scrupulous</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, in some few <hi>conclusions</hi> for your better remembrance, and to have added also something by way of <hi>direction,</hi> what course might be the most probably taken for <hi>the correcting</hi> of <hi>an erroneous</hi> conscience, for <hi>the setling</hi> of <hi>a doubtfull</hi> conscience, and for <hi>the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of <hi>a scrupulous</hi> conscience. But it is more then time that I should give place to other business: and the most, and most material of those directions, have been here and there occasionally touched in that which hath been delivered already: in which respect I may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter spare that labour. Beseech we God the Father of our Lord Jesus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Christ so to endue us all with the grace of his holy Spirit, that in our whole conversations we may unfeignedly endeavour to preserve a <hi>good conscience,</hi> and to yield all <hi>due obedience</hi> to him first, and then to every Ordinance of man for his sake.</p>
            <p>Now to this <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and blessed <hi>Spirit,</hi> three persons, and one eternall <hi>God,</hi> be ascribed all the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> the <hi>power</hi> and the <hi>glory,</hi> both now and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <hi>succour</hi> those that are <hi>distressed</hi> and oppressed; and to help and relieve them to his power.

The lame man</hi> perhaps hath his <hi>eyes</hi> and sight perfect, and knoweth which way he should goe, and seeth it well enough: but because he wanteth his <hi>limbs,</hi> he is not able to stir a foot forward; and therefore he must have patience perforce, and be content to sit still, because he cannot doe withall.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the one, and <hi>supporting</hi> the other. Abroad in the world there are many, in every Society, Corporation, and Congregation, there are some, of both sorts: some <hi>Blind,</hi> some <hi>Lame.</hi> Some that stand in need of <hi>Counsel,</hi> and Advice, and Direction; as the <hi>Blind:</hi> others that stand in need of <hi>Help,</hi> and Assistance, and

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and <hi>reasons</hi> of most of them, opened.

            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 13.1.</note> 
               <hi>The powers that are, are ordained of God:</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> yet Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calleth the Magistracy an <note n="b" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.13.</note> 
               <hi>humane ordinance.</hi> Certainly the holy Spirit of God, which speaketh in these two great Apostles, is not contrary to it self. The truth is, the <hi>substance of the power</hi> of every Magistrate is <hi>the Ordinance of God</hi>; and that is Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning: but <hi>the Specification of the circumstances</hi> thereto belonging, as in regard of places, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, titles, continuance, jurisdiction, subordination, and the rest,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> is (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> termeth it) <hi>an humane ordinance,</hi> introduced by <hi>Custome,</hi> or positive <hi>Law.</hi> And therefore some kindes of <hi>Magistracy</hi> are higher, some lower, some annuall or for a set time, some during life; some after one manner, some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another: according to the severall <hi>Lawes</hi> or <hi>Customes</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they are grounded. As in other circumstances, so in this concerning the deputation of <hi>the Magistrates person,</hi> there is great difference: some having their power by <hi>Succession,</hi> others by <hi>Nomination,</hi> and other some by <hi>Election.</hi> As amongst us, the supreme Magistrate, <hi>the King,</hi> hath his Power by <hi>succession</hi>; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> some inferiour Magistrates theirs, by <hi>nomination,</hi> or speciall appointment, either immediately, or mediately from the King; as most of our <hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Iustices:</hi> some again by the <hi>electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and voices of the multitude; as most <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> in our <hi>Cities, Corporations,</hi> or <hi>Colledges.</hi> The Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which I would inferre from my Text, cannot reach the <hi>first</hi> kind; because such Magistrates are <hi>born</hi> to us not <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen</hi> by us. They do concern in some sort, the <hi>second</hi>; but most neerly <hi>the third kind, viz.</hi> Those that are <hi>chosen</hi> by suffrages and voices: and therefore unto this <hi>third kind</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> I will apply them. We may not think, because our <hi>voices</hi> are our own, that therefore we may bestow them as we list: neither must we suffer our selves in a matter of this nature to be carried by <hi>favour, faction, spight, hope, feare, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,</hi> or any other corrupt and partiall respect, from those Rules, which ought to levell our choice. But we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre our <hi>voices,</hi> and our best <hi>furtherance</hi> otherwise, upon those whom, all things duly considered, we conceive to be <hi>the fittest:</hi> and the greater <hi>the place</hi> is, and the more <hi>the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi> is we give unto them and from our selves; the greater <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ought our care in <hi>voycing</hi> to be.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> works of <hi>Hypocrites</hi>; are: <hi>First,</hi> the manifestation of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> own <hi>Goodnesse</hi>: that we might know how willing he is to <hi>cherish</hi> the least spark of any <hi>goodness</hi> in any man; be it <hi>natural,</hi> or <hi>moral,</hi> or whatever other goodnesse it be: that he might thereby encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us, so to labour the improvement of those <hi>good things</hi> in us, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as to make our selves capable of greater rewards. <hi>Secondly</hi>; his <hi>Iustice</hi> and equity, in measuring unto Sinners and <hi>Hypocrites exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> according to the measure they mete unto him. They <hi>serve</hi> him with <hi>graces,</hi> which are not <hi>true graces</hi> indeed; he <hi>rewardeth</hi> them with <hi>blessings,</hi> which are not indeed <hi>true blessings.</hi> Somewhat they must do to <hi>God</hi>; and therefore they affoord him a little <hi>tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obedience,</hi> and there is all <hi>the service</hi> he shall have from them:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Somewhat God will do for them, and in requitall alloweth them a little <hi>temporary favour,</hi> and there is all <hi>the reward</hi> they must look for from him. Here is <hi>Quid pro Quo.</hi> They give <hi>God</hi> the <hi>outward work,</hi> but without any <hi>hearty affection</hi> to him: <hi>God</hi> giveth them the <hi>outward benefit,</hi> but without any <hi>hearty affection</hi> to them. For want of which <hi>hearty affection</hi> on both sides, it cometh to passe, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is <hi>the outward work</hi> truly <hi>acceptable</hi> to him, nor <hi>the outward bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> truly <hi>profitable</hi> to them. A <hi>third</hi> reason of <hi>Gods</hi> thus graciously dealing even with <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> may be assigned, with reference to his own dear <hi>Children</hi> and chosen; for <hi>whose good</hi> especially (next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his <hi>own glory</hi>) all the passages of his <hi>divine providence</hi> both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them and others are disposed in such sort as they are: as for whose <hi>comfort,</hi> this manner of proceeding maketh very much and sundry wayes; as I shall by and by touch in <hi>the Inferences</hi> from this Observation; whereunto I now come, because it is time I should draw towards a Conclusion.</p>

               <note place="margin">§. 26.</note>And <hi>first</hi>; by what hath been already said a way is opened for the clearing of <hi>Gods Holinesse</hi> in these his proceedings.<note place="margin">

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> or approved their <hi>Obedience.</hi> No: it is but <hi>Lex Talionis</hi>; he deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with them, as they deal with him- They do him but <hi>eye-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi>; and he giveth them but <hi>eye-wages.</hi> Indeed God can neither be <hi>deceived,</hi> nor <hi>deceive:</hi> yet as they would deceive God in their <hi>service,</hi> with such <hi>obedience</hi> as falleth short of <hi>true obedience</hi>; so they are deceived in their <hi>pay</hi> from him, with such <hi>blessings</hi> as fall short of <hi>true blessings.</hi> And all this may well stand with Gods both <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi>

               <hi>One generation passeth, and another co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth</hi> after it, there is not <hi>another</hi> City, or Nation, or People than there was before, but <hi>the same.</hi> If then the people of the same land should <hi>in this generation</hi> be visited with any such <hi>spiritual judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as is the removal of their <hi>Candlestick,</hi> and the want of <hi>the Gospel,</hi> for the sinnes and impieties of <hi>their Ancestors</hi> in some <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer generations</hi>: yet this ought no more to be accounted the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of <hi>one</hi> for <hi>another</hi>; than it ought to be accounted the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of <hi>one</hi> for <hi>another,</hi> to punish a man in his <hi>old age,</hi> for the sinnes of his <hi>youth.</hi> For as <hi>the body</hi> of a man, though <hi>the primitive moysture</hi> be continually spending and wasting therein, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay be still repaired by a daily supply of new and <hi>alimentall moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,</hi> is yet truly <hi>the same body</hi>; and as a <hi>River</hi> fed with a living

            <p>Again secondly; <hi>The want of the Gospel,</hi> is not properly a <hi>spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> but rather a <hi>temporal</hi> punishment.<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> We call it indeed some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a <hi>spiritual Iudgement,</hi> as we do the free use of it a <hi>spiritual Blessing</hi>: because <hi>the Gospel</hi> was written for, and revealed unto the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Church, by <hi>the Spirit</hi> of GOD; and also because it is <hi>the holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance</hi> of GOD, and the proper instrument whereby (ordinarily) <hi>the Spiritual</hi> life of <hi>Faith</hi> and of <hi>Grace</hi> is conveyed into our soules. But yet properly &amp; primarily, those only are <note n="(a)" place="margin">Ephes. 1.3.</note> 
               <hi>Spiritual blessings,</hi> which are immediately <hi>wrought</hi> in the soul by <hi>the spirit of God,</hi> and by the same <hi>Spirit</hi> cherished and <hi>preserved</hi> in the heart of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver for his good, and are <hi>proper</hi> and peculiar to those that are born again of <hi>the spirit</hi>: and all those on the contrary, which may be subject to <hi>decay,</hi> or are <hi>common</hi> to the reprobate with the Elect, or may turn to <hi>the hurt</hi> of the receiver, are to be esteemed <hi>temporal</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> blessings, and not spiritual. And such a <hi>blessing,</hi> is the outward <hi>partaking of the word</hi> and Ordinances of GOD: <hi>the want</hi> thereof therefore consequently, is to be esteemed a <hi>temporal judgement,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>spiritual.</hi> So that, notwithstanding <hi>this instance,</hi> still the former consideration holdeth good: that GOD sometimes visiteth the sins of <hi>the fathers</hi> upon the children with <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>temporal,</hi> but never with <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> punishments.</p>
            <p>Now, if there could no more be said to this doubt,<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> but only this; it were sufficient to clear <hi>Gods Iustice</hi>: since we have been already instructed, that these <hi>temporal judgements</hi> are not alwayes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
               <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> the punishments of sinne. For as <hi>outward bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings</hi> are indeed no true blessings <hi>properly</hi>; because <hi>Wicked</hi> men have their portion in them as well as <hi>the Godly,</hi> and they may turn (and often do) to <hi>the greater hurt</hi> of the soul, and so become rather <hi>Punishments,</hi> than <hi>Blessings</hi>: so to the contrary, <hi>outward punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> are no true punishments <hi>properly</hi>; because <hi>the Godly</hi> have their share in them as deep as <hi>the Wicked,</hi> and they may turn (and often do) to <hi>the greater good</hi> of the soul, and so become rather <hi>Blessings,</hi> than <hi>Punishments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be yet said;<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> But why then doth God threaten them as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>Punishments,</hi> if they be not so? I answer. <hi>First</hi>; because they <hi>seem</hi> to be punishments, and are by most men so <hi>accounted</hi> for their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> grievousnesse, though they be not properly such in themselves. <hi>Secondly</hi>; for <hi>the common event</hi>; because <hi>ut plurimùm</hi> and for the most part they prove <hi>punishments</hi> to the sufferer, in case he be not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

            <p>And <hi>first</hi>; It is considerable,<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> that <hi>Children</hi> most times tread in their Fathers <hi>steps,</hi> and continue in their <hi>sinnes</hi>: and so draw upon themselves their <hi>punishments.</hi> And this they doe especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by a <hi>three-fold</hi> conveyance of sinne from their Parents; <hi>viz.

that other <hi>outward</hi> one: and he telleth them <hi>the cause</hi> of the mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is superfluity of crude and noysom <hi>humours,</hi> ranknesse of <hi>bloud,</hi> abundance of <hi>melancholy,</hi> tough <hi>flegm,</hi> or some other like thing within.

            <p>And the same resolution is to be given to the other <hi>two doubts</hi> proposed in the beginning:<note place="margin">§ 32.</note> to that, Why GOD should punish any <hi>one</hi> man for <hi>another</hi>? and to the third, Why God should pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>

               <hi>Gifts,</hi> than by our <hi>Inclinations.</hi> The <hi>other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> is; because our <hi>Inclinations</hi> cannot so well produce <hi>Abilities,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as these can draw on <hi>them.</hi> We say indeed, there is nothing hard to a <hi>willing mind</hi>: and in some sense, it is true.

But <hi>Abilities</hi> can <hi>produce</hi> Inclinations <hi>de novo</hi>; and <hi>make</hi> them, where they <hi>find</hi> them not. As we see, every other natural thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> is <hi>inclinable</hi> to the exercise of those natural <hi>faculties,</hi> that are in it: so certainly would every man have strongest <hi>inclination</hi> to those things, whereto he hath strongest <hi>abilities,</hi> if wicked and unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>affections</hi> did not often corrupt our <hi>inclinations,</hi> and hinder them from moving their own proper and natural way.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> which without <hi>Abilities</hi> will not serve the turn.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 36.</note>Concerning which <hi>gifts</hi> or <hi>abilities</hi>; what they <hi>are,</hi> and how to make true <hi>judgement</hi> of them, and how to frame <hi>the choice</hi> of our Callings from them: to speak punctually and fully, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a large discourse. I can but touch at some few points <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> therein, such as are of daily use; and proceed. <hi>First,</hi> by <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>abilities</hi> we are to understand not only those of <hi>the Minde</hi>; Judgement, Wit, Invention, Memory, Fancy, Eloquence, &amp;c. and those of <hi>the Body</hi>; Health, Strength, Beauty, Activity, &amp;c. but also those which are <hi>without</hi>; Birth, Wealth, Honour, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Reputation, Kinred, Alliance, &amp;c. generally <hi>any thing,</hi> that may be of <hi>use</hi> or <hi>advantage</hi> unto us for any employment. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as our <hi>abilities</hi> on the one side, so on the other side all our <hi>wants</hi> and <hi>defects,</hi> which might disable us more or lesse for any em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, are to be duly weighed and considered of: and the one laid against the other; that we may know how to make as near as we can a <hi>just estimate</hi> of our strength and sufficiency. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it is the safer way to <hi>undervalue,</hi> than to <hi>overprise</hi> our selves: lest ignorantly confident, we affect a <hi>Calling</hi> above our <hi>strength</hi>; which were to <hi>flye</hi> with <hi>waxen wings,</hi> and to owe the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> world a laughter. Be we sure of this: if God have not <hi>gifted</hi> us <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> for it, he hath not <hi>called</hi> us to it. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> in the judging of our Abilities, we should have a regard to the outward <hi>circumstances</hi> of <hi>times</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> and the rest. Those <hi>gifts,</hi> which would have made a sufficient <hi>Priest,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>the Reformation,</hi> in that dearth of learning, and penury of the Gospel; now the times are full of knowledge and learning, would be all little enough for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> a <hi>Parish-Clerk. Fifthly,</hi> something would be yeelded to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>other men</hi> concerning our Abilities. It is either secret <hi>pride,</hi> or base <hi>faintness</hi> of heart, or dull <hi>sloath,</hi> or some other thing,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and not true <hi>modesty</hi> in us: if being excellently gifted for some weighty employment in every other mans judgement, we yet withdraw our selves from it with pretensions of unsufficiency. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> and lastly; let us resolve on that course, (<hi>caeteris paribus</hi>;) not only for which we are <hi>competently</hi> fit, but for which we are <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely</hi> fittest. A good Actor it may be could very sufficiently act any part in the play; represent the majesty of a <hi>King,</hi> or the humour of a <hi>Swaggerer,</hi> or the pranks of a <hi>Bedlam,</hi> or any thing: but yet if he be notedly excellent at some part rather than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he would not willingly be put from that, to act another.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
               <hi>Ergo histrio hoc videbit in scenâ, quod non videbit sapiens in vitâ?</hi> Shame we to let these men be wiser in their generations, than we in ours. And thus much for <hi>Abilities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is yet a doubt remaineth concerning a mans <hi>Inclination.</hi> In case we have examined our gifts,<note place="margin">§. 37.</note> and find them in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:64019:159"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of competency for such or such a course, and yet remain still <hi>averse</hi> from it, and cannot by any possible means work over our <hi>affections</hi> to any tolerable liking of it: in such a case, what is to be done, or how shall we judge what <hi>Calling</hi> is fittest for us to take? whether that whereto our <hi>Abilities lead</hi> us, or that whereto our <hi>Inclinations draw</hi> us. As I conceive it, in such a case, we are to hold this order. <hi>First,</hi> if our <hi>Inclinations</hi> cannot be wonne over to that course, for which our <hi>Abilities</hi> lye fittest; we are to take a second surview of our <hi>Abilities,</hi> to see if they be <hi>competently fit</hi> for that whereto our <hi>inclination</hi> swayeth us: and if upon due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> examination we find they are, we may then <note n="(a)" place="margin">

Perhaps some have taken it so: but certainly the Apostle never meant it so. For taking the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> word [<hi>Calling</hi>] in that extent wherein he treateth of it in this Chapter; if that were his meaning, he should consequently teach that no <hi>single man</hi> might marry, nor any <hi>servant</hi> become free: which are apparently contrary, both unto common <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and unto the very <hi>purpose</hi> of the Chapter. But taking the word as we have hitherto <hi>specially</hi> intended it, and spoken of it, for some setled <hi>Station</hi> and <hi>Course of Life,</hi> whereby a man is to <hi>maintain</hi> himself, or wherein to doe profitable service to <hi>humane society,</hi> or both: is it yet lawfull for a man to <hi>change</hi> it, or is he bound to <hi>abide</hi> in it perpetually without any <hi>possibility</hi> or <hi>liberty</hi> to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> alter his course upon any terms?

For where a man cannot warrantably climb unto an <hi>higher,</hi> but by the steps of <hi>an inferiour Calling</hi>; there must needs be supposed a lawfullness of relinquishing the inferiour. How should we doe for <hi>Generals</hi> for the wars, if <hi>Colonels</hi> and <hi>Lieutenants</hi> and <hi>Captains</hi> and common <hi>Souldiers</hi> might not relinquish their charges? and how for <hi>Bishops</hi> in the Church; if <hi>beneficed-men</hi> and <hi>College-Governours</hi> were clench't and riveted to their <hi>Cures,</hi> like a nail in a sure place, not to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> be removed?

If we are to <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mat. 5.29, 30.</note> cut off our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
               <hi>right hand,</hi> and to pluck out <hi>the right eye,</hi> and to cast them both from us, when they <hi>offend us</hi>: much more then ought we to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our selves <hi>the use</hi> of such outward <hi>lawfull things,</hi> as by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we have <hi>found,</hi> or have otherwise cause to suspect to be hurtfull either to our <hi>bodies,</hi> or <hi>souls.</hi> So a man may, and should refrain from <hi>meats,</hi> which may endanger his <hi>bodily health</hi>: But how much more then from every thing, that may endanger <hi>the health</hi> of his <hi>soul</hi>? If thou findest thy self enflamed with <hi>lust,</hi> by dancing; if enraged with <hi>choler</hi> by game; if tempted to <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, pride, uncleannesse, superstition, cruelty,</hi> any sin, by reason <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of any of <hi>the Creatures:</hi> it is better for thee to make a covenant with thine <hi>eyes</hi> and <hi>ears,</hi> and <hi>hands,</hi> and <hi>sences</hi> (so far as thy <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>calling</hi> will warrant thee) not to have any thing to doe with such things: than by gratifying them therein, cast both thy self and them into hell.

            </p>

               <note place="margin">§. 26.</note> reacheth to <hi>our brethren</hi> also: of whom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> we are to have a due <hi>regard</hi> in our use of <hi>the Creatures.</hi> An argument wherein St. <hi>Paul</hi> often enlargeth himself: as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. the whole Chapters throughout, and in a great part of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. The resolution every where is, that <note n="(b)" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.26.</note>

               <hi>all things indeed are pure, yet it is evil for that man which useth them with offence</hi>: that albeit <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> and other things be lawfull, yet <note n="(e)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid. vers.</hi> 21.</note> 
               <hi>it is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to doe any thing whereby a mans brother stumbleth, or is offended,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> or is made weak.</hi> Hitherto appertaineth that great and difficult common-place of <hi>scandal,</hi> so much debated and disputed of by Divines. <hi>The Questions</hi> and <hi>Cases</hi> are manifold; not now to be rehearsed, much less resolved, in <hi>particular</hi>: But <hi>the Position</hi> is plain in <hi>the general,</hi> that in case of <hi>scandal,</hi> for our <hi>weak brothers</hi>

Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, let this be our <hi>Sixth position</hi>; The determination of <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours</hi> may and ought to restrain us in the outward exercise of our <hi>Christian liberty.</hi> We must <note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.13, 15, 16.</note>

            <p>And the first <hi>Inference</hi> may be, shall I say for <hi>Triall</hi>; or may I not rather say, for <hi>Conviction</hi>? since we shall learn thereby,<note place="margin">§. 43.</note> not so much to <hi>examine</hi> our <hi>Thankfulness,</hi> how true it is; as to <hi>discover</hi> our <hi>unthankfulness,</hi> how foule it is.

               <hi>Perfection</hi> or <hi>Innocency.</hi> You would think by that word, that <hi>Abimelech</hi> had in this whole businesse walked in the sight of God with a <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>upright,</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>single,</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> heart. But alas, he was far from that. God <note n="h" place="margin">Ver. 17.18.</note> 
               <hi>plagued</hi> him and his, for that he had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> done: and <hi>God</hi> doth not use to punish <hi>the carcasse</hi> for that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>the heart</hi> is single. Again, God <hi>with-held</hi> him, or else he would have done more and worse: and it is a poor <hi>perfection</hi> of heart; where <hi>the active power</hi> only is restrained, and not <hi>the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward corruption</hi> subdued. Besides, <hi>Sarah</hi> was taken into the house, and there kept for <hi>lewd purposes</hi>: and how can truth and purity of heart consist with a <hi>continued resolution</hi> of sinful uncleannesse? <hi>Abimelech</hi> then cannot be defended, as truly and absolutely <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>: though he plead <hi>Innocency,</hi> and God himself bear witnesse to <hi>the Integrity</hi> of his heart. For had his heart been upright in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> him and sincere, in this very matter of <hi>Sarah,</hi> he would never have taken her into his house at all, as he did. But that he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for himself is; that in this <hi>particular,</hi> wherewith it seemed to him <hi>God</hi> by so threatning him did charge him, in <hi>wronging Abraham</hi> by taking his wife from him, his conscience could wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <hi>the Innocency</hi> of his heart; how free he was from any the least injurious <hi>purpose</hi> or so much as <hi>thought,</hi> that way. It was told him by them both, that she was his <hi>Sister</hi>; and he knew no other by her than so, when he took her into his house, supposing her to be a <hi>single Woman:</hi> if he had known she had been any mans <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
               <hi>Wife,</hi> he would not for any good have done <hi>the man</hi> so foul an injury, nor have sinned against his own <hi>soul,</hi> by defiling anothers bed: <hi>In the integrity of his heart, and innocency of his hands</hi> he did, what he had done. This is the <hi>substance</hi> of his allegation: and <hi>God</hi> approveth <hi>the integrity of his heart</hi> so far; <hi>viz.</hi> as free in this particular from any intent, either to <hi>injure Abraham,</hi> or to
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:64019:191"/>
               <hi>sin</hi> against the light of his own Conscience, by committing <hi>adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with anothers wife.</p>
            <p>The meaning of the words thus cleared: we may observe in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> them <hi>three</hi> things. <hi>First, the fact</hi> for which <hi>Abimelech</hi> pleadeth; and that was, the <hi>taking</hi> of <hi>Sarah,</hi> who was anothers wife, into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> his house. <hi>Secondly, the ground</hi> of his plea; and that was his <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance:</hi> he knew not when he took her, that she was anothers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> wife. <hi>Thirdly, the thing</hi> he pleadeth upon that ground; and that was his <hi>Innocency</hi> and <hi>the Integrity</hi> of his heart. Each of these <hi>three</hi> will afford us some observable <hi>instruction</hi> for our use. And <hi>the first thing</hi> we will insist upon from these words shall be, <hi>The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> grievousnesse of the sin of Adultery,</hi> hatefull even in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those men, who made small or no conscience at all of <hi>Fornication.</hi> See how this is raised from the Text. <hi>Abimelechs heart</hi> never smote him for taking <hi>Sarah</hi> into his house, so long as he supposed her to be but a <hi>single Woman:</hi> led with the common <hi>blindnesse</hi> and <hi>custome</hi> of the Gentiles, he either <hi>knew</hi> not, or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered</hi> not, that such <hi>fornication</hi> (though in a King) was a Sin. But the very frame of his <hi>Apology</hi> sheweth, that if he had <hi>known</hi> her to be <hi>another mans Wife</hi>; and yet had <hi>taken</hi> her, he could not then have pretended <hi>the integrity</hi> of his heart, and <hi>the innocency</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of his hands, as now he doth, and God alloweth it: but he should have been <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>For our clearer understanding of which point, (that I may not wade farther into that great <hi>question</hi> so much mooted among Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, than is pertinent to this story of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and may be usefull for us thence, <hi>viz.</hi> whether or no, or how far, <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Errour</hi> may <hi>excuse,</hi> or lessen sinful Actions proceeding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, in point of Conscience,) let us first lay down one general, certain, and <hi>fundamental ground,</hi> whereupon indeed dependeth especially <hi>the resolution</hi> of almost all those difficulties, that may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> occur in this, and many other like Questions. And that is this. It is a condition so essential to every <hi>sin</hi> to be <hi>Voluntary</hi>; that all other circumstances and respects laid aside, every <hi>sin</hi> is simply and absolutely by so much <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>lesser,</hi> by how much it is <hi>more</hi> or <hi>lesse</hi> voluntary. For whereas there are in the reasonable soul <hi>three</hi> prime faculties, from whence all humane Actions flow; <hi>the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, the Will,</hi> and <hi>the sensual Appetite</hi> or Affections: all of these concur indeed to every Action <hi>properly</hi> Humane; yet so, as <hi>the Will</hi> carrieth the greatest sway, and is therefore the justest mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of <hi>the Moral goodnesse,</hi> or <hi>badnesse</hi> thereof. In any of <hi>the three</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> there may be a fault, all of them being depraved in the state of <hi>corrupt Nature</hi>; and the very truth is, there is in every sin (every <hi>compleat sin</hi>) a fault in every of <hi>the three.</hi> And therefore <hi>all sins,</hi> by reason of <hi>the blindnesse</hi> of the Understanding, may be called <hi>Ignorances</hi>; and by reason of <hi>the impotency</hi> of the Affections, <hi>Infirmities</hi>; and by reason of the <hi>perversenesse</hi> of the will, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions.</hi> But for the most part it falleth out so, that although all <hi>the three</hi> be faulty, yet <hi>the obliquity</hi> of the sinful Action spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth most immediately and chiefly from <hi>the special default</hi> of some one or other of <hi>the three.</hi> If the main defect be in <hi>the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> From this <hi>Principle</hi> do issue sundry material <hi>conclusions</hi>: and namely, amongst many other, most pertinently to our purpose these <hi>two.

In him there was <hi>a twofold Error</hi>; and thence also <hi>a twofold Ignorance. The one</hi> was an Error <hi>in universali, (Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantia Iuris,</hi> as they call it;) concerning the nature of <hi>Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which being an <hi>heynous sin,</hi> he took to be either <hi>none</hi> at all, or a very <hi>small</hi> one. <hi>The other</hi> was an error <hi>in particulari, (Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantia facti,</hi>) concerning the personal condition and relation of <hi>Sarah</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi>: whose <hi>sister</hi> he thought her to be, and not <hi>wife,</hi> though she were <hi>both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That former Ignorance (<hi>Ignorantia juris</hi>) in <hi>Abimelech,</hi> was in some degree <hi>voluntary.</hi> For <hi>Abimelech</hi> had in him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Principles of <hi>the Law of nature</hi>; by the light whereof, if he had been careful to have improved it, but even so far as <hi>right reason</hi> might have led a prudent and dispassionate <hi>naturall man,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> he might have discerned in the most <hi>simple Fornication</hi> such <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity</hi> with those Principles, as might have sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced him of <hi>the unlawfulnesse</hi> thereof. It is presumed, that all <hi>Ignorance</hi> of that, which a man is <hi>bound</hi> to know, and <hi>may</hi> know if he be not wanting to himself, is so far forth <hi>wilful.</hi> Now <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi> was <hi>bound</hi> to know, that all <hi>carnal knowledge</hi> of man and woman out of the state of <hi>Wedlock</hi> was simply <hi>unlawful</hi>; and so much, if he had not been wanting to himself in the use of his <hi>Naturals,</hi> he <hi>might</hi> have known: and therefore it was a kinde of <hi>wilful ignorance</hi> in him in some degree, that he did not know <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> it. And therefore further, he cannot be <hi>wholly</hi> excused from sin, in <hi>taking Sarah,</hi> notwithstanding both <hi>that,</hi> and his <hi>other</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: for although he did not know her to be <hi>Abrahams wife,</hi> yet he knew well enough she was not <hi>his own wife</hi>; and being not so to <hi>him,</hi> whatsoever she was to <hi>Abraham</hi> it skilled not, he should certainly not have <hi>taken</hi> her. To plead <hi>Ignorance,</hi> that
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:64019:194"/>
he knew not <hi>Fornication</hi> to be a <hi>sin,</hi> would little help him in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> this case. For men must know, they stand answerable unto God for their <hi>Actions</hi>; not meerly according to the present <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> they <hi>actually</hi> have: but according to the <hi>knowledge</hi> which they <hi>ought</hi> and <hi>might</hi> to have had, those <hi>means</hi> considered, which he had afforded them of knowledge. Those <hi>means,</hi> even where they are scantest, being ever <hi>sufficient,</hi> at the least thus farre, <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 1.20.</note>

            <p>That <hi>Error</hi> then did not <hi>wholly</hi> excuse <hi>Abimelech</hi> from sin; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his <hi>Ignorance</hi> was <hi>partly</hi> wilful: yet we may not deny, but even that <hi>error</hi> did lessen and <hi>extenuate</hi> the sinfulnesse of the Action something, and so <hi>excuse</hi> him in part: <hi>a tanto,</hi> though not <hi>a toto.</hi> Because it appeareth by many evidences, that his <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> therein was not <hi>grosly affected</hi> and wilful: and look how much <hi>measure</hi> you abate in <hi>the wilfulnesse,</hi> so much <hi>weight</hi> you take off from <hi>the sin.

These respects make his <hi>wilfulnesse</hi> lesse, his <hi>ignorance</hi> more pardonable, and his <hi>sin</hi> more excusable. And I make no question, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises considered, but that <hi>Abrahams sin</hi> in denying <hi>Sarah</hi> to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> his wife (notwithstanding <note n="c" place="margin">Vers. 12.</note> the <hi>equivocating</hi> trick he had to help it) was by many degrees <hi>greater,</hi> than was <hi>Abimelechs</hi> in <hi>taking</hi> her: as being done more <hi>against knowledge,</hi> and therefore more <hi>wilfully. Abimelechs sin</hi> in taking her, though with some degrees of <hi>wilfulnesse,</hi> being yet a sin rather of <hi>Ignorance</hi>: whereas <hi>Abrahams sin</hi> in denying her, was a sin of <hi>Infirmity</hi> at the least, if not much rather a sin of <hi>Presumption.</hi>

            <p>Now although this <hi>former Errour (Ignorantia Iuris,)</hi> could not <hi>wholly</hi> excuse <hi>Abimelech</hi> from sin in what he had done, but <hi>in part</hi> only; for he sinned therein, by giving way to <hi>unchaste</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the least <hi>injurious</hi> intent against <hi>Abraham,</hi> in that kinde and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: and therefore though he took <hi>his wife</hi> from him indeed, yet not knowing any such matter by her, especially having with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all made ordinary and requisite <hi>enquiry</hi> thereafter, it must be granted he did it <hi>unwittingly,</hi> and therefore <hi>unwilfully:</hi> and therefore also <hi>unsinfully,</hi> as to that <hi>species</hi> of sin.

It is clear from the words of my Text, that <hi>Abimelechs</hi> heart was sincere in this action of taking <hi>Sarah,</hi> from any injury intended to <hi>Abraham</hi> therein; although <hi>de facto</hi> he took his wife from him: because he did it <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly.</hi>

            <p>By what hath been spoken we may see in part, what kinde of <hi>Ignorance</hi> it is, that will <hi>excuse</hi> us from sin, either <hi>in whole,</hi> or <hi>in part</hi>; and what will not. Let us now raise some profitable <hi>Inferences</hi> from this observation. <hi>First,</hi> our <hi>Romish</hi> Catholiques <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> often twit us with our fore-elders, [<hi>What,</hi> say they, <hi>were they not all down-right Papists? believed, as we believe? worshipped, as we worship? You will not say, they all lived and dyed in Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and so are damned. And if they were saved in their faith, why may not the same faith save us? and why will not you also be of that religion that brought them to Heaven?</hi>] A motive more <hi>plausible, than strong:</hi> the Vanity whereof our <hi>present Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> duly considered and rightly applyed fully discovereth. We have much reason to conceive good hope of <hi>the salvation</hi> of many of our <hi>Fore-fathers:</hi> who led away with <hi>the common superstitions</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of those blinde times, might yet by those <hi>general truths,</hi> which by the mercy of God were <hi>preserved</hi> amid the foulest overspread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Popery,</hi> agreeable to the Word of God, (though clogged with an <hi>addition</hi> of many superstitions and <hi>Antichristian</hi> inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions withal,) be brought to true <hi>Faith</hi> in the Son of God; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned <hi>Repentance</hi> from dead works; and a sincere desire and endeavour of new and holy <hi>Obedience.</hi> This was <hi>the Religion,</hi> that brought them to Heaven; even <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> This is <hi>the true,</hi> and <hi>the Old,</hi> and <hi>Catholique</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: and this is <hi>our Religion,</hi> in which we hope to finde <hi>sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and if ever any of you that miscal your selves <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques</hi> come to Heaven, it is <hi>this Religion</hi> must carry you thither. If together with this true Religion, of <hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> they embraced also your <hi>additions,</hi> as their blinde guides then led them; prayed to our <hi>Lady,</hi> kneeled to an <hi>Image,</hi> crept to a <hi>Cross,</hi> flocked to a <hi>Mass,</hi> as you now do: these were
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:64019:195"/>

               <hi>stubble</hi>; these were their <hi>Errors</hi> and their <hi>Ignorances.</hi> And I doubt not, but as S. <hi>Paul</hi> for his blasphemies and persecutions, so they <hi>obtained mercy</hi> for these sins, because they did them <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly</hi> in misbelief. And upon the same ground, we have cause also to hope charitably of many thousand poor souls in <hi>Italy, Spain,</hi> and other parts of the Christian World at this day: that by the same blessed means they may obtain <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> in the end, although in the mean time through <hi>ignorance</hi> they defile themselves with much foul <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and many gross <hi>Superstitions.</hi>

            <p>But <hi>the Ignorance</hi> that excuseth from sin, is <hi>Ignorantia facti,</hi> according to that hath been already declared: whereas theirs was <hi>Ignorantia juris,</hi> which excuseth not. And besides, as they <hi>lived</hi> in the practise of that worship which we call <hi>Idolatry,</hi> so they <hi>dyed</hi> in the same <hi>without repentance</hi>: and so their case is not the same with Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> who <hi>saw</hi> those his sins, and <hi>sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed</hi> for them, and <hi>forsook</hi> them: But how can <hi>Idolaters,</hi> living and dying so <hi>without repentance,</hi> be saved? It is answered, that <hi>ignorance</hi> in point of <hi>fact,</hi> so conditioned as hath been shewed, doth so excuse <hi>à toto</hi>; that an <hi>Action</hi> proceeding thence, though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it have a <hi>material inconformity</hi> unto the Law of God, is yet not <hi>formally a sin.</hi> But I do not so excuse <hi>the Idolatry</hi> of our Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as if it were not <hi>in it self</hi> a sin, and that (without repentance) <hi>damnable.</hi> But yet their <hi>Ignorance</hi> being such as it was: nourished by <hi>Education, Custom, Tradition, the Tyranny</hi> of their leaders, <hi>the Fashion</hi> of the times, not without some shew also of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; and themselves withall, having such slender <hi>means</hi> of better knowledge: though it cannot <hi>wholly excuse</hi> them from <hi>sin</hi> without repentance <hi>damnable,</hi> yet it much <hi>lesseneth</hi> and <hi>qualifieth</hi> the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of their <hi>Idolatry</hi>; arguing that their continuance therein <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> was more from other <hi>prejudices,</hi> than from a <hi>wilful contempt</hi> of Gods holy Word and Will. And as for their <hi>Repentance,</hi> it is as certain, that as many of them as are <hi>saved,</hi> did <hi>repent</hi> of their <hi>Idolatries,</hi> as it is certain no <hi>Idolater,</hi> nor other sinner can be saved without <hi>Repentance.</hi> But then, there is a <hi>double difference</hi> to be observed, between Repentance for <hi>Ignorances,</hi> and for <hi>known sins. The one</hi> is, that <hi>known sins</hi> must be confessed, and repented of, and pardon asked for them <hi>in particular,</hi> every one singly by it self, (I mean for <hi>the kindes,</hi> though not ever for <hi>the individuals,</hi>) every <hi>kinde</hi> by it self, at least where God alloweth time and leisure to <hi>the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Penitent,</hi> to call himself to a <hi>punctual</hi> examination of his life past, and doth not by <hi>sudden death,</hi> or by some <hi>disease</hi> that taketh away the use of reason deprive him of opportunity to do that: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as for <hi>Ignorances,</hi> it is enough to wrap them up all together in a <hi>general</hi> and <hi>implicite</hi> confession, and to crave pardon for them by

               <hi>Who can understand all his Errors? Lord, cleanse thou me from my secret sins.] The other</hi> difference is, that <hi>known sins</hi> are not truly repented of, but where they are <note n="b" place="margin">Prov. 28.13.</note>

            <p>But why then may not I, will some <hi>Popeling</hi> say, continue as I am, and yet come to heaven, as well as they continued what they were, and yet went to heaven? If I be an <hi>Idolater,</hi> it is out of my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>

Do this then my beloved Brethren.

               <hi>The Reason</hi> of which <hi>moral integrity</hi> in men unregenerate and meerly <hi>natural,</hi> is that <hi>Imperium Rationis,</hi> that power of <hi>natural Conscience</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> which it hath, and exerciseth over the whole man: doing the office of a <hi>Law-giver,</hi> and having the strength of a <hi>law</hi>; [<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 2.14.</note> 
               <hi>They are a law unto themselves,</hi>] saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. As a Law, it <hi>prescribeth,</hi> what is to be done: as a Law, it <hi>commandeth,</hi> that what is prescribed be done: as a Law, it <hi>proposeth</hi> rewards and punishments, accordingly as what it <hi>prescribeth</hi> and <hi>commandeth</hi> is done or not done. <hi>Abimelechs</hi> own <hi>Reason,</hi> by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> light of Nature <hi>informed</hi> him, that to take <hi>another mans wife</hi> from him was injurious; and <hi>enjoyneth</hi> him therefore, as he will avoid the horrors and upbraidings of a condemning heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by no means to do it. Resolved accordingly to do, and to obey <hi>the law of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> written in his heart, before he durst take <hi>Sarah</hi> into his house, he maketh <hi>inquiry</hi> first, whether she were <hi>a single woman</hi> or a wife: and therefore, although (upon mis-information) he <hi>took</hi> another mans wife, <hi>unwitting</hi> that she was so, he pleadeth here, and that justly, <hi>the integrity of his heart.</hi> And from obedience to the same <hi>Law</hi> especially, spring those many rare examples of <hi>Iustice, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Gratitude, Beneficence,</hi> and other <hi>moral vertues,</hi> which we read of in <hi>Heathen</hi> men, not without admiration: which were so many strong evidences also of this <hi>moral integrity</hi> of their hearts.</p>

               <hi>David</hi> on the other side, enflamed with lust after <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> whom he knew to be another mans Wife: <hi>plotting</hi> first, how to <hi>compasse</hi> his filthy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires with <hi>the Wife,</hi> and then after how to <hi>conceal</hi> it from <hi>the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> by many wicked and politick fetches; and, when none of those would take, at last to have him <hi>murthered,</hi> being one of his principal <note n="b" place="margin">2 Sam. 23.39.</note>

When we should see and consider all this on both sides, and lay the one against the other: what could we think but that <hi>Abimelech</hi> were the Saint, and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> the Infidel; <hi>Abimelech</hi> the man after Gods own heart, and <hi>David</hi> a stranger from <hi>the Covenant</hi> of God?

               <hi>the law</hi> of sinful <hi>concupiscence,</hi> may bewray much foul <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> and infidelity. But look into the more <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant course</hi> of both their lives: and then may you finde the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite and the unbeleever wholly <hi>distinguished</hi> from the godly, by the want of those right <hi>marks of sincerity</hi> that are in the godly: no <hi>zeal</hi> of Gods glory; no <hi>sense</hi> of original corruption; no <hi>bemoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> of his privy hypocrisie and secret Atheisme; no <hi>suspicion</hi> of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the deceitfulnesse of his own heart; no <hi>tendernesse of Conscience</hi> in smaller duties; no faithful <hi>dependence</hi> upon the providence or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God for <hi>outward things</hi>; no <hi>self-denial,</hi> or poverty of spirit; no <hi>thirst</hi> after the salvation of his brethren, and the like: none of these I say, to be found in any <hi>constant</hi> manner in the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral course</hi> of his life; although there may be some sudden light <hi>flashes</hi> of some of them now and then in some <hi>particular Actions.</hi> Measure no mans heart then, especially not thine own, by those rarer discoveries of moral integrity in <hi>particular actions</hi>: but by the powerful manifestations of <hi>habitual grace,</hi> in the more <hi>constant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> tenor</hi> of life and practise.</p>
            <p>We may learn hence <hi>thirdly,</hi> not to flatter our selves too much upon every <hi>integrity of heart</hi>; or to think our selves <hi>discharged</hi> from sin in the sight of <hi>God,</hi> upon every <hi>acquital</hi> of our own <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences:</hi> when as all this may befall an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> an <hi>Unbeleever,</hi> a <hi>Reprobate.</hi> When men <hi>accuse</hi> us of hypocrisie or unfaithfulnesse, or <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 35.11.</note>

The <hi>Points</hi> then that arise from this part of my Text, are these. 1. Men do <hi>not always</hi> commit those evils, their own <hi>desires,</hi> or outward <hi>temptations</hi> prompt them unto. 2. That they do it not, it is from <hi>Gods restraint.</hi> 3. That <hi>God restraineth</hi> them, it is of his own gracious goodness and <hi>mercy.</hi> The common subject <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the whole <hi>three points,</hi> being one, <hi>viz. Gods restraint of mans sin</hi>; we will therefore wrap them up all <hi>three</hi> together, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> so handle them, in this <hi>one</hi> entire <hi>Observation,</hi> as the <hi>total</hi> of all three. <hi>God in his mercy oftentimes restraineth men from commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting those evils, which, if that restraint were not, they would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise have committed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Restraint,</hi> whether we consider <hi>the Measure,</hi> or <hi>the Means</hi> which God useth therein; is of great variety. For <hi>the Measure</hi>; God sometimes <hi>restraineth</hi> men <hi>à Toto,</hi> from <hi>the whole sin,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they are tempted; as he with-held <hi>Ioseph</hi> from consenting to the perswasions of his Mistress: sometimes only <hi>à Tanto,</hi> and that more or less, as in his infinite wisdom he seeth expedient; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
               <hi>suffering</hi> them perhaps but only to <hi>desire</hi> the evill, perhaps to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve</hi> upon it, perhaps to <hi>prepare</hi> for it, perhaps to begin to <hi>act</hi> it, perhaps to <hi>proceed</hi> far in it, and yet keeping them back from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into <hi>the extremity</hi> of the sin, or accomplishing their whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire in the full and final <hi>consummation</hi> thereof; as here he dealt with <hi>Abimelech. Abimelech</hi> sinned against <hi>the eighth</hi> Commandement, in taking <hi>Sarah</hi> injuriously from <hi>Abraham,</hi> say he had been but her brother; and he sinned against <hi>the seventh</hi> Commandement in a foul degree, in harbouring such wanton and <hi>unchaste thoughts</hi> concerning <hi>Sarah,</hi> and making such way as he did, (by taking her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> into his house,) for <hi>the satisfying</hi> of his <hi>lust</hi> therein: but yet God <hi>with-held</hi> him from plunging himself into <hi>the extremity</hi> of those sins, not suffering him to fall into <hi>the act</hi> of uncleanness. And as for <hi>the Means</hi> whereby God with-holdeth men from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; they are also of wonderful <hi>variety.</hi> Sometimes he taketh them off, by <hi>diverting</hi> the course of the corruption, and turning <hi>the affections</hi> another way.

            </p>
            <p>And as to <hi>the third point</hi> in the Observation, it is not much lesse evident than the two former; namely, that this <hi>Restraint,</hi> as it is from God, so it is from <hi>the Mercy</hi> of God. Hence it is that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> usually bestow upon it the name of <hi>Grace</hi>: distinguishing between a <hi>twofold</hi> Grace; a <hi>special renewing</hi> Grace, and a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon restraining</hi> Grace. The <hi>special</hi> and <hi>renewing</hi> Grace is indeed so incomparably more excellent, that in comparison thereof the other is not worthy to be called by the name of <hi>Grace,</hi> if we would speak properly and exactly: but yet the word [<hi>Grace</hi>] may not
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:64019:203"/>
unfitly be so <hi>extended,</hi> as to reach to every act of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> whereby at any time he <hi>restraineth</hi> men from doing those evils which otherwise they would do; and that in a <hi>threefold</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>themselves,</hi> of <hi>others. First,</hi> in respect of <hi>God,</hi> every <hi>restraint</hi> from sin may be called <hi>Grace</hi>; in as much as it proceedeth <hi>ex mero motu,</hi> from the meer good will and <hi>pleasure of God,</hi> without any cause, motive, or inducement in the man that is so restrained. For take a man in the state of <hi>corrupt nature,</hi> and leave him to himself; and think, how it is possible for him to <hi>forbear</hi> any sin, whereunto he is tempted. There is no <hi>power</hi> in nature, to <hi>work</hi> a restraint: nay there is not so much as any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
               <hi>pronenesse</hi> in nature, to <hi>desire</hi> a restraint: much lesse then is there any <hi>worth</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> to <hi>deserve</hi> a restraint. Issuing therefore, not at all from <hi>the Powers of Nature,</hi> but from <hi>the free pleasure of God,</hi> as a <hi>beam</hi> of his <hi>merciful providence,</hi> this <hi>Restraint</hi> may well be called <hi>Grace.</hi> And so it may be <hi>secondly,</hi> in respect of the <hi>Persons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> because, though it be not available to them for their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting salvation; yet it is some <hi>favour</hi> to them, more than they have deserved, that by this means their <hi>sins</hi> (what in <hi>number,</hi> what in <hi>weight</hi>) are so much <hi>lesser,</hi> than otherwise they would have been; whereby also their <hi>account</hi> shall be so much <hi>the easier,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> their <hi>stripes</hi> so many <hi>the fewer</hi>: <note n="a" place="margin">

               </note> Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> often obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it, as an effect of <hi>the mercy</hi> of God upon them, when he cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth off great offenders betimes with some speedy destruction: and he doth it out of this very consideration, that they are thereby <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented</hi> from committing many sins, which if God should have lent them a longer time, they would have committed. If his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation be sound; it may then well passe for a <hi>double Mercy</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to a sinner, if he both <hi>respite</hi> his destruction, and withall <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain</hi> him from sin: for by <hi>the one,</hi> he giveth him so much longer time for repentance, which is <hi>one Mercy</hi>; and by <hi>the other,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> so much of the increase of his sin, which is <hi>another Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Thirdly,</hi> it may be called <hi>Grace,</hi> in respect of <hi>other men.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> For in <hi>restraining</hi> men from doing evil, God intendeth, as principally his own <hi>glory,</hi> so withall <hi>the good</hi> of mankinde, especially of his <hi>Church,</hi> in the preservation of <hi>humane so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi>: which could not subsist an hour, if every man should be left to <hi>the wildenesse</hi> of his own nature, to do what mischief, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and his own heart would put him upon, without restraint.

God here restrained <hi>Abimelech</hi>; as elsewhere he did <hi>Laban,</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> and <hi>Balaam,</hi> and others: not so much for <hi>their own</hi> sakes, though perhaps sometimes that also; as for <hi>their sakes,</hi> whom they should have injured by their sins, if they had acted them. As here <hi>Abimelech</hi> for his chosen <hi>Abrahams</hi> sake; and <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> for his servant <hi>Iacobs</hi> sake; and <hi>Balaam</hi> for his people <hi>Israels</hi>

            </p>
            <p>We see now <hi>the Observation</hi> proved in all the points of it. 1. Men do not alwaies <hi>commit</hi> those <hi>evils,</hi> they would, and might do. 2. That they do not, it is from <hi>Gods restraint,</hi> who <hi>with-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> there is a root of <hi>Pride</hi> in us all, whereby we are apt to think <hi>better</hi> of our selves, than there is cause: and every <hi>infirmity</hi> in our brother, (which should rather be an <hi>item</hi> to us of our frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) serveth as <hi>fuel</hi> to nourish this vanity, and to <hi>swell</hi> us up with a <hi>Pharisaical</hi> conceit, that forsooth we are <note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 18.11.</note> 
               <hi>not like other men.</hi> Now, if at any time, when we see any of our brethren <hi>fall</hi> into some sin, from which by the good hand of God upon us we have <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> been hitherto <hi>preserved,</hi> we then feel this <hi>swelling</hi> begin to rise in us, as sometimes it will do: the point already delivered may stand us in good stead, to <hi>prick</hi> the bladder of our <hi>pride,</hi> and to let out some of that <hi>windy vanity</hi>; by considering, that this our <hi>forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> of evill, wherein we seem to excell our brother, is not from <hi>nature,</hi> but from <hi>grace</hi>; not from our <hi>selves,</hi> but from <hi>God.</hi> And here a little let me close with thee, whosoever thou art, that pleasest thy self with <hi>odious comparisons,</hi> and standest so much upon terms of <hi>betternesse</hi>; thou art neither <hi>Extortioner,</hi> nor <hi>adulterer, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard,</hi> nor <hi>swearer, thief, slanderer,</hi> nor <hi>murtherer</hi>; as such and such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> are. It may be thou are none of these: but I can tell thee what thou art, and that is as odious in the sight of God as any of these: thou art a <hi>proud Pharisee,</hi> which perhaps they are not. To let thee see thou art a <hi>Pharisee,</hi> do but give me a direct <hi>answer,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shifting or mincing, to that <hi>Question</hi> of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>

All the shift thou hast, is to say it was <hi>God</hi> indeed that made <hi>the difference,</hi> but he saw something <hi>in thee</hi> for which he made thee <hi>to differ:</hi> thou acknowledgest his <hi>restraint</hi> in part, but thine own <hi>good nature</hi> did something.

               <hi>Lastly,</hi> since this <hi>Restraint</hi> whereof we have spoken, may be but a <hi>common Grace,</hi> and can give us no sound nor <hi>solid comfort</hi> if it be but a <hi>bare restraint,</hi> and no more: though we ought to be <hi>thankful</hi> for it, because we have <hi>not deserved</hi> it; yet we should not rest, nor think our selves safe enough, till we have a well grounded assurance, that we are possessed of an higher and a better grace, even <hi>the grace of sanctification.</hi> For <hi>that</hi> will <hi>hold out</hi> against temptations, where <hi>this</hi> may <hi>fail.</hi> We may deceive our selves then, (and thousands in the world do so deceive themselves;) if upon our <hi>abstaining</hi> from sins, from which God <hi>with-holdeth</hi> us, we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> presently conclude our selves to be in <hi>the state of Grace,</hi> and to have <hi>the power</hi> of godlinesse, and <hi>the spirit</hi> of sanctification. For, between this <hi>restraining Grace,</hi> whereof we have now spoken, and that <hi>renewing Grace</hi> whereof we now speak; there are sundry wide <hi>differences.</hi> They differ <hi>first,</hi> in their <hi>fountain.

               <hi>God,</hi> whereof it is said in the Psalm, that <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 145.</note> 
               <hi>his mercy is over all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> his works.</hi> They differ <hi>secondly,</hi> in their extent: both of <hi>Person, Subject, Object,</hi> and <hi>Time.</hi> For <hi>the Person; restraining</hi> Grace is <hi>common</hi> to good and bad: <hi>Renewing</hi> Grace <hi>proper</hi> and peculiar to the <hi>Elect.</hi> For <hi>the Subject; Restraining Grace</hi> may binde <hi>one part</hi> or faculty of a man, as <hi>the hand</hi> or <hi>tongue,</hi> and leave <hi>another</hi> free, as <hi>the heart</hi> or <hi>ear: Renewing Grace</hi> worketh upon <hi>all</hi> in some measure, sanctifieth the whole man, <note n="b" place="margin">1 Thes. 6.23.</note> 
               <hi>Body, and soul, and spi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rit,</hi> with all the parts and faculties of each. For <hi>the Object; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining Grace</hi> may withhold a man from <hi>one sin,</hi> and give him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> scope to <hi>another: Renewing Grace</hi> carrieth an <hi>equal</hi> and just respect to all Gods Commandements.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> destitute. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> they differ in their <hi>Ends. Restraining Grace</hi> is so intended chiefly for the good of <hi>humane society,</hi> (especially of <hi>the Church of God,</hi> and of the members thereof;) as that indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently it may, or may not do good to <hi>the Receiver</hi>; but <hi>Renewing Grace</hi> is especially intended for the Salvation of <hi>the Receiver,</hi> though <hi>Ex consequenti</hi> it do good also unto others.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <hi>fourthly,</hi> and lastly, in their <hi>Effects. Renewing Grace mortifieth</hi> the corruption, and <hi>subdueth</hi> it, and <hi>diminisheth</hi> it; as <hi>water</hi> quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth fire, by abating the heat: but <hi>Restraining Grace</hi> only <hi>inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth</hi> the exercise of the corruption, for the time, without any <hi>real diminution</hi> of it either in substance or quality; as <hi>the</hi>

               <hi>fire</hi> wherein the <hi>three Children</hi> walked, had as much <hi>heat</hi> in it at that very instant, as it had before and after, although by the greater power of God, the natural power of it was then <hi>suspended</hi> from working upon <hi>them.</hi> The <hi>Lions</hi> that spared <hi>Daniel</hi> were Lions still, and had their ravenous disposition still; albeit God <note n="d" place="margin">Dan. 6.22.</note>

               <hi>breaking their bones</hi> before they came to the ground.

            </p>
            <p>But he no where presseth it more fully than in this Chapter: Wherein after <hi>the general</hi> exhortations of <hi>subduing the lusts</hi> that are in their own bosoms, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. and of <hi>ordering their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi> so as might be for their credit and honesty in the sight of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> others, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. when he descendeth to more <hi>particular duties,</hi> he beginneth <hi>first</hi> with, and insisteth <hi>most</hi> upon this duty of <hi>subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and obedience</hi> to authority, in the greatest remaining part of the Chapter. <hi>The first Precept</hi> he giveth in this kinde, is set down with sundry amplifications and reasons thereunto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the next <hi>verses</hi> before the Text <hi>(Submit your selves to every Ordinance of man for the Lords sake:)</hi> And then he doth by way of <hi>Prolepsis,</hi> take away <hi>an objection,</hi> which he foresaw would readily be made against that and the following Exhortations, from the pretext of <hi>Christian liberty:</hi> in the words of the Text <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>(<hi>As free and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.</hi>)</p>

               <hi>give place by subjection, no not for an hour</hi>; lest we be <hi>ensnared</hi> by our own default, ere we be aware.

               <hi>deceive, spoil or beguile us</hi>: as if it were <hi>in our power,</hi> if we would but use requisite care thereunto, to prevent it; and as if it were <hi>our fault</hi> most, if we did not prevent it.

The most and worser sort, unconsciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, do often transgresse this way.

like respects, they become <hi>officious instruments</hi> to others for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> accomplishing of their lusts in such <hi>services,</hi> as are evidently (even to their own apprehensions) sinful and wicked.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> And as these English words, and the Latine word <hi>malitia</hi> whence these are borrowed; so likewise <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in Greek, is many times used to signifie <hi>one special kinde</hi> of sin, which is directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to brotherly love and charity: and the word is usually so taken, wheresoever it is either set in opposition to such <hi>charity,</hi> or else ranked with other special sins of the same kinde, such as are <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 1.29; Col. 3.8; Tit. 3.3.</note> 
               <hi>anger, envie, hatred,</hi> and the like.

               </gap> and <hi>malus,</hi> from whence the substantive used in the Text is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived. Of which <hi>maliciousnesse</hi> so largely taken, that <hi>special mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse</hi>
               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:64019:217"/>
before spoken of, is but a branch. The Apostles full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> then in this clause of <hi>the text,</hi> is to restrain all that abuse of <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> whereby it is made a <hi>cloak</hi> for the palliating of any wicked or sinful practise in any kinde whatsoever. And so understood, S. <hi>Peters</hi> admonition here is parallell'd with S. <hi>Pauls</hi> elsewhere; <hi>Brethren</hi> (saith he) <hi>you have been called unto liberty: only use not your liberty for an occasion to the flesh, Gal.</hi> 5.15.

            <p>For the proof whereof I shall need to use no other arguments,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> than the words of <hi>the Text</hi> will afford. First every act of <hi>malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse</hi> is a sin: and secondly to <hi>cloak</hi> it with a fair pretence, maketh it a greater sin: but then thirdly to use <hi>Christian liberty</hi> for the cloak, giveth a farther addition to it, and maketh it a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sin.

               <hi>naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do</hi>; this <hi>cloaking</hi> of our sins is but a farther evidence of our <hi>hypocrisie</hi> in his sight: who as he is a God of <hi>pure eyes,</hi> and therefore cannot but hate <hi>all sin</hi>; so is he a God that loveth a <hi>pure heart,</hi> and therefore of all sins hateth <hi>hypocrisie.</hi> They that by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice and oppression devour widows houses, shall certainly receive <hi>damnation</hi> for that, but if withall they do it under the colour of devotion and of <hi>long prayers,</hi>

in others <hi>the very use</hi> of some <hi>lawful things.</hi> And many times <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> again, because there is evidently a <hi>lawful use</hi> of the things, we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently <hi>justifie</hi> our selves in the very <hi>abuses</hi> also. That is foolish <hi>preciseness</hi> in us; and this prophane <hi>partiality:</hi> by that we <hi>infringe</hi> our brethrens liberty; by this <hi>pollute</hi> our own.

            <p>But is not this to <hi>preach</hi> one thing, and <hi>do</hi> another? ought not our <hi>Doctrine</hi> and our <hi>Practice</hi> to go together? It is most true, they ought so to do: Neither doth any thing I have said make to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the contrary.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> are so far pressed, as if men were bound in conscience to obey them, which taketh away <hi>the freedom of the conscience:</hi> for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f the conscience be bound, how is she free? Nor so only, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <hi>fourthly,</hi> the things so enjoyned are by consequence imposed upon us as of <hi>absolute necessity</hi> unto salvation: forasmuch as it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary unto salvation for every man to do that which he is bound in conscience to do; by which device <hi>kneeling</hi> at the Communion, <hi>standing</hi> at the Gospel, <hi>bowing</hi> at the name of Jesus, and the like, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> become to be of <hi>necessity</hi> unto salvation. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> say they, these Constitutions cannot be defended but by such arguments as <hi>the Papists</hi> use for the establishing of that their rotten Tenet, that <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> laws binde the conscience</hi> as well as divine. Then all which premises, what can be imagined more contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ious to true <hi>Christian liberty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which <hi>Objections</hi> (before I come to their particular answer) I cannot but observe the unjust (I would we might not say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conscionable) <hi>partiality</hi> of the Objecters. <hi>First,</hi> in laying the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> against <hi>the Ecclesiastical laws</hi> only: whereas their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (if they had any strength in them) would as well conclude against <hi>the Political laws</hi> in the civil State, and against <hi>domestical <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> orders</hi> in private Families, as against <hi>the Laws Ecclesiastical:</hi> yet must these only be guilty, and they innocent, which is not equal. Let them either <hi>damn</hi> them all, or <hi>quit</hi> them all: or else let them shew wherein they are unlike, which they have not yet done, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> can do. <hi>Secondly,</hi> when they condemn the things enjoyned as
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:64019:220"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
               <hi>simply</hi> and <hi>utterly unlawful</hi> upon quite other grounds; and yet keep a stir about <hi>Christian liberty:</hi> for which argument there can be no place without supposal of <hi>indifferency,</hi> (for Christ hath left us no <hi>liberty</hi> to unlawful things,) how can they answer this their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest partiality? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if they were put to speak upon their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> consciences, whether or no, if <hi>power</hi> were in their own hands, and <hi>Church affairs</hi> left to their ordering, they would not <hi>forbid</hi> those things they now dislike, every way as <hi>strictly</hi> and with as much <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of necessity,</hi> as the Church presently <hi>enjoyneth</hi> them; I doubt not but they would say <hi>Yea:</hi> and what equity is there in this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> dealing, to <hi>condemn</hi> that in <hi>others,</hi> which they would <hi>allow</hi> in <hi>themselves? Fourthly,</hi> in some things they are content to submit to <hi>the Ecclesiastical Constitutions</hi> notwithstanding their <hi>Christian <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> liberty,</hi> which <hi>liberty</hi> they stiffely pretend for their refusal of other some: whereas the case seemeth to be every way equal in both; all being enjoyned by <hi>the same authority,</hi> and for <hi>the same end,</hi> and in <hi>the same manner.</hi> If their <hi>liberty</hi> be impeached <hi>by these</hi>; why not as much <hi>by those?</hi> or if obedience <hi>to those</hi> may consist with <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian liberty</hi>; why not as well obedience <hi>to these?</hi> In allowing some, rejecting others, where there is the same reason of all: are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> they not very partial?</p>
            <p>And now I come to answer their <hi>arguments,</hi> or rather <hi>flourishes,</hi> for they are in truth no better. That <hi>first</hi> allegation, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining of any thing <hi>in unam partem</hi> taketh away a mans <hi>liberty</hi> to it, is not true. For <hi>the liberty</hi> of a Christian to any thing indifferent consisteth in this; that his <hi>judgement</hi> is throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of <hi>the indifferency</hi> of it: and therefore it is the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the judgement, in <hi>the opinion</hi> of the thing, not in <hi>the use</hi> of it, that taketh away <hi>Christian liberty.</hi> Otherwise not only <hi>Laws</hi> Political and Ecclesiastical: but also all <hi>Vows, Promises, Covenants, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Contracts,</hi> and what not, that pitcheth upon any certain resolution <hi>de futuro,</hi> should be prejudicial to <hi>Christian Liberty</hi>: because they do all <hi>determine</hi> something <hi>in unam partem,</hi> which before was free and indifferent <hi>in utram<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> partem.</hi> For example: if my friend invite me to sup with him, I may by no means <hi>promise</hi> him to come; because <hi>the liberty</hi> I had before to go or not to go, is now <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined</hi> by making such a <hi>promise</hi>: neither may a young man bind himself an Apprentice, with any certain <hi>Master,</hi> or to any certain <hi>trade,</hi> because <hi>the liberty</hi> he had before of placing himself indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently with that <hi>Master,</hi> or with another, and in that <hi>trade,</hi> or in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> another, is now <hi>determined</hi> by such a <hi>contract.</hi> And so it might be instanced in a thousand other things. For indeed to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose hath God left indifferent things <hi>determinable</hi> both ways by <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> if they may never be <hi>actually determined</hi> either way, without impeachment of that <hi>liberty?</hi> It is a very vain <hi>power,</hi> that may not be brought into <hi>act</hi>; but God made no <hi>power</hi> in
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:64019:221"/>
vain. Our Brethren I hope will wave this <hi>first argument,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> when they shall have well examined it: unless they will frame to themselves under the name of <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> a very <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera,</hi> a <hi>non ens,</hi> a meer <hi>notional liberty,</hi> whereof there can be no use.</p>
            <p>That which was alleaged <hi>secondly,</hi> that they that make such <hi>Laws</hi> take upon them <hi>to alter the nature of</hi> things, by making <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> things to become <hi>necessary,</hi> being said <hi>gratis</hi> without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>truth</hi> or <hi>proof,</hi> is sufficiently answered by the bare denyal. For they that make <hi>Laws</hi> concerning <hi>indifferent things,</hi> have no intention at all to meddle with <hi>the nature</hi> of them; they leave <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that <hi>in medio</hi> as they found it: but only for some reasons of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency to order <hi>the use</hi> of them; the indifferency of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture still being where it was. Nay, so far is <hi>our Church</hi> from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any intention of taking away <hi>the indifferency</hi> of those things which for order and comeliness she enjoyneth; that she hath by her publick <hi>declaration</hi> protested the contrary: wherewith they ought to be satisfieed. Especially since her sincerity in that declaration (that none may cavil, as if it were <hi>protestatio contraria facto,</hi>) appeareth by these <hi>two</hi> most clear evidences among many other; in that she <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> both alloweth <hi>different rites</hi> used in other Churches, and also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> teacheth her own rites to be <hi>mutable</hi>: neither of which she could do, if she conceived <hi>the nature</hi> of the things themselves to be <hi>changed,</hi> or their <hi>indifferency</hi> to be removed by her <hi>Constitutions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is that true, which was <hi>thirdly</hi> alleaged, that where men are bound in conscience to obey, there the <hi>conscience</hi> is not left <hi>free</hi>; or else there would be a contradiction. For there is no <hi>contradiction,</hi> where the affirmative &amp; negative are not <hi>ad idem,</hi> as it is in this case. For <hi>Obedience</hi> is one thing, and <hi>the Thing commanded</hi> another; The <hi>Thing</hi> is commanded by <hi>the Law of man,</hi> and in regard thereof the conscience is <hi>free:</hi> but <hi>Obedience</hi> to men is commanded by <hi>the Law of God,</hi> and in regard thereof the conscience is <hi>bound.</hi> So that we are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> bound in conscience to <hi>obedience</hi> in indifferent things lawfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; <hi>the conscience</hi> still remaining no less <hi>free</hi> in respect of <hi>the things</hi> themselves so commanded, then it was before. And you may know it by this; In Laws <hi>properly humane</hi> (such as are those that are made concerning <hi>indifferent</hi> things) the <hi>Magistrate</hi> doth not nor can say; This you are bound in conscienee to do, and therefore I command you to do it: as he might say, if <hi>the bond</hi> of obedience did spring from <hi>the nature</hi> of the things commanded. But now when <hi>the Magistrate</hi> beginneth at the other end, as he must do,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and saith, I command you to do this or that, and therefore you are bound in conscience to do it: this plainly sheweth, that <hi>the bond</hi> of obedience ariseth from that <hi>power</hi> in <hi>the Magistrate,</hi> and <hi>duty</hi> in <hi>the subject,</hi> which is of divine Ordinance. You may observe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that in <hi>humane Laws</hi> not meerly such (that is, such as are
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:64019:221"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> established concerning things simply <hi>necessary,</hi> or meerly <hi>unlawful</hi>;) the Magistrate may there derive <hi>the bond</hi> of obedience from the nature of <hi>the things</hi> themselves. As for example, if he should make <hi>a Law</hi> to inhibite <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> or <hi>Adultery</hi>; he might then well say, you are bound in conscience to abstain from these things, and therefore I command you so to abstain: which he could not so well say in <hi>the Lawes</hi> made to inhibit the eating of <hi>flesh,</hi> or the transportation of <hi>grain.</hi> And the reason of the difference is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: because those former Laws are rather <hi>Divine</hi> than <hi>humane (the substance</hi> of them being <hi>divine,</hi> and but <hi>the sanction</hi> only <hi>humane</hi>) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and so binde by their <hi>immediate vertue,</hi> and in respect of <hi>the things</hi> themselves therein commanded: which the later being meerly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane (both for <hi>substance</hi> and <hi>sanction</hi>) do not.</p>
            <p>The consideration of which difference and the reason of it, will abundantly discover the vanity of the <hi>fourth</hi> allegation also: wherein it was objected that the things enjoyned by <hi>the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Lawes</hi> are imposed upon men as <hi>of necessity</hi> to salvation: Which is most untrue. Remember once again, that <hi>obedience</hi> is one thing; and the <hi>things commanded</hi> another. <hi>Obedience</hi> to law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful authority is a duty commanded by God himself and in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Law, and so is a part of that <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 12.14.</note> 
               <hi>holinesse without which no man shall see God:</hi> but <hi>the things</hi> themselves commanded by lawful authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are neither in truth <hi>necessary</hi> to salvation, nor do they that are in authority <hi>impose</hi> them as such. Only they are the <hi>object</hi> (and that but <hi>by accident</hi> neither and <hi>contingently,</hi> not necessarily) about which that <hi>obedience</hi> is conversant, and wherein it is to be exercised. An example or two will make it plain. We know every man is bound in conscience to imploy himself in the works of his <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar calling</hi> with faithfulnesse and diligence; and that faithfulnesse and diligence is a branch of that <hi>holinesse</hi> and <hi>righteousnesse</hi> which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> is necessary unto salvation. Were it not now a very fond thing and ridiculous, for a man from hence to conclude, that therefore drawing of <hi>wine,</hi> or making of <hi>shooes,</hi> were necessary to salvation, because these are the proper imployment of the <hi>Vintners,</hi> and <hi>Shoomakers</hi> calling, which they in conscience are bound to follow, nor may without sin neglect them? Again, if a <hi>Master</hi> command his <hi>servant</hi> to <hi>go</hi> to the <hi>market,</hi> to <hi>sell</hi> his corn, and to <hi>buy</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for his house, or to <hi>wear</hi> a livery of such or such a colour and fashion: in this case who can reasonably deny but that <hi>the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> is bound in conscience to do the very things <hi>his master</hi> bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> him to do; to <hi>go,</hi> to <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll,</hi> to <hi>buy,</hi> to <hi>wear?</hi> and yet is there any man so forsaken of common sense, as thence to conclude, that <hi>going</hi> to market, <hi>selling</hi> of corn, <hi>buying</hi> of meat, <hi>wearing</hi> a blue coat, are <hi>necessary to salvation?</hi> or that <hi>the Master</hi> imposeth those things upon the servant as of <hi>necessity unto salvation?</hi> The obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of <hi>the servants conscience</hi> to do the things commanded ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:64019:222"/>
from the force of that <hi>divine Law</hi> which bindeth <hi>servants</hi> to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> obey their <hi>masters</hi> in lawful things. <hi>The master</hi> in the things he so commandeth, hath no particular <hi>actual respect</hi> to <hi>the conscience</hi> of his servant, (which perhaps all that while never came within his thoughts,) but meerly respecteth his own occasions and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. In this example as in a glasse let <hi>the Objectors</hi> behold the lineaments and feature of their own argument. Because <hi>kneeling, standing, bowing,</hi> are commanded by <hi>the Church,</hi> and the people are bound in conscience to obey <hi>the Lawes</hi> of the Church; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the Church</hi> imposeth upon the people <hi>kneeling, standing,</hi> and <hi>bowing,</hi> as <hi>necessary</hi> to salvation.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/>
            </p>
            <p>If that which they <hi>object</hi> were indeed true, and that <hi>the Church</hi> did impose these <hi>rites,</hi> and <hi>ceremonies</hi> upon the people, as <hi>of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to salvation,</hi> and require to have them so accepted: doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse <hi>the imposition</hi> were so prejudicial to <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> as that every faithful man were bound in conscience for the maintenance of that liberty, to <hi>disobey</hi> her authority therein, and to <hi>confesse</hi> against the imposition. But our <hi>Church</hi> hath been so far from any intention of doing that her self, that by her foresaid publick <hi>declaration</hi> she hath manifested her utter dislike of it in others. What should I say more? <note n="a" place="margin">

               <hi>Denique te ipsum concute.</hi> It would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> better become <hi>the Patriarchs</hi> of that party that thus deeply (but untruly) charge her; to look unto their own <hi>cloaks,</hi> dive into their own <hi>bosoms,</hi> and survey their own <hi>positions</hi> and <hi>practise:</hi> if happily they may be able to clear themselves of trenching upon <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> and ensnaring <hi>the consciences</hi> of their brethren, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon their <hi>Proselytes</hi> their own traditions of <hi>kneel not, stand not, bow not,</hi> (like those mentioned <hi>Col.</hi> 2. of <note n="b" place="margin">Col. 2.21.</note>

            <p>As for <hi>consent with the Papists</hi> in their doctrine concerning the power that <hi>mens lawes</hi> have over the conscience, which is <hi>the last</hi> objection: it ought not to move us.

They teach that <hi>Humane lawes,</hi> especially the <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> binde the consciences of men, not only in respect of <hi>the obedience,</hi> but also in respect of <hi>the things themselves</hi> commanded, and that by their own <hi>direct immediate</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> vertue.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> at home on the contrary, out of an appetite they have to bring in a new <hi>platform of discipline</hi> into the Church, and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to present <hi>the established government</hi> unto the eyes and the hearts of the people in as deformed a shape as they can; quarrel <hi>the Ecclesiastical lawes</hi> especially for tyrannizing over the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, but do not shew themselves so much agrieved at <hi>the secular.</hi> Whereas the very truth is, whatsoever advantages <hi>the secular</hi> powers may have above <hi>the Ecclesiastical,</hi> or <hi>the Ecclesiastical</hi> above <hi>the secular</hi> in other respects; yet as to the power of <hi>binding the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> conscience,</hi> all humane lawes in general are of like reason, and stand upon equal termes. It is to be misliked <hi>secondly</hi> in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> doctrine, that they subject the conscience to <hi>the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> also, and not only tye it to <hi>the obedience</hi>; whereby they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume unto themselves (<hi>interpretativè</hi>) the power of altering <hi>the nature</hi> of the things by removing of their <hi>indifferency,</hi> and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a <hi>necessity:</hi> for so long as they remain indifferent, it is certain they cannot binde. And <hi>thirdly</hi> and principally it is to be misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in them, that they would have this <hi>binding power</hi> to flow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> from the proper and inherent vertue of <hi>the Lawes</hi> themselves <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and <hi>per se</hi>; which is in effect to equal them with <hi>the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law</hi>: for what can that do more? whereas <hi>humane lawes</hi> in things not repugnant to <hi>the Law of God,</hi> do binde the conscience indeed to obedience, but it is by <hi>consequent,</hi> and by vertue of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Divine Law,</hi> commanding us in all lawful things to obey the superiour powers.</p>
            <p>But whether <hi>mediately</hi> or <hi>immediately,</hi> may some say, whether <hi>directly</hi> or <hi>by consequent,</hi> whether by its own or by a borrowed vertue; what is it material to be argued, so long as the same effect will follow, and that as intirely to all intents and purposes, the one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> way as well as the other? As if <hi>a debt</hi> be alike recoverable; it skilleth not much whether it be due upon <hi>the original bond,</hi> or upon an <hi>assignment.</hi> If they may be sure to be <hi>obeyed,</hi> the higher powers are satisfied: Let Scholars wrangle about <hi>words</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions</hi>; so they have <hi>the thing,</hi> it is all they look after.

controversie are not altogether of so great consequence as they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> have seemed to some.

            <p>The <hi>third</hi> and last general duty is <hi>Fidelity,</hi> (<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 24.45.</note> 
               <hi>Who is a faithful and wise servant?</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 25.21.</note> 
               <hi>Well done thou good and faithful servant.</hi>) As if both <hi>the wisdom</hi> and <hi>goodnesse</hi> of a servant consisted in <hi>his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse.</hi> Now the faithfulnesse of a servant may be tryed especially by these three things: By the <hi>heartinesse</hi> of his service, by being <hi>tender</hi> of his Masters honour and profit, and by his quicknesse and <hi>diligence</hi> in doing his businesse. A notable example whereof we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> have in <hi>Abrahams</hi> servant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. in all the three particulars. For <hi>first,</hi> being many miles distant from his Master, he was no lesse <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of the businesse he was <hi>put in trust</hi> withall, then he could have been, if he had been all that while <hi>in the eye</hi> of his Master. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> he framed himself in his speeches and actions, and in his whole behaviour to such a discreet carriage, as might best set forth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>the credit</hi> and honour of his Master. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he used all possible <hi>diligence</hi> and <hi>expedition</hi>; losing not any time, either at first for <hi>the delivery</hi> of his message, or at last for <hi>his return</hi> home after he had brought things to a good conclusion. Such <hi>faithfulnesse</hi> would well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> become us in <hi>the service of God</hi> in all the aforesaid respects.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> whereof is <hi>Heartinesse</hi> in his service. There are many <hi>servants</hi> in the world, that will work hard, and bustle at it lustily for a fit, and so long as their <hi>Masters eye</hi> is upon them; but when his back is turned, can be content to go on fair and softly, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-like.
