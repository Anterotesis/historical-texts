            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I confess, That those were impious and prodigious Popish Cruelties; yet
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52420:4"/>
such as were not absolutely and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately Pernicious, and destructive of the poor Persecuted Christians. For,</p>
            <p n="1">I. When Armies were raised to ruin them, they had some time to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult their Security, to Fight, (if they were able) if not, to Fly, and so preserve their Lives.</p>
            <p n="2">II. When they were caught, and call'd into the Inquisition, (and so to a seeming Legal Tryal) they had some time to make their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, at least to Pray, and make their Peace with Heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">III. And the Execution of those Cruelties, was upon particular Persons, in some Village, City, or Province.</p>
            <p>But the Hellish Gun-powder Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Conspiracy (we are now speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of) contrived by the impious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the Jesuits, (and their Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates) and to be executed by the pernicious violence of Gun-powder, would have been (had it taken the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52420:4"/>
design'd effect) a far more Secret and Sudden, a more Universal and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious Villany: All the Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Temporal, all the Commons and <hi>(horresco referens)</hi> the King Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Blown up, and so Murder'd in a moment: That is, Not some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Persons onely, but the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Assassinated; not <hi>in Effigie</hi> (as in some Countries, they hang Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors they cannot catch) but in its Real Representatives, the whole Parliament of <hi>England.</hi> A Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy so Inhuman and Barbarous, of such Diffusive and Universal Mischief, as (before that time) never was, nor would nor could have been Approv'd, Continu'd, and Executed, without Gunpowder and Jesuits. But for a more full Discovery of this Treason, I refer the Reader to the Book it self, and our publick <note n="a" place="margin">See the Acts above cited. 3 <hi>Iacobi. cap.</hi> 4. &amp; 5.</note> Acts of Parliament concerning it.</p>
            <p>Yet to give him some further Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and Reason, for the second Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Book, let him be pleased to know:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52420:5"/>
I. That since the Happy Discovery of the late Damnable and Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Conspiracy, (as the Two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Parliament truly <note n="b" place="margin">At a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of both Houses, <hi>Nov.</hi> 1. 1678.</note> call it) many Pious and Learned Persons, desirous to look back and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the particulars of the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder Plot (both Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies being hatch'd and hammer'd in the same Popish Forge, by the Jesuits and their Adherents) did diligently seek after this Book, I now publish; but (above 70 years being passed since the first Impression) they found it not; and therefore to satisfie their Desires, and supply that Defect, it was thought convenient, and (as the condition of the Kingdom now Stands, or Staggers) necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Re-print it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Though the Gun-powder Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy was hatch'd in Hell, and carry'd on with all the Sworn Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cresie, and Impious Policy imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; yet (there being no Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy against Providence, nor any
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52420:5"/>
Mischief so mysterious, as to be hid from that All-seeing Eye of him with whom we have to do) the most gracious and good God of Heaven and Earth, opportune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discovered that Traiterous Conspiracy, and (in great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) prevented the Mischief, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to his People. This was a Miraculous Mercy, never to be forgotten, but (with all grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) kept in perpetual Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, by our whole Nation. <hi>God hath so done his Marvellous Works,</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 111. 4. <hi>Vid.</hi> Esther 9. 28.</note> 
               <hi>THAT THEY OUGHT to be had in REMEMBRANCE.</hi> When God delivered his People out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he Instituted the Passover, as a Memorial, that they and their Children might for ever <note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 12. 24, 26, 27.</note> Remember it. And when our Blessed Saviour Redeem'd us from (more than <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage) the Slavery of Sin and Satan; he also Instituted a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, to help our Infirmity, and be a Memorial of his unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mercy—<note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 24, 25.</note> DO THIS IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52420:6"/>
All our Gracious God requires, or expects from us, is a Grateful Memory and Acknowledgement of his Mercies; which is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be done, if we forget them. Seeing then, that this Book contains an Authentique History of the great Misery and Mischiefs intended, and by Popish Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and Cruelty prepared for this Nation, and the unspeakable Mercy of our most Gracious God preventing it. It was thought fit to Reprint it, as a Memorial that Men might Read and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member these Mercies, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and Continue their Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for ever for them.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Another Reason why this Book was a second time Printed and Published, was, That all, (who had a Mind and Time to read it, without Partiality and Prejudice) might have Authentique Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to convince our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: who not only in remote Countreys beyond the Seas, but here in <hi>England,</hi> since His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties

Happy Return, (and in Print) do indeavor (with a strange Confidence, to give it no worse name) to persuade Men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That the Gun-powder Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy was no Popish Plot, but <hi>Cecil</hi>'s Contrivance. One of their late Scriblers says indeed, <hi>That it was A HORRID PLOT;</hi> but adds, <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Calendarium Catholicum:</hi> Or, <hi>An Universal Almanack,</hi> 1662. That's the Title. But by that word <hi>Catholicum,</hi> he means, a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Catholique or Popish Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack; for it is calculated only for the Meridian of <hi>Rome,</hi> and is not Catholique in any other sense.

               <hi>MORE THEN SUSPECTED, TO BE THE CONTRIVANCE OF</hi> CECIL, <hi>the great Polititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, to RENDER CATHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIQUES ODIOUS.</hi> He confesseth (in both places cited, as well he might) <hi>That SOME ROMAN-CATHOLIQUES were in that Plot.</hi> But there were
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52420:7"/>
but <hi>FEW DETECTED,</hi> and they that were <hi>Detected,</hi> were <hi>DESPERADO'S.</hi> So that he would have us believe, that it was not any Popish, but <hi>Cecils,</hi> (a Protestants) Contrivance, and those Popish Desperado's (as he calls them) who were detected in it, were by <hi>Cecil</hi> the Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, drawn into that Conspiracy, to make Catholiques odious. It is almost impossible, that any Man who is not resolv'd to believe, (or make others believe) a Lie, should profess and publish such evident Untruths, in matter of Fact, against the Sense of a whole Nation, and the publick Acts and Declarations of King, Lords, and Commons in a full Parliament. But (to me) it is no wonder, that they, who (for their mis-called Catholique Cause) have confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence enough, impiously to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, and (as far as they are able) Execute such Prodigious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies, against their King and Country, should have equal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to deny them, when
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52420:7"/>
(for want of success) they and their Unchristian Cause, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in such Denial. And here when this Popish Writer, (who otherwise was a Man of some Parts and Quality) says, <hi>That there were only A FEW Papists DETECTED in that Popish Powder Plot.</hi> I shall desire the Courteous and Impartial Reader to consider:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they were not so Few, as he pretends; as may evidently appear, by the following Book, which contains the Discovery, Conviction, and Condemnation, of those Popish Traitors.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And considering, That this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Conspiracy was Contrived and Carried on, with so great and sworn Secresie, taking Solemn Oaths, and the Sacrament upon them (never intended for such impious Purposes) to conceal that horrid Design, and their Practices in the prosecution of it: the wonder is not, that no more, but that so many were detected.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:52420:8"/>
3. But admit that a Few only, were Detected here in <hi>England,</hi> so as to apprehend, and (as they well deserv'd) execute them for their Treason: yet 'tis certain, that the damnable Powder Conspiracy was well known beyond Seas, to the Popish Party, (especially the Jesuits) long before the happy discovery of it: as out of <hi>Deltio,</hi> and some others of their own Writers has, and (when there is an opportunity) may be made Manifest.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When that Popish Calendar (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited) tells us, <note n="a" place="margin">In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer place quoted out of that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendarium Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>That the Papists in the Powder Treason and Conspiracy, were DESPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RADO'S, of a Religion which DETESTS such Treasons.</hi> And afterwards, <note n="b" place="margin">In the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place above cited out of that Calender.</note> 
               <hi>That all SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BER CATHOLIQUES ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly DETEST that, and ALL SUCH ABOMINABLE CONSPIRACIES.</hi> To this false Flourish, I shall only say,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:52420:8"/>
First, That I confess, and easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, that those Gunpowder Traitors, were indeed (what he calls them) <hi>DESPERADO'S,</hi> desperate Villains, else they would never have undertaken, or acted in a Design so black, and (as he truly calls it) Abominable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy, against their King and Native Country. And, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If the <hi>Gunpowder Plot,</hi> was an <hi>Abominable Conspiracy,</hi> and they who acted in it <hi>Desperado's,</hi> and <hi>not Sober Catholiques,</hi> (as that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor pretends, to excuse and free his Church from the Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Guilt of that Horrid and Damnable Conspiracy) then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly those Great and Learned Popish Writers are very much to blame, who in their Publique (and by their Party generally Approved) Writings, so highly commend those Gunpowder Traitors (and others of their Faction, justly Condemn'd and Executed for High Treason) and tell us, <hi>That they lived like SAINTS, and</hi> (although Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

to design and execute any Plot or Conspiracy, to Kill an Excommunicate King; whom they believe to be an Heretique, devested of Majesty, and all Royal Authority, and an Enemy to their Roman-Catholique Cause and Church. So that if they should miscarry in any such impious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign and Popish Conspiracy (as hitherto they have, and (by the Blessing of God) I hope they ever will) yet they know they shall be highly honor'd by all their Party, and be so far from having the Brand of Traytors (though the World well knows they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it) that they will pass for <hi>SAINTS,</hi> stand in red Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in their Roman Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, and be Magnified for <hi>Martyrs.</hi> This incouragement they have to any Plot or Conspiracy, (how impious soever) if it be against Heretiques, and for their Catholique Cause) from their received Principles, from their belief of the Popes vast Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and Infallibility, and their

Now this erroneous and impious (yet Roman Catholick) Doctrine, (so highly approved and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Rome,</hi> even by the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self) being granted; it is no wonder, if the Jesuits and the Popish Party securely design and endeavour the extirpation and utter ruine of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, (Kings or Subjects) and all those they call Hereticks, with Fire or Sword, Poison or Pistols, Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder Plots, and any Conspiracies. For, although such actions (to all sober men, even honest Pagans) are, and ever have been justly accounted prodigious Impieties; yet to the Jesuits and Popish Party they are not so. For 1. They are so far from believing such actions sinful, that when they are done out of zeal for their Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Cause, and with the approbation of their Superiors, (which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want) they are (in their esteem) <hi>virtuous,</hi> and (which is more) <hi>merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> as will appear hereafter. 2.

            <p>The premisses considered, I think we have very much (too much) reason to believe, that while there are Jesuits in <hi>England,</hi> Superiors (such as the Pope, their General, Provincial, &amp;c.) to command, and Inferiors to obey, it is impossible our Gracious King, or his Protestant Subjects should be safe, unless they repent, and renounce their impious Principles, and bloody Practises, (which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, whilst they believe those true, and these just) or the good God of Heaven and Earth do (as hitherto
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52420:22"/>
in great mercy he has) by a powerful Providence discover and defeat their Conspiracies. For as it is notoriously known to this, and other Nations; that during the times of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>Iames, Charles</hi> the Martyr, and our Gracious Soveraign now happily restored, they have impiously design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and indeavoured, by open War, by Poison and Pistol, Gun-powder Plots, and horrid Conspiracies, to destroy our Princes and our Religion; So we have little reason to doubt, but while there are such Persons, possess'd with a belief of such principles, they will continue to Design, and (when they have ability and opportunity) execute such damnable, and (to Protestant Princes and People) destructive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies. I would not wrong the meanest Jesuit (were it in danger) to save my life; nor will I conceal their principles (dangerous to our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and Religion) though (what I do not fear) I lose it. For this were basely to betray my Religion and my Countrey too; things which are, and (to all good men) ever should (and will) be more valuable than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

Lives. Give me leave therefore (courteous Reader) to add, not what I, but what the Jesuits say of themselves and Society. And here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Father <hi>Campian</hi> (who though hang'd at <hi>Tyburn</hi> for High Treason, yet at <hi>Rome</hi> is reputed a famous Martyr) tells us,— <note n="c" place="margin">Iesuitas OMNES in universo terrarum orbe, FOE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DUS, ad REGES Haereticos QUOVIS MODO TOLLEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOS, jam pridem iniisse.

            <p>And Father <hi>Creswel</hi> (if <hi>Hospinian</hi> cite him right, for in this place and time I have not the Book about me) in his <hi>Philopater,</hi> tells us, <hi>That ALL CATHOLICKS are to be so instructed, that when they have an opportunity to kill Hereticks, they should not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any impediment to hinder them.</hi> So that if you say, <hi>In

            <p>This Character of the Jesuits is none of mine, it is a Spanish History, not my calumny of them. I do, and shall pray for them, that if they be guilty of all, or some of this, (as I fear they are) God Almighty would be graciously pleased to give them true penitence and pardon too. What Answer they have given (or can give) to this accusation (which has been publick, and in print above 40 years) I know not, I have not yet heard of any. In the mean time, I shall desire the Reader to consider the quality of the Witnesses, who charge them with so many and enormous crimes. 1. They are no Protestants, (or any they do or dare call Hereticks) but Papists. 2. Nor they simple Persons, but Corporations, and Bodies of men.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52420:26"/>
3. Nor they Townsmen, and meer Laicks, so that it might be thought, they did it out of hatred or envy; according to the Gloss in their Canon Law, <hi>Laici sunt Clericis oppidò in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festi;</hi> but they are great and learned Bodies of men, Universities. 4. Nor some few of them, but many; All the Universities of a great Kingdom. 5. And that a most Catholick King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, very zealous for the Pope and Popery, to wit, <hi>Spain.</hi> 6. Nor is it any private Testimony, given in some particular Court, but publick, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to their King in print, and so to the World. 7. Lastly, they witness against persons they had great reason and opportunities to know, living amongst them, and having continual conversation with them, and so must needs be <hi>Testes idonei,</hi> most compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Witnesses against them. And therefore Protestants have very great reason and evidence to believe, that the Jesuits are such persons, as their own Party, by such Authentick Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies, prove them to be.</p>
            <p>The premisses considered, that is, the Principles, the Persons, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52420:26"/>
the Jesuits have to seek the ruine and destruction of all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, (Princes and People) the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Universities of <hi>Spain</hi> will (to all prudent men) seem very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, That persons of such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <hi>(Ab omnibus sunt cavendi, &amp; fugiendi,</hi> (I may add) <hi>fugandique)</hi> should be with all care and caution avoided, and banish'd out of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Countreys; it being morally impossible (as sad experience shews) they should enjoy peace and safety long, where such restless Spirits (en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and resolved to endeavour their ruine) do remain.</p>
            <p>But besides these (peculiar to the Jesuits) there are more and greater encouragements (common to them and all the Popish Party) to design and endeavour the extirpation of all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks (especially Protestants, who, in their account, (and truth) are most dangerous to their erroneous and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Novelties) and the ruine of the Protestant Religion.

            <p>And here I shall desire the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader to consider, 1. The
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52420:27"/>
excellency of the Reward, <hi>Grace here,</hi> and <hi>Glory hereafter.</hi> 2. Who it is that promises all this; the Pope, and a great, and (by them) approved General Council. 3. The assurance and certainty they may have of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying what's promised, arising from the Authority and Infallibility of the Pope and Council, who make the Promise; whose Authority and Judgment is, and to all Papists, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they will deny their received Principles) Supreme and Infallible. 4. And seeing so glorious a reward is (by such Authority) promis'd for murdering Hereticks, they may be assured, that the doing it is (at least) innocent and lawful; unless they will confess (which would overthrow the foundation of their Religion) that the Pope and General Council may be guilty of so great an error and impiety, as to promise Heaven for impious and unlawful actions, which neither do nor can deserve any thing but Hell and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. 5. Many things may be, and are lawful, which are not necessary, nor (in some times and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances)
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52420:28"/>
expedient. But this destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hereticks with Fire and Sword, (according to the Popish Principles) is not onely lawful, but a necessary duty, (which upon pain of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication and a Curse) they are bound to do. For (by the Decree of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> and his General Council) all Secular Supreme <note n="e" place="margin">COMPELLANTUR Potestates seculares cujuscun<expan>

a year, it was to be signified to the Pope, that he might presently depose them, and absolve their Subjects from their Oaths of Allegiance, and give away their Kingdoms to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, who would be bloody, obey the Pope, and destroy Hereticks.</p>
            <p>By the premisses it does (to me, and will, I believe, to many more) seem evident, that the murdering He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical, Protestant (for at <hi>Rome</hi> they are believ'd and declar'd Hereticks) Excommunicated Kings and Subjects, is not onely, 1. A <hi>lawful Action;</hi> but 2. in the judgment of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> a <hi>necessary duty,</hi> (at least in sometimes and cases) though to all other sober Christians a damnable sin: And 3. such a <hi>meritorious duty,</hi> as shall have <hi>remission of sins here,</hi> and a <hi>higher degree of Glory hereafter:</hi> 4. And the doers of it shall (in their Popish Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendars and Martyrologies) be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to posterity, not for (what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are) <hi>impious Murderers,</hi> but <hi>glorious Martyrs.</hi> Now how great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement such impious Principles and Promises may give those, who have faith enough to believe them,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52420:29"/>
to contrive and attempt any villany, for the Catholick Cause, and utter extirpation of all Protestants, (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes or People) times past are, and (unless the gracious and powerful Providence of Heaven pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it) future times may be sad wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. Certainly, traiterous and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Gun-powder Conspiracies, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering innocent Christians, (even Kings and Princes) <hi>causâ indictâ &amp; inauditâ,</hi> neither is, nor can be a just means to obtain Indulgences, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins, and the Crown of Martyrdom. Traitors may be Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, but surely no Martyrs: such villanies (however approv'd, and highly rewarded by the Pope and his Party) may be a Roman, but no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian way to Heaven. However, all those unhappily deluded Souls, who believe (as all the through-pac'd Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists do and must) the Pope and Councils Infallibility, and power to make good their promises, will (as hitherto they have) be willing to design and endeavour the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all Hereticks, (all Protestants to be sure, whether Kings or Subjects)
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52420:29"/>
either by raising Armies, open War and Rebellion, (when they have abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) or by Assassinations, by Pistol or Poison, or Gun-powder Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, when they have it not, (as I pray, and hope, they never will) I trust, that the infinitely wise and powerful Providence of God, which (for the time past) has graciously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served our Princes and Religion, and discovered and defeated all the black and impious Conspiracies of their Popish Enemies, will (for the future, if our ingratitude and impenitence do not hinder it) continue that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, to the comfort of his Church, and confusion of her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: Former favours thankfully received from God, being sure pledges and assurances of future.</p>
            <p>To conclude; When the impious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of <hi>Rome</hi> (which had been work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever since the Reformation) did not prosper; when they could not (though cunningly and constantly endeavour'd) either by Poison, Pistol, or open War, take away Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> to bring in <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotland;</hi> when they saw King <hi>Iames</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:52420:30"/>
in quiet possession of the Imperial Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and saw his Learning and Love to the truly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick and Apostolick Faith of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be such, that they despaired (as well they might) ever to be able to seduce him into a belief of their new <hi>Trent</hi> Creed, and Popish Superstitions: they had no more patience, <hi>(loesa patientia fit fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror)</hi> but resolv'd (by a new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Villany, a Gun-powder Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy) to take away and murder him, that seeing he would not be for their Religion, he should not be able to be against it. But that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased the despair of the Jesuits, and the Popish party, and their rage and fury against that good King, (their lawful Sovereign) was a solemn and pious <hi>Protestation,</hi> made by the <note n="a" place="margin">

The occasion of that Protestation was this, Some of the discontented Puritan party had set a foot a scandalous report of the King, <hi>THAT HE MEANT TO GRANT A TOLERATION TO POPERY.</hi> This highly offended his Majesty, and, in contradiction to it, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it, he publickly made this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn <hi>Protestation,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lords Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and you the Knights and Burgesses of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; It was far from my thoughts, till very lately, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my coming to this place, that this Subject should have been ministred unto me, whereupon I am now to speak. But now it so falleth out, That whereas in the preceding Session of this Parliament, the principal occasion of my Speech was, to thank and congratulate all you of this House, and in you, all the whole Common-wealth (as being the representative Body of the State)
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52420:33"/>
for your so willing, and loving receiving, and embracing of me in that place, which God and Nature by descent of Bloud, had in his own time provided for me: So now my subject is, to speak of a far greater Thanksgiving than before I gave to you, being to a far greater person, which is to GOD, for the great and miraculous Delivery he hath at this time granted to me, and to you all, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently to the whole Body of this Estate,</p>
                  <p>I must therefore begin with this old and most approved Sentence of Divinity, <hi>Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricordia Dei supra omnia opera ejus.</hi> For Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD did not furnish so great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his Glory, by the Creation of this great World, as he did by the Redemption of the same. Neither did his Generation of the little World, in our old and first ADAM, so much set forth the praises of GOD in his Justice and Mercy, as did our Regeneration in the last and second ADAM.</p>
                  <p>And now I must crave a little pardon of you, That since Kings are in the word of GOD it self called Gods, as being his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants and Vicegerents on earth, and so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned and furnished with some sparkles of the Divinity; to compare some of the Works of GOD the Great King, towards the whole and general World, to some of his Works to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Me, and this little world of my Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, compassed and severed by the Sea from the rest of the Earth. For as GOD for the just punishment of the first great Sinner in the original world, when the Sons of GOD
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52420:33"/>
went in to the Daughters of Men, and the cup of their iniquities of all sorts was filled, and heaped up to the full, did by a general deluge and overflowing of waters, baptize the World to a general destruction, and not to general purgation (only excepted <hi>Noah</hi> and his family, who did repent and believe the threatenings of God's judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:) So now, when the World shall wax old as a Garment, and that all the impieties and sins that can be devised against both the first and second Table, have, and shall be committed to the full measure; GOD is to punish the World the second time by Fire, to the general destruction and not purgation thereof. Although as it was done in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family by the waters; So shall all we that believe be likewise purged, and not destroyed by the Fire. In the like sort, I say, I may justly compare these two great and fearful Dooms-days, wherewith GOD threatened to destroy me, and all you of this little World that have interest in me. For although I confess, as all mankind, so chiefly Kings, , as being in the higher places like the high Trees, or stayest Mountains, and steepest Rocks, are most subject to the daily tempests of innumerable dangers; and I amongst all other Kings, have ever been subject unto them, not only ever since my birth, but even as I may justly say, before my birth, and while I was yet in my Mothers belly: yet have I been exposed to two more special and greater dangers than all the rest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52420:34"/>
The first of them, in the Kingdom where I was born, and passed the first part of my life: And the last of them here, which is the greatest. In the former, I should have been baptized in bloud, and in my destruction, not only the Kingdom, wherein I then was, but ye also by your future interest, should have tasted of my ruine. Yet it pleased GOD to deliver me, as it were, from the very brink of death, from the point of the dagger, and so to purge me by my thankful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of so great a benefit. But in this which did so lately fall out, and which was a destruction prepared not for me alone, but for you all that are here present, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in no rank, age, or sex should have been spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; This was not a crying sin of bloud as the former, but it may well be called a roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nay, a thundering sin of Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, from the which, God hath so miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously delivered us all. What I can speak of this, I know not: Nay rather, what can I not speak of it? And therefore I must for horror say with the Poet. <hi>Vox faucibus haeret.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this great and horrible attempt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">Three mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents be to be observed in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</note> the like was never either heard or read, I observe three wonderful, or rather miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous events.</p>
                  <p>First, in the cruelty of the Plot it self, wherein cannot be enough admired the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and fearful cruelty of their Device, <note place="margin">1 The cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Plot.</note> which was not only for the destruction of my Person, nor of my Wife and Posterity only, but of the whole Body of the State in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52420:34"/>
wherein should neither have been spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or distinction made of young nor of old, of great nor of small, of man nor of woman: The whole Nobility, the whole Reverend Clergy, Bishops, and most part of the good Preachers, the most part of the Knights and Gentry; yea, and if that any in this Society were favourers of their Profession, they should all have gone one way: The whole Judges of the Land, with the most of the Lawyers and the whole Clerks: And as the wretch himself that is in the Tower, doth confess, it was purposely devised by them, and concluded to be done in this house; That where the cruel Laws (as they say) were made against their Religion, both place and persons should all be destroyed and blown up at once. And then <note place="margin">Three ways how man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind may come to death.</note> consider therewithal the cruel form of that practice: for by three different sorts in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral may mankind be put to death.</p>
                  <p>The First, by other men, and reasonable creatures, which is least cruel: for then both <note place="margin">1. By Man.</note> defence of men against men may be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and likewise who knoweth what pity GOD may stirr up in the hearts of the Actors at the very instant? besides the many ways and means, whereby men may escape in such a present fury.</p>
                  <p>And the Second way more cruel than that, is by <hi>Animal</hi> and unreasonable creatures: for <note place="margin">2. By unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable creatures.</note> as they have less pity then men, so is it a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter horror, and more unnatural for men to deal with them: But yet with them both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance may avail, and also some pity may
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52420:35"/>
be had, as was in the Lyons, in whose Den <hi>Daxiel</hi> was thrown; or that thankful Lyon, that had the <hi>Roman</hi> slave in his mercy.</p>
                  <p>But the Third, which is most cruel and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful of all, is the destruction by insensible <note place="margin">3. By insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible things.</note> and inanimate things; and amongst them all, the most cruel are the two Elements of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Fire; and of those two the Fire most raging and merciless.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, How wonderful it is when you shall think upon the small, or rather no <note place="margin">2. The small ground the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors had to move them.</note> ground, whereupon the Practisers were enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to invent this Tragedy. For if these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators had only been bankrupt persons, or discontented upon occasion of any disgraces done unto them; this might have seemed to have been but a work of revenge. But for my own part, as I scarcely ever knew any of them, So cannot they alledge so much as a pretended cause of grief: And the wretch himself in hands doth confess, That there was no cause moving him or them, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and only Religion. And specially, that Christian men, at least so called, <hi>Englishmen,</hi> born within the Countrey, and one of the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials of them, my sworn Servant, in an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable place, should Practise the destruction of their King, his Posterity, their Countrey and all: wherein their following obstinacy is so joyned to their former malice, as the fellow himself that is in hand, cannot be moved to discover any signes or notes of repentance, except only, that he doth not yet stand to avow, that he repents for not being able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his intent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52420:35"/>
Thirdly, The discovery hereof is not a little <note place="margin">3. Miracu lous event, the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> wonderful, which would be thought the more miraculous by you all, if you were as well acquainted with my natural disposition, as those are who be near about me. For as I ever did hold suspition to be the sickness of a Tyrant, so was I so far upon the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, as I rather contemned all advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or apprehensions of practises. And yet now at this time was I so far contrary to my self, as when the Letter was shewed to me by my Secretary, wherein a general obscure ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verisement was given of some dangerous blow at this time, I did upon the instant inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret and apprehend some dark phrases there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, contrary to the ordinary Grammer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of them, (and in another sort then I am sure any Divine, or Lawyer in any Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity would have taken them) to be meant by this horrible form of blowing us up all by Powder; and thereupon ordered, that search to be made, whereby the matter was discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the man apprehended: whereas if I had apprehended or interpreted it to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort of danger, no worldly provision or prevention could have made us escape our utter destruction</p>
                  <p>And in that also, was there a wonderful providence of God, that when the party him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was taken, he was but new come out of his house from working, having his Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work for kindling ready in his pocket, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with as he confesseth, if he had been taken but immediately before, when he was in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52420:36"/>
House, he was resolved to have blown up himself with his Takers.</p>
                  <p>One thing for my own part have I cause to thank GOD in, That if GOD for our sins had suffered their wicked intents to have prevailed, it should never have been spoken nor written in ages succeeding, that I had died ingloriously in an Ale-house, a Stews, or such vile place, but mine end should have been with the most Honourable and best company, and in that most Honourable and fittest place for a King to be in, for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the turns most proper to his Office; And the more have We all cause to thank and magnifie GOD for this his merciful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery. And specially I for my part, that he hath given me yet once leave, whatsoever should come of me hereafter, to assemble you in this Honourable place; And here in this place, where our general destruction should have been, to magnifie and praise him for Our general delivery; That I may justly now say of mine enemies and yours, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> doth often say in the <hi>Psalm, Inciderunt in foveam, quam fecerunt.</hi> And since <hi>Scipio</hi> an <hi>Ethnick,</hi> led only by the light of Nature, That day when he was accused by the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> for mispend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wasting in his <hi>Punick</hi> wars the Cities Treasure, even upon the sudden brake out with that diversion of them from that matter, calling them to remembrance how that day, was the day of the year, wherein GOD hath given them so great a victory
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52420:36"/>
against <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and therefore it was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them all, leaving other matters, to run to the Temple to praise GOD for that so great delivery, which the people did all follow with one applause: How much more cause have we that are Christians to bestow this time in this place for Thansgiving to GOD for his great Mercy, tho we had had no other errand of assembling here at this time; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if I have spoken more like a Divine, than would seem to belong to this place, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it self must plead for mine excuse: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here come to thank God for a Divine work of his Mercy, how can I speak of this deliverance of us from so hellish a practise, so well, as in language of Divinity, which is the direct opposite to so damnable an intention? And therefore may I justly end this purpose, as I did begin it with this Sentence, <hi>The mercy of God is above all his works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It resteth now, that I should shortly inform you what is to be done hereafter upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of this horrible and strange accident. As for your part that are my faithful and loving Subjects of all degrees, I know that your hearts are so burnt up with zeal in this errand, and your tongues so ready to utter your dutiful affections, and your hands and feet so bent to concurr in the execution thereof, (for which as I need not to spurr you, so can I not but praise you for the same:) As it may very well be possible, that the zeal of your hearts shall make some of you in your speeches, rashly to blame such as may be innocent of this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52420:37"/>
But upon the other part I wish you to consider, That I would be sorry that any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing innocent of this practise, either domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or forrain, should receive blame or harm, for the same. For although it cannot be denied, That it was the only blind superstition of their errors in Religion, that led them to this desperate device; yet doth it not follow, That all professing that <hi>Romish</hi> Religion were guilty of the same. For as it is true, That no other sect of Heretiques, not excepting <hi>Turk Iew,</hi> nor <hi>Pagan,</hi> no not even those of <hi>Calicute</hi> who adore the Devil, did ever maintain by the grounds of their Religion, That it was lawful, or rather meritorious (as the <hi>Romish</hi> Catholicks call it) to murther Princes or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for quarrel of Religion. And although particular men of all professions of Religion have been some Thieves, some Murtherers, some Traitors, yet ever when they came to their end and just punishment, they confessed their fault to be in their nature, and not in their profession, (These <hi>Romish</hi> Catholicks only excepted:) Yet it is true on the other side, That many honest men blinded peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with some opinions of Popery, as if they be not found in the questions of the <hi>Real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> or in the number of the Sacraments, or some such School-question: yet do they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not know, or at least, not believe all the true grounds of Popery, which is indeed, <hi>The mistery of iniquity.</hi> And therefore do we just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confess, that many Papists, especially our fore-fathers, laying their only trust upon
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52420:37"/>
Christ and his Merits at their last breath, may be, and oftentimes are saved; detesting in that point, and thinking the cruelty of Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans worthy of Fire, that will admit no salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any Papist. I therefore thus do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point, That as upon the one part many honest men, seduced with some errors of Popery, may yet remain good and faithful Subjects: So upon the other part, none of those that truly know and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>elieve the whole grounds, and School-conclusions of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, can ever prove either good Christians, or faithful Subjects. And for the part of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain Princes and States, I may so much the more acquite them, and their Ministers, of their knowledge and consent to any such villany, as I may justly say, that in that point I better know all Christian Kings by my self, that no King nor Prince of Honor will ever abase him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so much, as to think a good thought of so base and dishonourable a Treachery: wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you therefore, that as GOD hath given me an happy peace and amity, with all other Christian Princes my neighbors (as was even now very gravely told you by my L. Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor) that so you will reverently judge and speak of them in this case. And for my part I would wish with those antient Philosophers, that there were a Christal window in my breast, wherein all my people might see the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretest thoughts of my heart, for then might you all see no alteration in my mind for this accident, further than in those two points. The first, caution and wariness in government:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52420:38"/>
to discover and search out the mysteries of this wickedness as far as may be: The other, after due trial, Severity of punishment upon those that shall be found guilty of so detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unheard of villany. And now in this matter, if I have troubled your ears with an abrupt Speech, undisgested in any good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod or order; you have to consider that an abrupt, and unadvised Speech doth best be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in the rela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>on of so abrupt and unor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly an accident.</p>
                  <p>And although I have ordained the Proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing of this Parliament until after Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mass upon two necessary respects: whereof the first is, that neither I nor my Council can have leasure at this time both to take order for the apprehension and trial of these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators, and also to wait upon the daily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Parliament, as the Council must do. And the other reason is, the necessity at this time of divers of your presences in your Shires that have Charges and Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there. For as these wretches thought to have blown up in a manner the whole world of this Island, every man being now come up here, either for publick causes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or else for their own private causes in Law, or otherwise: So these Rebels that now wander through the Countrey, could never have gotten so fit a time of safety in their passage, or whatsoever unlawful Actions, as now when the countrey by the foresaid occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions is in a manner left desolate, and waste un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Besides that, It may be that I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52420:38"/>
you at your next Session, to take upon you the Judgment of this Crime: for as so extraordinary a Fact deserves extraordinary Judgment, So can there not I think (follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even their own Rule) be a fitter Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them, then that they should be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured with the same measure wherewith they thought to measure us: and that the same place and persons, whom they thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy, should be the just avengers of their so unnatural a Parricide: Yet not knowing that I will have occasion to meet with you my self in this place at the beginning of the next Session of this Parliament (because if it had not been for delivering of the Articles agreed upon by the Commissioners of the Union, which was thought most convenient to be done in my presence, where both Head and Members of the Parliament were met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my presence had not otherwise been requisite here at this time:) I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought good for conclusion of this Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to discourse to you somewhat anent the true nature and definition of a Parliament, which I will remit to your memories, till your next sitting down; that you may then make use of it as occasion shall be ministred.</p>
                  <p>For albeit it be true, that at the first Session of my first Parliament, which was not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mine Entry into this Kingdome, It could not become me to informe you of any thing belonging to Law or State here: (for all knowledge must either be infufed, or acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and seeing the former sort thereof is now
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52420:39"/>
with Prophesie, ceased in the World, it could not be possible for me, at my first Entry here, before Experience had taught it me, to be able to understand the particular Mysteries of this State:) yet now that I have reigned almost three years amongst you, and have been careful to observe those things that belong to the Office of a King, albeit that Time be but a short time for experience in others, yet in a King may it be thought a reasonable long time, especially in me, who, although I be but in a manner a new King here, yet have been long acquainted with the office of a King in such another Kingdom, as doth nearest of all others agree with the Lawes and Customes of this State. Remitting to your considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to judge of that which hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the Commissioners of the Union, wherein I am at this time to signifie unto you, That as I can bear witness to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Commissioners, that they have not agreed nor concluded therein any thing, wherein they have not foreseen as well the Weale and Commodity of the one Countrey, as of the other; So can they all bear me record, that I was so far from pressing them to agree to any thing, which might bring with it any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to this People; as by the contrary I did ever admonish them, never to conclude upon any such Union, as might carry hurt or grudge with it to either of the said Nations: for the leaving of any such thing, could not but be the greatest hinderance that might be to such an Action, which GOD by the Laws of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52420:39"/>
ture had provided to be in his own time, and hath now in effect perfected in my Person; to which purpose my Lord Chancellor hath better spoken, then I am able to relate.</p>
                  <p>And as to the nature of this high Court of Parliament, It is nothing else but the Kings great Council, which the King doth assemble, either upon occasion of interpreting, or abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating old Lawes, or making of new, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as ill manners shall deserve, or for the publick punishment of notorious evil doers, or the praise and reward of the vertuous and well deservers; wherein these four things are to be considered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Whereof this Court is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. <note place="margin">1.</note>

                  <p>As for the thing it self, It is composed of a Head and a Body: The Head is the King, the Body are the members of the Parliament. This Body again is subdivided into two parts; The Upper and Lower House: The Upper compounded partly of Nobility, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral men, who are heritable Councellors to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52420:40"/>
to the high Court of Parliament by the honor of their Creation and Lands: And partly of Bishops, Spiritual men, who are likewise by the vertue of their place and dignity Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors, Life-Renters, or <hi>Ad vitam</hi> of this Court. The other House is composed of Knights for the Shire; and Gentry, and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses for the Towns. But because the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber would be infinite for all the Gentlemen and Burgesses to be present at every Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Therefore a certain number is selected and chosen out of that great Body, serving onely for that Parliament, where their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are the representation of that Body.</p>
                  <p>Now the Matters whereof they are to treat ought therefore to be general, and rather of such matters as cannot well be performed without the assembling of that general Body, and no more of these generals neither, then necessity shall require: for as <hi>in Corruptissima Republica sunt plurimae leges:</hi> So doth the life and strength of the Law consist not in heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up infinite and confused numbers of Lawes, but in the right interpretation and good execution of good and wholsome Laws. If this be so then, neither is this a place on the one side for every rash and harebrain fellow to propone new Laws of his own invention: nay rather I could wish these busie heads to remember that Law of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> That whosoever came to propone a new Law to the People, behoved publickly to present himself with a Rope about his neck, that in case the Law were not allowed, he should be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52420:40"/>
hanged therewith. So wary should men be of proponing Novelties, but most of all, not to propone any bitter or seditious Laws, which can produce nothing but grudges and discontentment between the Prince and his people: nor yet is it on the other side a convenient place for private men under the colour of general Laws, to propone no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their own particular gain, either to the hurt of their private neighbours, or to the hurt of the whole State in general, which many times under fair and pleasing Titles, are smoothly passed over, and so by stealth procure without consideration, that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meaning of them tendeth to nothing but either to the wreck of a particular par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or else under colour of publique benefit to pill the poor people, and serve as it were for a general Impost upon them for fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the purses of some private persons.</p>
                  <p>And as to the end for which the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ordained, being only for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods glory, and the establishment and wealth of the King and his people: It is no place then for particular men to utter there their private conceipts, nor for satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their curiosities, and least of all to make shew of their eloquence, by tyning the time with long studyed and eloquent Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. No, the reverence of GOD, their King, and their Countrey being well setled in their hearts, will make them ashamed of such toyes, and remember that they are there as sworn Councellors to their King, to give their best
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52420:41"/>
advice for the furtherance of his Service, and the flourishing Weale of his Estate.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, if you will rightly consider the means and wayes how to bring all your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors to a good end, you must remember, That you are here assembled by your lawful King to give him your best advices, in the matters proposed by bim unto you, being of that nature, which I have already told, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you are gravely to deliberate, and upon your consciences plainly to determine how far those things propounded do agree with the Weale, both of your King, and of your Country, whose weales cannot be separated. And as for my self, the world shall ever bear me witness, That I never shall propone any thing unto you, which shall not as well tend to the Weale publick, as to any benefit for me: So shall I never oppone my self to that, which may tend to the good of the Common-wealth, for the which I am ordained, as I have often said. And as you are to give your advice in such things, as shall by your King be proposed: So is it on your part your duties to propone any thing that you can, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation judge to be needful, either for these ends already spoken of, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for the discovery of any latent evil in the Kingdom, which peradventure may not have come to the Kings eare. If this then ought to be your grave manner of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this place, Men should be ashamed to make snew of the quickness of their wits here, either in taunting, scoffing, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52420:41"/>
the Prince or State in any point, or yet in breaking jests upon their fellowes, for which the Ordinaries or Alehouses are fitter places, than this Honourable and high Court of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>In conclusion then, since you are to break up, for the Reasons I have already told you, I wish such of you as have any charges in your Countreys, to hasten you home for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of the insolencies of these Rebels, and apprehension of their persons, wherein, as I heartily pray to the Almighty for your prosperous success: So do I not doubt, but we shall shortly hear the good newes of the same; And that you shall have an happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and meeting here to all our comforts.

                        <p>Here the Lord Chancellor spake touching the Proroguing of the Parliament. And hauing done, his Majesty rose again, and said.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Since it pleased GOD to grant me two such notable Deliveries upon one day of the week, which was Tuesday, and likewise one day of the Moneth, which was the fifth; thereby to teach me, That as it was the same Devil that still persecuted me: So it was one and the same GOD that still mightily deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered me; I thought it therefore not amiss, that the one and twentieth day of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> which fell to be upon Tuesday, should be the day of meeting of this next Session of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hoping and assuring my Self, that the same GOD who hath now granted me and you all so notable and gracious a Delivery,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52420:42"/>
shall prosper all our affairs at that next Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and bring them to a happy conclusion. And now I consider God hath well provided it that the ending of this Parliament hath been so long continued; For as for mine own part, I never had any other intention, but only to seek so far my weale, and prosperity, as might conjunctly stand with the flourishing State of the whole Common-wealth, as I have often told you: So on the other part I confess, if I had been in your places at the beginning of this Parliament (which was so soon after mine entry into this Kingdom, wherein ye could not possibly have so perfect a knowledge of mine inclination, as experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence since hath taught you) I could not but have suspected, and mis-interpreted divers things, In the trying whereof, now I hope, by your experience of my behaviour and form of government, you are well enough cleared, and resolved.</p>

But since to so hateful and unheard of invention, there can be no greater enemy then the self, the simple truth thereof being once publickly known and divulged; and that there needs no stronger argument to bring such a Plot in universal detestation, then the certainty that so monstrous a thing could once be devised, nay concluded upon, wrought in, in full readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and within twelve hours of the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: My threefold zeal to those blessings, whereof they would have so violently made us all Widows, hath made me resolve to set down here the true Narration of that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous and unnatural intended Tragedy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52420:45"/>
tempest. For the Saturday of the week, immediately preceding the King's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, which was upon a Thursday (being but ten days before the Parliament) The Lord <hi>Mountegle,</hi> Son and Heir to the Lord <note place="margin">A Letter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Lord <hi>Mountegle.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Morley,</hi> being in his own Lodging, ready to goe to supper, at seven of the clock at night, one of his Footmen (whom he had sent of an errand over the street) was met by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known man, of a reasonable tall personage, who delivered him a Letter, charging him to put it in my Lord his Masters hands: which my Lord no sooner received, but that having broken it up, and perceiving the same to be of an unknown, and somewhat unlegible hand, and without either Date or Subscription; did call one of his men unto him for helping him to read it. But no sooner did he conceive the strange contents thereof, although he was somewhat perplexed what construction to make of it (as whether of a matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, as indeed it was, or whether some foolish devised Pasquil, by some of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to scare him from his attendance at the Parliament) yet did he, as a most dutiful and loyal Subject, conclude not to conceal it, whatever might come of it. Whereupon, notwithstanding the lateness and darkness of the night in that season of the year, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently repaired to His Majesties Palace at <hi>Whitehal,</hi> and there delivered the same to the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> His Majesties Principal <note place="margin">Revealed to the Earl of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                     </note> Secretary. Whereupon the said Earl of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury</hi> having read the Letter, and heard the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52420:45"/>
manner of the coming of it to his hands, did greatly encourage, and commend my Lord for his discretion, telling him plainly, that whatsoever the purpose of the Letter might prove hereafter, yet did this accident put him in mind of divers advertisements he had received from beyond the Seas, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he had acquainted, as well the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as divers of His Privy Counsellors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning some business the Papists were in, both at home and abroad, making prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for some combination amongst them against this Parliament time, for enabling them to deliver at that time to the King, some <note place="margin">Purpose of the Papists for deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to His Majesty, to crave tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Religion.</note> petition for toleration of Religion: which should be delivered in some such order and so well backed, as the King should be loth to refuse their requests; like the sturdy beggars craving alms with one open hand, but carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a stone in the other, in case of refusal. And therefore did the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with the Lord <hi>Mountegle,</hi> that he would, in regard of the Kings absence, impart the same Letter to some more of His Majesties Council; whereof my L. <hi>Mountegle</hi> liked well: only adding this request by way of protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That whatsoever the event hereof might prove, it should not be imputed to him, as proceeding from too light, and too suddain an apprehension, that he delivered this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being only moved thereunto for demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of his ready devotion, and care for preservation of His Majesty and the State. And thus did the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> presently
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52420:46"/>
acquaint rhe L. Chamberlain with the said <note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Chamberlain</hi> made privy to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the Earl of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury.</hi>
                     </note> Letter. Whereupon they two, in presence of the Lord <hi>Mountegle;</hi> calling to mind the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer intelligence already mentioned, which seemed to have some relation with this Letter: The tender care which they ever carried to the preservation of His Majesties Person, made them apprehend, that some perilous attempt did thereby appear to be intended against the same, which did the more neerly concern the said Lord Chamberlain to have a care of, in regard that it doth belong to the charge of his Office to oversee as well all places of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly where His Majesty is to repair, as his Highness own private Houses. And therefore did the said two Counsellors conclude, That they should joyn unto themselves Three more of the Counsel, to wit, the Lord Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the Earls of <hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Northampton,</hi> to be also particularly acquainted with this accident, who having all of them concurred together to the re-examination of the Con tents of the said Letter, they did conclude That how slight a matter it might at the first appear to be, yet was it not absolutely to be contemned, in respect of the care which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved them to have of the preservation of His Majesties Person: But yet resolved for <note place="margin">Thought meet by the Counselors to acquaint the King with the Letter.</note> two reasons, First, To acquaint the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the same, before they proceeded to any further Inquisition in the matter, as well for the expectation and experience they had of His Majesties fortunate Judgement in cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and solving of obscure Riddles and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52420:46"/>
Mysteries; as also, because the more time would in the mean while be given for the Practise to ripen, if any was, whereby the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery might be the more clear and evident, and the ground of proceeding thereupon more safe, just, and easie. And so according to their determination, did the said Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> repair to the King in His Gallery upon Friday, being <hi>Alhallow</hi> day, in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, <note place="margin">Upon <hi>Alhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-</hi>day, the Earl of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the King.</note> which was the day after His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties arrival, and none but himself being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with His Highness at that time, where without any other Speech or Judgement gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Letter, but only relating simply the form of the delivery thereof, he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to His Majesty. The Contents whereof follow.</p>

                  <p>The King no sooner read the Letter, but after a little pause, and then reading it over again, he delivered his judgement of it in such sort, as he thought it was not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, <note place="margin">His Majesties judgement of the Leter.</note> for that the Stile of it seemed to be more quick and pithy, than is usual to be in any Pasquil or Libel (the superfluities of idle brains:) But the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> perceiving the King to apprehend it deeplier than he looked for, knowing his Nature, told him that he thougt by one sentence in it, that it was like to be written by some fool or mad man, reading to him this Sentence in it. <hi>For the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is past, as soon as you have burnt the Letter;</hi> which he said, was likely to be the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a fool: for if the danger was past so soon as the Letter was burnt, then the warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behoved to be of a little avail, when the burning of the Letter might make the danger to be eschewed. But the King by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, considering the former sentence In the Letter. <hi>That they should receive a terrible Blow at this Parliament, and yet should not see who hurt them,</hi> joyning it to the sentence imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately following, already alledged, did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon conjecture, That the danger mentioned
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52420:47"/>
should be some suddain danger by blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of Powder, For no other Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, Rebellion, or whatsoever other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and desperate Attempt could be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted or attempted in time of Parliament, and the Authors thereof unseen, except only if it were by a blowing up of Powder, which might be performed by one base knave in a dark corner; whereupon he was moved to interpret, and construe the latter Sentence in the Letter (alledged by the Earl of <hi>Salisbury)</hi> against all ordinary sense and construction in Grammar, as if by these words, <hi>For the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is past, as soon as you have burned the Letter,</hi> should be closely understood the suddainty and quickness of the danger, which should be as quickly performed, and at an end, as that paper should be of blazing up in the <note place="margin">His Majesties opinion for searching of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms in the Parliament House.</note> fire; turning that word of <hi>as soon,</hi> to the sense of, <hi>as quickly.</hi> And therefore wished, that before His going to the Parliament, the under rooms of the Parliament-house, (might be well and narrowly searched. But the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> wondring at this His Majesties Commentary, which he knew to be so far contrary to His ordinary and natural dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, who did rather ever sin upon the other side, in not apprehending nor trusting due Advertisements of Practises and Perils when he was truly enformed of them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he had many times drawn himself into many desperate dangers: and interpreting rightly, this extraordinary Caution at this time, to proceed from the vigilant care he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52420:48"/>
had of the whole State, more than of His own Person, which could not but have all perished together, if this designment had succeeded: He thought good to dissemble still unto the King, that there had been any just cause of such apprehensions. And ending the purpose with some merry jest upon this subject, as his custom is, took his leave for that time. But though he seemed so to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it to His Majesty; yet his customable and watchful care of the King, and the State still boyling within him. And having with the Blessed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> laid up in his heart, the Kings so strange judgement and constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it; He could not be at rest till he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the foresaid Lords what had passed between the King and him in private. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they were all so earnest to renew again the memory of the same purpose to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, as it was agreed that he should the next day, being Saturday, repair to His Highness: which he did in the same Privy Gallery, and renewed the memory thereof, the L. <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi> then being present with the King. At what time it was determined; that the said Lord <hi>Chamberlain</hi> should, according to his <note place="margin">The deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to search the Parliament House, and the rooms under it.</note> custom and Office, view all the Parliament Houses, both above and below, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what likelyhood or appearance of any such danger might possibly be gathered by the sight of them: but yet, as well for staying of idle rumours, as for being the more able to discern any mystery, the nearer that things were in readiness, his journey thither was
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52420:48"/>
ordained to be deferred till the afternoon, before the sitting down of the Parliament, which was upon the Munday following. At what time he (according to this conclusion) went to the Parliament house, accompanied with my Lord <hi>Mountegle,</hi> being in zeal to the Kings service, earnest and curious to see the event of that accident, whereof he had the fortune to be the first discoverer: where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving viewed all the lower rooms, he found in the Vault, under the Upper House, great store and Provisions of Billets, Faggots and <note place="margin">Wood and Coal found by the L. <hi>Chamberlain</hi> in the Vault.</note> Coals: And enquiring of <hi>Whyneard,</hi> Keeper of the Wardrobe, to what use he had put those lower Rooms and Cellars: he told him,, That <hi>Thomas Percy</hi> had hired both the House, and part of the Cellar or Vault under the same, and that the Wood and Coal therein was the said Gentlemans own provision. Whereupon the Lord <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> casting his eye aside, perceived a fellow standing in a corner there, calling himself the said <hi>Percy</hi>'s man, and keeper of that house for him, but indeed was <hi>Guido Fawkes,</hi> the owner of that <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Guido Fawkes</hi> bearing the name of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>'s man.</note> hand, which should have acted that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Tragedy.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Chamberlain</hi> looking upon all things with a heedful indeed, yet in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance with but a careless and rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less eye (as became so wise and diligent a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister) he presently addressed himself to the King in the said Privy Gallery, where in the presence of the Lord <hi>Treasurer,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,</hi>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:52420:49"/>
the Earls of <hi>Worcester, Northampton,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The L. <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and judgement of what he had obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the search.</note> and <hi>Salisbury,</hi> he made his report, what he had seen and observed there: noting, that <hi>Mountegle</hi> had told him; That he no sooner heard <hi>Thomas Percy</hi> named to be the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor of that house, but considering both his backwardness in Religion, and the old dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in friendship, between himself, and the said <hi>Percy,</hi> he did greatly suspect the matter, and that the Letter should come from him. The said Lord <hi>Chamberlain</hi> also told, That he did not wonder a little at the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary great provision of Wood and Coal in that house, where <hi>Thomas Percy</hi> had so seldom occasion to remain: As likewise it gave him in his mind, that his man looked like a very tall and desperate fellow.</p>
                  <p>This could not but increase the Kings former apprehension and jealousie: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he insisted (as before) that the House was narrowly to be searched, and that those Billets and Coals should be searched to the bottom, it being most suspitious that they were laid there only for covering of the Powder. Of the same mind also, were all the Counselors then present. But upon the fashion of making of the search, was it long <note place="margin">Disputations about the manner of the further search.</note> debated: for upon the one side they were all so jealous of the Kings safety, that they all agreed, that there could not be too much caution used for preventing his danger. And yet upon the other part, they were all extream loth and dainty, that in case this Letter should
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52420:49"/>
prove to be nothing but the evapouration of an idle brain; then a curious search being made, and nothing found, should not only turn to the general scandal of the King and the State, as being so suspicious of every light and frivilous toy, but likewise lay an ill savoured imputation upon the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> one of His Majesties great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Subjects and Counselors; this <hi>Thomas Percy</hi> being his kinsman, and most confident familiar. And the rather were they curious upon this point, knowing how far the King detested to be thought suspicious or jealous of any of His good Subjects, though of the meanest degree. And therefore, though they all agreed upon the main ground, which was to provide for the security of the Kings Person, yet did they much differ in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, by which this action might be best carried with least dinne and occasion of slander. But the King himself still persisting that there were divers shrewd appearances, and that a narrow search of those places could pre-judge no man that was innocent, he at last plainly resolved them, That either must all the parts of those rooms be nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly searched, and no possibility of danger left unexamined, or else he and they all must resolve not to meddle in it at all, but plainly to go the next day to the Parliament, and leave the success to Fortune, which he believed they would be loth to take upon their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: for in such a case as this, an half do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52420:50"/>
was worse than no doing at all. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was at last concluded, That nothing <note place="margin">Agreed that that the search should be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And to this purpose was Sir <hi>Thomas Knevet,</hi> (a Gentleman of His Majesties Privy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) employed, being a Justice of Peace in <hi>Westminster,</hi> and one, of whose antient fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, both the late Queen, and our now So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign have had large proof: who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the trust committed unto him, went about the midnight next after to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment house, accompanied with such a small number, as was fit for that errand.

him instantly confess his own guiltiness, declaring also unto him, That if he had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be within the house when he took him, as he was immediately before (at the ending of his work) he would not have fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have blown him up, house and all.</p>
                  <p>Thus after Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> had caused the wretch to be surely bound, and well guarded, by the company he had brought with him, he himself returned back to the Kings Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and gave warning of his succese to the Lord <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who immediately warning the rest of the <note place="margin">Upon Sir <hi>Tho.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52420:52"/>
Myne under the upper House of Parliament: which place we made choice of the rather, because Religion having been unjustly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed there, it was fittest that Justice and Punishment should be executed there.</p>
                              <p>This being resolved amongst us, <hi>Thomas Percy</hi> hired an house at Westminster for that purpose, near adjoyning to the Parliament House, and there we begun to make our Myne about the 11 of <hi>December</hi> 1604.</p>
                              <p>The five that first entred into the work, were <hi>Thomas Percy, Robert Catesby, Thomas Winter, Iohn Wright,</hi> and my self: and soon after we took another unto us, <hi>Christopher Wright,</hi> having sworn him also, and taken the Sacrament for Secrecy.</p>
                              <p>When we came to the very foundation of the Wall of the House, which was about three yards thick, and found it a matter of great difficulty, we took unto us another Gentleman, <hi>Robert Winter,</hi> in like manner with Oath and Sacrament as aforesaid.</p>
                              <p>It was about Christmass when we brought our Myne unto the Wall, and about Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas we had wrought the Wall half through: And whilest they were in working, I stood as Sentinel, to descrie any Man that came near, whereof I gave them warning, and so they ceased until I gave notice again to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
                              <p>All we seven lay in the House, and had Shot and Powder, being resolved to die in that place, before we should yield or be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="42" facs="tcp:52420:53"/>
As they were working upon the Wall, they heard a rushing in a Cellar of removing of Coales, whereupon we feared we had been discovered: and they sent me to go to the Cellar, who finding that the Coales were a selling, and that the Cellar was to be let, viewing the commodity thereof for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <hi>Percy</hi> went and hired the same for yearly rent.</p>
                              <p>We had before this provided and brought into the House Twenty Barrels of Powder, which we removed into the Cellar, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the same with Billets and Faggots, which were provided for that purpose.</p>
                              <p>About <hi>Easter,</hi> the Parliament being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued till October next, we dispersed our selves, and I retired into the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, by advise and direction of the rest, as well to acquaint <hi>Owen</hi> with the particulars of the Plot, as also least by my longer stay I might have grown suspicious, and so have come in question.</p>
                              <p>In the mean time <hi>Percy</hi> having the key of the Cellar, laid in more Powder and Wood into it. I returned about the beginning of <hi>September</hi> next, and then receiving the key again of <hi>Perey,</hi> we brought in more Powder and Billets to cover the same again, and so I went for a time into the Countrey till the 30 of <hi>October.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>It was further resolved amongst us, that the same day that this Act should have been performed, some other of our Confederates should have surprised the person of the Lady

ELIZABETH, the Kings eldest Daughter, who was kept in <hi>Warwickshire</hi> at the Lord <hi>Haringtons</hi> House, and presently have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed her Queen, having a Project of a Proclamation ready for that purpose; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we made no mention of altering of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, nor would have avowed the deed to be ours, until we should have had power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make our Party good, and then we would have avowed both.</p>
                              <p>Concerning Duke CHARLES the Kings second Son, we had sundry Consultations how to seise on his Person. But because we found no means how to compass it (the Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept near <hi>London,</hi> where we had not Forces enough) we resolved to serve our turn with the Lady ELIZABETH.</p>

                              <p>I remained with my brother in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey from Alhallontide until the beginning of Lent, in the year of our Lord 1603. the first year of the Kings Reign: about which time Master <hi>Catesby</hi> sent thither, intreating me to come to <hi>London,</hi> where he and other my friends would be glad to see me. I desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to excuse me: for I found my self not very well disposed; and (which had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened never to me before) returned the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger without my company. Shortly I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived another Letter, in any wise to come. At the second summons I presently came up, and found him with Master <hi>Iohn Wright</hi> at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> where he brake with me, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary it was not to forsake our Countrey (for he knew I had then a resolution to go over) but to deliver her from the servitude in which she remain'd, or at least to assist her with our uttermost endevours. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That I had often hazarded my life upon far lighter termes, and now would not refuse any good occasion, wherein I might do service to the Catholick Cause; but for my self I knew no mean probable to succeed. He said that he had bethought him of a way at one instant to deliver us from all our Bonds, and without any forreign help to replant again the Catholick Religion; and withal told me in a word, It was to blow up the Parliament-House with Gunpowder; for, said he, in that place have they done us all
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52420:56"/>
the mischiefe, and perchance GOD hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed that place for their punishment. I wondred at the strangeness of the conceipt, and told him, That true it was, this strake at the Root, and would breed a confusion fit to beget new alterations; But if it should not take effect (as most of this nature mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried) the Scandal would be so great which Catholique Religion might hereby sustain, as not only our Enemies, but our Friends also would with good reason condemn us. He told me, The nature of the disease required so sharp a remedy, and asked me if I would give my consent. I told him, yes, in this or what else soever, if he resolved upon it, I would venture my life. But I proposed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulties, As want of an House, and of one to carry the Myne, noise in the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and such like. His answer was, Let us give an attempt, and where it faileth pass no farther. But first, quoth he, Because we will leave no peaceable and quiet way untryed, you shall go over, and informe the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the state of the Catholicks here in <hi>England,</hi> intreating him to sollicite His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty at his coming hither, that the Penal Lawes may be recalled, and we admitted into the rank of his other Subjects: withal, you may bring over some confident Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, such as you shall understand best able for this business, and named unto me Mr. <hi>Fawkes.</hi> Shortly after, I passed the Sea, and found the Constable at <hi>Bergen</hi> near <hi>Dunkirke,</hi> where, by help of Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> I delivered my
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52420:56"/>
message, Whose answer was, That he had strict command from his Master, to do all good Offices for the Catholicks, and for his own part, he thought himself bound in Conscience so to do, and that no good occasion should be omitted, but spake to him nothing of this matter.</p>
                              <p>Returning to <hi>Dunkirck</hi> with Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> we had speech whether he thought the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable would faithfully help us, or no. He said he believed nothing less, and that they sought onely their own ends, holding small account of Catholicks. I told him, that there were many Gentlemen in <hi>England,</hi> who would not forsake their Countrey, until they had tried the uttermost, and rather venture their lives, than forsake her in this misery. And, to add one more to our number, as a sit man both for counsel and execution of whatsoever we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, wished for M <hi>Fawkes,</hi> whom I had heard good commendations of: he told me the Gentleman deserved no less, but was at <hi>Brussels,</hi> and that if he came not, as happily he might, before my departure, he would send him shortly after into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> I went soon after to <hi>Ostend,</hi> where Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi> as then was not, but came two dayes after. I remained with him three or four dayes, in which time I asked him, if the Catholiques in <hi>England</hi> should do any thing to help themselves, whether he thought the Archduke would second them? He answered, No, for all
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52420:57"/>
those parts were so desirous of peace with <hi>England,</hi> as they would endure no speech of other enterprise: neither were it fit, said he, to set any project afoot now the Peace is upon concluding. I told him there was no such resolution, and so fell to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of other matters, until I came to speak of M. <hi>Fawkes,</hi> whose company I wished over into <hi>England.</hi> I asked of his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in the Wars, and told him we should need such as he if occasion required; he gave very good commendations of him. And as we were thus discoursing, and I ready to depart for <hi>Newport,</hi> and taking my leave of Sir <hi>William,</hi> Master <hi>Fawkes</hi> came into our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, newly returned, and saluted us. This is the Gentleman, said Sir <hi>William,</hi> that you wished for, and so we embraced again. I told him, Some good friends of his wished his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in <hi>England,</hi> and that if he pleased to come to <hi>Dunkirck,</hi> we would have further conference, whither I was then going: so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my leave of them both, I departed. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two dayes after came Mr. <hi>Fawkes</hi> to <hi>Dunkirck,</hi> where I told him, That we were upon a resolution to do something in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> if the Peace with <hi>Spain</hi> helped us not, but had as yet resolved upon nothing; such, or the like talke we passed at <hi>Graveling,</hi> where I lay for a wind, and when it served came both in one Passage to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> near which place we took a pair of Oares, and so came up to <hi>London,</hi> and came to Mr. <hi>Catesby,</hi> whom we found in his lodging; he welcomed us into
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52420:57"/>
                                 <hi>England,</hi> and asked me what newes from the Constable. I told him, good words, but I fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the deeds would not answer. This was the beginning of Easter Terme, and about the midst of the same Terme, (whether sent for by Master <hi>Catesby,</hi> or upon some business of his own) up came Mr. <hi>Thomas Percy.</hi> The first word he spake (after he came into our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany) was, Shall we alwayes (Gentlemen) talke, and never do any thing? Mr. <hi>Catesby</hi> took him aside, and had speech about some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to be done, so as first we might all take an oath of secrecy, which we resolved within two or three dayes to do: so as there we met behind St. <hi>Clements,</hi> Mr. <hi>Catesby,</hi> Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wright,</hi> Mr. <hi>Guy Fawkes,</hi> and my self; and having upon a Primer given each other the Oath of secrecy, in a chamber where no other body was, we went after into the next Room and heard Mass, and received the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sacrament upon the same. Then did Mr. <hi>Catesby</hi> disclose to Mr. <hi>Percy,</hi> and I together with <hi>Iack Wright,</hi> tell to Mr. <hi>Fawkes</hi> the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness for which we took this Oath, which they both approved. And then was Mr. <hi>Percy</hi> sent to take the House, which Mr. <hi>Catesby</hi> in mine absence had learned did belong to one <hi>Ferris,</hi> which with some difficulty in the end he obtained, and became as <hi>Ferris</hi> before was, Tenant to <hi>Whynniard.</hi> Mr. <hi>Fawkes</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent the name of Mr. <hi>Percies</hi> Man, calling himself <hi>Iohnson,</hi> because his face was the most unknown, and received the keyes of the house, until we heard that the Parliament was
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52420:58"/>
Adjourned to the seventh of <hi>February.</hi> At which time we all departed several wayes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Countrey, to meet again at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Michaelmas-</hi>Terme. Before this time also it was thought convenient to have a house that might answer to Mr. <hi>Percies,</hi> where we might make provision of Powder and Wood for the Myne, which being there made ready, should in a night be conveyed by boat to the House by the Parliament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we were loath to foyle that with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten going in and out. There was none that we could devise so fit as <hi>Lambeth,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Catesby</hi> often lay, and to be keeper thereof (by Mr. <hi>Catesbies</hi> choice) we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the number, <hi>Keyes,</hi> as a trusty honest Man: this was about a Month before <hi>Michaelmas.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Some fortnight after, towards the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Terme, Mr. <hi>Fawkes</hi> and I came to Mr. <hi>Catesby</hi> at <hi>Morecrofts,</hi> where we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, That now was time to begin and set things in order for the Myne. So as Mr. <hi>Fawkes</hi> went to <hi>London,</hi> and the next day sent for me to come over to him: when I came, the cause was, for that the Scottish Lords were appointed to sit in conference of the Union in Mr. <hi>Percies</hi> house. This hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered our beginning until a fortnight before <hi>Christmass,</hi> by which time both Mr. <hi>Percy</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wright</hi> were come to <hi>London,</hi> and we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their coming had provided a good part of the Powder: so as we all five entred with tooles fit to begin our work, having provided
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52420:58"/>
our selves of Baked-meates, the less to need sending abroad. We entred late in the night, and were never seen, save onely Mr. <hi>Percy's</hi> Man, until <hi>Christmas-</hi>Eve. In which time we wrought under a little Entry to the Wall of the Parliament-House, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propped it as we went with Wood.</p>
                              <p>Whilest we were together, we began to fashion our business, and discoursed what we should do after this deed was done. The first question was, How we might surprise the next heir, the Prince haply would be at the Parliament with the King his Father, how should we then be able to seize on the Duke? This burthen Mr. <hi>Percy</hi> undertook, that by his acquaintance, he, with another Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman would enter the Chamber without suspition, and having some dozen others at several doors to expect his comming, and two or three on horseback at the Court-Gate to receive him, he would undertake (the Blow being given, until which he would attend in the Dukes Chamber) to carry him safe away: for he supposed most of the Court would be absent, and such as were there not suspecting, or unprovided for any such matter. For the Lady ELIZABETH, it were easie to surprise her in the Countrey, by drawing Friends together at an hunting near the Lord <hi>Haringtons,</hi> and <hi>Ashby,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byes</hi> house, being not far off was a fit place for preparation.</p>
                              <p>The next was for Money and Horses, which if we could provide in any reasonable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52420:59"/>
(having the Heir apparent) and the first knowledge by four or five dayes, was odds sufficient.</p>
                              <p>Then what Lords we should save from the Parliament, which was first agreed in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral as many as we could that were Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, or so disposed: but after we descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to speak of particulars.</p>
                              <p>Next what Forreign Princes we should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint with this before, or joyn with after. For this point we agreed, that first we could not enjoyn Princes to that secrecie, nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them by Oath, so to be secure of their promise: besides, we knew not, whether they will approve the Project, or dislike it. And if they do allow thereof, to prepare before might beget suspition; and not to provide until the business were acted, the same Letter that carried newes of the thing done, might as well intreate their help and furtherance. <hi>Spain</hi> is too slow in his prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, to hope any good from in the first extremities, and <hi>France</hi> too near and too dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, who with the shipping of <hi>Holland</hi> we feared of all the world might make away with us.</p>
                              <p>But while we were in the middle of these discourses, we heard that the Parliament should be anew Adjourned until after <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas,</hi> upon which tidings we broke off both discourse and working until after <hi>Christmas.</hi> About <hi>Candlemas</hi> we brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                                    <desc>•…</desc>
                                 </gap>ver in a boat the Powder, which we had provided at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and laid it in Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
                                 <pb n="55" facs="tcp:52420:59"/>
house, because we were willing to have all our danger in one place.</p>
                              <p>We wrought also another fortnight in the Myne against the stone Wall, which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to beate thorough; at which time we called in <hi>Kit Wright,</hi> and near to <hi>Easter,</hi> as we wrought the third time, opportunity was given to hire the Cellar, in which we resolved to lay the Powder, and leave the Myne.</p>
                              <p>Now, by reason that the charge of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining us all so long together, besides the number of several Houses, which for several uses had been hired, and buying of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had layn heavy on Mr. <hi>Catesby</hi> alone to support; it was necessary for him to call in some others to ease his charge, and to that end desired leave, that he, with Mr. <hi>Percy,</hi> and a third, whom they should call, might acquaint whom they thought fit and willing to the business: for many, said he, may be content that I should know, who would not therefore that all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany should be acquainted with their names: to this we all agreed.</p>
                              <p>After this Master <hi>Fawkes</hi> laid into the Cellar (which he had newly taken) a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of Billets, and Five hundred of Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, and with that covered the Powder, because we might have the House free, to suffer any one to enter that would. Mr. <hi>Catesby</hi> wished us to consider, whether it were not now necessary to send Mr. <hi>Fawkes</hi> over, both to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent himself for a time, as also to acquaint Sir

                                 <hi>Wil. Stanly</hi> and Mr. <hi>Owen</hi> with this matter. We agreed, that he should (provided that he gave it them with the same oath that we had taken it fore) <hi>videlicet,</hi> to keep it secret from all the world. The reason why we desired Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi> should be acquainted herewith, was, to have him with us so soon as he could: And for Mr <hi>Owen,</hi> he might hold good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency after with forreign Princes.</p>
                              <p>So Mr. <hi>Fawkes</hi> departed about <hi>Easter</hi> for <hi>Flanders,</hi> and returned the latter end of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust.</hi> He told me, that when he arrived at <hi>Brussels,</hi> Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi> was not returned from <hi>Spain,</hi> so as he uttered the matter on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Owen,</hi> who seemed well pleased with the business, but told him, that surely Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> would not be acquainted with any Plot, as having business now afoot in the Court of <hi>England:</hi> but he himself would be always ready to tell it him, and send him away so soon as it were done.</p>
                              <p>About this time did Mr. <hi>Percy,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Catesby</hi> meet at the <hi>Bath,</hi> where they agreed that the company being yet but few, Mr. <hi>Cates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> should have the others authority to call in whom he thought best; By which authority he called in after, Sir <hi>Everard Digby,</hi> though at what time I know not, and last of all Mr. <hi>Francis Tresham.</hi> The first promised, as I heard Master <hi>Catesby</hi> say, Fifteen hundred pounds; The second Two thousand pounds; Mr. <hi>Percy</hi> himself promised all that he could g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

to provide many galloping Horses, to the number of ten.</p>
                              <p>Mean while Mr. <hi>Fawkes</hi> and my self alone bought some new Powder, as suspecting the first to be damk, and conveyed it into the Cellar, and set it in order, as we resolved it should stand. Then was the Parliament anew prorogued until the Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> so as we all went down, until some ten days before, when Mr. <hi>Catesby</hi> came up with Mr. <hi>Fawkes,</hi> to an house by <hi>Enfield-Chace,</hi> called <hi>White-Webbs,</hi> whither I came to them, and Mr. <hi>Catesby</hi> willed me to enquire, whither the young Prince came to the Parliament: I told him, that I heard that his Grace thought not to be there. Then must we have our Horses, said Mr. <hi>Catesby,</hi> beyond the water, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of more company to surprize the Prince, and leave the Duke alone.</p>
                              <p>Two days after, being Sunday at night, in came one to my chamber, and told me that a Letter had been given to my Lord <hi>Mountegle</hi> to this effect, That he wished his Lordships absence from the Parliament, because a Blow would there be given; which Letter he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently carried to my Lord of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>

                              <p>On the morrow I went to <hi>White-webbes,</hi> and told it to Mr. <hi>Catesby,</hi> assuring him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that the matter was disclosed: and wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in any case to forsake his Countrey. He told me, he would see further as yet, and resolved to send Mr. <hi>Fawkes</hi> to try the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, protesting, if the part belonged to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he would try the same adventure.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="58" facs="tcp:52420:62"/>
On Wednesday Mr. <hi>Fawkes</hi> went, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned at night, of which we were very glad.</p>
                              <p>Thursday I came to <hi>London,</hi> and Friday Mr. <hi>Catesby,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tresham</hi> and I met at <hi>Barnet,</hi> where we questioned how this Letter should be sent to my Lord <hi>Mountegle,</hi> but could not conceive, for Mr. <hi>Tresham</hi> forsware it, whom we only suspected.</p>
                              <p>On Saturday night I met Mr. <hi>Tresham</hi> again in <hi>Lincolns-Inn</hi> Walks. Wherein he told such speeches, that my Lord of <hi>Salisbury</hi> should use to the King, that I gave it lost the second time, and repeated the same to Mr. <hi>Catesby,</hi> who hereupon was resolved to be gone, but staid to have Mr. <hi>Percy</hi> come up, whose consent herein we wanted. On Sunday Mr. <hi>Percy</hi> being dealt with to that end, would needs abide the uttermost trial.</p>
                              <p>This suspition of all hands, put us into such confusion, as Mr. <hi>Catesby</hi> resolved to go down into the Countrey, the Munday that Mr. <hi>Percy</hi> went to <hi>Sion,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Percy</hi> resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to follow the same night, or early the next morning. About five of the clock being Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, came the younger <hi>Wright</hi> to my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and told me, that a Nobleman, called the Lord <hi>Mountegle,</hi> saying, Arise, and come along to <hi>Essex-</hi>house, for I am going to call up my Lord of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> saying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, The matter is discovered. Go back Mr. <hi>Wright</hi> (quoth I) and learn what you can about <hi>Essex</hi> Gate. Shortly he returned and said, surely all is lost: for <hi>Lepton</hi> is got on horseback at <hi>Essex</hi> door, and as he parted,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52420:62"/>
he asked if their Lordships would have any more with him: and being answered No, is rode fast up <hi>Fleetstreet</hi> as he can ride. Goe you then (quoth I) to Mr. <hi>Percy,</hi> for sure it is for him they seek, and bid him be gone, I will stay and see the uttermost. Then I went to the Court-Gates, and found them straightly guarded, so as no body could enter. From thence I went down towards the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-house, and in the middle of <hi>King-street</hi> found the Guard standing, that would not let me pass, And as I returned, I heard one say, There is a Treason discovered, in which the King and the Lords should have been blown up. So then I was fully satisfied that all was known, and went to the Stable where my Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding stood, and rode into the Countrey. Mr. <hi>Catesby</hi> had appointed our meeting at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church,</hi> but I could not overtake them, untill I came to my brothers, which was Wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day night. On Thursday we took the Armor at my Lord <hi>Windsors,</hi> and went that night to one <hi>Stephen Littleton's</hi> house, where the next day (being Friday) as I was early abroad to discover, my man came to me, and said, That an heavy mischance had severed all the company, for that Mr. <hi>Catesby,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Grant,</hi> were burned with Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, upon which sight, the rest dispersed. Mr. <hi>Littleton</hi> wished me to flie, and so would he. I told him, I would first see the Body of my friend, and bury him, whatsoever befel me. When I came, I found Mr. <hi>Catesby</hi> reasonable well, Mr. <hi>Percy,</hi> both the <hi>Wrights,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi>
                                 <pb n="60" facs="tcp:52420:63"/>
and Mr. <hi>Grant.</hi> I asked them what they resolved to do: they answered, we mean here to die. I said again, I would take such part as they did. About eleven of the clock came the company to beset the house, and as I walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Court, I was shot into the shoulder, which lost me the use of mine arm: with the next shot was the elder <hi>Wright</hi> strucken dead, after him the younger Mr. <hi>Wright,</hi> and fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Ambrose Rookwood.</hi> Then said Mr. <hi>Catesby</hi> to me (standing before the door they were to enter) Stand by me <hi>Tom,</hi> and we will die to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Sir (quoth I) I have lost the use of my right arm, and I fear that will cause me to be taken. So as we stood cIose together, Mr. <hi>Catesby,</hi> Mr. <hi>Percy,</hi> and my self, they two were shot (as far as I could guess with one Bullet) and then the company entred upon me, hurt me in the belly with a Pike, and gave me other wounds, until one came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and caught hold of both mine arms.</p>

The news was no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er spread abroad that morning, which was upon a Tuesday, the Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> and the First day designed for that Session of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; The news (I say) of this so strange and unlooked for accident, was no sooner di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged, but some of those Conspirators, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Winter,</hi> and the two Brothers of <hi>Wrights</hi> thought it high time for them to hasten out of the Town (for <hi>Catesby</hi> was gone the night before, and <hi>Percy</hi> at four of the clock in the morning the same day of the Discovery) and all of them held their course, with more haste than good speed, to <hi>Warwick-</hi>shire, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Coventry,</hi> where the next day morning, being Wednesday, and about the same hour that <hi>Fawkes</hi> was taken in <hi>Westminster,</hi> one <hi>Graunt,</hi> a Gentleman having associated unto him some others of his opinion, all violent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, and strong Recusants, came to a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of one <hi>Benock,</hi> a Rider of Great Horses, and having violently broken up the same, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <note place="margin">The taking of the horses out of the Stable at <hi>Warwick</hi> by <hi>Graunt</hi> and others.</note> along with them all the great Horses that were therein, to the number of seven or eight, belonging to divers Noblemen and Gentlemen of that Country, who had put them into the Riders hands to be made fit for theire service. And so both that company of them which fled out of <hi>London,</hi> as also <hi>Graunt</hi> and his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52420:64"/>
met all together at <hi>Dunchurch</hi> at Sir <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard Digby</hi> his lodging the Wednesday at night after the discovery of this treacherous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: The which <hi>Digby</hi> had likewise for his <note place="margin">The hunting match ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Sir <hi>Everard Digby.</hi>
                     </note> part appointed a match of hunting to have been hunted the next day, which was Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesday, though his mind was <hi>Nimrod-</hi>like, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a farr other manner of hunting, more bent upon the bloud of reasonable men, than brute beasts.</p>
                  <p>This company, and hellish society thus convened, finding their purpose discovered, and their treachery prevented, did resolve to <note place="margin">Their going into Arms after the Plot disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</note> run a desperate course, and since they could not prevail by so private a Blow, to practise by a publick Rebellion, either to attain to their Intents, or at least to save themselves in the throng of others. And therefore gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the company they could unto them and pretending the quarrel of Religion, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving intercepted such provision of Armour, Horses, and Powder, as the time could permit, thought by running up and down the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey both to augment peece and peece their number (dreaming to themselves that they had the vertue of a Snow-ball, which being little at the first, and tumbling down from a great hill groweth to a great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by encreasing it self with the Snow that it meeteth by the way) and also that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning first this brave shew in one part of the Countrey, should by their Sympathy and example stir up and incourage the rest of their Religion in other parts of <hi>England</hi> to rise, as
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52420:65"/>
they had done there. But when they had gathered their Force to the greatest, they came not to the number of Fourscore, and yet were they troubled all the hours of the day to keep and contain their own servants <note place="margin">Their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber never above Four score.</note> from stealing from them; who (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of all their care) dayly left them, being far inferior to <hi>Gedeons</hi> Hoste in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but far more in faith, or justness of Quarrel.</p>
                  <p>And so after that this Gatholique Troop had wandered a while through <hi>Warwick-</hi>shire to <hi>Worcester-</hi>shire, and from thence to the edge and borders of <hi>Stafford-</hi>shire, this gallantly armed Band had not the honor at the last, to be beaten with a Kings Lieutenant, or extraordinary Commissioner sent down for the purpose, but only by the ordinary Sheriff of <hi>Worcester-</hi>shire, were they all bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, killed, taken and dispersed. Wherein ye <note place="margin">Their flight</note> have to note this following circumstance so admirable, and so vively displaying the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Gods justice, as it could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed without betraying in a manner the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry due to the Almighty for the same.</p>
                  <p>Although divers of the Kings Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were posted down after these Traitors, with all the speed possible, declaring the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousness of that bloudy attempt, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to have <hi>Percy</hi> preserved alive, if it had been possible, and the assembly together of that rightly damned crew, now no more darned Conspirators, but open and avowed Rebels: yet the far distance of the way (which
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52420:65"/>
was above an hundred miles) together with the extreme deepness thereof, joyned also with the shortness of the day, was the cause that the hearty and loving affections of the Kings good Subjects in those parts prevented the speed of His Proclamations. For upon the third day after the flying down of these Rebels, which was upon the Friday next after the discovery of their Plot, they were most <note place="margin">Overtaken at <hi>Holbeach</hi> in <hi>Stafford-shire,</hi> at <hi>Stephen Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton's</hi> house.</note> of them all surprized by the Sheriff of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester-</hi>shire at <hi>Holbeach,</hi> about the noon of the day, and that in manner following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Graunt,</hi> of whom I have made mention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for taking the great Horses, who had not all the preceding time stirred from his own house till the next morning after the attempt should have been put in execution, he then laying his account without his Host (as the proverb is) that their Plot had, without fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, received the day before, their hoped for success; took, or rather stole out those horses (as I said before) for enabling him, and so many of that soulless society that had still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the Countrey near about him, to make a suddain surprize upon the Kings el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Daughter, the Lady <hi>ELIZABETH,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her residence near by that place, whom <note place="margin">

                  <p>Now the violent taking away of those hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses long before day, did seem to be so great a riot in the eyes of the Common people, that knew of no greater Mystery: And the bold attempting thereof, did ingender such a suspition of some following Rebellion in the hearts of the wiser sort, as both great and small began to stirr and arm themselves, upon this unlooked for accident. Among whom, Sir <hi>Fulke Grevil</hi> the elder, Knight, as became one both so antient in years, and good reputation, and by his Office being Deputy-Lieutenant of <hi>Warwick-</hi>shire tho unable in his Body, yet by the zeal and true fervency of his mind, did first appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend this foresaid Riot, to be nothing but the sparkles and sure <hi>indices</hi> of a following Rebellion; whereupon both stoutly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly he took order to get into his own hands, the Munition and Armor of all such Gentlemen about him, as were either absent from their own houses, or in doubtful guard; And also sent such direction to the Towns about him, as thereupon did follow the striking of <hi>Winter</hi> by a poor Smith, who had likewise been taken by those vulgar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but that he was rescued by the rest of his company, who perceiving that the Countrey before them, had notice of them, hastened
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52420:66"/>
away with the loss in their own sight, Sixteen of their followers being taken by the Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and sent presently to the Sheriff at <hi>Warwick,</hi> and from thence to <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before Twelve or Sixteen hours past, <hi>Catesby, Percy</hi> the <hi>Winters, Wrights, Rook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> and the rest, bringing then the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that their main Plot was failed and bewrayed, whereupon they had builded the golden Mountains of their glorious hopes: They then took their last desperate resolution to flock together in a Troop and wander, as they did, for the reasons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told. But as upon the one part, the zealous duty to their God and their Sovereigne was so deeply imprinted in the hearts of all the meanest and poorest sort of the people (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though then knowing of no further mystery than such publick misbehaviours, as their own eyes taught them) as notwithstanding of their fair shews and pretence of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick cause, no creature, Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man through all the Countrey, would once so much as give them willingly a cup of drink, or any sort of comfort or support, but with execrations detested them: So on the other part, the Sheriffs of the Shires, where through they wandred, convening their people with all speed possible, hunted as hotly after them, as the evilness of the way, and the unprovidedness of their people up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that sudden could permit them. And so at last after Sir <hi>Richard Verney,</hi> Sheriff of</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:52420:67"/>
                     <hi>Warwick-</hi>shire, had carefully and straightly been in chase of them to the confines of his County, part of the meaner sort being also apprehended by him: Sir <hi>Richard W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of so many bloody and fearful crimes, as they cannot be aggravated by any inference, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or circumstance whatsoever, and that in three respects: First, because this offence is <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae impressionis,</hi> and therefore <hi>sine Nomine,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any name which might be <hi>adaequatum,</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to express it, given by any Legist, that ever made or writ of any Laws. For the highest Treason that all they could imagine, they called it only <hi>Crimen laesae Majestatis,</hi> the violating of the Majesty of the Prince. But this Treason doth want an apt name, as tending not only to the hurt, but to the death of the King; and not the death of the King only, but of his whole Kingdom, <hi>Non Regis, sed Regni,</hi> that is, to the destruction and dissolution of the frame and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of this Ancient, Famous, and ever-flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Monarchy, even the deletion of our whole Name and Nation: <hi>And therefore hold</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 83. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> 
                        <hi>not thy tongue, O God, keep not still silence, refrain not thy self, O God: for loe thine enemies make a murmuring, and they that hate thee have lift up their heads; They have said, Come, and let us root them out, that they be no more a people, and that the Name of Israel may be no more in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</hi> Secondly, it is <hi>Sine exemplo,</hi> beyond all examples, whether in fact or fiction, even of the Tragick Poets, who did beat their wits to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the most fearful and horrible murthers. Thirdly, it is <hi>Sine modo,</hi> without all measure or stint of iniquity, like a Mathematical line, which is <hi>Divisibilis in semper divisibilia,</hi> infinitely divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible: It is Treason to imagine or intend the the death of the King, Queen, or Prince.</p>
                     <p>For Treason is like a Tree, whose root is full
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52420:78"/>
of poyson, and lyeth secret and hid within the earth, resembling the imagination of the heart of man, which is so secret as God only knoweth it. Now the wisdom of the Law provideth for the blasting and nipping both of the leaves, blossoms and buds which proceed from this root of Treason, either by words which are like to leaves, or by some overt Act, which may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled to buds or blossoms, before it cometh to such fruit and ripeness as would bring utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and desolation upon the whole State.</p>
                     <p>It is likewise Treason to kill the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, Lord Treasurer, or any Justice of the one Bench or other, Justices of Assise, or any other Judge mentioned in the Statute of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. sitting in their Judicial places, and exercising their Offices. And the reason is, for that every Judge so sitting by the King's Authority, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth the Majesty and Person of the King, and therefore it is <hi>Crimen laesae Majestatis,</hi> to kill him, the King being always in Judgment of Law present in Court. But in the High Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, every man by vertue of the King's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by Writ under the Great Seal, hath a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial place, and so consequently the killing of every of them had been a several Treason, and <hi>Crimen laesae Majestatis.</hi> Besides, that to their Treasons were added open Rebellion, Burglary, Robbery, Horse-stealing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that this offence is such as no man can express it, no example pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern it, no measure contain it.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Forreign Princes, there was here a protestation made for the clearing of them from all imputation or aspersion whatsoever. First, for that whilst Kingdoms stood in hostility,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52420:78"/>
hostile Actions are holden honourable and just. Secondly, it is not the King's Serjeant, Attorney, or Solicitor, that in any sort touch or mention them: for we know that great Princes and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages are reverently and respectively to be spoken of, and that there is <hi>Lex in Sermone tenen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</hi> But it is <hi>Faux, Winter,</hi> and the rest of the Offenders, that have confessed so much as hath been said; and therefore the Kings Councel learned doth but repeat the Offenders Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and charge or touch no other person. They have also slandered unjustly our great Master King <hi>Iames,</hi> which we onely repeat, to shew the wickedness and malice of the Offenders. Thirdly, so much as is said concerning Foreign Princes, is so woven into the matter of the charge of these Offenders, as it cannot be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered or singled from the rest of the matter. So as it is inevitable, and cannot be pretermitted.</p>
                     <p>Now as this Powder Treason is in it self prodigious and unnatural, so is it in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and Birth most monstrous, as arising out of the dead ashes of former Treasons. For it had three Roots, all planted and watered by Jesuits, and English Romish Catholicks: The first Root in <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>December</hi> and <hi>March;</hi> the second in <hi>Flanders,</hi> in <hi>Iune;</hi> the third in <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Iuly.</hi> In <hi>England</hi> it had two Branches; One in <hi>December</hi> was twelve moneths, before the death of the late Queen of blessed memory: Another in <hi>March,</hi> wherein she died.</p>
                     <p>First, in <hi>December, Anno Dom.</hi> 1601. do <hi>Henry Garnet,</hi> Superior of the Jesuits in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; Robert Tesmond,</hi> Jesuit; <hi>Robert Catesby,</hi> who was <hi>(homo subacto &amp; versuto ingenio, &amp;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52420:79"/>
profunda perfidia)</hi> together with <hi>Francis Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham,</hi> and others; in the names, and for the behalf of all the English Romish Catholicks, employ <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> as for the general good of the Romish Catholick cause: And by him doth <hi>Garnet</hi> write his Letters to Father <hi>Creswel,</hi> Jesuit, residing in <hi>Spain,</hi> in that behalf. With <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> doth <hi>Tesmond, alias Greeneway</hi> the Jesuit go, as an Associate and Confederate in that Conspiracy. The Message (which was principally committed unto the said <hi>Winter)</hi> was, that he should make a proposition and request to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in the behalf and names of the English Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, that the King would send an Army hither into <hi>England,</hi> and that the Forces of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks in <hi>England</hi> should be prepared to joyn with him, and do him service. And further, that he should move the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to bestow some Pensions here in <hi>England,</hi> upon sundry Persons Catholicks, and devoted to his service: And moreover to give advertisement, that the said King of <hi>Spain,</hi> making use of the general discontentment that young Gentlemen and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were in, might, no doubt, by relieving their necessities, have them all at his devotion. And because that in all attempts upon <hi>England,</hi> the greatest difficulty was ever found to be the transportation of Horses; the Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> would assure the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to have always in readiness for his use and service 1500 or 2000 Horses, against any occasion or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise. Now <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> undertaking this Negotiation, and with <hi>Tesmond</hi> the Jesuit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Spain,</hi> by means of Father <hi>Creswel</hi>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52420:79"/>
the Legier Jesuit there, as hath been said, had readily speech with <hi>Don Pedro Francesa,</hi> second Secretary of State, to whom he imparted his Message, as also to the Duke of <hi>Lerma;</hi> who assured him, that it would be an office very grateful to his Master, and that it should not want his best furtherance.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the place for landing of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Army, which from the English Romish Catholicks he desired might be sent to invade the Land, it was resolved, That if the Army were great, that <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Kent</hi> were judged fittest. (Where note by the way, who was then Lord Warden of the <hi>Cinque Ports)</hi> If the Army were small, and trusted upon succour in <hi>England,</hi> then <hi>Milford-Haven</hi> was thought more convenient.</p>
                     <p>Now there being at that time Hostility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both Kingdoms, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly embraced the motion, saying, That he took the message from the Catholicks very kindly, and that in all things he would respect them with as great care as his proper <hi>Castili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> But for his further Answer, and full dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch, <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> was appointed to attend the Progress. In the end whereof, being in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-time, Count <hi>Miranda</hi> gave him this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer in the behalf of his Master, That the King would bestow a hundred thousand Crowns to that use, half to be paid that year, and the rest the next Spring following. And withall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that we should be as good as our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; for the next Spring he meant to be with us, and set foot in <hi>England.</hi> And lastly, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired on the Kings behalf of <hi>Winter,</hi> that he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52420:80"/>
might have certain advertisement and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, if so it should in the mean time happen that the Queen did die. <hi>Thomas Winter,</hi> laden with these hopes, returns into <hi>England</hi> about a month before <hi>Christmas,</hi> and delivered answer of all that had passed to <hi>Henry Garnet, Robert Catesby,</hi> and <hi>Francis Tresham.</hi> But soon after Set that Glorious Light, her Majesty died. <hi>Mira cano: Soloccubuit, Nox nulla secuta est.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Presently after whose death was <hi>Christopher Wright,</hi> another Messenger, sent over into <hi>Spain</hi> by <hi>Garnet,</hi> (who likewise did write by him to <hi>Creswel</hi> for the furtherance of the Negotiation) <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Tresham,</hi> in the name and behalf of all the Romish Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> as well to carry news of her Majesties death, as also to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the aforesaid Negotiation for an Invasion and Pensions, which, by <hi>Thomas Winter,</hi> had before been dealt in. And in the Spanish Court, about two moneths after his arrival there, doth <hi>Christopher Wright</hi> meet with <hi>Guy Fawkes,</hi> who upon the two and twentieth of <hi>Iune</hi> was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed out of <hi>Flanders</hi> from <hi>Bruxels,</hi> by Sir <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52420:80"/>
did; and withall to entreat that it would please him to send an Army into <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Milford Haven</hi> where the Romish Catholicks would be ready to assist him, and then the Forces that should be transported in <hi>Spinola's</hi> Gallies, should be landed where they could most conveniently. And these their several messages did <hi>Christopher Wright</hi> and <hi>Guy Fawkes</hi> in the end intimate and propound to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> But the King as then very honorably answered them both, that he would not in any wise further listen to any such motion, as having before dispatched an Ambassage into <hi>England</hi> to Treat concerning peace; Therefore this course by forreign forces fayling, they fell to the Powder plot, <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Tresham</hi> being in at all, in the Treason of the Earl of Essex, in the Treason of <hi>Watson</hi> and <hi>Clarke,</hi> Seminary Priests, and also in this of the Jesuits, Such a greedy appetite had they to practise against the State.</p>
                     <p>The rest of that which Master Attorney then spake continuedly, was by himself divided into three general parts. The first containing certain considerations concerning this Treason. The second observations about the same. The third a comparison of this Treason of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits, with that of the Seminary Priests, and that other of <hi>Rawley</hi> and others. For the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations concerning the Powder Treason, they were in number eight: That is to say, 1 The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by whom, 2 The persons against whom, 3 The time when, 4 The place where, 5 The means, 6 The end, 7 The secret contriving, And lastly, The admirable discovery thereof.</p>

they are of two sorts: either of the Clergy, or Laity, and for each of them there is a several objection made. Touching those of the Laity, it is by some given out, that they are such men as admit just exception, either desperate in estate, or ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Concerning those of the spiritualty, it is likewise falsly said, that there is never a Religious man in this action. For I never yet knew a Treason without a Romish Priest: but in this there are very many Jesuits, who are known to have dealt, and passed through the whole action: Three of them are Legiers and States men, as <hi>Henry Garnet, alias Walley,</hi> the Superiour of the Jesuits, Legier here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> Father <hi>Creswell</hi> Legier Jesuit in <hi>Spain,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Baldwin</hi> Legier in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> as <hi>Parsons</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> besides their Cursory men, as <hi>Gerrard, Oswald Tesmonda alias Greenway, Hamond, Hall,</hi> and other Jesuits: So that the principal offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors are the seducing Jesuits, men that use the reverence of Religion, yea even the most Sacred
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52420:81"/>
and Blessed name of JESUS as a mantle to cover their impiety, blasphemy, treason, and rebellion, and all manner of wickedness, as by the help of Christ shall be made most apparent to the glory of God, and the honour of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Concerning this Sect, their Studies and practises principally consist in two Degrees, to wit, in Deposing of Kings, and Disposing of Kingdoms: their profession and doctrine is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of distinctions, the greatest part of them being without the text, and therefore in very deed, idle and vain conceits of their own brains, not having <hi>Membra dividentia,</hi> that is all the parts of the division warranted by the word of God, and <hi>Ubi lex non distinguit, nec nos distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guere debemus.</hi> And albeit that Princes hold their Crowns immediately of and from God, by right of lawful Succession and inheritance inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent by Royal Blood, yet think these Jesuits with a Goose quill, within four distinctions to remove the Crown from the head of any King christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to deal with them as the old Romans are said to have done with their Viceroys, or petty Kings, who in effect were but Lieutenants unto them, to crown and uncrown them at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. Neither so onely, but they will proscribe and expose them to be butchered by vassals, which is against their own Canons, for Priests to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in cause of blood. And by this means they would make the condition of a King far worse than that of the poorest creature that breatheth. First saith <hi>Simanca. Haeretici omnes ipso Iure</hi>

every Heretick stands and is reputed with them as excommunicated and accursed, if not <hi>de Facto,</hi> yet <hi>de Iure,</hi> in law and right to all their intents and purposes, therefore may he be deposed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed and murdered. I but suppose he be not a professed Heretick, but dealeth reservedly, and keepeth his conscience to himself, how stands he then? <hi>Simanca</hi> answers, <hi>Quaeri autem solet, An</hi>

But suppose that a Prince thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed and deposed, will eftsoons return and conform himself to their Romish Church, shall he then be restored to his State, and again receive his Kingdom? Nothing less: For saith <hi>Simanca, Si Reges aut alij Principes Christiani facti sint Haeretici, protinus subjecti &amp; vasalli ab eorum do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minio liberantur. Nec Ius hoc recuperabunt, quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis postea reconcilientur Ecclesiae.</hi> O But <hi>Sancta Mater Ecclesia nunquam claudit gremium rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unti,</hi> Our holy Mother the Church never shuts her bosom to any Convert.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52420:82"/>
his Kingdom or State temporal he must not be restored. The reason is, Because all hold only thus far, <hi>Modò non sit ad damnum Ecclesiae:</hi> So that the Church receive thereby no detriment. I but suppose that such an unhappy deposed Prince have a Son, or lawful and right heir, and he also not to be touched or spotted with his Fathers crime, shall not he at the least succeed and be invested into that Princely estate? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will this down with them: Heresie is a lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, an hereditary disease. <hi>Et ex leprosis paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus leprosi generantur filij.</hi> Of leprous parents come leprous children.

                           </expan> haec certa, definita &amp; indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitata virorum doctissimorum sententia.</hi> That is, this inference also doth the whole School both of Divines and Lawyers make, (and it is a Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion certain, and to be undoubtedly believed) that if any Christian Prince whatsoever, shall manifestly turn from the Catholick Religion, and desire or seek to reclaim other men from the same, he presently falleth from all Princely Power and Dignity, and that also by vertue and force of the Law it self, both Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, even before any Sentence pronounced against him by the Supreme Pastor and Judge. And that his Subjects, of what estate or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition soever, are freed from all Bond of Oath of Allegiance, which at any time they had made unto him, as to their lawful Prince. Nay, that they both may and ought (provided they have competent strength and force) cast out such a man from bearing rule amongst Christians, as an Apostate, an Heretick, a backslider and revolter from our Lord Christ, and an enemy to his own State and Common-Wealth, lest perhaps he might infect others, or
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52420:83"/>
by his example or command turn them from the Faith. And this is the certain, resolute, and undoubted Judgment of the best learned men. But <hi>Tresham</hi> in his Book <hi>De Officio Principis Christiani,</hi> goeth beyond all the rest; for he plainly concludeth and determineth, that if any Prince shall but favour, or shew countenance to an Heretick, he presently loseth his Kingdom. In his fifth Chapter he propoundeth this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem, <hi>An aliqua possit secundum Conscientiam Subditis esse Ratio, cur legitimo suo Regi, bellum sine scelere moveant?</hi> Whether there may be any lawful cause, justifiable in Conscience, for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to take Arms, without sin, against their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prince and Sovereign? The resolution is, <hi>Si Princeps haereticus sit, &amp; obstinatè ac pertinaciter intolerabilis, summi Pastoris divina potestate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponatur, &amp; aliud caput constituatur, cui Subditi se jungant, &amp; legitimo ordine &amp; authoritate ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannidem amoveant. Princeps indulgendo haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos non solùm Deum offendit, sed perdit &amp; Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, &amp; gentem.</hi> Their conclusion therefore is; That for heresy, as above is understood, a Prince is to be deposed, and his Kingdom bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Pope at pleasure; and that the people, upon pain of damnation, are to take part with him whom the Pope shall so Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute over them. And thus whilst they imagine with the wings of their light-feathered distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to mount above the Clouds and level of vulgar conceits, they desperately fall into a Sea of gross absurdities, blasphemy and impiety. And surely the Jesuits were so far engaged in this Treason, as that some of them stick not to say, that if it should miscarry, that they were utterly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52420:84"/>
undone, and that it would overthrow the State of the whole Society of the Jesuits: And I pray God that in this they may prove true Prophets, that they may become like the Order of <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarii,</hi> so called, for that they kept near the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> who were by a general and universal Edict in one day throughout Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom quite extinguished, as being <hi>Ordo impieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> an Order of impiety. <hi>And so, from all Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and privy Conspiracy; from all false Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Heresie; from hardness of heart, and contempt of thy Word and Commandment, Good Lord deliver us.</hi> Their protestations and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, are to win souls to God, their proofs weak, light, and of no value; their conclusions false, damnable, and damned heresies: The first mentioneth God, the second savoureth of weak and frail Man, the last of the Devil, and their practise easily appeareth out of the dealing of their holy Father.</p>

And for <hi>France,</hi> even that part thereof which entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Popish Religion, yet never could of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time brook this usurped Authority of the Sea of <hi>Rome:</hi> Namely, that the Pope had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Excommunicate Kings, and Absolve Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from their Oath of Allegiance. Which Position is so directly opposite to all the Canons of the Church of <hi>France,</hi> and to all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the King's Parliament there, as that the very Body of <hi>Sorbone,</hi> and the whole University of <hi>Paris</hi> condemned it as a most schismatical, pestilent, and pernicious Doctrine of the Jesuits, as may appear in a Treatise made to the <hi>French</hi> King, and set out 1602. Entituled <hi>Le Franc Discours.</hi> But to return to the Jesuits, <hi>Catesby</hi> was resolved by the Jesuits, that the Fact was both lawful and meritorious, and herewith he perswaded and setled the rest, as any seemed to make doubt.</p>
                     <p>Concerning <hi>Thomas Bates,</hi> who was <hi>Catesby</hi>'s man, as he was wound into this Treason by his Master, so was he resolved, when he doubted of the lawfulness thereof, by the Doctrine of the Jesuits. For the manner, it was after this sort; <hi>Catesby</hi> noting that his man observed him extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily, as suspecting somewhat of that which he the said <hi>Catesby</hi> went about, called him to him at his Lodging in <hi>Puddle-Wharf,</hi> and in the presence of <hi>Thomas Winter,</hi> asked him what he
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52420:85"/>
thought the business was they went about, for that he of late had so suspiciously and strangely mark'd them. <hi>Bates</hi> answered, that he thought they went about some dangerous matter, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the particular were: whereupon they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him again, what he thought the business might be? and he answered, that he thought they intended some dangerous matter about the Parliament-House, because he had been sent to get a Lodging near unto that place. Then did they make the said <hi>Bates</hi> take an Oath to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret in the Action, which being taken by him, they then told him that it was true, that they were to execute a great matter; namely, to lay Powder under the Parliament-House to blow it up. Then they also told him that he was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament for the more assurance, and thereupon he went to Confession to the said <hi>Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> the Jesuit; and in his Confession told him, that he was to conceal a very dangerous piece of work, that his Master <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Thomas Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had imparted unto him, and said he much feared the matter to be utterly unlawful, and therefore therein desired the counsel of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit, and revealed unto him the whole intent and purpose of blowing up the Parliament-House upon the first day of the Assembly, at what time the King, the Queen, the Prince, the Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Temporal, the Judges, the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, should all have been there Convented, and met together. But the Jesuit being a Confederate therein before, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved and encouraged him in the Action, and said that he should be secret in that which his Master had imparted unto him, for that it was
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52420:85"/>
for a good cause. Adding moreover, that it was not dangerous unto him, nor any offence to conceal it: And thereupon the Jesuit gave him Absolution, and <hi>Bates</hi> received the Sacrament of him, in the company of his Master <hi>Robert Catesby,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Winter.</hi> Also when <hi>Rook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> in the presence of sundry of the Traitors, (having first received the Oath of Secresie) had, by <hi>Catesby,</hi> imparted unto him the Plot of the blowing up of the King and State; the said <hi>Rook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> being greatly amazed thereat, answered, That it was a matter of Conscience to take away so much blood. But <hi>Catesby</hi> replied, That he was resolved, and that by good Authority, (as coming from the Superiour of the Jesuits) that in Conscience it might be done, yea, though it were with the destruction of many Innocents, rather than the Action should quail. Likewise Father <hi>Hammond</hi> absolved all the Traitors at <hi>Robert Winters</hi> house, upon <hi>Thursday</hi> after the Discovery of the Plot, they being then in open Rebellion: And therefore, <hi>Hos, O Rex, magne caveto,</hi> and let all Kings take heed how they either favour, or give allowance or connivance unto them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The second Consideration respecteth the Persons against whom this Treason was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which are, 1. The King, who is Gods An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed; nay, it hath pleased God to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate unto him his own name, <hi>Dixi Dii estis,</hi> not Substantially or Essentially so; neither yet on the other side <hi>Usurpativè,</hi> by unjust Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Devil and the Pope; but <hi>Potestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vè,</hi> as having his Power derived from God within his Territories. 2. Their Natural Liege
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52420:86"/>
Lord and Dread Sovereign, whose just Interest and Title to his Crown may be drawn from before the Conquest; and if he were not a King by Descent, yet deserved he to be made one for his rare and excellent Endowments and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments both of Body and Mind. Look into his true and constant Religion and Piety, his Justice, his Learning above all Kings Christned, his <hi>Acumen,</hi> his Judgment, his Memory; and you will say that he is indeed, <hi>Solus praeteritis major, meliorque futuris.</hi> But because I cannot speak what I would, I will forbear to speak what I could. Also against the Queen, a most gracious and graceful Lady, a most virtuous, fruitful, and blessed Vine, who hath happily brought forth such Olive Branches, as that <hi>in benedictione erit memoria ejus,</hi> her memory shall be blessed of all our posterity. Then against the Royal Issue Male, next under God, and after our Sovereign, the future hope, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, joy, and life of our State. And as for preserving the good Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Kings Daughter, it should onely have been for a time to have served their purposes, as being thought a fit project to keep others in appetite for their own further advantage; and then, God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what would have become of her. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, against all the most Honourable and Prudent Counsellors, and all the true hearted and worthy Nobles, all the Reverend and Learned Bishops, all the grave Judges and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Law, all the principal Knights, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Citizens, and Burgesses of Parliament, the Flower of the whole Realm. <hi>Horret Animus,</hi> I tremble even to think of it. Miserable deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation!
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52420:86"/>
no King, no Queen, no Prince, no Issue Male, no Counsellors of State, no Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, no Bishops, no Judges. O barbarous, and more than <hi>Scythian</hi> or <hi>Thracian</hi> cruelty! No Mantle of Holiness can cover it, no pretence of Religion can excuse it, no shadow of good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention can extenuate it; God and Heaven condemn it, Man and Earth detest it, the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders themselves were ashamed of it, wicked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple exclaim against it, and the Souls of all true Christian Subjects abhor it. Miserable, but yet sudden had their ends been, who should have died in that fiery Tempest and storm of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder: but more miserable had they been that had escaped. And what horrible effects the blowing up of so much Powder and Stuff would have wrought, not onely amonst Men and Beasts, but even upon insensible Creatures, Churches and Houses, and all places near ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, you who have been Martial men best know. For my self, <hi>Vox faucibus haeret:</hi> so that the King may say with the Kingly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David, O Lord, the proud are risen against</hi>

the Lord, which hath not given us over for a prey unto their teeth. Our soul is escaped even as a bird out of the snare of the fowler; the snare is broken, and we are delivered. Our help stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the name of the Lord, which hath made heaven and earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third Consideration respects the time when this Treason was conspired: wherein note, that it was <hi>primo Iacobi,</hi> even at that time when his Majesty used so great lenity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Recusants, in that by the space of a whole year and four months, he took no Penalty by Statute of them. So far was his Majesty from severity, that besides the benefit and grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore specified, he also honoured all alike with advancement and favours; and all this was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued until the Priests Treason by <hi>Watson</hi> and <hi>Clark.</hi> But as there is <hi>Misericor dia puniens,</hi> so is there likewise <hi>Crudelitas parcens;</hi> for they were not onely by this not reclaimed, but (as plainly appeareth) became far worse. Nay, the Romish Catholiks did at that very time certifie, that it was very like, the King would deal ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously with them; and the same do these Traitors now pretend as the chiefest motive: whereas indeed they had Treason on foot against the King before they see his face in <hi>England.</hi> Neither afterwards for all the lenity he used towards them, would any whit desist or relent from their wicked attempts. Nay (that which cometh next to be remembred in this part of their Arraignment) they would pick out the time of Parliament for the execution of their hideous Treasons, wherein the flour of the land being assembled, for the honour of God,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52420:87"/>
the good of his Church, and this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, they might, as it were, with one blow, not wound, but kill and destroy the whole State. So that with these men, <hi>Impunitas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuum affectum tribuit peccandi,</hi> Lenity having once bred a hope of Impunity, begat not onely Insolency, but Impenitency and increase of sin.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We are to consider the place, which was the Sacred Senate, the House of Parliament. And why there? For that, say they, unjust Laws had formerly been there made against Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks; therefore that was the fittest place of all others to revenge it, and to do Justice in. If any ask, who should have executed this their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, it was Justice <hi>Fawkes,</hi> a man like enough to do according to his name. If by what Law they meant to proceed? It was Gun-powder Law, fit for Justices of Hell. But concerning those Laws which they so calumniate as unjust, it shall in few words plainly appear, that they were of the greatest, both moderation and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that ever were any: For from the year 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> unto 11. all Papists came to our Church and Service without scruple. I my self have seen <hi>Cornewallis, Beddingfield,</hi> and others, at Church. So that then, for the space of ten years, they made no conscience nor doubt to Communicate with us in Prayer: But when once the Bull of Pope <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> was come and published, wherein the Queen was accursed and deposed, and her Subjects discharged of their Obedience and Oath, yea, cursed if they did obey her; then did they all forthwith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain the Church, then would they have no more
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52420:88"/>
society with us in Prayer. So that Recusancy in them is not for Religion, but in an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Popes Power, and a plain manifestation what their judgment is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the right of the Prince in respect of Regal Power and Place. Two years after, <hi>viz. Anno 13 Eliz.</hi> was there a Law made against the bringing in of Bulls, &amp;c. <hi>Anno</hi> 18. came <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>yne</hi> a Priest to move sedition. <hi>Anno</hi> 20. came <hi>Campion</hi> the first Jesuit, who was sent to make a Party here in <hi>England,</hi> for the execution of the former Bull. Then follows Treasonable Books. <hi>Anno 23 Eliz.</hi> after so many years sufferance, there were Laws made against Recusants and sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Books. The Penalty or Sanction for Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sancy was not loss of Life, or Limb, or whole Estate; but onely a pecuniary Mulct and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, and that also until they would submit and conform themselves, and again come to Church, as they had done for ten years before the Bull. And yet afterwards the Jesuits and Romish Priests, both coming daily into, and swarming within the Realm, and infusing continually this poison into the Subjects hearts, that by reason of the said Bull of <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> her Majesty stood Excommunicated and deprived of her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that her Subjects were discharged of all obedience to her, endeavouring by all means to draw them from their Duty and Allegiance to her Majesty, and to reconcile them to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Then 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> a Law was made, That it should be Treason for any (not to be a Priest and an Englishman, born the Queens Natural Subject) but for any being so born her Subject, and made a Romish Priest, to come
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52420:88"/>
into any of her Dominions, to infect any her Loyal Subjects with their treasonable and damnaable perswasions and practises: Yet so, that it concerned onely such as were made Priests sithence her Majesty came to the Crown, and not before.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the execution of these Laws, it is to be observed likewise, that whereas in the Quinquenny, the five years of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> there were cruelly put to death about 300 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for Religion; In all her Majesties time, by the space of 44 years and upwards, there were for treasonable practises executed in all not 30 Priests, nor above five receivers and harborers of them; and for Religion, not any one. And here by the way, I desire those of Parliament to observe, that it is now questioned and doubted, Whether the Law of Recusants and reconciled Persons do hold for <hi>Ireland</hi> also, and the parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas; that is, Whether such as were there reconciled, be within the compass of the Statute or not, to the end it may be cleared and provided for.</p>
                     <p>Now against the Usurped Power of the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> we have of former times about thirteen several Acts of Parliament: So that the Crown and King of <hi>England</hi> is no ways to be drawn under the Government of any Foreign Power whatsoever; neither oweth duty to any, but is immediately under God himself. Concerning the Popes, for thirty three of them, namely, unto <hi>Silvester,</hi> they were famous Martyrs; but, <hi>Quicunque desiderat primatum in terris, inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niet confusionem in coelis:</hi> He that desires Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52420:89"/>
upon Earth, shall surely find confusion in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>The fifth consideration is of the end, which was, to bring a final and fatal confusion upon the State. For howsoever they sought to sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow their Impiety with the Cloak of Religion, yet they intended to breed a confusion fit to get new Alterations; for they went to joyn with Romish Catholicks, and discontented persons.</p>
                     <p>Now the sixth point, which is the means to compass and work these designs, were damnable, by Mining, by six and thirty Barrels of Powder, having Crows of Iron, Stones, and Wood, laid upon the Barrels, to have made the Breach the greater. Lord, what a Wind, what a Fire, what a Motion and Commotion of Earth and Air would there have been! But, as it is in the Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> when <hi>Elias</hi> was in the Cave in Mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> and that he was called forth to stand before the Lord, behold a mighty strong Wind rent the Mountains, and brake the Rocks, <hi>sed non in vento Dominus,</hi> but the Lord was not in the Wind. And after the Wind came a Commotion of the Earth and Air: <hi>Et non in Commotione Dominus,</hi> the Lord was not in that Commotion. And after the Commotion came Fire, <hi>Et non in igne Dominus,</hi> the Lord was not in the Fire. So neither was God in any part of this monstrous Action. The Authors whereof were, in this respect, worse than the very damned Spirit of <hi>Dives,</hi> who, as it is in the Gospel, desired that others should not come <hi>in locum tormentorum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:52420:89"/>
7. The next consideration is the secret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving and carriage of this Treason, to which purpose there were four means used. First, <hi>Catesby</hi> was commended to the Marquis for a Regiment of Horse in the Low-Countreys, (which is the same that the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> now hath) that under that pretence he might have furnished this Treason with Horses with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out suspicion. The second means was an Oath, which they solemnly and severally took, as well for secresie, as perseverance and constancy in the execution of their Plot. The form of the Oath was as followeth,</p>
                     <q>
                        <floatingText xml:lang="eng">
                           <body>
                              <div type="oath">
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>YOu shall swear by the Blessed Trinity, and by the Sacrament you now purpose to receive, never to disclose directly nor indirectly, by word or circumstance, the matter that shall be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to you to keep secret, nor desist from the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof, until the rest shall give you leave.</hi>
                                 </p>
                              </div>
                           </body>
                        </floatingText>
                     </q>
                     <p>This Oath was by <hi>Gerrard</hi> the Jesuit given to <hi>Catesby, Piercy, Christopher Wright,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> at once, and by <hi>Greenwel</hi> the Jesuit to <hi>Bates</hi> at another time, and so to the rest.</p>
                     <p>The third was the Sacrament, which they impiously and devillishly prophan'd to this end. But the last was their perfidious and perjurious equivocating, abetted, allowed, and justified by the Jesuits, not onely simply to conceal or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an open truth, but Religiously to aver, to

protest upon Savation, to swear that which themselves know to be most false; and all this, by reserving a secret and private sense in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to themselves, whereby they are by their Ghostly Fathers persuaded, that they may safely and lawfully delude any question whatsoever. And here was shewed a Book written not long before the Queens death, at what time <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> was employed into <hi>Spain,</hi> entituled, <hi>A Treatise of Equivocation;</hi> which Book being seen and allowed by <hi>Garnet,</hi> the Superior of the Jesuits, and <hi>Blackwel</hi> the Arch-priest of <hi>England,</hi> in the beginning thereof, <hi>Garnet,</hi> with his own hand, put out those words in the Title of <hi>Equivocation,</hi> and made it thus, <hi>A Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise against Lying, and Fraudulent Dissimulation;</hi> whereas indeed and truth it makes for both, <hi>Speciosáque nomina Culpae Imponis Garnette tuae.</hi> And in the end thereof, <hi>Blackwel</hi> besprinkles it with his Blessing, saying, <hi>Tractatus iste, valde doctus &amp; verè pius, &amp; Catholicus est.

Now in this Book there is, <hi>Propositio mentalis, verbalis, scripta,</hi> and <hi>mixta,</hi> distinguishing of a mental, a verbal, a written, and a mixt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, a very labyrinth to lead men into error and falshood. For example, to give you a little taste of this Art of cozening.</p>
                     <p>A man is asked upon Oath this question, Did you see such an one to day? he may, by this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, answer No, though he did see him, <hi>viz.</hi> reserving this secret meaning, not with purpose to tell my Lord Chief Justice. Or, I see him not, <hi>Visione beatifica,</hi> or, not in <hi>Venice, &amp;c.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, to answer thus, I was in the company, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving and intending secretly, as added, this word Not: As <hi>Strange</hi> the Jesuit did to my Lord Chief Justice and my self: Take one or two of these out of that very Book, as for purpose. A man cometh unto <hi>Coventry</hi> in time of a sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of Plague, and at the Gates the Officers meet him, and upon his Oath examine him, whether he came from <hi>London</hi> or no, where they think certainly the Plague to be: This man knowing for certain the Plague not to be at <hi>London,</hi> or at least knowing that the Air is not there infectious, and that he only rid through some secret place of <hi>London,</hi> not staying there, may safely swear he came not from <hi>London,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering to their final intention in their demand, that is, whether he came so from <hi>London,</hi> that he may endanger their City of the Plague, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their immediate intention were to know whether he came from <hi>London</hi> or no. That man (saith the Book) the very light of nature would clear from Perjury. In like manner, one being Convented in the Bishop's Court, because
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52420:91"/>
he refuseth to take such a one to his Wife, as he had Contracted with <hi>per verba de praesenti,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Contracted with another privily before, so that he cannot be Husband to her that claimeth him, may answer, that he never Contracted with her <hi>per verba de praesenti,</hi> understanding that he did not so Contract that it was a Marriage, for that is the final intention of the Judge, to know whether there were a sufficient Marriage between them or no Never did Father <hi>Cranmer,</hi> Father <hi>Latimer,</hi> Father <hi>Ridley,</hi> those blessed Martyrs know these shifts, neither would they have used them to have saved their lives. And surely let every good man take heed of such Jurors or Witnesses, there being no Faith, no bond of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or Civility, no Conscience of Truth in such men, and therefore the conclusion shall be that of the Prophet <hi>David: Domine, libera Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam meam à labiis iniquis &amp; à lingua dolosa; Deliver me, O Lord, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue.</hi>

                        <hi>S. P. Q. R.</hi> Was sometimes taken for these words, <hi>Senatus Populus<expan>
                              <am>

The Cat having a long time preyed upon the Mice, the poor creatures at last, for their safety, contained themselves within their holes; but the Cat finding his prey to cease, as being known to the Mice, that he was indeed their enemy, and a Cat, deviseth this course fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>viz.</hi> changeth his hue, getteth on a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52420:91"/>

Hereupon some of the more credulous and bold among them, were again by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit snatched up; and therefore when afterwards he came as before to entice them forth, they would come out no more, but answered, <hi>Cor tibi restat idem, vix tibi proesto fidem,</hi> Talk what you can, we will never believe you, you have still a Cats heart within you: you do not watch and pray, but you watch to prey. And so have the Jesuits, yea, and Priests too; for they are all joyned in the tails like <hi>Sampson</hi>'s Foxes, <hi>Ephraim</hi> against <hi>Manasses,</hi> and <hi>Manasses</hi> against <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but both against <hi>Iuda.</hi>

                     <p n="8">8. The last Consideration is, concerning the admirable discovery of this Treason, which was by one of themselves, who had taken the Oath and Sacrament, as hath been said, against his own will: The means was, by a dark and doubtful Letter sent to my Lord <hi>Mountegle.</hi> And thus much as touching the Considerations; the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations follow, to be considered in this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Treason, and are briefly thus.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If the Cellar had not been hired, the Mine-work could hardly or not at all have been discovered; for the Mine was neither found, nor suspected, until the danger was past, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Offenders apprehended, and by themselves, upon Examination, confessed.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:52420:92"/>
2. How the King was Divinely illuminated by Almighty God, the only Ruler of Princes, like an Angel of God, to direct and point as it were to the very place, to cause a search to be made there, out of those dark words of the Letter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a terrible Blow.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Observe a miraculous accident which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel in <hi>Stephen Littleton</hi>'s house, called <hi>Holbach</hi> in <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> after they had been two days in open Rebellion, immediately before the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of these Traitors: For some of them standing by the fire-side, and having set <hi>2l.</hi> and <hi>di.</hi> of Powder to drie in a Platter before the fire, and under-set the said Platter with a great linen bag, full of other Powder, containing some fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or sixteen pounds; it so fell out, that one coming to put more wood into the fire, and casting it on, there flew a coal into the Platter, by reason whereof, the Powder taking fire and blowing up, scorched those who were nearest, as <hi>Catesby, Graunt,</hi> and <hi>Rookewood,</hi> blew up the roof of the house, and the linnen bag which was set under the Platter being therewith sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly carried out through the Breach, fell down in the Court-yard whole and unfired; which if it had took fire in the room, would have slain them all there, so that they never should have come to this Trial. And, <hi>Lex justior ulla est, Quàm necis artifices arte perire sua?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Note, That Gun-powder was the invention of a Friar, one of that Romish Rabble; as Printing was of a Soldier.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Observe the sending of <hi>Rainham,</hi> one of the damned Crew, to the High Priest of <hi>Rome,</hi> to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52420:92"/>
give signification of this blow, and to crave his direction and aid.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That for all their stirring and rising in open Rebellion, and notwithstanding the false Rumors given out by them, that the throats of all Catholicks should be cut; such is his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties blessed Government, and the Loyalty of his Subjects, as they got not any one man to take their parts besides their own company.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Observe, the Sheriff, the ordinary Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Justice, according to the duty of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, with such power as he on a sudden by Law collected, suppressed them.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. That God suffered their intended mischief to come so near the period, as not to be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered but within few hours before it should have been executed.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. That it was in the entring of the Sun into the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> when they began their Mine; noting, that by Mineing they should descend, and by Hanging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. That there never was any Protestant Minister in any Treason and Murder, as yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted within this Realm.</p>
                     <p>I am now come to the last part, which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <note place="margin">Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> in the beginning of this discourse, and that is, touching certain Comparisons of this Powder Treason of the Jesuits, with that of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi> and the other of the Priests, <hi>Watson</hi> and <hi>Clark.</hi> 1. They had all one end, and that was the Romish Catholick cause. 2. The same means, by Popish and discontented persons, Priests and Lay-men. 3. They all plaid at ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard; the Priests were at the By, <hi>Raleigh</hi> at the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52420:93"/>
Main, but these in at all, as purposing to destroy all the Kings Royal Issue, and withall the whole Estate. 4. They were all alike obliged by the same Oath and Sacrament. 5. The same Proclamations were intended (after the fact) to be published for reformation of abuses. 6. The like Army provided for invading, to land at <hi>Milford-haven,</hi> or in <hi>Kent.</hi> 7. The same Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Crowns promised. 8. The agreeing of the times of the Treason of <hi>Raleigh</hi> and these men, which was, when the Constable of <hi>Spain</hi> was coming hither, and <hi>Raleigh</hi> said, there could be no suspicion of any Invasion, seeing that the Constable of <hi>Spain</hi> was then expected for a Treaty of Peace; and the Navy might be brought to the <hi>Groine</hi> under pretence of the Service in the <hi>Low-Countreys.</hi> And <hi>Raleigh</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther said, That many more were hanged for words than for deeds. And before <hi>Raleigh</hi>'s Treason was discovered, it was reported in <hi>Spain,</hi> That <hi>Don Raleigh</hi> and <hi>Don Cobham</hi> should cut the King of <hi>England</hi>'s throat. I say not that we have any proofs, that these of the Powder-plot were acquainted with <hi>Raleigh,</hi> or <hi>Raleigh</hi> with them: but as before was spoken of the Jesuits and Priests, so they all were joyned in the ends, like <hi>Samson</hi>'s Foxes in the tails, howsoever se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in their heads.</p>
                     <p>The Conclusion shall be, from the admirable <note place="margin">Conclusion</note> clemency and moderation of the King, in that howsoever these Traitors have exceeded all others their Predecessors in mischief, and so <hi>Crescente malitia, crescere debuit &amp; Poena;</hi> yet neither will the King exceed the usual punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Law, nor invent any new torture or
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52420:93"/>
torment for them, but is graciously pleased to afford them as well an ordinary course of Trial, as an ordinary punishment, much inferiour to their offence. And surely worthy of observation is the punishment by Law provided and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for High Treason, which we call <hi>Crimen laesae Majestatis.</hi> For first, after a Traitor hath had his just Trial, and is convicted and attainted, he shall have his judgment to be drawn to the place of Execution from his Prison, as being not worthy any more to tread upon the face of the earth, whereof he was made. Also for that he hath been retrograde to Nature, therefore is he drawn backwards at a Horse-tail. And whereas God hath made the head of man the highest and most supreme part, as being his chief grace and ornament: <hi>Pronáque cum spectent Animalia cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera terram, Os homini sublime dedit;</hi> he must be drawn with his head declining downward, and lying so near the ground as may be, being thought unfit to take benefit of the common Air: For which cause also he shall be Strangled, being hanged up by the neck between Heaven and Earth, as deemed unworthy of both, or either; as likewise, that the eyes of men may behold, and their hearts contemn him. Then is he to be cut down alive, and to have his Privy parts cut off, and burnt before his face, as being unworthily begotten, and unfit to leave any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration after him. His bowels and inlayed parts taken out and burnt, who inwardly had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and harboured in his heart such horrible Treason. After, to have his head cut off, which had imagined the mischief. And lastly, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be quartered, and the quarters set up in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52420:94"/>
some high and eminent place, to the view and detestation of men, and to become a prey for the Fouls of the Air. And this is a reward due to Traitors, whose hearts be hardned: for that it is Physick of State and Government, to let out cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt blood from the heart. But, <hi>Poenitentia vera nunquam sera, sed paenitentia sera rarò vera.</hi> True repentance is indeed never too late, but late repentance is seldom found true; which yet I pray the merciful Lord to grant unto them, that having a sense of their offences, they may make a true and sincere Confession, both for their Souls health, and for the good and safety of the King and this State. And for the rest that are not yet apprehended, my prayer to God is, <hi>Ut aut convertantur ne pereant, aut confundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ne noceant;</hi> that either they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, to the end they perish not, or else con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded that they hurt not.</p>
                     <p>After this, by the direction of Master Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney General, were their several Examinations (subscribed by themselves) shewed particularly unto them, and acknowledged by them to be their own, and true, wherein every one had confessed the Treason. Then did Master At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney desire, that albeit that which had been already done and confessed at the Bar, might be all-sufficient for the Declaration and Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the course of Justice then held, especially seeing we have <hi>Reos confitentes,</hi> the Traitors own voluntary Confessions at the Bar; yet for further satisfaction to so great a Presence and Audience, and their better memory of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of these Treasons, the voluntary and free Confessions of all the said several Traitors in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52420:94"/>
writing, subscribed with their own proper hands, and acknowledged at the Bar by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be true, were openly and distinctly read. By which, amongst other things, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that <hi>Bates</hi> was resolved for what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook concerning the Powder-Treason, and being therein warranted by the Jesuits. Also it appeared, that <hi>Hammond</hi> the Jesuit, after that he knew the Powder-Treason was discovered, and that these Traitors had been in actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, Confessed them and gave them Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and this was on <hi>Thursday</hi> the <hi>7th.</hi> of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember.</hi> Here also was mention made by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Attorney, of the Confessions of <hi>Watson</hi> and <hi>Clark,</hi> Seminary Priests, upon their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, who affirmed, That there was some Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son intended by the Jesuits, and then in hand, as might appear; First, by their continual ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiating at that time with <hi>Spain,</hi> which they assured themselves tended to nothing, but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for a Foreign commotion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By their collecting and gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such great sums of money, as then they had done, therewith to levy an Army when time should serve.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. For that sundry of the Jesuits had been tampering with Catholicks, as well to disswade them from acceptance of the King at his first coming, saying, That they ought rather to die, than to admit of any Heretick (as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually termed his Majesty) to the Crown: And that they might not, under pain of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, accept of any but a Catholick for their Sovereign; as al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> to disswade Catholicks from their Loyalty, after the State was setled.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:52420:95"/>
Lastly, in that they had both bought up store of great Horses throughout the Countrey, and conveyed Powder, and Shot, and Artillery secretly to their Friends, wishing them not to stir, but keep themselves quiet until they heard from them.</p>
                     <p>After the reading of their several Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Confessions, and voluntary Declarations, as well of themselves, as of some of their dead Confederates, they were all, by the Verdict of the Jury, found guilty of the Treasons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in their Indictment; and then being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally asked what they could say, wherefore Judgment of Death should not be pronounced against them, there was not one of these (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Rookwood)</hi> who would make any conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Speech, either in defence or extenuation of the fact. <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> onely desired, that he might be Hanged both for his Brother and himself. <hi>Guy Fawkes</hi> being asked why he pleaded <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> having nothing to say for his excuse, answered, That he had so done in respect of certain conferences mentioned in the Indictment, which, he said, that he knew not of; which were answered to have been set down according to course of Law, as necessarily presupposed before the resolution of such a design. <hi>Keyes</hi> said, That his Estate and Fortunes were desperate, and as good now as another time, and for this cause rather than for another. <hi>Bates</hi> craved mercy. <hi>Robert Winter</hi> mercy. <hi>Iohn Grant</hi> was a good while mute, yet after submissly said, He was guilty of a Conspiracy intended, but never effected. But <hi>Ambrose Rook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> first excused his denial of the Indictment,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52420:95"/>
for that he had rather lose his life than give it. Then did he acknowledge his offence to be so heinous, that he justly deserved the indignation of the King, and of the Lords, and the hatred of the whole Common-wealth; yet could he not despair of Mercy at the hands of a Prince, so abounding in Grace and Mercy: And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because his Offence, though it were inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any excuse, yet not altogether incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of some extenuation, in that he had been neither Author nor Actor, but onely perswaded and drawn in by <hi>Catesby,</hi> whom he loved above any worldly man: And that he had concealed it, not for any malice to the Person of the King, or to the State, or for any ambitious respect of his own, but onely drawn with the tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, and the faithful and dear affection he bare to Mr. <hi>Catesby</hi> his Friend, whom he esteemed more dear than any thing else in the world. And this mercy he desired not for any fear of the image of Death, but for grief that so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Death should leave so perpetual a blemish and blot unto all Ages upon his Name and Blood. But howsoever that this was his first Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, yet he humbly submitted himself to the Mercy of the King, and prayed, that the King would herein imitate God, who sometimes doth punish <hi>corporaliter, non mortaliter;</hi> corporally, yet not mortally.</p>
                     <p>Then was related, how that on <hi>Friday</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before this Arraignment, <hi>Robert Winter</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found opportunity to have conference with <hi>Fawkes</hi> in the <hi>Tower,</hi> in regard of the nearness of their Lodgings, should say to <hi>Fawkes,</hi> as <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Winter</hi> and <hi>Fawkes</hi> confessed, That he and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52420:96"/>
                        <hi>Catesby</hi> had Sons, and that Boys would be men, and that he hoped they would revenge the cause: nay, that God would raise up Children to <hi>Abraham</hi> out of stones. Also that they were sorry, that no body did set forth a Defence or Apology of their Action; but yet they would maintain the cause at their deaths.</p>
                     <p>Here also was reported <hi>Robert Winters</hi> Dream, which he had before the blasting with Powder in <hi>Littletons</hi> house, and which he himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, and first notified, <hi>viz.</hi> That he thought he saw Steeples stand awry, and within those Churches strange and unknown faces. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when the foresaid blast had, the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, scorched divers of the Confederates, and much disfigured the faces and countenances of <hi>Grant, Rookwood,</hi> and others: Then did <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> call to mind his Dream, and to his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance thought, that the faces of his Associates so scorched, resembled those which he had seen in his Dream. And thus much concerning the former Indictment.</p>
                     <p>Then was Sir <hi>Everard Digby</hi> Arraigned, and after his Indictment was read, wherein he was <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> Indicted Look the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> charged, not onely to have been acquainted with the Powder-treason, and concealed it, and taken the double Oath of Secresie and Constancy therein, but likewise to have been an Actor in this Conspiracy. And lastly, to have exposed, and openly shewed himself in the Rebellion in the Countrey, amongst the rest of the Traitors. All which, after he had attentively heard and marked, knowing that he had freely confessed it, and the strength and evidence of the proofs against him, and convicted with the testimony
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52420:96"/>
of his own Conscience, shewed his disposition to confess the principal part of the said Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and so began to enter into a Discourse. But being advertised, that he must first plead to the Indictment directly, either Guilty, or Not Guilty, and that afterwards he should be licensed to speak his pleasure, he forthwith confessed the Treason contained in the Indictment, and so fell into a Speech, whereof there were two parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Motives and Petitions. The first Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>'s Speech.</note> which drew him into this action, was not ambition, nor discontentment of his estate, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther malice to any in Parliament, but the friendship and love he bare to <hi>Catesby,</hi> which prevailed so much, and was so powerful with him, as that for his sake he was ever contented and ready to hazard himself and his Estate. The next Motive was, the cause of Religion, which alone, seeing (as he said) it lay at the stake, he entred into resolution to neglect in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, his Estate, his Life, his Name, his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, his Posterity, and all worldly and earthly fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity whatsoever, though he did utterly extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate and extinguish all other hopes, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing of the Catholick Religion in <hi>England.</hi> His third Motive was, That promises were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the Catholicks. And lastly, That they generally feared harder Laws from this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against Recusants, as, That Recusants Wives, and Women, should be liable to the Mulct as well as their Husbands, and Men. And further, that it was supposed, that it should be made a <hi>Praemunire</hi> onely to be a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:52420:97"/>
His Petitions were, That sithens his offence was confined and contained within himself, that the punishment also of the same might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend onely to himself, and not be transferred either to his Wife, Children, Sisters, or others: and therefore for his Wife he humbly craved, that she might enjoy her Joynture, his Son the benefit of an Entail made long before any thought of this action; his Sisters, their just and due Portions which were in his hands; his Creditors, their rightful Debts; which that he might more justly set down under his hand, he requested, that before his death, his Man (who was better acquainted both with the men, and the particulars, than himself) might be licensed to come unto him. Then prayed he pardon of the King and Ll. for his guilt. And lastly, he entreated to be beheaded, desiring all men to forgive him, and that his death might satisfie them for his trespass.</p>
                     <p>To this Speech forthwith answered Sir <hi>Edw. Coke,</hi> Attorney General, but in respect of the <note place="margin">Mr. Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</note> time (for it grew now dark) very briefly. 1. For his friendship with <hi>Catesby,</hi> that it was mere folly, and wicked Conspiracy. 2. His Religion, Error, and Heresie. 3. His promises, idle and vain presumptions: As also his fears, false alarms. Concerning Wives that were Recusants, if they were known so to be before their Husbands (though they were good Protestants) took them, and yet for outward and worldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects whatsoever, any would match with such, great reason there is, that he or they should pay for it, as knowing the penalty and burthen before; for, <hi>Volenti &amp; scienti non fit
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52420:97"/>
Injuria,</hi> No man receives injury in that, to which he willingly and knowingly agreeth and consenteth. But if she were no Recusant at the time of Marriage, and yet afterwards he suffer her to be corrupted and seduced, by admitting Priests and Romanists into his house, good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son likewise that he, be he Papist or Protestant, should pay for his negligence and misgovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Concerning the Petitions for Wife, for Children, for Sisters, &amp;c. O how he doth now put on the bowels of Nature and Compassion in the peril of his private and domestical estate! But before, when the publick state of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, when the King, the Queen, the tender Princes, the Nobles, the whole Kingdom, were designed to a perpetual destruction, Where was then this piety, this Religious affection, this care? All Nature, all Humanity, all respect of Laws both Divine and Humane, were quite abandoned; then was there no conscience made to extirpate the whole Nation, and all for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended zeal to the Catholick Religion, and the justification of so detestable and damnable a Fact.</p>
                     <p>Here did Sir <hi>Everard Digby</hi> interrupt Mr. Attorney, and said, that he did not justifie the fact, but confessed, that he deserved the vilest death, and most severe punishment that might be; but he was an humble Petitioner for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and some moderation of Justice. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mr. Attorney repli'd, that he should not look by the King to be honoured in the manner of his death, having so far abandoned all Religion and Humanity in his Action; but
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52420:98"/>
that he was rather to admire the great modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and mercy of the King, in that, for so exorbitant a crime, no new torture answerable thereunto was devised to be inflicted upon him. And for his Wife and Children, whereas he said, that for the Catholik Cause he was content to neglect the ruine of himself, his Wife, his Estate, and all; he should have his desire as 'tis in the Psalm, <hi>Let his Wife be a widow, and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vagabonds; let his posterity be destroyed, and in the next generation let his name be quite put out.</hi> For the paying of your Creditors, it is equal and just, but yet fit the King be first sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied and paid, to whom you owe so much, as that all you have is too little: yet these things must be left to the pleasure of his Majesty, and the course of Justice and Law.</p>

For hereof, by Letters intercepted in their passage into</hi> Scotland, <hi>the Records and Proofs are evident. His Majesty, so long as he was in expectation of that which by the work and grace of God he doth now possess, did ever seek to settle his establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Faith of Protestants in generality, as the most assured Shoot-Anchor. For though he found a number on the other side, as faithful and as well affected to his Person, Claim, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, as any men alive, as well in respect of their dependency upon the Queen his Mother, as for the taste which they had of the sweetness of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; yet finding with what strength of blood many have been over-carried out of a fervency in zeal in former times, observing to what censures they were subject, both in points of Faith, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of Loyalty; And last of all, forecasting to what end their former Protestation would come, when present satisfaction should shrink, he was ever fearful to embark himself for any further voyage and adventure in this Streight, than his own Compass might stear him, and his Iudgment level him.</hi>

He did confess, that in very deed, to keep up the hearts of Catholicks in love and duty to their King, he had imparted the Kings words to many in a better tune, and a higher kind of descant, than his Book of Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>song did direct; because he knew that others,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52420:102"/>
like slie Barge-men, looked that way, when their stroke was bent another way. For this he craved pardon of the King in humble manner, and for his main Treasons of a higher nature than these Figures of Hypocrisie; and seemed penitent, as well for the horrour of his crime, as for the fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of his whisperings.</hi>

                                    <hi>It hindered not the satisfaction which may be given to</hi> Percy'<hi>s shadow (the most desperate</hi> Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefeu <hi>in the pack) that as he died impenitent, for any thing we know, so likewise he died silent in the particulars: For first, it is not strange, that such a Traitor should devise so scandalous a slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der out of the malice of his heart, intending to destroy the King by any means, and to advance all means that might remove obstructions and impediments to the plot of Gun-powder. The more odious that he could make him to the Party Male-content, and the more sharply that he could set the Party Male-content upon the point and humour of revenge, the stronger was his hope at the giving of the last blow, to be glorifi'd and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifi'd. But touching the truth of the matters, it will be witnessed by many, that this Traitor</hi> Percy, <hi>after both the first and second return from the King, brought to the Catholicks no spark of comfort, of encouragement, of hope; whereof no stronger proof of argument doth need, than that</hi> Fawkes <hi>and others were employed both into</hi> Spain <hi>and other parts, for the reviving of a practise suspended and covered, after</hi> Percy'<hi>s coming back, as in likelihood they should not have been, in case he had returned with a branch of Olive in his mouth, or yielded any ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to resolve upon.</hi>

                        </note> to that point of his Majesties breaking of promise with Recusants, which was used and urged by Sir <hi>Everard Digby,</hi> as a motive to draw him to participate in this so hideous a Treason: <hi>Wherein his Lordship, after acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, that Sir</hi> Everard Digby <hi>was his Ally; And having made a zealous and Religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, concerning the sincerity and truth of that which he would deliver; shortly and clearly defended the honour of the King herein, and freed his Majesty from all imputation and scandal of Irresolution in Religion, and in the constant and perpetual maintaining thereof; as also from having at any time given the least hope, much less promise of Toleration. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he declared, how his Majesty, as well before his coming to this Crown, as at that very time, and always since, was so far from making of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, or giving hope of Toleration, that he ever
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52420:103"/>
professed he should not endure the very motion thereof from any.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And here his Lordship shewed what was done at</hi> Hampton-Court <hi>at the time of</hi> Watson'<hi>s Treason, where some of the greater Recusants were convented; and being found then not to have their fingers in Treason, were sent away again with encouragement to persist in their dutiful carriage, and with promise onely of thus much favour, That those mean profits which had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred since the Kings time to his Majesty for their Recusancy, should be forgiven to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Gentlemen, who had both at his Entry shewed so much Loyalty, and had kept themselves so free since from all Conspiracies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Then did his Lordship also (the rather to shew how little truth Sir</hi> Everard Digby'<hi>s words did carry in any thing which he had spoken) plainly prove, That all his protestations, wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied so constantly to be privy to the Plot of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, were utterly false, by the testimony of</hi> Fawkes <hi>(there present at the Bar) who had confessed, That certain moneths before that Session, the said</hi> Fawkes <hi>being with</hi> Digby <hi>at his house in the Countrey, about what time there had fallen much wet;</hi> Digby <hi>taking</hi> Fawkes <hi>aside after Supper, told him, That he was much afraid that the Powder in the Cellar was grown dank, and that some new must be provided, lest that should not take fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Next, the said Earl did justly and greatly commend the Lord</hi> Mounteagle, <hi>for his Loyal and honourable care of his Prince and Countrey, in the speedy bringing forth of the Letter sent unto him, wherein he said, That he had shewed
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52420:103"/>
both his discretion and fidelity. Which Speech be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended,</hi> Digby <hi>then acknowledged, That he spake not that of the breach of promise out of his own knowledge, but from their Relation whom he trusted, and namely from Sir</hi> Tho. Tresham.</p>
                     <p>NOw were the Jury returned, who having returned their Verdict, whereby they joyntly found those seven Prisoners, Arraigned upon the former Indictment, Guilty, Serjeant <hi>Philips</hi> craved Judgment against those Seven upon their Conviction; and against Sir <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard Digby</hi> upon his own Conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>Then the Lord Chief Justice of <hi>England,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a grave and prudent Relation and Defence of the Laws made by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> against Recusants, Priests, and Receivers of Priests, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the several occasions, progresses, and reasons of the same; and having plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated and proved, that they were all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, mild, equal, moderate, and to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to all the world, pronounced Judgment.</p>
                     <p>Upon the rising of the Court, Sir <hi>Everard Digby</hi> bowing himself towards the Lords, said, If I may but hear any of your Lordships say, you forgive me, I shall go more chearfully to the Gallows. Whereunto the Lords said, God forgive you, and we do.</p>
                     <p>And so according to the Sentence, on <hi>Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> following, execution was done upon Sir <hi>Everard Digby, Robert Winter, Iohn Graunt,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Bates,</hi> at the West end of <hi>Pauls</hi> Church; and on the <hi>Friday</hi> following, upon <hi>Thomas Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Ambrose Rookwood, Robert Keyes,</hi> and <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <head>The effect of that which Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Coke,</hi> Knight, His Majesties Attorney General, said at the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment of <hi>Henry Garnet,</hi> Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the Iesuits in <hi>England,</hi> as near to his own words as the same could be taken.</head>
                     <p>YOur Lordships may perceive by the parts of the Indictment, which have been succinctly opened, that this is but a latter Act of that heavy and woful Tragedy, which is commonly called the Powder-treason, wherein some have already played their parts, and, according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits, suffered condign punishment and pains of death. We are now to proceed against this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner for the same Treason; in which respect, the necessary repetition of some things before spoken, shall at the least seem tolerable: for that <hi>Nunquam nimis dicitur, quod nunquam satis dicitur,</hi> It is never said too often, that can never be said enough: Nay, it may be thought justifiable to repeat in this case, for that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the confluence and access of people, at the former Arraignment, many could not hear at that time. And yet because I fear it would be tedious, for that most of all my Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, and of this Honourable and Great Assembly, were present at the Arraignment, and for that I am now to deal with a man of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52420:107"/>
quality, I will onely touch, and that very little, of the former Discourse or Evidence, and that little also shall be mingled with such new matter as shall be worth the hearing, as being indeed of weight and moment; and all this with very great brevity.</p>
                     <p>But before I further proceed to the opening of this so great a Cause, I hold it fit and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to give satisfaction to two divers and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse sorts of men, who according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers affections of their hearts, have divined and conjectured diversly of the cause of the procrastination and delay of proceeding, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially against this person, the matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he stands charged being so transcendant and exorbitant as it is. The first sort of these, out of their hearty love and loyalty to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Liege Lord and King, and to their dear Countrey, and this State, have feared the issue of this delay, lest that others might be animated by such protraction of Judgment, to perpetrate the like: For they say, (and it is most true) <hi>Quia non profertur citò contra malos sententia, abs<expan>
                              <am>

                        <hi>ullo filii hominum perpetrant mala:</hi> Because speedy Justice is not executed against wicked men, the people without all fear commit wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness. And pity it were that these good men should not be satisfied. The other sort are of those, who in respect no greater expedition hath been used against this Prisoner at the Bar, fall to excusing of him, as gathering these presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions and conjectures: First, that if he, or any of the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> had indeed been justly to be touched with this most damnable and damned Treason, surely they should have been brought
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52420:107"/>
forth and tried before this time. Secondly, that there was a Bill exhibited in Parliament concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Treason, and this Traitor, but that it was deferred, and proceeded not for want of just and sufficient proofs. Nay, thirdly, there was a particular Apology spread abroad for this man, and another general for all <hi>Iesuits</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> together with this imputation, That King-killing, and Queen-killing was not indeed a Doctrine of theirs, but onely a Fiction and Policy of our State, thereby to make the Popish Religion to be despised, and in disgrace. Now for these men, pity it were, that the eye of their understanding should not be enlightned and cleared, that so being by demonstrative and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent proofs convinced, they may be to their Prince and Countrey truly converted. First therefore concerning the delay, (though it be true, <hi>Quod flagellatur in corde, qui laudatur in ore)</hi> yet must I remember the great pains of my Lords the Commissioners of his Majesties Privy Council, in this cause for <hi>Garnet,</hi> being first examined upon the <hi>13th.</hi> of the last moneth, hath sithence been again examined and interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated above twenty several times, which lasted unto the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> within two days of this Arraignment. Touching the Bill in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, it was indeed exhibited before <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> was apprehended: but his Majesties gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pleasure was, That albeit this Treason be without all president and example, yet they should quietly and equally be Indicted, Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, publickly heard, and proceeded withall in a moderate, ordinary, and just course of Law. Concerning their Apologies, and the Fictions
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52420:108"/>
of State (as they term them) answer shall be made, by Gods grace, in the proper place, when I come to lay open the plots and practises of the Jesuits, to the satisfaction of all this Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and Great Assembly. But first I have an humble Petition to present to your Lordships, and the rest of this grave Auditory, for my self, in respect that I am necessarily to name great Princes; yet with protestation and caution, that no blot is intended to be laid upon any of them. I know there is <hi>Lex in sermone tenenda,</hi> a Law and Rule to be observ'd in speaking, especially in this kind; and that Kings and great Princes, and the mighty Men of this earth, are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently and respectfully dealt withall. And therefore I humbly recommend unto you these Considerations, concerning this point of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning these Forein States. First, That the Kingdoms were at those times in open enmity and hostility, and that might be honourable at one time which was not so at another; so that hostile actions were then justifiable and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as being in times of Hostility and War. Secondly, in these things, it is not the Kings Attorney that speaks, but <hi>Garnet</hi> the <hi>Iesuit:</hi> as also, that it proceedeth from an inevitable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, for that the Examinations as well of this, as of the rest of the Traitors, cannot otherwise be opened and urged against them: so is the mention of great men by the impudency of these wicked Traitors, woven into their Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, as they cannot be severed.</p>
                     <p>And with this comfort I conclude the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, That I hope in God, this days work, in the judgment of so many as shall be attentive
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52420:108"/>
and well disposed, shall tend to the glory of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, the honour of our Religion, the safety of his most Excellent Majesty and his Royal Issue, and the security of the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
                     <p>For Memory and Method, all that I shall speak may be contracted to two general Heads: First, I will consider the Offences, together with certain Circumstances,

                           <l>Precedent before the offence.</l>
                           <l>Concurrent with the offence.</l>
                           <l>Subsequent after the offence.</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, I will lay down some observations concerning the same.</p>
                     <p>For the proper name of this offence, because I must speak of several Treasons, for distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and separation of this from the other, I will name it the Jesuits Treason, as belonging to them, both <hi>ex congruo &amp; condigno,</hi> They were the Proprietaries, Plotters, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curers of it; and in such crimes, <hi>plus peccat Author quàm Actor,</hi> the Author or Procurer of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth more, than the Actor or Executor, as may appear by Gods own judgment given against the first sin in Paradise, where the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent had three punishments inflicted upon him, as the Original Plotter; the Woman two, being as the immediate Procurer; and <hi>Adam</hi> but one, as the Party seduced.</p>
                     <p>Circumstances precedent and subsequent, so termed here, are indeed in their proper natures all high Treasons, but yet in respect of the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, nay, monstrousness of this Treason, may comparatively, without any discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to them in this case, be used as Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52420:109"/>
And because I am to deal with the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior of the Jesuits, I will onely touch such Treasons, as have been plotted and wrought by the Jesuits, of whom this man was Superiour, and those Treasons also sithens this <hi>Garnet</hi> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>England,</hi> whereof he may truly say, <hi>Et quorum pars magna fui.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The coming of this <hi>Garnet</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> (which very act was a Treason) was about twenty years past, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1586. in the <hi>28th.</hi> year of the Reign of the late Queen of famous and blessed memory; whereas the year before, namely the <hi>27th.</hi> year of <hi>Eliz.</hi> there was a Statute made, whereby it was Treason for any, who was made a Romish Priest by any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> sithens the first year of her Reign, to come into her Dominions. Which Statute the Romanists calumniate as a bloody, cruel, unjust, and a new upstart Law; and abuse that place of our Saviour, <hi>O Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Ierusalem, thou that killest the Prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, &amp;c.</hi> to <note place="margin">Matth. 23. 37.</note> that purpose. But indeed it is both mild, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, and just, and grounded upon the ancient fundamental Laws of <hi>England.</hi> For (as hath already in the former Arraignments been touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) before the Bull of <hi>Impious Pius Quintus,</hi> in the <hi>11th.</hi> year of the Queen, wherein her Majesty was Excommunicated and Deposed, and all they accursed who should yield any obedience unto her, &amp;c. there were no Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants in <hi>England,</hi> all came to Church, (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Popishly inclined, or persuaded in most points) to the same Divine Service we now use: but thereupon presently they refused to assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52420:109"/>
in our Churches, or joyn with us in publick Service, not for conscience of any thing there done, against which they might justly except out of the Word of God, but because the Pope had Excommunicated and Deposed her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and cursed those who should obey her: and so upon this Bull ensued open Rebellion in the North, and many Garb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ils. But see the event: Now most miserable in respect of this Bull was the state of Romish Recusants, for either they must be hanged for Treason, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting their lawful Sovereign, or cursed for yielding the due obedience unto her Majesty. And therefore of this Pope it was said by some of his own favourits, that he was <hi>Homo pius &amp; doctus, sed nimis credulus,</hi> A holy and a learned man, but over credulous; for that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and believed, that the strength of the Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> was such, as was able to have resisted the Queen. But when the Bull was found to take such an effect, then was there a Dispensation given, both by <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> himself, and <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>13th.</hi> That all Catholicks here might shew their outward obedience to the Queen, <hi>ad redimendam vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem, &amp; ad ostendendam externam obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam;</hi> but with these cautions and limitations: 1. <hi>Rebus sic stantibus,</hi> things so standing as they did. 2. <hi>Donec publica Bullae executio fieri posset;</hi> that is to say, They might grow into strength, until they were able to give the Queen a Mate, that the publick execution of the said Bull might take place. And all this was confessed by <hi>Garnet</hi> under his own hand, and now again openly confessed at the Bar.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:52420:110"/>
In the <hi>20th.</hi> year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> came <hi>Campion</hi> the Jesuit, and many others of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession with him, purposely to make a Party in <hi>England</hi> for the Catholick cause, to the end that the Bull of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> might be put in execution. And though all this while Recusancy being grounded upon such a disloyal Cause, were a very dangerous and disloyal thing; yet was there no Law made in that behalf until the <hi>23d.</hi> year of her Majesties Reign. And that also imposing onely a Mulct or Penalty upon it, until conformity were offered and shewed. <hi>Anno 26 Eliz.</hi> came <hi>Parry</hi> with a resolution from Cardinal <hi>de Como</hi> and others, that it was lawful to kill her Majesty, as being Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated and Deposed. Whereupon her Majesty entring into consultation how (together with her safety, and the protection of her Subjects) she might avoid the imminent dangers, and yet draw no blood from these Priests and Jesuits, found out this moderate and mild course, as the best means to prohibit their coming at all into her Land, there never being any King who would endure, or not execute any such persons within their Dominions, as should deny him to be lawful King, or go about to withdraw his Subjects from their Allegiance, or incite them to resist or rebel against him. Nay, the bringing in of a Bull by a Subject of this Realm against another, in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the first, was adjudged Treason. But by the way, for that <hi>Garnet</hi> hath exclaimed, saying, Shew us where was your Church before <hi>Luther,</hi> design the place, name the persons, and so forth; it is answered, by a comparison of a Wedge of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52420:110"/>
pure Gold, which coming into the hands of Impostors, is, by their sophistications and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for gain and worldly respects, increased and augmented into a huge body and mass, and retaining still an outward fair shew andtincture of Gold. Where is now the pure Gold, saith one? shew me the place. I answer, In that mass, but for the extracting thereof, and purifying it from dross, that must be done by the Art of the Workman, and the Trial of the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone. So the true Religion and Service of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, being, for humane respects, and worldly pomp, mixed and over-laden with a number of superstitious Ceremonies and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of man; yet ever had God his true Church holding his truth, which hath been by skilful Workmen, with the Touch-stone of the Word of God, refined and separate from the Dross of mans Inventions.</p>
                     <p>But to proceed. In the <hi>28th.</hi> year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> being the year of our Lord 86. in <hi>Iune,</hi> came <hi>Garnet</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> breaking through the Wall of Treason, being in truth, <hi>Totus compositus ex proditione.</hi> And this was at that time, when the great Armado of <hi>Spain,</hi> which the Pope blessed and Christened by the name of, <hi>The Invincible Navy,</hi> was, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation of that high Priest of <hi>Rome,</hi> preparing and collecting together of many parcels, out of divers parts, where they could be bought, or hired, or borrowed, and therefore may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, A compounded Navy, having in it 158 great Ships. The Purveyors and Fore-runners of this Navy and Invasion, were the Jesuits, and <hi>Garnet</hi> among them, being a Traitor even
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52420:111"/>
in his very entrance and footing in the Land. But the Queen, with her own Ships, and her own Subjects, did beat this Armado, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (whose cause indeed it was) fighting for us against them, by Fire, and Seas, and Winds, and Rocks, and Tempests, scattering all, and destroying most of them. For, <hi>Offenso Creatore, offenditur omnis creatura,</hi> the Creator being offended, every Creature is readily armed to revenge his quarrel; in which respect he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, The Lord of Hosts. So that of 158, scarce 40 of their Ships returned to the Bar of their own Haven; and it is reported, most of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so perished. Insomuch that in this respect, we may say of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as the Poet writeth of the Christian Emperor,
<q>
                           <l>O nimium dilecta Deo, cui militat aether,</l>
                           <l>Et conjuratt veniunt ad classica venti.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Observe here, that about the time of this Invasion, there being in <hi>Spain</hi> met in consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation about that business, the Cardinal of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Medina,</hi> Count <hi>Fuentes,</hi> two <hi>Irish</hi> Bishops, with sundry Military men, and amongst others, <hi>Winslade</hi> an <hi>Englishman;</hi> The <hi>Irish</hi> Bishops perceiving that they expected a Party of Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> resolved, that true it was, that it was not possible to do any good here in <hi>England,</hi> unless there were a Party of Catholicks made before-hand. But such, said they, was the policy of <hi>England,</hi> as that could never be effected; for if any suspicion or fear arose, the Catholicks should quickly be either shut up, or quite cut off. Oh, saith an old Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52420:111"/>
there present, <hi>Hoc facit pro nobis,</hi> that makes for us; for by that means their Souls shall go to Heaven for their Religion, their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the Earth for their Treason, and their Lands and Goods to us as Conquerors: and this was that indeed they principally aimed at. Note here, that sithence the Jesuits set foot in this Land, there never passed four years with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a most pestilent and pernicious Treason, tending to the subversion of the whole State. After that hostile Invasion in 88. the Jesuits fell again to secret and treasonable practises; for then, in the year 92, came <hi>Patrick Cullen,</hi> who was incited by Sir <hi>William Stanley, Hugh Owen, Iaques Fraunces,</hi> and <hi>Holt</hi> the Jesuit, and resolved by the said <hi>Holt</hi> to kill the Queen; to which purpose he received Absolution, and then the Sacrament at the hands of the said Jesuit, together with this ghostly counsel, That it was both lawful and meritorious to kill her. Nay, said <hi>Iaques,</hi> that base Landress Son, (who was a continual practiser both with this <hi>Cullen</hi> and others, to destroy her Majesty) The State of <hi>England</hi> is, and will be so setled, that unless Mistris <hi>Elizabeth</hi> be suddenly taken away, all the Devils in Hell will not be able to prevail against it, or shake it.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Cullen</hi>'s Treason was accompanied with a Book called <hi>Philopater,</hi> written for the abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and warranting of such a devilish act in general by <hi>Creswel</hi> the Legier Jesuit in <hi>Spain,</hi> under the name of <hi>Philopater. Anno</hi> 94. came <hi>Williams</hi> and <hi>York</hi> to the same end, <hi>viz.</hi> to kill the Queen, being wrought to undertake so vile and detestable a fact by Father <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>lt</hi> the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52420:112"/>
Jesuit, and other his complices; And thereupon the said <hi>Willams</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> in the Jesuits Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge received the Sacrament together of father <hi>Holt,</hi> and other <hi>Iesuits,</hi> to execute the same. And that Treason likewise was accompanied with a Book written by the legier <hi>Iesuit</hi> and <hi>Rector</hi> at <hi>Rome, Parsons,</hi> under the name of <hi>Doleman,</hi> concerning Titles, or rather tittles: a lewd and a lying book, full of falshood, forgery and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction. Anno 97. came <hi>Squire</hi> from <hi>Spain,</hi> to poyson her Majesty, incited, directed, and warranted by <hi>Walpole</hi> a <hi>Iesuit,</hi> then residing there: at whose hands likewise, after absolution, he received the Sacrament, as well to put the practise in execution, as to keep it secret. All these Treasons were freely and voluntarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by the parties themselves, under their own hands, and yet remain extant to be seen.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1601. when practises failed, then was Force again attempted; For then (as in the former Arraignment hath been declared) was <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> imployed to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> together with <hi>Tesmond</hi> the Jesuit, by this <hi>Garnet,</hi> who wrote his Letters to <hi>Arthur</hi> alias <hi>Ioseph Creswell,</hi> (the only man whom I have heard of to change his Christian name) the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier Jesuit in <hi>Spain,</hi> for the furtherance of that negotiation, which was, as hath been said, To offer the services of the <hi>English</hi> Catholicks to the King, and to deal further concerning an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion, with promise from the Catholicks here, of forces, both of men and horses, to be in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to joyn with him. This negotiation by the means of <hi>Creswel,</hi> to whom <hi>Garnet</hi> wrote, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ook such effect, that the two kingdoms standing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52420:112"/>
then in hostlity, the proposition of the <hi>English Romish</hi> Catholicks was accepted and entertained, an army to Invade (as hath been specified in the former Arraignment) promised, and 100000. Crowns to be distributed amongst <hi>Romanists</hi> and discontented persons, making of a party in <hi>England,</hi> and for the furtherance of the said ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice granted. In the mean time the King ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desired, That if the Queen of <hi>England</hi> should happen to die, he might receive present and certain Advertisemene thereof.</p>
                     <p>Now this Treason was accompanied with the <note place="margin">Clem. 8.</note> Popes own writing. For now doth the Holy Father cause to be sent hither to <hi>Garnet</hi> two Briefs or Buls, one to the Clergy, and another to the Laity: wherein observe the Title, the Matter, the Time. The Title of the one was, <hi>Dilectis filijs, Principibus, &amp; Nobilibus Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licis Anglicanis, Salutem &amp; Apostolicam bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionem:</hi> that is, To our beloved sons the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Gentlemen of <hi>England,</hi> which are Catholicks, Greeting, and Apostolical bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. The title of the other was, <hi>Dilectis filijs Archipresbytero, &amp; reliquo Clero Anglicano, &amp;c.</hi> To our beloved sons, the Archpriest, and the rest of the Catholik Clergy. The matter was, that after the death of her Majesty, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by course of Nature or otherwise, whosoever should lay claim or Title to the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> though never so directly &amp; neerly interested therein, by Descent and Blood Royal, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he were such an one as would not onely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate the Catholick <hi>(Romish)</hi> Religion, but by all his best endeavours and force promote it, and according to the ancient custom, would by a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52420:113"/>
solemn and sacred Oath religiously promise and undertake to perform the same, they should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or receive none to be King of <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> His words are these, <hi>Quantumcunque propinqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate sanguinis niterentur, nisi ejusmodi essent, qui fidem Catholicam non modò tolerarent, sed omni ope ac studio promoverent, &amp; more Majorum Iurejurando se id praestituros susciperent, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>As for King <hi>Iames</hi> (at whom the Pope aimed) he hath indeed both <hi>Propinquitatem,</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitatem Regalis sanguinis,</hi> Propinquity and Antiquity of blood Royal, for his just Claim and Title to this Crown both before and since the Conquest.

And lastly his Majesty cometh of <hi>Margaret</hi> also the eldest daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th. who was descended of that famous Union of those two fair Roses, the White and the Red, <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> the effecting of which union cost the effusion of much <hi>English</hi> blood, over and besides four-score or thereabouts of the Blood-Royal. But a more famous Union is, by the goodness of the Almighty, perfected in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties person, of divers Lions, two Famous, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and Renowned Kingdoms, not onely without bloud, or any opposition, but with such an universal acclamation and applause of all sorts and degrees, (as it were with one voice) as never was seen or read of. And therefore, most Excellent King, for to him I will now speak,

                     <p>These four Noble and Magnanimous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so firmly and undividually united, are able, without any difficulty or great labour, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and overthrow all the Letters and Bulls (and their Calves also) that have been, or can be sent into <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now for the time observe, that these Bulls or Briefs came upon the aforesaid Negociation of <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> at what time an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my should shortly after have been sent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Land: and this was to be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, <hi>Quandocunque contingeret miseram illam foeminam ex hac vita excedere.</hi> Whensoever it
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52420:114"/>
should happen, that that miserable Woman (for so it pleased the High Priest of <hi>Rome</hi> to call Great Queen <hi>Elizabeth)</hi> should depart this life. Was Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> miserable? It is said, that <hi>Misera constat ex duobus contrarus, scilicet, Copia, &amp; Inopia: Ex copia tribulationis, &amp; inopia consolationis.</hi> Was she, I say, misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whom Almighty God so often and so mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously protected, both <hi>from the arrow that flieth by day,</hi> their great <hi>Armado;</hi> and <hi>from the Pestilence that walketh in the darkness,</hi> their secret and treacherous Conspiracies? That did beat her most potent Enemy? That set up a King in his Kingdom? That defended Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and harboured and protected distressed People? That protected her Subjects in peace and plenty, and had the hearts of the most and the best of her Subjects? That Reigned Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and Gloriously, and died Christianly and in peace? Oh blessed Queen, our late dear So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, <hi>Semper honos nomenque tuum laudesque manebunt.</hi> But Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, (for <hi>memoria ejus semper erit in benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione)</hi> as a bright Morning-Star, in the fulness of time, lost her natural light, when the great and glorious Sun appeared in our Horizon. And now sithence the coming of great King <hi>Iames,</hi> there have not passed, I will not say four years, but not four, nay, not two months, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some Treason. First, in <hi>March</hi> 1603. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the death of her Majesty, and before they had seen his Majesties face, was <hi>Christopher Wright</hi> employed into <hi>Spain</hi> by <hi>Garnet, Catesby,</hi> and <hi>Tresham,</hi> to give advertisement of the Queens death, and to continue the former Negotiation

of <hi>Thomas Winter.</hi> And by him also doth this <hi>Garnet</hi> write to <hi>Creswel</hi> the Jesuit in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and for assistance and furtherance of his business.</p>
                     <p>As also in the <hi>22d.</hi> of <hi>Iune</hi> following, was <hi>Guy Fawkes</hi> sent out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> by <hi>Baldwin</hi> the Jesuit, by Sir <hi>William Stanley,</hi> and <hi>Hugh Owen,</hi> about the same Treason; and by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from <hi>Baldwin,</hi> directed and commended to <hi>Creswel</hi> the Legier Jesuit in <hi>Spain,</hi> for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of his dispatch, as in the former Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath been declared. In the same <hi>Iune</hi> doth <hi>Garnet</hi> the Superiour, together with <hi>Gerrard</hi> and other Jesuits, and Jesuited Catholicks, labour, not onely in providing of Horses, which, by <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> and <hi>Christopher Wright,</hi> upon their several negotiations they, in the names of all the Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> had promised the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to assist and do him service withall, at such time as the said King should send Forces to invade, either at <hi>Milford-haven,</hi> or in <hi>Kent,</hi> as hath before been shewed: But also did, by force of the said two Bulls or Briefs, disswade the Romish Catholicks from yielding their due obedience to his Majesty, for that he was not of the Roman Religion, contrary to the practise of the true Church and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that undergo Wars, <hi>Ferendo, non ferien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> with patience, not with strokes, their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons being properly <hi>Orationes &amp; Lachrymae,</hi> Prayers and Tears.</p>
                     <p>In the same <hi>Iune</hi> 9. which was 1603. <hi>Primo Iacobi,</hi> brake out likewise the Treason of the Romish Priests, <hi>Watson</hi> and <hi>Clark;</hi> as also that other of Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> and others. But the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52420:115"/>
Jesuits seeing that the Peace was now in great forwardness; and having advertisement also, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> did now distaste their Propositions, so that there was no further hope left for force, then fell they again to secret practise. As for the Bulls or Briefs before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, when <hi>Catesby</hi> had informed <hi>Garnet,</hi> that King <hi>Iames</hi> was proclaimed, and the State setled; they were by <hi>Garnet,</hi> as himself hath affirmed, burnt. But to proceed. In <hi>March,</hi> 1603. <hi>Garnet</hi> and <hi>Catesby</hi> (a pestilent Traitor) confer together, and <hi>Catesby</hi> in general telleth him, (though most falsly) that the King had broken promise with the Catholicks, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore assuredly there would be stirs in <hi>England</hi> before it were long. In <hi>September</hi> following meets <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Thomas Piercy,</hi> and after an unjust, but a grievous complaint made by <hi>Cates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> of the Kings proceedings, for that contrary to their expectations, his Majesty both did hold, and was like continually to run the same course which the Queen before had held; <hi>Piercy</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently breaks forth into this devilish speech, That there was no way but to kill the King, which he the said <hi>Piercy</hi> would undertake to do. But <hi>Catesby,</hi> as being <hi>Versuto ingenio &amp; profunda perfidia,</hi> a cunning, a wily, and a deep Traitor, intending to use this so furious and fiery a Spirit to a further purpose, doth, as it were, stroke him for his great forwardness; yet with sage and stayed counsel tells him, No, <hi>Tom,</hi> thou shalt not adventure thy self to so small purpose; If thou wilt be a Traitor, there is a Plot to greater advantage, and such a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52420:115"/>
one as can never be discovered, <hi>viz.</hi> the Powder-Treason.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Ianuary,</hi> in the first year of his Majesty, <hi>Garnet</hi> took out a General Pardon under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> of all Treasons, which Pardon, his Majesty, of his Grace, granted to all men at his first entrance into his Kingdom, under the name of <hi>Henry Garnet</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Gent. but therein he never used any of his <hi>alias dictus Walley, Farmer,</hi> or any other of his feigned names. But <hi>Catesby</hi> fearing lest any of those whom he had or should take into Confederacy, being touched in Conscience with the horrour of so damnable a fact, might give it over, and endanger the discovery of the Plot, seeks to <hi>Garnet</hi> (as being the Sup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And therefore <hi>Catesby</hi> coming to <hi>Garnet,</hi> propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto him the Case, and asketh whether for the good and promotion of the Catholick cause against Hereticks (the necessity of time and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion so requiring) it be lawful or not, amongst many <hi>Nocents,</hi> to destroy and take away some <hi>Innocents</hi> also. To this question <hi>Garnet</hi> advised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and resolvedly answered, That if the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage were greater to the Catholick part by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away some <hi>Innocents</hi> together with many <hi>Nocents,</hi> then doubtless it should be lawful to kill and destroy them all: And to this purpose

he alledged a comparison of a Town or City which was possessed by an Enemy, If at the time of taking thereof there happen to be some few friends within the place, they must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the fortune of the Wars in the general and common destruction of the Enemy. And this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of <hi>Garnet</hi> the Superior of the Jesuits, was the strongest, and the onely bond, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Catesby</hi> afterwards kept and retained all the Traitors in that so abominable and detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Confederacy. For in <hi>March</hi> following, <hi>Catesby, Thomas Winter,</hi> and others, resolve upon the Powder-plot, and <hi>Fawkes,</hi> as being a man unknown, and withall a desperate person, and a Soldier, was resolved upon, as fit for the executing thereof; to which purpose he was, in <hi>April</hi> following, by <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> sought and fetched out of <hi>Flanders</hi> into <hi>England.</hi> In <hi>May,</hi> in the second year of his Majesty, <hi>Cates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, Percy, Iohn Wright, Thomas Winter,</hi> and <hi>Fawkes</hi> meet, and having upon the holy Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists taken an Oath of secresie and constancy to this effect;</p>

In <hi>Iune</hi> following <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Greenwel</hi> the Jesuit confer about the Powder-treason. And at Midsummer <hi>Catesby</hi> having speach with <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> of the Powder-treason; they said that it was so secret, as that it must prevail, before it could be discovered. Then <hi>Garnet</hi> seemed to desire that the Popes consent might be obtained; But <hi>Catesby</hi> answered, that he took that as granted by the Pope in the two Buls or Briefs before; For that said he, if it were lawfull not to receive, or to repell him, as the said Buls or Briefs did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, then it is lawfull also to expell or cast him out. Upon the <hi>7th.</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1604, was the Parliament Prorogued untill the <hi>7th.</hi> of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary;</hi> and in <hi>November</hi> following, <hi>Thomas Bates,</hi> being (as hath been declared more at large in the former Arraignment) fetched in by <hi>Catesby</hi> his master, to participate in the Powder-treason, for better assurance of his secrecy, and prosecution thereof, is by <hi>Greenwel</hi> the Jesuit confessed, encouraged and told, that being for a good cause, he might and ought not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it, as committed unto him in secret by his master, but further said, that it was no offence at all, but justifiable and good. About this time was <hi>Robert Keyes</hi> taken into the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy, and by <hi>Catesby</hi> resolved of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness thereof from the Jesuits.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>11th.</hi> of <hi>December</hi> they entred the Mine: and in <hi>March</hi> following, which was in 1605, was <hi>Guy Fawks</hi> sent over to Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi> with letterts from <hi>Garnet,</hi> ro <hi>Baldwine</hi> the Legier Jesuit there, to take order that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the time of the Blow, the forces might be brought near to the Sea side, to the end that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52420:117"/>
they might suddenly be transported into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And there doth <hi>Fawkes</hi> by consent of the confederates, give <hi>Owen</hi> the Oath of secrecy and perseverance, and then acquaints him with the whole Treason: Who having been a most malicious and inveterate Traitor, greatly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded it, and gave his consent and counsel for the furtherance thereof. In <hi>May</hi> 1605, fell out certain Broils in <hi>Wales</hi> by the Romish Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, at what time also <hi>Rookewood</hi> was by <hi>Catesby</hi> acquainted with the Powder-treason, and resolved of the lawfulness of the fact by him as from the Jesuits. Now doth <hi>Garnet</hi> write to the Pope, that commandment might come from his Holiness, or els from <hi>Aquaviva</hi> the General of the Jesuits, for the staying of all commotions of the Catholiques here in <hi>England,</hi> intending indeed to set their whole rest of the Catholique Romish cause, upon the Powder-plot, and in the mean time to lull us asleep in security, in respect of their dissembled quitness and conformity, as also least impediment might be offered to this main Plot by reason of any suspicion of the stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Papists, or of inquiry after them upon occasion of any petty commotions or broils. But when he further desired, that it might be so enjoyned upon censures, that latter request was not granted, least it might indeed be an impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Powder-plot.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Iune</hi> following doth <hi>Greenwel</hi> the Jesuit consult with <hi>Garnet</hi> his Superior, of the whole course of the Powder-treason at large. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in observe the politique and subtil dealing of this <hi>Garnet.</hi> First he would not (as he saith) confer of it with a lay man (other than <hi>Catesby</hi>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:52420:117"/>
whom he so much trusted) why so? because that might derogate from the reverence of his Place, That a Jesuit, and a Superior of them, should openly joyn with Laymen in cause of so much bloud; And therefore secondly, as he would consult of it with a Priest, and a Jesuit, one of his own order and his subject; so for his further security, he would consult thereof with <hi>Greenwel</hi> the Jesuit, as in a disguised confession. And being informed, that the discourse would be too long to repeat kneeling, he answered that he would consult with him of it in confession walking; and so accordingly in an ambulatory confession, he at large discoursed with him of the whole Plot of the Powder-treason; And that a Protector (after the Blow given) should be chosen out of such of the Nobility as should be warned and reserved.</p>
                     <p>In this Moneth likewise was there a great conference and consultation betwixt <hi>Garnet; Catesby,</hi> and <hi>Francis Tresham,</hi> concerning the strength of the Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> to the end that <hi>Garnet</hi> might by Letters send direct Advertisement thereof to the Pope; for that his Holiness would not be brought to shew his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination concerning any Commotion or rising of the Catholick part, until such time as he should be certainly informed that they had sufficient and able Force to prevail.</p>
                     <p>And in <hi>August</hi> following, <hi>Garnet,</hi> in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference had about acquainting of the Pope with the Powder-treason, named and appointed Sir <hi>Edmund Baynam</hi> for to carry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <pb n="98" facs="tcp:52420:118"/>
write Letters in that behalf; as also for staying of Commotions, under pain of Censures, well knowing that before his Letters could be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, the House of Parliament (according to their designs) should have been blown up, and the whole State overthrown. But this trick he used like a thief, that going to steal and take Partriches with a setting dog, doth rate his dog for questing or going too near, until he have laid his net over them, for fear the game should be sprung, and the purpose defeated.</p>
                     <p>In this Moneth also doth <hi>Garnet</hi> write to <hi>Baldwine</hi> the Legier Jesuit in the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, in the behalf of <hi>Catesby,</hi> that <hi>Owen</hi> should move the <hi>Marquess</hi> for a Regiment of horses for him the said <hi>Catesby,</hi> not with any intent, as it was agreed, that <hi>Catesby</hi> should undertake any such charge, but that under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of it, horses and other necessaries might be provided without suspition to furnish the Traitors.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>September</hi> following doth <hi>Parsons</hi> the Jesuit write to <hi>Garnet,</hi> to know the particulars of the <hi>Project</hi> in hand, for the journey to Saint <hi>Winifrides</hi> Well in this Moneth. It was but a Jergon, to have better opportunity by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour thereof, to confer and retire themselves to those parts.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>October</hi> doth <hi>Garnet</hi> meet the other Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors at <hi>Coughton</hi> in <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> which was the place of <hi>Rendevouz,</hi> whither they resorted out of all Countreys.</p>
                     <p>Upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>st of <hi>November, Garnet</hi> openly prayeth for the good success of the great Action, concerning the Catholick cause in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52420:118"/>
of the Parliament; and prayer is more then consent. For, <hi>Nemo orat sed qui sperat &amp; cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</hi> He in the prayer used two verses of a Hymn, <hi>Gentem auferte perfidam credentium de finibus, ut Christo laudes debitas persolvamus alacriter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now was the Letter with the Lord <hi>Mountegle,</hi> whose memory shall be blessed, on the fourth of <hi>November,</hi> by the providence of the Almighty, not many hours before the Treason should have been executed, was it fully discovered.</p>
                     <p>On the 5th of <hi>November,</hi> being the time when the Traitors expected that their devilish practise should have taken effect, they convented at <hi>Dunchurch</hi> under colour of a great hunting match, appointed by Sir <hi>Everard Dighy,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man of quality and accompt thereabout, purposing by this means to furnish themselves with company for their intended Insurrection and Rebellion; for that men being gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and a tumult suddenly raised, the Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors thought, that every or most of them would follow the present fortune, and be easily persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to take part with them, and that they might easily surprise the person of the Lady <hi>Elisabeth,</hi> then being in those parts, in the Lord <hi>Harring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> house.</p>
                     <p>Upon the 6th of <hi>November,</hi> early in the Morning, <hi>Catesby</hi> and the said Confederates dispatched <hi>Thomas Bates</hi> with a Letter to <hi>Garnet</hi> the superior of the Jesuits, who was (as they well knew) then ready at <hi>Coulton</hi> near unto them, earnestly intreating his help and assistance, for the raising of <hi>Wales,</hi> and putting so many as he could into open Rebellion. At what time <hi>Garnet,</hi> and <hi>Greenwell</hi> (who then of purpose was there
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52420:119"/>
with <hi>Garnet,)</hi> then certainly perceiving that the Plot was indeed discovered, and knowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be the chiefest Authors thereof, prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied the overthrow of the whole order of the Jesuits, saying that they feared that the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and miscarrying of this practice, would utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undo and overthrow the whole Society of the Jesuits. But <hi>Greenwel</hi> the Jesuit being carried with a more violent and firy spirit, posteth up and down, to incite such as he could to rise up in open Rebellion. And meeting in Master <hi>Abing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> house with <hi>Hall</hi> another Jesuit, adviseth him the said <hi>Hall</hi> likewise to loose no time, but forthwith to seek to raise and stir up so many as he could. But <hi>Hall</hi> seeming to deliberate thereof, whether seeing no end of so rash an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or fearing by that means to be himself apprehended, <hi>Tesmond</hi> told him that he was a Flegmatic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ellow, and said, A man may herein see the difference betwixt a Flegmatick man (such as he meant <hi>Hall</hi> was) and a Cholerick, as he said himself was; and further added, that he was resolved to do his best endevors for the raising of a Rebellion, under this false pretext and colour, That it was concluded that the throats of all the Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> should be cut. So persuading himself to incite them to take Arms for to stand upon their Guard and Defence; and with this device he posted away into the County of <hi>Lancaster:</hi> afterwards <hi>Hall</hi> the Jesuit, othertherwise called <hi>Oldcorn,</hi> being urged by <hi>Humphrey Littleton</hi> with the evil suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of their intended Treason, that surely God was displeased and offended with such bloody and barbarous courses, in stead of an humble
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52420:119"/>
acknowledgment of the Justice of God, and a sense of the wickedness of the Treason, fell ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Satanically to argue for the justification of the same, and said, Ye must not judge the cause by the event: for the eleven Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> were by God himself commanded to go and fight against <hi>Benjamin,</hi> yet were they twice overthrown. So <hi>Lewes</hi> of <hi>France</hi> fighting against the <hi>Turk,</hi> his Army was scattered, and himself died of the Plague. And lastly, the Christians defending the <hi>Rhodes,</hi> were by the <hi>Turks</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. And these he applyed to the Powder-treason, and persuaded <hi>Littleton</hi> not to judge it ungodly or unlawful by the event.</p>
                     <p>Observe here a double consequent of this Powder-treason: 1. Open Rebellion, as hath been shewed both immediately before, and more at large in the former Arraignment: and since that blasphemy in <hi>Garnet,</hi> the Superior of the Jesuits: for he having liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Tower to write, and sending a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (which Letter was openly shewed in the Court before him) to an acquaintance of his in the Gatehouse, there was nothing therein to be seen but ordinary matter, and for certain ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries: but in the Margent, which he made very great and spacious, and underneath where there remained clean paper, he wrote cunningly with the Juice of an Orange, or of a Lemmon, to publish his Innocency, and concerning his usage, and there denieth those things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had freely and voluntarily confessed, and said, that for the <hi>Spanish</hi> Treason, he was freed by his Majesties Pardon, and as for the Powder-treason, he hoped for want of proof against him,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52420:120"/>
to avoid that well enough: but concludeth blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemously, applying the words which were spoken of our blessed Saviour, to himself in this damnable Treason, and saith, <hi>Necesse est ut unus homo moriatur pro populo,</hi> It is necessary that one man die for the people; which words <hi>Caiphas</hi> spake of Christ. Wherein note his Prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Equivocation; for before the Lords Commissioners, he truly and freely confessed his Treasons, being (as himself under his own hand confessed) overwhelmed <hi>tanta nube testium,</hi> and yet <hi>ad faciendum populum,</hi> in his Letters which he wrote abroad, he cleareth himself of the Powder-Treason. And thus much concerning the two Circumstances subsequent, which were Rebellion and Blasphemy.</p>
                     <p>The Circumstances concurring, are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Persons offending and offended. For the principal Person offending here at the Bar, he is, as you have heard, a man of many names, <hi>Garnet, Wallye, Darcy, Roberts, Farmer, Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips:</hi> and surely I have not commonly known or observed a true man, that hath had so many false Appellations. He is by Countrey an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishman, by Birth a Gentleman, by Education a Scholar, afterwards a Corrector of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law Print, with Mr. <hi>Tottle</hi> the Printer, and now is to be corrected by the Law. He hath many Gifts and Endowments of Nature, by Art Learned, a good Linguist, and by Profession a Jesuit, and a Superior, as indeed he is Superior to all his Predecessors in devillish Treason; a Doctor of Jesuits, that is, a Doctor of five <hi>Dd.</hi> as, Dissimulation, Deposing of Princes, Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Kingdoms, Daunting and deterring of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52420:120"/>
Subjects, and Destruction. Their Dissimulation appeareth out of their Doctrine of Equivocation. Concerning which it was thought fit to touch something of that which was more copiously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the former Arraignment, in respect of the presence of <hi>Garnet</hi> there, who was the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior of the Jesuits in <hi>England,</hi> concerning the Treatise of Equivocation, seen and allowed by <hi>Garnet,</hi> and by <hi>Blackwell</hi> the Arch Priest, wherein under the pretext of the lawfulness of a mixt proposition to express one part of a mans mind, and retain another, people are indeed taught not only simple lying, but fearful and damnable Blasphemy. And whereas the Jesuits ask why we convict and condemn them not for Heresie; it is for that they will Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and so cannot that way be tryed or judged according to their words.</p>
                     <p>Now for the antiquity of Equivocation, it is indeed very old, within little more then 300. years after Christ, used by <hi>Arrius</hi> the Heretick, <note place="margin">Socrat. Hist.</note> who having in a general Counsel been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and then by the commandment of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the Emperor sent into Exile, was by the said Emperor upon instant intercession for him, and promise of his future conformity to the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> faith, recalled again: who returning home, &amp; having before craftily set down in writing his Heretical belief, &amp; put it into his bosom, when he came into the presence of the Emperor, and had the <hi>Nicene</hi> faith propounded unto him, and was thereupon asked, whether he then did indeed, and so constantly would hold that faith; he (clapping his hand upon his bosom where his paper lay) answered and vowed, that he did, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52420:121"/>
so would constantly profess and hold that Faith (laying his hand on his bosom where the paper of his Heresie lay) meaning fraudulently (by the way of Equivocation) that faith of his own, which he had written and carried in his bosom. For these <hi>Iusuits,</hi> they indeed make no vow of speaking truth, and yet even this Equivocating, and lying is a kind of unchasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, against which they vow and promise: For as it hath been said of old, <hi>Cor linguae faederat naturae sanctio, veluti in quodam certo Connubio: Ergo cum dissonent cor &amp; loquutio, Sermo concipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in Adulterio,</hi> that is, The law and Sanction of Nature, hath (as it were) married the heart and tongue, by joyning and knitting of them together in a certain kind of marriage; and therefore when there is discord between them two, the speech that proceeds from them, is said to be conceived in Adultery; and he that breeds such bastard children, offends against Chastity. But note the heavy and wofull fruit of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Equivocation. <hi>Francis Tresham</hi> being near his natural death in the Tower, had of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity his wife permitted (for his comfort) to come unto him: who understanding that her husband had before directly and truly accused <hi>Garnet</hi> of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Treason, least belike her husband should depart this life, with a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that he had revealed any thing concerning the Superior of the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> a very little before he died, drew him to this, that his own hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so feeble as that he could not write himself, yet he caused his servant then attending on him, to write that which he did dictate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in protested upon his salvation, that he had not
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52420:121"/>
seen the said <hi>Garnet</hi> of 16. years before, and thereupon prayed that his former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to the contrary might in no wise take place. And that this paper of his Retractation which he had weakly, and dyingly subscribed, might after his death be delivered to the Earl of <hi>Salisbury:</hi> Whereas Master <hi>Garnet</hi> himself hath clearly confessed the <hi>Spanish</hi> Treason, and now acknowledged the same at the Bar; and he and Mistress <hi>Vaux</hi> and others directly confess and say, that <hi>Garnet</hi> and <hi>Tresham</hi> had within two years space been very often together, and also many times before. But <hi>Qualis vita, finis ita.</hi> And <hi>Garnet</hi> himself being at the Bar afterwards, urged to say what he thought of such the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of <hi>Francis Tresham</hi> out of this life, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered only this, I think he meant to Equivocate. Thus were they stayned with their own works, and went a whoring with their own Inventions, as it is in the Psalm. So that this is indeed <hi>Gens perfida,</hi> according to the Hymn, a perfidious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and therefore <hi>Iurat? crede minùs, non Iurat? credere noli. Iurat, non Iurat hostis, ab hoste cave.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For their Doctrine of Deposing of Princes, <hi>Simanca</hi> and <hi>Philopater</hi> are plain (as hath in the former Arraignment been more amply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and was now again at large to <hi>Garnets</hi> face repeated.) If a Prince be an Heretick, then he is Excommunicated, Cursed, and Deposed, his children deprived of all their Right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, himself not to be restored to his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Estate upon repentance; and by an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick they profess that he is intended and meant, namely, whosoever doth not hold the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Nay there is an easier
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52420:122"/>
and a more expedite way then all these to fetch off the Crown from off the head of any King Christened whatsoever, which is this, That <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps indulgendo haereticis amittit Regnum,</hi> If any Prince shall but tolerate or favour Hereticks, he loseth his Kingdom: Nay whereas <hi>Garnet</hi> in defence of this usurped power of the high Priest of <hi>Rome,</hi> alledged, <hi>Nos Sanctorum, &amp;c.</hi> out of the Decretals, in the very next Title before that, there is another Decree that passeth all we have recited, wherein it is shewed, that <hi>Zachary</hi> the Pope deposed <hi>Childerick</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> for nothing else there specified, <hi>Sed quia Inutilis,</hi> but onely for that he was reputed unprofitable to Govern.</p>
                     <p>Now as concerning their daunting and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Subjects, which is a part of the Jesuits profession: It were good that they would know &amp; remember, how that the most Noble &amp; famous Kings of <hi>England,</hi> never were afraid of Popes Bulls, no not in the very midnight of Popery, as <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, <hi>Hen. 1. Edw. 1. Ric. 2. Hen. 5. Hen. 4. &amp;c.</hi> And in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, and in all their times, the Popes Legate never passed <hi>Callis,</hi> but stayed there, and came not to <hi>England,</hi> untill he had taken a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Oath to do nothing to the detriment of the Crown or State.</p>
                     <p>For the persons offended, they were these: First the King, of whom I have spoken often, but never enough: A King of High and most Noble ancient descent, as hath been briefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and in himself full of all Imperial ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; Religion, Justice, Clemency, Learning, Wisdom, Memory, Affability, and the rest.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52420:122"/>
Then the Queen, and she in respect of her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py fruitfulness, is a great blessing, in so much that of her in that respect, may be said that she is, <hi>Ortu magna, viro major, sed maxima Prole,</hi> Great in Birth, Greater in her Marriage, but to all posterity greatest in the blessed fruit of her Womb, as having brought forth the greatest Prince that ever <hi>England</hi> had. 3 The Noble Prince, of whom we may say with the Poet, <hi>Quae te tam laeta tulere secula? qui tanti ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem genuere parentes?</hi> Never Prince, true heir Apparent to the Imperial Crown, had such a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor ever King had such a son.

Hold up thy head (Noble City) and advance thy self, for that never was thy Brow blotted with the least taint or touch, or suspicion of Disloyalty: Thou mayest truly say with the Prophet <hi>David, I will take no wicked thing in hand, I hate the sin of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulness, there shall no such cleave unto me:</hi> Therefore for thy Fidelity thou art honoured with the Title of <hi>THE KINGS CHAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BER,</hi> as an inward place of his greatest safety: And for thy comfort and joy this day, hath <hi>BRITAINS</hi> great King honoured thee with the proceeding upon this great and Honourable Commission, after the heavy and dolefull Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours

this other day, when it was certainly known that King <hi>IAMES</hi> was in safety, well did the fidelity of this City appear, (whereof I was an eye-witness) <hi>Vna voce conclamaverunt omnes, Salva Londinum, salva Patria, salva Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio; Iacobus Rex noster salvus:</hi> Our City, our Countrey, our Religion is safe, for our King <hi>IAMES</hi> is in safety.</p>
                     <p>The observations are many, and only in a word to be touched. The first is, that in the Spanish Treason before mentioned, and this Powder-treason, there was the same order, cause, and end. The order was, first to deal by secret practise and Treason, and then by force and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion. The cause which they pretend, was the Romish Catholick Religion. The end was the finall destruction of the Royal succession, yea even <hi>Occidere regnum,</hi> to overthrow and dissolve the whole Kingdom.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Note, that even the Enemy hath acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that our State is so setled and established, as neither strength nor Stratagem can prevail, unless there be a party made in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. We shall never have Bull more to come from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> because they shall never have a party strong enough to incounter with so many Lions.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. All their Canons, Decrees, and new-found Doctrines tend to one of these two ends: either worldly pride, or wicked policy, for the ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and inlargement of the Popes authority, and for the safety of the Jesuits, Priests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Observe that <hi>Baynam,</hi> a Layman, and one of the Damned crue, and so naming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, was sent to inform the Pope as a temporal Prince.</p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:52420:124"/>
6. I conceive their fall to be near at hand, both by Divinity and by Philosophy. For the first, there are now in <hi>England</hi> about 400. Priests: so many were there in Israel in the days of <hi>Achab.</hi> Who, saith God, <hi>shall go and deceive</hi> Achab, <hi>that he may fall?</hi> a lying spirit in the mouths of his 400. Prophets undertook and effected it; their fall was near, when once a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit had possessed the Priests, according to the vision of <hi>Micheas,</hi> as now it hath possessed the Jesuits. 2. The imitation of good for the most part comes short of the pattern: but the imitation of evill ever exceeds the example. Now no imitation can exceed this fact, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their time is at an end.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Many condemn it now, that would have commended it, if it had taken effect, for this, say they, is <hi>Enumero eorum quae non laudantur nisi peracta.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. They and their adherents spread abroad false rumors; as that the King should have broken promise with them concerning tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which mixture of Gods service rather then he would suffer, he would lose Children, Crown, Life, and all. Nay, they may see there is no such hope left, for that his Majesty bringeth up his Royal Issue in the true Religion and service of the Almighty.</p>
                     <p>Lastly observe the wonderful providence of God in the admirable discovery of this Superior Jesuit to be party to this Treason, and that in two respects.</p>
                     <p>First, in respect of the means of secrecy used by him in conference only with <hi>Catesby</hi> of the Laity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:52420:125"/>
Secondly, They had a strong and a deep Oath given them both for secrecy and perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, They hereupon received the holy Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, They were allowed and taught by the Jesuits, to equivocate upon Oath, salvation or otherwise, and how then should it be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered?</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, their secret intelligence was such, as that it was unpossible by the wit of man to be found out. And therefore the second thing is, how this Treason, being long sithence plotted, the providence of God did continually from time to time divert and put off the executing thereof, by unexpected putting off the times of assembly in Parliament. For the Parliament begun the <hi>19th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> in the first year of his Majesties Reign, and continued till the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, before which time the Conspirators could not be ready; from thence it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roged untill the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> against which time, they could not make the Myne ready, in respect that they could not dig there, for that the Commissioners of the Union sare near the place, and the wall was thick, and therefore they could not be provided before the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>February;</hi> and on the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> the Parliament was proroged untill the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>October.</hi> After this they found another Course, and altered the place from the Myne to the Cellar. O blessed Change of so wicked a work! Oh but these fatal Engineers are not yet discovered, and yet all things are prepared! Oh prorogue it once more: and accordingly God put it into his Majesties
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52420:125"/>
heart (having then not the least suspicion of any such matter) to prorogue the Parliament, and further to open and inlighten his understanding, out of a mystical and dark Letter, like an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of God to point to the Cellar, and command that to be searched, so that it was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered thus miraculously, but even a few hours before the Design should have been executed.</p>
                     <p>The Conclusion therefore shall be this, <hi>Qui cum Iesu itis, non itis cum Iesuitis:</hi> for <hi>they courage themselves in mischief, and commune among themselves secretly, how they may lay snares, and say, that no man shall see them. But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow, that they shall be wounded; In so much that whoso seeth it, shall say, This hath God done; for they shall perceive that it is his work.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then were repeated the proofs for every of the particular accusations aforesaid, by the express and voluntary confessions of <hi>Garnet,</hi> and of his Complices themselves, and of two credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble witnesses sworn at the Bar, and openly heard <hi>viva voce,</hi> and acknowledged by <hi>Garnet</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be men without exception.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Concerning Equivocation, whereunto he answered, that their Church condemned all lying, but especially if it be in cause of Religion and faith, that being the most pernicious lye of all others, and by</hi> St. Augustine <hi>condemned in the</hi> Priscillianists: <hi>Nay, to lie in any cause is held a fin, and evil, Howsoever of 8 degrees which St.</hi> Augustine <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, the lowest indeed is to lie for to procure the good of some without hurting of any: So then our Equivocation is not to maintain lying, but to defend the use of certain Propositions. For a man may be asked of one, who hath no Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to interrogate, or examined concerning some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which belongeth not to his cognisance who asketh, As what a man thinketh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So then no man may Equivocate, when he ought to tell the truth, Otherwise he may; And so St.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine <hi>upon</hi> John <hi>saith, That Christ denied he
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52420:126"/>
knew the day of Iudgment,</hi> viz. <hi>with purpose to tell it to his Disciples; and so St.</hi> Thomas <hi>and others, who handle this matter. Chiefly under the Title of Confession. 2. For the second point, which was the Power of the Pope in deposing of Princes, his Answer was three-fold. 1. That therein he onely propounded and followed the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Doctrine of the Church. 2. That this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Power of the Pope, was by all other Catholick Princes tolerated without grievance. 3. That yet for his own part, he always made a difference in the matter of Excommunicating and Deposing of Princes, betwixt the condition and state of our King, and of others, who having sometimes been Catholicks, did, or shall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards fall back. As for</hi> Simanca <hi>and other Writers, whatsoever they set down of the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Hereticks, it is to be understood of those Princes, who having sometimes professed the Faith of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>do afterwards make a defection from the same.</hi>

Concerning their not going to Church, whereas it was urged by Mr. Attorney, that the grounds of their not going to Church, was the Excommunication and Bull of</hi> Pius Quintus, <hi>and that now they may go, for that his Majesty is not denounced Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; I answer, That it followeth not; for the Arrians and Catholicks had the same Service in their Churches, yet came they not together. And I know divers my self, who before that Bull, refused to go to Church all the time of Queen</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth, <hi>though perhaps most Catholicks did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed</hi>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:52420:127"/>
                        <hi>go to Church, before it was about the end of the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>where this matter was discussed by twelve learned men, and concluded not lawful. And this was occasioned, for that</hi> Calvin <hi>himself held it not lawful for any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to be present, not onely at our Mass, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in perhaps they may say there is Idolatry, but not at our Even-song, being the same with theirs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Concerning the Iesuits, he saith, That if any were privy to such horrible Treasons, it was impious, especially in men of their profession: But said, That he talked with some of them about it, and that they denied it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Touching my self, The Negociation into</hi> Spain <hi>was indeed propounded unto me, and I was also acquainted with the Negociation for Money, but ever intending it should be bestowed for the relief of poor Catholicks: But when they were there, they moved for an Army; which when they afterwards acquainted me withall, I misliked it, and said, It would be much disliked at</hi> Rome. <hi>Onely I must needs confess, I did conceal it, after the example of Christ, who commands us, when our Brother offends, to reprove him, for if he do amend, we have gained him: Yet I must needs confess, that the Laws made against such concealing are very good and just, for it is not fit the safety of a Prince should depend upon any other mans Conscience. So that I am verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, if they yielded to me, it had been good. But what their intent and meaning was in desiring an Army, I knew not; and I was charged not to meddle therein, no not with the money which was to be sent for Pensions, though it was to maintain the Title of the King.</hi>

                        </note> he should do well to speak clearly of his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that point; for otherwise he must put him in remembrance, that he had confessed to the Lords, That he had offered Sacrifice to God for stay of that Plot, unless it were for the good of the Catholick Cause; and in no other fashion (said his Lordship) was this State be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to you for your Masses and Oblations.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Garnet</hi> faintly answered, <hi>He might not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close it to any, because it was matter of secret</hi>

                     <p>Then <hi>Garnet</hi> told the Lords, <hi>That he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> Greenwell <hi>to disswade</hi> Catesby, <hi>which</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Then said the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> Why did you refuse to hear <hi>Catesby</hi> tell you all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                        </note> when he would have told you, if you had been desirous to prevent it?</p>

                        <hi>Garnet</hi> replied, <hi>That after</hi> Greenwell <hi>had told him what it was which</hi> Catesby <hi>intended,</hi>

                        <hi>and that he called to mind what</hi> Catesby <hi>said to him, at his first breaking with him in general terms, his Soul was so troubled with mislike of that particular, as he was loath to hear any more of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Well then (said the Earl of <hi>Salisbury)</hi> you see his heart. And then turning to the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                        </note> he desired leave of them, that he might use some speech concerning the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the State in this great cause, from the first beginning until that hour; and so began to this effect, That although the Evidence had been so well distributed and opened by Mr. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney, as he had never heard such a mass of matter better contracted, nor made more intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible to the Jury, to whom it was not his part to speak, nor his purpose to meddle with Mr. <hi>Garnet</hi> in Divinity, or in the Doctrine of Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, in which latter he saw how he had plaid his Master-prise: yet because he had been particularly used in this service with other of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52420:131"/>
Lords Commissioners, by whom, nothing was more desired, next the glory of God, than to demonstrate to the world with that sincerity and moderation his Majesties Justice was carried in all points, he would be bold to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the manner of this Arraignment, and of the place where it was appointed. For the first, he said, That seeing there was nothing to which this State might more attribute the infinite goodness and blessings of God, than to the protection of the true Religion, which had groaned so long under the bitter persecutions of men of his profession; he confessed, that he held himself greatly honoured to be an Assistant amongst so many great Lords, at the Seat of Justice, where Gods Cause should receive so much honour, by discrediting the person of <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> on whom the common Adversary had thought to confer the usurpation of such an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Jurisdiction: For otherwise, who did not know, that the quality of poor <hi>Henry Garnet</hi> might have undergone a more ordinary form of Trial, and happily in some other place of less note and observation? And so his Lordship took an occasion to declare, That the City of <hi>London</hi> was so dear to the King, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty so desirous to give it all honour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as when this opportunity was put into his hands, whereby there might be made so visible an Anatomy of Popish Doctrine, from whence these Treasons have their source and support, he thought he could not chuse a fitter Stage than the City of <hi>London,</hi> which was not onely right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly termed, <hi>The Chamber of his Empire,</hi> but was by his Majesty esteemed as his greatest and safest
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52420:131"/>
Treasury, who accounteth no Riches compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Subjects Hearts; and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, That such a Circuit did never contain so many faithful Subjects within the Walls: a matter well appearing to his own eyes amongst others, upon the decease of the late Queen of precious memory, when he attending most of the Peers and Privy Counsellors of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who were accompanied with no small number of Noble and Faithful Gentlemen, had seen them all stayed from entry within the Gates of this City, until they had publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared with one voice, That they would live and die with the King our Sovereign Lord. To you therefore, Mr. <hi>Garnet,</hi> (said the Earl of <hi>Salisbury)</hi> must I address my self, as the man in whom it appeareth best what horrible Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have been covered under the Mantle of Religion, which heretofore had been Petty-Treason for a Protestant to have affirmed: such hath been the iniquity of false tongues, who have always sought to prove the Truth a liar: of which impudent calumnies the State is so tender, as you do best know (Mr. <hi>Garnet)</hi> that since your apprehension even till this day, you have been as Christianly, as courteously, and as carefully used, as ever man could be, of any quality, or any profession: Yea, it may truly be said, that you have been as well attended for health or otherwise, as a Nurse-child. Is it true or no, said the Earl?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is most true, my Lord</hi> (said <hi>Garnet) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess</hi>

hardiness of heart to deny all things; let it not be forgotten, that this Interlocution of yours with <hi>Hall,</hi> over-heard by others, appears to be <hi>Digitus Dei;</hi> for thereby had the Lords some light and proof of matter against you, which must have been discovered otherwise by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and coertion, a matter ordinary in other Kingdoms, though now for born here; but it is better as it is for the Honour of the State, for so were your own words, that you thought it best to tell the truth at last, when you saw you were confounded <hi>Tanta nube testium.</hi> In which I protest, that I do confidently assure my self, that you would as easily have confessed your self to be Author of all the Action, as the Concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, but that his Majesty, and my Lords, were well contented to draw all from you without Racking, or any such bitter torments. Then speaking to <hi>Garnet,</hi> he said, I pray you, Mr. <hi>Garnet,</hi> what encouraged <hi>Catesby</hi> that he might proceed, but your resolving him in the first Proposition?

                     <p>Then <hi>Garnet</hi> answered, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Catesby <hi>was to blame to make such application.</hi>

                     <p>To that the Earl replied, That he must needs be bold with him, to drive him from the <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                        </note> trust he had, to satisfie the world by his denials, by putting him in mind, how after the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locution betwixt him and <hi>Hall,</hi> when he was called before all the Lords, and was asked, not
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52420:132"/>
what he said, but whether <hi>Hall</hi> and he had conference together, desiring him not to equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate; how stifly he denied it upon his Soul, reiterating it with so many detestable execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the Earl said, it wounded their hearts to hear him; and yet as soon as <hi>Hall</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed it, he grew ashamed, crying the Lords mercy, and said, he had offended, if Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not help him.</p>
                     <p>To this <hi>Garnet</hi> answered, <hi>That when one is</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Garnet.</note> 
                        <hi>asked a question before a Magistrate, he was not bound to answer before some Witnesses he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced against him,</hi> Quia nemo tenetur prodere seipsum. <hi>Then</hi> Garnet <hi>falling into some professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his well-wishing to his Majesty, and being put in mind of the answer he had made concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Excommunication of Kings, wherein he referred himself to the Canon of</hi> Nos Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, <hi>he answered, That his Majesty was not yet Excommunicated.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> bad him deal <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                        </note> plainly, for now was the time, Whether in case the Pope, <hi>per sententiam Orthodoxam,</hi> should Excommunicate the Kings Majesty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> his Subjects were bound to continue their obedience?</p>
                     <p>To this he denied to answer, by which the hearers might see his mind.</p>
                     <p>From that matter he began to make request, that where he had confessed the receiving of two Brieves or Bulls from the Pope, in the Queens time, by which all Catholicks were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to adhere to any Successor that was not obedient to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> his Majesty would be pleased to make a favourable
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52420:133"/>
interpretation, because he had shewed them to very few Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> in the Queens time; and when he understood that the Pope had changed his mind, then he burnt the Bulls.</p>
                     <p>To that it was said, That belike the Pope changed his mind, when the King was so safely possessed of his Estate, and <hi>Garnet</hi> with his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices began to feel their own impiety; and so, as <hi>Catesby</hi> said to <hi>Percy,</hi> did resolve roundly of that Treason, which would speed all at once.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Then</hi> Garnet <hi>began to use some speeches, that he was not consenting to the Powder-treason.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Garnet.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereupon the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> said, <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                        </note> Mr. <hi>Garnet,</hi> give me but one Argument that you were not consenting to it, that can hold in any indifferent mans ear or sense, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides your bare Negative. But <hi>Garnet</hi> replied not.</p>
                     <p>Then Mr. Attorney General spake in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer <note place="margin">Mr. Attor.</note> of <hi>Garnet</hi> more particularly to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. 1. For Equivocation, it is true indeed, that they do outwardly to the world condemn lying and perjury, because the contrary were too palpable, and would make them odious to all men: But it is open and broad lying and forswearing, not secret and close lying and perjury, or swearing a falshood which is most abominable, and without defence or example. And if they allow it not generally in others, yet at least in themselves, their confederates and associates in treasonable practises, they will both warrant and defend it, especially when
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52420:133"/>
it may serve their turn, for such purposes and ends as they look after. 2. Concerning the usurped power of the Pope in deposing of Princes, neither is it the general Doctrine of the Church, as he falsly said, neither allowed or tolerated by all Princes, who are otherwise of their Religion, as may appear out of the <hi>French</hi> discourse written to the <hi>French</hi> King against the re-admitting of the Jesuitical Faction. And whereas he would pick a thank, in seeming to spare and exempt King <hi>Iames</hi> our Sovereign; it is not possible to avoid their distinction of being Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated <hi>de jure,</hi> if not <hi>de facto;</hi> howsoever if it be true also, that the Pope doth, <hi>de facto,</hi> every year once curse all Hereticks. For Recusants not going to Church, the example of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks not joyning in service and prayer with the <hi>Arrians,</hi> who denied a main Article of the Christian Creed, doth no ways hold, neither can it agree to us, of whom no such impious blasphemy can be shewed or imagined. That <hi>Garnet</hi> said, He knew some, who, before the Bull came, went not to Church, it may be true perhaps in some one or two perverted and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse men like himself: But whereas he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as if there the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had been determined, and thereupon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth, that after that all Romish Catholicks refused to meet with us at Church in time of prayer, it is a gross error; for the last Session of that Council was in the year of our Lord 1563, which was in the fifth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> whereas I shewed, and am able to justifie and prove, That their Romish
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52420:134"/>
English Catholicks came to our Service in our Churches until the nineteenth year of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, which was many years after that Council was ended.</p>
                     <p>Concerning <hi>Garnet</hi> himself: First, for that answer of his, that he knew of the Powder-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by Confession; it is true which before was spoken, that such Acts as this is, <hi>Non laudantur nisi peracta,</hi> are then onely commended when they are performed; but otherwise, first, <hi>Greenwel</hi>'s was no Sacramental Confession, for that the Confitent was not Penitent: nay, himself hath clearly delivered under his hand, That the Powder-Treason was told him, not as a fault, but by way of consultation and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. 2. It was a future thing to be done, and not already then executed. 3. <hi>Greenwel</hi> told it not of himself that he should do it, but of <hi>Fawkes, P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>y, Catesby, Winter,</hi> and others; and therefore he ought to have discovered them, for that they were no Confitents. 4. He might and ought to have discovered the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, for preservation of the State, though he had concealed the persons. 5. <hi>Catesby</hi> told it unto him <hi>extra confessionem,</hi> out of Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, saying, They might as w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ll turn him out, as have kept him out. Lastly, by the Common Law, howsoever it were (it being <hi>crimen laesae Majestatis)</hi> he ought to have disclosed it. Now for that <hi>Garnet</hi> denied, that he was a principal Author and Procurer of this Treason, but onely that he had received knowledge thereof; the contrary is clear and manifest, both out of his own Confessions, by himself acknowledged, and apparently proved, in that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52420:134"/>
he resolved <hi>Catesby</hi> concerning the lawfulness and merit thereof, and that he prayed for the good success of the Powder-Treason, which is more than either consultation or consent. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, he must remember him of the old Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicle, <hi>Qui non prohibet quod prohibere potest, consentire videtur. Garnet</hi> might have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Greenwell</hi> that told him of the Powder-Treason, to have desisted, but did not: but <hi>Greenwell</hi> went still on with the Treason, and when it was disclosed, went into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to move Rebellion, which doubtless he would never have done, if <hi>Garnet</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden him: therefore he said, he might say with the Orator <hi>Tully, Cui adsunt testimonia rerum, quid opus est verbis?</hi> Moreover Mr. Attorney added, how <hi>Garnet</hi> writ first for <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Winter,</hi> then for <hi>Kit Wright,</hi> after that for <hi>Guy Fawkes,</hi> then for Sir <hi>Edward Bainham,</hi> and afterwards for <hi>Catesby</hi> for a Regiment of Horse; and that <hi>Garnet</hi> was for the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and by his Breeves intended to keep out the King, except he should tolerate and swear to maintain the Romish Religion. Then Mr. Attorney spake of the Interlocution betwixt <hi>Garnet</hi> and <hi>Hall,</hi> and said, That in all their speeches they never named God, nor confessed their innocency; but as soon as they spake to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Hall</hi> spake first, and then <hi>Garnet</hi> said, He suspected one, whose name, they that were set to over-hear them, could not hear, to have disclosed something against them. But it may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, for he said he was much subject to that frailty of suspicion. He said, He received a Note from <hi>Rookwood,</hi> that <hi>Greenwell</hi> was gone over-Seas;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52420:135"/>
and another, that <hi>Gerard</hi> was gone to father <hi>Parsons,</hi> and that Mistress <hi>Anne</hi> was in Town (meaning Mrs. <hi>Anne Vaux)</hi> and many other things were by them uttered in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
                     <p>By this time came in Mr. <hi>Forset,</hi> who being deposed, affirmed likewise, that their examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the matter therein contained were true; saying further, that both of them took notes of that which they heard of <hi>Garnet</hi> and <hi>Hall,</hi> as near as possibly they could, and set down nothing in their examinations, but those things, wherein both their notes, and perfect memories agreed and assented, and that many things that were very material; and of great moment, were left out of their examinations, because both their notes and memories did not perfectly agree therein.</p>
                     <p>And now one of the Letters, which were written with sack, washewed to the Court, by which appeared that <hi>Hall</hi> and <hi>Garnet</hi> had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locution together. Mr. Atturney here inferred that the necessary end of Justice was, <hi>vt poena ad paucos, metus ad omnes perveniat,</hi> and urged the examination of <hi>Garnet,</hi> wherein he confessed that when <hi>Tesmond</hi> alias <hi>Greenwell,</hi> made relation to him of the great blow by the Powder-trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, who should have the protection, <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> said, the Lords that should be left alive should choose a Protector. And further Mr. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney urged the writing of another Letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with sack to <hi>Sayer,</hi> alias <hi>Rockwood,</hi> a Priest in the <hi>Gate-house;</hi> But of this point much is formerly mentioned.</p>
                     <p>Here Mr. Attorney ending, my Lord of

                        <hi>Northampt.</hi> spake to the Prisoner this speech following.</p>

                                 <p>I confess that never any man in your state gave less hold or advantage to examiners, than you have done in the whole course of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to us that were in Commission: sometime by forswearing, as upon the confession of <hi>Hall</hi>
                                    <pb n="130" facs="tcp:52420:136"/>
your fellow: sometime by dissembling, as about the places of your <hi>Rendezvous,</hi> which was the lapwings neast: sometimes by earnest expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: sometime by artificial Equivocation: sometime by Sophisticating true substances: sometime by adding false qualities: yet <hi>sat su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perest,</hi> as may appear, to the defeat of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and the defence of the Kings Majesty, <hi>quia magna est veritas, &amp; praevalet.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Your parts by nature simply considered, and in another person, would rather move compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, than exasperate humanity: for whom would not the ruine of such a person touch, as is in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance temperate, and in understanding ripe? But our end at this time is the same with <hi>Decius</hi> in <hi>Livie, ut quem vos obrutum reliquistis, ignem</hi> &amp;c. that we may quench that fire by prevention, which you have only raked up in ashes, <hi>ut no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum daret incendium,</hi> that it might cause a new combustion so soon as it might hit upon matter that were fit and sutable. Wherefore I must ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draw your answers to the true touch for discharge of rumors, than <hi>verberare aërem,</hi> beat the air: For the substance of all your eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and slie shifts, is as the Inn-keepers of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> confessed of his dishes to his guests, admiring <hi>tantam fer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                                 <p>The two Buls that in the late Queens time entred the land (with a purpose by their lowd lowing to call all their calves together, for the making of a stong party, at the shutting up of the evening against our dead Soveraign) were grased in your pastures, Mr. <hi>Garnet,</hi> or to speak
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52420:136"/>
more properly (because they durst neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the light, nor admit the air) they were staul-fed at your crib, as your self confess, and therefore, <hi>Serve nequam, ex ore tuo te judico.</hi> And what answer make you to this? mary that the purpose was imparted to very few: so much the worse: For out of publication grows discovery; and yet experience hath justified, that those ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few were the very souls and spirits of that pack of Conspirators, and such as for want of patience and temperance to tary the time, when the game had been brought to bearing, should have played the chiefest parts in the late smoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tragedy. You say the Buls were after sacrificed in the fire by your self. But not before the Kings good Angel had cut their throats, and the best part of their proof were past, and your hopes dead of that good which in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood they should have brought with them. For to what use could these dumb beasts serve in seeking to prevent that lawful and undoubted right, which heaven had now proclaimed, and earth acknowledged? But let the proof be what it will, I look into the root. I wonder Mr. <hi>Garnet,</hi> what Apostle warrants you in undertaking wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Plots, in hope that good may follow; neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what all Laws (and the Laws of <hi>England</hi> above all) what all States and Nations conclude of men, that slily practise, and combine for anticipation of the future rights of lawfull Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors.</p>
                                 <p>In excuse of Letters written with your own hand by <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> to father <hi>Creswell,</hi> when he was employed about the procurement of an Army to Invade, with supplies of Treasure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52420:137"/>
for the quicker execution of so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat an Enterprise, you answer, that the Persons were commended in your Letters, not the Plot: <hi>spectatum admissi risum teneatis amici?</hi> as though the minister had any other errand or instruction, than the main Plot it self: as though you, Mr. <hi>Garnet;</hi> being then <hi>Magister</hi> in <hi>Israel,</hi> and <hi>Rector chori,</hi> could or would be ignorant of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed end; as though so grave a Person as your self, were likely to set his hand to Blancks like a baby, and to leave the rest to the disposition of a man wholly transported with fiery humors: Or as though in this very point other mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession in particular, beside your own in genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, had not left us marks and traces evident and plain enough to descry doubleness with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity. You confess privity to a practice, but not for an Army: foreknowledge of a course for getting Treasure, but with a purpose, as you conceived, to employ it wholly for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Catholicks. So as the reason of the reservedness of <hi>Catesby, Winter</hi> and the rest toward you, must be undoubtedly their suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of your over great affection and duty to the Queen; For otherwise it is certain they would have trusted you as well with their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as with their means: with their hopes, as with their instruments: especially considering how hard it was for them to compass their own vast desires, without help both of your credit, and of your industry.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Wright</hi> was in like manner, and with like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition commended by you afterward for the quickening of <hi>Winters</hi> project, if any life were in it, upon the slacking of the passions of <hi>Spain,</hi>
                                    <pb n="133" facs="tcp:52420:137"/>
with the propositions of peace, that no time might be lost, no stone left unremoved, that might give a knock to the peace of our policy: your head wrought upon all offers, your hand walked in all Regions, your spirit steered all attempts and undertakings: and yet if protestations, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified and protected by Equivocations, may cary weight; all this while your mind was, as good pastors to be, patient, your thoughts were obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and your counsels innocent. But now to search your cunning somewhat nearer to the quick, we must observe, that when your hopes of Invasion began to cool by likelyhood of peace, your desires of supplies by the cold an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers that came from <hi>Spain,</hi> your expectation of new mischief to be wrought at home without Complots abroad: when malice it self was cast into so desperate a swoun, as neither <hi>Rosa solis</hi> when <hi>Spain</hi> relented, nor <hi>Iscobah</hi> when <hi>Tyrone</hi> submitted, nor dissention within the Kingdom when discontentments ended, could put it by any fresh adventure into life, when you for your own part, Mr. <hi>Garnet,</hi> having bin once washed and regenerated in the fountain of the Kings free Pardon, from the leprous spots of former Treasons, were determined to begin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another stock, and return as a dog to the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit (though washing can avail no man (as the Preacher warns) that <hi>iterum tangit mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum,</hi> toucheth the dead the second or third time after he hath been made clean:) for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly <hi>Catesby</hi> resorts to you, as <hi>Mahomet</hi> might to <hi>Sergius,</hi> (for now I speak according to the matter, and not the men) to enquire whether it were lawful, considering the necessiity of the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52420:138"/>
time, to undertake an enterprise, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the Catholick Religion, though it were likely that among many that were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, some should perish that were innocent. A man that is Religious in any kind, or but morally honest in his own kind, would expect that a Priest, a <hi>Iesuit,</hi> (which title doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply salvation, and not destruction, nay, the Superior of English <hi>Iesuits)</hi> upon this rash demand, should have resorted for a safe resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Gods own Book, where he should have found, that God was pleased to withdraw his wrathful hand from <hi>Sodom,</hi> so as there had been only <hi>decem justi,</hi> ten justmen within that Town, and for their sakes; that the wise housholder in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> marking how hard it would be, when the corn was ripe, to make se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, gave order to his servants to abstain from plucking up the tares, <hi>ne simul eradica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent triticum,</hi> least withall they plucked up the wheat by the Roots. Ye should have found in the stories of the Church, that the godly Bishops in the first spring of Religion, suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed process against the <hi>Priscillian</hi> Hereticks, <hi>ne Catholici cum illis perirent,</hi> least the Catholicks might also perish with them. And the Church of <hi>Millain</hi> taxed <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperor, <hi>quod insontes unâ cum sontibus trucidâsset,</hi> that he had proceeded both against the guilty, and the guiltless with one stroke, and with one measure of severity. But far beside the Holy writ, or holy presedents, your answer, Mr. <hi>Garnet,</hi> was such, as I both abhor to think, and quake to utter, that if any great advantage were to grow to the Church this way, they might destroy them all.</p>

And <hi>Catesby</hi> doubting of the fickleness of mens affections, in cases that concern the soul, used your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance as a charm or spell, to keep quick spirits within the circle of combined faith, which otherwise perhaps when Hell brake loose, would have sought liberty. Your Charter only (whereupon I beseech you for your own souls health, to meditate for the time you tarry in this world) was the Base whereon some grounded their bad conscience in proceeding with this Plot, not only to the destruction of their bodies, but to the perill of their souls, without sound and true repentance, which by the merit of Christs passion, will serve in <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque hora peccator ingemuerit.</hi> For though Christ were joyfull that he had not lost one of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52420:139"/>
those whom his father gave him in charge, and came to save, and not to destroy; yet your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise was to destroy them all: Such was your burning charity.</p>

For the Powder-plot which in <hi>Ianu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> was barly <hi>embryo,</hi> became <hi>formatus foetus</hi> in the <hi>March</hi> next following, it quickened the next <hi>December,</hi> when the Pioneers began to dig in the thick wall: <hi>Catesby</hi> not long after impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his conceipt secretly to you, of the great likelihood he foresaw of a lucky time of birth, and thereupon was <hi>Guy Fawks</hi> sent over by your knowledge and encouragement, to deal with Sir <hi>William Stanley,</hi> about the drawing down of Forces somewhat nearer to the Sea side for speedy transport, which if need were, might carry torches at the solemnity. But what is your answer to this employment of <hi>Guy Fawks?</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth that your purpsoe was only, to commend him as a Souldier, but not as a Conspirator. O unlucky Treason, that comes to be excused by so poor an Advocate! when <hi>Fawks</hi> himself meant nothing else than to be a Souldier, having
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52420:139"/>
so strange a part to play soon after in the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-train, but used this retreat as a colour to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise the secret purpose that did onely tarry time, and to eschew those watchful eyes, that nearer hand would have observed both his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and his outlets in that place more narrowly. The point is clear, the confessions are direct, the purpose is palpable. All the lines of your level are drawn to the centre of the Powder-mine. All Letters are either drawn or enterlined <hi>manu Scorpionis,</hi> to use the word of <hi>Hierome;</hi> and yet under pain of censure we must believe, that all this while you were in charity, because all this while (which it grieves me to remember) you were not afraid to communicate.</p>
                                 <p>But now to weigh your Answers that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Powder-plot it self, which is <hi>paramount</hi> in respect of the Longitude and Latitude to all that have been, or shall ever be: Your self can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, Mr. <hi>Garnet,</hi> that <hi>Green-wel</hi>'s over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as you say in Confession, coming after the notice which you took of <hi>Catesbies</hi> question about Innocents, was but a fruit of your own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, an effect of your own instruction, and a conclusion drawn wholly out of your own propositions and principles. Now when we press to know what reason drew you to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment of a Project so pernicious both to Prince and State, without revealing it either to the King himself, <hi>tanquam praecellenti,</hi> to use St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s term, or to his Ministers subordinate; you start to the shift of Confession for a formal help, which comes too short in respect of <hi>Cates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>'s first discovery, which your own words aver plainly to have wrought with you. I will not
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52420:140"/>
argue in this place what course a Confessor should take, or how far he ought to strain for the securing of a Princes life, that otherwise is sure to perish by the rage and ignorance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible of a base Villain, (whose life answers not in value the least hair of a Princes head) because time suffers not: But I am sure, that for a matter of less weight than this, and a crime of less importance than the life both of Prince and State, Confession received a deep wound for a long time, more than a thousand years past, in the Church of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> For God forbid that matters of such weight should hang by such feeble threeds. But to this excuse of tenderness in the point of Confession, I would answer by making a great doubt, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this course of conference were a Confession or not: for against your bare words, which Equivocation supports, I object some likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, That since you kneeled sometimes, and sometimes walked up and down; since matter of conspiracy were interlaced with matter of Confession, not for ease of conscience, as should appear, but for advice in execution; since <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> was absolved instantly, which excludes the shift of reference; and <hi>Greenwel</hi> should be found to lie to the holy Ghost, in case this were a true Confession, in promising (Mr. <hi>Garnet)</hi> as you say, to disswade the project, which he prosecuted even to the last point, as is evident: and after the Powder Camp brake up, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that though this discovery were by confession, yet it was no <hi>Supersedeas</hi> to your former knowledge from <hi>Catesby,</hi> your trusty friend: and if it were none, then it can be no
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52420:140"/>
protection for faith putrified. What need we seek light through cobweb-lawns, when the drift of your whole device in seeking to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from one what you learned of another, and from all what you affected and abetted in your heart, doth evidently prove your counsels to have been carried along with such a temper of reservedness, as whensoever mischief should be brought to light, the world might rather wonder at your caution, than commend your fidelity.</p>
                                 <p>By shaping such weak answers to demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions so manifest, you must either work by the Ring of <hi>Giges,</hi> in making your audacity and presumption invisible; or hold a very weak conceit of our capacities, in supposing that they can be either dazled or deluded by such poor Sophistry. For though you pretend to have received a deep wound in Conscience at the first revealing of the plot, to have lost your sleep with vexation of spirit, to have offered and prayed to God for his preventing grace, to have required <hi>Greenwel</hi>'s help and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in crossing and diverting the design; yet all this while you suffered the project to proceed, you helped and assisted their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours that were labourers, you wrote earnestly Letters both to <hi>Baldwin</hi> and to <hi>Creswel</hi> for their furtherance of ordinary means, you gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for a prayer to be said by Catholicks for their prosperous success, you kept measure with the two first dimensions of Frier <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Brasen Head, <hi>Time is, Time was,</hi> till (thanks be to God) the <hi>third time was past;</hi> you had ever an ear open to listen for the crack, and were in the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52420:141"/>
same agony for the Powder-plot, that <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth was for the Popes duress, giving or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in all his Dominions, that Prayers should be made for his release, when in the mean time he kept and held him in his own hand prisoner: the least word of your mouth, or labour of your pen, might have secured both Prince and State; while you pretend to have broken both your sleeps and your brains, and that with a greater advantage to the cause which you would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, than can ever grow by combustion and conspiracy. But your tenderness herein was suitable with another dutiful desire of yours to disswade <hi>Catesby</hi> from the Plot, at his coming into <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> who never meant to come thither, but as to the Rendezvous when the Parliament had been blown up, and the storm had been blown over. It may be that your mind was perplexed and disquieted upon the meditation of strange events, for so was the mind of <hi>Cain, Achitophel,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd his Master: the reason is very pregnant in the Word of God it self, that <hi>cum sit timidia nequitia, dat testimonium condemnationis,</hi> since wickedness is cowardly and timorous, it gives evidence of condemnation against it self: <hi>Et semper praesumit saeva perturbata conscientia;</hi> but Sathan prevailing, his Angels execute.</p>
                                 <p>I will now conclude this address to you, Mr. <hi>Garnet,</hi> by observing some special points, how strangely and preposterously the Devil, in this last project of Powder, hath altered his old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. For the curse that God laid upon the Serpent, after the first transgression, was, <hi>Ut gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diretur super pectus suum,</hi> to creep upon his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:52420:141"/>
breast; but now we find him mounted upon the wings of an <hi>Espray,</hi> to the highest Region of the Air, and among the Fire-works. The other part of his curse was, that he should eat <hi>Pulverem,</hi> that is, dust or powder: But now since <hi>Sodom</hi> was destroyed by <hi>Sulphure,</hi> and the Wife of <hi>Lot</hi> transmuted into Salt, the proper materials of that mean by which Satan wrought in this hot fire, it appears that the Serpent from eating powder (which was a plain devise) fell, for a worse purpose, to snuff Gun-powder. Then the Serpent did <hi>insidiari calcaneo,</hi> now <hi>capiti,</hi> from which the body draweth both sense sense and influence. Then he began to <hi>Eve</hi> with a modest question, <hi>Cur praecepit Deus,</hi> Why hath God commanded? now with a resolution, <hi>Praecepit Deus,</hi> God hath commanded. His words in those carried a flourish of great comfort, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaquam moriemini;</hi> but now terror, <hi>Moriemini,</hi> for a great advantage destroy them all. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil at that time did onely nibble about the Text of holy Writ, <hi>tanquam mus ponticus,</hi> as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> terms <hi>Martian;</hi> but now he draws the grounds of Equivocation concerning Princes lives: Out of the very Scripture, and by Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastical Authority, Sathan tempted Christ with a fair offer, <hi>Dandi omnia,</hi> of giving all upon the top of the Pinacle: But now he sets upon the great Lieutenant of Gods Authority and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, with an <hi>auferam tibi omnia,</hi> both Life and Crown, <hi>ex penetralibus ubi Christus non est,</hi> as we are taught by his Evangelist. The Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons ambition extended no further, than the sweeping away with his tail of the third part of the Stars in the Firmament: But now the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52420:142"/>
plot of him and his Disciples was, to sweep away the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars, both out of Star-Chamber and Parliament, that no light be given in this Kingdom to the best Labourers. In the time of <hi>Saul,</hi> the Devil was so modest as to suspend his Illusions and Oracles, till the Visions of the Prophets began to cease: But now though we have both <hi>Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>&amp; firmiorem sermonem propheticum,</hi> yet he ruffles among the robes, <hi>&amp; inaudita fundit oracula.</hi> In the beginning of the Christian Church, the very name of Christ was sufficient to make Sathan pack, and to quit the possession of tormented men; but he hath learned a more cunning trick of late, under the banner of Christ, to fight against the Lieutenants of his Imperial Majesty. In one point I find no change, that is, in labouring and working by all means, to draw men from their trust in Gods direction, to a tickle kind of confidence in themselves, and their own weak knowledge of good and ill. And as that error was the cause of <hi>Adams</hi> exile from Paradise, which was <hi>hortus conclusus;</hi> so had such another almost divided us and our heirs both from our lives and Estates, <hi>Et penitus toto divisos orbe Britannos.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>I have stood the longer on this point, to let you know how idlely, and yet how wilfully you strive against both the Providence of God, and the Justice of the Land; <hi>Quae tuo te jugulavit gladio.</hi> The more you labour to get out of the Wood, having once lost the right way, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you creep in. For the wisdom of the world is folly before God; and unpossible it is, that those counsels or proceedings should either
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52420:142"/>
have good proof in this world, or reward in the next, that are embrued with blood, and pursued with tyranny. If then there be no other way to Heaven than by the destruction of Gods An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed and their Heirs, I will conclude with you, Mr. <hi>Garnet,</hi> as <hi>Constantius</hi> did with <hi>Asce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, Erigito tibi scalam, &amp; in coelum solus ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dito;</hi> set up a Ladder for your self, and climb up to Heaven alone, for Loyal minds will not sute themselves with such bad company. The worst I wish to your person standing now to be convicted at the Bar, is remorse and repentance, for the safeguard of your Soul; and for the rest, <hi>Fiat justitia, currat lex, &amp; vincat Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas.</hi>

                        <hi>than he could excuse, and he had dealt plainly with them; but he was bound to keep the secrets of Confessions, and to disclose nothing that he heard in Sacramental Confession.</hi>

                     <p>Whereupon the Earl of <hi>Nottingham</hi> asked him, if one confessed this day to him, that to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Notting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     </p>
                     <p>Then the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> desired liberty of him to ask him some questions of the nature of <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>

                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Yes,</hi> (said <hi>Garnet.)</hi>

Then he demanded, Whether <hi>Greenwel</hi> were <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                        </note> absolved by him or no?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Garnet</hi> said, <hi>He was.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Garnet.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Earl then asked him, What <hi>Greenwel</hi> had done, to shew that he was sorry for it, and <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                        </note> whether he did promise to desist?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Garnet</hi> answered, <hi>that</hi> Greenwel <hi>said, He would do his best.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Garnet.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>To that the Earl replied, That it could not be so; for as soon as <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Percy</hi> were <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                        </note> in Arms, <hi>Greenwel</hi> came to them from <hi>Garnet,</hi> and so went from them to <hi>Hall</hi> at Mr. <hi>Abington</hi>'s house, inviting them most earnestly to come and assist those Gentlemen in that action. Hereby (saith he) it appears, that either <hi>Greenwel</hi> told you out of Confession, and then there needs no secrecie; or if it were in Confession, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed no penitency, and therefore you could not absolve him. To which the Earl added, That this one circumstance must still be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and cannot be cleared, That when <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> told you what <hi>Catesby</hi> meant in particular, and you then called to mind also what <hi>Catesby</hi> had spoken to you in the general before, if you had not been so desirous to have the Plot take effect, you might have disclosed it out of your general knowledge from <hi>Catesby:</hi> but when <hi>Catesby</hi> offered to deliver you the particulars himself, as he had done to <hi>Greenwel,</hi> you refused to hear him, lest your tongue should have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed your heart.</p>
                     <p>To this <hi>Garnet</hi> weakly replied, <hi>That he did what he could to disswade it, and went into</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Garnet.</note> Warwickshire <hi>with a purpose to disswade Mr.</hi> Catesby, <hi>when he should have come down. And

for Mr.</hi> Greenwel'<hi>s going to Father</hi> Hall, <hi>to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him to joyn,</hi> Garnet <hi>said, he did very ill in so doing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To that the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> replied, That <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                        </note> his first answer was most absurd, seeing he knew <hi>Catesby</hi> would not come down till the <hi>6th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> which was the day after the blow should have been given; and <hi>Garnet</hi> went into the Countrey ten days before. And for the second, he said, That he was onely glad, that the world might now see, that Jesuits were condemned by Jesuits; and Treason and Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors laid naked by the Traitors themselves; yea, Jesuits by that Jesuit, that governs all Jesuits here, and without whom, no Jesuit in <hi>England</hi> can do any thing.</p>
                     <p>Garnet <hi>(as it should seem) being here mightily touched with remorse of his offence, prayed God</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Garnet.</note> 
                        <hi>and the King, that other Catholicks might not fare the worse for his sake.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> said, Mr. <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                        </note> is it not a lamentable thing, that if the Pope, or <hi>Claudius Aquaviva,</hi> or your self, command poor Catholicks any thing, that they must obey you, though it be to endanger both body and soul? And if you maintain such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine amongst you, how can the King be safe? Is it not time therefore the King and the State should look to you, that spend your time thus in his Kingdom?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Garnet</hi> said very passionately, <hi>My Lord, I would to God I had never known of the Powder-Treason.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Garnet.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hereupon the Lord Chief Justice of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> said, <hi>Garnet,</hi> you are Superior of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits; <note place="margin">Lord Chief Just.</note>
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:52420:144"/>
and if you forbid, must not the rest obey? Was not <hi>Greenwel</hi> with you half an hour at Sir <hi>Everard Digby</hi>'s house, when you heard of the discovery of your Treason? and did you not there confer and debate the matter toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Did you not send him to <hi>Hall,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Abington</hi>'s house, to stir him up to go to the Rebels, and encourage them? Yet you seek to colour all this, but that's but a meer shift in you; and notwithstanding all this you said, No man living but one did know that you were privy to it; then belike some that are dead did know it. <hi>Catesby</hi> was never from you, (as the Gentlewoman that kept your house with you confessed) and by many apparent proofs, and evident presumptions, you were in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of this action, and directed and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Actors; nay, I think verily, you were the chief that moved it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Garnet</hi> said, <hi>No, my Lord, I did not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then it was exceedingly well urged by my <note place="margin">Garnet.</note> Lord Chief Justice, how he writ his Letters for <hi>Winter, Wright, Fawkes, Baynham,</hi> and <hi>Cates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> principal Actors in this matchless Treason. Besides, his Lordship told him of his keeping the two Bulls to prejudice the King, and to do other mischief in the Realm; which, when he saw the King peaceably to come in, then being out of hope to do any good, he burnt them.</p>
                     <p>Here Mr. Attorney caused to be read the Confession of <hi>Hall, alias Oldcorn</hi> the Jesuit, under his own hand, (which, he said, was <hi>Omni exceptione majus)</hi> against him, wherein he confessed, That <hi>Humfrey Littleton</hi> told him, That <hi>Catesby</hi> and others were sore hurt with
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52420:144"/>
Powder, and said that he was exceeding sory that things took no better effect; whereat <hi>Hall</hi> wished him not to be discouraged, nor to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the cause by the event: For though the xi. Tribes of Israel went twice by the special com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God against the Tribe of Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, yet they both times received the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw. So <hi>Lewis</hi> the French king in his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age into the Holy-land against the Infidels, was overthrown, and his whole Army discomfitted, though his cause were good. And so likewise the Christians when they defended <hi>Rhodes</hi> against the Turks, lost the City, and the Turks had the upper hand. And this he confessed, and applied to the fact of <hi>Catesby</hi> and others for the Powder-treason, and said, It would have been commendable when it had been done, though not before.</p>
                     <p>After this Mr. Attorney opened, how <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Tresham,</hi> a dilinquent Romanist, even in <hi>articulo mortis</hi> (a fearful thing) took it upon his salvation, That he had not seen <hi>Garnet</hi> in sixteen years before, when <hi>Garnet</hi> himself had confessed he had seen him often within that time: and likewise, that <hi>Garnet</hi> knew not of the Spanish Invasion, which <hi>Garnet</hi> himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed also, and which two things <hi>Tresham</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had formerly confessed to the Lords; yet for a recantation of these two things upon his death bed, he commanded <hi>Vavasor</hi> his man, (whom I think (said Mr. Attorney) deeply guilty in this Treason) to write a Letter to the Earl of <hi>Salisbury:</hi> And to shew this his desperate recantation, Mr. <hi>Treshams</hi> Letter was offered to be read.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="148" facs="tcp:52420:145"/>
But before the reading thereof, my Lord of <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Salisbury</hi> said, Because there was matter incident to him, and to that which should be read, he thought fit to say something. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he said his desire was, truly to lay open what cause there was for any faith to be given to these mens protestations, when they, to colour their own impieties, and to slander the Kings Justice, would go about to excuse all Jesuits, how foul soever, out of an opinion that it is meritorious so to do, at such time as they had no hope of themselves. Such is it to be doubted that Sir <hi>Everard Digbies</hi> protestations might be at the Bar, who sought to clear all Jesuits of those practices, which they themselves have now confessed <hi>ex ore proprio.</hi> That such was also <hi>Treshams</hi> labour, who being visited with sickness, and his wife in charity suffered to come to him, this Letter was hatched by them, and signed by himself some few hours before his death, wherein he taketh that upon his salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which shall now by <hi>Garnet</hi> be disproved.</p>
                     <p>Then the Letter was read, being to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, That whereas since the Kings time he had had his pardon, and that to satisfie the Lords who heretofore examined him, he had accused <hi>Garnet;</hi> that now, he being weak, desired that his former examinations might be called in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were not true: and set down upon his salvation, that he had not seen <hi>Garnet</hi> in sixteen years before.</p>
                     <p>Then my Lord of <hi>Salisbury</hi> shewed and said, <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                        </note> It was a lamentable thing: for within three hours after he had done this, he died; and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52420:145"/>
                        <hi>Garnet</hi> what interpretation he made of this testamental protestation?</p>
                     <p>Garnet <hi>answered, It may be, my Lord, he</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Garnet.</note> 
                        <hi>meant to Equivocate. Here was the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and confession of Mrs.</hi> Anne Vaux <hi>offered to be read also, to confirm</hi> Treshams <hi>perjury, who confessed that she had seen Mr.</hi> Tresham <hi>with</hi> Garnet <hi>at her house, three or four times since the Kings coming in, and divers times before; and that he had dined with him, and that</hi> Garnet <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways gave him good counsel, and would say sometimes to him, and others, Good Gentlemen, be quiet: for we must obtain that which you desire by prayer. She confessed also, that they were at</hi> Erith <hi>together the last Sommer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>After all this,</hi> Garnet <hi>being demanded, if these examinations were true, he affirmed they were. And then were his own examinations likewise read to the same effect, wherein he both confessed the seeing of Mr.</hi> Tresham, <hi>and his sending into</hi> Spain <hi>about an Invasion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here my Lord of <hi>Salisbury</hi> concluded, That <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                        </note> that which was said of Mr. <hi>Tresham,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, was not done against charity to the dead, but upon inevitable necessity, to avoid all their slanderous reports and practises: for he said, That even now there was currant through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Town, a report of a Retractation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Bates</hi> his hand, of his accusation of <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel;</hi> which are strange and grievous practises to think upon. But this day shall witness to the world, that all is false, and your self condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not by any but by your self, your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions and actions. Alass, Mr. <hi>Garnet,</hi> why should we be troubled all this day with you, poor
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52420:146"/>
man, were it not to make the cause appear as it deserveth? wherein, God send you may be such an example, as you may be the last Actor in this kind.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon my Lord Admiral said to <hi>Garnet,</hi> that he had done more good this day in that Pulpit which he stood in (for it was made like unto a Pulpit wherein he stood) than he had done all the days of his life time in any other Pulpit.</p>
                     <p>Then was another examination of Mrs. <hi>Anne Vaux</hi> read, wherein she confessed that Mr. <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> and she were not long since with Mr. <hi>Tresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> at his house in <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> and stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there.</p>
                     <p>After this, my Lord of <hi>Salisbury</hi> said, Mr. <hi>Garnet,</hi> if you have not yet done, I would have <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                        </note> you to understand that the King hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that whatsoever made for you, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, all should be read, and so it is, and we take of you what you will. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman that seems to speak for you in her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, I think would sacrifice her self for you to do you good, and you likewise for her: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, good Mr. <hi>Garnet,</hi> whatsoever you have to say, say on a Gods name, and you shall be heard.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Then</hi> Garnet <hi>desired the Iury, that they would allow of, and believe those things he had denied,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Garnet.</note> 
                        <hi>and affirmed, and not to give credit unto those things, whereof there was no direct proof against him, not to condemn him by circumstances or presumptions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> demanded of him, saying, Mr. <hi>Garnet,</hi> is this all you have to say? <note place="margin">

if it be not, take your time, no man shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To whom</hi> Garnet <hi>answered, Yea, my Lord.</hi>

                     <p>Mr. Attorney humbly desired all the Lords Commissioners, that if he had forgotten to speak of any thing material, that their Lordships would be pleased to put him in mind of it: Who was assured by my Lord of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> that he had done very well, painfully, and learnedly.</p>
                     <p>Then Mr. Attorney desired the Jury might go together, who upon his motion going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether forth of the Court, within less than a quarter of an hour returned, and found <hi>Henry Garnet</hi> guilty.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon Mr. Sergeant <hi>Crook</hi> prayed <note place="margin">Serjeant <hi>Crook.</hi>
                        </note> judgment.</p>
                     <p>Then Mr. <hi>Waterhouse</hi> the Clerk of the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house.</note> Crown demanding what he could say for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, why judgment should not be given against him?</p>
                     <p>Garnet <hi>made answer, that he could say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Garnet.</note> 
                        <hi>but referred himself to the mercy of the King, and God Almighty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this, the Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi> made a Learned Speech, which in it self was very copious; and the intention being to contract this Volume as much as might be, and to keep onely to matter of Fact, it was thought conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to omit the same.</p>
                     <p>Then the Lord Chief Justice making a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy preamble of all the apparent proofs and <note place="margin">Lord Chief Justice.</note> presumptions of his guiltiness, gave Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he should be drawn, hanged, and quartered.</p>

                     <head>A true Relation of all such things as passed at the Execution of Mr. <hi>Garnet,</hi> the Third of <hi>May, Anno</hi> 1606.</head>
                     <p>ON the Third of <hi>May, Garnet,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Judgment, was executed upon a Scaffold, set up for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, at the West end of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Church. At his arise up the Scaffold, he stood much amazed, (fear and guiltiness appearing in his face.) The Deans of <hi>Pauls</hi> and <hi>Winchester</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing present, very gravely and Christianly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted him to a true and lively faith to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, a free and plain acknowledgment to the World of his offence; and if any further Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son lay in his knowledge, to unburthen his Conscience, and shew a sorrow and detestation of it. But <hi>Garnet</hi> impatient of perswasions, and ill pleased to be exhorted by them, desired them not to trouble him; he came prepared, and was resolved. Then the Recorder of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
                        <pb n="153" facs="tcp:52420:147"/>
(who was by his Majesty appointed to be there) asked <hi>Garnet</hi> if he had any thing to say unto the people before he died; it was no time to dissemble, and now his Treasons were too manifest to be dissembled: therefore if he would, the world should witness, what at last he censured of himself, and of his fact; it should be free to him to speak what he listed. But <hi>Garnet</hi> unwilling to take the offer, said, His voice was low, his strength gone, the people could not hear him, though he spake to them; but to those about him on the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, he said, The intention was wicked, and the fact would have been cruel, and from his Soul he should have abhorred it, had it effected. But he said, He onely had a general knowledge of it by Mr. <hi>Catesby,</hi> which in that he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed not, nor used means to prevent it, herein he had offended; what he knew in particulars was in Confession, as he said. But the Recorder wished him to be remembred, That the Kings Majesty had under his hand-writing these four points amongst others:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>Greenway</hi> told him of this, not as a fault, but as a thing which he had intelligence of, and told it him by way of consultation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Greenway</hi> came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to him to be resolved.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That Mr. <hi>Tesmond</hi> and he had conference of the particulars of the Powder-Treason in <hi>Essex</hi> long after.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Greenway</hi> had asked him, who should be the Protector? But <hi>Garnet</hi> said, That was to be referred till the blow was past.</p>
                     <p>These prove your privity besides Confession,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52420:148"/>
and these are extant under your hand. <hi>Garnet</hi> answered, Whatsoever was under his hand was true. And for that he disclosed not to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty the things he knew, he confessed himself justly condemned, and for this did ask forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Majesty. Hereupon the Recorder led him to the Scaffold to make his Confession publick.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Garnet</hi> said, Good Countrey-men, I am come hither this blessed day of <hi>The Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Cross,</hi> to end all my crosses in this life: The cause of my suffering is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to you; I confess I have offended the King, and am sorry for it, so far as I was guilty, which was in concealing it, and for that I ask pardon of his Majesty. The Treason intended against the King and State was bloody, my self should have detested it had it taken effect; and I am heartily sorry, that any Catholicks ever had so cruel a design. Then turning himself from the people to them about him, he made an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for Mrs. <hi>Ann Vaux,</hi> saying, There is such an honourable Gentlewoman, who hath been much wronged in report; for it is suspected and said, that I should be married to her, or worse; but I protest the contrary, she is a vertuous Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, and for me a perfect pure Virgin. For the Popes Breeves, Sir <hi>Edmond Baynams</hi> going over Seas, and the matter of the Powder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treason, he referred himself to his Arraignment, and his Confessions; for whatsoever is under my hand in any of my Confessions, said he, is true.</p>
                     <p>Then addressing himself to Execution, he kneeled at the Ladder foot, and asked if he
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52420:148"/>
might have time to pray, and how long? It was answered, he should limit himself, none should interrupt him. It appeared, he could not constantly or devoutly pray, fear of death, or hope of pardon, even then so distracted him; for oft in those Prayers he would break off, turn and look about him, and answer to what he over-heard, while he seemed to be praying. When he stood up, the Recorder finding in his behaviour as it were an expectation of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, wished him not to deceive himself, nor beguile his own Soul; he was come to die, and must die; requiring him not to equivocate with his last breath, if he knew any thing that might be danger to the King or State, he should now utter it. <hi>Garnet</hi> said, It is now no time to equivocate; how it was lawful, and when, he had shewed his mind else-where. But, saith he, I do not now equivocate, and more than I have confessed, I do not know. At his ascending up the Ladder, he desired to have warning before he was turned off. But it was told him, He must look for no other turn but death. Being upon the Gibbet, he used these words, I commend me to all good Catholicks, and I pray God preserve his Majesty, the Queen, and all their Posterity, and my Lords of the Privy Council, to whom I remember my humble duty, and I am sorry that I did dissemble with them; but I did not think they had had such proof against me, till it was shewed me: but when that was proved, I held it more honour for me at that time to confess, than before to have accused.

him more faulty than he is. I should not have charged him, but that I thought he had been safe. I pray God the Catholicks may not fare the worse for my sake; and I exhort them all to take heed they enter not into any Treasons, Rebellions, or Insurrections against the King. And with this, ended speaking, and fell to praying: and crossing himself, said, <hi>In nomine Patris, &amp; Filii, &amp; Spiritus sancti;</hi> and prayed, <hi>Maria mater Gratiae, Maria mater misericordiae, T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Here and when the <hi>Originals</hi> of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Papers</hi> or <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of Sir <hi>Everard Digby</hi> were found, will appear by the <hi>Certificate</hi> at the end of this <hi>Preface.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is thought fit to publish them all just as they were found, though all of them do not concern the Plot; that it may not be pretended, that any thing tending either to his Vindication or Honour is omitted or suppress'd. His <hi>Letter</hi> to his <hi>Sons</hi> is full of good counsel, proper for a dying Father: And the <hi>Verses,</hi> though they be not excellent, yet have a good tincture of Piety and Devotion in them.</p>
                  <p>The rest seem most of them to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with juice of Limons, or some such
<pb facs="tcp:52420:151"/>
thing, and are not made up and directed in the form of Letters, but several of them written in small pieces of Paper, that so they might the more easily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed away without suspicion, by those who were permitted to come to him.</p>
                  <p>Where any words are worn out, or so decayed, that they could not be read, there is a space left: Where any Letters or Words were doubtfull and obscure, the Transcriber hath conjectured as well as he could, and Printed them in a different Character.</p>
                  <p>This unfortunate Gentleman, Sir <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard Digby,</hi> who from a mistaken Zeal, was engaged in this horrible Conspiracy, was not, as I have been credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, above 24 years of age, at the time of his death.</p>
                  <p>As for the Papers themselves, whoever shall diligently peruse them, may receive abundant satisfaction in these following particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That this Gentleman was verily perswaded of the lawfalness of this Design, and did engage in it out of a sincere, but ignorant zeal, for the advancement, as he thought, of the true Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That although, after his Imprisonment, when he heard it was cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
<pb facs="tcp:52420:151"/>
by those of his Religion as a great sin, he call'd in question the lawfulness of it, yet he was never fully convinced that it was so great a sin.</p>
                  <p>He says indeed, That the censure of <note n="*" place="margin">Paper 1.</note> this Action by some of his Religion, <hi>call'd his Conscience in doubt of it;</hi> but withall, that <hi>this doubt which he had</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>of his good estate proceeded onely from the censure of others;</hi> and that <hi>for</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>some good space he could do nothing, but with tears ask pardon at Gods hands for all his errours, both in actions and intentions, in this business, and in his whole life; which the censure of this, contrary to his expectance, had caused him to doubt.</hi> So that here was no clear conviction of the heinousness of this horrible crime; onely if it were a sin, which, from the opinion of others concerning it, he had some doubt it might be, he asks forgiveness of God for it among the other errors of his life: But had he been fully convinc'd, he would not onely have declared his repentance for it after another manner, but have made a full discovery of this wicked Plot, and of those that were engaged in it, which it is plain from these <hi>Letters,</hi> he declin'd to to do to the last: And surely that cruel
<pb facs="tcp:52420:152"/>
expression, upon supposition that the Plot had taken effect, <hi>I do not think there</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Paper 9.</note> 
                     <hi>would have been three worth the sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that should have been lost,</hi> is but a very ill sign of his repentance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it is very probable, that afterwards, before his death, he received satisfaction of the lawfulness of it, and that from his Brother, or one whom he calls so, as may appear by these passages: <hi>I give</hi> (saith he) <hi>my Brother</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Paper 4.</note> 
                     <hi>many thanks for his sweet comforts, and assure him, that now I desire death; for the more I think of Gods mercy, the more I hope in my own case, though others have censured our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions otherwise than we understood them to be: And though the Act be thought so wicked by those of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet I hope my understanding it otherwise, with my sorrow for my error, will find acceptance at God's hands.</hi> And towards the end of that <hi>Letter,</hi> he seems to be yet much better satisfi'd, when he says, that <hi>he onely</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>owed 200l. which he had kept in his hands for the good of the BEST CAUSE.</hi> Which plainly shews what opinion he had of it himself, though out of regard to the opinion of others he begg'd Gods
<pb facs="tcp:52420:152"/>
mercy if it were an error: And in the conclusion of the next <hi>Letter</hi> (which must be written afterwards, because he says, that then <hi>he had not been ask'd the</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Paper 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Priests name,</hi> concerning which, he had desir'd his Brothers advice in the former Letter) he <hi>intreats</hi> his friends <hi>to pray</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>for his not sufficient striving against Temptations, since this business was undertook.</hi> Where by <hi>Temptations</hi> he doth in all probability mean, the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings he had entertain'd about it. But that which is more then all this, is, that in his long <hi>Letter</hi> to his Sons, though he do earnestly recommend his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to them, yet he gives them not one word of caution against such Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises and Conspiracies upon account of Religion, as that for which he was to suffer: Which it cannot be imagined he would have omitted to do, had he been throughly convinced of the impiety of such Practises.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That he thought it lawful to deny anything upon his Examination, that was to the disadvantage of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or might bring others into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, without any regard to truth: which is a strange liberty for a conscientious man to take, or to think Religion doth
<pb facs="tcp:52420:153"/>
allow: and yet he owns it so frankly, that no man can think he had the least doubt concerning it, as is evident from these Passages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lord Chief Justice asked me,</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Paper 1.</note> 
                     <hi>if I had taken the Sacrament to keep secret the Plot, as others did? I said, that I had not, because I would avoid the question, At whose hands it were?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If I be called in question for the</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Paper 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Priest in my Letter, I propose to name him</hi> Winscombe, <hi>unless I be advised other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</hi> And speaking of the same Priest, he saith, <hi>I have not been asked his</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Paper 5.</note> 
                     <hi>name; which if I had, should have been such a one as I knew not any of.</hi> And in the next <hi>Letter, You forgot to tell me whether</hi> Winscombe <hi>be a fit name;</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Paper 6.</note> 
                     <hi>I like it, for I know none of it.</hi> By all which it appears, that he made no manner of scruple, to give in a false name upon examination.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That this was a real Plot, wherein several Popish <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites,</hi> and other Persons of Quality of that Religion were engaged: And not onely so, but that if it had taken effect, an <hi>Association</hi> of Foreign Princes of that Religion, by a Solemn Oath, like that <note n="*" place="margin">Paper 9.</note> of the <hi>Holy League</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd,
<pb facs="tcp:52420:153"/>
to have assur'd the business after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>And is it not strange, that after all this, men should have the face to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a thing so notorious to all the world? and to lay it upon the Kings <hi>Ministers,</hi> as a State-Contrivance, on purpose to make the <hi>Papists</hi> odious?</p>
                  <p>Why was not this said before, by those who were likely, and most concern'd to know it? This <hi>Gentleman</hi> seems not to have had the least suspicion of any such matter: None of the <hi>Conspirators</hi> either at their Examination, or Trial, or Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, complained of it, that they were deceiv'd and dwn in; and if they had, they had nevertheless been Traitors: None of the <hi>Apologists</hi> of that time for this black Conspiracy, neither <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> nor <hi>Eudaemon Johannes,</hi> nor any other that I have seen, do suggest any such thing, which they would most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have done, had they known the least ground for it. Nay, the late <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>English Jesuites,</hi> written by <hi>More,</hi> a <hi>Jesuite,</hi> and publish'd at St. <hi>Omers</hi> in 1660, doth fully own this horrid <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy</hi> of the Papists, and chargeth it <note n="*" place="margin">Hist. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glic. Soc. <hi>Iesu. l. 7. pag.</hi> 310.</note> solely upon them; onely he endeavours to clear the <hi>Jesuites</hi> of the contrivance of
<pb facs="tcp:52420:154"/>
this <hi>Design,</hi> acknowledging they were guilty of the concealment of it.</p>
                  <p>But now to come threescore years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to think to baffle all the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi> and <hi>Histories</hi> of that Time, by a bold and groundless surmise, that all this was a Contrivance of <hi>Secretary Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> without the least proof or evidence produced for it, is a confidence onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming such a <hi>Church,</hi> and such a <hi>Cause.</hi> To conclude this matter, Though the Priests of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church are able to impose so far upon the easie credulity of their People, as to persuade them every day to deny their Senses, and to believe contrary to what they plainly see; yet have they no reason to expect the same civility and compliance from us, whom they know to have, above an hundred years ago, taken up an obstinate resolution to believe our own Senses, against the confidence and presumption of any Church in the World.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. I Have not named any either living or <note place="margin">Paper 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> dead, that should have hurt my Lord Salisbury: and only intended these General Informations to procure me access of some Friend, that I might inform my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, for I never intended to hurt any Creature though it would have gained me all the world. As yet they have not got of me the affirming that I know any Priest particularly, nor shall ever do to the hurt of any but my self. At my first examination the Earl of Salisbury told me, that some things should be affirmed against <hi>me</hi> by Gerrat the Priest, who, saith he, I am sure you know well. My Answer was, that if I might see him, I would tell him whether I knew him or no, but by that name I did not know him, nor at Mrs. Vauxe's, as he said I did, for I never saw a Priest there. Yesterday I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. Attorney and my Lord Chief Justice, who asked me if I had taken the Sacrament to keep secret the Plot as others did. I said that I had not, because I would avoid the question of at whose hands it were. They told me that five had taken it of Gerrard, and that he knew of the Plot, which I said was more than I knew.</p>
                  <p>Now for my Intention let me tell you, that if I had thought there had been the least sin in the Plot, I would not have been of it for all the world: and no other cause drew me to hazard
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52420:156"/>
my Fortune and Life, but Zeal to Gods Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For my keeping it secret, it was caused by certain belief, that those which were best able to judge of the lawfulness of it, had been acquainted with it, and given way unto it. More reasons I had to perswade me to this belief than I dare utter, which I will never, to the suspicion of any, though I should to the Rack for it, and as I did not know it directly that it was approved by such, so did I hold it in my Conscience the best not to know any more if I might.</p>
                  <p>I have before all the Lords cleared all the Priests in it for any thing that I know, but now let me tell you, what a grief it hath been to me, to hear that so much Condemned which I did believe would have been otherwise thought on by Catholicks; there is no other cause but this, which hath made me desire Life, for when I came into Prison death would have been a Welcome Friend unto me, and was most desired; but when I heard how Catholicks and Priests thought of the matter, and that it should be a great sin that should be the <hi>Cause</hi> of my end, it called my Conscience in doubt of my very best Actions and Intentions in question: for I knew that my self might easily be deceived in such a Business, therefore I protest unto you that the doubts I had of my own Good State, which only proceeded from the censure of others, caused more bitterness of grief in me than all the miseries that ever I suffered, and only this caused me wish Life till I might meet with a Ghostly friend. For some good space I could do nothing, but with Tears ask pardon at Gods hands for all my Errors, both in Actions
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52420:156"/>
and Intentions in this Business, and in my whole life, which the censure of this contrary to my expectance caused me to doubt: I did humbly beseech that my Death might satisfie for my Offence, which I should and shall offer most gladly to the Giver of Life. I assure you as I hope in God that the love of all my Estate and wordly happiness did never trouble me, nor the love of it since my imprisonment did ever move me to wish life. But if that I may live to make satisfaction to God and the world where I have given any Scandal, I shall not grieve if I should never look Living Creature in the face again, and besides that deprivation endure all wordly misery. I shall not need to clear any living body either private or publick, for I never named any body, but reported that those that are dead did promise, that all Forces in those parts about Mr. Talbot would assist us, but this can hurt nothing, for they openly spoke it.

MY Dearest the I take at the uncharitable taking of these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <note place="margin">Paper 9.</note> will make me say more than ever I thought to have done. For if this Design had taken place, there could have been no doubt of other Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess: for that night, before any other could have brought the News, we should have known it by Mr. Catesby, who should have proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Heir Apparent at Charing-Cross, as he came out of Town; to which purpose there was a Proclamation Drawn; if the Duke had not been in the House, then was there a certain way layd for the possessing him; but in regard of the assurance, they should have been there, therefore the greatest of our business stood in the possessing the Lady Elisabeth, who lying within Eight Miles of Dunchurch, we would have easily surprised before the knowledge of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52420:160"/>
any doubt: this was the Cause of my being there. If she had been in Rutland, then Stoaks was near, and in either place we had taken suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Order to have been possessed of her; there was also courses taken for the satisfying the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple if the first had taken effect, as the speedy notice of Liberty and Freedom from all manner of Slavery, as the ceasing of Wardships and all Monopolies, which with Change would have been more plausible to the people, if the first had been, than it is now. There was also a course taken to have given present notice to all Princes, and to <hi>Associate</hi> them with an Oath answerable to the League <hi>in</hi> France. I have not uttered any of these things, nor ever thought to do; for my going from Dunchurch I had this Reason. First I knew that Faux could reveal me, for I must make choice of two besides Mr. Catesby, which I did of him and Mr. Winter. I knew he had been imployed in great matters, and till torture sure he carryed it very well. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we all thought if we could procure Mr. Talbot, to rise that party at least to a Composition that was not little, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we had in our Company his Son in Law, who gave us some hope of, and did not much doubt it. I do answer your speech with Mr. Brown thus. Before that I knew any thing of this Plot, I did ask Mr. Farmer what the meaning of the Popes Brief was; he told me that they were not (meaning Priests) to undertake or procure stirrs: but yet they would not hinder any, neither was it the Popes mind they should, that should be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52420:160"/>
for Catholick good. I did never utter thus much, nor would not but to you; and this Answer with Mr. Catesbyes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings with him and me, gave me absolute belief that the matter in general was approved, though every particular was not known. I dare not take that course that I could, to make it appear less Odious; for divers were to have been brought out of the danger, which now would rather hurt them than otherwise. I do not think there would have been three worth Saving that should have been lost; you may guess that I had some Friends that were in danger, which I had prevented, but they shall never know it. I will do as much as my Partner wisheth, and it will then appear, that I have not hurt or accused one man, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever I might in general possess them with fear, in hope to do the Cause good, yet my care was ever to lose my own Life, rather than hurt the unworthiest Member of the Catholick Church.

                  <p>THere be many reasons (my dear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) that might disswade me from putting Pen to Paper in this kind, and onely one which urgeth me to undertake this poor and fruitless pains. Wherefore to tell you what inciteth me to it, is my want of other means to shew my Fatherly affection to each of you: (which is so far from uttering, as my mind is willing to accept of poor means, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than none to bewray my disposition) if I would have been checked from the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of these lines, by number and probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of reasons; I might then have called to mind the unlikelihood, that these would ever have come to your view; with the malice of the world to me, which (I do imagine) will not fail to endeavour to possess you with a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to hear of any thing that comes from me: as also I might, and do think, on my own disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in advising, with many other disswasive reasons, which my former recited single stirrer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up hath banished.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to begin with both and each of you, I send you by these my Fatherly and last blessing; which I have not failed to ask at Gods hands on my knees, that he will grant to descend so effectually on you (that his holy grace accompanying it) it may work in you the performance (on your part) of Gods sweet
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:52420:162"/>
and just commandments; and on his part to you, the Guerdon that his mercy inricheth his Servants withall.</p>
                  <p>Let this end (Gods Service I mean) be the chief and onely contentious strife between you, which with all vehemency and desire each of you may strive to attain soonest. Let this be the mark which your thoughts and actions may still level at; for here is the chiefest Prise, to recompense the best deserver. Believe me in this (my Sons) that though my unripe years afford me not general experience, yet my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of courses in the world (and Gods grace to illumine me) may sufficiently warrant the verity of this principle. If you make this your chief business, (as you ought to do, and for which end onely you were sent into the world) I doubt not but God will send you better means for your particular directions, than either the brevity of a Letter, or my ability can discharge. So that in this I will say no more, but pray that you may live as I hope to die, which is in the perfect obedience of the Catholick and onely saving Church.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but a little touch, what I could wish you did, and I hope will do to all sorts of people; it is a lesson I could never learn well my self, but perhaps see more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for others, than that I were ever able to shew the force of wholesome counsel, and good instructions in my own life.</p>
                  <p>Above all things in the world, seek to obey and follow your Mothers will and pleasure; who as she hath been the best wife to me that ever man enjoyed, so can she not fail to shew
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52420:162"/>
her self equal to the best Mother, if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve not the contrary. If it please God to send her life, (though you have nothing else) I shall leave you enough: And on the contrary, if I could leave you ten times more than my self ever had, yet she being taken from you, I should think you but poor. It is not (my Sons) abundance of riches that makes a man happy, but a virtuous life; and as they are blessings from God, and cause of happiness to a man that useth them well, so are they cause of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery to most men even in this world.</p>
                  <p>You may read of divers men, who whiles they lived in private state, deserved the fame of all that knew them; but so soon as prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fortune, and higher degrees, had taken pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of them, they seemed not to be the same men, but grew into scorn of all the world. For example, <hi>Galba,</hi> whiles he lived in <hi>Spain</hi> as a private man, and, as it were, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished his Countrey, by a Charge that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in him great pains and care; he was so well liked, that upon the death of <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperor, he was Elected in his room; but was no sooner in that Place, than he was plucked out of it again by violent death, as a man unfit for such a Charge, by reason of his alteration which that Dignity wrought in him.</p>
                  <p>You may see also in <hi>Otho,</hi> who succeeded him, that all the while of his prosperity, he lived a most dissolute life, and odious to all men; but he was no sooner touched with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, but he grew to a brave and worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, making choice rather (not out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration)
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:52420:163"/>
of his own death, than that by his life the Common-weal sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e disturbed. And though I cannot but disallow the manner of his death, (by reason he knew not God truly) yet is it plain, that adversity brought him to that worthy mind, which contemned life in regard of his Countreys good; and which was so contrary to that mind that prosperity had missed in him. If then adverse Fortune were so powerful, more than prosperity, in Pagans and Misbelievers, to procure in them worthy minds; what may we expect the force of it should be in Christians, whose first Captain (not out of necessity, but free choice) made manifest to the world, by his own painful footsteps, that there is no other perfect and certain way to true happiness.</p>
                  <p>He hath not onely staid here in demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his verity, but hath sent to all those (who, the world knows, he highliest esteemed, and best loved) nothing but variety of misery in this life, with cruel and forced death; the which thing truest wisdom esteems as the best tokens of Love from so powerful a Sender, and as the best and certainest way to bring a man to perfect happiness.</p>

                  <p>But howsoever you find your selves in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of this world, use them to Gods best pleasure, and think your selves but Bailiffs of such things for an uncertain time. If they be few or poor, your fear of making a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt may be the lesser; and know, that God can send more and richer, if it be requisite for his glory and your good: if they be many or great, so much the more care you ought to take in governing your selves, lest God, as holding you unworthy such a charge, by taking them from you, or you from them, do also pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish you with eternal misery, for abusing his benefits. You shall the better learn to make true use and reckoning of these vanities, if with due obedience you do hearken to your Mothers wholesome counsel; and what want you shall find in my instructions, you may see better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to you by looking on her life, which though I cannot give assurance for any thing to be done in future times, yet can I not but very stedfastly believe, that the same Lord will give perseverance in vertue, where he hath laid so strong a foundation for his Spiritual building, and where there is such an humble and resigned will to the pleasure of her Lord and Maker.</p>
                  <p>The next part of my Charge shall be, in your mutual carriage the one to the other; in which, all reasons to move you to perfect accord, and entire love, do present themselves unto you, as the obligation of Christianity, the tie of natural and nearest Consanguinity, and the equality, or
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52420:164"/>
very small difference of Age. There is in none of these any thing wanting, that may be an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment to truest Friendship, nor any thing to be added to them (for procuring your mutual and heartiest love) but your own consent and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular desert each to other. Since then there is all cause in each of you for this love, do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive your selves of that earthly happiness, which God, Nature, and Time offereth unto you: but if you think that the benefit which accord and friendship bringeth, be not sufficient to enkindle this love, (which God forbid you should) yet let the consideration of the misery which the contrary worketh in all degrees, stay your mind from dislike.</p>
                  <p>As no man in any Age, but may see great happiness to have been attained by good agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Friends, Kinsmen, and Brethren; so wanteth there not too many examples of such, as by hate and discord have frustrated strong hopes sowed in peace, and brought to nothing great Fortunes; besides the incurring Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, which still comes accompanied with perpetual misery. If you look into Divine Writ, you shall find, that this was the cause of <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi>'s misery, which the least hard hap that came to either of them, was to be murdered by his Brother.</p>
                  <p>If you look into Humane Stories, you need search no further to behold a most pitiful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, than the two Sons of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> whose dislike each to other was so deeply rooted, that at length it burst forth to open complaints, the one of the other, to good old
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52420:164"/>
                     <hi>Philip;</hi> who seeing it, could not be put off from a publick hearing, called both his Sons, <hi>(Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Perseus)</hi> and in both their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made a most effectual speech of concord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; but finding that it would not take effect, gave them free leave to wound his heart with their unnatural accusations, the one against the other; which staid not there, by the unjust hastning of their Fathers sudden death, but caused the murther of one of them, with the utter overthrow of that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and the misery of the Survivor. These things (I hope) will not be so necessary for your use, as they are hurtless to know, and effectual where need requires.</p>
                  <p>Besides these examples, and fore-recited ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, let me joyn a Fathers charge, which ought not to be slightly esteemed in so just a cause. Let me tell you, my Son Kenelm, that you ought to be both a Father and a Brother to your unprovided for Brother, and think, that what I am hindred from performing to him by short life, and voluntary tie of my Land to you; so much account your self bound to do to him, both in Brotherly affection to him, and in natural duty to me. And you, my Son <hi>Iohn,</hi> know I send you as Fatherly a Blessing, as if I had also given you a great Patrimony; and that if my life had permitted, I would have done my endeavour that way. If you find any thing in that kind to come from your Brother, take it the more thankfully; but if that you do not, let it not lessen your love to him, who ought

not to be loved by you for his Fortune or Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but for himself. I am sorry that I am cut off by time from saying so much as I did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at the first; but since I may not, I will commend in my Prayers your instruction and guidance to the Giver of all goodness, who ever bless and keep you.</p>

                     <l>The substance of that shadow causing woe:</l>

                     <l>Not onely mine, but others grief did grow</l>
                     <l>By my misdeed, which grieves me most of all,</l>
                     <l>That I should be chief cause of others fall.</l>

                     <l>For private loss to grieve, when others have no cause</l>
                     <l>Of sorrow, is unmeet for worthy mind;</l>

                     <l>More just revenge, than he on earth can find.</l>
                     <l>But to undo desert and innocence,</l>

                     <l>Though different that were from present case;</l>

                     <l>Of all the world were blustred in my face.</l>
                     <l>But Oh I grieve to think that ever I</l>
                     <l>Have been a means of others misery.</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>When on my little Babes I think, as I do oft,</l>
                     <l>I cannot chuse but then let fall some tears:</l>
                     <l>Me-thinks I hear the little Pratler, with words soft,</l>
                     <l>Ask, Where is Father that did promise Pears,</l>
                     <l>And other Knacks, which I did never see,</l>
                     <l>Nor Father neither, since he promis'd me.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:52420:166"/>
                     <l>'Tis true, my Babe, thou never saw'st thy Father since,</l>
                     <l>Nor art thou ever like to see again:</l>
                     <l>That stopping Father into mischief which will pinch</l>
                     <l>The tender Bud, and give thee cause to plain</l>
                     <l>His hard dysaster; that must punish thee,</l>
                     <l>Who art from guilt as any Creature free.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>But Oh! when she that bare thee, Babe, comes to my mind,</l>
                     <l>Then do I stand as drunk with bitterest woe,</l>
                     <l>To think that she, whose worth were such to all, should find</l>
                     <l>Such usage hard, and I to cause the blow,</l>
                     <l>Of her such sufferance, that doth pierce my heart,</l>
                     <l>And gives full grief to every other part.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Hence comes the cause, that each tear striveth to be first,</l>
                     <l>As if I meant to stint them of their course.</l>
                     <l>No salted meats: that done, you know my heart would burst</l>
                     <l>With violent assaults of your great force:</l>
                     <l>But when I stay you, 'tis for that I fear,</l>
                     <l>Your gushing so will leave me ne'er a tear.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>But ah! this doubt, Grief says, I never need to fear,</l>
                     <l>For she will undertake t' afford me store;</l>
                     <l>Who in all her knowledge never cause of woe did hear</l>
                     <l>That gall'd her deeper, or gave witness more</l>
                     <l>Of earths hard usage, that does punish those,</l>
                     <l>That guiltless be, with Fortunes cruellest blows.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Though further cause of more than utterable grief,</l>
                     <l>As others loss, I could dilate at large,</l>
                     <l>Which I am cause of, yet her suffering being chief</l>
                     <l>Of all their woes, that sail in this deep Barge</l>
                     <l>Of sorrows Sea: I cannot but reflect</l>
                     <l>Hereon more deeply, and with more respect.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>On which dear object when I look with grieved mind,</l>
                     <l>Such store of pities see I plead her case,</l>
                     <l>As hardest heart cause of compassion there would find,</l>
                     <l>To hear what could be said before that face,</l>
                     <l>Which I have worng'd in causing so to weep,</l>
                     <l>The grief whereof constrains my Pen to sleep.</l>
