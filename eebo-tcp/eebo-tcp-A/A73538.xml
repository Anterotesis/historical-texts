            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Richard Bowdler, <hi>Plaintif.</hi> George Morgan, <hi>Defendant.</hi>
            </head>
            <head>This Bill is an humble Petition of <hi>Richard Bowdler</hi> and <hi>William Meggs,</hi> that a Report and Decree, <hi>thereupon made in the high Court of Chancerie betweene</hi> George Morgan <hi>and them, and others, and all Fines impoſed</hi> vpon them for not performing of the ſame to be void, And that an Arbitrement made at the deſire of the Parties may be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and confirmed by Act of Parliament for theſe Cauſes.</head>
            <p>FIrſt, That <hi>Morgan</hi> was called to account by <hi>Bowdler,</hi> by Bill in Chauncery, as his Factor, for diuers yeares; That he might be releeued againſt certayne falſe Accounts exhibited by him; whereunto <hi>Morgan</hi> did anſwere, and preferred a croſſe Bill againſt the Petitioners and others, charging them as Partners with matters of Account.</p>
            <p>The Court by conſent of the parties and their learned Councell, awarded a Commiſſion to <hi>Rowland Backhouſe, Robert Ducy, Tho. Morley, Ralph Core,</hi> and <hi>Ro. Palmer,</hi> Merchants of London, with authoritie to examine and determine theſe Accounts and Differences, wherein for their ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they pervſed and conſidered of all Bookes of Account, Bills of Exchange, Letters and other Writings produced concerning the ſame, but becauſe the Commiſſion was returnable before they could conclude any thing, the parties importuned them to end the ſaid Accounts and Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences by Arbitrement, and ſubmitted themſelues to their Award by ſeuerall Obligations of great ſummes of money, bearing date the 7. day of October 1018. And for the better ſtrengthning of their proceedings in the ſaid Arbitrarie courſe. The Lord Chancellor was pleaſed to graunt a Commiſſion bearing date the 19. day of the ſame moneth, with power to take oath of the Parties and Witneſſes; and to determine the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences or to certifie their proceedings. And his Lordſhip did write his honourable Letters to fiue other Merchants to giue their aſſiſtance, as oft as the ſaid Arbitrators ſhould thinke ſit.</p>
            <p>And after 160. meetings and exact examination of all Differences and Accounts aforeſaid, the ſaid Arbitrators being often aided by the ſaid Aſſiſtants, they did finde <hi>Morgan</hi> indebted vnto <hi>Bowdler</hi> in the ſumme of 579<abbr>l.</abbr> 6<abbr>s.</abbr> which they did Award he ſhould pay vnto <hi>Bowdler</hi> the 6. of Aprill following. And alſo by their ſaid Award did order and determine what each Partie ſhould performe to other, as particularly at large there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by appeareth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For that the ſaid Arbitrement being after called in queſtion by the ſaid <hi>Morgan</hi> by falſe ſuggeſtion that it was partially made: the ſaid Arbitrators being required to certifie their proceedings to the Court, did ſo certifie, Anſwering thereby all Obiections, and declaring that <hi>William Meggs</hi> was no wiſe chargeable vnto <hi>Morgan,</hi> but that he was vniuſtly vexed by his ſaid ſuite: Neuertheleſſe, by Orders in the ſaid Court the ſaid Award was ſuſpended which ought rather to haue beene put in execution. And the Bonds ſealed to performe the ſame were called into the Court, And all Bonds, Bills, &amp;c. which the Commiſſioners had receiued of <hi>Morgan</hi> were redeliuered to him, albeit they appertayned to <hi>Bowdler</hi> as being accounted for before the Commiſſioners.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe the truth of <hi>Bowdlers</hi> cauſe, being a diſcouerie of falſities and miſpriſions in a Factors Accounts, could not bee ſo euident by examination vpon fixed Intergatories, as it was apparant to the Commiſſioners that had therein proceeded as afore; His Lordſhip cauſed them to certifie particularly the Reaſons that moued them to make the ſaid arbitrement, which they did accordingly. Whereupon (for that the ſaid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement was grounded aſwell vpon examination of Witneſſes as vpon <hi>Morgans</hi> confeſſion and otherwiſe, And that particular Relation thereof was made by the ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Witneſſes but the Cauſe comming to hearing the 18. day of December then following, by order of Chancerit the ſaid Award and Certificat were made void, and the Commiſſioners branded with infamie and diſgrace without being called to anſwere for themſelues. And without a Bill exhibited to ſhew the defects of their Award, And a new Reference to Sir <hi>Robert Rich</hi> and Sir <hi>William Bird,</hi> two Maſters of the Chancerie, and foure other Merchants was made to examine the ſaid Accounts and Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, but without power to examine vpon oath.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, For that the ſaid Maſters and Merchants were directed by the Chancerie to proceed onely vpon proofes taken in Court, and vpon Depoſitions taken before the ſaid Arbitrators and vpon Accounts, Letters and Writings, ſuch as could bee iuſtified by two Witneſſes, (neither Arbitrators nor Parties) to haue beene produced and allowed before the Arbitrators, which kind of proofe was not poſſible to be made, for that there was none preſent at the debating of the Cauſe, but the Arbitrator and Parties whereby <hi>Bowdler</hi> was bereaued of the benefit of his proofes, and of <hi>Morgans</hi> confeſsion, And depriued of the meanes to manifeſt the truth. Alſo the Depoſitions taken on <hi>Bowdlers</hi> behalfe before the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators were reiected, but all Depoſitions on the ſaid <hi>Morgans</hi> behalfe were allowed; whereupon the ſaid Maſters with their Aſſiſtants reported, that the ſaid <hi>Bowdler</hi> was indebted to <hi>Morgan</hi> in the ſumme 7486<abbr>l.</abbr> 1<abbr>s.</abbr> 10<abbr>d.</abbr> And the ſame report was decreed notwithſtanding any thing that was offred againſt it.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Albeit <hi>Meggs</hi> were admitted to ſupplimentall proofes, and the two Maſters were to conſider whether <hi>Meggs</hi> were partner with <hi>Bowdler,</hi> and whether <hi>Meggs</hi> his lending <hi>Bowdler</hi> his credit did occaſion <hi>Morgans</hi> ingagements; and what eſtate of <hi>Bowdler</hi> came to <hi>Meggs</hi> his hands, and when; yet after ſupplimentall proofe made by <hi>Meggs</hi> and <hi>Morgan;</hi> The two Maſters did certifie that <hi>Meggs</hi> was Partner with <hi>Bowdler;</hi> and that <hi>Morgans</hi> ingagements were occaſioned by <hi>Meggs</hi> his aſſiſting <hi>Bowdler</hi> with his credit: And that there was of <hi>Bowdlers</hi> eſtate in the hands of <hi>Meggs</hi> the ſumme of 10063<abbr>l.</abbr> 11<abbr>s.</abbr> 7<abbr>d.</abbr> Whereas it is moſt apparant that <hi>Meggs</hi> was not Partner with <hi>Bowdler</hi> in <hi>Morgans</hi> imployments, Nor that <hi>Morgans</hi> ingagements were occaſioned by his lending his credit to <hi>Bowdler,</hi> nor that he had any eſtate of <hi>Bowdlers</hi> in his hands, but that <hi>Bowdler</hi> was iuſtly indebted to <hi>Meggs</hi> in 1500. And it is moſt cleare that <hi>Meggs</hi> is not to be charged vnto <hi>Morgan</hi> by the cuſtome of Merchants, nor by the Law for aſſiſting <hi>Bowdler</hi> with his credit; And there is nothing to leade the Maſters to conceaue that the ſaid <hi>Meggs</hi> ſhould haue of the ſaid <hi>Bowdlers</hi> eſtate in his hands the ſumme of 10063<abbr>l.</abbr> 11<abbr>s.</abbr> 7<abbr>d.</abbr> But this report induced his Lordſhip to decree, That <hi>Meggs</hi> ſhould be aſwell char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as <hi>Bowdler</hi> with the payment of the ſaid 7486<abbr>l.</abbr> 1<abbr>s.</abbr> 10<abbr>d.</abbr> And the fift of December laſt his Lordſhip impoſed a Fine of one Thouſand pounds a peece vpon the ſaid <hi>Meggs</hi> and <hi>Bowdler</hi> for <hi>non</hi>-performance of the ſaid Decree; And thereupon a <hi>Scire facias</hi> hath beene Awarded.</p>
            <div type="petition_proper">
               <p>Foraſmuch, As no redreſſe of ſuch Decrees is to bee had but in Parliament: The humble Petition of <hi>Bowdler</hi> and <hi>Meggs</hi> is, that all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in Chancerie may be declared to be void, And the ſaid Award eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament, to bee performed for the Cauſes and Reaſons aforeſaid.</p>
