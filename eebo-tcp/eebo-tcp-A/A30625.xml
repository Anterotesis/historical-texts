            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>AN Obſerving <hi>Italian</hi> has given us an Account of a Tranſaction, which is not ſo well known amongſt us, as many others of the like Nature. He acquaints us, that in an Aſſembly of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, as he calls them, which were brought together by the Late Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> a Conſultation was held con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the fitteſt Means of propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Religion in this Kingdom:
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:65847:3"/>
and they agreed, that one of the moſt proper Methods they could make uſe of for that purpoſe, was, to teſtifie a mighty Zeal, and to make a great ſhew of Friendſhip, for the Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts. Whereupon, he tells us, They repreſented them as Men of Trade, whoſe Sufferings would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the Nation. They preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to commiſerate their Condition, and declaim'd perpetually againſt Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And there were two things, he ſays, which they propos'd to themſelves in this Conduct.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Il primo di mantenere le Sette contra la Chieſa d' Inghilter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, ſperando con queſto mezo di de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrugerla più toſto, riſpetto alle tante animoſita inteſtine, che ſenza dubbio haurebbono aperte più facilmente le Porte al Papiſmo: il ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condo che ſotto queſto preteſto di toleratione de Settari, non poteſſero le Leggi haver campo libero all' eſecuttione, in quello che riguarda la Religione, e coſi foſſe più facile a loro Preti d' avanzar la Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gione Romana.</note> The firſt, was to maintain the <hi>Sectaries</hi> againſt the <hi>Church of England</hi>; hoping they might ſooner deſtroy it by Inteſtine Diviſions, and ſo more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily open a Gate to Popery. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:65847:3"/>
was, Under a pretence of tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe Sectaries, to ſtop the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Laws about Religion, that their Prieſts might meet with leſs op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in advancing the Religion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In purſuance of this Deſign, as my Author alſo informs us, They prevail'd with King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second to iſſue out his Declaration for Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; which was recall'd by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Parliament: But the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which was then ſo happily bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fted by the Parliament, reviv'd to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement in the following Reign, and the Nation had the pain to ſee a <hi>Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite</hi> made a Privy Counſellor and Prime Miniſter of State, and the Proteſtant Diſſenters very deep in his Intereſts, and warm under his Influence; To ſee theſe Diſſenters ſo liberally offering up their Incenſe to the Court, which was then labouring to inſlave us to the Pope; and the Court anſwering their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:65847:4"/>
with many Favors. For ſo it was, as every Body knows: And when this Alliance was confirm'd between them, hardly a Week paſs'd over our heads, which did not bring us freſh Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of their mutual Endearments.</p>
            <p>What I have ſaid of the Diſſenters, muſt not be underſtood of the whole Body of them without exception: For to do them Right, ſome of them were afflicted at the ſhameful Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy in which their Brethren were engaged: But neither in Number, nor in Zeal and Diligence did they equal thoſe that beheld our Church in diſtreſs, with ſuch Eyes, as the Children of <hi>Edom</hi> look'd on <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the day of her Adverſity, when they cry'd to the <hi>Babylonians, Raſe it, raſe it to the foundation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it pleas'd God to diſappoint their Devices, ſo that their hands could not perform their Enterpriſe: And one might then have thought, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on their Actions, ſhould have
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:65847:4"/>
been ſuch a Mortification to them, as would have diſpos'd them to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation and Union with thoſe, from whom they had made an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Separation; and who were ſo willing to forget their former Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, and to receive them with all imaginable Tenderneſs. But they, on the contrary, have ſince appear'd more averſe from the Way of Peace than ever. And it is Obſervable, that the Kindneſs of the Papiſts, put them into a ſtrange fit of Complaiſance, and was the Cauſe, that either they employ'd their Pens in the ſervice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or not againſt it: But the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations which they have receiv'd from the Conformiſts, inſtead of abating, have inflam'd their Rage, and given them Encouragement to write abundance of Books, ſuch as they are, againſt the <hi>Church of England.</hi> And this may ſhew, how diſſatisfied they remain in their preſent Circumſtances, and that
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:65847:5"/>
as long as we live <hi>with them,</hi> and not <hi>under them,</hi> we are like to hear of their Complaints.</p>
            <p>When my Adverſary, who is of their number, and gave occaſion to this Diſcourſe, ſaw Their Politicks, and his Own defeated, I had hopes that he would leave me to the Retirement I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and give me no farther trouble with his Diſputes about Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. I was in expectation, that he would either ſtudy to be quiet, or that I ſhould meet with him amongſt ſome late Apologiſts. But when I leaſt ſuſpected it, he appears in Print on the Offenſive ſide, and rudely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking a whole Community, he would perſuade his Readers <note n="*" place="margin">Nat. of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>p. 46, 47.</hi>
               </note>, that a <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate National Juriſdiction,</hi> ſuch as he ſuppoſes that of our Eccleſiaſtical Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to be, cannot but <hi>weaken the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Kings and other States, and is neither more nor leſs, but the very ſame thing that heretofore was found ſo bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſom
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:65847:5"/>
under the Papacy, and that made the beſt and wiſeſt and greateſt of our Kings ſo uneaſie. So that he lays it down,</hi> he ſays, <hi>as a Maxim, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be of greater danger to any Government, than a National Hierarchy, that does not depend upon it, or is not in the Meaſures and Intereſts of it. Freſh Experience has learn'd us this.</hi> In which words, his deſign is to caſt an Odium on the Conforming Clergy, and to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, that they have been hurtful unto Kings, and uſurpt a Juriſdiction that is inconſiſtent with the Safety, and the Rights of Sovereignty. But if this cannot be prov'd againſt them, either from the Nature of their Juriſdiction it ſelf, or from their National Union, or Matter of Fact, on which he grounds the Charge, he muſt be content to bear the Infamy of a falſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer.</p>
            <p>By the Juriſdiction of the Clergy, which is firſt to be conſider'd, either he
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:65847:6"/>
underſtands, that which is Spiritual, and ſuch as the Paſtors of the Church receiv'd from Chriſt; and to ſay that this hath no Limits, and is pernicious to the State, is not only to injure the Truth, but to caſt a Reproach upon our Lord himſelf: Or elſe he means their Temporal Authority, with which they have been legally veſted by Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Princes, and then he knows that he hath falſly call'd it <hi>Independent, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundable</hi> and <hi>Uncontrollable</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 46.</note>: he knows it is falſe, that this is neither more nor leſs, but the very ſame Supreme and Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Power which the Popes claim'd and uſurpt, and by which they made our Kings ſo Uneaſie: And I leave him to anſwer the Convictions of his own Conſcience, for the wrong he hath done the Reformation by ſo odious a Reflexion.</p>
            <p>Another thing on which he grounds his Cenſure of the Clergy, is their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Union; and he argues, that This,
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:65847:6"/>
together with the Independence which he aſcribes to them, muſt needs render them very dangerous, as putting them into a <hi>condition of being made a powerful Faction, and eaſie to be practis'd upon; and inabling the Heads of the Faction to convey Malignity to all their Subordinates, and theſe to the People</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 47.</note>. And thus, when the aboliſhing of the Epiſcopal Government <hi>with all its dependences, Root and Branch,</hi> was in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Fiennes</hi> objected <note n="‖" place="margin">See his Speech <hi>A. D.</hi> 1640. in <hi>Nalſon</hi>'s <hi>Collect. Vol.</hi> 1. p. 758.</note> againſt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, That by their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over other Miniſters, who had an influence upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>they might mould them both according to their own wills; and having put out our eyes,</hi> ſays he, <hi>as the Philiſtins did</hi> Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<hi>'s, they may afterwards make us grind, and reduce us to what ſlavery they pleaſe.</hi> A dreadful thing indeed, had there been any foundation for the apprehenſion of it. But if ſuch Fantômes as may at
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:65847:7"/>
any time be rais'd by Art or the Strength of Imagination, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them of Subſtance or Reality, be ſufficient to diſquiet us, we are like to enjoy but little reſt. And to come nearer to the purpoſe; If a meer poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of doing hurt, be ſo dangerous and formidable to Princes, This would be enough to create in them frightful Idea's of their Guards and their Armies, and of all that are about them, and render them at laſt, like <hi>Paſhur, a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He could not but ſee, that a meer Capacity in the Clergy of conveying Malignity, was not ſufficient to make them Enemies to the State; and he pretends, that they have been actually guilty of a moſt notorious defection from their Duty to the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and that it has been found by Experience, not only that there never was, but that there never can be in the World, a thing more dangerous to any
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:65847:7"/>
Government, than the <hi>National Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</hi> An Accuſation that ſounds very harſh, and runs high, not againſt a few ſingle perſons only, but a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Society. But he hath not told us, in what Inſtance they were liable to it, or when it was they became ſo criminal.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> they could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſo hateful a Character. For Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as She was of her Glory, She could not find, that it was eclips'd by them. But She did perceive, how neceſſary it was, to check and repreſs the Attempts againſt them, and was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us <note n="*" rend="inter">Regina haud ignara ſuam Authoritatem per E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcoporum latera in hoc nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio peti, &amp;c. <hi>Camd. Hiſt. Eliz. A. D. 1591.</hi>
               </note> that her own Authority was ſtruck at through the ſides of the Biſhops. As this Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Princeſs penetrated into the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of Foreign Courts, ſo She perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood the Intereſts of her own
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:65847:8"/>
Kingdoms: And if any would know, what She thought of ſome fiery Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots of thoſe Times, who ſpent their Heats in oppoſing Epiſcopacy and the Liturgy, it may be ſeen in Serjeant <hi>Puckering</hi>'s Speech, recorded by Sr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Dugdale</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="margin">View of the Troubles in <hi>England, p. 13.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time he complain'd of the Contempt that was caſt on a Church ſo Reform'd, and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours thereof; and looking on it as a ſign of Impending Judgments, he ſays, <hi>God will not bleſs us and our Laws, if we do not reverence and obey Gods Law, which cannot be, except the Interpreters of it be reſpected and reverenced.</hi> Such a regard He had for them, from a Principle of Religion; and their Fidelity to Him was anſwerable to it; and contributed not a little to the Safety of his Perſon, the Support of the Throne, and the Welfare of the Nation.

Nor was our Author wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in plain terms to inform us, when it was that they became ſuch Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Malignity, leſt the Calumny might eaſily be detected. Yet, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure as he is, he hath left us a Key to his meaning: for he intimates, that they have been found to be dangerous by <hi>freſh experience,</hi> when they were not in the <hi>Meaſures and Intereſts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> reſpecting doubtleſs the late
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:65847:10"/>
Times, before the great Revolution. And ſo the Secret comes out, which was at the bottom, and rais'd his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.</p>
            <p>In the Opinion you ſee of this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, the Clergy were Then ſo very dangerous, when with ſo much Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage they threw themſelvs in the Breach that was made by the Diſpenſing Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and were aſſerting and labouring to preſerve our Laws and Liberties, which others were offering up in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: They were then conveying their Malignity to the People, when in their Books and Sermons, they defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Cauſe of the Reformation with ſo much Succeſs, that Popery lay Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſping before them in great Agonies, notwithſtanding the Cordials that were adminiſtred to it by other hands. And Then indeed the King was uneaſie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Endeavours, to eſtabliſh his Religion, did not make the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions he deſir'd: And the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:65847:11"/>
their Aſſociats were uneaſie, becauſe their Meaſures were broken, and their expectation of extirpating the <hi>Northern</hi> Hereſie defeated: And ſuch of the Diſſenters, as had been aſſiſting and puſhing them on in works of darkneſs, were uneaſie at the Reproach they had brought upon themſelves by their ill Conduct. But in the reſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there appear'd a general ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to ſee Truth prevailing by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Methods, againſt the Errors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when they were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with a powerful Protection.</p>
            <p>One may wonder, what it is that induced our Author to lead our thoughts to the Tranſactions of thoſe Times; ſince it would be more for his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could he bury them in Oblivion, or cover them with a Veil of Darkneſs. But it ſeems, he cannot diſſemble how much he was affected with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Affairs, when himſelf was in the <hi>Intereſts and Meaſures of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
               <pb n="xix" facs="tcp:65847:11"/>
and when in a Pamphlet In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, <hi>Prudential Reaſons for repealing the Penal Laws againſt all Recuſants,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Penn'd by a Proteſtant Perſon of Quality,</hi> he declar'd to the World, that King <hi>James</hi> the Second <hi>had a clearer proſpect of his own and the Kingdoms Intereſt, than any of his Royal Predeceſſors ever had, and purſu'd it with that Conduct and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, which did correſpond with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles that preſerv'd the Crown for him, and him for the Crown, and for a Glory greater than that of wearing Crowns, to wit, to be the Reſtorer of Religion to Liberty and Freedom of Exerciſe.</hi> And with ſuch exquiſite and ſervile Flattery, was that Unfortunate Prince encouraged in the <hi>Large Steps</hi> he made to his Ruine.</p>
            <p>That I have imputed to my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary the Harangue which I have quoted from the <hi>Prudential Reaſons,</hi> you will not think ſtrange, when I have told you, that ſometime ſince I received ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Controverſial Letters, written by
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:65847:12"/>
the hand of a Non-Conformiſt Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, who ſubſcrib'd them in his own Name, and profeſs'd and perſuaded his Eaſie Followers, that they were his own: But he could not deny, when the Charge was lay'd before him, that they were compos'd by the <hi>Proteſtant Perſon of Quality,</hi> as he is pleas'd to call himſelf, who hath lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd ſome part of them, to which this Treatiſe contains an Anſwer. But how his <hi>Amanuenſis</hi> reſents this uſage, or contented he is to be ſtript of his bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed Plumes, and left naked to the Pity or Deriſion of Spectators, as they are variouſly affected, I pretend not to diſcover. Some may think he hath had very hard meaſure, and that he had much better never have enjoy'd the Glory of his Maſters labours, than be depriv'd of it in ſuch a manner; but that I leave to be adjuſted between themſelves. And I had not ſaid thus much of their Combination, but out
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:65847:12"/>
of great Compaſſion to a deluded Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that I may let them ſee, if they do not wilfully ſhut their eyes on what it is they grounded their inſolent boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; by what Impoſtures they have been abus'd, and by what Arts they have been engaged and encourag'd in their Schiſm.</p>
            <p>Here it may be fit to take notice, that ſince our Author appear'd in open light, his Style differs much from what it was before: For many Pages of his Manuſcript Papers, which I have by me, are fill'd with bitter Invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and other Conformiſts; but it is in ſome meaſure true, what he now ſays, that his Printed Letters are refin'd from Perſonal Reflexions. He thought, it ſeems, that Scurrility was ſuitable enough to the part he acted, when he ſuſtain'd the perſon of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and was aſham'd of it, when he laid aſide his diſguiſe. Yet ſince he ſhews no Repentance for his former
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:65847:13"/>
Provocations, nor forbears to ſtrike at the whole Body of the Conforming Clergy, ſome may object, that I have handled him with an exceſs of Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. But I wiſh no greater defects may be found in this Diſcourſe, than that I have err'd on the ſide of Lenity, and I ſhall not be much concern'd at this Exception. Nevertheleſs my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary may be aſſur'd, that ſuch a Conduct as his muſt needs have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken'd the obſervation of many, and I cannot promiſe, that others will ſpare him, as I have done; or that he may not receive ſuch Correction from a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer Hand, as he is not Stoick enough to bear.</p>
            <p>For my part, I could have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, if he had refin'd away none of his <hi>Perſonal Reflexions.</hi> I was willing enough that the World ſhould have ſeen with what an impotent Fury I have been aſſaulted by him, and I ſhould have been glad to have been
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:65847:13"/>
eas'd of the Fatigue of writing and giving a new Turn to the Anſwers I had ſent him. But for his own ſake, I congratulate to him any Tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Calmneſs of Thought, and ſtill retain for him the Regard that is due to an Intelligent Perſon, of a ſharp Wit, great Reading and indefatigable Induſtry.</p>
            <p>I could ſay more to his advantage, but that I am afraid to indulge an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in him that is too predominant; and what that is, you may perceive from the Admonition he gave me in his Letter of <hi>Feb.</hi> 9. That he and I are never like to anſwer one anothers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, ſo long as he looks for ſtrength and cloſeneſs in my Diſcourſes, or I think, to find weakneſs or looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his. Which ſhews, that he is a Man of a peculiar Temper, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd by ſuch an Air of Aſſurance as is not common. Not but that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might have treated me with as

much Contempt; but he was the Man of the World, that thought, nothing could come from him that is weak or looſe. Finding him in this condition, I thought it not unfit to give him ſuch Touches, as might make him ſenſible, that he is a Mortal Wight and of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Race: and having convinc'd him by the method I propos'd, that he was not Infallible; he now confeſſes ſome of his miſtakes.

But that his Friends may not reſent the matter too highly, when they find how they have been impos'd on by him, I can aſſure them, that in contradicting their Authors, he uſes them no worſe, than he does himſelf.

And that his Friends may not for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expect to find him any more fix'd or ſteady, he profeſſes in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle Dedicatory, that <hi>he hath nothing of fondneſs in him for any Opinions.</hi>

            <p>In the mean time, I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the way of governing Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which is agreeable to the will of God, was not to be invented or
<pb n="xxx" facs="tcp:65847:19"/>
firſt diſcover'd fifteen or ſixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after the Birth of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. I ſuppoſe a thing of ſuch uſe muſt needs have been known to the Primitive Chriſtians: And they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally believ'd, 1. That our Saviour Chriſt, who was the Founder of Church-Government, beſtow'd on his Officers ſuch Authority, as qualified them for the Adminiſtration of it. 2. That this Government was Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal from the beginning.</p>
            <p>On theſe two things I have chiefly inſiſted in this Diſcourſe, but far more copiouſly on the laſt, againſt which, I met with the greateſt oppoſition: By which oppoſition, I do not only mean, That which hath been made by my Adverſary; for I have conſiderd the utmoſt that I could find objected on That ſide. And upon the whole I am ſatisfied, that it requires no great Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to defend Epiſcopacy; and that it proceeds from the Goodneſs of the
<pb n="xxxi" facs="tcp:65847:19"/>
Cauſe, that the more Learned the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of it are, the more ready have they been to let fall ſuch things as may ſerve for the Vindication of it, and anſwer their own Objections. This was the Caſe of <hi>Blondel</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius,</hi> but more particularly of the laſt, who hath ſo many things that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour my <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that of all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Authors none has been more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to me, than <hi>Walo Meſſalinus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all the aſſiſtance I have receiv'd from him, has been only to confirm the Notions which I had before grounded on the Holy Scriptures, &amp; the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Ancients: from which I have prov'd, That Epiſcopacy was of Divine Inſtitution; and that meer Presbyters were generally ſubordinate to Superior Paſtors in the Apoſtles days, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the beſt and pureſt Ages: And if ſo, there can be no doubt concerning the ſucceeding Times, or of the Truth of what was affirm'd by the Lord <hi>Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

               </note>, that <hi>it is true in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the publick and open profeſſion, either of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery or Independency, this Nation hath been a ſtranger to each way, it's poſſible, ever ſince it hath been Chriſtian.</hi> And I will adventure to add, that the Nation may be well enough without them both, ſo long as it ſhall be Chriſtian; it being now too late to try Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of new Models, and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh ſuch Forms of Government, as in
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:65847:20"/>
the beſt Ages, were never heard of in the World.</p>
            <p>When I had enquir'd into the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Church-Government, and ſhew'd, that as it came out of the hands of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and remain'd in the Primitive Times, it was, in the Nature of it, Spiritual; and in Form, Epiſcopal; I had thoughts to diſcourſe particularly of the Exerciſe of it in the Adminiſtration of Diſcipline, and the Ordination of Miniſters; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the Extent of a Biſhops Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over many Congregations; and of the Power of the Church in a Chriſtian State; and then to make ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on that Myſtery of Iniquity that has been working amongſt Bigotted Papiſts, and others, in oppoſition to Epiſcopacy: But being interrupted by many Avocations, and not being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſwell this Volume into too great a Bulk, I have reſerv'd thoſe things, with ſome others, that may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:65847:21"/>
be conſider'd, for a ſecond Part of this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>I doubt not, but ſome will be ready to ſay, that it had been much better to have let the whole Work alone: For Now, they think, it is not a Time for Controverſies: I ſhould think ſo too, and would our Adverſaries be of the ſame mind, and not drag us into the Preſs by their Importunity. But it may ſeem a little Unreaſonable, that a Truce ſhould be maintain'd only on one ſide: And I cannot imagine, that it is a time for us to lye open to Acts of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility, and not a time to guard our ſelves from them; or that it is a time to caſt reproach on an Apoſtolical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Government, and not a time to defend it. I rather think, that it is High time to appear in vindication of it; and that we cannot be uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd Spectators of the Diligence, with which others endeavour to promote the Intereſt of their ſeveral Parties,
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:65847:21"/>
unleſs we will declare to the World, that we are not influenced by any due ſenſe of Religion.</p>
            <p>Indeed, if we are only in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church by Law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd, at certain ſeaſons, and with deſign to deſtroy it, or to ſerve a Turn againſt it, Then it is not ſtrange, if we cannot endure to hear any thing in defence of it. But what is moſt aſtoniſhing, is, that perſons ſhould be found bearing the Name of Chriſtian, and carrying on the works of Darkneſs and Treachery, of Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice and Ambition, in the moſt Solemn Acts of Worſhip, and the moſt Sacred Rites of our Holy Religion. Yet is the number of them conſiderable; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may not be fit to paſs by them without notice, I ſhall here produce ſome part of the Charge againſt them, as it is recited and addreſs'd to them by a Late Writer.</p>

One is, at which I am not a little abaſh'd, that though you, according to your declar'd Principles and Ordinary Practice, are Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts and Diſſenters; yet upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and to get into Place and Office of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor or Profit, you will and can take any manner of Teſts that have of late been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd; alſo that you can, on ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, take the Sacrament according to the Form and Way of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>though you never did before, nor perhaps will ever do the ſame again, except on the like occaſion; and although the making and forming of theſe Teſts, and the taking of the Sacrament, were intended, and done on purpoſe to keep you, and ſuch as you, out of Office; yet by theſe ways they have not been able to exclude you; and they think, that nothing, though never ſo contrary to your Principles, can be devis'd and made to keep you out, or to hold you in; but that
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:65847:22"/>
you will break all Bounds, and leap over all Hedges; ſo that they are at a loſs what to do with you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

meet with diſappointment, when you had the Papers before you, wherein I had largely handled that Subject; and whilſt you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have drawn the things from thence, which you endeavour to confute, and not from your own Invention. The truth is, this Addreſs would have been unneceſſary, had you fully related my ſenſe of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in debate between us, as you found it expreſs'd in my private Letters: But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations you have made of it are ſo very defective, that I think my ſelf obliged to communicate to publick view the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples on which I proceeded, with a Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them. And I begin with what is evident enough, That our Saviour Chriſt, who is Head of the Church, was the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Eccleſiaſtical Government, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it proceeded from a Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
               <p>The Original of this Government being known, we may the more eaſily gain a true Idea of its Nature: for that may beſt be diſcern'd, when we conſider it in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Purity, as it came out of the hands of our Lord, and was exercis'd by his Apoſtles, who were the firſt Miniſters that he ordain'd. And upon enquiry we ſhall find, That, to qualifie them for the adminiſtration of it, he gave them no Temporal Juriſdiction, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65847:29"/>
yet did communicate to them Spiritual Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: That amongſt themſelves they ſtood related as Equals, but to other Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Officers, as Superiors. And on theſe things all that I have to ſay of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will depend.</p>
               <p>An eaſie Enquiry will inform us, that our Saviour gave his Apoſtles no Temporal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction. For it is plain, that he did not ſend them to exerciſe any ſuch Dominion as was poſſeſs'd by the Kings of the Earth, or the Lords of the Gentiles.

                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:65847:31"/>This may be ſufficient to let you ſee, that the ſentiments I have of Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment intrench not on the Temporal: and that, when you tell me, <hi>The ſword knows no other edge, but what the Magiſtrate gives it,</hi> it makes nothing againſt me, who am of opinion, that the Church hath no Secular Power, but what is deriv'd from Secular Princes, and what may be limited or exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by them.</p>

               <p>The Authority that has been aſſigned to the Apoſtles and other Paſtors of the Church, is commonly called Spiritual, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly; for it is exercis'd in Spiritual matters, and relates to the affairs of another World. It does not touch or hurt the Body, or Life, or Eſtate of an Offender, but by accident. It may be aſſiſted by the Coercive Power of the Magiſtrate, but that is not eſſential to it. The adminiſtration of it is ſometimes ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more eaſie by the favour of Princes, and ſometimes more difficult by their oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but it is the ſame in it ſelf under thoſe various circumſtances.

to it under the pain of God's diſpleaſure; unleſs one will ſay, that his Precepts may be broken without danger, or that Eccleſiaſtical Government is one of the moſt precarious uſeleſs things in the World.</p>
               <p>Before I diſmiſs this Subject, it may be fit to take notice of the Attempts againſt Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Authority that have been made by a late Writer <note n="(i)" place="margin">T.

               </p>

               <p>If our Saviour had all Power, he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legate ſome part of it to his Apoſtles; and that he did ſo, appears from what has been ſaid; and it may be confirm'd from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which he made to them, that they ſhould <hi>ſit on twelve Thrones judging the twelve Tribes of Iſrael</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Another reaſon for which S. <hi>Paul</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelf under this Figure, is, that as Servants then received no wages for their work, ſo he reaped no temporal profit from his induſtry in communicating things that are Spiritual <note n="(l)" place="margin">2 Cor. 11.7. 1 Cor. 9.18, 19.</note>.

               <p>Another Argument, by which you purſue the deſign of the <hi>Leviathan</hi> in oppoſing Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Authority, is taken from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtence,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65847:36"/>
you conceive, it hath with the Civil Government, if it be not deriv'd from it. You conclude, there can be no Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction at all, unleſs it be in the Magiſtrate, or proceeds from him; becauſe, as you tell me <note n="(x)" place="margin">P. 35.</note>, <hi>in one Kingdom there can be but one ſpring or fountain of it.</hi> But if this be at all pertinent, and by Juriſdiction you do not only mean that which is Secular, your Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction makes as much againſt the Ruling Power of the Apoſtles, as of other Spiritual Paſtors. Yet is this ſome of that ſtuff which you ſo highly extol, and I ſuppoſe, that in your Epiſtle Dedicatory you had it particularly in your eye, where you ſay, that <hi>were your Idea of Church-Government re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by all others with the ſame degree of candour, as, you aſſure your ſelf, it ſhall by your Noble Friends, it would be of infinite ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to end thoſe fatal controverſies that for many Ages have perplexed, and in this laſt almoſt deſtroy'd, the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What your <hi>Noble Friends</hi> think of your performance, I cannot tell. For my own part, I am not ſurpriz'd to find you aſcribing <hi>Infinite Advantage</hi> to the Exploits of your own Pen; nor convinced, but that if your Principles about Eccleſiaſtical Polity were generally embraced, they might be of more pernicious conſequence than the Collection,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65847:36"/>
which, as <hi>Lactantius</hi> 
                  <note n="(y)" place="margin">Lactant. <hi>p. 452.</hi> Ed. Oxon.</note> informs us, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian</hi> made of the impious Reſcripts of Princes, that he might ſhew, what puniſhments ſhould be inflicted on thoſe who profeſſed themſelves Worſhippers of God.</p>
               <p>The Juſtice of this Charge will be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt from hence, that the Church cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without Government, nor Government without Authority: If therefore, as you contend, there be no Eccleſiaſtical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Authority, but what proceeds from the Magiſtrate, this would put it into the power of a <hi>Julian,</hi> to deſtroy the Church, by diſſolving that Government, and abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that Authority. And to this he might be the more inclin'd, did he believe that the Hierarchy could not be tolerated <hi>with ſafety to himſelf,</hi> or were ſo dangerous a thing as you have repreſented it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Had the Apoſtles,</hi> you ſay <note n="(z)" place="margin">P. 19.</note>, <hi>own'd any pretenſions of a deſign to erect a National (much more an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal) Hierarchy or Form of External Government in the Church, or had they done any thing to occaſion a juſt ſuſpicion of ſuch a Deſign, it would have much obſtructed the true deſign and end of their Miſſion, which was the planting and ſpreading Chriſtianity. For then Magiſtrates and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in their own defence, and for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their own inherent Prerogatives and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65847:37"/>
Rights, muſt have always oppos'd it.</hi> That is, they would have been obliged to reſtrain the Apoſtles, or oppoſe their Attempts, if they acted by other Principles, or advanced other Notions than you have embraced. And this may a little diſcover the tendency of your Letters of Church-Government.</p>
               <p>There can be no queſtion amongſt thoſe that believe the Goſpel, but that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our might have eſtabliſhed an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy.</hi> Nor can there be any doubt, but if he enjoin'd his Apoſtles to erect an <hi>external form of Church-government,</hi> it had been their duty to obey his Command. And what muſt then the Kings and Rulers of the Earth have done? If you have ſtated the Caſe right, they might lawfully have taken counſel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againſt the Lord, and againſt his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed. They might and ought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted his Deſign and Conſtitution: or in your words, <hi>They muſt in their own defence, and for the preſervation of their own inherent Prerogatives, have always oppos'd it.</hi> A paſſage which one would think you ſhould hardly reflect on, without ſomething of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
               <p>It will deſerve the ſeverer Cenſure, if it be true, that ſuch a <hi>Hierarchy</hi> as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, was indeed erected, and that by the appointment of Chriſt himſelf. And this I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65847:37"/>
take to be certain: For the Apoſtles, to whom he committed the Government of all the Church Militant, were not inviſible Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; nor were the people under their charge inviſible Subjects. They admitted not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons into the Chriſtian Society by any ſecret Rite, but by Baptiſm. Nor did they expel them from it by any hidden practice, but in a publick manner. The Faithful were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, and other Paſtors ordain'd by them, as alſo amongſt themſelves, not only in Love or Charity, as they were to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; but in that mutual relation which they had as viſible Members of the ſame Body: and as ſuch, they were obliged to meet and communicate in the Aſſemblies that were held for the putting up of ſolemn Prayers and Praiſes to Heaven for the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Euchariſt, and other external Acts of Worſhip. And whoſoever had Right to Communion in one of thoſe Aſſemblies, he had ſo in all; provided his demand of it was no way irregular. And whoſoever was expell'd for his Offences from one particular Church, he was virtually excluded from the Communion of all other Churches. He could not reſcind the Sentence againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by ſhifting of places. Nor could he be kept bound and loos'd on Earth, unleſs he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65847:38"/>
might have been abſolv'd and condemn'd in Heaven at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>After the Apoſtles days an univerſal and external Form of Church-Government was kept up, and appear'd in great vigor, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the diſturbance it receiv'd from without. You your ſelf confeſs, that <hi>the Notion of Catholick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity then obtain'd which was not underſtood,</hi> you ſay <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 30, 31.</note>, <hi>to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and ſpiritual: but to conſiſt in ſomething external, relating unto Order and Diſcipline; as being an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity that was to be maintain'd by Communicatory and other Letters, and by Orders, and (that) was intended to ſupport the Notion of but one Biſhoprick in the Church, and that every Biſhop participated of that one Biſhoprick</hi> in ſolidum. <hi>A Notion that was of great uſe to make the Diſcipline and Power the more pointed: for if but one Church, then to be caſt out of any part of the Church, was indeed to be ejected out of the whole; and if but one Biſhoprick to be participated by all the Biſhops, what was done by one, was done by all. All did cenſure, if one did. The Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made by one Biſhop out of any Church was in effect an Expulſion from all Churches; and ſo a cutting off entirely from Chriſtianity, and all Communion of Saints.</hi> Yet uſeful as you think this Notion was, and early as it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65847:38"/>
you take it to be intolerable. The Authority which you acknowledge S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> approv'd, and which was exercis'd by him and other excellent Men in his time, was, in your judgment, fit to be extirpated by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and Rulers in their own vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Becauſe, as you tell me <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 19.</note>, <hi>the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſuch a Power over their Subjects, as would not only poſſeſs an intereſt in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, but be ſtrengthned, as a Secular Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, by a cloſe connection of all the parts of it, and an exact dependance and ſubordination, would render their own precarious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How unfit this was to fall from the Pen of a Perſon that makes profeſſion of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, your ſelf may better be able to judge, if you ſuppoſe, that you had ſtood before <hi>Decius</hi> or <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> to give your advice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſtate of Chriſtians, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how they were to be treated: For had you then ſpoken your mind freely, as you have now expreſſed it, it would have been to this effect, <hi>Amongſt the Chriſtians, O Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, there hath generally obtain'd a Form of External Government, which is very uſeful indeed to them, but to you as dangerous: For it poſſeſſes an intereſt in the Conſciences of your Subjects: it is ſtrengthned by a cloſe Connection and an exact Dependance and Subordination of its parts; and being ſo, it renders your own
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65847:39"/>

               <p>I need not engage farther in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, ſince it hath been ſo lately and fully handled by others. And perhaps, Sir, you may think, that I have already dwelt too long on a Subject, in which I have no Adverſary, but the Advocates of the Papacy. But their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine being ſo inconſiſtent with that Scheme of Thoughts which you have obliged me to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65847:43"/>
publiſh, I was not willing to paſs by them without Ceremony. But now I return to you, and obſerve,</p>
               <p>Secondly, That notwithſtanding there was ſuch an Equality amongſt the Apoſtles, yet there were other Eccleſiaſtical Officers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to them. Such, I think, were the <hi>Seventy Diſciples,</hi> whom our Lord conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted <hi>in the days of his fleſh.</hi> For ſince the Apoſtles and Seventy Diſciples are thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented under different denominations: Since it is not doubted, but they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in accommodation to the twelve Princes of the Tribes, and the Seventy Elders in the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Polity; ſince none of the <hi>Seventy</hi> could be of the Order of the <hi>Twelve,</hi> without a new Election and Advancement, you need not think it ſtrange, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, as many have done before me, that they were of different Ranks, and that in this ſtate of things there was a diſparity of Miniſters.</p>
               <p>But you tell me <note n="(u)" place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 1.</note>, that <hi>if the prejudices of my Education, or of my Circumſtances, had not ſtuck too faſt to me, I might have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, that the Inſtitution of the Seventy Diſciples, was only temporary.</hi> Yet if this Diſcovery will do you any ſervice, I cannot find that your ſelf have made it. You ſay indeed, that the Seventy were ſent about a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65847:43"/>
particular buſineſs to the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that their Office ceas'd of courſe at their Return. But of this I find no grounds in the Holy Scripture. I am ſure, the Apoſtles <note n="(w)" place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> and Seventy Diſciples <note n="(x)" place="margin">Luke 10.</note> were ſent abroad and employ'd in like manner at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent times: But the firſt return'd without any loſs of their Function, and ſo might the laſt. And that they did ſo, we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think, unleſs they were degraded or depreſſed into the Rank of private men, by ſome Act of their Maſter. But to me it ſeems incredible, as it did alſo to <hi>Blondel</hi>

'Tis true, the Scriptures mention them not afterwards by the Name of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty</hi>; but if this proves, that their Office was expired, one may alſo conclude from it, that they were all dead; for there is as great a Silence about their Lives, as about their Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>It may be uſeful to contemplate that Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of Eccleſiaſtical Polity, which thoſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65847:44"/>
early times afford: yet I confeſs, they are ſomething obſcure, and that you do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly call them <hi>a Twilight between the Law and the Goſpel.</hi> And this might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd you from reflecting on me, as influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by <hi>prejudices or my circumſtances,</hi> for not acknowledging that the Office of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, which was firſt confer'd on the <hi>Twelve,</hi> as well as in your Opinion, the Commiſſion of the Seventy Diſciples, was <hi>temporary,</hi> or <hi>expired at the fartheſt after our Saviour's Reſurrection,</hi> when for this you produce no better Argument, than what implies, that a former Grant muſt neceſſarily be cancell'd, when Additions are made to it. But about this, I have no need to diſpute. We come now to another ſtate of things which is moſt clear, and in which we are infinitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. The <hi>wall of partition was broken down:</hi> And after our Lord's Aſcenſion, the multitude of Believers increaſing firſt amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and afterwards amongſt the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> the Apoſtles found it neceſſary to have ſome Aſſiſtance in their Labours, and for that purpoſe ordain'd Presbyters and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, neither of which were their Equals, but ſubject to their Authority.</p>
               <p>I will not contend, as you have done, that <hi>a Dioceſan compar'd to an Apoſtle is leſs in Authority than a Pariſh Prieſt</hi>

               <head>CHAP. III. If the Apoſtles were Biſhops, Epiſcopacy is of a Divine Original. The Objection againſt this, that the Apoſtles were Extraordinary Officers, conſider'd.</head>
               <p>IF the Apoſtles were Biſhops of the Church, and if they had Epiſcopal Authority over Presbyters, Epiſcopacy is not a mere <hi>prudential</hi> thing, as you ſuggeſt, or a <hi>defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> from the firſt Rule of Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. It was not the Invention of a <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> or a Creature of Ambition, but proceeded from our Lord himſelf, and is of a Divine Extraction.</p>
               <p>But however the Apoſtles were Biſhops, you conclude, that they were not Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents for Government in ſucceeding times, becauſe, as you tell me, they were Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Officers. And in this Aſſertion you ſtand not ſingle; for it has been often urged by others, and readily receiv'd by Perſons of different Perſuaſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:65847:45"/>Nevertheleſs, I think, we ought not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due examination, to admit a pretence, which has been made uſe of to very bad purpoſes. The greateſt Zealots for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Monarchy tell us, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> only convey'd his Power to his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; but as for the reſt of the Apoſtles, their Authority was Extraordinary and died with them <note n="(f)" rend="inter">Omnibus perſuaſum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deo hanc poteſtatem in Petro fuiſſe Ordinariam, quae tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat in Succeſſores, in aliis vero Apoſtolis fuiſſe Extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ſive delegatam, quae morte illorum extincta fuerit. <hi>Petr. de Marca in Opuſe. p. 110.</hi>

                  </note> And the ſame reaſon for which they conclude, that an end was put to the Apoſtolical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, they employ alſo to can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel the uſe of Miniſterial Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Ordination. They grant indeed, that ſuch Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was requiſite for the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel, but aſſert, that now it is become unneceſſary, ſince we are not to teach a new Doctrine with which the World is unacquainted, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the old one. But at this rate, they that are weary of any Ordinance of Chriſt, which is of poſitive Inſtitution, need but faſten on it the Name of <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> and then it muſt be of no longer continuance.</p>
               <p>I have therefore been deſirous to know what <hi>Standard</hi> you have for Extraordinaries.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65847:46"/>
And on this occaſion you have oblig'd me with an Act of pure Generoſity, for which I never ask'd. You ſend me to <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Lipſius</hi> to ſhew what were the <hi>Extraordinary Honors, Power, Magiſtrates,</hi> among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> which I knew well enough before. But what I demand is, ſome plain and certain Rule by which the things deſign'd for continuance in the Chriſtian Church may be diſtinguiſhed from thoſe, that were ſhortly to expire. And ſuch a Standard as this, I have not been able to obtain from you. I muſt therefore be content to ſtate the matter, as well as I can, without it; and for that purpoſe I ſhall here ſet down ſome things, wherein, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, we are agreed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are agreed, that they are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Officers, who are only rais'd on ſome particular or ſpecial occaſion or accident, to which their work is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited. But then it muſt be granted, that whatſoever proves not that the Work or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Apoſtles was limited to their own time, or that they might have no Succeſſors, neither doth it prove them to have been Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Officers. This I take to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt enough, and what uſe I intend to make of it, will ſhortly appear.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are agreed, That Perſons in Office may have Succeſſors in ſome things, who
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65847:46"/>
have none in others: particularly, they may have thoſe for Succeſſors in their Ordinary Work, who are not ſo in ſome of their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges. We have great reaſon for this, for otherwiſe no Succeſſion of Eccleſiaſtical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers could have been preſerv'd, and we muſt have remain'd, like the old <hi>Acephali</hi> 
                  <note n="(h)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephor. H. E.</hi> l. 18. c. 45.</note>, without Miniſters and without Sacraments.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are agreed, that the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had Succeſſors in their Ordinary work. But that we may rightly underſtand one another, and that nothing may diſturb ſo friendly an accommodation, I farther add, 1. That I take all that to be their Ordinary work, which others alſo did perform by the Authority they received from them, and which hath been continued in the Church ever ſince their days. 2. I call that their Extraordinary work, which was peculiar to them. Accordingly you may reckon amongſt Extraordinaries ſuch Circumſtances as were appropriate to themſelves or their actions: and whatſoever Privileges and Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they had, which were incommunicable, you may alſo ſet them down in your Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of Extraordinaries, for they were Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, and died with them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We are agreed, that to teach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the People in the Duties and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion, to adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65847:47"/>
to conſtitute Guides, and to exerciſe the Diſcipline and Government of the Church, was the Apoſtles Ordinary work. This is what you your ſelf aſſign unto them as ſuch in the words of Dr. <hi>Cave,</hi> which I cannot but approve: But you muſt put a ſtrange Interpretation on them, if they do not overthrow that for which you produced them. For if, as you ſay well after that Excellent Author, it did belong to the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and perpetual part of the Apoſtles work, <hi>to exerciſe the Diſcipline and Government of the Church:</hi> that muſt be either ſuch a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, or ſuch a Government as they did not exerciſe, or ſuch as they did: If you ſay the firſt of theſe, you ſuppoſe that to have been their Ordinary work, which was not their work at all: If you ſay the laſt, then it will follow, that ſuch Government as they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd, and which was Prelatical, ought to be continued to the end of the World.</p>
               <p>I might now juſtly neglect all your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn from the number of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, from their ſeeing Chriſt, and the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they receiv'd immediately from him; from their being the Foundation of the Church, and the Power they had to work Miracles; from the Extent of their Charge, and their unſetled condition, by which you would prove, that they are Extraordinary
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65847:47"/>
Officers: for you may furniſh your ſelf with a Reply to them, from the Articles of our Agreement. But in hopes to give farther light to what has been ſaid before, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to attend your Motions, and you are like to find me liberal enough in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions.</p>
               <p n="1">I. I grant, that originally there were but twelve Apoſtles; and I doubt not, but, as S. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> intimates <note n="(i)" place="margin">—<gap reason="foreign">

On the contrary I ſhall prove in another place, that it was actually communicated to others: yet I deny not, but the Name of the <hi>Twelve</hi> was continued: for as it was aſſign'd to the Apoſtles <note n="(k)" place="margin">Joh. 20.24. 1 Cor. 15.5.</note> with regard to their firſt Inſtitution, when <hi>Judas</hi> was fall'n, and there remain'd only Eleven; ſo it was alſo when many more were admitted into the Sacred College <note n="(l)" place="margin">Rev. 21.14.</note>. And thus ſays <hi>Peter du Moulin</hi>

The Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Decapolis</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis</hi> kept up their Names, when ſome of their old Cities were deſtroy'd, or when new ones were built within their Precincts: and <hi>Neapolis</hi> (which ſignifies a New City) is ſtill ſo call'd notwithſtanding its great Antiquity.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:65847:48"/>II. I grant, That the firſt Apoſtles ſaw the Lord: but this was no part of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: only it made them fit to be the firſt Witneſſes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. Becauſe, ſays <hi>Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> 
                  <note n="(o)" rend="inter">Quia Apoſtoli in orbem terrarum mittendi forent ad omnium gentium informatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, non auribus tantùm ſed &amp; oculis praedicandam fidem cape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re debebant, ut quod firmiùs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciſſent conſtantius edocerent.</note>, they were to be ſent into the World for the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all Nations, it was requiſite they ſhould receive the Faith, they were to preach, not only with their ears, but with their eys, that what they had more firmly learned they might more conſtantly teach. But we cannot infer from hence, that none might ſucceed them in teaching and governing. Their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with Chriſt in the Fleſh was a great Privilege, to which at this time none can juſtly pretend: But what qualified them for the Miſſion, by which they were enabled to conſtitute ſubordinate Officers, did not hinder them certainly from appointing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to preſide over them, as themſelves had done.</p>
               <p n="3">III. I grant, That the Apoſtles had their Commiſſion immediately from our Saviour. But notwithſtanding this Privilege, others might as well ſucceed them in the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they had, to govern the Churches,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65847:48"/>
as Princes might ſit on the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> who were not advanced to it in a manner ſo Extraordinary, by the particular Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and expreſs Declaration of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, as himſelf had been. <hi>Noah</hi> &amp; his Sons receiv'd <hi>Power,</hi> by an expreſs Revelation <note n="(p)" place="margin">Gen. 9.</note>, <hi>over the beaſts of the earth, and over the fowl of the air, over every thing that moved upon the earth, and over the fiſhes of the ſea,</hi> and liberty <hi>to eat of every living thing as of the green herb.</hi> Yet they tranſmitted that Power and Liberty to their Poſterity, who have not ſuch an intercourſe with Heaven, as themſelves had. Thus the firſt Apoſtles, who were ſent immediately by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, might convey their Authority to others, who had not that advantage. And 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that their Office was actually dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to <hi>Matthias,</hi> to whom our Lord did not immediately ſpeak the words of their Commiſſion.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. I grant, That the Apoſtles were in ſome ſenſe the Foundation on which the Chriſtian Church was built: for ſo we learn from S. <hi>Paul, Eph.</hi> 2.20. But this does not demonſtrate, that they were an Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary part of the Building. Some think they were ſaid to be the Foundation, becauſe they firſt publiſhed the Goſpel.

And from hence you have infer'd, that none can have a Title to the Authority of Apoſtles, who cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe Signs and Credentials. And this, I confeſs, is very ſpecious, but that is all, as may partly appear from what has been ſaid already, and will be more manifeſt, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention'd, with thoſe of our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.17, 18.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65847:51"/>
this Conſequence would be as good as the former. But if it be abſurd, the other is ſo too.</p>
               <p>Againſt this your Exception is, That the Signs our Saviour ſpeaks of, did not follow all, but only ſome that believed: That Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were not called the Signs of Believers, but that they were ſuch Marks and Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteriſtical Notes of the Apoſtles, that by them S. <hi>Paul</hi> prov'd himſelf to be one of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. To which I reply,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That you ſuppoſe a real difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Expreſſion of Chriſt, and that of the Apoſtle, whereas there is none. For I appeal to any Perſon that is a competent Judge of the ſenſe of words, whether, <hi>theſe ſigns ſhall follow or attend a Believer,</hi> and <hi>theſe ſhall be the ſigns of a Believer,</hi> are not Propoſitions of the ſame import. Certainly had S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, the Signs which follow an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle have been wrought among you, he had ſaid as much as we find in his own words, <hi>the ſigns of an Apoſtle were wrought among you.</hi> If therefore the Promiſe of Chriſt extends not to all the Faithful, but ſome may believe who cannot ſhew the Signs that once fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Believers; ſo may ſome have ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over other Eccleſiaſtical Officers, as the firſt Apoſtles exercis'd, who cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thoſe things which were the Signs of thoſe Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:65847:51"/>2. If Miracles, as ſuch, were a Note of the Apoſtolical Office, if they were that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar or characteriſtical Mark, by which S. <hi>Paul</hi> was known and demonſtrated to be an Apoſtle; then all that had that Mark, that is, all that wrought Miracles, were alſo Apoſtles; and conſequently the number of the Apoſtles muſt be vaſtly increas'd by the acceſſion of many Chriſtians, who did bear no Office in the Church at all. Yet I deny not, but Miracles in connexion with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, were Signs or Marks both of the Apoſtles and other Chriſtians. They were Signs of the Apoſtles, as they confirm'd that Authority they exercis'd, and which they declar'd they had receiv'd from Chriſt. They were Signs of Believers, as atteſting the Truth of what they profeſſed. They were the Signs of thoſe that had the Power of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, but not ſuch Signs, as exclude all others from their Order and Rank that have them not.</p>
               <p>For Illuſtration of this, I further add, that ſomething may be fit and neceſſary for the firſt Inſtitution of an Order, which is not ſo for the Continuance of it. For example, the Seventy Elders mention'd, <hi>Num.</hi> 11. were conſtituted Judges by the immediate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Heaven: and <hi>the Lord came down in a cloud, and took of the Spirit that was
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65847:52"/>
upon Moſes, and gave it to them, and they propheſied,</hi> v. 25. This Spirit was no more Accidental to them, than other Miraculous Gifts were to the Apoſtles; for it was made neceſſary by the appointment of God, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17. and it was ſuch a Characteriſtical Mark of their being choſen by him, that <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad</hi> and <hi>Medad,</hi> who remain'd in the Camp, were diſtinguiſhed by it, and known to be of their number, <hi>v.</hi> 26. But it was only a Mark of the firſt Elders. None that came after them were advanced to that Dignity, and confirm'd in it with ſuch Solemnity.

               <p>The Advancement of <hi>Aaron</hi> to his Office was Extraordinary, and ſo were his Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; yet others ſucceeded him in that Office who were not admitted into it, nor eſtabliſhed in it in a manner ſo miraculous and ſtupendous, as their Great Anceſtor had been. They reſided at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he had ſojourn'd in the Wilderneſs. They had not their Garments made by inſpired Workmen, as his were: nor could they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the mighty Acts, which he did: yet were they as certainly High-Prieſts as he was, notwithſtanding the want of his Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:65847:52"/>Formerly you thought, that if an Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Miſſion and Extraordinary Power do not conſtitute Extraordinary Officers, then there never could be any ſuch in the Church of God. But upon better information, you cannot but acknowledge, that <hi>Aaron</hi> had ſuch a Miſſion and ſuch Power, and yet was ſucceeded by ſome that had neither. Only, you tell me, that theſe Extraordinary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of <hi>Aaron</hi> were contingent, and that he had them, not as he was High-Prieſt, but by a particular and expreſs Revelation; nor could his Authority, when he was oppos'd by <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, have been preſerv'd but by a Miracle <note n="(z)" place="margin">Num. 16.</note>. Afterwards he could not have been continued High-Prieſt, had he not been diſtinguiſhed by the bloſſoming of his Rod: for that by the appointment of God, became a neceſſary Mark, by which the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might be known whom the Lord had choſen to that Dignity <note n="(a)" place="margin">Num. 17.5.</note>, and without which, none might have own'd him under the Character he had born.

                  </note>, yet it is early enough to ſhew, that there were many High-Prieſts who had not that <hi>LIGHT</hi> and <hi>PERFECTION</hi> which diſtinguiſhed their Predeceſſors, and for which they were ſo eminent and uſeful to their Nation.</p>
               <p>The Deacons, at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where they were firſt appointed, were Originally ſeven; and theſe might not have been choſen and conſtituted, had they not been Men full of the Holy Ghoſt <note n="(e)" place="margin">Acts 6.3.</note>. <hi>Stephen</hi> who was one of them, was full of Faith and Power, and did great Wonders and Miracles <note n="(f)" place="margin">Acts 6.8.</note>. And <hi>Philip</hi> alſo caſt out unclean Spirits, and healed thoſe that were taken with Palſies, and thoſe that were Lame <note n="(g)" place="margin">Acts 8.7.</note>: So that <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus,</hi> who ſaw the mighty Works which he did, was filled with Wonder and Aſtoniſhment, like the Inchanters of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when they beheld the Finger of God. But neither was it afterwards always requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, that there ſhould be juſt ſeven Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, however ſome religiouſly adher'd to that number; nor was it neceſſary, that they ſhould always be adorn'd with Gifts that were Extraordinary and Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65847:53"/>
for otherwiſe, when Miracles ceas'd their Office muſt have ceas'd with them.</p>
               <p>The Circumſtances of the firſt Presbyters were alſo Extraordinary. They were quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for their Ordination with Extraordinary Gifts, and Directions were given about it by Extraordinary Indications. They could pray with the Spirit, and preach by Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: They could ſpeak Languages which they had never learn'd, and perform other things as Miraculous. Yet when all thoſe Extraordinaries ceas'd, the Order and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Presbyters did not ſo, but ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd, and ought to remain to the end of the World.</p>
               <p>From theſe Inſtances, it is manifeſt, that ſome things might be requiſite for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of an Office, and for ſome that were veſted with it; a repetition of which, is not always neceſſary for its preſervation; nor for all that are advanced to it. However therefore, the Apoſtles had ſome Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, to which none at this time have any juſt pretence, however it was very fit, that they that were the firſt Planters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſhould be able to recommend their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which was then new, to the World, with Miracles, which we may call the Seals of that Commiſſion which they receiv'd from Chriſt: yet the Authority they had,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65847:54"/>
as Supreme Viſible Paſtors of the Church, might deſcend to others, who have no need of new Seals or Credentials for what may be ſufficiently confirm'd by the ſame.</p>
               <p>Let us now ſuppoſe, if you pleaſe, that the Apoſtles did more Miracles than any others; or that the working of ſome, was peculiar to them; yet if Miracles, as ſuch, hinder not a Succeſſion to them, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and quality of their Miracles cannot do it without ſome declaration, that they were intended for that purpoſe. They may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeem to concur with other things, in ſignifying the pleaſure of the Almighty to preſerve that Office or Order which he ſo highly approv'd, and which he had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in ſo wonderful a manner.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. I grant, that the Charge of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles was of great extent: yet this hinders not, but that they might have Succeſſors in their Office or Authority. They had a large Sphere of Action, when they were ſent to diſciple all Nations: But then no Apoſtle had ſole Commiſſion to do this: Neither were the Apoſtles wont to act as in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council by Majority of Voices, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers'd themſelves, that they might better propagate the Doctrine of Chriſt: They did not all travel together into the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;

But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that ſome of them were more eſpecially engaged to plant Chriſtianity amongſt the Gentiles, ſome amongſt thoſe of the Circumciſion: Some in this Nation, and ſome in that. No ſingle Perſon had the whole work of preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel committed ſolely to him. For, as there ought to be no Oecumenical Biſhop, ſo there was no Oecumenical Apoſtle, who had Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over the reſt. It is alſo manifeſt, that all the Biſhops in the ſecond and other Centuries, had Power to govern all the Churches that were planted by all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and to propagate Chriſtianity far and near, ſo that the Charge of both in general, was of equal extent. And if the multitude of Paſtors, as well as of other Chriſtians, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, particular Biſhops were concluded within a narrower compaſs than the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had been, ſuch Diſproportion of Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes,

               <p>To conclude: As the Office of Presbyters was the ſame, when they were ſeverally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to diſtinct Congregations, as it was when they had the Care or Government in common of many Congregations under the Preſidence of the Biſhop <note n="(h)" place="margin">

               <head>CHAP. V. The Apoſtolate differs not in ſubſtance from the Office of a Biſhop. It was deſign'd for continuance.</head>
               <p>I Have conſider'd the Arguments by which you would demonſtrate, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were Extraordinary Officers, and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the laſt of them which I mention'd, I proceeded farther than was neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was willing to lay ſome things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that relate to the ſame ſubject. It was my buſineſs to ſhew, that a ſetled Reſidence in a Place, was conſiſtent with the Office of an Apoſtle; and this I have not only done, but alſo prov'd, that S. <hi>James</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that <hi>Simeon</hi> was his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor: and if ſo, this does not only anſwer whatever you produce for your Opinion, but is a direct Argument for Epiſcopacy. It alſo ſhews, that the Apoſtolate differs not in ſubſtance from Epiſcopacy, and that it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for continuance. A Truth which I ſhall
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65847:67"/>
confirm, 1. From the Nature of that Office or Authority, which was confer'd on the Apoſtles. 2. From the Neceſſity of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of ſome things which depend on a Succeſſion to them. 3. From the Promiſe which was annexed to their Commiſſion. 4. From the Actual Communication of their Office to others, and the Preſervation of it after their Deceaſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This Office or Authority which was of Divine Inſtitution, was never abrogated by any Divine Precept: It was neither appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the Apoſtles, nor can Time ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it uſeleſs or unfit: It is therefore ſuch as ought to be preſerv'd in all Ages.</p>
               <p>We may well think, that they who were converſant with Chriſt himſelf, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd their Commiſſion immediately from him, have afforded us the beſt Pattern of Government that ever was; and it ſeems very improbable, that our Lord ſhould ſhew us in their example, the moſt excellent way of managing Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, and put us under an obligation to reject it, without telling us ſo: or, that ſuch a diſparity of Officers, as had his approbation, but never was oppos'd by him, ſhould now become Antichriſtian.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:65847:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>They ſay, that Empires are beſt preſerv'd by ſuch means as they were founded, and if the Apoſtles thought a diſparity of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers neceſſary, when they were employ'd in converting the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; I think 'tis ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for the Government of them now that they are converted: for their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, did prepare them for more Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: it obliged them to an attendance at Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Aſſemblies: it made them ſubject to Diſcipline, who were not ſo before. And when the Work increaſes, I think the Labourers ought not to be diminiſhed, nor their Ranks broken.</p>
               <p>We may rather ſuppoſe, that when whole Kingdoms embraced the Chriſtian Faith, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders would be increas'd. And when the firſt Apoſtles were departed, who could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey Diſeaſes and Death in their Cenſures; whenever that Miraculous Power ceas'd, it was requiſite that ſome ſhould retain all the Authority they had, which was communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, that by the Dignity of their Office they might keep up a Reverence of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and preſerve the Peace and Unity of the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a Neceſſity of the Continuation of ſome things which might depend on a Succeſſion to the Apoſtles, and cannot be preſerv'd without it. Amongſt them, I reckon
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65847:68"/>
the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments; and the reaſon of it will be manifeſt, when I have examin'd, by what Right it is that you aſſign that Adminiſtration to Presbyters, as a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding part of their Work. I therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the firſt place, From whence it is that they have Right to Baptize? If it be from any Declaration that is made to them in Scripture, let it be ſhew'd; if from any Command, let it be produc'd: if from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, I pray inform me, where any of their Order did Baptize. I think upon enquiry it will be found, that none in Scripture are ſaid to Baptize, but ſuch as you call Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Officers: and if they were ſo, as many of their Actions as were peculiar to them may not be drawn into precedent: It follows therefore from your Principles, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Baptiſm muſt be laid aſide, or elſe the Laity may confer it, and they that have taken it out of their hands, have done it in their wrong, and that, ever ſince the days of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Lord's Supper, you are like to be as much or more at a loſs; for you tell me, that theſe words, <hi>Do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me,</hi> were ſaid to the Apoſtles, not as they were Miniſters, but as Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants (you mean private Chriſtians.) And if ſo, I would demand, what grounds you
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65847:69"/>
have from Scripture, for aſſigning to any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Officers the Adminiſtration of this Sacrament, or how, with Conſiſtence to your own Principles, you can free them from Uſurpation.</p>
               <p>The reaſon for which you think thoſe words of Chriſt were not ſaid to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles as Miniſters, but as private Chriſtians, is, that otherwiſe <hi>there is no Canon of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion for the Common People or Laity:</hi> at which, I ſuppoſe, ſome of them, who talk much of Religion, would not be offended. But if there be nothing elſe, on which their Right to the Communion is founded, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any injury to them, this matter may be thus adjuſted. The Apoſtles as receiving the Communion might be the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Faithful, and of Miniſters only, in receiving the Command of Chriſt, to do as he had ſhew'd them; that is, to bleſs and give to others the Sacramental Elements of Bread and Wine. And ſuch I affirm they were; and ſuch you muſt acknowledge them to have been, unleſs you will ſay, that the Adminiſtration of the Euchariſt by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Church hath no foundation in the Holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>I ſee no way to avoid the difficulties with which you are intangled, unleſs it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the Apoſtles receiv'd Commiſſion
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65847:69"/>
to adminiſter both the Sacraments for not only themſelves, but others alſo. And ſince a Right to that Commiſſion cannot be convey'd but by Ordination; and there can be no Power of Ordination, unleſs it be deriv'd from the Apoſtles: from hence I gather, that in this, which was a principal part of their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as well as in that of conferring Baptiſm, and celebrating the Euchariſt, they ought to have Succeſſors in all Ages.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When our Lord, before his Aſcenſion, gave his Commiſſion to the Apoſtles, he left them an aſſurance of his Preſence with them in theſe words, <hi>Lo I am with you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, even unto the end of the world,</hi> Matth. 28.20. And from hence it appears, that it is agreeable to our Saviour's intention, that they ſhould have Succeſſors: <note n="(u)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Jus Divin. Miniſt. Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.</hi> par. 1. p. 26, 27.</note> for as the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly</hi> of Divines ſay well, <hi>This promiſe cannot be confin'd to their perſons, who did not live to the end of the world, but reacheth all Ages, and ſtrongly argueth that the Office of the Miniſtry ſhall continue till the ſecond coming of Chriſt:</hi> And if ſo, let us ſee whether the words be capable of ſuch a Paraphraſe as this; <hi>Hereafter there ſhall be another ſort of Miniſters, far inferior to you, not only in perſonal Gifts or inward and miraculous Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, but in Authority; and theſe I will protect to the end of the world; but you and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65847:70"/>
your Function muſt ſhortly be extinct.</hi> Now this is ſuch an odd kind of Interpretation, as I can by no means approve. But ſince the Promiſe was made immediately to the Apoſtles, one would think, that it had a more eſpecial regard to the preſervation of their Order, if it was alſo meant of any others.</p>
               <p>Againſt this, your exception is, that by <hi>the End of the World,</hi> ſome underſtand the Conſummation of the <hi>Moſaical Seculum,</hi> and think they have good reaſon for ſo doing, by comparing <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. with 24.3, 14. But that expreſſion is only uſed in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of thoſe Verſes of <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. where the Diſciples ſaid to our Saviour, <hi>What ſhall be the ſign of thy coming, and of the End of the World?</hi> And here they ſeem to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſuch an End, as ſhould be put to the World, at our Lord's perſonal and glorious Appearance; and not that earlier Period of his coming in a Figure only, to take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation: for this could hardly agree with the <hi>Idea</hi> they had of that ſtate of things, about which they made their enquiry. However it be, thrice <note n="(w)" place="margin">Matth. 13.39, 40, 49.</note> do we meet with this Phraſe in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter of the ſame Evangeliſt, and as often it ſignifies the Conſummation of all things at the day of Judgment: For then it
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65847:70"/>
is, that <hi>the Son will ſend forth his Angels to gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity, and caſt them in the furnace of fire.</hi> And then <hi>ſhall the Righteous ſhine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father</hi>; that is, <hi>when he ſhall deliver up the Kingdom to the Father</hi>; for then, ſays the Apoſtle, <note n="(x)" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.24.</note> 
                  <hi>cometh the end.</hi> But if it be ſaid, that the Predictions I have mention'd from <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. import no more, than the Calamities that fell on the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the refreſhment that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans receiv'd above ſixteen hundred years ago; after this rate of expounding Scripture, one may evacuate the cleareſt Prophecies of the future and glorious appearance of our Lord, to render to every one according to his deeds.</p>
               <p>The Expoſition which you defend, is not free from other inconveniences: For it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that the continuance of Chriſt with his Apoſtles, muſt be commenſurate with the time of his long-ſufferance towards his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal enemies: and then, however he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready freed them from the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Yoke, and intended to diſperſe them into remote Regions, where they would be little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd with the Political Affairs and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Judea:</hi> yet wherever they were, they could have no aſſurance of the preſence
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65847:71"/>
of our Lord with them, any longer than he preſerv'd his Crucifiers, and ſo their hopes muſt live and dye with his Murderers.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, all the Apoſtles did not live till <hi>Titus</hi> executed on the <hi>Jews</hi> a moſt juſt Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. But then I would demand of you, that limit the Advantage of our Saviour's Promiſe to the Perſons of the Apoſtles, and underſtand by it, that extraordinary Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance he gave them in the diſcharge of their Office, how he continued with them that were deceas'd: and whether their duſt and aſhes, or their reliques, perform'd the Work and Signs of Apoſtles till that Period, which you call the end of the <hi>Moſaical Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum?</hi> But ſome lived after that time, and I would be inform'd, whether they were then abandon'd by our Lord? If ſo, what affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting thoughts muſt it coſt S. <hi>John,</hi> who liv'd above thirty years after the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when his Maſter, that lov'd him ſo well all that while, deſerted him, or leſt him without his uſual Conſolation. But this inconvenience you think <note n="(y)" place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 51.</note>, may be avoided, by comparing <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. with <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.25. where we are inform'd, <hi>that</hi> Joſeph <hi>knew not</hi> Mary, <hi>till ſhe had brought forth her firſt born Son. For as the meaning is not, that he knew her afterwards, ſo when our Saviour ſays, that he would be with his
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65847:71"/>
Apoſtles to the end of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>World, this ſignifies indeed, that he would be with them ſo long; but does not imply, that he would be with them no longer.</hi> That is, you had fixed a Period of Chriſt's Preſence, but finding your ſelf preſſed with the conſequence of it, you declare, that there was no Period of it at all. And his declaring, that he would be with them to the End of the World, was as if he had ſaid, he would be with them after the End of the World indefinitely.</p>
               <p>I do not ſee how that inſtance from <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.25. ſupports this Expoſition. For neither doth this ſhew how our Saviour could be ſaid to be with thoſe that were deceas'd before the end of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Polity: that is, how he aſſiſted them in the work of their Apoſtleſhip, when that work was over, and they were entred into their reſt: nor yet does it reach the Caſe of thoſe that ſurviv'd. For however it is enough for us to know, that the Mother of our Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd a Virgin till the time of his Birth; yet it was not enough for them to know, that he would be with them till the <hi>Jews</hi> were deſtroy'd. They had as much need of Comfort and Encouragement from his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſe afterwards, as they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yet of this they muſt have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived, had the End of the World, beyond
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65847:72"/>
which that Promiſe was not extended, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Ruine of their Nation.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, theſe words of <hi>Grotius</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. ſeem highly rational. From hence, ſays he <note n="(z)" rend="inter">Hinc manifeſtiſſimè apparet voluiſſe Chriſtum ut A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolis aliis, illi rurſum aliis viris fidis, munus illud magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterii commendarent.

For ſince this Promiſe extends it ſelf to the Conſummation of the World, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles could not live ſo long; Chriſt is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be thought to have ſpoken to their Succeſſors in that Office. And this, Sir, is the Teſtimony of that Learned Man, <hi>who for the reputation he hath juſtly gain'd in the World of great knowledge, and exact Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm may ſignifie ſomething with you,</hi> to uſe your own words: and if he was not much miſtaken, this Text of Scripture, by which you would prove that the Apoſtles were Extraordinary Officers, overthrows what you deſign by it, and ſuppoſes that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ought to have Succeſſors till the coming of our Lord to Judgment.</p>

For whatever extraordinary Qualifications and peculiar Privileges the firſt Apoſtles had, it will be manifeſt, that the Authority they had as Supreme Governours of the Church, was none of them.

               <head>CHAP. VII. Apoſtolical Authority was communicated to <hi>Timothy</hi>: who was Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE have ſeen that the Name and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Apoſtles was confer'd on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that were not of the <hi>Twelve.</hi> I come now to ſhew, that there were others of the ſame Order, or to whom the ſame Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was convey'd, who are not mention'd in Scripture under the denomination of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. Such are <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and the <hi>Angels</hi> of the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Churches, to which more may be added; but on theſe I chiefly inſiſt.</p>
               <p>That Apoſtolical or Epiſcopal Authority was communicated to <hi>Timothy</hi> may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from hence, that he had full Power of Ordination. This appears from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that was given him <note n="(x)" place="margin">1 Tim. 5.22.</note>, <hi>to lay hands ſuddenly on no man.</hi> That is, not to admit any into a Sacred Function, without a due examination. For ſo I interpret the words
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65847:80"/>
with <hi>Theodoret</hi>

                     <hi>Phot. Ep.</hi> 54. p. 109.</note>, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, both Ancient and Modern Writers. Some Learned Men, I know, put another ſenſe on them, and by <hi>laying on of hands,</hi> underſtand the Abſolution of Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures: But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find in Scripture, that the Reconciliation of Penitents to the Peace of the Church was perform'd by that Ceremony.</p>
               <p>The Context leads us to the Expoſition I have given: For in the precedent Verſes the Apoſtle treats of Spiritual Officers. He ſpeaks of the <hi>double honour</hi> or maintenance, which is due to thoſe that rule well, and ſhews the reaſon of it. He ſpeaks of the Complaints againſt others that are criminal, and of the publick Reproof and Cenſure of them. And to prevent the Scandal that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from the Miſcarriages of ſuch, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects <hi>Timothy to lay hands ſuddenly on no man:</hi> not to be too haſty in Ordaining of any, leſt by his Precipitance, he ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unworthy Perſons into the Miniſtry, and <hi>partake with them in their ſins.</hi> And from hence we may learn, what high truſt was impos'd in him. For in the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Care, the Admiſſion of Perſons into Eccleſiaſtical Offices, was wholly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, and he was the ſole Judge of their Qualifications.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:65847:81"/>There were many Presbyters where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, yet were they not joyn'd in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion with him; and that they might not act as his Equals in the Adminiſtration of the Government, is manifeſt from hence, that it is not ſaid by S. <hi>Paul</hi> to any of them, Againſt my Work-fellow whom I left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, receive not an Accuſation; but it was ſaid to him, <hi>Againſt an Elder receive not an accuſation, but before two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.19. Which words plainly import the Office of a Judge. For, as<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Morin. de Ordinat. Par.</hi> 3. <hi>Exerc.</hi> 3. c. 3. p. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi> obſerves, from hence we may gather, that three things belong'd to <hi>Timothy,</hi> in which the Office of a Judge amongſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> was contain'd. He might grant an Action to thoſe that petition'd for it, and preſcribe the Form of it: He might ſit upon examination of Matters in debate, and hear them pleaded; and he might determine them, by paſſing Sentence. Presbyters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as well as others, being liable to his Sentence were ſubject to his Authority. And this the Apoſtle intimates, where he adjures him to be impartial in his proceedings with them, and not to be warpt by his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or reſpect of perſons, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21.</p>
               <p>We find not that any offending Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were left in a condition to put in Exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions againſt his Authority; or that, if
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65847:81"/>
they were rebuk'd by him <hi>before all,</hi> they might make the following Reply, <hi>We believe our Doctrine to be true, or know our Actions juſt; but if not, we are not accountable to you for them: for you, Sir, and we ſtand upon the ſame level: if therefore you would make us ſubject to your Cenſures, you take too much upon you, and uſurp a Power to which you have no Right.</hi> Yet if ſome Modern Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had prevail'd and were well grounded, that Anſwer they might have given him, or they might have appeal'd from him, to their own Colleagues in the Conſiſtory, or to their own private Congregations. But that no ſuch thing could be done, is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would have rendred the Apoſtles Inſtructions uſeleſs and impertinent.</p>
               <p>He had not only Power to correct and puniſh Miſcarriages: He was alſo oblig'd to give ſuitable encouragement to the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>be accounted worthy of double honour, eſpecially they that labour in the word and doctrine,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.17. I know that the meaning of theſe words has been mightily controverted by diſſenting Parties, and that they have been made a foundation by ſome for the eſtabliſhment of ſuch a ſort of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as before the laſt Age were never heard of in the Chriſtian World: But though they
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65847:82"/>
yield no ſuch Conſequence as theſe men would draw from them, yet in my opinion, they may give ſome light to the matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, and afford us a Pattern of what was practis'd in the Primitive times. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. All Presbyters were not then uſually employ'd in <hi>labouring in the Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>; as will be manifeſt to any that will but conſult what Mr. <hi>Le Moyne</hi> 
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">Obſervat. ad Ep. Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp. <hi>p. 35, 36.</hi>
                  </note> has written on this Subject, and the Authorities mention'd by him. But there was no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear, that the people ſhould want In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, when the Biſhop, who preach'd himſelf, had many Presbyters under him, and employ'd ſome in teaching, ſome in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring the Sacraments, ſome in viſiting the Sick, and comforting the Weak and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, ſome in enquiring into Scandals, and aſſiſting in the Affairs of Government. And the Inconveniencies that might ariſe from Emulation, if every one had been Judge in his own Cauſe, were beſt avoided by the Authority of the Biſhop who aſſign'd Work and Encouragement to them ſuitable to their ſeveral Capacities.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the Primitive Times the Biſhop was intruſted with the Goods of the Church <note n="(c)" place="margin">Vid. Canon. Apoſt. <hi>38.</hi> &amp; <hi>41.</hi> Cyprian. Ep. <hi>5. p. 10.</hi> Edit. Oxon.</note>, and out of the Contributions that were made
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65847:82"/>
to him, he appointed ſubordinate Officers to ſupply the Wants of private Chriſtians. He was alſo obliged to make proviſion out of the ſame for his Clergy. And for this, <hi>Timothy</hi> was a Precedent, whoſe duty it was, to take care that the Labourer ſhould have his Reward, and that the Elders, who rul'd well, ſhould receive double honour, or a double portion out of the Publick Stock. They depended on him therefore for their maintenance, as well as in the exerciſe of their Function.</p>
               <p>But that the force of what I have argued from the Pre-eminence and Power of <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> may the better appear, I am deſirous, his Caſe may be compar'd with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inſtance, in which we are alike diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed. <hi>Nicocles</hi> was advis'd by <hi>Iſocrates</hi> 
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">

Baſil.</hi> 1587</note> to confer Honors on the moſt deſerving, and to commit the management of Affairs to Men of worth, as knowing, that the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of thoſe that were in ſuch a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would be imputed to him. He was alſo advis'd to take cognizance of Complaints, and to judge indifferently, according to the Merits of the Cauſe between contending Parties. And this was enough to ſatisfie any one that had never heard the Name of <hi>Nicocles,</hi> and knew nothing of his Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, that he had the Adminiſtration of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65847:83"/>
and that the perſons about whom he receiv'd this counſel, were his Subjects. In like manner, when we reflect on the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection that was given to <hi>Timothy</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Ordination of Miniſters, and the danger he incurr'd, if he did not obſerve it; when we alſo conſider how he was requir'd to proceed, if an Action were brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him againſt a Presbyter, and what Care he was oblig'd to take of the Elders that ruled well, we have reaſon to conclude, that they were not his Equals, but under his Inſpection and Authority.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Timothy</hi> had Epiſcopal Authority, is manifeſt, I think, from what has been ſaid: and that he was Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> appears from hence, that there he reſided <note n="(e)" place="margin">1 Tim. 1.3.</note>, that he might exerciſe his Apoſtolical Power in ſuch manner as we have ſeen, and that he might <hi>charge ſome,</hi> who were perſons doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that had Right to preach the Goſpel, <hi>to teach no other Doctrine.

               <p>But <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> you ſay, <hi>were Co-founders of Churches with the Apoſtle</hi> Paul, <hi>and from hence aroſe their Viſitorial Power, which conſequently was peculiar and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.</hi> That is, you have aſſum'd a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of beſtowing on perſons what Titles you pleaſe, and then you draw from them ſuch Inferences as you think expedient.

                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 45.</note>.</p>
               <p>A Church as we have ſeen had been foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at <hi>Epheſus</hi> ſeveral years before the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of it was committed to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and how he could be a <hi>Co-founder,</hi> I do not underſtand. I ſuppoſe, he neither laid the Old Foundation over again, nor raz'd it, that he might lay another.</p>
               <p>If you call him a Co-founder of that Church, only becauſe by his preaching he increas'd the number of Believers; the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters that were before his coming, were for the ſame reaſon <hi>Co-founders</hi> alſo: for

doubtleſs they were employ'd in the ſame work: But that they and others of the ſame Rank, by converting Infidels, and adding them to the Church, ſtarted up into an higher Order, than that of which they were before, is what, I think, was never yet heard of in the Chriſtian World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> laid the Foundation of a Church at <hi>Samaria</hi> 
                  <note n="(f)" place="margin">Acts 8.</note>; but by doing this, he gained no new Juriſdiction; he did not obtain by it the Power of Impoſition of Hands which the Apoſtles had: nor any Authority over Presbyters, but remain'd a Deacon as he was before.</p>

               <p>Let us now ſuppoſe, that <hi>Timothy</hi> had founded the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> it doth not follow, as we have ſeen, that his Authority was Extraordinary. Yet in your opinion he could not be a Biſhop, unleſs his Office had <hi>related to a Church already planted,</hi> for that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65847:87"/>
you make the condition of Epiſcopal Charge. But how groundleſs this Conceit is, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from what has been ſaid, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, from that known Paſſage of <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi>

                     <hi>Clem. Ep.</hi> p. 42.</note>, where he ſays expreſly that the <hi>Apoſtles ordain'd ſome to be Biſhops of thoſe that afterwards ſhould believe.</hi> What Biſhops he ſpeaks of, is not here the Queſtion. They were ſuch as you approve, and they were conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Biſhops of thoſe, who, at that time, were Unbelievers. But that Biſhops, who have Commiſſion to preach the Goſpel, have Power to preach it to Believers only: or if they preach it to Infidels, that for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they ſhould either forfeit their former Office, or need another, is ſo abſurd, that to mention it, is a ſufficient Confutation of it.</p>
               <p>Another of the Objections, which you advance againſt the Epiſcopacy of <hi>Timothy,</hi> is, that <hi>he is not ſtyled a Biſhop in Scripture</hi> 
                  <note n="(k)" place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 26.</note>. On this Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> alſo inſiſts, and calls it <hi>an infallible Argument</hi>

Yet what he pronounces ſo like an Oracle, ſignifies no more, than if one ſhould attempt to prove, that Presbyters neither are, nor ought to be called Miniſters; becauſe in Scripture they are never mention'd under that Title: or that Baptiſm and the Supper of the Lord, neither are, nor may be called Sacraments;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65847:87"/>
becauſe that Name is not aſcribed to them in any part of Scripture. The truth is, if we muſt always uſe the words of Scripture, and no other, in treating of Religious or Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, all Tranſlations of it ought to be rejected. It ſhould be read to the People only in the Original, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſhould be made to them in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which I ſuppoſe would not be much for their Edification.</p>
               <p>You farther urge, that <hi>Timothy</hi> could not be Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> becauſe <hi>the ſtay he made there, was only upon the deſire of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and did not ariſe from the duty of his place</hi> 
                  <note n="(m)" place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 26.</note>. But what if he firſt took on him the peculiar Charge of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> immediately after S. <hi>Paul</hi> beſought him to remain there, could he not be a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of it, unleſs he was under an antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent obligation to that Reſidence? or if he did it before (which is improbable) might he not be exhorted to the performance of a thing which was incumbent on him by his Office? The Apoſtle, you know, <hi>beſeeches</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> to preſent their Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God <note n="(n)" place="margin">Rom. 12.1.</note>. He <hi>beſeeches</hi> the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to ſpeak the ſame thing <note n="(o)" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.10.</note>. He <hi>beſeeches</hi> the <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> to walk worthy of God <note n="(p)" place="margin">1 Theſſ. 2.11, 12.</note>, and <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odias</hi> and <hi>Syntiche</hi> to be of the ſame mind

in the Lord <note n="(q)" place="margin">Phil. 4.2.</note>. And from theſe inſtances it is manifeſt, that things may be duties on another account, when he makes them the matter of his Exhortation.</p>
               <p>You fancy however that <hi>Timothy</hi> could be no ſtanding Officer at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> becauſe, as you tell me, <hi>his ſtay and buſineſs there are limited to the Apoſtles return</hi>

of the Church; and thus much in effect is acknowledged by ſome Learned <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> who ſay he was the firſt Presbyter or Preſident of the Presbytery. And if they would allow ſuch Preſidents as have the full Power of Ordination, which he had Preſidents with Authority equal to his, and which, as <hi>Cameron</hi> gathers from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19 <note n="(p)" place="margin">Timothei autoritas major ſuit quam ut <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> thinks, they originally were: Then, if they pleaſe, they may call them Preſidents ſtill, and I ſhall not contend about the Name, if we are agreed about the Thing.</p>
               <p>But ſince you and many others have not made the Conceſſions I have mention'd, I ſhall farther prove, that the Office of <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> was ſuch as I have deſcrib'd, by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If it had been intended that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority committed to <hi>Timothy</hi> and others of his Rank ſhould be temporary, either this may appear from the nature of the thing, or it might have been expected that we ſhould
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65847:91"/>
have had ſome notice of it in the Scripture. For if we may take the liberty, without any grounds to faſten on it the Title of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary or Extraordinary, we may by the ſame means ſoon put an end to any Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions whatſover. But there is nothing in the nature of this Authority, that may hinder its continuance: nothing in the Scripture that declares it to be abrogated: We may conclude therefore, that as it is fit to be continued, ſo it was deſign'd to be ſo in all ſucceeding times.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have no reaſon to believe, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> would alter his own Conſtitutions without a cauſe; or that, without any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, he would put the Government of a Church into a new Model, and divert the Courſe of Diſcipline from that Channel in which it ought to run in all Ages. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſent <hi>Timothy</hi> as an Extraordinary Commiſſioner to interpoſe in the Affairs of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> we may ſuppoſe this to have been either, 1. Becauſe there was ſome Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Work, which none but Extraordinary Officers could perform: or, 2. Becauſe there were no Miniſters at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> or ſuch only as were unfit for Government: But neither of theſe can well be imagin'd: Not the firſt, for the Work was no other than what hath
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65847:91"/>
or might have been perform'd by Biſhops ever ſince: Not the ſecond, for there were Presbyters at <hi>Epheſus</hi> of eminent Gifts, ſuch as the <hi>Holy Ghoſt had made Overſeers</hi> 
                  <note n="(r)" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Acts 20.28.</note>. It ſeems improbable then, that theſe were conſtituted Supreme Standing Rulers of the Church, or that the Work for which they were ſo well qualified, was ſo ſoon taken out of their hands. Particularly it ſeems impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, either that they had the Power of Ordination, or that it would have been transfer'd from them to a Stranger, who came to viſit them, but was not of their number, and that without any ground or reaſon given, or any notice taken of them, as concern'd in the matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Flaminius</hi> did a thing acceptable to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> when he gave them permiſſion to live after their own Laws: But if he had afterwards ſent amongſt them ſome Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour with Power and Commiſſion to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule and controul their Magiſtrates, and to diſturb that Polity which had been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by his Conceſſion, by ſuch Changes and Turns of Affairs he would have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd and encouraged great Irregularities, and put his former Admirers upon upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Levity, or queſtioning his Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And let us now ſuppoſe, if you pleaſe, that ſuch Elders were conſtituted by S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:65847:92"/>
at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as were inabled and obliged to perform the higheſt Acts of Eccleſiaſtical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as Supreme Ordinary Paſtors, and were deſign'd alſo to be a Pattern for follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages: Let us farther ſuppoſe, that an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer Extraordinary had afterwards been left amongſt them with Commiſſion from that Apoſtle to alter the meaſures they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and to ſuſpend the exerciſe of a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of their Function, by taking it wholly to himſelf, and that without any Miſcarriage laid to their Charge; you may eaſily perceive what Reflections this might have occaſioned, and that ſuch Proceedings would have been ſo far from <hi>ſetting things in order,</hi> that, one has reaſon to think, they would have put them into greater confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If ſuch eminent Presbyters as were at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and a Church ſo flouriſhing as that of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was, had a Governour put over them, this ought not to be eſteemed an extraordinary thing; for doubtleſs other Presbyters and Churches, whoſe Exigences were greater, had ſo too. And if ſuch a Subordination of Officers was neceſſary when the Apoſtles were alive, I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine why an end ſhould afterwards be put to it, when there was more occaſion of it than ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:65847:92"/>Some of the moſt Learned Oppoſers of Epiſcopacy, grant, that <hi>Timothy</hi> and others of his Rank, govern'd Churches with the ſame Plenitude of Power, as Biſhops after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards did; who, as they ſay, were rais'd in the ſecond Century for the Cure of Schiſm. But if, in the common ſenſe of Chriſtians, Prelacy was uſeful to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as 'tis ſuppoſed, this muſt have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged them to preſerve it, when it had been introduced amongſt them by ſuch as were directed by the Spirit of God: and it could be no great Argument of their Wiſdom, if they laid aſide that which was of Divine Original, and were very ſhortly afterwards put upon contriving, how to reſtore it by a Humane Invention.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It ſeems very improbable, that the Apoſtle ſhould write two Epiſtles to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> only to direct him in the <hi>temporary</hi> Adminiſtration of the Affairs of a Place, where he was only to make a tranſient Viſit. But if from the Examples we have of Presbyters, and the Rules that are laid down for them in Scripture, we may gather, that ſuch ought to be continued: Then may we alſo conclude, from the Example of <hi>Timothy,</hi> from the Authority he had, and the Rules that were given to him for the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65847:93"/>
exerciſe of it, and which are of perpetual uſe, that the Office with which he was veſted, ought to be preſerv'd in the Church till the end of the World.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As we learn from the Scripture, that <hi>Timothy</hi> reſided at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> ſo it may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing confirm what I have ſaid of his relation to that Place, if there he ended his days. And this is what is teſtified by <hi>Sophronius</hi> 
                  <note n="(s)" rend="inter">Sophron. in Catalog.</note>, who tells us, that there he gloriouſly ſuffer'd Martyrdom: But more fully by an Ancient Writer in <hi>Photius</hi>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65847:95"/>
you may at your leiſure reflect on the Succeſs of your Criticiſm, and the Juſtice of your Cenſure.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen what Right <hi>Titus</hi> had to conſtitute Elders: And if it be abſurd to imagine, that all his Care of them was to be employ'd in examining and admitting them into Office, and none afterwards; it will follow, that ſince the Rules for their Converſation are directed unto him, he had over them an Epiſcopal Authority. For as the Command that was given to the Maſter of a Family, that his Children and Servants ſhould keep the Sabbath, was an Argument that they were under his Juriſdiction, which rendred him accountable for them: So when the Precepts by which Presbyters ought to govern their Actions were addreſſed to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> this ſignifies that he had Power to ſee them executed, and Offences againſt them prevented or puniſh'd. Another Argument of his Epiſcopal Power, may be taken from hence, that he is required to <hi>rebuke</hi> the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient and refractory <hi>with all Authority</hi> 
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">Tit. 2.15.</note>. That is, ſays <hi>Beza</hi> 
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">Cum omni imperio: id eſt, cum Auctorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ſummâ non ſimpliciter monendi, vel exhortandi, vel ſuadendi, ſed praecipiendi, tanquam Dei Legatus. <hi>Bez. in locum.</hi>
                  </note>, with the higheſt Authority, as an Ambaſſador of God: and <hi>to let no man deſpiſe him:</hi> which laſt advice
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65847:95"/>
confirms <hi>Beza</hi>'s Expoſition of the former, and ſhews, that if <hi>Titus</hi> would exerciſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he had, That was ſufficient to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a Reverence for him amongſt all that were committed to his care. But this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs might ſeem very ſtrange, had his Orders or his Proceedings againſt Offenders been precarious, or ſome Notions about the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Church then prevail'd, which of late have been entertain'd.</p>
               <p>In the Imperial Law the following Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is given to a Judge or Preſident <note n="(e)" place="margin">

To this I know no other anſwer can be given, than that the Authority of Biſhops, however it was only Spiritual, did in that Age ſtrike ſuch an awe upon the Minds of Chriſtians, that they were able to ſtop the Mouths of Falſe Teachers <note n="(f)" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> 1 Tim. 1.3. Titus 1.11.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65847:96"/>
by their Cenſures, this was juſtly eſteem'd a ſad preſage of their future judgment.</p>
               <p>Such Cenſures, I ſuppoſe, were meant by the Apoſtle, where he inſtructs <hi>Titus</hi> 
                  <note n="(g)" place="margin">Tit. 3.10.</note> to <hi>reject a Heretick after the firſt and ſecond admonition:</hi> On which words Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> hath this Annotation, which is not vulgar, but in my opinion very rational. <hi>The firſt and ſecond admonition, ſays he, here refers to the method preſcrib'd by Chriſt in proceeding againſt Chriſtian Offenders,</hi> Matth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18.15. <hi>but in ſome circumſtances differs from it. There is mention of a threefold admonition; one by the injured perſon alone, a ſecond by</hi> two or three <hi>taken with him, the third by the</hi> Church: <hi>But here only a</hi> firſt and ſecond admonition. <hi>The cauſe of this difference, is to be taken from the quality of the perſon to whom this</hi> Epiſtle <hi>is written,</hi> Titus <hi>a Biſhop, whereas there the ſpeech is addreſs'd to every private Chriſtian that is injured by any. Here the firſt admonition of the Biſhop car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries an Authority along with it, far above that of the private perſon, and the</hi> two or three <hi>with him, and ſo may well ſupply the place of both thoſe; and then the ſecond here will be parallel to the third there; and ſo after that is deſpis'd or proved uneffectual, it is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to proceed to Cenſures, to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the contumacious. Thus</hi> 2 Cor. 13.2.

                  <hi>immediately after the ſecond admonition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd by S.</hi> Paul, <hi>he tells the Offenders he will not ſpare, and</hi> v. 10. <hi>he tells them, that this admonition is, that he may not proceed</hi> to exciſion <hi>or</hi> cutting off, <hi>which he there calls</hi>

               <p>The ſumm of what I have ſaid of <hi>Titus,</hi> is, That he had Commiſſion to conſtitute Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and to govern with plenitude of Power, Presbyters as well as others being under his Juriſdiction. He was requir'd to inflict Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures on the diſobedient, and ſet things in order in many Churches. His Office therefore or Power was Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopal.</p>
               <p>To prove this, I have not urged any thing from the Poſtſcript of the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> and therefore I am not concern'd at your exception againſt it, or to enquire into its Authority. What is manifeſt from the Epiſtle it ſelf, and confirm'd by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Fathers, is ſufficient for my purpoſe, That however there were many Churches in <hi>Crete,</hi> yet they were govern'd by a ſingle Perſon, as their Chief Paſtor or Biſhop.</p>
               <p>What you object againſt his Epiſcopacy, from the multitude of Cities in <hi>Crete,</hi> looks
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65847:97"/>
like one of the Efforts of Mr. <hi>Prynne,</hi> and is ſo confus'd, that I can make no coherent ſenſe of it. You ſuppoſe that every Church or Congregation muſt have a Biſhop: for which you give no other reaſon, but that <hi>ſome are confident of it:</hi> and I confeſs, if mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters between us had been to be determin'd by <hi>confidence,</hi> you had often put me to a loſs. Yet here I do not ſee what ſervice it can do you. For I would demand, whether the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop you aſſign to every Congregation, was a mere Presbyter, or a Prelate? If you ſay the firſt, what is it to the purpoſe, unleſs you could prove, that he was not ſubject to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paſtor who had the Charge of many Congregations? If the laſt, what is become of the Cauſe for which you contend?</p>
               <p>If <hi>Titus,</hi> ſay you <note n="(h)" place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 45.</note>, <hi>was a Biſhop over all the Churches in</hi> Crete, <hi>he was a Biſhop of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops:</hi> that is, of Prelatical Biſhops, as your words import; and conſequently, if they expreſs your thoughts, you muſt believe that at that time there were ſuch Biſhops. And now methinks, our Controverſie appears a little oddly: For the Tables are turn'd, and you are got on the ſide of Prelacy. You contend, that the <hi>Cretian</hi> Elders were Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latical Biſhops, when I cannot allow, that they were more than Presbyters.

               <p>It is ſufficient, that he was a Paſtor of many Churches, and had Authority over their Presbyters and Deacons: For if this be true, it ſtrikes at the Root of the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> Opinions about Church-Government: And I know not what can be ſaid in Vindication of them, unleſs it be, that he was an Extraordinary Officer. This you inſiſt on, and to prove it, you tell me he was an Evangeliſt. But the Scripture ſays of him no ſuch thing. From the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture indeed we learn, that <hi>Philip</hi> was an Evangeliſt <note n="(m)" place="margin">Act. 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>8.</note>, and yet he wanted Power, either to Confirm thoſe that were Baptiz'd, or to Ordain Officers, by Impoſition of Hands <note n="(n)" place="margin">

               <p>But that he may be reckon'd amongſt the Paſtors Extraordinary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you likewiſe urge,

That <hi>he was only left in</hi> Crete, <hi>as the Deputy or the Delegate of the Apoſtle, and that but for a time till he ſhould have eſtabliſhed Churches in every City, and Organiz'd them with Elders, which having done,</hi> you ſay, <hi>'tis very probable that he return'd again to S.</hi> Paul, <hi>to give an Account of that Affair</hi>; and then, you think, his Commiſſion expir'd.

               <p>As for their Argument, that <hi>Symbolical Theology is not Argumentative,</hi> it is no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be admitted, than as it ſignifies, that Parables and Figures are not to be ſtretched beyond the plain intention of any Author: But if no determinate ſenſe can be gather'd from them, this would make a great part of the Holy Scriptures uſeleſs to us, and leave us mightily in the dark concerning the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, which yet the Reformed think, and that with good reaſon, they clearly apprehend. Yet after all, we do not read of the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Angels,</hi> but of the <hi>Seven Stars,</hi> of which the <hi>Angels</hi> are the explication, and therefore muſt be ſuppos'd to be intelligible: And indeed there ſeems to be no difficulty in this, but what has been created by thoſe

               <p>You pretend not to have any certainty that the Title of theſe <hi>Angels</hi> was Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical. For <hi>what,</hi> ſay you <note n="(u)" place="margin">

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65847:104"/>
the things enjoin'd, and in carrying on the work of Reformation with the greater vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and application.</p>
               <p>If theſe <hi>Angels</hi> were neither Celeſtial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, nor the Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> themſelves; it cannot be imagin'd that they were any thing elſe but the Paſtors of thoſe Churches.

'Tis ſaid expreſly in Scripture that <hi>the ſeven Stars are the Angels:</hi> there were therefore juſt ſo many <hi>Angels</hi> as there were <hi>Stars.</hi> The <hi>Churches</hi> alſo were <hi>ſeven,</hi> and every <hi>Church</hi> had its diſtinct and peculiar <hi>Angel</hi>; and if any, notwithſtanding this, deny that the number of the <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> was equal, they ſeem not in a capacity to be convinced of any thing by the cleareſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration.</p>
               <p>As for the conceit, that every <hi>Angel</hi> was a Company, it is inconſiſtent with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; for the <hi>Angels</hi> are not called <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations</hi> but <hi>ſeven Stars.</hi> And ſays <hi>Suidas,</hi>

               <p>Such a neceſſity there is not here, for an <hi>Angel</hi> no more properly ſignifies a Colledge of <hi>Angels</hi> than a man ſignifies a Troop or a Corporation. Nor are the deſcriptions of the ſeveral Angels applicable to a multitude, unleſs we will ſuppoſe that all the Elders of the reſpective Societies deſerv'd the ſame particular reproof or commendation, which hath not the leaſt ſhadow of Truth.</p>
               <p>We read indeed, that the ſtrong Cattel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom <hi>Jacob</hi> placed his Rods generally brought forth the <hi>ſpeckled</hi> or <hi>ringſtraked,</hi> and this we impute to a Miracle, and queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not the thing, becauſe it is related by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> 
                  <note n="(z)" place="margin">Gen. 30</note>.

               <p>Yet I deny not that amongſt the things that are written to the <hi>Angels,</hi> there are ſome inſtructions mingled, in which others are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly

And from hence <hi>Smectymnuus</hi> and the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of Divines argue, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Angel</hi> muſt be underſtood <hi>collectively.</hi> But they might have conſider'd that ſometimes in the Holy Scripture, diſcourſes begun with one are diverted to many; and with many, to one; and that without any artificial tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. For example, S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the fourth Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> ver. 3. writes thus, <hi>I intreat thee Yoke fellow.</hi> And he concludes his ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> with theſe words; <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt be with thy ſpirit. Grace be with you</hi>; And one might as well infer from hence, that the <hi>Philippians</hi> were a ſingle perſon, and <hi>Timothy</hi> a multitude, as conclude from the like inſtance, that every <hi>Angel</hi> of the ſeveral <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Churches was a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen, that theſe <hi>Angels</hi> were men, and not Celeſtial Spirits. We have alſo ſeen, that they were <hi>ſeven</hi> individual Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, and not ſo many <hi>Collective</hi> Bodies.

               <p>This is different from the account which is given of them by <hi>Beza:</hi> for having ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd they were no more than <hi>Preſidents</hi> of the Presbyteries without Authority over them, he goes on to ſuppoſe that the Office of <hi>Preſidents</hi> was <hi>Ambulatory,</hi> paſſing from one Presbyter to another in a <hi>circular motion.</hi> He tragically complains that it became fixed: For from hence, he ſays <note n="(d)" place="margin">Bez. in Apocal. <hi>2.1.</hi>

               <p>But I return to the Propoſition from which he diverted me: and which I think may be thus confirm'd.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If theſe Paſtours that are called <hi>Angels</hi> were only ſo ſtyled, as they were <hi>Preſidents</hi> of the ſeveral <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> then were they the <hi>Angels</hi> of the <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> but not of the Churches; which is directly contrary to what is ſaid of them in the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65847:108"/>
their Function, and would ſupport thoſe that were ſo near him in the diſcharge of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They were called <hi>Angels</hi> in alluſion to the practice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who attributed to their High Prieſt the Title of <hi>Angel.</hi> For of him, I ſuppoſe, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, where he ſays, <hi>Suffer not thy mouth to cauſe thy fleſh to ſin, neither ſay thou before the Angel it was an error.</hi> Eccl. 5.6. I cannot think that <hi>Solomon</hi> here advis'd a perſon that had bound himſelf by a Vow, not to make this ſpeech before the Meſſiah or any Miniſtring Spirits (as ſome Interpreters conceive) or not to attempt to delude with words any inviſible Beings.

Farther than this, the ſimilitude may not be extended, unleſs it be ſaid, that as there is but one Catholick Church, which is the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Iſrael,</hi> ſo Myſtically there is but one Biſhop. For all the Biſhops were anciently

eſteem'd as one; and what was done by one in the due exerciſe of his Office, was eſteem'd the Act of the whole Colledge. A Notion that ſuppoſes an equality of all Biſhops in their Office and Authority, and conſequently is ſo far from affording any advantage to the Popes, that it directly oppoſes their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and has ſometimes been us'd, to very good purpoſe, to prevent their Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and check their Ambition.</p>

And this is what may be illuſtrated from the following inſtance, which I have choſen out of ſeveral that might be given.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Angel</hi> of the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> is celebrated for his perſonal Virtues. He dwelt where Satan's ſeat was, and yet he held faſt the name of Chriſt, and denyed not the Faith in thoſe days when <hi>Antipas</hi> the faithful Martyr was ſlain. C. 2. v. 13. But ſome defect was imputed to him as a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, <hi>I have a few things againſt thee, ſaith the Lord, becauſe thou haſt them there that hold the doctrine of</hi> Balaam, <hi>&amp;c. So thou haſt alſo them which hold the doctrine of the</hi> Nicolaitans, <hi>which thing I hate,</hi> ver. 14, 15. And from hence we may gather, that it was in his power to ſuppreſs thoſe pernicious Doctrines and Sects that diſturb'd the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65847:110"/>
Church, and for this purpoſe the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of any Coordinate Officers was not neceſſary. He could not alledge, that he wanted Authority, or that others controul'd him in his proceedings againſt enormities: But as it was laid to his charge alone, that he had not ſtopt the mouths of Gainſayers: ſo he alone was warn'd to repent for this want of Diſcipline, leſt the Lord ſhould <hi>come quickly and fight againſt him with the ſword of his mouth,</hi> ver. 16. Since therefore this <hi>Angel</hi> had full power of reforming Abuſes, ſince the defect of that Reformation is intirely imputed to him: Since there is not the leaſt appearance that he had any Collegues join'd in Commiſſion with him, whoſe Votes were neceſſary for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of what was expected from him: and ſince he alone is repreſented as reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the miſcarriages of the Chriſtians at <hi>Pergamus,</hi> 'tis manifeſt, that they were all under his Juriſdiction. He might have Subordinate Officers, but he had no Equals.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Angels</hi> of the Churches had ſuch power as I have aſcrib'd to them, there is no ground to ſuſpect that they unjuſtly uſurp'd it. For if it be a good Argument that the <hi>Text</hi> it ſelf of the Old Teſtament had not been corrupted by the Scribes and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65847:111"/>
Phariſees, when our Saviour and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were upon Earth, that neither of them laid it to the charge of thoſe wicked men: we may conclude from the Epiſtles directed to theſe <hi>Angels,</hi> that our Lord was not offended at the Station which they had in the Churches, ſince he cenſures their faults and makes that no part of them. But this is not all that may be ſaid for it: He plainly ſignifies his approbation of it, both in condemning their former remiſneſs, and in exciting them to greater vigour, in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Office.</p>
               <p>This agrees exactly with the Hiſtorical Accounts that we have of the firſt Age, and particularly with what <hi>Clemens Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>

This may give us reaſon to think, that all the Churches in the World were at that time under an Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Adminiſtration; eſpecially if it appear, that they were ſo in the following Age: But before I come to make enquiry into that, it may be requiſite to remove out of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65847:112"/>
the way ſome Objections that relate to the Apoſtles days.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You argue from <hi>Acts</hi> 20.17, 28. <hi>Titus</hi> 1.5, 7. that mere Presbyters were Biſhops. And this I am ready to grant: But then it muſt be acknowledged, that the Presbyters mention'd in thoſe places, were ſubordinate to other Paſtors, and conſequently, a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of their Office ſuppoſes a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſuch Superiors as they had, to the end of the World.</p>
               <p>Their Superiors were S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and if there be any queſtion, whether the Name of Biſhops may be aſcribed to them, it may be determin'd from what has been ſaid already. For if it belongs to the Apoſtles, as I have prov'd from the words of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſome paſſages of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, it may fitly be apply'd, not only to the <hi>Twelve,</hi> but to all their Colleagues. <hi>But Epiſcopacy,</hi> you tell me <note n="(t)" place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 3.</note>, <hi>is a word of ample ſignification; for 'tis not only to be met with in</hi> Homer, Plutarch, Cicero, <hi>but it is apply'd to God by</hi> Baſil, <hi>and to the Elders by</hi> Peter: <hi>nothing therefore is deducible from it, as to the ſpecial nature of any Office, except by way of Analogy.</hi> And what then? Did I ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that it had but one ſenſe in all the Books where it occurs, whether they are
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65847:113"/>
Sacred or Profane? Did I ever aſſert, that none but Apoſtles were called Biſhops, and deduce from that Title an account of the ſpecial Nature of their Office? If you can impute to me neither of theſe things, you muſt be content to fight with your own ſhadow: And I ſhall think it enough, that the inſtances I have produced, perform what I deſign'd by them. They ſhew, that in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, the Apoſtles were Biſhops, and particularly, that S. <hi>James</hi> was a Biſhop, whatever exceptions ſome have taken againſt it, we ſpeak the Language of the Scripture and the Fathers: They alſo ſhew, that if mere Presbyters were Biſhops, others had the ſame denomination, who had Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over them, and anſwer the Objections againſt Prelacy, that have been rais'd from <hi>Acts</hi> 20.17, 28. and other places.</p>

As if the whole Scheme of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which the Apoſtles eſtabliſhed, might be taken from that one Act, or they had done nothing, but what this Author

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65847:118"/>
as much purpoſe, that is, to teſtifie ſuch things as never enter'd into their thoughts. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> knew very well, that plurality of Biſhops in one City, proceeded commonly from Schiſm or Hereſie, and was far enough from taking that to be an Argument of the Purity of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe of Chriſtians, both before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his own time, was eſteem'd a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>

               <p>WE have ſeen that in the ſecond and other Centuries, the Churches were govern'd by ſingle perſons, who were diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd by the Name of Biſhops: And in the next place, I ſhall prove, that the Biſhops were Succeſſors to the Apoſtles: Becauſe this will confirm my Leading Propoſition, That the Apoſtles were Ordinary Paſtors, and prepare my way to conſider, how the Biſhops ſtood related amongſt themſelves and to others, and what regard is due to perſons of their Character.</p>
               <p>That the Biſhops were Succeſſors to the Apoſtles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> thought might be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd from the Prediction that was made to the Church by the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in theſe words, <hi>In ſtead of thy Fathers ſhall be thy Children</hi>

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65847:120"/>
Apoſtles were inſtituted Biſhops in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and their Succeſſors to our own time; and they taught us none of the dotages of, theſe men: But if the Apoſtles knew any hidden Myſteries, which they ſecretly taught the perfect, they would chiefly have imparted them to the perſons to whom they committed the Churches.

               </p>
               <p>Thus that Excellent Father, and his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony is the more conſiderable, becauſe of his great Antiquity. For 'tis probable, he was born ſeveral years before the death of S. <hi>John</hi>

               <p>To invalidate his Authority, you tell me, <hi>he is agreed by ſome to have affirm'd, that our Lord Chriſt did undergo his paſſion in the fiftieth year of his age.</hi> As if that might better be determin'd by their agreement about it than his own Writings, in which we find no ſuch thing. He no where fixes the period of our Saviours Paſſion: He no where aſſigns it to a certain year: Yet I grant, he was of opinion, that our Saviour liv'd about fifty years, if that paſſage be his, wherein he treats of this matter <note n="(m)" place="margin">

                  </note> and other Learned Men conceive, it has been corrupted, it ſeeming incredible to them, that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſhould attribute to our Lord ſo many years in that very Chapter, wherein he reckons no more than three <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſovers</hi> which he celebrated after he enter'd upon the thirtieth year of his Age, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, He did eat the laſt of them the day before his ſuffering.</p>
               <p>But there being no Copies to juſtifie that Charge of Corruption, what I inſiſt upon is, That if <hi>Irenaeus</hi> was miſtaken in the time of Chriſts Paſſion, it does not follow that he was ſo in the thing which I have cited from him. If he err'd concerning that Period a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which all mankind have been in the dark; he might notwithſtanding be a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Witneſs of ſuch matters as could not well eſcape his notice and have nothing in them that is improbable.</p>
               <p>Such was the ſeverity of our Saviours Life and deportment that, it may ſeem, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd more aged than he was: For when the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>Thou art not yet fifty years old</hi> 
                  <note n="(o)" place="margin">Joh. 8.57.</note>, doubtleſs they thought, he was near ſo much. And it is eaſie then to conceive, how the report might ariſe and be continued, which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> follow'd: But it was ſo far from becoming an univerſal Tradition, that it was never embraced, that we find, by ſo much
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65847:121"/>
as two of the Fathers. The Caſe is very different when he relates, who ſucceeded the Apoſtles, for of this lie could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ignorant, that lived ſo near them. And the account he gives having been confirm'd by many others, and having met with an univerſal approbation, cannot be rejected by us with any ſhadow of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>But you ſay, <hi>Admitting</hi> Irenaeus<hi>'s Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be unblemiſhed and cite as one could wiſh it, yet on this occaſion, it will do me but ſmall ſervice: for the force of the teſtimony which</hi> I cite from him <hi>depends on the word</hi> Magiſterium, <hi>and</hi> Magiſterium <hi>ſignifies, not,</hi> as I underſtand it, <hi>a Maſterly Authority, but Teaching and Doctrine: for in this latter ſenſe the word is often us'd by the Fathers and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by S.</hi> Cyprian, <hi>as I may ſee lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Ep.</hi> 3. <hi>and in other places.</hi> Yet in that very Epiſtle to which you refer me, we may not underſtand by it Doctrine without Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor is it limited to any ſuch ſenſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Ancient Writers.

From hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that <hi>Locus Magiſterii</hi> in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> may fitly be tranſlated, the place of Authority or Government. And that it ought to be ſo, will be manifeſt, if it be conſider'd, that he thought it peculiar to the Biſhops, to ſucceed the Apoſtles in their own place or Office. He could not think it peculiar to them to derive from the Apoſtles the meer power of preaching, which was known to be common to other Miniſters. His words therefore can import no leſs, than that the Biſhops were conſtituted Supreme Paſtors without that dependance on Presbyters which theſe had on them; or, that they were veſted with ſuch Authority over other Officers and Churches as the Apoſtles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enjoy'd and exercis'd.</p>
               <p>And now it may be fit, and it will be no difficult matter, to anſwer your Objection, which I omitted before, againſt the Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Biſhops to the Apoſtles, and which is to this effect. <hi>The Prelates,</hi> you conceive, <hi>cannot be ſaid to be the Apoſtles Succeſſors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtles in their life time could not conſtitute any Officers over whom they did not
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65847:122"/>
retain a Juriſdiction, nor convey to others the places which,</hi> you ſuppoſe, <hi>they ſtill kept.</hi> But if it be ſaid they appointed that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates ſhould be inducted into thoſe places after their deceaſe, you think, <hi>there is no credible tradition tranſmitted to us of that matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here is one thing you have forgotten that may deſerve to be conſider'd, which is, that unleſs all the Apoſtles had died together the Survivers might put others into the places of the deceas'd. Accordingly, tho <hi>Simeon</hi> was not nominated by S. <hi>James</hi> to be his Succeſſor, nor came into his place whilſt he was alive, yet after the death of that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, he was by others Conſtituted Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>

               <p>It is farther obſervable, that the Apoſtles, before their deceaſe, were ſometimes obliged to withdraw themſelves from the Churches which they had planted and govern'd, and thereupon they committed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them to fit perſons, who may well be ſaid to be their Succeſſors in that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. Eſpecially ſince, as I have prov'd, the Apoſtles Communicated to them the ſame Authority that themſelves had exercis'd. Yet as <hi>Julius Capitolinus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us <note n="(u)" place="margin">Vit. Ver. <hi>c. 3, 4. p. 225.</hi> vid. not. Salmaſ. ad loc.</note>, that <hi>Lucius</hi> was as obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of <hi>Marcus,</hi> who made him Partner of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65847:123"/>
his Empire as a <hi>Preſident</hi> was wont to be of the <hi>Emperor</hi> himſelf: Thus <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> and others of the ſame Rank, who had been Ordain'd by the Apoſtles, might ſtill pay them ſuch reſpect and deference as was due to perſons of incomparable excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and yet all be of the ſame Order.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles having Communicated their Epiſcopal Authority to ſome in their own time, theſe tranſmitted it to others in the following Centuries: and in this manner it has been conveyed to Biſhops in all Ages. The Biſhops therefore may be ſaid to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Apoſtles, and that not only in the Government of Churches, which were of their Plantation, but of others alſo in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to which they never arriv'd. For ſince they had Commiſſion to bring all Nations under the Diſcipline of Chriſt, and govern them in his name, a Right to that deſcends to their Spiritual Heirs, and they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe it in all the parts of the World.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding your attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that the Apoſtles could have no Succeſſors, you make no doubt to affirm, that <hi>Presbyters ſucceed them in their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary work:</hi> And about this I ſhall make ſome enquiry, when I have firſt put you in mind, that either you muſt ſuppoſe, theſe Presbyters were ſubject to the Apoſtles in
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65847:123"/>
their diſcharge of that work, and if ſo, a ſubjection was conſiſtent with a Succeſſion to them; or elſe they were not ſubject, and then you muſt allow that the Apoſtles Conſtituted Officers over whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd no Juriſdiction. Take it which way you pleaſe, you are concern'd, I think, to reject or anſwer your own Argument.</p>

               <p>'Tis true ſome Biſhops were diſtinguiſh'd from others by a <hi>Primacy</hi> of Order, and had the chief direction of Eccleſiaſtical Affairs. When Synods were call'd, they preſided in them; and for this they had the example of S. <hi>James</hi> in the Council of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But their Primacy depended on the conſent of other Biſhops, and was mutable. It did not render them Judges of the reſt within their ſeveral Provinces, nor might they condemn any of them by their own Sentence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Suffrages of their Collegues.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the pureſt Ages after the Apoſtles, the Biſhops ſtood related to Presbyters as Superiors: And in this it is that our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie is chiefly concern'd.

He was a perſon of ſo much Sanctity and Zeal, that he was willing to endure all the torments that the Devil could inflict, that he might be with Chriſt, and thought it more deſirable to be torn in pieces by wild Beaſts for his ſake, than to be Emperor of the World.

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65847:128"/>
thoughts. For, to begin where you leave off, that I may remove out of the way, what is little to our purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You ſuppoſe that the <hi>Patriarch</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by <hi>Hadrian</hi> was a Chriſtian. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there was not then in the World any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Officer, who did bear that title. <hi>Eutychius</hi> indeed informs us, that there were <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi>; but this was an Argument of his ignorance, unleſs the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy which the Learned and Noble <hi>Job Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolfus</hi>

                     <hi>Comment. in Hiſt.

This is the moſt plauſible thing that can be ſaid in his vindication: But that he did not only ſpeak properly, but <hi>may as well be believ'd to have forgotten his own name as that of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,</hi> is a thought peculiar to your ſelf.</p>
               <p>It is not my buſineſs here to enquire into the Original of <hi>Patriarchs</hi> in the Chriſtian Church. It is ſufficient for my purpoſe, that they are not mention'd by any Author under that Title before <hi>Socrates</hi> who flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd in the fifth Century. But the <hi>Jews</hi> had their <hi>Patriarchs</hi> much more early, as <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobus Gothofredus</hi>

I reckon this in <hi>Vopiſcus,</hi> not only for the reaſon already given, but becauſe it is ſaid, that he was compell'd to worſhip Chriſt. If he had been a Chriſtian there had been no need of that compulſion: neither can it be ſuppos'd that the Infidels would have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to force him to do what his avowed Principles obliged him to perform. Indeed if ſome cruelty had been us'd to extort from him a denial of Chriſt, this had been an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that he made profeſſion of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; to which he had no Title, if without violence he could not be brought to confeſs our Saviour and adore him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You ſuppoſe, the little knowledge <hi>Hadrian</hi> had of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Chriſtians confutes my Argument taken from his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, by which I would prove that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Biſhop in his time was diſtinct from that of a Presbyter, whereas it gives it the greater force: For the thing may well be thought to be the more evident, in that it was taken notice of by a perſon who was ſo little acquainted with the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> affairs in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. You ſuppoſe that becauſe <hi>Hadrian</hi> was under great miſtakes concerning the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Chriſtians</hi> and their <hi>Biſhops,</hi> this muſt
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:65847:129"/>
render his teſtimony uſeleſs; whereas it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proves what I deſign'd by it, whether his deſcription of them be true or falſe. For whoſoever gave him this relation, it cannot be imagin'd that they invented a ſort of Men that never were in being, that they might have a ſubject for their accuſation: Nor is there any ground to believe that <hi>Hadrian</hi> or his Informers had the Spirit of Prophecy or diſcover'd by Divination that there would be ſuch Officers in ſucceeding times as had not then been heard of; and that they contriv'd to bring an odium upon the Prelates before they did exiſt. But as we may collect from the Emperors words, that whether the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were ſo fickle or not as he repreſents them, yet there were Chriſtians; ſo we may conclude that whether the Biſhops worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped <hi>Serapis</hi> or not, there were <hi>Biſhops</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding: And this is all that I intended by this inſtance.</p>
               <p>Yet I may further add, that if the charge againſt theſe <hi>Biſhops</hi> be falſe, as you would have it, it is more for my purpoſe than if it were true; as it is far more deſirable that perſons of their Character ſhould walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of their vocation, than diſhonour it by their practices, and be loaded with infamy and reproach. In your endeavours there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to vindicate their innocence, you have
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65847:129"/>
taken care to confute your own Objection; which is founded on the injuſtice of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation that the Emperor brings againſt them. But if you had omitted this ſtroke, you had loſt a fair opportunity of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd of a quaint conceit which I have not met with in any other Author, and I believe it to be new. As for the Devotion you ſay of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Biſhops to <hi>Serapis,</hi> you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine any occaſion they ſhould give, which with any colour ſhould render them ſuſpected of Idolatry, but their <hi>Signing</hi> with the <hi>Sign</hi> of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and the reaſon why you are inclin'd to think ſo is, becauſe <hi>Pignori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> in his <hi>Menſa Iſiaca</hi> aſſures us that <hi>Serapis</hi> was anciently denoted by a Croſs; and you conceive that this might be the <hi>Hieroglyphick of the three headed Monſter of which</hi> Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarius <hi>gives the</hi> Icon <hi>ſince that was annected to the Image of</hi> Serapis. Now <hi>Chartarius</hi> and his terrible <hi>Icon</hi> I never ſaw, but am apt to think, that the act of ſigning with the Croſs, which leaves no viſible impreſſion behind it, hath no great reſemblance of a <hi>three headed Monſter</hi>: And however <hi>Pignorius</hi> ſays, that the <hi>Croſs</hi> denotes <hi>Serapis,</hi> I know not that he hath given us any aſſurance of it.

for in both it is ſaid to ſignifie the life to come.</p>
               <p>Be it as it will: The <hi>Egyptians</hi> muſt have been very fooliſh, if they gather'd that the Biſhops were Worſhippers of <hi>Serapis,</hi> from the uſe of that which was a Sign of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and of their adherence to Chriſt, in oppoſition to all Idolatry. The Heathens could without any ſuch ground caſt reproach on the innocent, and of this they made no difficulty. The Apologiſts generally take notice how they accus'd the Chriſtians of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Inceſt,</hi> and <hi>devouring mans fleſh,</hi> when they were the holieſt and the moſt vertuous perſons in the world. <hi>Euſebius</hi> acquaints us <note n="(*)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hiſt. Eccl.</hi> l. 5. c. 6.</note>, that they forged lies and calumnies againſt our Lord himſelf under the name of <hi>Pilat</hi>'s Acts; and no wonder that they treated the Servants no better than they did the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the Family. But to give more colour to their ſlanders, they compell'd ſome infamous perſons to profeſs themſelves Chriſtians <note n="(x)" place="margin">Vid. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeb. ibid.</note>, that they might load thoſe that were ſo indeed with the blackeſt aſperſions. And if the Paſtours of the Church fled from the rage of Perſecution or hid themſelves, 'tis eaſie to conceive that men extreamly malicious againſt them and their Religion, might hite or force ſome Wretches to perſonate them in the worſhip
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65847:130"/>
of <hi>Serapis:</hi> and we may be aſſur'd that any thing which tended to the diſhonour of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity would gain an eaſie belief amongſt the Adverſaries. But whether the Calumny was propagated this, or ſome other way againſt the Biſhops, I am not much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd about it, ſince we are agreed about their exiſtence and their innocence.</p>
               <p>But about their Character you have rais'd ſome doubt, for <hi>in this Epiſtle,</hi> you ſay, <hi>there is only the name of Biſhop or Presbyter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſpecification of the Office ſignified by it, either as to its nature or limits.</hi> As if theſe things could not be known, unleſs we had here met with their deſcription; or the Emperor could not write intelligibly unleſs he had left us a <hi>Clavis</hi> or <hi>Gloſſary</hi> to let us into his meaning. I thought it had been ſufficient for that purpoſe, that he uſes the word Biſhop in ſuch a ſenſe as the other Writers of that Age generally did; none of which apply it to any other perſon of their own time but the Prelate only. Beſides, as I have ſhew'd, he diſtinguiſhes the Biſhop from the Presbyter, for which he would have had no reaſon, had their Office been the ſame; as he would have had no cauſe to make the difference, he does, between <hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians, had they been of the ſame Principles and Religion.</p>

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65847:131"/>
the Presbyter and Deacon, and plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, that the Biſhop was only a Presbyter honour'd with the firſt Seat.</hi> And how is it that he plainly intimates this? Has he in any other part of his Writings given us any notice of ſuch a Presbyter and his Seat? No: He hath not ſaid a word about them. Hath any other Writer in or near his time left us a deſcription of them? No: they mention no ſuch matter. Could he not ſpeak of Presbyters, but one of them muſt needs be the Preſident and Moderator in the Conſiſtory? That is not pretended. How hath he then ſo <hi>plainly intimated,</hi> that there was ſuch a perſon? No other way, but by a profound ſilence about him. And thus a man that ſpeaks not a word, or is aſleep, may <hi>plainly intimate</hi> what you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>'Tis certain however, that in the paſſage to which you refer me, he ſpeaks but of two Ranks of Eccleſiaſtical Officers, yet he knew there were more; and he mentions three not only in his <hi>Paedagogue,</hi> but in his <hi>Stromata:</hi> and his ſilence in one place can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not evacuate what he expreſly declares in another.</p>

               <p>But <hi>Tertullian,</hi> you tell me, <hi>does more than ſeem to be on your ſide, when ſpeaking of the Chriſtian Congregations, both as to their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline and Government, and to their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, he ſays,</hi> Praeſident probati quiquo Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ores, &amp;c. <hi>That the Presbyters have the Rule and Government in them.</hi> And here you take it for granted, that theſe <hi>Seniores</hi> are mere Presbyters, and yet you know, this is a thing in queſtion, a thing that hath been deny'd by many, not without good appearance of reaſon, ſince the Titles of <hi>Ancients</hi> or <hi>Elders</hi> have ſometimes been apply'd to Biſhops, as <hi>Blondel</hi> will inform you, and that it is ſo here, the words ſeem to import.</p>
               <p>But about this, I may have occaſion to diſcourſe in another place. And at preſent I will ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Seniors Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks of, were meer Presbyters, and yet did preſide, I know not however, why he ſhould <hi>more than ſeem to be on your ſide</hi>; but that great is the ſtrength of Imagination. For mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt it is from him, as we have ſeen, that the Biſhop ſtood related to the Presbyters as
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:65847:132"/>
their High Prieſt: and without his licence or permiſſion, they could not baptize. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding therefore they might preſide in particular Congregations, or otherwiſe as his Aſſiſtants, yet it was with dependance on him, and ſubordination to him in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Government.</p>
               <p>To evade this, you ſay, <hi>That ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Officers,</hi> according to <hi>Tertullian, was rather a matter of Order for peace ſake, and the honour of the Church, than by Divine Inſtitution.</hi> There was however ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, and as for the Original of it, that is another Queſtion; which may alſo be reſolv'd from this Father. For he declares, that Biſhops were conſtituted by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and there is no doubt, but one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of it was, the welfare of the Church; which without Peace and Order cannot be preſerv'd. Indeed, if there had been no ſuch Inſtitution, if the Honor of the Church were not to be regarded, and if Peace, which is ſo much recommended in the Goſpel were an unneceſſary thing, then he would have allow'd, that even <hi>Lay-men</hi> might baptize: But now he charges them not to invade thoſe things that belong to their Superiors, nor to uſurp the Epiſcopal Function <note n="(b)" place="margin">Cùm ea Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joribus compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, ne ſibi ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumant dicatum Epiſcopis Officium Epiſcopatus. <hi>De Bapt. c. 17. p. 231.</hi>

               <p>IF matters between us may be determin'd by the Writings of the Ancients, as you have granted, I think it ſufficiently evident from what has been ſaid, that Churches were govern'd by Biſhops in the beſt Ages after the deceaſe of the Apoſtles. And for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Argument, and to prevent eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, I obſerve, That it is manifeſt from the Teſtimony of the Fathers, 1. That after the Apoſtles days there was no ſpace of time without Epiſcopacy: Nor 2. Was there any Country without it, where Chriſtianity prevail'd.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There was no ſpace of time after the deceaſe of the Apoſtles without Epiſcopacy. There was no ſuch Interval of forty years
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:65847:134"/>
between that Period, and the Conſtitution of Biſhops, as <hi>Blondel</hi>

                     <hi>Wal. Meſſ.</hi> p. 7.</note> was more cautious, who acknowledges, that the diſtinction of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Biſhops and Presbyters was moſt Ancient, and only requires, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times ſhould be excepted: and yet his demand is too extravagant. For the Fathers generally believ'd, that there was ſuch a diſtinction in their days, and that by their appointment in Churches of their own plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>This may appear from what has been ſaid already, and it may be farther confirm'd from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who thus upbraids the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks with their Novelty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and confutes their pretences to Tradition <note n="(g)" rend="inter">Edant origines Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſuarum: evolvánt ordinem Epiſcoporum ſuorum ità per ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones ab initio decurrentem, ut pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ille Epiſcopus aliquem ex A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolis vel Apoſtolicis viris, qui tamen cum Apoſtolis perſeveraverit, habuerit Auctorem &amp; Anteceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem.

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65847:134"/>
this the <hi>Apoſtolical Churches</hi> did. And thus he thought to ſtop the mouths of Gain-ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and triumphs much in his Argument. But his attempt had been extremely vain, if they might have return'd him this Anſwer. <hi>Sir, you are under a miſtake, or would impoſe on us. The Apoſtles were Extraordinary Officers, and had no Succeſſors, nor did they conſtitute any Biſhops, as you pretend. The Biſhops you ſpeak of, have deprav'd the Government of the Church: They have advanced themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſteps to corruption, and contrary to the Divine Inſtitution, uſurpt a power over their Brethren. What reaſon have we then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that they hold faſt that profeſſion of faith which was once deliver'd to the Saints, ſince they have ſo ambitiouſly trampled on their Equals, and made no conſcience to eſtabliſh their own Greatneſs on the ruines of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Diſcipline. 'Tis our Glory, that we have none of them, and that we regard not their Authority.</hi> Yet upon your grounds, this they might have replied to the Confuſion of that Learned Father, had it then been believ'd that Epiſcopacy was an Innovation.</p>
               <p>I know it has been objected, that there are Intricacies and Inconſiſtences in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogues of the Succeſſions which the Fathers have left us.

Presbyter, as you have entertain'd, but made the ſame diſtinction between him and his Clergy, as there was between the High Prieſt and the other Prieſts that were under his Authority.</p>
               <p>Another thing for which you cite this Commentator, is, the information he gives us, that the Eldeſt was always the Firſt Presbyter <note n="(g)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Comment. in</hi> Epheſ. 4.11.</note>, till the inconveniences of that courſe occaſion'd the change which he ſays was made by a Council. But to this I know not how to aſſent, becauſe it appears from Scripture, and the Writings of the moſt Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Fathers, that they who in the early times of Chriſtianity, were advanced to the Charge of Biſhops, were commonly qualified for it, and diſtinguiſh'd, by the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, or their own perſonal worth; and there is no probability that a meer number of years was then held ſufficient to recommend a perſon to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Office in the Chriſtian Church. Yet if there was ſometime ſuch preference given to ſeniority, and ſuch a change made in ſome particular Country, as the Author mentions, I am not concern'd about it. But if you think, the Ancient Cuſtom he ſpeaks of, was univerſal, and that a departure from it over the World, was decreed by a General

                  <hi>If we may believe</hi> Danaeus, ſay you, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius <hi>himſelf was at laſt compell'd to confeſs that in the Age of the Apoſtles no ſuch diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between Biſhops and Presbyters, as I contend for, was to be found.</hi> To which I reply, If we may believe <hi>Epiphanius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he confeſs'd no ſuch matter. On the contrary, when he had repreſented <hi>Aerius</hi> as the plague of mankind <note n="(w)" place="margin">

But he did not give direction to any of the Presbyters, not to receive an accuſation againſt a Biſhop, not to rebuke a Biſhop.</hi> This then is a manifeſt Argument of the diſparity of thoſe Officers in the judgment of <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi> But if you can make him confeſs what he denies: if you can make him approve what he confutes; and bring him to an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with one whom he repreſents as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious villain and a monſter; then you may believe <hi>Danaeus.</hi> But his credit labours much at preſent, and you have ſaid nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</p>
               <p>It hath been little for the honour of the Presbyterian Government that the Father of it hath been thought to be <hi>Aerius</hi>: But you think it is of more ancient and better extraction.

               <head>CHAP. XVI. Prelacy is no degeneracy from an Apoſtolical Conſtitution. The Paſtours of the Church that came next after the Apoſtles did not conſpire to deprave any Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was of Divine appointment.</head>
               <p>IF we may not believe the ridiculous Fable of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Monks, you have not been able to prove, that any part of the Chriſtian world, for many Ages after the deceaſe of the Apoſtles, was without Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Government. Yet, as if the matter were clear on your ſide, and paſt all doubt, you take it for granted, that Prelacy is a <hi>degeneracy</hi> from an Apoſtolical Conſtitution. You pretend to have obſerv'd the Springs and Motions by which it was advanced; and to diſcover, on what grounds it was introduced, and by what degrees it grew up to that Grandeur in which it now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.</p>
               <p n="1">

                     <hi>P.</hi> 19.</note>, <hi>and by pretences of ſome Analogy unto the Orders of that Fabrick.</hi> And a little before you tell me, that <hi>when the Judaizing Opinion, which prevail'd mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly even in the days of the Apoſtles, had, after their deceaſe, diffus'd and ſpread it ſelf far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that Chriſtians came into the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Orders, Beauty and Pomp of the Temple, which was but a fixed Tabernacle, and Chriſtianity it ſelf became conſider'd (as by ſome this day) but as another kind of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm, then Miniſters were turned into Prieſts, Deacons to Levites.</hi> A wonderful transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation at ſuch a time! And it may ſeem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange, that the Chriſtians ſhould be much more charm'd with the <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Pomp</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> when it was laid in aſhes, than they were when it ſtood in its Glory. To deal plainly with you, I take this to be very abſurd, and inconſiſtent with the beſt Records, we have, of the firſt Ages. For it appears from them, that the weak Brethren, as they were call'd, were moſt zealous at the firſt for the Moſaical Rites; and that S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf did more in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with them and the <hi>Jews,</hi> than all the Biſhops in the world in the following Century.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:65847:149"/>The truth is, when an end was put to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Polity, the <hi>Judaizers</hi> made a Sect by themſelves: and the Paſtours of the Church thought fit to bury the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Rites in the ruins of the Temple, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly aſſerted their freedom from them. At leaſt they let them fall by degrees: And 'tis obſervable, that when the great Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie was rais'd about the keeping of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> however they that contended, it ought to be obſerv'd exactly at the time of the <hi>Jewiſh Paſſover,</hi> had more to ſay for themſelves from <hi>Tradition,</hi> yet the matter was carried and determin'd on the ſide of <hi>Chriſtian Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that Liberty doth not leave all things indifferent that were drawn by <hi>Analogy</hi> from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Laws or Cuſtoms.

All theſe Inſtitutions had their <hi>Baſis</hi> in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> practices, and with ſome variation from the Original, were conſecrated to ſerve the purpoſes of Chriſtianity, and that by unqueſtionable Authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:65847:149"/>By ſuch Authority one is juſtified in aſcribing to Eccleſiaſtical Officers the Title of <hi>Prieſts</hi>; for it may ſeem, that they were oppoſers of ſuch as did bear it, who are ſaid by S. <hi>Jude</hi> to have periſh'd in the gainſaying of <hi>Core,</hi> ver. 11.

               <p>But this State of Affairs did not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue: Another <hi>prudential reaſon</hi> appears to juſtle out the former, and introduces ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſtep to corruption:</hi> For <hi>it was found by experience,</hi> you ſay, <hi>that the eldeſt was not always the worthieſt and fitteſt for the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of matters.</hi> A very notable diſcovery!

It alſo ſeems incredible, that the

old men ſhould be ſo eaſily degraded from their accuſtomed precedence and ſuffer their juniors to be pearcht into their places. They muſt be ſuppos'd to be perſons of a very complaiſant humour, tho they had no great proportions of <hi>Mother-Wit,</hi> ſeeing they would yield up their Title and Dignity of firſt Presbyters without the leaſt murmur or complaint. But that's no matter, Once up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a time, all the world over, <hi>it came to paſs that the place devolv'd not by ſeniority but was confer'd by Election made by all the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and not unlikely but with Prayer and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands.</hi> Things very piouſly reckon'd amongſt the means of depraving the Inſtitution of Chriſt! And now the firſt Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter by this new Ordination begins to look pretty like a Biſhop, <hi>yet he had no more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the College of Presbyters than is by all Proteſtants allow'd to</hi> Peter <hi>in that of the Apoſtles.</hi> But one ſtep more brings him to the Epiſcopal Throne.

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:65847:151"/>
of the number of thoſe that labour'd in the Word.</hi> And I make no queſtion, but here you have put together ſeveral things that might better have been omitted.

               <p>You have ſome other quotations from the Fathers which I need not here examine, having done it already. But I proceed to ſhew, that it is altogether improbable that the Paſtours of the Church, who came next after the Apoſtles, ſhould conſpire to deprave a Divine Inſtitution. And this, I think will appear, if it be conſider'd, 1. That they were perſons of admirable Holineſs and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. 2. If they had not been ſuch, they could not ſo ſuddenly have agreed in the ſame deſign, to corrupt the Church, as you contend, in the ſame manner.</p>

And can we imagine that ſuch perſons as theſe conſpir'd to deprave an Inſtitution of Chriſt?

Was there not one upon earth that would oppoſe their Innovations, or plainly tell them, that by the appointment of Heaven all Presbyters are equal? If the Presbyters had no regard for their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, had they no concern for their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters glory?

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:65847:157"/>
if it were of force againſt any; For <hi>Fob Traditions,</hi> as you call them, have <hi>paſs'd for current</hi> amongſt ſome in every Age ſince the days of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Tertullian</hi> himſelf, you think, was one that tranſmitted ſuch Traditions to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, and particularly you are offended at him for reporting that the Apoſtles had <hi>Chairs in particular Churches:</hi> And yet you are not ſure, that this ought to be laid to his Charge. Only, you tell me, <hi>his words at firſt ſight may ſeem to ſound that way.</hi> A notable way of confuting the Fathers, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the ſenſe of one of them, and that not certain neither, but taken from his words, as <hi>at firſt ſight they ſeem to ſound.</hi> One might have expected, that you ſhould have ſpent a thought or two more about them, before you paſs'd your Cenſure on them, or reckon'd the Author amongſt the Fabulous Writers, and made him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Partiality or Impoſtures of the Ancients.</p>
               <p>For my part, I think he meant by Chairs, what you ſo quickly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the firſt glance, and that Biſhops ſate in the Material <hi>Seats</hi> of the Apoſtles in the Adminiſtration of the Government. And yet I ſee nothing in this that is incredible. It is neither contrary to the Faith of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:65847:157"/>
nor without Example in it. Nor is it improbable, that before Adoration was pay'd to <hi>Reliques,</hi> the <hi>Chairs</hi> of the Apoſtles ſhould be preſerv'd about a hundred years. Sure I am, that he might better judge of ſuch a matter of Fact, than we can at this time. And I know not, why this word may not as well be accepted when he diſcourſes of theſe <hi>Chairs,</hi> as when he adds <note n="(e)" place="margin">Percurre Eccleſias Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicas, apud quas ipſae ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huc Cathedrae Apoſtolorum ſuis locis praeſident, apud quas ipſae Authenticae Literae corum recitantur. <hi>Tert. de Praeſcript. c. 36. p. 215.</hi>
                  </note>, That the <hi>Authentick Letters of the Apoſtles</hi> were read in the Apoſtolick Churches.</p>
               <p>But whatever he meant by the <hi>Chairs,</hi> 'tis plain enough, he thought, the Biſhops were the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles in particular Dioceſes or Churches:<note place="margin">P. 49.</note> And if you can <hi>no more believe this, than the Story of the Cells of the Seventy Interpreters, though</hi> Juſtin Martyr <hi>affirms, that he ſaw the Ruines of thoſe very Cells, and that they were in the</hi> Pharos <hi>of</hi> Alexandria, I cannot help it. Nor do I think it neceſſary to enter into a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute about the truth or falſhood of <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s Relation. But ſince that which he ſays of thoſe <hi>Cells</hi> depends on the Credit of ſome unknown <hi>Alexandrians</hi>; ſince they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to have been built in the <hi>Pharos</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:65847:158"/>
and that about four hundred years before he writ his <hi>Paraeneſis</hi> to the <hi>Greeks:</hi> And ſince the Tradition which he hath convey'd to us about them, was not univerſally receiv'd, but was with ſome diſdain rejected by S. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi> the moſt Learned Critick of his Age; it was not, in any of theſe reſpects, parallel to the Account which I have given from <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> and others, concerning the Original of Biſhops; nor is there any ſuch Connexion between them, as that they muſt ſtand or fall together.</p>
               <p>There is ſuch clear evidence, that the Churches were govern'd by Biſhops in the beginning of the Second Century, that it hath extorted a Confeſſion from the moſt Learned Adverſaries: And if we had never been told, that they were conſtituted by the Apoſtles or Apoſtolical Perſons, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd their Power by Succeſſion from them, the thing had notwithſtanding been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. But there is not the leaſt reaſon to doubt of it, when we find it ſo univerſally believ'd by the Ancient Church: and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly when <hi>Tertullian</hi> aſſerts it in ſuch a manner, as he does, and urges it with ſo much aſſurance againſt the Hereticks. For if he had no grounds for it, I ſhould not ſay that he was <hi>tainted with partial humours and framed matters according to his own conceit,</hi>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:65847:158"/>
but that he was void of common ſenſe; and as extravagant, as a Proteſtant would be at this day, if, to confute the Exceptions of Papiſts againſt the meanneſs of ſome of the firſt Reformers, he ſhould affirm with great confidence, and inſiſt on it as a thing too notorious to be deny'd, that <hi>Calvin</hi> ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Peter de la Baume</hi> in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and that <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancthon</hi> were Spiritual Princes of the Empire, and Electors of <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are now almoſt at twice the diſtance from the beginning of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Reformation, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> was from the days of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: And we are more remote from the coming of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> than <hi>Irenaeus</hi> was from the death of S. <hi>John,</hi> when he argued againſt the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinians</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the Succeſſion of Biſhops to the Apoſtles, in the Government of the Churches. And what he ſaid of it muſt then have appear'd either ſo palpably falſe, that it would have expos'd him and his Cauſe to deriſion, or ſo evidently true, that your Exceptions againſt it, would at that time, have been to the ſame effect, as if a Diſſenter ſhould now declare. That the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts had in this laſt Age introduced ſeveral Corruptions into the Church, and Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy amongſt the reſt; That in the Reign
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65847:159"/>
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> all the Miniſters in the Kingdom were equal, but after her deceaſe the <hi>Defection</hi> began, and was afterwards gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually carried on till the Prelats arriv'd at their preſent Greatneſs. That one <hi>need but ſome Experience in the uſe of things, and a little proportion of mother wit</hi> to diſcover this, and to <hi>make a clear and diſtinct conception of it</hi>; That however the Biſhops might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that they had Predeceſſors in the laſt Century, and produce for it the Teſtimony of many Authors, yet thoſe Authors were <hi>tainted with partial humours,</hi> and there were <hi>Fob Traditions paſſed for current in their time,</hi> ſo that we are under no obligation to believe them. And now, Sir, I leave you to judge, whether a perſon that ſhould diſcourſe ſeriouſly in ſuch a manner, were fit to be argued with, or to be managed another way, according to the Rules of Art.</p>
               <p>You have another Bold Stroke yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, which is <note n="†" place="margin">

               <p>It is not any want of clearneſs or ſtrength in the Teſtimony, which the Fathers give concerning the Original of Epiſcopacy, that drew from you the odious Reflections which you caſt on them; but the force there is in it to demonſtrate, that the Strokes and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments of your <hi>Scheme</hi> of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are meerly the work of Fancy, and that you have employ'd your Pen in the ſervice of a bad Cauſe.

For example, <hi>Gittichius</hi> ſays <note n="(c)" place="margin">Vid. Git<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tich. Ep. ad Ruar. ad cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem. Epp. Ruar. Cent. <hi>1. p. 469, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note>, that his Friends, who had read their Books, found them plunged into the profoundeſt ignorance, hardly underſtanding ſo much as one Article of the Chriſtian Faith, but, like blind men, moving irregularly, and with a trembling pace. And ſuch confidence he had, that the Cenſures which his party had paſs'd on them were juſt, or rather too modeſt, that he declares, The Truth of the Chriſtian Religion was wholly loſt a little after the death of the Apoſtles, and commends <hi>Flaccius Illyricus,</hi> for comparing the Diſputations of the Fathers to a Fight of Drunkards at a Feaſt, who are not ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to betake themſelves to their Swords, but ſupply the want of Weapons with Diſhes or Trenchers, with Bread, or any thing that comes to hand. Yet his Friends ſometimes make uſe of the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

of thoſe whom he ſo impudently charges with Apoſtaſie and Folly, and whom they are wont to reproach; and they depend on it in matters of great importance. They prove from thence in the <hi>Racovian</hi> Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, that our Lord roſe from the dead, as the Scriptures relate, and that the ſeveral Books of the New Teſtament were written by the Perſons whoſe Names they bear, herein following the Example of their Maſter <hi>Socinus</hi>

                  </note>, who argues from the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conſent of the Primitive Chriſtians, that the four <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels,</hi> the <hi>Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, &amp;c.</hi> were written by thoſe to whom they are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted: and for this, he refers us to <hi>Euſebius.</hi> At other times he treated the Ancients with great contempt, becauſe they ſtood in the way of this <hi>Animal of Glory,</hi> when he was reſolv'd to make himſelf the Head of a Sect: yet he plainly ſhews, that for the vindication of the Authority of the Holy Scripture an aſſent is neceſſary and due to their Suffrage. And others, who aſcribe very little to that Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, cannot but perceive, if they will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively conſider it, that when there is a diſpute about ſome paſſages or parts of the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:65847:163"/>
Holy Scripture, whether they are genuine or not, one would render himſelf extreamly ridiculous, that ſhould reject the Teſtimony of the Fathers as uſeleſs on this occaſion, and go about to determine the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, and to convince gainſayers by his own Inſtinct, or the dictates of a private Spirit.</p>
               <p>But if, immediately after the Apoſtles deceaſe, there was a general departure from that Rule of Government which they appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; if all the Primitive Biſhops were U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers of the Rights of thoſe whom Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had made their Equals, and all the Presbyters upon Earth did tamely abandon that Power which God had given them, and all the Chriſtians in the World with one Conſent approv'd and promoted the evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the former, and the treachery of the laſt; and if we muſt believe that the Primitive Writers conſpir'd to put a Cheat upon us, in the Repreſentations they have made of the Affairs of the Church, I would then be inform'd, what aſſurance we can have, that they have convey'd to us the true <hi>Canon</hi> of Scripture: For it may ſeem, that if they were Men ſo extreamly Corrupt, they deſerv'd no great Credit in any thing, and might be ſuſpected to have made as bold with the <hi>Oracles</hi> of God, as
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:65847:164"/>
they had done with his Inſtitution of <hi>Church-Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I make no doubt to affirm, that the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Fathers is at leaſt as cogent for the Divine Original of Epiſcopacy, as it is when they aſcertain to us the Canon of Scripture; which yet is like to ſuffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by this compariſon. For if we reject them as falſe Witneſſes when they inform us, that Biſhops were appointed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, we muſt not only believe, as I have intimated already, that the Paſtors of the Church, notwithſtanding their great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from one another, and their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Cuſtoms and Intereſts, generally hit, at the ſame time, upon the ſame Project, to deſtroy that Eccleſiaſtical Polity, which had Chriſt for its Founder; but that every where they had the ſame fatal Succeſs. We muſt alſo believe, that however Government is a very nice thing, and is not uſually chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged without fears, and jealouſies, and mighty clamours; and however the alterations of the Forms of Government are ſo eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, yet did the Riſing Prelates give ſo dextrous and nimble a Turn to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, over all the World, that that there was not the leaſt notice taken of it; or elſe we muſt believe, that they deſtroy'd all the Records of that Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:65847:164"/>
ſo that no Monuments remain of their Ambition. And this we muſt alſo believe againſt the declarations of thoſe that were converſant with the Apoſtles, and their immediate Succeſſors; againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations of Martyrs and Confeſſors in the beſt and pureſt times; and againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faith of Chriſtians for above a thouſand years after the death of our Saviour. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus Credulous, we ſhall much reſemble one <hi>Vilgardus</hi> of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> mention'd by <hi>Glaber Rodulphus,</hi> who aſſerted,<note place="margin">Apud uſſer. in lib. de Succeſ.

                  </note> that all the ſayings of the Poets ought in every point to be believ'd. And when we are arriv'd at that pitch of ſenſe, no body, I ſuppoſe, will be much concern'd at what we contradict, or care to diſpute with us, who are only fit for the Entertainments of <hi>Inchanted Caſtles.</hi>
