            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE CHILDREN OF THE REFORMATION.</head>
            <p>BE not concern'd to know whoſe hand it is which holds the link, but follow the light it gives: reach your hand to receive this Treatiſe, which marks the shore, where the <hi>Ark</hi> of our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, shatter'd by a deluge of troubles, may reſt; which is a Holy liberty to all and each Perſon to believe or not believe; act or not act, as he pleaſes with a ſafe conſcience acording the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Reformation. We generally lament the convulſions which shake our Church and State, through the diverſity of opinions, profeſſed by our ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations; ſom remedies have bin ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to bring vs to Peace and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; but all have proved ineffectual: ſom of our Drs judge, nothing can cure our diſeaſe, but a General Council or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority, to whoſe ſentence we should all ſubmit; but this, beſides that it is Popish, to grant any human Power for to oblige our conſciences againſt
<pb facs="tcp:31540:3"/>
our jugdments in matters of Religion; is but an imaginary remedy for a real Evil: for, it's not in the Reformation as in Popery; in this there is a ſupream Authority for to convene the Paſtors of diverſe Kingdoms to a general Council; in our Reformation there is none: Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery believes its Councils and Popes <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi>; and therefore they cannot but acquieſce, becauſe an infallible ſentence leaves no doubt of the Truth; but in the Reformation, all Councils and human Authority are <hi>fallible</hi>; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Deciſions may be doubted of, and we are never certain of the Truth.</p>
            <p>Others judge, the remedy of our diſeaſe can be no other, but Pills of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, penal laws, Acts of Parliament, Ordinances of Synods, forcing men to conformity; but this has proved not only deſtructive to the peace of the Church, but has shockt the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our Reformation: for if we muſt believe under ſevere penalties what the State and Eccleſiaſtical Authority will have vs believe; then ſcripture muſt be no more our Rule of faith, but the ſtate and Church, which tells me what I muſt believe; and we muſt be deprived of the right and power of interpreting
<pb facs="tcp:31540:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Scripture and believing it in the ſenſe we think it to be the true; and yet our whole Reformation is cemented and was firſt raiſed vpon this Holy Libertie; That every one should reade Scripture, interpret it, and believe whatever he thought was the true ſenſe of it; without any compulſion or conſtraint for to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve either Church, State, Univerſitie or Dr. if wee did not judge by Scripture his Doctrin was true.</p>
            <p>If Prudence had as great a ſhare in our Conduct, as Paſſion, wee ſhould regulat our future by the effects of our paſt actions; and if wee will caſt an eye back to the tranſactions of later years, we will find this compulſion of Mens Conſciences has produced but confuſion in our Church, and fatal diſturbances in our State; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe, never did our Reformation enjoy more peace, ſhin'd with more luſtre, and held its courſe with more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, than when none was moleſted for his Profeſſion, but euery one had libertie to believe and teach, what Doctrin and ſenſe each one thought to be the moſt conformable to Scripture. Confider the infancy of the Reformation, when God raiſed Luther to repair the ruins of the Church; how of a ſuddain it ſpred it ſelf
<pb facs="tcp:31540:4"/>
in Germany, France, Holland, Poland, Scotland and England, and by what means? was it not by takeing away all conſtraint of mens Conſciences (vſed then only in the Popish Church) our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Reformers takeing to themſelves and giving to others, a Holy libertie for to teach and believe what ever they judged to be the Doctrin and true Senſe of Scripture, tho it ſhould be againſt the received opinion of the Councils, Church, Univerſities and Drs.? look into the Reign of Edward the VI. then, did our Reformation florish in England; and was miraculouſly propagated by the Liberty of Martin Bucer, Cranmer, Ochinus, Peter Martyr and others in teaching Calviniſm, Lutheraniſm, Zuinglianiſm by Scripture as every one vnderſtood it: Deſcend to the reing of Queen Marie; then, the light of the Ghoſpel was eclypſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe the flock was again popishly compelled to believe, not what they judged by Scripture to be true; but what the Pope and Church judged was ſuch: Com down a ſtep lower to Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths time; then, the flock recouering that holy liberty for to believe what each one thought was the Doctrin of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the Reformation gained ground;
<pb facs="tcp:31540:4"/>
our ſeveral Congregations lived peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; for tho Proteſtancy was eſtablisht the Religion of the Land; others were not oppreſſed, nor their liberty conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by compulſions: ſtep down a degree lower to king James his time; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation held its courſe as proſperouſſy as in Queen Elizabeths time, becauſe mens conſciences were not oppreſſed; all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Brethren had full libertie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as they pleaſed; tho Proteſtancy was the Religion of the King: look down a ſtep lower to king Charles the firſt's reign; his Matie carried with a godly zeale of reſtraining the diverſity of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, begot by the liberty enjoyed in his Predeceſſors times, would by new Laws and Ordinances force the flock to an Uniformity of Doctrin, but our zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Brethren the Preſbyterians, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of any conſtraint in affairs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and pleading for the Evangelical Libetty of our Reformation, for to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing, nor vſe any Rites or Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies but as each one judged by Scripture to be convenient; they cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted againſt his Majeſtie and Bishops; and the ſtorm grew to that height, that both Church and ſtate were drown'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the blood of our Reformed

               </gap> vpon a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and new ſettlement of Gouvernment and Religion, to follow the footſteps of our firſt renowned Reformers: to enact that there may be no other Rule of faith, but that which we received from our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and which is laid down for vs in the 39 Articles of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: that is, Scripture as each one beſt vnderſtands it, without regarding the judgment, ſenſe, or interpretation of any
<pb facs="tcp:31540:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but the pure <hi>Word of God,</hi> as we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it: and to enact Penal Laws againſt any ſo bold and vncharitable, as to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or blame the Tenets of any Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, be it Lutheraniſm, Preſbyterie, Arianiſm, Judaiſm or Paganiſm: or any Doctrin whatever, that any man of ſound judgment thinks in his conſcience to be the ſenſe and Doctrin of Scripture.</p>
            <p>Three things make me hope, that this Treatiſe will be wellcom to the well inclined and pious Reader of our Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church: firſt, that there is not one author quoted in this booke, but our own Doctors, learned and godly Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Reformation; and this J obſerve, that my Reader may know ther's not a Jot of any Doctrin heer but what is of the Reformation; and alſo advertiſe our Writers and Schoole men, how much, they diſcredit our Reformed Church, by makeing ſo much vſe of Popish Drs and Bookes in their Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; as if wee had not great and learned men of our own; if wee looke into our Bishops and Miniſters libraries; wee ſhall meet but books either of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly Papiſts, or ſtrongly ſuſpected of Popery; and you ſhall hardly meete
<pb facs="tcp:31540:8"/>
in any of them, the works of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rher, Calvin, Beza, or any of our own authors, if you do not meet ſom Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or Romances: if you reade our Modern Writers, you ſhall find their bookes to be ſtuft with arguments ſtolen from Stapleton, Peron, Bellarmin, and other Popish Drs. wheras they ought to take their Doctrin from Luther, Calvin and our other firſt Reformers, Apoſtles raiſed by Gods heavenly Spirit; Oracles by whoſe mouths and pens he delivered the pure and Orthodox Doctrin of the Ghoſpel; heavenly Fontains, from which wee ought to drink the Doctrin of the Reformation: therefore, J have made a particular ſtudy, for the comfort of my Reader, not to profane this Treatiſe with any quotation of any Popish Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, none but our own Drs.</p>
            <p>Secondly my Reader will be pleaſed with this Treatiſe, becauſe J do not oblige him to believe the contents of it: if he miſlikes any Doctrin couched in this booke, let him not believe it; if he likes it, let him believe it; what J pretend is, to maintain his libertie for to believe or not believe what he pleaſe and that none can ſay black in his eye,
<pb facs="tcp:31540:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for believing whatever he judges to be the ſenſe of Scripture; let all others think of it what they will; for, our Rule of faith, as J will prove, being Scripture as each Perſon vnderſtands it, who can be ſo bold as to check you for teaching and believing what you vnderſtand ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay? ſom Doctrins there are in this booke delivered by Luther, Calvin, Zuinglius, Beza, and others; which our Church of England and ſom others do call blaſphemies, and ſcandalous Tenets; and their irreverence and arrogance is run ſo farr: as to condemn thoſe bleſſed men, for teaching ſuch Tenets, and ſay that they ſwerved from the truth; and had their fraileties, in ſo much, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of vs are ashamed to own thoſe great men to have been our Reformers and leaders: this is an impiety altogither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable, it cannot be ſuffered with patience, that ſuch Apoſtolical men, who were vndeniably our firſt Maſters of the Reformation, ſhould be ſo vilified and abuſed: therefore J do prove, that ther's no Doctrin delivered by them, but is to be eſteemed and called the Doctrin of the Reformation: and can be according the Principles of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb facs="tcp:31540:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Church, believed and taught by any Reformed Child: for what is our <hi>Rule of faith</hi> in the Reformation, but Scripture as each Perſon of ſound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vndeſtands it? conſequently what is the <hi>Doctrin</hi> of the Reformation, but what any Perſon of ſound judgment vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands to be of Scripture: whatever Doctrin therefore, Luther, Calvin, or others judged to be of Scripture: how can you deny it to be the Doctrin of the Reformation: or blame them for teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and believing it? if you do not like it: the moſt, you can in juſtice do, is not to believe it: but you cannot juſtly ſay its not the Doctrin of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, becauſe it's Scripture as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by Perſons of good judgment: nor can you in juſtice blame them, or any other for believing it, if they like it: for, muſt not wee believe, what wee judge in our conſcience to be the Doctrin of Scripture?</p>
            <p>Laſtly my Reader will be pleaſed with the ſincerity and plain dealing of this Treatiſe: as much as wee are all offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the diſſimulation and double deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Modern Writers, whoſe aim and ſcope in the bookes they give out

Church, and judge in his conſcience that interpretation and Doctrin to be true: conſequently he may with a ſafe conſcience profeſs that Religion; ſoon after he may meet Calvins bookes, &amp; charm'd with the admirable ſtrength of his reaſons and gloſſes vpon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he may judge in his conſcience, he is to be preferr'd beforre Luther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo may lawfully forſake Luthera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm for Calviniſm; then again he hits vpon Scripture as interpreted by the Church of England, whoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin raviſh's him with that decencie of Ceremonies, that majeſty of her ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie, that harmonie of her Hiera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherin can you ſay does this man tranſgreſs againſt the Doctrin or principles of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Does he forſake the Reformation becauſe he forſakes Lutheraniſm for Calviniſm? No ſure; for Calviniſm is as much of the Reformation as the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31540:15"/>
other: Is not Proteſtancy as much the Doctrin of the Reformation as Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie? tho he changes therefore one for the other, he ſtill holds the Doctrin of the Reformation: Is not the Doctrin of the Reformation Scripture, not as Proteſtants onely, or Presbyterians onely interpret it, but as any Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or man of ſound judgment holds it? It is therefore evident that according the Doctrin and principles of the Reformation, he may with a ſafe conſcience change Religions, and be to day of one, to morrow of an other vntill he runs all ouer. Point me out any Congregation (the obſtinat Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts excepted) who will dare ſay, I cannot live with a ſafe conſcience in any other Congregation but in it ſelf; all other Congregations will laugh at it; Why then may not I lawfully for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake any Congregation, and paſs to an other?

Did Luther and Calvin forſake the Pope and Councils, for to ſubmit their judgments to any other?

               <p>And now let me anſwer to an objection you made againſt this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in our entrance to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: you objected that many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Drs and <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> delivered ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and baſe Doctrins, which the Papiſts will not admit to be the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of their Church, tho deliverd by Papish Drs; and thence you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:31540:30"/>
that the particular ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of privat Drs of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not to be called the Doctrin of our Church. But be pleaſed to obſerve the difference betwixt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and our Reformation; the Rule of faith in Popery is, Scripture as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by the Pope and Council, or their Church; they will admit no other; conſequently no Doctrin is to be called Popery but what is judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Pope and his Church or Council to be the ſenſe of Scripture; and if any Dr or Univerſitie holds any ſenſe contrary to theirs; it is to be called the Doctrin of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon, and not the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the Popish Church; becauſe their Rule of faith is not Scripture as interpreted by any Perſon of ſound judgment; but as interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their Pope and Council. But wheras our Rule of faith in the Reformation, is Scripture as each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſound judgment interprets it; whatever Doctrin or ſenſe is ſaid by any man to be of Scripture, is juſtly to be called the Doctrin of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: for example, Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton, a man of ſound judgment,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:31540:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great learning, and of an vpright conſcience, taught Bigamy to be the Doctrin of ſcripture; Beza taught, the Lords ſupper might be adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd in any kind of victuals, as well as in bread and wine: Calvin taught, that Chriſt deſpaired on the Croſs, and ſuffered the pains of hell after his death: why then, let all the Bishops and Univerſities of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland condemn this Doctrin; let all the Synods of France and Germany decry it; the Doctrin will be ſtill of the Reformation; becauſe its Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as interpreted by men of ſound judgment.</p>

               <p>This is a ticklish point; let's leaue it to the conſideration of our wiſe and prudent Parliament; and be pleaſed to anſwer to my doubt; how can wee live in peace and tranquillitie in Religion, if our Rule of faith be Scripture as each one vnderſtands it: I remember a diſcourſe ſtarted in the houſe of Lords, not many yeares agon, by his Grace the Duke of <hi>Buckingam</hi>; he deſired to know, what was it to be a Proteſtant; wherin did Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:31540:36"/>
properly conſiſt? the Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, who were preſent looked one vpon an other, and whether, they feared the difficultie of the queſtion, or that for modeſty's ſake, each ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to hear an other ſpeake firſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> they ſtood ſylent for a whyle; at laſt the yce was broken by one; others followed; but hardly any two agreed; and all that the Duke could gather out of their ſeveral anſwers, was that our Rule of faith, was Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as each one vndeſtood it; and Proteſtancy nothing but Scripture as interpreted by the Parliament and Church of England: whervpon he concluded, Wee are theſe hundred yeares very buſy for to ſettle Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and for ought I perceive, wee are as vnſettled now as at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: And truly he had great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for, Religion and faith is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but that ſenſe of Scripture, which each Perſon of ſound judgment vnderſtands; and as it's impoſſible wee ſhould all jump and agree in one ſenſe and meaning of the text, ſo its impoſſible wee ſhall euer be ſettled and agree in Religion.</p>

               <p>The reaſon of our vnſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement hitherto and at preſent, is the violent efforts, what by perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, Acts of Parliaments, and other oppreſſions; what by Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives, intrigues, and cabals of the Church of England, to draw all to be Proteſtants; of the Preſbyterians, to make vs deny Epiſcopacy; and of each other Congregation, to force vs to their reſpective Tenets: and whylſt this conſtraint and ſeverity is vſed againſt mens conſciences, its in vain to expect peace or ſettlement in our Reformed Church: but let vs follow our Rule of faith; let cach one believe as in his conſcience he beſt vnderſtands Scripture; let vs all believe what wee pleaſe, and be permitted ſo to do; and wee ſhall without doubt enjoy perfect peace and Tranquillity: believe you <hi>Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Preſence,</hi> if you will; let the Lutheran believe his <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> if he likes it; and let me believe <hi>no Preſence</hi> at all, if I judge ther's none; why will not you permit me to follow that Rule of faith which the whole Reformation, euen the Church

what each one thinks in his own conſcience to be ſuch; becauſe even now at preſent, our Rule of faith, is Scripture as each perſon of ſound judgment vnderſtands it, and this is the ſame Rule which Luther and the Reformation in its beginning had: this holy libertie is the beſt iewel, the greateſt perfection, and moſt glorious prerogative the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has: if therefore now at preſent any man judges by ſcripture, that he can marry ten wyves at a time; that he can kill his owne ſon as Abraham intended; that he may commit inceſt with his own Daughter, as Lot did; that there is no ſin but incredulity, as Luther believed; nor any Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Trinitie of Perſons in one nature, as Calvin believed: with what juſtice can the Church of England ſay a man does not believe and live as becometh a Reformed Child, or that his Doctrin and life is ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous? wheras he lives and believes as he vnderſtands by Scripture he may or ought to do, which is the Rule of faith of the Reformation, even of the Church of England? the Church
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:31540:51"/>
of England ſaies, the Lutheran Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of the real Preſence, is not the Doctrin of Scripture; that the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Doctrin againſt Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, is not the Doctrin of Scripture; that the Anabaptiſt Doctrin againſt infants Baptiſm, is not of Scripture; and yet you permit them all to live in peace; you confeſs they are true Children of the Reformation, tho diſſenters from you; why? becauſe they follow Scripture as they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, and this is our Rule of faith: and why will not you ſay, the belief and life of that other man is alſo of the Reformation, tho abſurd it may ſeem to you; ſince he believes and lives as he judges by Scripture he may: it follows therefore plainly that this is the Doctrin of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>

               <p>As to your preſent doubt J anſwer, its the Doctrine of the Reformation, that it was Jeſus Chriſt the ſon of God who eſtablisht the Church; you may believe it therefore: It's alſo the Doctrin of the Reformation, that it was not Jeſus Chriſt the ſon of God who eſtablisht the Church: that this is the Doctrin of our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion its apparent; for its Scripture as interpreted by Ochinus a man of ſound judgment, <hi>whom all Italy could not match,</hi> ſaies Calvin; <hi>in whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence England was happy, and vnhappy in his abſence,</hi> ſaies B Bale: Ochinus ſpeakes thus, <note n="a" place="margin">In Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat.

of God, becauſe he wanted prouidence</hi>; and vpon this reflexion he renounced Chriſt and became a Jew: And no man can ſay but that he acted and behaued himſelf like a true Child of the Reformation in ſo doing; for he followed ſcripture as he vnderſtood it; and as he was a true Reformed Child in forſaking Popery, becauſe he vnderſtood by Scripture, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was better; ſo ſince he vnderſtood by reading Scripture more, that Judaiſm was better than the Reformation, he acted like a good Reformed, in choſing that which he vnderſtood by Scripture to be the beſt: this is the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Rule of faith: do you, if you pleaſe, as he did, and you'l be as good a Reformed as he.</p>
               <p>And if you chooſe to believe that there is a Church eſtablisht on earth by Chriſt, you muſt beware never to believe or perſwade yourſelf that wee are bound to believe her Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, or live in her, if you do not judge by ſcripture that ſhe teachs the Doctrin of Chriſt: This is the moſt eſſential point of Popery; An obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation

I grant, there ought to be a reſpect for the judgment and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Text, given by the Primitive Church and Fathers; but if a Doctor, or man of ſound judgment, replenisht with Gods Spirit, reades Scripture with an humble heart, and pure intention, and judges by it, that Bygamy is
