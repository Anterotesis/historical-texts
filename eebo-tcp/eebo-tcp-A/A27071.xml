            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SUNDAY, the 12th of <hi>February,</hi> 1692. about ten a Clock at Night, an Expreſs from Lieut. Colonel <hi>Beecknam</hi> of <hi>

Inſtant an Hour before Day, ready to fall upon the two firſt Caſtles of the <hi>Mohaques.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon His Excellency ordered the Col. of the Militia of the City of <hi>New-York</hi> to draw out his Regiment the next Morning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> the 13th, Orders were ſent to Col. <hi>Courtland</hi> of <hi>Kings-County,</hi> to detach out of their Regiments a hundred and fifty Men, to be forth-with ready to Imbarque at the Ferry.</p>
            <p>About eight a Clock in the Morning the City Regiment being under Arms, his Excellency on Horſe-back, at the head of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, demanded, <hi>Who were willing to follow him to the Frontiers againſt the Enemy?</hi> They unanimouſly threw up their Hats, and cryed, <hi>One and all.</hi> Upon which the Colonel was ordered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach 150 of the fitteſt Men, to be under the Command of three Captains, with their Subalterns, ready at the firſt Beat of Drum, and diſmiſſed the Regiment, and ordered all Sloops for Tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to be ſecured.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> together in readineſs, to carry his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and the Detachments from <hi>Kingſtone</hi> to <hi>Albany</hi> by Land, in caſe the River was not open, and to forward any Confirmation of the News to his Excellency.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 14th, by break of Day came an Expreſs from Major <hi>Ingoldsby,</hi> confirming the former News, and that the two firſt Caſtles were taken by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi> Whereupon eight Sloops were ordered with neceſſary Proviſions and Ammunition to go round the Fort, and to be ready to Sail, and the Detachment of the City Regiment did immediately Imbarque. About four a Clock afternooon, the Tide offering, his Excellency, attended with the Officers of the Detachment and ſeveral Volunteers, did imbarque and ſet ſail.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> the 17th, about 9 a Clock his Excellency arrived at <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> (being 50 Leagues diſtant from <hi>New-York</hi>) with five of the Sloops, having met with much Ice in the River, which gave ſome Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the reſt arrived towards Evening.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they came on Shore, his Excellency ordered Captain <hi>Schuyler</hi> to march 50 of the Men for <hi>Schenectady</hi>; about a 11 a Clock his Exellency followed, with 16 Horſe, leaving Inſtructions with Col. <hi>Beyard</hi> to forward all the reſt of the Detachments, as they did arrive towards <hi>Schenectady,</hi> without loſs of time, together with the Ammunition and Proviſions.</p>
            <p>About 3 a Clock afternoon his Excellency met Major <hi>Ingoldsby,</hi> about 8 Miles from <hi>Schenectady,</hi> on his Return from <hi>Albany,</hi> having gone from thence to viſit <hi>Schenectady</hi> that Morning.

The Horſes being carried over the River, and the Men ready to be tranſported, came an Expreſs from Major <hi>Schuyler,</hi> giving Intelligence of his being near at hand on his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, who arrived about 4 a Clock afternoon, upon which the Men and Horſe were remanded, and ſent back to their own Home. There marched by his Excellency's Order, to joyn Major <hi>Schuyler,</hi> ſince his Arrival 208 effective Men, beſides Guides and Carriers of Supplies, with conſiderable quantities of Proviſions and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are ſince returned.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> the 8th, being <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> about 2 a Clock afternoon, we had the Alarm from <hi>Schenectady,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> had taken the <hi>Mohaques</hi> Caſtles; ſoon after we had the News, that a Young-man, called <hi>Jan Baptiſt van Eps,</hi> (taken at <hi>Schenecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> 3 Years ago) was run over from the <hi>French,</hi> as they were to

attack the firſt Caſtle of the <hi>Mohaques,</hi> and come to <hi>Schenectady,</hi> who related, that the <hi>French</hi> were 350 <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and 200 <hi>Indians.</hi> Major <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> ſent forth-with his Warrants, to command in the Farmers of Capt. <hi>Genits</hi> and Capt. <hi>Tunis</hi>'s Companies of Militia. This Night Lieut. <hi>John Schuyler</hi> and <hi>Cornet Abeel</hi> with 55 Horſe, marched to <hi>Schenectady.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> 9. <hi>Cornet Abeel</hi> came expreſs from <hi>Schenectady,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that Major <hi>Schuyler</hi> or Major <hi>Weſſels</hi> might be ſent thither to pacifie the <hi>Indians,</hi> who were enraged that no <hi>Chriſtians</hi> went out in purſuit of the Enemy. Upon which Major <hi>Schuyler</hi> at his own Requeſt was permitted to go that Evening. As ſoon as Major <hi>Schuyler</hi> arrived there, he ſent out Scouts to ſpy the Forts and the Enemies Motion, and withal to go and warn the <hi>Tionondoge Indians</hi> of the Enemies coming, but they having gone 12 Miles, returned about 12 a Clock at Night, ſaying, they could not get over the River.</p>
            <p>

Major <hi>Schuyler</hi> ſent Lieut. <hi>John Schuyler</hi> and Lieut. <hi>John Sanders,</hi> and ſix more to view the <hi>Mohaques</hi> Fort that was poſſeſſed by the Enemy, who brought News, that the <hi>French</hi> were in both the Forts; of all which he gave advice to Major <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> at <hi>Albany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 11. Major <hi>Schuyler</hi> ſent 10 <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and 40 <hi>Indians</hi> to lie near the Enemy, and to watch their Motion, who made a ſmall Fort to retreat into, and ſo ſpyed what the Enemy did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 12. News was brought to <hi>Schenectady</hi> by ſome of the ſaid Scouts, that they had heard firing at the <hi>Mohaques</hi> Forts, which was ſuppoſed the <hi>Tionondoge Indians</hi> againſt the <hi>French</hi>; which News Major <hi>Schuyler</hi> ſent forward to <hi>Albany.</hi> Whereupon Major <hi>Ingolds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> detached about 200 Men out of the ſeveral Companies of the Militia Fuzileers and Troop, commanded by Capt. <hi>Peter Matthews,</hi> Capt. <hi>Arent Schuyler,</hi> Capt. <hi>Benj. Phips,</hi> Capt. <hi>Kihad van Renſlaer,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Tho. Gartin,</hi> who arrived at <hi>Schenectady</hi> about 2 a Clock afternoon, and joyned Major <hi>Schuyler:</hi> The Waggons with Bread arrived that Night. This day our Scouts brought us the News, that the <hi>French</hi> were there ſtill, and that they had alſo cut off the third Caſtle of the <hi>Mohaques,</hi> called, <hi>Tionondoge,</hi> and that none of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52521:6"/>
the upper <hi>Indians</hi> were come down; all which was advertiſed to Major <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> forthwith, and Major <hi>Schuyler</hi> ſent to him for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to march.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 13. This Morning having received no anſwer of the ſaid Expreſs, Major <hi>Schuyler</hi> ſent another to march, and being preſſed with the <hi>Indians,</hi> who threatned elſe to deſert us, was forced to march the Men over the River without Orders, which came about 4 a Clock in the Afternoon, when moſt of the Men were got over the River. This very time we had News by our out Scouts, that the <hi>French</hi> had burnt the <hi>Mohaques</hi> three Caſtles, and were marched away, which Major <hi>Schuyler</hi> ordered Lieut. <hi>Young</hi> to ſignifie to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Ingoldsby.</hi> We marched 12 Miles that Evening, being 273 <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> In the Night about 10 a Clock one of our Scouts came in, and told us that 600 of our uppermoſt <hi>Indians</hi> were coming down; Major <hi>Schuyler</hi> forthwith ſent the ſame Meſſenger, that brought us the News, to Major <hi>Ingoldsby,</hi> and deſired that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Ammunition ſhould be ſent after us, not knowing what the <hi>Indians</hi> might have occaſion for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 14. About 1 or 2 a Clock in the Morning we decamped, and marched to the ſmall Fort that was made by our 50 Scouts, about ſix a Clock in the Morning, where we had Advice, that the Enemy was not above eight Miles from us; upon which Lieut. <hi>Harme van Slyk</hi> and two <hi>Indians</hi> were ſent to diſcover the Enemy, who brought us word they were marched; two <hi>Indians</hi> came to us with News, that there were 300 of our upper <hi>Indians</hi> within 20 Miles of us, whereupon we ſent two <hi>Indians</hi> back to haſten them up, and to let them know we were there to joyn them. We ſent three <hi>Mohaques</hi> to diſcover the Enemy; about 4 a Clock in the Afternoon we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, and marched to the Place where the Enemy had lain the Night before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 15. In the Morning two of our <hi>Indian</hi> Scouts returned, (the third being run over to the Enemy) who brought us News they had ſeen the Enemy within ten Miles. Our <hi>Indians</hi> came up with us about 12 a Clock, being 290 Men and Boys, ſome Armed, and ſome without Arms, a Conſult being had, we marched about
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52521:6"/>
four a Clock, and encamped all together, having marched about ten Miles that Afternoon. This Night a Conſult was held, and Spyes ſent to diſcover the Enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 16. We marched early in the Morning, and having gone ten Miles, found the place where the Enemy had lain two Nights before; we halted there, an <hi>Oneyde Indian</hi> came from the Enemy, being ſent to our <hi>Indians</hi> to debauch them over to the <hi>French,</hi> which Meſſenger we did not think fit to ſend back, being one of the Priſoners taken at <hi>Tionondoge.</hi> We ſent an Expreſs to Major <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> to acquaint him that the Enemy had built a Fort, and were reſolved to fight us, and ſent for ſupplies of Proviſion, Ammunition, and Men. We marched on toward the Enemy, and met with one of our wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Indians,</hi> who informed, that the Enemy ſtayed for us in a Fort; upon which we marched about two Miles, where a Chriſtian Boy (<hi>Arnant</hi> the Interpreters Son) came to us, who had been three years a Priſoner among the <hi>French,</hi> he gave an Account, that the Enemy were about 6 or 700 Men, and within three Miles; we marched forward to find ſome convenient place to Encamp, and to fortifie our ſelves from the Enemy that Night: We had Scouts out (<hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi>) all Night to watch the Enemies motion, who brought an account in the Morning, that we were within a Mile of their Fort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 17. We decamped, and marched towards the Enemy with Scouts before us, and did not take a direct line, but went round, for fear of an Ambuſcade, and came in ſight of their Fort about eight a Clock in the Morning, where our Scouts came and ſhewed us where the Enemy lay; upon which all the Officers were commanded to take their Poſts, and make ready to engage, being 250 <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and 290 <hi>Indians</hi>; the Enemy ſeeing us, gave three Huzza's, which we anſwer'd with as many, and as loud as they, and made the Woods ring: our <hi>Indians</hi> went to work to fall Trees, and fortifie; but the Enemy ſallyed out immediately; we engaged them, and beat them back into their Fort; our <hi>Indians</hi> fell to work again, and deſired our <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to help, which they did; the Enemy ſallied out with all their Strength a ſecond time, encouraging their Men, crying, <hi>They run, we will cut them all off, and get their Proviſions</hi>; We received
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52521:7"/>
them briskly, and beat them back into their Fort, with the loſs of ſeveral of their Men: Our Men fell to work again about the Fort; the Enemy ſallied out the third time, but were as well repulſed as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and beat into their Fort with conſiderable loſs, our <hi>Indians</hi> bringing ſeveral of their Heads and Scalps into our Fort; after this the Enemy was quiet, and we finiſh'd our Fort: as ſoon as this Skirmiſh was over, we ſent an Expreſs to Major <hi>Ingoldsby,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him what had paſſed, praying him to haſten our Recruits with Proviſion and Ammunition, for that the greateſt part of our Men had not had any Proviſion in two days time; we ſent our Scouts of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> all that Night, to diſcover our Enemies Motion, and lay all Night in our Fort; it was extream bad, cold, ſnowy Weather.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 18. Being cold ſtormy Weather, and Snow, inſomuch that we could ſcarce ſee any Tract; our Scouts came in this Morning, which gave Account that the Enemy were in their Fort, ſome being ſtill popping at our People. About nine a Clock an <hi>Indian</hi> that left the <hi>French</hi> in their Fort, told us, <hi>He thought the Enemy would retreat, that they were packing up their Baggage.</hi> Upon which Major <hi>Schyler</hi> ordered the Captains to draw out their Men to march round the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Fort to ſtop them; but the ſame time had an Account they were fled; he commanded the Officers to purſue them, and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Retreat, till Men and Proviſions came up; but the Men wanting Proviſion, refuſed to march; the Officers, with 60 <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and ſome <hi>Indians,</hi> purſued the Enemy till they had made a ſmall Fortification; but the Officers not having Men to engage them, nor to make a Fort, returned back, leaving two Officers with 40 Men and 100 <hi>Indians</hi> to watch their motion, expecting our Proviſion to come up that Night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 19. About 7 a Clock in the Morning we had an Account that our Proviſions were near at hand, which came up to us about nine or ten a Clock with 80 Men, commanded by Capt. <hi>Simms</hi>; the Proviſions being immediately diſtributed among the Men, thoſe that were firſt ſerved, were commanded away after the Enemy, with five Baskets a Man: About four a Clock, the Van being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52521:7"/>
by Capt. <hi>Peter Matthews</hi> and Capt. <hi>Arent Schuyler,</hi> came up near the Rear of the Enemy, the Scouts telling us the Enemy were within leſs than an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile; we deſired the <hi>Indians</hi> to joyn with us to fall upon their Rear, till the reſt of our Men came up, ſending in the mean time to our People, to march up in all haſte; but the <hi>Indians</hi> halted; and could not be perſwaded to march, the <hi>Mohaques</hi> being moſt unwilling, becauſe the Enemy had dropt ſeveral Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who told them, that if they purſued them, they would kill all their Wives and Children, whom they had Priſoners; after an hours Conſultation of the <hi>Indians,</hi> moſt of our Men came up, we marched with all ſpeed, thinking to overtake the Enemy before they got to the River-ſide; but there being a flake of Ice in one part of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and all open above and below, the Enemy got over before we got up: We encamped by the River-ſide that Night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 20. In the Morning Major <hi>Schuyler</hi> reſolved to march over the River, to purſue the Enemy, ordering the Officers to get the Men ready for that purpoſe; but many of the Men being wearied with fatiegue, their Shoes being quite wore out, and Proviſions ſcarce, were not able to make any further purſuit: But that which did moſt of all diſcourage us, was, that the <hi>Indians</hi> had great averſeneſs to purſue or fall upon the Enemy, becauſe of their Wives and Children; whereupon we marched back.</p>
            <p>In this Engagement we loſt four private Souldiers, and four <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> two Officers, and twelve <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> wounded; and we had an Account by ſome of our <hi>Indian</hi> Priſoners that made their Eſcape, that we killed of the Enemy 33, whereof we found but 27, among which was their Commandant, one Captain, and two other Officers, with two of their commanding <hi>Indians,</hi> and 26 Wounded. We reſcued between forty and fifty Priſoners.</p>
            <p>Since their Retreat we are informed by divers of the Priſoners who come home daily, that all our Men Priſoners except five, have made their eſcape, or are ſet at Liberty, and but few Women and Children left with them, not being able to carry the Priſoners off, by reaſon of their Wounded Men, whereof they carried thirteen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52521:8"/>As we did not hear, ſo we could not expect that your Excellency ſhould in ſo ſhort time (at that Seaſon of the Year) be advanced ſo near us as to <hi>Schenectady,</hi> and that ſo conſiderable Supplies could be ſo ſpeedily got together: And we obſerved it was no ſmall Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to our <hi>Indians</hi> to ſee your Excellency at the head of 300 Men, beſides Volunteers, for our Relief, and theirs; of which we are all ſenſible.</p>

Fletcher,</hi> Governour, who have made their Eſcape from <hi>Canada,</hi> who were Priſoners there, and have been <hi>32</hi> Days by the Way.</head>
            <p>THE ſaid <hi>Cornelius Claeſe van den Bergh</hi> was taken at <hi>Canacta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giere</hi> in <hi>July,</hi> 1691, a little before the Mayor <hi>Peter Schuyler</hi> went to <hi>Canada,</hi> and <hi>Andres Caſpares</hi> who was gone out with ſome of our River <hi>Indians</hi> laſt fall to hunt, and withal, to ſee how the far Nations, called, the <hi>Turchtuicks</hi> lived, was taken laſt <hi>March</hi> by a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Turchtuicks</hi> and <hi>Davaganhaes,</hi> and brought to a Caſtle where the ſaid <hi>Indians</hi> lived, and was there to be burnt and eat by the ſaid <hi>Indians,</hi> from whence he run away that very day he received his cruel Sentence, and was ſixteen days in the Woods, and came to a place where Monſieur <hi>Tontys</hi> People were making a Fort, and the ſaid Monſ. <hi>Tonty,</hi> and Monſ. <hi>La Free</hi> brought him to <hi>Canada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſaid Priſoners ſay, that the <hi>French</hi> informed them, that there were ten Ships come from <hi>France</hi> with Proviſion and Amunition, but no Men, ſcarce ſo many as could ſail their Ships, that they had brought 120000 pound of Flower, and 160000 pound of Pork, alſo ſome great Guns, and two Mortar Pieces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52521:8"/>That there is a Fort built below <hi>Quebeck,</hi> in a narrow Paſſage where Ships muſt paſs; the <hi>French</hi> ſpoke of two Forts, (but an <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> told him only of one Fort,) and twelve Guns in each Fort. They had 1600 Souldiers three year ago, of which a 1000 are killed and taken; this is beſides 200 Inhabitants who are killed.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Cornelius</hi> has lived all this while at the Governour of <hi>Mont Royal</hi>'s Houſe, called, <hi>Monſieur d' Cellier,</hi> and judges there are about 400 Men in <hi>Mont Royal</hi> with Souldiers and all, although the ſaid Monſieur <hi>d' Cellier</hi> often told them, they had 700 Men there.</p>
            <p>There is a Man come over with thoſe Ships to be Monſ. <hi>d' Cellier</hi>'s Cook, who ſays, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had fallen upon the <hi>French</hi> Fleet unawares, and done them ſome damage, and purſued them to <hi>Breſt,</hi> and if they had come but a quarter of an hour ſooner, they had taken <hi>Brest,</hi> and all the Provinces of <hi>Brittanine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> have loſt this Summer 37 <hi>French,</hi> and 70 <hi>Indians</hi> at one time, going up the Falls to <hi>Ottawawa,</hi> and at a ſecond time they loſt 30 <hi>French</hi> the ſame way, and often-times ſmaller Parties killed by our <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Andres Caſparus</hi> ſays further, that when he came to the <hi>French</hi> Houſe, after he had eſcaped from the <hi>Indians,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> tyed him two days, but he being ſo lean and meager, having no Food all that time, but 11 Eggs he found in a Turkies Neſt, and 6 Swan Eggs he found in another place, ſo that the <hi>French</hi> did unty him. About eight days after Monſieur <hi>Tonty</hi> came, (who is in the manner of a Governour among them) and he went down with the ſaid <hi>Tonty</hi> to <hi>Ottawawa,</hi> which was 200 Leagues from that place; the ſaid <hi>Tonty</hi> diſpatched about 25 or 30 great Cannows full of Beaver to <hi>Canada</hi>; and after they had been two days from <hi>Ottawawa,</hi> they met one Monſieur <hi>de Lille,</hi> who had been out a skulking upon the great River, and had taken two Priſoners, who told that 300 of our <hi>Indians</hi> lay at a carrying place on the great River, waiting for the <hi>Ottawawa</hi> Company, and 200 were near <hi>Mont Royal</hi> Iſland, upon the ſame deſign. They ſtopt the ſaid Company till Monſieur <hi>Tonty</hi> ſent for them back, and reſolved to go to <hi>Canada</hi> with 200 Men <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> without Beavers, in which Company the ſaid

            <p>IT is not unknown to ſome of you, that I came laſt <hi>October</hi> into theſe parts upon no other occaſion than to view the Fronteers, and put them into the beſt poſture I could, to ſecure us and you, from the Attempts of the <hi>French,</hi> and their <hi>Indians,</hi> our Enemies and yours. And in order to this, I ſent a ſupply of Ammunition, Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Souldiers, ſufficient to prevent any Inſult from our Enemies, and it had the effect I expected, for they durſt not face the weakeſt of our Garriſons. I came now for your Relief, and have loſt no time; the ſame day that I had an acccount from hence that our Enemies were in this Countrey, I put my ſelf on board a Sloop,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52521:10"/>
and brought with me 150 <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Souldiers, beſides Volunteers, and arrived here before I could be expected; I then immediately march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Schenactady,</hi> from whence I ſent you Supplies of 200 and odd Men, Ammunition, Proviſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with which thoſe that joyned you before, under the Command of Major <hi>Schuyler,</hi> might have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured an entire Victory, and prevented the <hi>French</hi> and their <hi>Indians</hi> from any poſſibility of getting back to their own Houſes; but it has pleaſed God to order it otherwiſe. I had alſo 200 <hi>Chriſtians</hi> more upon their March, who arrived here, and would have been a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Reinforcement to us; but the Action being over, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them back to their former Reſidence, till further Orders. It is obvious to me, and I believe to you all, that this Calamity is fallen on you by your own Faults. I could never ſuppoſe my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the <hi>Mohaques,</hi> would be ſo ſupine and careleſs, as to ſuffer the <hi>French,</hi> and their <hi>Indians,</hi> to enter their Caſtles without the leaſt Reſiſtance. <hi>Theſe Men that have an Enemy near, muſt ſleep with Arms in their Hands, and one Eye open;</hi> that is, they muſt keep Scouts and Spyes, ſo as never to become a Prey to their Enemies, by their own Negligence. I muſt adviſe you, that for the future you keep ſtrict Watch, ſo that I may have timely Notice of the Enemy's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and you will then ſee how eaſily they will be defeated.</p>
            <p>I hope it is now apparent to you, that the great King of <hi>England</hi> is ready to apply his Arms for your defence, when you conſider, that in a very days I am come perſonally to your Aſſiſtance, with near 400 <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Souldiers. I have had the Honour to bear Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand under the great <hi>King of England,</hi> my Maſter, where I have ſeen the <hi>French</hi> fly before his Victorious Arms; and laſt Summer it pleaſed God to add to his Victories, by the Defeat and Deſtruction of their Fleet, in which moſt of their Ships were burnt or ſunk.</p>
            <p>I came now in great haſte, and brought no Preſents with me, but deſign (by the bleſſing of God) to be with you at the beginning of the Summer, to give you ſomething to wipe off your Tears for the Brethren that are lately loſt, to renew the ancient Covenant Chain, and to give you further Aſſurances of the Great King of <hi>England</hi>'s Favour, and of my own Readineſs upon all Occaſions to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52521:10"/>
appear as his Servant, for your Protection againſt our Enemies and yours.</p>
            <p>My preſent Care now is, to provide for the <hi>Mohaques</hi> Nation, about which I have given my Directions to Major <hi>Schuyler,</hi> who will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point them a place for their Reſidence; I have alſo ordered ſome Corn for their preſent Support, which they will receive from him. I muſt add, that it concerns your Honour and Reputation, to make ſome brisk Attempt upon our Enemies, and this with what Secrecy and Expedition you can, that thoſe People may ſee you retain the ancient Courage of your Anceſtors; and I do not queſtion but God will give you Succeſs by a ſevere Revenge on our Enemies and yours.</p>
            <p>I am informed, that your Young Men have killed the Horſes of ſome <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Souldiers, who were upon the ſame Service with you, (it is not Brotherly,) and I deſire, for the future, you will take care to prevent ſuch Outrage, that the ancient Covenant Chain may be preſerved inviolable on your parts, as it will be on the part of my Maſter, the Great King.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I muſt tell you, that <hi>I doubt there is ſome falſe Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers among us, who keeps Intelligence with our Enemies, concealing their Deſigns, and expoſing ours; if you have one Frenchman among you, he will be true to his Countrey, by betraying you.</hi> I have order'd you ſome Bread and Bear, and deſire you will drink the Healths of my Great Maſter and Miſtriſs, the Victorious King, and moſt Illuſtrious Queen, of <hi>Great Britain, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and all Their Majeſties Territories in <hi>America,</hi> and ſo bid you farewell.</p>

            <p>WHen we arrived at <hi>Schenactady,</hi> after our march againſt the Enemy, you were pleaſed to deſire us to come hither, where we heard you, <hi>Great Swift Arrow,</hi> ſpeak, and participated of your Favours; we acknowledge that the Enemy, the <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Canada,</hi> have fallen upon our Brethren, the <hi>Mohaques,</hi> and deſtroyed their three Caſtles, which we can attribute to nothing elſe but their not hearkening to the <hi>Great Swift Arrow</hi>'s good Advice, which was, to keep good Guards and out Scouts.</p>
            <p>We return you, <hi>Brother Great Swift Arrow,</hi> our hearty Thanks for your Care in providing for the <hi>Mohaques,</hi> that they may not ſtarve, nor be in want in this Extremity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother Great Swift Arrow,</hi> You propoſe to us the attacking the Enemy in their Country, to ſhew them that we have not loſt the Courage of our Anceſtors; we return you our hearty Thanks for your good Encouragement, for we are in a manner drunk with the Blood lately ſhed by them. It is not uſual for us, while we are in that Grief and Anxiety, as now we are, to proceed to revenge our ſelves of the Enemy; you have loſt your Blood as well as we, therefore that Blood ought to be revenged unanimouſly by both ſides.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:52521:11"/>
               <hi>Brother Great Swift Arrow,</hi> You recommend us to go and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the Enemy where they are at home in <hi>Canada</hi>; but you are acquainted with us of Old, that it is our Cuſtom, firſt to bewail and condole the Death of them killed by the Enemy, for we are all of one Heart, one Blood, one Soul; nevertheleſs we deſign to go out and to fall upon the <hi>French</hi>; but we muſt firſt ſecure our Caſtles, ſince we know, that the Governour of <hi>Canada</hi> is intended to ſend out a conſiderable Party, but whither we know not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother Great Swift Arrow,</hi> While you preſs us to go and attack the Enemy of <hi>Canada</hi> by Land, we expect (according to the many Promiſes and Engagements made to us) to hear of a conſiderable Force to go with great Guns by Sea, that the Enemy might be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted both ways, and ſo overcome; we preſs this the harder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a great part of our Strength is now broke, and therefore take it not amiſs that we puſh this Point of taking <hi>Canada</hi> by Sea, ſince its impoſſible to be done by Land alone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother Great Swift Arrow,</hi> We return you our hearty Thanks, that you are ſo ready to aſſiſt us upon any Occaſion, and for the good advice to be watchful, and keep out good Scouts and Spies; it is probable, that we would have done a great deal more da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the Enemy, had we been ſo well provided with all ſorts of Ammunition, as the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Canada</hi> are; but ſome of our Men have Guns, and no Powder nor Ball, and ſome but Bows and Arrows, as Major <hi>Schuyler</hi> ſaw, when we came up to him; but the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Canada</hi> ſupplies his <hi>Indians</hi> with all ſorts of Arms and Ammunition, which we found now we engaged them.</p>
            <p>We pray you, <hi>Great Swift Arrow,</hi> to have a careful Eye over us, ſince this Party of the <hi>French</hi> that has deſtroyed the <hi>Mohaques</hi> Caſtles is but part of his Strength, he is working with the <hi>Ottawawa</hi> and <hi>Dowaganhaes Indians,</hi> where he has a great Magazeen, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies them with all ſorts of Ammunition, and we fear that Force will come down upon us ſtill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother Great Swift Arrow,</hi> We return you Thanks for remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring our Dead, and that you will condole their Death, when you
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52521:12"/>
come up in the beginning of Summer, but you can expect no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from us, being in ſo mean a Capacity and Condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother Great Swift Arrow,</hi> You inform us of the great Victory that our Lord of Lord (meaning the great King of <hi>England</hi>) has got upon the <hi>French,</hi> the common Enemy at Sea, which is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and all the Nations are heartily rejoyced at it, and we hope that the great God that has his Seat above the Heavens, will give the ſame ſucceſs to our great Lord of Lords Arms in this part of the World, over his and our Enemies, the <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Canada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We pray that you would be pleaſed to acquaint our great Lord of Lords (who lives over the great Lake) of our mean Condition, and what Poſture we are in, and how eaſy it is to deſtroy <hi>Canada,</hi> if all our great Lord of Lords Subjects in theſe Collonies would unite and joyn together, with ſome Ships that carry great Guns, which our great Lord of Lords can eaſily ſpare us, after this late Victory over the <hi>French</hi> at Sea.</p>
            <p>We deſire that you would be pleas'd to order a Smith to be with us in our Country to repair our Arms, that we may defend us from the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Excellency replyed, That he hoped they were ſufficiently ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of his Readineſs to aſſiſt them, and that the Force the <hi>French</hi> had now ſent, was the moſt they could make; and if they will but keep out Scouts, and advertiſe his Excellency timely of the Enemies coming, his Excellency does not doubt, with the Strength he has in his Province, to deal with the Governour of <hi>Canada,</hi> and all his Power.</p>
            <p>The Governour granted their Requeſt of the Smith to be in their Country to repair their Arms.</p>

            <p>His Excellency replied, that he was much concerned that they ſhould Exerciſe their Arms one againſt another, while there is an Enemy in the Field, and hopes they will for the future endeavour to prevent ſuch Irregularities, That they may be now ſufficiently convinced how ready the Arms of the great King of <hi>England</hi> is to ſuccour them; and that his Excellency, for his own part, will never ſpare to expoſe his Perſon for their Security.
