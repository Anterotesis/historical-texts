            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Again, I have elſewhere ſhewed, that, even from the firſt moment of the conception of an <hi>Embrion,</hi> there is aſſigned <note place="margin">2.</note> to every peculiar member one <hi>Implantate</hi> or <hi>Originary Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> as immediate preſident and Governour thereof, and another <hi>Influent Spirit,</hi> deradiant from the heart, as the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieator</hi> and aſſiſtant of the former; which yet is not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to perfection, nor individually diſpoſed, unleſſe firſt ſubdued to a qualification requiſite by the praeparatory power of the <hi>Implantate.</hi> I have alſo taught, in another place, that every member enjoyes the capacity of <hi>Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> according to the virtue of its peculiar <hi>Ferment</hi> origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally inoculated into its principles; and that, for this reaſon, there can be no expectance of any <hi>tranſmutation,</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:114890:9"/>
conductive to a new <hi>generation,</hi> unleſſe by the mediation of that <hi>Ferment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And from hence, by naturall conſequence, we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that <hi>all vegetation is made by the ſpirits;</hi> and that ſo all debility of digeſtion in the members doth depend upon the diminution of the <hi>ſpirits</hi> and their peculiar <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> according to that in ſacred Writ: <hi>My ſpirit</hi> (the involucrum or conſervatory of the Ferment) <hi>ſhall be attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and</hi> (therefore) <hi>my dayes ſhortned.</hi> So that a member, which in its integrity affords no viſible excrement, muſt produce a large and conſtant ſource of unnatural humor, when once wounded, injured, diminiſhed, or impeded in the vigour of its appropriate Ferment. And, finally, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from hence, that according to the degrees of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury and variety of Cauſes inferring that injury; there muſt be generated a difformity and diſſimilitude of excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments reſpectively. ¶</p>
               <p>Diſeaſes, therefore, have their origine, not from one fountain, particularly from the Head (from whence the <note place="margin">3.</note> Schools wildly imagine all <hi>Catarrhs</hi> to drop down) but from a ſingle <hi>Idiopathy,</hi> or proper indiſpoſition of every part, ſuperinduced upon the <hi>topicall</hi> or domeſtick <hi>Ferments.</hi> Thus, to example, <hi>Wounds,</hi> long after their ſanation, break <note place="margin">4.</note> forth again, and frequently introduce durable <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtems:</hi> and upon change of <hi>Weather,</hi> many years after their perfect conſolidation, fall into a reincrudeſcence, and freſhly renew their torture. Thus <hi>Coughs, Pleuriſies, Spittings of blood,</hi> and <hi>Eriſypelous tumors,</hi> or inflammations, have their ſet viciſſitudes, and, after conſiderable intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, reinvade. For ſome exceſſive montain <hi>Cold,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Damp</hi> ſuddenly ſurpriſing, the nightly <hi>Aer,</hi> mariſh or uliginous <hi>Fog,</hi> or malignant <hi>Fume</hi> belched from the acide bowels of <hi>Mines,</hi> doth frequently, with one aſſault, ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and ruine the <hi>Ferments</hi> of the <hi>brain,</hi> or <hi>Lungs,</hi> that from thenceforward, during the whole after-life, they become the too fertil <hi>magazines</hi> of various <hi>excrements.</hi> After this manner alſo in the eyes, ears, teeth, jaws, &amp;c. Excrements
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114890:10"/>
(not ſuch as the mucous or ſlimy excretions of the brain) are ordinarily occaſioned by the irregularity or diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ferments peculiar to thoſe parts. So <hi>Coughs</hi> and <hi>Aſthmas,</hi> or difficulties of reſpiration firſt begin: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſever by a continued Ferment. Not, in ſooth, by reaſon of <note place="margin">5.</note> a viſcid Phlegme dropping continually from the head; but engendered in the womb of the Lungs, by a violation of their domeſtick Ferment. For the Lungs more eaſily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the invaſion of any forraigne injury, then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the body: in regard, <hi>the Lungs is of all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers the firſt that grows old, decayed, and dies.</hi> As is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt <note place="margin">6.</note> from the Cough generally infeſting old men, and from the rattling in the throats of all dying men, though they periſh by any other diſeaſe, and not by affections of the Lungs. For this is proper to the Lungs, in this reſpect, that they continually ſuck in crude Aer, and being neer to the heart oppreſſed, laviſhly expend their own ſtrength, and by reaſon of that exhauſtion, decay much the ſooner. ¶</p>
               <p>In the firſt place I diſſent from the Schools, becauſe I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well know this kind of vitioſity in nature to belong to <note place="margin">7.</note> the parts <hi>containing,</hi> and not to the humors <hi>contained.</hi> For excrementitious humors of this kind contained, are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain productions, which are begotten by the <hi>Archeus,</hi> or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall preſident of the particular parts, depraved by ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious inquination precedent.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond, I diſſent from them alſo in this point, <note place="margin">8.</note> that I ſtand aſſured, that this evill is <hi>topicall</hi> and <hi>primary,</hi> and not communicated by <hi>Deuteropathy</hi> or <hi>conſent</hi> with the head. For the Coughs of old men, which for the plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity diſcourage all hopes of reſtauration, ariſe from this root; that in the loweſt and ſmalleſt branches of the <hi>Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory Artery,</hi> or pipe of the Lungs, there doth conſtantly reſide ſuch a quantity of excrement, generated in the Lungs, which doth not onely obſtruct the tubes or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duicts: but alſo, by the contagion of its preſence, deprave and diminiſh the <hi>Local Ferment;</hi> whereupon there is hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produced a new ſource or ſupply of excrements, as the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114890:10"/>
plentifull maintainance of Coughs, which in men once entered the calamitous confines of old age, are hardly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by remedies known to vulgar heads: in regard ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies neither <hi>arrive</hi> at the <hi>part affected,</hi> nor, in troth, are they endowed with any <hi>reſtauratory faculty.</hi> Theſe kinds of excrementitious humors, therefore, are no other but <hi>topi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call defects</hi> of the parts miſaffected: and every particular part hath its particular debility, whether innate or acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, from a diminution of its <hi>vegetative Ferment.</hi>

               <p>And thus it is evident, that the various ſtreams of excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">9.</note> flowing from the various parts of the body, are all derived from this one fountain. ¶</p>
               <p>On theſe firm grounds I apprehend, firſt, <hi>That all repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Purgations, in theſe affections, are fruſtraneous and hurtfull:</hi> in reſpect, they levell their power onely againſt the productions, or <hi>Effects,</hi> and not againſt the <hi>Cauſes;</hi> and chiefly becauſe ſuch viſcid excrements, ſeated remotely from the ſtomack, are too ſtubborn and refractory to yield to the laxative operation of <hi>Purgers.</hi> You may pleas to adde, that although <hi>Laxatives</hi> may ſeem to have afforded eaſe and relief, for a day or two after their uſe; inſomuch as the maſſe of crude and inconfected blood in the mezara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick veins being voided by ſtool, there muſt of neceſſity ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the more ſparing diſpenſation of blood through the body, and penury of nouriſhment in the Lungs, and by conſequence a leſſe quantity of excrement be rejected: yet do they, by ſubſtracting from the neceſſary aliment of the whole, and by leaving behind them an evill tincture in the inſtruments of common digeſtion, every day more and more infringe the univerſall oeconomy of the body, and impugne the conſerving vigour of nature.</p>
               <p>This when Phyſicians darkly, as through a veile, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <note place="margin">10</note> and remain ignorant, that they have afforded no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to their Patients, by the exhauſtion of the laudable ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the body, and the diminution of naturall vigour; they at length remit them to the ſober rules of <hi>Diet,</hi> and <hi>kitchen phyſick,</hi> as the onely hopefull means of their reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114890:11"/>
and ſo leave them, by the painfull uſe of <hi>Fontanels,</hi> and reiterated moderate <hi>Purges,</hi> to run out their remaining ſands, <hi>medicaly</hi> (i. e.) <hi>miſerably.</hi> By which Conceſſion, firſt, they inſinuate that wholeſome and moderate diet is to be preferred to moſt of thoſe unfaithfull medicaments of the ſhops: and upon the teſtimony of their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy experience, conclude, that the Patient ought to abſtain from them, as hurtfull, and at beſt but rarely to be uſed. Our wiſh is, that now, after ſo many deſtructive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtions of ſick mens ſtrength, they would ſit down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and in the future no more attempt, by the ſame fruitleſſe means, to dreigne the hopes, bodies, veins, ſtrength, and purſes of the ſick. At leſt, I wiſh, that they would be mindfull of their own Axiome, wherein they unanimouſly conſent, <hi>That the chiefeſt indication of the cure, is to be deſumed from the benefit or harme which things already uſed have introduced.</hi> Which rule, although it be worthy the bluſhes of learned men, and onely fit for the conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">11.</note> of Empyricks: yet, it may be wiſhed, that, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction thereof, they would be reclaimed from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of their former errors, and no longer in Coughs and Conſumptions return to thoſe inefficacious remedies, which they have obſerved, never to have been beneficiall to any.

of their <hi>primary Cauſes.</hi> And they had farther diſcovered, that a medical Courſe of Diet, is but a wild, languid, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid and indeed deſperate kind of remedy; and <hi>Kitchen A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſmes</hi> too contemptible a <hi>militia</hi> to encounter ſo formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable an Adverſary, already entered upon the borders of life, and ready to diſſolve the <hi>diſcordant Harmony</hi> of the whole Compoſition, by the generall diffuſion of its tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. No wonder therefore, if the Common people, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the vanity of ſuch Cures, have taken occaſion to create this proverbe, <hi>The beſt phyſick, is to take no phyſick.</hi> ¶</p>
               <p>More then once have I lamented, out of a deep Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeration <note place="margin">12.</note> of the hard Condition of man, while I read over whole Centuries of the Councels of Phyſicians, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Commentaries on the 9. <hi>Rhaſ. ad Almanſorem,</hi> where they run over all diſeaſes of the body, from the Crowne of the head to the ſole of the foot; that digging into the Center of each diſeaſe (as they believe and glory) and there exploring the Grandfather, or procatarctick Cauſe thereof, they ever and anon lay the blame on ſome one <hi>ſingular diſtemper,</hi> either naturall or acquired: but yet with ſuch a reſerve of uncertainty, that they dare not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely determine, whether they ought to account that <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper</hi> for the <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> or onely for the <hi>Antecedent Cauſe</hi> of the diſeaſe, about which they Conſult. But to prevent miſtake, and to be ſure of the right, generally in all infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities they accuſe both <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>cold.</hi> For example, in moſt, they cry out upon a <hi>Frigidity</hi> of the <hi>ſtomack,</hi> either ſolitary, or combined with an exceſſive <hi>Heat</hi> of the <hi>Liver;</hi> whence they foretell <hi>Catarrhs</hi> to be engendered, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies of thoſe parts, upon which ſuch rheumes ſhall be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned downe: and this hint they purſue unto the explora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the nature not onely of very many <hi>Internall,</hi> but alſo of moſt <hi>Externall</hi> and Cutany defects. And with ſuch <hi>Theorical</hi> and <hi>Practical</hi> decretals do the ſchools ſeaſon the brains of their Diſciples. For thus are infirmities of the eyes, ears jawes, tongue, teeth, cheſt, arms, loyns, and thighs, charged upon the account of Catarrhs. Thus
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114890:12"/>
have Coughs, Conſumtions, difficulties of reſpiration, Pleuriſies, Inflammations of the Lungs, Apoplexies, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, ſuddain Deaths, Impoſtumes, Spittings of blood, found their pedigrees deduced from Diſtillations. Thus finally, is the ſtomack infeſted with Vomiting, Nauſeou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, dejection of Appetite, and debility of Concoction: as alſo the Liver and Spleen become miſaffected. For crude and indigeſtible Phlegme being dropped downe from the retort of the Head, Obſtructions, Hardneſſes, Dropſies, Apoſtems, Schirrous tumors, Fevers, torments of the bowels, &amp;c. are liſted under the conduct of Catarrhs.</p>

               <p>And this fabulous ſcene of Defluxions, which indeed is very well worth our ſerious tears, do the Schools ſo poliſh and trim up, and deliver from hand to hand down to poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; that it now dares plead preſcription, and uſurpe the ſacred dignity of truth: yea common Idiots, by their own infirmities made <hi>paſſive Phyſicians,</hi> tire my ears with a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lecture of their Catarrhs.

hardly part with that odour, wherewith they were firſt ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned: it is my cuſtome, even among perſons of honour, to affect ſilence, not to preach upon the diſeaſe, or its Cauſes, ſeveral kinds, and remedies; but quietly concealing my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of the eaſie theory of the Schools, and diſſembling an ignorance of all, go away as conſenting to whatever hath been ſaid. Yet, in ſome places, I adventure to leave a hint, that I am otherwiſe inſtructed, that Fools are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellated to a capacity of medicinal Principles, nor my ſelfe to be their Paedagog. At beſt, I cannot but admire, that no man hath hitherto, after ſo long a revolution of time, ever diſcovered, and made animadverſions on the palpable and ſuperlative ignorance of Phyſicians: but that the grey-haired dreams of the Grecians have drawne the whole Chriſtian World after them, into a ſervitude. <note n="*" place="margin">

3. The ſuperiour way from the ſtomack, is the <hi>Gullet,</hi> or <hi>oeſophagus,</hi> being a membrane round long and hollow, as a Pipe or Cane, extended from the ſtomack even up unto the jawes, and in ſubſtance the ſame with the interior Coate of the ſtomack.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Gullet, by the privilege of its native conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is ever actually <hi>moyſt,</hi> and conſtantly (except at times of ſwallowing) actually <hi>ſhut</hi> (otherwiſe, diſtorted in avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> it would laterally fall together, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then a bladder that wants ſome gueſt to fill its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity:) and the ſides thereof mutually meet and touch each the other, by the compulſion of that neceſſity of Nature, which forbids a <hi>

But that it is not open, is evident from this, that otherwiſe, at the ſwallowing downe of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morſell of our Diet the Aer, which would be beneath the morſell, and oppoſe the deſcent thereof, were the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell proportionate in gravity to the <hi>renitency</hi> of the <hi>Aer,</hi> muſt be rammed downe into the cavity of the ſtomack; and ſo there muſt follow for every morſell ſwallowed a <hi>Belch,</hi> or rediſcharge of that aer, by the ſuperior outlet of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack. Finally, ſince the membrane of this Gullet is always moyſt, the ſides thereof would of neceſſity fall together, if not diſtended by ſome force: which is never obſerved in the diſſections of <hi>dead,</hi> nor could be of any uſe in <hi>living bodies.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="7">7. The <hi>Gullet</hi> neither ſucks in, nor containes any Aer: for by reaſon of its proper motion, naturall to it as a moyſt membrane, and want of any body to diſtend it from within, it falls together on all ſides.</p>

               <p n="9">9. The lower end of the Gullet is contracted by an aliene power, and is therefore never opened but by the violence of ſome aliment or other tenent, either entering into, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed from the ſtomack: Or upon the knocking of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> it may be unlocked by a <hi>ſtrange key,</hi> i. e. not by its own motion, ſince the <hi>humidity</hi> of its ſides naturally diſpoſeth them to <hi>Concidence,</hi> or falling together.</p>

               <p n="12">12. That ſince two bodies cannot ſo far rebell againſt the conſerving <hi>Laws of Nature,</hi> as mutually to penetrate each the others dimenſions, in one and the ſame place; and ſince the paſſage from the jawes up into the brain is exceeding narrow, oppleted (for there is no <hi>vacuity</hi> in thoſe organs) barrocadoed above and ſo impervious (for our very breath, though violently compreſſed by ſtopping of the mouth and noſtrils, cannot force open a way into the caſtle of the brain:) therefore cannot a vapour, ariſing from the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, approach the <hi>baſis</hi> of the brain.

In the Aer there perpetually ſaile up and down whole Clouds of duſt atomized; and therefore, by a continuall neceſſity, together with our breath we ſuck in whole ſwarms of theſe duſty atomes: and by conſequence, the whole cavity of the Cheſt would in a very ſhort time be filled with dirt, if nature had not provided us of lungs, in whoſe narrow Meanders, and almoſt impervious poroſities, theſe Atomes of Duſt might be ſtopt and hindered from fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advance. And in this relation, the Lungs have no other way of diſcharging their excrements, but by <hi>Exſcreation;</hi> that the duſt drawn in together with the Aer, might be pumpt out of the Pipes of the Lungs, at the ſame inſtant the ordinary excrements of the cheſt are avoyded. A <hi>uſe,</hi> indeed, which hath hitherto layne obſcure and neglected by the Schools; who have unanimouſly denied the Lungs to be pervious. The haire, indeed, wherewith the noſtrils are fringed, like a net, catcheth all the ſmall fibres or threds of Atomes flying in the aer, and hinders their further ingreſſe: and the numerous folds, and annulary Cartilages of the Aſpera Arteria, are like ſo many labyrinths to arreſt and fix the finer duſt, that it ſinke not to the bottome of the Lungs. In order to our proofe, That <hi>the Lungs are immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> we have a very ſufficient argument from the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned uſe of them: and not onely that, but further alſo, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that the ſubſtance of the Lungs is uncapable of <hi>Expanſion</hi> and <hi>Conſtriction.</hi> And therefore the Lungs of <hi>Birds</hi> (ſerving to the ſame common uſe of reſpiration, as well in them, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> us) in regard they are, by many viſible fibres, cloſely annexed and chained to the ribs, cannot by ſucceſſive or reciprocall <hi>Dilatation</hi> and <hi>Conſtriction,</hi> make up the compariſon of a pair of bellows.

Now the three <hi>Veſſels</hi> are <hi>Canals</hi> or Conduits, equally divaricated and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed through their whole ſubſtance; and the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are ever repleted with blood, and therefore abſolutely impoſſible it is ſor them to receive in any of the Aer drawn in by inſpiration: but the third is ever open, filled with Aer, and ſo incapable of any new inſpired aer, untill the aer drawn in at the laſt dilatation of the Cheſt, be firſt diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down into the capacity of the Cheſt; for which reaſon, undoubtedly the aſpera arteria, as alſo the Membrane en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhrowding the Lungs, are full of ſmall <hi>perforations.</hi> For this third Canale, conſiſting alſo of Cartilagineous or griſtly rings, made contiguous each to other, by the intervention of a horny membrane, is ever diſtended and open; no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then the main trunk of the Windpipe. The fourth part of the Lungs, is their parenchymatick Fleſh, altogether as incapable to admit the advenient Aer. To conclude, the fifth part is a membrane, ſerving as a Coat to inveſt the whole ſtructure. This ſumm'd up and conſidered, the reſult muſt be; <hi>that no part of the Lungs bath any room to entertaine any of the ſmalleſt parcell of the Aer brought in by inſpiration: and that no part of them can, without violence and the dilacera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſubſtance, endure the reciprocall motion of Dilatation and Conſtriction.</hi> A miracle it is to me, I profeſſe, that the Schools, notwithſtanding the uncontroulable evidence of this verity, can yet ſnort in their inveterate Lethargy: that though they ſtand convinced, and allow of all our allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as true beyond all Scepticity; yet doe they not, even to this very day, ceaſe to preach up their abſurd opinion, that the Lungs are continually, by a reciprocation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary motions, like thoſe of a paire of bellows, diſtended and recompreſſed. Again, the third of theſe veſſels, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Tubes (though we ſhould grant it not to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> continually repleted with aer, but an abſolute vacuity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed by any aer at all) in reſpiration (when yet it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains

For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> a cloſe, when any man hath received a wound with a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or poyniard, through the intercoſtal muſcles; tis diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable with half an eye, whether or no the ſtab hath pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated into the cavity of the Cheſt: for if yea, then is the aer, upon conſtriction of the Cheſt, exploded by the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the wound in ſo ſtrong a ſtream, that it will blow out the flame of a candle at conſiderable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; which could not ſtand with poſſibility, if the aer attracted by inſpiration did not paſſe through the Lungs into the cavity of the Cheſt. And the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this is, that the <hi>Lungs have no motion at all.</hi> A principal Argument, for the illuſtration of this <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox,</hi> is, that in the breaſt is ſeated a double <hi>membrane,</hi> perpendicularly interſecting the cavity thereof, from the neck down to the midrife, and therefore called the <hi>Mediaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> or partition wall, provided by nature to guard the heart from the injuries of aer. This <hi>Mediaſtinum</hi> divides the cavity of the Cheſt into a right and left. Now mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> it is, upon the conviction of the former experiment, that the aer ſuckt in by inſpiration, is drawne directly downe into the cavity of the Cheſt; as alſo that the <hi>Lungs</hi> are, for the ſame reaſon, devoyd of all motion. A ſecond <hi>Argument,</hi> no leſſe obvious or ſatisfactory, may be collected from the <hi>purulent expectorations in Pleuriſies.</hi> For in theſe diſeaſes are ever rejected by cough ſuch excrements, as were firſt generated of blood extravenated and putrified, in the parts adjacent to the ribs, and membrane enſhrowding the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114890:30"/>
hollow of the Cheſt: and therefore it is of neceſſity, that the coat of the Lungs muſt be full of conſiderable <hi>poroſities,</hi> or <hi>perforations,</hi> which ſuffice to the eaſie tranſmiſſion of blood and thick purulent matter. All theſe things the Schools ſee, know, confeſſe, and write of: and yet are ſo effronted by cuſtome, that they adventure to deny, that the aerattra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by inſpiration, is carried through the Lungs down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hollow of the Cheſt; but affirme that the ſubſtance of the Lungs is perpetually agitated, twixt expanſion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, like a pair of bellows. They concede, indeed, that the Lungs have many pores or ſmall perforations, through which the extravenated blood and apoſtemated matter in Pleuriſies are imbibed and ſpungd up: but will by no means grant, that the more ſubtile and penetrative Aer can be tranſmitted through thoſe pores into the cavity of the Cheſt. Nor is there, why we ſhould wonder at this obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate infatuation; ſince they ſpeculate onely <hi>dead</hi> bodies, in which the pores of the membrane inveſting the Lungs are cloſed up by the condenſing hand of death: and the ſame conſtantly happens in the <hi>optick Nerves,</hi> the <hi>ſpinal marrow, interſtice</hi> or midle partition of the <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>orifices</hi> of the <hi>meſaraick veins</hi> looking into the guts. The Lungs of any beaſt float upon the water, while they are boyling whole, but minced into ſmall gobbets, they preſently ſink to the bottom: the reaſon belongs to the impletion of the Aſpera arteria with aer. And if boyling water (pardon us the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency) cannot find acceſſe into the ſubſtance of the Lungs, while they are decocted; which way (we beſeech you) can the groſſer matter of a frigid Catarrh hope to force an entrance into it, at pleaſure? The ſame is alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable by an <hi>experiment,</hi> as eaſily made as mentioned. Let any man, by a ſtrong <hi>efflation,</hi> breath out all the aer in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> his cheſt, as much as poſſibly he can; then with a ribon meaſure the <hi>circumference</hi> of his body, neer the point of the <hi>ſwordlike Cartilage,</hi> above the pit of the ſtomack: and again, by as ſtrong <hi>inflation,</hi> fill his breaſt with aer, and meaſure it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the ſecond time, and he ſhall find, by comparing the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114890:30"/>
meaſures, that more aer is attracted into the cheſt by inſpiration, then can be conteined in the dimenſions of the Lungs. And much more, when he ſhall allow for that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of aer which tending directly downwards, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the <hi>midrife</hi> upon the <hi>ſtomack.</hi> Try the ſame expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, another way; draw in ſo much breath, as you can; then blow it immediately forth into a bladder, and you ſhall finde, as before, that the <hi>quantity of aer</hi> inſpired doth by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny degrees exceed the <hi>magnitude</hi> of the <hi>Lungs.</hi> But in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> mean time, be pleaſed to remember, that all the ſmaller tubes of the rough Arterie, as well as the upermoſt large canale, remain conſtantly wide open, as being diſtended by their Annulary Catilages, and muſt therefore be repleted with Aer, ſince <hi>nature and an abſolute vacuity are incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> No doubt, but the belly and breaſt owe their <hi>intume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence</hi> to the inſpiration of aer; if therefore the Lungs were capable of diſtenſion (which yet ſeems to us impoſſible) yet could they not be diſtended to a capacity ſufficient to admit the tenth part of that aer, which the <hi>Thorax</hi> upon inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth ordinarily receive; allowing for that aer, which doth depreſſe the <hi>midrife</hi> downwards, and remain in the ever diſtended pipes of the rough <hi>Arterie,</hi> in avoydance of <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity.</hi> By inference therefore, the motion of the Thorax doth argue the motion of the Lungs unneceſſary. Should <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> we grant, that the Lungs could fill the whole cavity of the cheſt (which the moſt impudent ignorance dares not aſſert) then would it ſound concordant to reaſon, that the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ribs ſhould dilate the Lungs: but ſince the <hi>aer,</hi> by the laws of its conſtitution, is ſubject to <hi>Dilatation</hi> and <hi>Compreſſion</hi> (as common Philoſophy phraſeth it) therefore could not the elevation of the ribs draw in a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of aer. Yea, ſince that attraction cannot but be violent (as being a <hi>ſhift</hi> Nature is put upon, for the prevention of a <hi>vacuum)</hi> i. e. è diametro adverſe to naturall and vital mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it follows, that the <hi>motion of the ribs is not ordeined nor conductive to the dilatation of the Lungs.</hi> And ſince the Lungs have, neither in themſelves, nor by inſuſion from any other
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114890:31"/>
part, any principle or <hi>Cauſalitie of peculiar Motion;</hi> other then that dependent on the motion of the ribs (according to the Schools:) it reſults a ſerene and irrefutable truth, that they have no motion at all; but from the firſt to the laſt moment of Animation, continue quiet, without <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation</hi> of <hi>Figure,</hi> or <hi>enlargement</hi> and <hi>contraction</hi> of <hi>Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi> What clearer manifeſt of folly and invincible do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> can there be, then to confeſſe, that all the twigs, or ſmaller Canals of the rough Arterie are conſtantly wide open, as being neceſſarily diſtended by the contexture of the ringlike Cartilages: and yet at the ſame time confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to maintain, that all the ſame Canals, upon the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and exploſion of aer, in the reciprocal motions of Reſpiration, are dilated and compreſſed? Beſides all this, the Schools, in their lectures, deliver it for eſtabliſht <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> beyond diſpute, that the <hi>Diaphragme</hi> or midrife doth, as <hi>prime</hi> and <hi>ſole Efficient,</hi> ſuffice to the ordinary uſe of <hi>Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> and yet anon they fall foul on their own maximes, and ſubſtitute the <hi>intercoſtal muſcles,</hi> as <hi>Coadjutors,</hi> or Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries, to the performance of that office. Again, there frequently ariſe out of the ſtomack ſuch <hi>belchings,</hi> as carry along with them the lively expreſſions of <hi>odours</hi> formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Lungs by inſpiration: therefore are the <hi>Lungs and midrife perſpirable,</hi> that is drild full of ſmall poro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. In earneſt, tis worthy our moſt paſſionate tears, that the Schools have, for ſo many ages together, unhapily miſpent their ſweat and oyle, in fripperies, childiſh page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antry, and compoſing Romances more wild then thoſe of the Talmud or Arioſto. I ſhall urge another eaſie and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar experiment; if, in a prone decumbency, that is lying with your face to the earth, you place one hand on your belly, and the other on your ribs, and at the ſame time draw your breath at a moderate rate, you ſhall then plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the <hi>muſcles of the Abdomen are the onely operators in the buſineſſe of reſpiration:</hi> that the belly being lifted up, the midrife is drawn downward; and conſequently that the cavity of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> is by ſo much enlarged, by how
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114890:31"/>
much the plane or <hi>diameter</hi> of the midrife (in itſelf lax and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> undiſtended) is leſſe then its <hi>ſemicircle,</hi> when it is drawne downward, and ſo much the larger, by how much the more lax the plane of the midrife is. Nay whats more, if you bind in your ribs with a ſtreight girdle, and then fetch your breath very gently, you ſhall ſenſibly perceive the belly to be reciprocally elevated and depreſſed, the ribs all the while remaining quiet, without any viſible motion at all; and by conſequence, that the Lungs in this caſe, ſhould we grant them to move at other times (which truth forbids) can remain quiet a whole day together, if the conſtriction laſt ſo long. But in <hi>ſighing, oſcitation, ſternutation,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe</hi>

For the ribs are <hi>ſemicircles</hi> propendent downward, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched into a lateral convexity; to each of which is annexed one of the <hi>intercoſtal muſcles,</hi> which bend them upward, and by a kind of familar violence diminiſh their convexity in the dilatation of the Cheſt.

Which inſtance puts it amongſt truths moſt manifeſt, that the aer attracted by inſpiration is carried through the Lungs into the cavity of the cheſt. The ſame have I obſerved alſo in a very <hi>Noble Lady,</hi> who got this misfortune in her tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile; that whenever ſhe held her breath, ſhe had one ſide of her throat blowne up, like a bladder diſtended with aer, to ſuch a monſtrous greatneſſe, that no care or art could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="T"/> conceal it from the ſtanders by.

Since all <hi>voluntary Motion</hi> is performed by a <hi>Muſcle,</hi> as the part ſolely and principally adapted by <hi>Nature</hi> to that action, by a <hi>retraction</hi> of the <hi>taile</hi> toward the <hi>head</hi> thereof; therefore, if their opinion ſtand allied to verity, muſt the <hi>midrife</hi> be a <hi>prime, heteroclite,</hi> and moſt <hi>principal Muſcle,</hi> and the <hi>head</hi> thereof ſeated in its <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> 2. If the midrife be an organ primarily executive of motion; then, though the Muſcles both of the Abdomen and ribs ceaſe from all Contraction and relaxation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, would the midrife maintain the ſucceſſive motions of reſpiration, by its own <hi>ſingle power:</hi> Which experiment poſitively denies. 3. Yea the muſcles of the Abdomen, which are ordinary muſcles, would have no motion proper to themſelves, but be moved, at ſecond hand, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious motion of the midrife. 4. Vain and uſeleſſe would
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114890:33"/>
the contrivement of nature be, and her architecture imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in ſuperfluity, in making the abdominal muſcles; and the belly might have as conveniently been cloathed with the ſingle coat of the Carnous Membrane, as with the bombaſt and duplications of ſo many muſcles. 5. Since every organ of Voluntary motion doth execute its function by <hi>Traction,</hi> or drawing the part, into which its <hi>tendon</hi> is inſerted, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards itſelf; the breaſt, according to this error of the Schools, would be drawne very much inward by the <hi>Traction</hi> of the midrife, and the <hi>waſt</hi> convelled into the dwindling figure of an Houreglaſſe. <note n="*" place="margin">Clepſydra <hi>in archetypo: quaeeſt organum quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam artificiale, quo ex aqua, de vitro in vitrum deorſum, per ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile foramen, gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulatim deſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lante, horas metiri ſolebant antiqui.

If therefore <hi>Suffumigations</hi> and <hi>aromatick exhalations,</hi> ſuch as promiſe a gratefull ſuccour to the Lungs in their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, be injurious and burdenſome; what will not groſſer and <hi>ſlimy Lambatives</hi> do, though we grant them to arrive at the lower veſſels of the lungs, with all their vertue and efficacy about them? No man, that ever ſaw but one diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, will deny, that when ever any thing is ſwallowed down into the ſtomack, at the ſame inſtant the <hi>Larynx</hi> is ſhut cloſe by the <hi>Epiglottis,</hi> or trap doore, that carries the figure of an <hi>Ivy-leafe;</hi> ſo that not the ſmalleſt atome can ſlip into the Lungs.

               <p n="55">55. And here we are falne upon the detection of another collateral Error of the Schools; in particular, their unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed Aſſertion, that <hi>Lambatives ſwallowed down gently and by degrees, the head being at the ſame time reflected into a poſition looking above the horizon, deſcend into the Lungs; but not thoſe, that are ſwallowed down greedily, and at once.</hi> If ſo, I demand,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:114890:37"/>
whether the dog under the diſſecting knife, did <hi>lick</hi> and <hi>by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> ſwallow downe the coloured liquor; or <hi>chop</hi> it down <hi>at once?</hi> To what purpoſe did the Anatomiſts poure it into his throat to be drank at one ſwallow or gulp, if they knew before hand, that it could not fall into the Lungs, unleſſe lickt down gently? But letting this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> ſtand, that the Lungs abſolutely abhor the admiſſion of all external things, meer Aer and ſuch as is not incorporated to Fumes and Exhalations onely excepted: and then it will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow, that whether any thing be lickt down gently, or drank down ravenouſly at once; yet ſtill the <hi>Preſident</hi> of the <hi>Epiglottis,</hi> or <hi>janitor</hi> of the Lungs attends the execution of his function, and obſerves the <hi>Clauſure</hi> of the <hi>Larynx;</hi> ſince thereupon depends no leſſe then the hazard of life. This, I conceive, may make it indubious to the moſt preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, that <hi>Lambatives and ſyrups,</hi> though they may, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing an <hi>unctuous ſurface</hi> upon the parts, make them more <hi>ſmooth,</hi> ſlippery, and ſo more fit for the rejection of viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid excrements flowing from the palate and other parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent; yet are they of no ſmall <hi>detriment</hi> to the <hi>ſtomack,</hi> nor can, in the leſt degree, or largeſt latitude of intention, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford eaſe or benefit in affections of the <hi>Lungs.</hi> But the Schools reply, that the ſalivous rheume or defluxion, doth <hi>inſenſibly,</hi> and by its own <hi>ſpontaneous laps,</hi> or natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, diſtill into the <hi>Larynx;</hi> and that, in this relation, <hi>Lambatives</hi> muſt be beneficial and ſanative.</p>

happens, that they muſt turn themſelves on one ſide, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake and ſit up, <hi>nature</hi> being affrighted by the terror of the <hi>danger</hi> imminent: and if any of the ſpitle fall accidentally and unawares into the Larynx; thenceforward, untill all be again exploded, they cough unceſſantly.

Which wanteth not a multitude of abſurdities. In like manner, ſhould the Catarrh be rained down betwixt the <hi>two membranes;</hi> each of thoſe ſlender in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtments, provided by nature to envellop the ſpinal marrow, would be <hi>double:</hi> which Anatomical inſpection could never yet juſtifie. And ſhould we allow it ſo to be, it would not onely impede the <hi>motion</hi> of the <hi>Muſcles;</hi> but alſo excite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme <hi>torture,</hi> and <hi>convulſive retractions</hi> of the Nerves. So there lieth an <hi>Error</hi> in the <hi>Theſis;</hi> ſince the <hi>Nerve,</hi> indeed, is the <hi>organ delative of the mandates of the Will,</hi> (i. e.) the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory inſtrument by which the Will tranſmits her ſpiritual Mercuries on an errand to the muſcles: but not <hi>Executive of Voluntary motion,</hi> (i. e.) not the immediate executioner of the commands given out. More plainly thus; the Will is <hi>Queen Regent;</hi> the <hi>Animal ſpirits,</hi> the <hi>Nuncij,</hi> or Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors; the <hi>Nerve,</hi> the inſtrument of their <hi>tranſvection</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from the brain, or white-hall of the ſoul, to the member to be imployed; and the <hi>muſcle,</hi> the <hi>executioner</hi> of her deſignes. That a Nerve is not the executioner of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary motion, may be clearly argued from hence; that very few nerves, in <hi>thickneſſe</hi> exceeed a thread of double twiſted ſilk. Now a Nerve, being inſerted into the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part of its peculiar muſcle, cannot probably convey the rheume down to the midle of the muſcle, without inferring
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114890:39"/>
a <hi>Palſie</hi> of that part, from its own <hi>obſtruction,</hi> or a <hi>convulſion</hi> from the <hi>aerimony</hi> and virulency of the <hi>Defluxion.</hi> Again, if they ſhall affirme, that the Catarrh doth trickle down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Dura mater</hi> and the <hi>Skull;</hi> I may appeal for deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to <hi>Anatomy,</hi> which autoptically demonſtrateth, that the <hi>perforations</hi> of the ſpondils of the ſpine, through which the nerves are threaded in their elongations from their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, the ſpinal marrow, are ſo exactly fitted to their mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, that not a hair can be thruſt between, without a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Compreſſion of the nerve; ſo that, by conſequence, there can be no void ſpace left for the intruſion of a Catarrh into the muſcles, from the ſpinal marrow. We add, that though our Adverſaries could find out a <hi>place;</hi> wherein this fictitious rheume may be <hi>congregated;</hi> or <hi>paſſage</hi> for its <hi>deflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion</hi> upon the ſpinal marrow, and <hi>diffuſion</hi> thence through the <hi>perforatiens</hi> of the ſpondils into the muſcles: yet, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, it would amuſe their ſophiſtry, to give a plauſible reaſon of the <hi>ſucceeding progreſſe</hi> thereof, and fully to make out, how a humor, once delapſed upon a nerve running out betwixt two ſpondils, can remigrate, or return back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to invade other nerves ſucceſſively one after the other. What, doth the wanton rheume grow weary of one nerve, and to ſatisfie its deſire of change, at pleaſure remove to another? Tis a <hi>Quaere</hi> not unworthy a ſubſtantial determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, how a deluge of ſalt rheume can ſtream along a tender and extremly ſenſible nerve, without cauſing a <hi>ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> or <hi>dull inſenſibility,</hi> in that member into which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted? Can it inſinuate into the tendinous <hi>head,</hi> and thence creep along into the <hi>taile</hi> of a <hi>muſcle?</hi> Can it retreat thence again, to aſſault other muſcles ſucceſſively, as the ſituation of the ſecond is more <hi>prone</hi> or <hi>declive</hi> then of the former, and that then the third, &amp;c? or, if there may be a new ſupply of the defluxion, conſtantly ſucceeding, imagined to flow from parts above, to freſh ones below; how comes it to paſſe, that the ſuperior parts, firſt invaded, obtain an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity from the miſchiefe? For ſince the rivulet of rheume doth ſpring from one <hi>fountain,</hi> the <hi>brain;</hi> and run in one

continued <hi>Chanel,</hi> the <hi>ſpinal marrow:</hi> why ſhould it not rather follow the <hi>old</hi> tract, then wander into a <hi>new,</hi> and undergo the difficulties of forcing, and as it were mining out a freſh current? Why doth it, as if carried on by an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous unconſtancy, deſert its antiently accuſtomed bed; and affect the embraces of a <hi>freſh,</hi> nay frequently a <hi>feeble</hi> part? Why doth it forſake its frequented quarters, and range in queſt of ſtrang and never yet frequented lodgings? Hath it ſuch an Appetite or malitious propenſity inherent, that goads it on to variety of objects, whereon to ſate its hoſtility? For concluſion; that this Error can expect no ſanctuary, in the poſſibility of the rheums defluxions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>skull</hi> and the <hi>skin,</hi> and through the firme ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>Muſcles,</hi> each being inveſted with a tunicle ſufficiently compact and thick: may be amply collected from our precedent diſquiſitions. ¶</p>

By this time, we believe, it is plain and unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that no ſalt, acid, ſharp, phlegmatick, or Cholerick humor can diſtil from the brain; but that, whenever the <hi>Influent</hi> ſpirit, polluted with ſome alien and putrefactive <hi>impreſſion,</hi> doth arrive at any part of the body; then doth nature, without delay, ſend thither the <hi>Latex,</hi> or ſourſe of ſerous humidity, to <hi>expung</hi> this impreſſion, or at leaſt rinſe away the <hi>Excrements,</hi> there growing from the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>digeſtive Faculty.</hi> For the <hi>Spirit,</hi> once vitiated by any forreigne <hi>Contagion,</hi> wildly rangeth at pleaſure through the <hi>nerves, arteries,</hi> yea and the very <hi>habit</hi> of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; whereupon, the ſick ſeeming to feel as it were the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion, or trickling down of a cold rheume, the <hi>brain</hi> is immediately accuſed as treacherous, and the grand author of this ryot and irregularity in nature.
