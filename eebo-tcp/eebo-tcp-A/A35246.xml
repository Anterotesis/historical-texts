            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>To make up the full measure of Bawdry, and to justifie the Nullity; a search must be made into the Lady, to find whether there had been a Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, and a Jury of grave Matrons were found fit for that purpose; who, with their Spectacles ground to lessen, not to make the <hi>Letter</hi> larger, after their Inspection into the Premises, gave Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, she was <hi>Intacta Virgo,</hi> which was thought very strange, for the World took notice, that her way was very common, before ever <hi>Somerset</hi> trod in it; besides they two having lived so long in Adultery together. The Plot was contrived thus, The Lady of <hi>Essex,</hi> pretending Modesty, makes humble Suit to the Bawdy Bishops (who were all concerned in this Stratagem) that she might come Vailed into the Court, which they all readily granted: One Mrs. <hi>Turner</hi> was dressed in the Countesses Cloaths; and at that time too young to be other than <hi>Virgo Intacta.</hi>

            <p>Secretary <hi>Wynwood</hi> having been affronted, and much abused by <hi>Somerset,</hi> in his Secretaryship, does now carry himself in a kind of braving way against him, being struck in with the Faction of <hi>Viller</hi>'s who was now the risi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now are in Hold, the Earl, his Countess, Sir <hi>Thomas Monson,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Turner, Weston,</hi> and <hi>Franklin,</hi> with some others of less Note; the three last Named were immediately Arraigned, Tryed, and Executed.</p>
            <p>The next that came on the Stage was the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess, and Sir <hi>T.

            <p>The People of <hi>England</hi> having in Memory the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Cruelty of 88. and hating the Popish Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, generally hated this Match, and loathed the thoughts of having the <hi>Romish</hi> Priests to walk about the Streets in their Habits, and would have bought it off at the dearest Rate; and, what they durst, oppos'd it by Speeches, Counsels, Wishes, Prayers; but if any one speak louder than his Fellows, he was soon put to silence, disgraced, and crossed in Court Preferments. The <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> desired the

            </p>
            <p>The great Concessions of King <hi>Iames,</hi> towards the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> brought great swarms of Priests and Jesuits into <hi>England,</hi> who were busie in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the People from the Protestant Religion: And a titular Bishop of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> privately came to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to Exercise Episcopal Jurisdiction over the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks</hi> of this Kingdom.</p>

               </gap> That now all the Devils in Hell could not break it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the better to cover their Designs, ordered that the Infanta should be stiled the <hi>Princess of England</hi>; and she was kept no longer in her Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Retirements.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spanish</hi> Match having been long in Treaty, and it being suspected now, that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> did juggle with the States in this, as they formerly did in a Match with that brave Prince <hi>Henry.</hi> Whether the King suspected any such matter, or any whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie came into the Brains of the great Favourite and Prince, to imitate the old Stories of the Knights Errand; but agreed it was (it should seem) that the Prince must go himself very privately into <hi>Spain,</hi> with his Favourite <hi>Buckingham,</hi> under the borrowed Names of <hi>Iack</hi> and <hi>Tom Smith</hi>; and they had the Ports laid so, that none should follow them to give any Notice to the <hi>French</hi> Court, through which they must pass.</p>
            <p>And now many Lords, and other Servants, flock over, that he might appear the Prince of <hi>Great Britain.</hi> Many Treaties were, so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etimes Hope, sometimes Fear, sometimes great Assurance, then all dasht again. At last, after many Heats and Cools, the Prince wrote a Letter to his Father, of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate Despair, not only of not enjoying his Lady, but of never more rerurning.</p>
            <p>Now the folly of this Voyage began to appear, many smiling at the Follies, that were concerned in it; and however the King was a cunning Dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, and shewed much outward Sorrow, as he did for Prince <hi>Henry</hi>'s Death; yet the Court believed little Grief came near his Heart; for that secret Hatred he had of late bore to <hi>Buckingham</hi> (as being
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51050:16"/>
satiated with him,) and his Adorning the Rising Sun, made it generally thought that he would not value the losing his Son, so that <hi>Buckingham</hi> might be lost also: Yet <hi>Buckingham</hi> had so much awe over the King, that he durst not make shew to affect any other.</p>
            <p>One great Reason of the King's Hating of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was, a large Information that he privately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from one <hi>Inniosa,</hi> an Extraordinary Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador from <hi>Spain,</hi> of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s Design on his Person, whether by Poyson, Pistol, Dagger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he could not tell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buckingham</hi> being fully satisfied on several Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the great Hatred the King now bore unto him. He turned as great a Hater of the King; and though the King had more power to Revenge, He had less Courage. And however, the World did believe the King's Inclinations was out of a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ground that he might not Revenge; yet it was no other but a Cowardly Disposition, that durst not adventure. But altho the King lost his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity on <hi>Buckingham,</hi> yet the black Plaister and Powder did shew, <hi>Buckingham</hi> lost not his on the King; and that it was no Fiction, but a Reality, that <hi>Padro Macestria</hi> had formerly told the King.</p>
            <p>And now the Prince returns from <hi>Spain,</hi> and all the fault of the Match not succeeding is laid on <hi>Bristol,</hi> who was Ambassador there. And <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> from an Accused Man in the former Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, came to be the Darling of this Parliament.

            <p>In 1628. (the Fourth year of the King's Reign) the Parliament drew up a Remonstrance against <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham,</hi> Bishop <hi>Neal,</hi> and <hi>Laud,</hi> which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the King, with the Bill of Subsidies; His Majesty told them, <hi>That he expected not such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for his favourable Answer to the Petition of Right; and as for the Grievances, he would take time to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider.</hi> An Information being likewise Exhibited against the Duke in the Star-Chamber. The King, by his express Will and Pleasure, Ordered that it should be taken off the File, and the King resolving to hold up the Duke, Adj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>urned the Parliament to the 20<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> following. But soon after, the Duke was summoned to Answer at a Higher Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, by the means of one <hi>Felton,</hi> a Lieutenant, who stabbed him to the Heart with a Dagger.</p>
            <p>The Parliament were further Adjourned to <hi>Ianu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> 20. in which time the Merchants refusing to pay Custom, had their Goods seized: Complaints thereof being made to the Parliament, the King requires them to pass the promis'd Bill for Tunnage and Poundage; but the Commons answered, That <hi>God's Cause was to be preferred before the King's; and that they would therefore, in the first place, Consult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion</hi>: One Committee being for Religion, and another for Civil Matters. At the last, was a Complaint about the Customs, and the Farmers of the Customs were Challenged.

against them as Delinquents, the King Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed them till the 10<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>March.</hi> The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons enraged thereat, blamed their Speaker for admitting the Mes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>age, and Ordered Sir <hi>I. Elliot</hi> to draw up their Remonstrance; which was in very high Terms, about Tunnage and Poundage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The substance was as followeth,
<list>
                  <item>I. <hi>VVhosoever shall indeavour to Introduce Popery, Arminiauism, or other than Orthodox Opinion, shall be reputed a Capital Enemy to the Kingdom.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. <hi>VVhosoever shall Counsel the taking of Tunnage and Poundage, or shall yield Voluntary, or pay the same, without being granted by Parliament, shall be deemed a Betrayer of, and Enemy to the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of</hi> England.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>These things were so much disliked by the King, that he sent the Usher of the Black Rod to Dissolve them, who was not admitted in: Whereupon, the King with his Guard of Pensioners, were resolv'd to force their Entrance; which the Commons having notice of it, they suddenly went out of the House. And this was the end of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>Some, considering that neither this nor the Two former Parliaments complied with the Humour of the King, or Ministers of State, advised the King never to Call another: And to that end, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Book of <hi>Protects</hi> was Published, and Addrest to the King, proposing some Methods to prevent the Impertinency of Parliaments (as he calls them) from time to time, by the Example of <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. of <hi>France</hi>; who, pretending that the Commons did
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51050:23"/>
encroach too much on the Nobility and Clergy, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd it; and never after suffered the People freely to Elect their Representatives.</p>

               </hi> being consulted about, he pretends, out of some Musty Records, to find an Ancient President of raising a Tax on the Nation, by the Authority of the King alone, for setting out a Navy in case of danger; which was thereupon put in Execution, though no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Discontents in <hi>Scotland</hi> likewise began to increase, and a Book was Printed and Published, charging the King with indirect Proceedings, and having a tendency to the <hi>Rtmish</hi> Belief.

            <p>Several Gentlemen of Quality had refused to pay the Ship-Money; and among the rest, Esquire <hi>Hambden</hi> of <hi>Bucks</hi>; upon which the King refers the whole Business to the Twelve Judges, in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chdelmas Term,</hi> 1636.

The Covenant, the <hi>Scots</hi> were resolved to maintain, and to that purpose, they sent privately for General <hi>Lesley,</hi> and other great Officers from beyond Sea, providing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves likewise with Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After this, they Elect Commissioners for the general Assembly, whom they cite to move the Arch Bishops and Bishops to appear there, as guilty Persons, which being refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the People present a Bill of Complaint against them, to the Presbitery at <hi>Edenburg:</hi> who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly warned them to appear at the next General Assembly.

            <p>The King calls a select Juncto to consult about the <hi>Scots,</hi> where the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> delivered his Mind, in such terms, as afterwards proved his ruine.

            <p>This Letter, as it seems to clear a great portion of Doubts and Suspitions of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Integrity to the Prot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Lords Justices sent Sir <hi>H. Spotswood</hi> from <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> to the King then in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with an Account of all that happened. He dispatched Sir. <hi>I. Stuart,</hi> with In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tructions to the Lords of the Privy Council in <hi>Ireland.</hi> He applied himself to the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> (as being near) for their Assistance. And an Express was sent to the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King being returned out of <hi>Scotland, Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> Summoned both Houses together, and tells them; That he had staid in <hi>Scotland</hi> longer than he expected, yet not fruitlessly; for he had given full Satisfaction to the Nation; but cannot chuse but take Notice of, and wonder at the unexpected Distractions he finds at Home; and then Commends to them the State of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After which, the Commons ordered a Select Committee to draw up a Petition and Remonstrance to the King. The one was against Bishops, and Oppressures in Church Government; and for Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing the Authors of it. And the other contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Miscarriages and Misfortunes, since the beginning of the King's Reign.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:51050:28"/>Not long after happened the Tumults of the <hi>London</hi> Apprentices at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and <hi>Westminster.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>December</hi> 28. The King sends a Message to the Lords, That he would raise Ten Thousand Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers for <hi>Ireland,</hi> provided the Commons would pay them.</p>
            <p>Some time after, the King upon Information, that the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> and five of the House of Commons, <hi>viz. Hollis,</hi> Sir <hi>A. Has<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:51050:29"/>This Act of the King was highly Resented by the House, that the next day, <hi>Ianuary</hi> 5. the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Voted it a Breach of Priviledge: And it it was said in the City, that the King intended Violence against the House of Commons, and came thither with Force to Murther several Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and used threatning Speeches against the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>The next day the <hi>Londoners</hi> came thronging to <hi>Westminster</hi> with Petitions, envying bitterly against some of the Peers; but especially the Bishops, as the Authors of all these Disturbances: Upon which they were so affrighted, that Twelve Bishops ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented themselves from the House of Lords, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a Protestation against all Laws, Orders, Votes, Resolutions, and Determinations, as in themselves Null, and of none Effect, which had Passed, or should Pass, during their Absence. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after which, at a Conference between both Houses, it was agreed, That this Protestation of the Twelve Bishops did extend to the deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching on the Fundamental Priviledges, and Being of Parliaments: And, in a short time, they were Accused of High Treason, Seised, and brought on their Knees at the Lord's Bar: Ten of whom were Comitted to the <hi>Tower</hi>; and the other Two<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now such Numbers of ordinary People, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gathered about <hi>Westminster</hi> and <hi>White-Hall,</hi> that the King (fearing their Intentions) thought fit to withdraw to <hi>Hampton-Court.</hi> The next day, the Five Members were Triumphantly guarded to <hi>Westminster</hi> by a great number of Citizens and Sea-men, with Hundreds of Boats and Barques. About this time the Parliament had notice, that the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> and Coll. <hi>Lunsford,</hi> were raising Troops of Horse at <hi>Kingston,</hi> where the Country
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51050:29"/>
Magazine was lodged: Whereupon they Order, That the Country Sheriffs, Justices of the Peace, and the Trained Bands, shall take care to Secure the Countries and their Magazines. <hi>Lunsford</hi> was Seised, and sent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> but <hi>Digby</hi> escaped beyond Sea.</p>
            <p>The King removed to <hi>Royston,</hi> and <hi>Ianuary</hi> 20. He sends a Message to the Parliament, proposing the Securi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But the King's Desire proved fruitless; for they next moved to have Sir <hi>I. Byron</hi> tnrned out from being Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower</hi>; and, at their nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Sir <hi>I. Coniers</hi> succeeded.</p>

            <p>This Prince began early in Hypocrisie, and Breach of Promise: For the Confirmation of which, to be a certain Truth, there needs no more than to lay the Foundation of the Proof upon his own Words, and solemn Engagements. For in the King's Letter to the Speaker of the House of Commons, just before his Restauration, he has these Words:</p>

We do believe them to be so Vital a part of the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Kingdom, and so necessary for the Government of it, that We well know, neither

            </p>
            <p>This in part demonstrates his Prevarication with Man. Now for his Prevarication with Heaven, we must produce another Paragraph of the same Letter, wherein he uses these flattering Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now, as for his Veneration of Parliaments, or his Zeal for the <hi>Reformed,</hi> or truly any Religion, the Succeeding transactions of his Reign, which are to be related, will plainly make it appear how far those words were from his Heart, when dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his Lips.</p>

            <p>But while the King and his Brother were thus riding Post to ruine the Laws and Religion of the Kingdom, the Discovery of the <hi>Popish Plot</hi> by Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> broke all their Measures for a time, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open their Secret Contrivances for the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Popery and Arbitrary Government<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This Plot was no sooner made known to the King, but he imparts it to the Duke; not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Plot, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or that he knew before, but the News of the Plots being discovered. Upon which they set themselves, with all the Care they could, to stop the further Progress of the Discovery.

All this while, by this seasonable Detection of the King and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Priests and Jesuits, <hi>Oates</hi> himself nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly escaped being Massacred.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:51050:46"/>
               <hi>Oates</hi> finding himself thus Betrayed, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the King, applies himself to Sir <hi>Edmund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury Godfrey,</hi> with a Scheme of the Plot fairly drawn up, by that means to be introduced before the Council, to have the Business there unfolded, which, with much ado, was done, and <hi>Oates</hi> sent for to be Examined at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> where he mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himself with that Courage, that tho he were Brow-beaten, and opposed most strenuously; tho there were many that studied by all the ways and means imaginable to dash and confound him, yet it was impossible; he stood as firm as a Rock, and gave such pregnant Reasons for what he said, that the Council, how unwilling soever to meddle, or stir in his behalf, yet at last were constrained, by the clearness of the Evidence, to grant Warrants for the seisure of several Priests that Night, who were taken and sent to Prison.</p>
            <p>Upon this followed the Assassination and Murther of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> perpetrated by the Countenance and Contrivance, nay, express Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Duke: For proof of which, a little opening of the Cause and Occasion, and a short Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Effects, Consequences, and Events which ensued upon it, will both enlighten us to the Truth of Matters, and confirm our Belief, who were the Authors of, and Acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For, as has been already said, That Gentleman had received an Information upon Oath, from Dr, <hi>Oates,</hi> about a Plot against our Laws, Lives, and Religian; but finding something in the Deposition that reflected upon Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> with whom he had an intimate Acquaintance; he thereupon took an opportunity to let him understand what Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had received, and to tell him, That the only way to justifie his own Innocency, was, To contribute all his Endeavours and Assistance to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

so bloody a Design: But <hi>Coleman,</hi> instead of denying the Truth of those things which Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> related, or offering his endeavours to obstruct the Progress of it, or to defeat the Success of that Plot, not only acknowledged, That there was a Conspiracy against our Laws, Liberties, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but it was advanced so far, and seconded by Persons of that Quality in the Nation and Figure in the Government, there was no possibility to give a Lett or Dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What more could have been done by a Protestant Prince, to destroy his Protestant Subjects, and advance the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Cause? When this Parliament Sate, the King pursued his old Method of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Lips what was farthest from his Heart, and being in the House of Lords, he there tells Both Houses a plausible Story, how he had consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Exclusion of the Popish Lords from their Seats in Parliament, to the Execution of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Criminals, both upon the Score of the Plo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For as to the Exclusion of the Popish Lords, he knew it was what he could not avoid, unless he would have absolutely thrown off his Protestant Mask, which he was sensible it was not seasonable for him so to do.

            <p>And then as for the Removal of his dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it was done after a long and deep Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon these Considerations. First, That the Duke being out of the way, might stop the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Examination of the Plot, in Relation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and thereby one of the chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Notwithstanding these things, the Parliament, not being to be deluded by all those seeming Acts of Protestant Grace, took little notice of those G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>dy Trappings of the Kings Discourse, but fell briskly to work upon the Plot, and the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to which purpose they made choice of a Secret Committee to pursue that Business, and laid all other Considerations aside, but those of securing the Nation against <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Government</hi>; in order whereunto, they began to think of bringing the Lords and others in the <hi>Tower</hi> to their Tryals: And upon a Report of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51050:51"/>
their Committee, of the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Letters, wherein it appeared what great Joy had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at <hi>Rome,</hi> for the Dukes Conversion, even to draw Tears from his Holynesses Eyes, with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Papers, discovering much of the Court Intreague; with <hi>Rome.</hi> They Voted the Hopes of his coming to the Crown, to be one of the chief Causes of the Popish Plot; and ordered a Bill to disinable him to Inherit the Imperial Crown of the Realm.</p>
            <p>These Proceedings were of so high a Nature, and so directly tending to the overthrow of that Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, which the King and the Duke had been so long erecting, that it was thought requisite to Treat them wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h all the Art and Subtilty imaginable, which produced Two of the greatest Master pieces that ever were acted by the Conspirators ever since their first designing Popery and <hi>French</hi> Tyranny. The first was, To blind and couzen the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, by seeming to shew an utter dislike of all former Councils that had brought the Nation to the Condition it was in. In pursuance of which, the old Council was Dissolved, and the greatast Sticklers against the Plot, and for the Protestant Religion, chosen in their room: to the end that if any Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages happened, they might be all laid to their Charge; or th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t Miscarriages might receive a more Candid Interpretation, as being done by such good Men against whose Fidelity the Nation had no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            <p>The next Device was, To turn the whole Plot, and the Odium of it, upon the Protestants, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Notion of Presbyterian and Phanaticks; which is so well known needs no repeating,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:51050:51"/>But in the midst of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Ane now the King having laid aside the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and freed his Instruments <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> for opposing it, was severely Reprimanded in Council, with a Wonder, How any Person that sate at that Board, durst so bolply affront his Royol Highness? For the Face of Affairs was changed, and the King was now swimming in his own Element again. Only it was strange, that he was no more concerned to see the strain of the whole Kingdom run against him. For notwithstanding all his Industry to have brought in his Band of Pensioners again, it was found, the new Chosen Parliament, which was by this tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet such was the awe which the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity and legality of the Charter had upon the Judge, that the Fountain of Justice was forced to shift his Chief Justice, till he could fix upon one that durst to adventure to pronounce Sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it: Which, as it was the greatest Invasion that could be against the ancient and fundamental Constitution of the Kingdom; so it plainly laid open the King`s pious Intentions of Governing by Law; which, according to the new Interpretation of the Court, was the downright subverting of all that was most Sacred and Valuable in the Nation, to the end the King might have it in his Power to violate the electing of a Parliam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And that this was his end, was apparent by the Consequences; for when once the King, by the overthrow of the Charter, had made sure of his own Sheriffs and Juries; Heavens! How were the Laws of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom</hi> wrested by misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation? How were the Precepts even of Morality it self, transversed?

            <p>Such were the Violences of the Court at that time, in defiance of Justice, as if all fear of giving account to future Parliaments, had been thrown off, or that they never intended to be troubled with them more, till they had framed the Nation into such a posture, as to chuse such Members as would not only forgive such Villanies, but go sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers with them in the spoil of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But then followed the Barbarous and Horrid Murther of the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> which how far it could be laid to the King's Charge, we shall not here pretend to determine, tho it seem somewhat strange, that the King could find no other Morning to accompany his Brother to the <hi>Tower,</hi> but that very Morning that the Earl was Murthered, will, no doubt very much augment the Suspition of future Ages; and it will be as odly looked upon, that when Letters and Proposals were sent to some great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons near the King, <hi>That if his Majesty would but grant a Pardon to Two or Three Men that shyuld be named, when the Favour was granted, the whole My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Contrivance should be discovered, and the Contrivers and Actors be particularly derected</hi>; such a Proposal should be slighted and neglected.</p>
            <p>Now, after all these Tricks and Stratagems of the King, to introduce Tyranny and Slavery, to stifle the <hi>Popish Plot,</hi> by throwing it upon his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Subjects; after such an obstinate and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast Conjunction with the Sworn Enemy of the Nation, the <hi>French</hi> King, for the Subversion of our

He came into <hi>England</hi> full freighted with his Mothers Religion, and her Malice to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Nation; but wore at first the same Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard Mask of Protestantism which his Brother did. But tho he were fitter for the Business they both designed, yet he understood not how to manage it so well; so that had he been the Elder Brother, we may undoubtedly presume to say, he would have been much sooner thrown out of the Saddle, greatly to the saving both the Honour and Treasure of the Nation, and the Life of many a worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and true Lover of his Country.</p>

            <p>And as he was an early Traytor to his Brother' so he did no less treacherously attempt the disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his first Wife. For finding her extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Chastity to be such, that he could not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to her Bed, but upon the lawful score of Matrimony, he was at last Married to her, but so very privately, that only the King, and some very few Friends were privy to it: After which, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that his Brother's Restauration was fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in <hi>England,</hi> under pretence that it would be more for his own, and the Honour and Interest of his Brother, to Marry with some great Princess, that would both enrich and strengthen them by the largeness of her Dowry, and the graatness of her

Relations, he would have taken an Occasion from the privacy of the Nuptials, to deny her being his Wife` and disavow all Contracts and Ceremonies of Marriage between them: But the King detesting so much buseness, as being himself a witness of the Marriage, would not suffer the Lady to be so hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously abused; but constrained him, after great reluctancy, to declare it publickly to all the World A happy Providence for <hi>England,</hi> which by that' Conjunction blest us with two <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Certain it is, that the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have pulled off his Protestant Vizard, nor have declared himself of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion so soon, had he not been thereto necessitated by a Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem of the King his Brother; for the Papists ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a long time waited for the Accomplishment of the King's Oathes and Promises for restoring their Religion; and having annually contributed large Sums of Money towards the effecting of it, at length grew impatiently sullen. and would advance no more, unless the King, or the Duke, would openly declare themselves for Popery: Which the King thinking no way seasonable for him to do,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51050:61"/>
and not being able by all his Arguments and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to prevail with his Brother to do it, he (at length) bethought himself of this Project, which was, To get the Queen to write a Letter, intimating her Intention to withdraw into a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery; which Letter was to be left upon her Closet-Table, that her Priests, as it was concerted before-hand, might there seize it, and seeing the Contents of it, carry it forthwith to the Duke. Upon which, the Duke being Jealous left the King, upon the Queens relinquishing her Husband, might be induced to marry again, and thereby deprive him of the hopes of succeeding, than which there was nothing which he thirsted after more, upon obtaining a previous Assurance, that in case he declared himself a Papist, she would not withdraw, immediately pulled o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Only here was the Difference between the Two Brothers, That the King thought to ruine his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by main force, and the fair hand of Victory; but the Duke hoping to kill two Birds with one Stone, made it his business, at the same time, to ruine the Enemy by force, and his own Country by treachery.

            <p>At the same time, he ordered <hi>Dangerfield</hi> to be very careful of what he communicated to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who were to be Witnesses in that new Plot, lest he should be caught in the Subordination, and so bring a terrible Odium upon the Catholicks, and make himself uncapable of any further Service.</p>
            <p>Then for Encouragement in the Prosecution of the Sham Plot, the Duke promised, that he would take Care that Money should not be wanting, and ordered him, with all the Expedition the Thing would allow, to make a Discovery to the King.

they were endeavouring to get some Bills to pass for the Security of their Religion, in case of a-<hi>Popish</hi> Successor, <hi>That whatever they intended, or prepared against the Papists, should light upon others.</hi> Which, tho` it stopt him from taking the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of any new Bills, yet he was so just to his Word, in behalf of the <hi>Papists,</hi> that he pour`d all the Rigour of the Penal Laws against the Papists, upon the Protestants in that Kingdom, under the Name of Dissenters, whom he Persecuted with that insatiable Violence, as if according to his own Expression, he had fully concluded, That it would never be well with <hi>Scotland,</hi> till all the South-side of <hi>Ferth</hi> were made a Hunting Field. For indeed that was the true intent and drift of all his envenom`d Prosecutions of those People, as well in <hi>England,</hi> as in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in hopes by so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere an Exasperation, they would have broken out into open Rebellion, and so have given him a fair opportunity to have rooted them from the Earth by the Sword: Which was evident from another Saying of his; for that having one day given his Opinion of sober Dissenters, and setting them forth, as he thought, in their Colours, he concluded, <hi>That if he might have his VVish, he would have them all turn Rebels, and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to Arms.</hi> Which, tho` it shewed his good Will yet whether it were so prudently spoken by a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that had so little, either of Courage or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct as himself, is a question, unless he thought he cou'd subdue them with the Spiritual Weapons of the Popes Excommunications and Curses: Nor did he at the same time remember that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Oppressions of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Inquisition, tore from the Dominions of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> all the Seven United Provinces, notwithstanding all that <hi>D`A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For which Reason he was resolv'd to be better provided henceforward for the Security of the Nation; and to croud in his Popish Officers into Commands, under the Notion of Persons of Loyalty, and therefore such whose Persons he was neither to expose to Disgrace by a Removal, nor himself to suffer the want of: Cautions and wary of Removing his Popish Commanders, but mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not at all to remove the Fears and Jelousies of the Nation.</p>
            <p>However his plausible Promises, and this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Nccessity of augmenting his Standing Forces, were urg'd upon the Parliament, as undeniable Reasons for more Mony. So great a Confidence the King had either in the Awe which he had upon the Parliament, or that they were so Blind that they could not see through his Cobweb Pretenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But it seems King <hi>Iames</hi> was so confidently as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd, That the Bands of Friendship and Alliance between him and the <hi>French</hi> King were so Indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluble, That wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

subservient to those Wicked Designs, and thought it more Honourable to be true to the Nation whom they Represented, than Serviceable to the Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Tyranny, he laid them aside, as things no longer useful for him.</p>
            <p>And therefore like a man cased with their just demial of his Demands, he resolves the utter Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of <hi>English</hi> Parliaments, the only Remora`s of his ungodly Projects, by compleating the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchising of all the Cities and Corporations throughout the Nation, so fairly begun in his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther`s Reign, to make way for the Introduction of a <hi>French</hi> Parliament, That should at once have surrender`d all the Ancient Liberty of the Kingdom, and the whole Power of the Government into his hands.

            </p>
            <p>These severe Proceedings against the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> werd the Violation of that part of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, wherein he promised the Preservation of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Government, as Established by Law.</hi> But the Barbarous usage of the Gentlemen of both <hi>Maudlin Colledges,</hi> was an unsanctified breach of another part of his Declaration, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he no less solemnly engaged to maintain the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants <hi>in all their Properties and Possessions as well of Church as Abby-Lands, as of all other their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties whatsoever.</hi> Notwithstanding all which, how he turned these Gentlemen out of their Legal Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51050:76"/>
And this <hi>Peters</hi> looked upon as one of his great Master-pieces, as appears by a Letter of his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the <hi>French</hi> King's Confessor, Father <hi>La Chese,</hi> wherein he had the vauntidg expression, <hi>I bave gained a great point, in perswading the King to place our Fathers in</hi> Magdalen Colledge <hi>in</hi> Oxford, <hi>where they will be able to tutor the young Schollars in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was it thought sufficient to turn the Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etors out of their Freeholds, but under pretence of Disobedience to the King's Commands, they were also made uncapable of any Eccles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>tical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, or of the Exercise of Holy Orders, and deprived of all those other ways and means of Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood, for which their Education had qualified them. Which as it was a piece of Inhumanity without Parallel, so it was a plain Demonstration of the main drift and design of the King and his Popish Furies, first to draw the Protestant Clergy into the snare of Disobedience, and then under pretence of Obstinacy and Stubborness, totally to suppress and silence them.</p>
            <p>And yet after all this, for the King so publickly to give himself the Lie, by proclaiming to all the World, as he did, such a notorious Untruth, as <hi>That he had never invaded the Property of any Man since his coming to the Crown,</hi> was such a piece of Dissimulation, that <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> himself, with all the Irreligion laid to his Charge, was never guilty of. Unless his Father Confessor designed it for a Miracle to be Recorded among Popish Wonders, That he who had done nothing else from the beginning of his Reign, but invaded the Liberties and Properties of his Subjects should be so confident as to deny it. But whatever, through the frailty of his memory, he had till then forgot, he was resolved, it seems, for the future, to make
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51050:77"/>
amends for his Omission. To which purpose he was now provided with such a Gun-powder-Plot, that had it taken Effect, would, ere a few months had gone about, have blown up all the Properties of the whole Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> without Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any Person that had ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dals and shaved Crowns.</p>
            <p>This was that cunning Declaration for Liberty of Conscience, whereby he undertook to dispense with the Laws, by the sole vertue of his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. An Attempt wherein his Brother had mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried, being forced to surreeder up, and Cancel the Illegal Contrivance he had prepared for a Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. But King <hi>Iames</hi> pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ed up with the great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits he had in Person performed upon <hi>Hounslow-Heath,</hi> and the Glorious shew his Army made there, Rendezvouzed at the same time in the same place, to add terror to his Commands, resolved to make all Opposition to bow the <hi>Knee</hi> to <hi>Baal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In pursuance of those Resolutions, he Orders his Declaration to be Printed, requires the Bishops to cause it to be destributed through all their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, and to take Care that it should be Read in all the Churches and Chappels throughout the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Bishops Petition the King, setting forth the Illegality, and the ill Consequences of it to the whole Nation, both in Church and State; and beg the King not to insist upon the Reading it. This so in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ensed <hi>Peters</hi> and the rest of the furious Hotspurs, and oonsequently provoked the King to that degree, That the Court-Lawyers are presently consulted, who adjudge the Petition Tumultuary and Libellous; and thereupon the Archbishop of

               <hi>Canterbury,</hi> together with the Bishop of <hi>Asaph, Ely, Chichester, Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells, Peterborough,</hi> and <hi>Bristol,</hi> are first sent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and then Arraigned and Tryed for Mutiners against the King's Popish Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, being Charged with an Information for Publishing a Seditious, Pernitious, and Scandalous Libel. But notwithstanding all that the King's Council, and the C. J. <hi>Wright,</hi> and <hi>Alibone</hi> the Papist could do, Judge <hi>Holloway,</hi> and Judge <hi>Powel,</hi> to the Eternal praise, stuck so close to their Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Principles, aud so strongly oppos'd the King's Dispensing Power, for which they were turn'd out the next day, that the Bishops were acquitted, to the general Joy and Satisfaction of the whole Nation; and particularly the Soldiers upon <hi>Houn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slow-Heath,</hi> whose Shouts and Acclamations upon the News of their Acquital, were so harsh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant in the King's Ear, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rom thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he began to wish he had more <hi>Irish,</hi> and fewer <hi>English</hi> in his Army.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding this Fatal Blow, the most undanted High Commissioners drove on furiously, sending forth their Mandates to the Chancellors, Arch-Deacons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the several Diocesses, to send them an ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>orcing the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument yet further, by saying, <hi>That it was his Principle, to do as he would be done by, therefore would rather dye a Thousand Deaths, than do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Certainly therefore, since it was for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, that the Contrivance was set on foot, it argues, that his Conscience was under the most dreadful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to his Popish Confessors, or that his Zeal was no less strangely Govern'd by an Imperious Woman, that for the sake of Popery, he should consent to a Conspiracy against his own Flesh and Blood.

            <p>In the next place, about the time that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception was pretended, Father <hi>Peters</hi> was taken into the Privy-Council, to give the Report all the Favour imaginable at the Board, to prevent the being of it Contestee, or if it were to satisfie all manner of Doubts, and so incite the Lords to make such Orders, as the Case required, which had not been so proper for the King, or the rest

of the Popish Lords, who knew not so well what to insist upon.

            <p>Nor was it less observable, that at the same time the Bishops were lock'd up safe, that they might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To which may be added, That at the first, the King himself, who had most Reason to know, did not seem to give Credit to the thing, or at least, was very doubtful of it; and therefore, when the News was first brought him, as one that rather wished it true, than thought it to bè real; he made answer to the Messenger, <hi>If 'twere so, it was very odd,</hi> till finding, that the Lady of <hi>Loretto</hi> would take Bribes, and had espoused the blessed Design, he was bound to believe, that his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in Law`s Prayers, and the Diamond Bodkin had prevailed; and that his Royal Consort had been impregnated by an Apparition, like the Mother of <hi>Damaratus,</hi> King of <hi>Sparta.</hi>

            <p>For now the Nation, no longer able to brook such a deluge of illegal Oppressions, and the whole Body of the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom, observing such a general Desolation impending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Religion, Lives and Fort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51050:82"/>
the dismal Consequences thereof to these Three Kingdoms, and at last to himself; I cannot but regret the Fate of those Princes, that abondon their true Interest, Reason, Conscience, and Honour to <hi>Iesuitick</hi> Councils, and enslave themselves to a Party, justly abominated by the better part of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church it self, for their gross Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon Religion, Morality, and all that's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred among Men. When I look back to the many Tragedies, acted by that Fraternity, both in this, and the last Age, scarce a Kingdom, or State in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> where their Villanies have not come up to the utmost reach of depraved Nature. When I call to mind the horrid Desolations, Murders and Wars, they have been instrumental of, in the most remote parts of the World; witness some Millions of Souls in <hi>Iapan,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Asia,</hi> Sacrific`d not many Years ago, to their Ambition and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues, under the Notion of propagating the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Faith; I say, when I consider all these things, I am the less surprized with the dismal Effects of their Councils in <hi>England,</hi> since the same Fate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends them every where.

And I may add, That the unaccountable Doctrine of <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> as it was the Source

Now were the few <hi>Protestants,</hi> who liv`d disperst, left to shift for themselves. In the mean time, the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> (who still had the Sword undemanded, and undisposed of to any other) is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues new Commissions, not only to the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi> who had some Estates, bnt to all, who were willing to stand up for the Cause, that were Men of broken Fortunes, and worse Fame, that could influence the Rabble, and raise Companies, only with this <hi>Salvo,</hi> that they should maintain them for three Months, at their own Cost and Charges, and then they should have their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions given them; by which it was adjudged,

But these Commissions (or rather Encouragements) being very many; for every one that could get about Sixty <hi>Kearns,</hi> or Country Fellows, to joyn with them, and own him as their Captain, immediately strutted, and looked very big, and was honoured by the Name of Captain; so that it was nothing strange to have 20 or 30 Companies in a County, and these the noted Vagabonds, and Cow-stealers; so that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently the Captains (many of which had not Three Cows of their own) had several Hundreds of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle driven into Nookes and By-corners; and all that were branded were sure to go to Pot, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Horn (as they called it) spoke <hi>English:</hi> The rest were sent into other remote Counties, to the Officers there, and those again sent there stolen Cattle in exchange for the other (which was done to elude a Proclamation from the Lord-Deputy, on the many and daily Complaints he received on the Account of the stolen Cattle) requiring all Officers, as well as others, to be aiding and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to recover the stolen Cattle, and to punish the Offenders, which passed for Currant: For it was well if a <hi>Protestant</hi> could go safe to the next G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51050:83"/>
the rest, for a Bribe of 5 or 6 <hi>l,</hi> would be got by some of the Soldiers, who would swear lustily they were forced to promise much to the Spy; yet no sooner (on the delivery of the greater part of the Cattle, and the Money received) but besure in a Night or Two, the Cattle were again stolen. Thus the merry Drovers (as they called themselves) va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued not to joyn, about 60 or 80, or an 100 in one Party, and force away what Cattle they had a mind to: So that sometimes an Hundred Sheep would scarce seed the Drivers, and their Families, and Friends; and a Purchase of an Hundred was only fit to be divided among them and their Crew, into Lors and Parts. And now these new raised Forces were almost half Armed out of the Stores, the rest were pretty well fitted for Pikes, made in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and the Priests and Fryars, Commanded (on Obedience to the Holy See) that no Person what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever should appear at Mass without his long Skeene, and half-Pike, which accordingly was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; and one Person, who had not ore Foot of Land, but what he Farmed from an <hi>English</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, had 12 Dozen of each made for himself and Tenants; an Account whereof was sent to the Government, but no notice taken.</p>
            <p>And now it was thought fit, that these new rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Forces should betake themselves to Garrisons, which was s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now was it plain, that this Army was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to fight with Butter-flies, and that the Lives of all the Protestants that stayed, were in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent danger.
