         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <salute>Brother Bastwick.</salute>
            <p>IN regard none of the Independent party hath taken upon
them to answer your Booke of no Manners. I your Sister
a Member of the Church of England, have undertaken the
taske, it being fittest for a Foole to answer a Foole in his
Folly.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou say in the first page of your <hi>Idle Pamphlet</hi>
you have <hi>taught Leiv. Coll: Lilburn</hi> (so much)
<hi>manners.</hi> That J in answer unto you say, You
have left your selfe never a whit: For you have
gone beyond the bounds of <hi>Modesty</hi> and <hi>Civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
(In your seventeenth page) you have reviled your
<hi>Creator,</hi> in the despising of his creatures. Secondly, The
last Petitioners for the Liberty of the subject, you call them
<hi>Gastly, Vgly faces, having Complexions like the Belly of a
Toad.</hi> O blasphemous lie! For God himselfe saith of his
works they are all very good. In page Six, you say <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
shit out</hi> Independent Ministers. Brother, I feare you are


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56333:3"/>
one of his <hi>treatles:</hi> For its like you are of his very nature,
you know so well what he doth; Why are you so foolish
to find fault with the <hi>Sucking Apothecary,</hi> seeing you your
selfe order the Pipe? Brother, I thinke you have scoured
your <hi>Pate,</hi> as cleane of <hi>Wit,</hi> and your <hi>Tongue</hi> of <hi>Manners,</hi>
as some doe their <hi>Closse Stooles</hi> after the sound of your <hi>Gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</hi>
A <hi>Taylor, or a Controwler of the dreeping pans</hi> are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
trades then a <hi>Milke-Wench,</hi> that milkes her Cowes back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
and lets them <hi>Scomer in the Paile.</hi> I hope you will
not condemne me, seeing I am so apt a <hi>Scholler</hi> of yours to
learne your owne <hi>Language,</hi> at the first teaching: For it is
the manner of <hi>Schoolmasters,</hi> to commend their forward
<hi>puples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I thought to gratifie my <hi>Master</hi> with a <hi>Cap</hi> and a <hi>Cockes
Fether,</hi> with <hi>a Bell, a Ladle</hi> and a <hi>Pudding;</hi> because he is
more fit for a <hi>Vice in a Morrice,</hi> then to be neere a <hi>Wise
Councell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No marvell (Dr, <hi>Bastwick</hi>) you have so impudently bely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Independents</hi> (as you call them) to say <hi>They purpose to
put downe all the Nobility and Gentry in the Kingdome</hi> (page
21.) when as your owne <hi>Conscience</hi> can witnesse: they are
the readiest people, to give <hi>God</hi> his due and <hi>Cesar</hi> his.)</p>
            <p>Sir, In the latter end of your railing Pamphlet, you say
that <hi>there is no Kindred so good, that hath not either a Whore or a
Knave in it. So it is impossible in such a great Councell as the
Parliament is, but they should have some Ninnyes and Groles,
and men that have no more wit, then will reach from their Nose
to their mouths.</hi> If I had beene a man, and had spoken such
words in this Age, I should never have lived to come to so
great an <hi>honour,</hi> as to have a <hi>Gray Beard,</hi> and a <hi>Set of thin teeth</hi>
of Gods placing: But I should surely be <hi>Hanged,</hi> and well I
had deserved it: For it is as great <hi>Treason</hi> as any is, to make


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56333:3"/>
a Kingdome so void of wisedome, as to make choise of
<hi>Naturalls</hi> to sit in so great a <hi>Court</hi> as a <hi>Parliament</hi> is: Oh that
the wisedome of the <hi>Parliament</hi> would consider what you
have done, for you seeme to vindicate the one party, and
revile the other: and so divide the House. Then, how
shall it stand, where workes of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> are,
they will justifie themselves, and have no need of a <hi>Foule-mouthed
railing-Lyar,</hi> to mantaine them, for that is a great
disgrace.</p>
            <p>Brother, the number of those honest people (whom you
call <hi>Independents</hi>) is so greatly increased, and so surely groun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded
are they upon the <hi>Rock Christ,</hi> that its neither you, nor
I, nor all our <hi>Brethren the Presbyterians,</hi> nor the <hi>Gates of Hell,</hi>
that shall ever remove them, For <hi>the rage of man shall turne to
the praise of God</hi> (as it is said in the 76. <hi>Psalme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are these the fruits of our Fasts, <hi>to fast for strife and debate,
and to smite with the fist of wickednesse?</hi> for even so it appeares
by those <hi>lying-railing-Pamphlets,</hi> which daily are suffered
to come forth to make <hi>Gods People</hi> odious: but that will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
prevaile; You call them <hi>Independents,</hi> but I thinke by
their Profession and practises, we may judge them to be as
cheife <hi>Dependants,</hi> as any <hi>Presbyterian</hi> in the world. Brother
take their Profession, according as I your Sister have
taken it from their owne mouths, <hi>That they depend first up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the great power of Heaven and Earth, upon the Father, Son
and Holy Ghost for protection, the Word for their direction, life,
and rule to walke in and by.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That they depend upon
the Civill Magistrate, and submit to all godly Civil Lawes.</hi>
And good brother, give me leave to tell you, that <hi>Gide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Armie</hi> had the <hi>exercise</hi> of their <hi>Tongues,</hi> as well as the <hi>use</hi>
of their <hi>hands,</hi> see (Iudges 6. and 7. and 8. And the Lord
prospered them, and wrought a great deliverance for them.


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56333:4"/>
And therefore why should you envie at the <hi>Lievtenant Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell</hi>
or any other for preaching in the <hi>Armie.</hi> Have Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
no Soules? Surely I thinke the very worst of them
have, as much as you have <hi>Conscience:</hi> But there is a God
above all, and he is greater then all.</p>
            <p>Brother. The man of God was not seduced by wicked
<hi>Jeroboam,</hi> but was deceived by a <hi>Prophet,</hi> that came to
him with a lie in his mouth, as if it had beene from the word
of the <hi>Lord,</hi> (see 1 King. 13. 10.) So this our <hi>Parliament</hi>
was not seduced by the wicked <hi>Prelates,</hi> and I pray, they
may not be deceived by you, and those wee call good men
and <hi>Prophets</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> that <hi>come with lies in their mouthes</hi>
(as it were) from <hi>the word of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Bastwick,</hi> surely your cause is bad, for a good
cause will make the owner better, not worse. I should have
wondred greatly at your great and painefull labour so much
(in your evill way) for our <hi>Brethren</hi> the <hi>Presbyterian Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi>
but that they themselves are so helpelesse (in thump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the Pues and managing their businesse almost after your
manner) that the most of them have scarred away their <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers:</hi>
And it is not the sent of the <hi>Independents pissing</hi> and
<hi>scomering</hi> (as you speake) in their <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Pulpits:</hi>
And if you meane the <hi>Separates</hi> also, that is as grosse a lye as
to say <hi>The Independents can smell the good cheere out of England
into other Countryes,</hi> For surely God never made men
such long Noses, and the Separates never come neere your
Pues to trouble you.</p>
            <p>You say <hi>the Independents have demanded their money of you
which they gave you,</hi> and that is false, some [of them] im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
me severall times, and I brought you three or foure
pounds at a time, which was never demanded, and many
friends more did the like, beside my selfe. Brother I am


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56333:4"/>
sory you have not remembred to be thankfull, nor forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to lye. Gods Children are <hi>Children that will not lye,</hi> So
I rest, your <hi>Sister</hi> but no <hi>Independent.</hi> Therefore charge
them not with my worke. I have sent you but two <hi>Letters
of my name,</hi> not for <hi>feare</hi> have I omitted them, but meerly
for <hi>Modestie sake:</hi> for truly I <hi>am ashamed of my Masters teaching,</hi>
Deare Sir, If you happen to <hi>conjure</hi> for me, you shall never
find me in a <hi>Bulls Hide,</hi> It may be you may in a <hi>Cowes.</hi>
