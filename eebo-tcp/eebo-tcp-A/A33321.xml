            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

youth. And <hi>Caesar</hi> was not contented to retire himself in safety inthose stormy times, but came and made suite to the People for the Priesthood which was then void, when he had scant any haire on his face: but by <hi>Syllas</hi> means he suffered a repulse, who was so irritated here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that he determined to have killed him; and when some of <hi>Syllas</hi> Friends told him, that it was to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to put so young a man to Death, he answered, <hi>That they did not consider that there were many</hi> Marius's <hi>in that one Boy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> being informed of his danger, secretly fled from <hi>Rome,</hi> and hid himself a long time amongst the <hi>Sabines,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His flight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> wandering from one place to another, yet at length he fell into the hands of a party of <hi>Syllas</hi> Souldiers who soughtfor him, but he bribed their Captain with two Talents, and so escaped. Then went he unto the Sea side, and taking Ship, he passed into <hi>Bythinia</hi> unto King <hi>Nicomedes.</hi> And after a while, he took Sea again,<note place="margin">He is taken by Pirates.</note> and fell into the hands of some Pirates, who at that time kept all the Sea-coast, with a great Fleet. They asking him twenty Talents for his Ransom, <hi>Caesar</hi> laughed them to scorne, as not knowing what a man they had taken, and of himself promised them fifty Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and sent some of his men to get him this money, so that he was almost left alone amongst these Theeves, which were the cruellest Butchers in the world, having onely one of his Friends and two Slaves with him.</p>
            <p>Thus he continued thirty eight dayes amongst them, not as a Prisoner, but rather waited upon as a Prince by them: For he boldly exercised himself amongst them<note place="margin">His bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> in their sports: He would make Orations and call them to gether to hear them, and if they seemed not to understand or regard them, he would call them Blockheads and Beasts, and laughing, would threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to hang them, and they took all in good part, thinking that it proceeded from his Boyish simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56425:3"/>When his Ransome was come, he paid it them and so was dismssied; and presently arming and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note place="margin">He is de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>livered.</note> some Ships out of the Haven of <hi>Miletum,</hi> he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed these Theeves, and finding them yet at Anchor, he took most of them, and got a great Booty, and carryed there persons to the City of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and there imprisoned them, whilst himself went to <hi>Jumus,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Asia,</hi> to whom the execution of these Pirates did belong. But he desiring to get the money, because there was good store of it, said, that he would consider of these Prisoners at better leasure. <hi>Caesar</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon returned back to <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and there hung up all<note place="margin">He cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Pirates.</note> these Theeves openly upon the Crosse, as he often had threatened that he would doe, when they thought that he was but in jest.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Sylla</hi>'s power began to decay, <hi>Caesars</hi> Friends wrote to him to returne to <hi>Rome:</hi> But he first went to <hi>Rhodes</hi> to study there for a time, under the Tuition of <hi>Apollonius,</hi> an honest man and excellent <hi>Rethori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His studies.</note> whose Schollar also <hi>Cicero</hi> had been. <hi>Caesar</hi> had an excellent gift to speak well naturally, which was much holpen by his Studies, so that he was very elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and might have been second to none, but that he applied himself rather to follow the Wars, and to mannage great matters than to pleading of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
            <p>When he was returned again to <hi>Rome,</hi> he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">His return to <hi>Rome.</hi>

Besides, he ever kept a good Table, and<note place="margin">He grows popular.</note> fared well, and was very liberall, which much encreased his estimation with the people. And his enemies, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming that when he could not hold out that charge and<note place="margin">And is feared.</note> expence, the favour of the People would quickly decay, they suffered him to go on, till by degrees he was grown very great, and powerfull. So that though some of them foresaw that his power would at last turne to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56425:4"/>
destruction of the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet now they knew not how to provent it. Indeed <hi>Cicero</hi> was the first man, who mistrusting his dealings, found out his subtilty and malice, which he cuningly cloaked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a shew of curtesie, and familiarity: Yet (said he) <hi>When I consider how finely he combeth his fair bush of haire, and how smooth it lyeth, and that I see him scratch his Head with one finger, my mind gives me then, that such a man should not be so wicked as to designe the ruine of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first time that he made proofe of the good will of the People was, when he stood in competition with <hi>Pompey</hi> to be chosen a Collonel of a thousand Foot Souldiers, and carryed it against him; but a more manifest proof of it was at the Deathof his Aunt <hi>Julia,</hi> the Wifeof <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the elder. For then he solemnly made an Oration in her commendations in the Market place, and at her Buriall, did boldly shew forth the Images of <hi>Marius,</hi> which was the first time that they were seen after <hi>Syllas</hi> Victory over him, at which time <hi>Marius</hi> and all his partakershad been proclaimed Traytors and enemies to the Commonwealth. And whereas some cryed out upon <hi>Caesar</hi> for doing it, the Poeple on the other side applaudded and thanked him him for it. And whereas there was an ancient custome that the <hi>Romans</hi> used to make Funerall Orations in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of old Ladys, but not of young Women, <hi>Caesar</hi> was the first that praised his own Wife in an Oration at her funerall, which much engaged the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to him, seeing him of so kind, and loving a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Shortly after he was made Treasure under <hi>Antistius</hi>
               <note place="margin">His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment.</note> 
               <hi>Vetus,</hi> the <hi>Praetor,</hi> for which he ever after honoured him, so that when he himselfe came to be <hi>Praetor,</hi> he made his Son Treasurer under him, and when he came out of that Office, he married his third Wife, whom was <hi>Pompeia,</hi> and married his Daughter <hi>Cornelia</hi> which he had by his first Wife, to <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ingratiated, himself with the People by disbursing a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56425:4"/>
great summe of his own money in mending the <hi>Appian</hi> way, when he was made Overseer thereof: as also for that, when he was chosen an <hi>Aedile,</hi> he shewed the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the pastime of three hundred and twenty couple of Sword Players, and exceeded all others in the sumptuousnesse of his Feasts and sports which he made for the delight of the People, which made them daily to give him new Offices by way of requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.</p>
            <p>Not long after the High Priest <hi>Metellus</hi> dyed, and <hi>Isauricus</hi> and <hi>Catulus,</hi> two of the chiefest men, and of the greatest authority in <hi>Rome,</hi> contended for the place: <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> also presented himself to the People and sued for it, and <hi>Catulus</hi> fearing the event, sent a great summe of money to <hi>Caesar,</hi> to procure him to leave off his suite: <hi>Caesar</hi> sent him word, that he would disburse a greater summe than that to maintaine the suit against him: and when the Day of Election came, his Mother bringing him to the Doore, <hi>Caesar</hi> weeping kissed her and said,<note place="margin">His ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He is made High Priest.</note> 
               <hi>Mother, This day thou shalt see thy Son chief Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>or bannished from</hi> Rome; and accordingly he carred it by the suffrages of the People, insomuch as the Senate and Noble men were all affraid of him, judging that from henceforth he would make the People do what he pleased.</p>
            <p>Afterwards <hi>Caesar</hi> going into the Senate to cleere him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of some accusations that were brought against him, the Senate keeping him somewhat longer than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the People come to the door and called for him, bidding them let him out. Whereupon <hi>Cato</hi> fearing an insurraction of the Poor and needy persons, who put all their hopes in <hi>Caesar,</hi> moved, that a frank distribution of Corne for a moneth should be made amongst them, which indeed put the Commonwealth to the charge of fifty five hundred Myriades, but it quenched the present danger, and did happly scatter the best part of <hi>Caesars</hi> strength, and that at such time when he was made <hi>Praetor,</hi> and had thereby opportunity of doing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56425:5"/>
much mischief. Yet all the time of that Office, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attempted to make any alteration in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.<note place="margin">His Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</note>
            </p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Clodius</hi> was suspected of too much familiarity whith <hi>Pompeia</hi> wherefore <hi>Caesar</hi> put her away.<note place="margin">He puts away his wife.</note> The Government of <hi>Spain</hi> being falne unto <hi>Caesar</hi> as he was <hi>Praetor,</hi> his Creditors came with great importunity cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for their debts: But he being unable to satisfy them, went to <hi>Crassus,</hi> the richest man in <hi>Rome;</hi> who stood in need of <hi>Caesars</hi> boldness and courage to withstand <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peys</hi> greatness, who became his surety to his greediest Creditors, for eight hundred and thirty Talents, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was suffered to depart to his Province.</p>
            <p>As he passed over the <hi>Alps</hi> he came to a little poor Village, where his friends that did accompany him, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him merrily if there were any contending for Offices in that Town, and whether there were any strife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Noble-men for honour? <hi>Caesar</hi> answered, <hi>I cannot tell: but for my part, I had rather be the chiefest man</hi>
               <note place="margin">His ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
               <hi>here, than the second person in Rome.</hi> Another time in <hi>Spain</hi> reading the History of <hi>Alexander</hi> he was sorrowfull a good while after, and at last burst out into weeping. His Friends marvelling at it, asked him what was the cause of his sorrow? He answered, <hi>Do you not think that I have good cause to be sorry, when</hi> Alexander (<hi>being no older than myself) had conquered so many Nations and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, whereas hitherto I have done nothing worthy of my self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he first came into <hi>Spain</hi> he followed his business close, and in a short time had joined ten new Ensigns<note place="margin">His victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </note> of Foot Souldiers, unto the other twenty which he had before. Then marching against the <hi>Gallicians,</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitanians,</hi> he conquered all before him as far as to the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantick</hi> Ocean, subduing those People which before knew not the <hi>Romans</hi> for their Lords; and then did as wisely take order for the establishing of Peace. For he reconciled the Cities together, made them Friends: But especially he pacified all suits of Law betwixt

            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> had a custome, that such as desired the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Triumph, should stay without the City, whereas they that sued for the Consulship must of necessity be there in Person. <hi>Caesar</hi> coming home just at that time when Consuls were to be chosen, he sent to request the Senate that he might be permitted to sue for the Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship by his friends: Against this <hi>Cato</hi> at first did vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently invey, alleadging that it was contrary to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Law. But when he perceived that many of the Senators (being <hi>Caesar</hi>'s friends) favoured his request, he cunningly sought all he could to prevent them: whereupon <hi>Caesar</hi> resolved rather to give over his suit, for the Triumph, than to lose the Consulship: So he came into the City, and outwitted all but <hi>Cato.</hi> His device was this, <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus</hi> were the two greatest<note place="margin">His subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> Persons in <hi>Rome,</hi> and at jarr between themselves: <hi>Caesar</hi> affecting to make himself greater than either of them, sought to make them friends, and thereby to get the power of them both: For indeed, they both affected his Friendship, that by his help they might supplant one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And in the end, by his endeavours, a peace was concluded betwixt them: yet being still jealous one of another, and fearing to lose <hi>Caesar,</hi> they both sought to gratifie him, and by this means he made himself equall to either of them: and that power which they two had formerly usurped, was now divided between three, and in the end <hi>Caesar</hi> hereby got the sole command.</p>
            <p>This League being made betwixt them, <hi>Caesar</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Consulship, being brought into the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly for the Election betwixt these two Noble Persons

               <hi>Bibulus,</hi> without the contradiction of any: And when he was entered into his Office, he began to put forth Laws meeter for a sedicious Tribune than for a Consul, because by them he preferred the division of Lands, and distrubuting Corne to every Citizen <hi>Gratis,</hi> and all to please the People; And when the Senators op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed it, he took the advantage, Protesting that the Senate by their austerity drave him against his will to cleave to the People, and thereupon he asked <hi>Crassus</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> in the open Assembly, if they gave their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to his Laws? They answered, yea. Then he prayed them to stand by him against those that threatned to oppose him with the Sword: <hi>Crassus</hi> said he would, and <hi>Pompey</hi> did the like, adding, that he would come with his Sword and Target both against such; which gave great offence to the Senate, but the common People much rejoyced.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> to oblige <hi>Pompey</hi> more to him, gave him his Daughter <hi>Julia</hi> in marriage, who was made sure before<note place="margin">He mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries his Daughter to <hi>Pompey</hi>

And <hi>Bibulus</hi> perceiving that he did but contend in vaine, <hi>Caesar</hi> being too potent for him, and that his Life was in danger for opposing these Laws, he kept his House all the rest of his Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> having married <hi>Julia,</hi> he filled the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place with Souldiers, and by open force authorised the Lawes which <hi>Caesar</hi> had made in favour of the People: He procured also that <hi>Caesar</hi> had both the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56425:6"/>
all <hi>Illyria,</hi> with four Legions, granted him for five years: and when <hi>Cato</hi> stood up to speak against it, <hi>Caesar</hi>

               </note> bad his Officers to lay hold on him, and carry him to Prison, thinking that he would have appealed to the Tribunes, but <hi>Cato</hi> said no more, but went his way. And <hi>Caesar</hi> seeing that not only the Nobility, but the Commons also were offended at it, out of respect to <hi>Cato</hi>'s virtues, he secretly prayed one of the Tribunes that he would take <hi>Cato</hi> from his Officers, which was done accordingly. Many of the Senators refused to be present in the Senate under him, but left the City, because they could not endure his doings; whereupon one <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> an old man told him, that the Senators durst not meet because of his Souldiers. Why then (said <hi>Caesar</hi>) dost not thou also keep home out of the same fear?

            <p>

               <hi>Cicero,</hi> who had discovered his Villanies, and <hi>Caesar</hi> would not go to his Province till he had set them two together by the ears, and driven <hi>Cicero</hi> out of <hi>Italy.</hi> Yet did he deserve the name of as brave a Generall as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that went before him, if we consider the hard Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where he made Wars: His gaining of so many Countries which he adjoyned to the Empire of <hi>Rome:</hi> The multitude and power of the enemies whom he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame: The rudenesse and Valour of the men with whom he had to doe, whose manners yet he mollified, and civilized: His courtesy, and clemency to those whom he overcame: His great bounty and liberallity to those that served under him: As also if we consider the number of Battels that he fought, and the multitude of enemies that were slaine by him. For in lesse then ten years, he took by assault above eight hundered<note place="margin">His Va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lour and great suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses.</note> Townes: He conquered three hundred Nations: and having at several times above thirty hundred thousand
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56425:7"/>
Souldiers against him, he slew a Million of them, and took as many more Prisoners. He was so intirely beloved of his Souldiers, that to doe him service, and<note place="margin">His Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</note> to advance his honour, they were invincible: As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the example of <hi>Acilius,</hi> who in a Sea-fight before the City of <hi>Marseiles,</hi> boarding one of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Ships, had his right hand cut off, and yet he ran upon his enemies, thrusting them in their faces with his Target on his left hand, and so prevailed that he took their Ship.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Cassius Scava</hi> also in a fight before the City of <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> having an eye put out with an Arrow, his shoulder striken through with a Dart, and his thigh with another, having received thirty Arrows upon his Shield, called to his enemies as if he would yeild to them: but when two of them came running to him, he cut off one of their armes by the shoulder, and wounded the other in the face, and made them give back till he was fetched off by some of his fellowes. In <hi>Brittan</hi> also when some of his Captaines were driven into a bog full of mire and dirt, the enemies fiercely assaulting them there, <hi>Caesar</hi> viewing the Battel, he saw a private Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier thrust in amongst the Captaines, where he fought so valiantly that at length he forced the Barbarous Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to fly, and thereby saved the Captaines, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise had perished there: And then this Souldier being the hindmost of all the Captaines, marched through the bog, sometimes swiming, and sometimes on foot, till he gat to the farther side, onely he lost his Target. <hi>Caesar</hi> wondring at his valour, ran and imbraced him: But the poor Souldier, hanging down his head, with teares in his eyes, fell at <hi>Caesars</hi> feet, begging pardon for leaving his Target behind him. In <hi>Africk</hi> also, <hi>Scipio</hi> having taken one of <hi>Caesars</hi> Ships, slew all that were in it, save <hi>Petronius,</hi> a Treasurer, to whome he profered life: But <hi>Petronius</hi> answered him, that <hi>Caesars</hi> Souldiers used to give others their lives, and not to have their lives given them, and thereupon slew himself with his own Sword.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:56425:7"/>Now <hi>Caesar</hi> bred this courage in them by reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them bountifully, and honouring them. He also gave them a good example by adventuring himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on manifest dangers, and putting his Body to extreame paines when there was occasion, which filled them with admiration. As for his costitution he was lean, white, and soft skin'd, and often troubled with the Head-ach, and sometimes with the falling sicknesse, yet yeilded he not to his sicknesse, but rather took paines as a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine<note place="margin">His Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.</note> to cure it, travelling continually, living soberly and commonly lying abroad in the Fields. Most nights he slept in his Coach, and in the dayes travelled up and down to see Cities, Castles, and strong holds. He had alwayes a Secretary with him in his Coach, who writ as they went by the way, and a Souldier behind him that carryed his Sword. He made such speed when he had gotten his Office at <hi>Rome,</hi> that in eight dayes he came to the River of <hi>Rhone.</hi> He was an excellent Rider from his youth: for holding his hands behind him, he would<note place="margin">His activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> run his Horse upon the spurre.</p>
            <p>In his Wars in <hi>Gaul,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> he used to exercise himself in inditing Letters by the way, wherein he was so nimble that he imployed two Secretaries, or more at one time. He made very little account of his Diet, Supping one night in <hi>Millane</hi> with his Friend <hi>Valerius Leo,</hi> there was served at Table some <hi>Sperage</hi> with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed oile instead of Sallet oile, he eat it, and found no fault, blaming his Friends who were offended at the mistake, saying, that if they liked it not they should have let it alone, and that it was not good manners hereby to shame their Friend. At another time in his journey he was forced by soul weather to shelter himself in a poor Cottage that had but one Cabbin, and that so narrow that one could scant lye in it, whereupon he said to his Friends, the greatest roomes, are fittest for the greatest men, and Beds for sick persons, and so caused <hi>Oppius</hi> that was sick to lie there, and himself with the rest of his Friends, lay without doors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:56425:8"/>The first War that <hi>Caesar</hi> made in <hi>Gaul,</hi> was against<note place="margin">He over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the <hi>Swissers.</hi>
               </note> the <hi>Helvetians,</hi> or <hi>Swissers,</hi> and the <hi>Tygurines,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving set fire of their own Cities and Houses, came to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade that part of <hi>Gaul</hi> which was subject to the <hi>Romans.</hi> These were a very War-like and Valiant People, and in all they were three hundred thousand souls, whereof there were one hundred and ninety thousand fighting men: yet were they overthrown by <hi>Labienus, Caesar</hi>'s Lieutenant at the River <hi>Arax.</hi> And when the <hi>Helveti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> afterwards came suddenly to set upon <hi>Caesar,</hi> he made hast to get into some place of strength, and there ordered his Battel against them, and when one brought him his charging Horse, he said, <hi>when I have overcome mine enemies, then I will get upon him, to pursue them,</hi> and so marching against them on foot, he fiercely charged them: The Battel continued long before he could make them fly: yet had he more ado to take their Camp, and to break the strength that they had made with their Carts. For not onely those that were fled into it, made head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but their Wives and Children also fought stoutly for their lives, till they were all slain, and the Battel was scarce ended by midnght.</p>
            <p>Presently after, above one hundred thousand of those that had escaped from this Battel, were forced by <hi>Caesar</hi> to return into their own Country again, and to the Townes which they had burnt; and this he did lest the <hi>Germans</hi> should come over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and settle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in that Country being void.</p>
            <p>The next War that <hi>Caesar</hi> made was in defence of the<note place="margin">And the <hi>Germans.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Gauls</hi> against the <hi>Germans,</hi> though himself had before admitted <hi>Ariovistus</hi> their King to be received as a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate of the <hi>Romans:</hi> Notwithstanding which, they were grown very unquiet Neighbours, watching but an opportunity to possess themselves of the rest of <hi>Gaul. Caesar</hi> perceiving that some of his Captains much feared them, especially the young Gentlemen of Noble Fame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, who went along with him as to some Pastimes, he commanded all that were afraid to return home, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56425:8"/>
not endanger themselves against their wills. But for himself he said, he would set upon those Barbarous Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though he had left him but the tenth Legion onely. Upon this the tenth Legion sent their Officers to thank him for the good opinion he had of them: and all the other Legions blamed their Captaines for their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness, and followed him cheerfully till they came within two hundred Furlongs of the enemies Camp.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ariovistus</hi> his courage was well cooled when he saw<note place="margin">And the <hi>Gauls.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Caesar</hi> so near, whereas they thought that the <hi>Romans</hi> were afraid of them: His Army also was in a great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze. But that which discouraged them most, was the Prophesies of some foolish women, who observing the terrible noise which the water in the River made, advised the <hi>Germans</hi> by no means to fight, and they being possessed with a supestitious fear, sought to avoid the fight: Yet <hi>Caesar</hi> skirmished with them every day and sometimes followed them to their Forts, and little Hills where they lay, whereby he so provoked them that at last they came down with great fury to fight. In this Battell he overcame them, and pursued them very eagerly, making a great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them even to the River of <hi>Rhine,</hi> filling all the fields with dead Bodies, and spoiles. <hi>Ariovistus</hi> himself flying speedily got over the River, and escaped with some few of his men: At this Battell there were slain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eighty thousand <hi>Germans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this Battel <hi>Caesar</hi> left his Army to winter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Sequanes,</hi> and himself thinking of the affairs<note place="margin">His poli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy.</note> of <hi>Rome,</hi> returned over the <hi>Alps</hi> to a place about the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Po:</hi> whilest he lay there he laboured to make Friends at <hi>Rome:</hi> and when many came to visit him there, he granted all their suits, and sent them back, some with liberal rewards, and others with large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, whereby he engaged them to him.</p>
            <p>During all the time of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s great conquests in <hi>Gaul, Pompey</hi> did not consider how <hi>Caesar</hi> conquered the <hi>Gauls</hi> with the <hi>Roman</hi> weapons, and wan the <hi>Romans</hi> with

               </note> of all the <hi>Gauls,</hi> were all up in Armes and had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a very great Power, he presently made towards them with all possible, speed; and found them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running and plundering the neighbour Countries and confederates of the <hi>Romans,</hi> wherefore he gave them Battel, and overthrew their chiefest Army, and slew so many of them that the Lakes and Rivers were died with their bloud, and filled with their dead Bodies, that the <hi>Romans</hi> passed over on foot upon them: After this overthrow, such of them as dwelt neere the Sea yeilded themselves: and from thence he conducted his Army against the <hi>Nervians,</hi> the stoutest Souldiers of all the <hi>Belgae.</hi> These dwelling in a Woody Country, had conveyed their Wives, Children and Goods into a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Forrest, remote from their enemies, and being above eighty thousand fighting men, they, watching their opportunity, set upon <hi>Caesar</hi> when his Army was out of order, and little expecting them. At the first charge they brake the <hi>Roman</hi> Horsemen, and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing the seventh and twelfth Legions, they slew all the Captains, and had not <hi>Caesar</hi> himself with his Shield on his Arme, run amongst them, making a lane as he went, and the tenth Legion, seeing him in that danger, followed him with all speed, there had not a <hi>Roman</hi> escaped alive that day. But looking upon <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s valour, his men fought desperately, even beyond their abilities, and yet could they not make the <hi>Nervi</hi> fly but they fought it out bravely till most of them were<note place="margin">A Battel.</note> slaine in the Field, five hundred onely of them ascape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Yet was it a bloudy Battel to the <hi>Romans,</hi> for that of four hundred Gentlemen, and Counsellers of <hi>Rome,</hi> there were but three saved.</p>
            <p>The Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> made great, signes of joy for these Victories, by sacrifizing to the Gods, Playes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and as <hi>Caesars</hi> fame was encreased hereby, so he wan upon the Peoples love: And alwayes, when his affaires would
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56425:9"/>
permit, he used to Winter by the River <hi>Po,</hi> to give direction about his affaires at <hi>Rome.</hi> And truly not only such as sued for Offices at <hi>Rome,</hi> obtained them by <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi> money, and therefore imployed all their power to promote his interest, but the chiefest also of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, went to <hi>Luke</hi> unto him, insomuch as at one time<note place="margin">His Poli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy.</note> there have been seen before his Gates, one hundred and twenty Sergeants carrying Rods and Axes before the Magistrates that have waited upon him, and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Senators besides. Here they held a Councell, wherein it was agreed, that <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus</hi> should again be chosen Consuls for the year following: and that <hi>Caesar</hi> should have more money delivered him to pay his Army, and that his Government should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued for five years longer.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Caesar</hi> returning into <hi>Gaul</hi> to his Army, found there a great War begun: For two Potent Nations of the <hi>Germans,</hi> having passed over the River of <hi>Rhine</hi> to conquer new lands, <hi>Caesar</hi> fought with them, which himself thus discribeth: These Barbarous People (saith he) after they had sent Ambassadours to me to desire peace, contrary to the Law of Armes, came and set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me as I travelled by the way, insomuch as eight hundred of their men overthrew five thousand of my Horsemen, who nothing at all expected their comming, And going on to describe their farther proceedings. he saith, that they again sent Ambassadours to him to mock him, whom he kept Prisoners, and then setting upon the enemies, who were about four hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Persons, he slew most of them, saving a few that<note place="margin">He over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the <hi>Germans.</hi>
               </note> flying gat back over the River of <hi>Rhine</hi> and so escaped. <hi>Caesar,</hi> taking this occasion, and being ambitious to have the honour of being the first <hi>Roman</hi> that ever pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed this River with an Army, he built a Bridg over it, though the River were very broad, and ran with a violent streame, and especially there where he built the Bridge: and the Barbarians casting great Trees into the River, they were carried down with such violence
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56425:10"/>
that by their great blowes they did sore shake the Posts of the Bridge, to prevent which, and to abate the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the streame, <hi>Caesar</hi> caused a Pile to be made a good way above the Bridge, which was forcibly rammed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottom of the River, so that in ten dayes space he had finished his Bridge of goodly Carpenters work: A very rare invention as could be possibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised.</p>
            <p>Then passing his Army over this Bridge, he found none that durst fight with him: For the <hi>Suevians</hi> who were<note place="margin">He passes over the <hi>Rhine.</hi>
               </note> the most Warlike People of the <hi>Germans,</hi> had retired themselves and goods into great Valleys, Bogs, Woods, and Forrests. <hi>Caesar</hi> therefore having burnt up the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Country, and confirmed the League with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sederates of the <hi>Romans,</hi> he returned back into <hi>Gaul.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time also he made a journey into <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the first that sailed the Westerne Ocean with an Army, and that passed through the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea to<note place="margin">And went into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note> make War in this great and famous Island, and was the first that enlarged the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire beyond the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Earth. For he twice passed the Seas out of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> where he fought many Battels with the <hi>Brittans,</hi> in which he did more hurt to the enemies, than enrich his own men: therefore this War had not such successe as he expected, which made him one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take pledges of the King and to impose a year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tribute upon him, and so returned back into <hi>Gaul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was no sooner landed there, but he met with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which advertised from <hi>Rome</hi> of the death of his<note place="margin">

During which time all <hi>Gaul</hi> rebelled again, and had raised great Armies, who were led by one <hi>Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orix.</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:56425:10"/>
These did first set upon the Garrisons of <hi>Caetta,</hi> and <hi>Titurius,</hi> whom they slew together with all their men. Then they went with sixty thousand men, and besieged the Garrison which <hi>Quintus Cicero</hi> had in charge, and had almost taken it by storme, <hi>Ciceroes</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers being all wounded, yet they shewed such valour that they did more than men in their own defence. This newes comming to <hi>Caesar,</hi> who was far off, he returned with all possible speed, and levying seven thousand Souldiers, he hasted to relieve <hi>Cicero</hi> that was in great distresse. The <hi>Gauls</hi> that besieged him, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Caesars</hi> comming, arose, and went to meet him, making little account of his small number: <hi>Caesar</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap them, still drew back, making as though he fled from them, but still lodging in plaees of safety, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his men that they should not stirre out to skirmish with them, but rather to raise the ramparts of his Camp, and to fortifie the Gates, as men affraid, that their enemies might the lesse esteeme them: But at length, he took the opportunity when the enemies came in a disordered manner to assault his Camp, and<note place="margin">He beates the <hi>French.</hi>
               </note> then sallying out, he routed, and slew a great number of them.</p>
            <p>This Act suppressed all the rebellions of the <hi>Gauls</hi> in those parts: Himself also went in the midst of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in those places where they did Rebel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for now he had a new supply out of <hi>Italy</hi> of three whole Legions to fill up the rooms of those that were slaine, of which <hi>Pompey</hi> lent him two, and the other Legion was raised about the River <hi>Po.</hi> Shortly after there brake out the greatest and most dangerous War that ever he had in <hi>Gaul,</hi> which had been long designed by the chiefest and most Warlike People in all that Country, who had a very great Army, leavying multitudes of men, and much Treasure to fortifie their strong holds: The Country where thy were was very hard to come into, especially then in the Winter when the Rivers were high, and the Woods and Forrests covered with Snow,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56425:11"/>
the meddowes drowned with floods, and the Snow so deep that no wayes could be discerned, all which might have discouraged <hi>Caesar</hi> from setting upon them: the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because many Nations joyned in this conspiracy, of whom the chief were the <hi>Vernians,</hi> and the <hi>Carnutes,</hi> who had chosed <hi>Vercing entorix</hi> for their Captain. He divided his Army into divers places, under divers Captaines, and drawn into his assistance all the Nations as far as to the <hi>Adriatiek</hi> Sea: So that if he had tarried a little longer till <hi>Caesar</hi> had been ingaged in his Wars with <hi>Pompey,</hi> he had put all <hi>Italy</hi> into great fear and danger.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Caesar,</hi> who knew his advantages, and how to take the best opportunities, as soon as he heard of this Rebellion, he hasted towards them, intending to let<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell.</note> them know, that they had to do with an Army that was invincible, and which they could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly withstand, seeing they had marched with such speed in so hard a Winter. This made them wonder when they saw him burning and destroying their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, when they thought him far off. Such Towns and strong Forts as yeilded to him, he received to mercy. But the <hi>Hedui,</hi> who used to be stiled the Brethren of the <hi>Romans,</hi> taking Armes against him, much discouraged his men: wherefore <hi>Caesar</hi> went through the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the <hi>Lingones</hi> to enter into <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates with the <hi>Romans.</hi> Thither the enemies fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, endeavouring to compasse him in on every side. <hi>Caesar</hi> tarried their comming, and then fighting with them a long time, he at last overcame them. Of<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes them.</note> those which fled, most of them together with their King got into the City of <hi>Alexia,</hi> which <hi>Caesar</hi> presently besieged, though it seemed inexpugnable, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the hight of the Walls, and the many hands to defend them. During this siege <hi>Caesar</hi> fell into a very great danger: For three hundred thousand of the best Souldiers amongst the <hi>Gauls</hi> came against him, besides those within the City, who were seventy thousand fighting men, so that finding himself to be shut in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56425:11"/>
two such mighty Armies, he was faign to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie himself with two Walls: One against those with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Alexia,</hi> and the other against those without. And truly the Battell which he wan at this place, gat him more honour than any other that ever he fought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For in this extream danger he shewed more Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Wisdom, and courage than in any other. And this was wondefull, that they within the City ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of their Friends that came to assist them, till <hi>Caesar</hi> had overcome them: Yea, <hi>Caesars</hi> own men that guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Wall against the City, knew nothing of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell till they heard the cries and lamentations of those in the City, when they saw the <hi>Romans</hi> bring into their Camp such a number of Shields glistering with Gold and Silver, such store of bloudy Corslets, and Armour, such a deal of Plate, and movables, and such a number of Tents, and Pavilions of the <hi>Gauls</hi> which the <hi>Romans</hi> had gotten of their spoiles. Thus the greatest part of this huge Army were slain: and as for those within the City, when they had done and received much hurt, they at last, yeilded, and <hi>Vercing entorix,</hi> went out of the City rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Armed, and his Horse furnished with brave, and glittering Caparisons, and rode about, <hi>Caesar</hi> who sat in his Chair of State. Then allighting, he took off the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons, and stript himself of his Armour, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated himself on the Ground, and then went and sat down at <hi>Caesars</hi> feet, speaking never a word. <hi>Caesar</hi> after a while committed him to Prison to be led in his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Caesar</hi> had long since projected the distruction of<note place="margin">

               <hi>Pompey,</hi> as <hi>Pompey</hi> had done the like for him. Nothing kept <hi>Caesar</hi> from being the Greatest Person but <hi>Pompey</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> and nothing kept <hi>Pompey</hi> from being supreame but <hi>Caesar.</hi> Hitherto <hi>Pompey</hi> had set light by <hi>Caesar,</hi> thinking that he could crush him when he pleased: But <hi>Caesar</hi> went more cunningly to work: for to attaine his end, he procured to be sent into <hi>Gaul,</hi> where he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised and hardened his Army, and by his valiant deeds
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56425:12"/>
purchased fame and honour: so that now he lacked no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an occasion to put his design in practise, which <hi>Pompey</hi> partly gave him, and the iniquity of the times much surthered it. For such as sued for honours and Offices, bought the voices of the People shamefully, who therefore came to the Market-place, not to give their voices, but with Bowes, and Slings, and Swords: and the Assembly seldom brake up, but the Pulpit for Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was besprinkled with the bloud of the slaine, so that many Wise men believed, that there was no<note place="margin">Disorders at <hi>Rome.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cato</hi> smelling his drift, perswaded the Senate rather to make him sole Consul, thereby to satisfy his ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> sole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul.</note> This was done accordingly, and the time also for the Gevernment of his Provinces was prorogued: they allowed him also a thousand Talents yearly out of the publick Treasury wherewith to pay his Souldiers. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Caesar</hi> took occasion to send his men to <hi>Rome,</hi> to sue in his name for the Consulship, and for the prolonging of his Government. This was too indiscreetly opposed by <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> and <hi>Lentulu,</hi> and many things were spoken in his disgrace. They took away also the freedom from the Collonies which <hi>Caesar</hi> had lately granted them. And when <hi>Marcellus</hi> was Consul, he caused one of those Senators to be whipt, saying, that he gave him those marks, that he might be known to be no Citizen of <hi>Rome;</hi> and bad him go and tell <hi>Caesar</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Shortly after <hi>Caesar</hi> opened his Treasures which he had got in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and gave it freely among the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates of <hi>Rome.</hi> He set <hi>Curio</hi> the Tribune, cleer out of debt: He gave to the Consul <hi>Paul</hi> fifteen hundred Talents, wherewith he built a stately Theater. <hi>Pompey</hi> now beginning to fear, laboured to have a successour

This made <hi>Pompey</hi>

                  <hi>Pompey</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded.</note> more secure, that he neglected to prepare for War. One of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Captaines coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> and moving the Senate to have his government prorogued, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying their answer, he laid his hand upon his Sword, and said, <hi>Sith you will not grant it him, this shall give it him. Caesar</hi> seemed to be very reasonable in what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested, For he said, that whilest they required him to lay down Armes for fear of a Tyranny, and yet permitted <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> to keep his, they went about to establish a Tyranny.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Curio</hi> in the name of <hi>Caesar</hi> moved before all the People, that both should be commanded to lay down Armes, which motion was entertained with great joy and clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of hands by the People, who threw nose-gayes, and flowers upon him for it. Then <hi>Anthony</hi> one of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes,<note place="margin">Factions in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> brought a letter from <hi>Caesar,</hi> and read it before the People in spite of the Consuls, wherein hae desired that they would grant him <hi>Gaul</hi> on this side the <hi>Alps,</hi> and <hi>Illyria</hi> with two Legions onely, and then he would desire no more: But <hi>Scipio</hi> the Father in Law of <hi>Pompey,</hi> moved in the Senate, that if <hi>Caesar</hi> did not dismiss his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by a day appointed, that then he should be proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an enemy to <hi>Rome, Marccilus</hi> also added, that they must use force of Armes and not Arguments against a Thief; whereupon the Senate rose without determining any thing, and every one put on his mourning ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell as in the time of a common calamity. <hi>Cirero</hi> being newly come from his Government in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> took much pains to reconcile them together, and perswaded <hi>Pompey</hi> all he could, who told him that he would yield to whatsoever he desired, so he would let him alone with his Army: But <hi>Lentulus</hi> the Consul shamefully drave <hi>Curio</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> out of the Senate, who were in such

danger that they were faigne to fly out of <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Caesar,</hi> disguised in a Carriers coat. This gave <hi>Caesar</hi> great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and much incensed his men, when they saw and heard how his Friends were abused.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> at this time had about him but five thousand<note place="margin">

               </note> Foot, and three thousand Horse, having left the rest of his Army on the other side of the <hi>Alps,</hi> to be brought after him by his Lieutenants: Judging it better suddenly to steal upon them at <hi>Rome,</hi> then to assail them with his whole Army, which would require time, &amp; give his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies opportunity to strengthen themselves against him. He therefore commanded his Captains to go before, and to take in the City of <hi>Ariminum</hi> (a great City on this side the <hi>Alps</hi>) with as little bloodshed as might be. Then committing the rest of those Souldiers which he had with him, to <hi>Hortensius,</hi> he spent a whole day in seeing the sword players exercise before him. At night he went unto his lodging, where having bathed himself a little, he came into the Hall, and made merry with those whom he had bidden to supper. Then rising from the Table, he prayed his Guests to be merry, and he would come again to them presently: howbeit he had secretly before directed his most trusty Friends to follow him: not all together, but some one way, &amp; some another. Himself in the mean time took a Coach that he had hired, and pretending at first to go another way, he suddenly turned towards <hi>Ariminum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when he came to the River of <hi>Rubicorn,</hi> which divides the hither <hi>Gaul</hi> from <hi>Italy,</hi> he suddenly made a stop (for if he once passed that, there could be no hope of peace) considering with himself of what importance this passage was, and what miseries would ensue upon it. Some say that he spake thus to his Friends: <hi>Doubtlesse if I forbear to pass over this River, it will be the beginning of my ruine; if I passe it, the ruine will be generall:</hi> Then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the River, he said, <hi>It is yet in our power to turn back, but if we passe the River we must make our way with our Weapons.</hi> Some say, that <hi>Coesar</hi> standing thus
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56425:13"/>
doubtfull, he was encouraged by the apparition of a man of a very great stature, piping upon a reed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon many of the Souldiers and some Trumpetters went neer to hear him, and that he catching one of their Trumpets, leaped into the River, sounding to the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel with a mighty blast, and so passed on to the farther side of the River: Whereupon <hi>Caesar,</hi> with a furious resolution, cryed out, <hi>Let us go (whether the Gods,) and the injurious dealing of our enemies, do call us. The Dice are cast. I have set up my Rest, Come what will of it:</hi> After<note place="margin">He passes <hi>Rubicon.</hi>
               </note> which he set spurs to his Horse, and passed the River his Army following him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> having passed the River and drawn his Army together, he made an Oration to them, shedding some tears, and tearing his Garment down the Breast, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before them the equity of his cause, and craying their assistance. To whom, having with a generall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause and consent made answer; that they were ready to obey his will, he presently marched on and came the next day to <hi>Ariminum,</hi> upon which he seized. The like he did to all the Towns and Castles as he passed on, till he came to <hi>Corfinium</hi> which was held by <hi>Domitius,</hi> who in a factious tumult had been nominated for his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour in the Government of <hi>Gaul.</hi> This being taken, he pardoned the Souldiers, and Inhabitants, and used <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitius</hi> kindly, giving him leave to depart (who went straight to <hi>Pompey</hi>) by which clemency he purchased to himself much honour. These thirty Cohorts he kept with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesars</hi> resolution being known at <hi>Rome,</hi> it troubled <hi>Pompey,</hi> amazed the Senate, and terrified the common People. <hi>Pompey</hi> now found himself deceived, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not believe that <hi>Caesar</hi> would thrust himself into so great danger, or that he could be able to raise sufficient forces to resist him: but the success proved o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. For though <hi>Pompey</hi> had authority from the Consuls and Senate to leavy Souldiers, to call home his Legions, and to send Captains for the defence of those

Cities in <hi>Italy</hi> by which <hi>Caesar</hi> should passe, yet all this was not sufficient to resist his fury, and the power that he brought with him. The fame of <hi>Caesars</hi> comming increasing daily, <hi>Pompey,</hi> with the whole Senate<note place="margin">

Thus <hi>Caesar</hi> injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Italy</hi> without opposition, yet was he doubtfull what to resolve on: He would gladly have followed <hi>Pompey</hi> but wanted Shipping, and it being Winter, he knew that Ships could not be procured so soon as was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site: and considering with all, that it was not safe to leave an enemy behind him, which might cause an alteration in <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Italy;</hi> he resolved first to go into <hi>Spain,</hi> which held for <hi>Pompey,</hi> and where he had his best Legions under the command of <hi>Petreius</hi> and <hi>Afranius,</hi> saying to his Friends, <hi>Let us go against an Army which wants a Captain, and afterwards we will go against a Captain that wants an Army.</hi> For <hi>Pompeys</hi> Souldiers in <hi>Spain</hi> were very valiant, and had been long exercised in Armes, but their Commanders were neither Politick, nor expert in War.

            <p>Then was he desirous to go into <hi>Spain,</hi> first taking order for the Civill Government: and making choise of the Legions which should go with him, he left the rest in <hi>Brundusium,</hi> and <hi>Otranto,</hi> and other strong places upon the Sea Coast, to keep <hi>Pompey</hi> from landing if he should attempt to return into <hi>Italy.</hi> He also made <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensius,</hi> and <hi>Dolabella</hi> his Captaines to provide Shipping to be brought into the Port of <hi>Brundusium,</hi> there to be in a readinesse against his return from <hi>Spain: Quintus Valerius</hi> he sent with a Legion into <hi>Sardinia</hi> against <hi>Marcus Cotta</hi> which held the same for <hi>Pompey.</hi> To <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi> he sent <hi>Curius,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Cate,</hi> with direction that having taken the same, he should passe over into <hi>Africk.

some while, chiefly about the City of <hi>Lerida.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At first <hi>Caesar</hi> was in great danger and much distressed chiefly for wans of Victuals, as also for that the Winter was come on, which troubled him with the swelling of Rivers, before and after which, there passed many<note place="margin">And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Pompeys</hi> men.</note> great skirmishes between the two Armies.

            </p>
            <p>This War being ended, and the Spring come, <hi>Caesar,</hi> that he might leave no enemy behind him, marched into the Province of <hi>Betica</hi> (now <hi>Andaluzia</hi>) with part of his forces, commanding the rest to march<note place="margin">And other places.</note> whither he had appointed, and there to stay for him, because <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> held that Province for <hi>Pompey</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Caesar</hi> with one good Legion: But he, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to oppose <hi>Caesar,</hi> delivered up the Legion to him, together with that Country, and all was pacified there.

            <p>It being now the depth of Winter, <hi>Pompey</hi> presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it improbable, if not impossible for <hi>Caesar</hi> to passe the Seas to him; having also intelligence that <hi>Caesar</hi> was in <hi>Rome,</hi> he disposed of his Army to their Winter Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Thessaly;</hi> and himself retired far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Sea, commanding his Sea-Captaines (of whom <hi>Marcus Bibulus</hi> was chiefe) to guard the Sea coast.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> hearing of <hi>Caesars</hi> arrivall, sent for his Troops which were neerest hand with all speed possible, with

whom he marched towards <hi>Dirrachium,</hi> where his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, ammunition, and other provisions for the War lay, lest <hi>Caesar</hi> should go and surprise them, which indeed he attempted but in vaine, the situation of the place make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it inexpugnable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> being come, their Camps were lodged within<note place="margin">Sksrmish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them.</note> a few furlongs each of other, where he passed many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous skirmishes, and also some Treaties of Peace, offered by <hi>Caesar,</hi> but rejected by <hi>Pompey,</hi> so confident he was of his own power. In the interim <hi>Caesar</hi> dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the comming of the other Legions, who staying longer than he expected, he resolved in person, with three Confident servants, secretly to embarke himself in a Brigandine, and to passe that streight of the Sea and to fetch them, hoping to performe the same with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of any. And accordingly, passing down the River to the Sea, he found it so troublesome and tempestious that the Master of his Brigandine (not knowing whom he carried) durst not adventure forth, but would have returned. Then <hi>Caesar</hi> discovering his face, said, <hi>Perge audactèr:</hi> Caesarem <hi>enim fers, &amp; fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> rashness.</note> Caesaris: Beare up bravely, and boldly against the Winds and Waves: for thou carriest <hi>Caesar,</hi> and all his Fortunes. The Master herewith encouraged, strove all that possibly he could to proceed in his voyage: but the force of the Tempest was so great, and the Wind so contrary, that do what possibly they could, they were driven back again.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Caesars</hi> Army heard of these passages, they much wondred, grieved and were troubled at it: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending him more for his Valour, than for his Wife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: But within few days after <hi>M.

Frequent skirmishes still continued between the two Armies, and many were slain on both sides, and one day the skirmish
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56425:17"/>
was so hot, supplies being sent from both sides, that it almost came to a just Battel, wherein <hi>Caesars</hi> men were<note place="margin">

Whereupon <hi>Caesar</hi> said to his Friends: <hi>Truly this day had ended the War, if our enemies had had a Captain that had known how to overcome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time <hi>Caesar</hi> lost a great number of his men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom were four hundred <hi>Roman</hi> Knights, ten Tribunes (or Collonels) and thirty two Centurions (or Captaines) and his enemies took for from him thirty two Ensignes. Upon this Victory <hi>Pompey</hi> sent newes thereof to diverse parts of the World, holding himself for an absolute Conquerour. <hi>Caesar</hi> much blamed some of his Captaines and Ensigne bearers for their cowardize, and his Army were so grieved and ashamed, that they much importuned him to lead them forth again to Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell: But he thought it not fit so soon to lead them forth against a Victorious Army.

               <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he understood that <hi>Pompey</hi> presuming upon the many benefits, and good entertainment which the Father of this King <hi>Ptolomy</hi> had received in his House, had sent to this <hi>Ptolomy</hi> to harbour and assist him: which accordingly the King promised, &amp; <hi>Pompey</hi> comming upon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56425:18"/>
his safe conduct, in a small Boat, was by the false Kings commandement basely murthered, thinking thereby to win the favour of <hi>Caesar.</hi> He understood likewise that <hi>Cornelia</hi> the Wife of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and his Son <hi>Sextus Pompey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> were fled from thence in the same ship wherein they came.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> being landed, and received into the City, they brought him for a present the Head of the <hi>Great Pompey;</hi> but he turned away and would not see it, and when they brought him <hi>Pompeys</hi> Ring with his Seal of Armes, he wept, considering the end and successe of the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures and properties of <hi>Pompey,</hi> who with such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour<note place="margin">Vanity of vanities.</note> and fame had Triumphed three times, and been so many times Consul in <hi>Rome:</hi> and had obtained so many Victories abroad.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Caesar</hi> was landed in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he found the Country imbroyled in Civill Wars: there being great discord between young King <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and his Sister <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi> about the division and Inheritance of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, wherein <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> (as being a <hi>Roman</hi> Consul) took upon him to be an Arbitrator. For which cause, or because their guilty consciences accused them for the treacherous murther of <hi>Pompey, Fotinus</hi> the Enuuch, who had contrived the said murther, and <hi>Achillas,</hi> who had been the actor of it, fearing that <hi>Caesar</hi> inclined to favour <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> sent for the Kings Army that lay neere the City, consisting of twenty thousand good Souldiers, purposing to do by <hi>Caesar</hi> as they had done by <hi>Pompey,</hi> so that within a few dayes, there began be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Caesar</hi> and his small Army, both in the City, and in the Harbour where the Ships and Galleys lay, the most cruel, and dangerous encounters that ever <hi>Caesar</hi> met with: For he was often forced to fight in his own Person, both within the City (whereof the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies<note place="margin">His Wars in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </note> held the Greater part) and also in the Harbour with his ships, and was sometimes in so great perill and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that he was forced to leap out of the Boat into the Water, and by swimming to get to one of the Gallies,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56425:18"/>
at which time he held his Commentaries in one hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Water, and carry his Robe in his teeth, and to<note place="margin">His dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> swimme with the other hand. But when his other Forces were come to him from <hi>Asia,</hi> and other parts, he at the end of nine moneths (for so long these Wars lasted) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Victorious, as in all other his enterprises he had been, and the young King <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was slaine in fight.<note place="margin">His Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> In this Warre <hi>Caesar</hi> did such exploits, and behaved himself so gallantly, that for the same onely he well deserved the fame and name of a brave Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>The Pride of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> being thus tamed, <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> put to death the murtherers of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and established the faire <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> the Queen and Governesse of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> whom, during his stay there, he intertained for his Friend, and had a Son by her called <hi>Caesarion.</hi> And when he had quitted and settled all things in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he departed thence into <hi>Asia,</hi> and travelled through <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
               <note place="margin">He passes into <hi>Asia.</hi>
               </note> (now <hi>Soria</hi>) being informed, that during his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> King <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> the Son of that mighty King <hi>Methridates,</hi> thought it a fit time, whilst the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were embroiled in Civil Wars, to recover what his Father had lost: For which end having overthrown <hi>Domitius,</hi> whom <hi>Caesar</hi> had sent to govern those parts, and having taken by force of Armes the Provinces of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynia,</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> expelling thence King <hi>Ariobar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanes</hi> (a Friend and Subject of <hi>Rome</hi>) and beginning to do the like in <hi>Armenia the lesse,</hi> which King <hi>Deiotarus</hi> had subjected to the <hi>Romans: Caesar</hi> (I say) being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed hereof, went with his Army sooner than <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces</hi> imagined, though he expected him, and had intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of his approach, so that in few dayes they came to a Battell, in which the King was soon overthrown,<note place="margin">Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>Pharnaces.</hi>
               </note> and put to flight, with great slaughter of his People, yet himself escaped.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> was very joyfull for this Victory, because his of earnest desire to returne to <hi>Rome;</hi> where he knew that many scandals were raised, and many insolencies were

committed for want of his presence: He knew also that <hi>Pompeys</hi> eldest Son had seized upon a great part of <hi>Spain,</hi> and had raised great forces of those which <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> had left there, and of his Fathers Troops. He also under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that in <hi>Africa</hi> many principal <hi>Romans,</hi> who had escaped from the Battell of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> were gethered together, where of <hi>M.

               <hi>Caesar</hi> having intelligence of all these things, within the space of a few dayes, with great celerity and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence recovered all that <hi>Pharnaces</hi> had usurped, and chasing him out of <hi>Portus</hi> he regained all those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: and so leaving <hi>Celius Minucius</hi> for General, with two Legions to gaurd that Province, pacifying the controversies and contentions in the rest, and reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings, and <hi>Tetrarchs</hi> which continued firme in their Leagues and amity with the <hi>Romans,</hi> without any longer aboad, he departed out of <hi>Asia,</hi> and in a short space arrived in <hi>Italy,</hi> and so passed to <hi>Rome,</hi> within little more than a year after he went thence, which<note place="margin">He comes to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> was a very short time for the performance of so great matters, and so long a journey.</p>
            <p>Presently after his comming to <hi>Rome,</hi> he caused himself to be chosen Consul the third time, and reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (so much as the time and his leasure would permit) all disorders in <hi>Rome,</hi> being troubled and not able to endure that his enemies should possesse <hi>Africk,</hi> with great expedition he prepared all things necessary, and from <hi>Rome</hi> took his way towards <hi>Africk,</hi> commanding

his Army to follow him. First he went into <hi>Italy,</hi> from from whence taking Ship, he passed over into <hi>Africk,</hi>

               </note> and though neither his Navy, nor his Army arrived with him, trusting to the valour of those that he had with him, and his own good Fortune, he landed with small Forces, neere to the City of <hi>Adrumentum,</hi> and from thence marched to an other City called <hi>Leptis,</hi> into which he was received, and after some conflicts that passed, his Legions being come to him, and certaine other Troops of Horse, and Companies of Foot, he began the War which continued four moneths.

            <p>In this War were many encounters and Battels, in which <hi>Caesar</hi> was in great danger: but at last (his good Fortune, still attending him) he overcame them in a great Battell, wherein there were slaine of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ten thousand, and <hi>Caesar</hi> remained Master of the<note place="margin">He over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>Scipio.</hi>

his end: For after he had embraced his Son, and his Friends and bad them good night, and then rested a while upon his bed, having first perused <hi>Plato</hi>'s Book of the immortality of the Soul: then about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of the first watch he got up, drew his sword, and therewith thrust himself through: after which the Phisicians applied plaisters to his wounds which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured whilst they were in the roome, but then he pulled them away, and the bloud following abundantly, he left his dying hand even in the wound. <hi>Scipio,</hi> who had been Generall in this War, escaped also from the Battell by flight, entered into some Gallies, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing met with by <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Navy, that he might not fall into his enemies hand, after he had given himself some wounds, he threw himself into the Sea, and so was drowned.</p>

               </note> twenty fifth day of <hi>July.</hi> At his comming thither there were granted unto him four Triumphs: First for his conquests and Victories in <hi>France,</hi> in which were<note place="margin">His Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs.</note> carried the Protractures of the Rivers of <hi>Rodanus,</hi> and the <hi>Rhine</hi> wraught in Gold. The second Triumph was for the Conquest of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and of King <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> where were set the River of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and the <hi>Pharus</hi> burning. The third was for the Conquest of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and of King <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> wherein, in regard of his speedy Victory, was placed a writing with these words, <hi>Veni, Vidi, Vici:</hi> I came, I saw, I overcame. The fourth Triumph was for the Province of <hi>Africa,</hi> wherein King <hi>Jubas</hi> Son was led Captive: and in this Triumph were given Jewels, and Armes to <hi>Octavius, Caesars</hi> Nephew, who succeeded him in the Empire. As for the Battell wherein he Conquered <hi>Pompey,</hi> he would
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56425:20"/>
not Triumph, because it was against a Citizen of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Triumphes being ended, he gave great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to his Souldiers, and intertained the People with Feasts, and bountifull gifts, and then caused himself to be chosen the fourth time, Consul. And so, to the end that there should be left no place wherein he would not be obeyed, he resolved to go for <hi>Spain,</hi> hearing that <hi>Gneius Pompeius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Pompey,</hi> was retired with the rest of the Army which had escaped out of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick,</hi> to go to his Brother <hi>Sextus Pompeius,</hi> who was in possession of a great part of <hi>Spain,</hi> as we heard before, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the famous Cities of <hi>Sivil,</hi> and <hi>Cordova,</hi> and many others of those parts: many <hi>Spaniards</hi> also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to their aid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> in this journey carryed with him his most vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and most experienced Souldiers, and made so good<note place="margin">He goes nto <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </note> speed, that in few dayes space he arrived in <hi>Spain,</hi> in which journey his Nephew <hi>Octavius</hi> followed him. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into <hi>Spain</hi> he came to the Province of <hi>Betica</hi> (now <hi>Andaluzia</hi>) where were <hi>Sextus Pompeius,</hi> with his Brother <hi>Gneius,</hi> and such Legions and Souldiers as they had gotten together; and there began betwixt <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> and them a most cruel and bloudy Warre, the end whereof was, that neere to the City of <hi>Munda, Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Gneius Pompeius</hi> (for <hi>Sextus</hi> was then<note place="margin">A cruel Battell.</note> at <hi>Cordova</hi>) joyned Battell, which was one of the most obstinate, and most cruel fights that ever was in the world. For <hi>Caesar</hi> being a most excellent Captain, and the Souldiers which he brought with him most brave and valiant men, and fleshed with so many Victories, held it out with great resolution; and on the other side, the bravery and courage of young <hi>Pompey</hi> and his men was such, and they fought in such manner, as <hi>Caesars</hi> Squadrons began to give ground, and were ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the Field, and at the very point to have been whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overthrown: and the matter came to this issue, that <hi>Caesar</hi> was about to have slain himself because he would
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56425:21"/>
not see himself overcome. Yet taking a Target from one of his Souldiers, he rushed into the midst of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, saying with a loud voice, <hi>If ye be not ashamed, leave me and deliver me into the hands of these Boyes; For this shall be the last day of my Life and of your Honour:</hi> with which words, and his example, his Souldiers took heart in such manner, that recovering the ground which they had lost, the Battell became equall, which lasted almost a whole day without any signe of Victory to either party, sometimes seeming to incline to the one, sometimes to the other side; untill at the length <hi>Caesar</hi> and his men did so great exploits, as that the evening being come, his enemies began to faint, and fly, and the Victory<note place="margin">His Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> was apparently <hi>Caesars.</hi> There died of the enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty thousand in this Battell, and <hi>Caesar</hi> lost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a thousand men of account besides common Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> esteemed so much of this Victory, and so glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the danger which he had ascaped, that ever after he used to say, <hi>That in all other Battels he had fought for honour and Victory, and onely that day he fought for his life.</hi> Young <hi>Pompey,</hi> after he had performed all the offices of a Prudent Generall and Valiant, Souldier, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to fly, and wandering through many places, was at last taken and slaine by some of <hi>Caesars</hi> Friends, who carried his head to <hi>Caesar.</hi> His other Brother <hi>Sextus Pompeius,</hi> fled from <hi>Cordova,</hi> and afterwards forsook <hi>Spain: Caesar</hi> recovered <hi>Sivil,</hi> and <hi>Cordova,</hi> and all the rest of the Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after which, ordering his affaires in <hi>Spain</hi> after his pleasure, he returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> and<note place="margin">He returns <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> Triumphed for these Victories, which was his fifth and last Triumph.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> now came to be the most mighty, the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted, and the most highly esteemed man in the World, having conquered and subdued the greatest<note place="margin">His pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> part thereof, in as little time, as it might seeme that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man might be able<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to travel through those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries by reasonable journeys. He then made himself
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56425:21"/>
perpetuall Dictator, and so without opposition, he fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the making of himself the Soveraigne Lord, and Monarch of the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> within lesse than five years after he first attempted the same. And this was the Originall and beginning of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. For <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> would not be called King (that Name being odious to the <hi>Romans</hi> above all things, ever since Kings were first driven from <hi>Rome</hi>) but contented himself to be called Perpetuall Dictator, and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, which Title was usually given to the <hi>Roman</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals upon their obtaining any signall Victory. But after <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> all his successors took that title, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying to be called Emperour, which hath evere since been held for the highest Title, and Dignity in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> having now attained to that absolute power which he had so ambitiously saught after, he shewed in all his Deportment much clemency, and Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,<note place="margin">His cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naminity.</note> honouring and rewarding his Friends, and easily forgiving, and very cheerfully pardoning all those that had been his Adversaries: Thus he pardoned <hi>Brutus, Cassius, Cicero, Marcellus,</hi> and many others: Yea, some of them he admitted to his company, and private familiarity, and to Offices and Dignities; and amongst the many virtues wherewith he was endued, his clemency and liberality were most glorious. But all this prevailed not with the <hi>Romans</hi> to quench their desires after the recoverie of their lost liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, neither to asswage the hatred and malice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived against him by his adversaries, as afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
            <p>And notwithstanding many were discontented, yet some for love, others for fear, and out of dissimulation,<note place="margin">Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten's arise.</note> both Senate and People, yea all in generall gave him Names, preheminences and Titles of Honour, such as never had been given to any other man before him, neither ought to have been accepted by him; and many were the more offended, because they knew that he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56425:22"/>
affected and desired them. They gave him the name of Emperour, Father, Restorer, and Preserver of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. They made him perpetuall Dictator, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul for ten years: and perpetuall Censor of their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. His Statue was erected and set up amongst the Kings of <hi>Rome:</hi> and a Chair, and Throne of Ivory was set up for him in the Temple, and in the Senate House, and an high Throne in the Theater, and in the place where<note place="margin">Base flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</note> the Senators did use to sit. His Pictures and Statues were set up in the Temples, and in all publick places. Some Titles they gave him, and he accepted of, which were pecular to the Gods. The moneth formerly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad <hi>Quintile,</hi> they called <hi>Julius</hi> after his name. They also built, and consecreated Temples to him, as they did to <hi>Jupiter</hi> and the other Gods, and gave him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Honours which they held proper for their Gods, and did him many other honours exceeding all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> enjoying such honour and power, so that he had no equall, no second in the World with whom he might contend, it seemed that he would contend with himself, and attempt something wherein he might excell himself: For he was not contented with all the Victories which he had obtained, neither to have fought fifty severall Battels, in all which he was Victorious, save in that one at <hi>Dirrachium</hi> against <hi>Pompey:</hi> neither to have slaine in the Wars and Battels which he fought a Million, ninety, and odd thousands of men, besides those which were slaine in the Civil Wars. But being of a<note place="margin">His great projects.</note> most haughty mind, he sought to do greater matters, if greater could be.</p>
            <p>For first he resolved to passe into the East, there to conquer and subdue the fierce Nations of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and to revenge the death of <hi>Marcus Crassus;</hi> and from thence to passe through <hi>Hyrcania,</hi> and other Countries till he should come to the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, and so through all the parts of <hi>Scythia, Asiatica;</hi> and passing the River <hi>Tanais,</hi> to returne through <hi>Scythia</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> and in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56425:22"/>
his retreat to come into <hi>Germany,</hi> and other Countries bordering thereupon, conquering and subjecting all to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. For which end, he presently caused to be levied in severall places ten thausand Horsemen, and sixteen Legious of chosen Footmen, and appointing the time wherein he intended to begin his journey, he commanded them to repaire to their Rendevouz. He sought also not onely to subdue all Nations, but to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and reforme even nature it self: For he purposed to have made an Island of <hi>Peloponesus</hi> (now called <hi>Morea</hi>) by cutting the neck of land between the <hi>Egaean,</hi> and the <hi>Jonian</hi> Seas. He purposed also to have altered the courses of the River <hi>Tiber,</hi> and <hi>Anian,</hi> and to have made there new channels, capable of bearing great Ships. He ordered the digging down and levelling many high Hils and Mountaines, in <hi>Italy,</hi> and to dry up, and dreine great Lakes and Marishes therein. He corrected the computation of the year, reforming it according to the course of the Sun, and brought it into that order wherein it now is. He did the like about the course of the Moon, and her conjunctions and oppositions to the Sun: and this was attributed to him for Tyranny by those that hated him.</p>
            <p>Many others things <hi>Caesar</hi> did, which were very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, in reforming the Laws, customes, and Offices. He reedified the ruined City of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> and sent thither Colonies, and <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens to Inhabit it: the like he did by <hi>Corinth.</hi> But all these works with his high conceits and undertakings, were prevented, by his unexpected, and immature Death, which within a few Dayes after ensued. A few men, and those unarmed bereft him of his Life, whom no former forces could resist. For five moneths only he lived as Soveraign Lord in Peace; when those in whom he reposed greatest trust conspired his Death.</p>
            <p>Some say that <hi>Caesars</hi> was counselled to have a Guard about him alwayes; to which he answered, that he would have none: for that he had rather die once,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56425:23"/>
then live continually in feare. They which conspired his death, were stirred up thereto, either out of hatred to his Person, or desire of Liberty, accounting him for a Tyrant: or out of suspition that he would have made himself a King, a thing in the highest degree hatefull to the <hi>Romans:</hi> and lastly because he begun to contemne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: For he used to say, that the Commonwealth was<note place="margin">His Pride.</note> but a voice and name without a Body, or Substance, and that <hi>Sylla</hi> was a Fool for resigning his perpetuall Dictatorship. All the whole Senate comming one Day to the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> where he was, he sat still, and rose not up as formerly he used to do. His Friends also and Favourites began to report, that in the Books of the <hi>Sybils</hi> (which in <hi>Rome</hi> were had in great Veneration) it was written, that the <hi>Parthians</hi> could never be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come but by a man that should have the Title of a King, and therefore he laboured that <hi>Caesar</hi> should take upon him that Title before his <hi>Parthian</hi> War; and though he seemed to be displeased at it, yet they suspected the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and their suspition was encreased, for that, whereas the Tribunes of the People had caused a man to be imprisoned who had set a Crown upon the Head of one of <hi>Caesars</hi> Statues, he was so encensed against the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes that did it, that he deposed them from their Office: And not long after, when <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> (who was his great fovourite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that year his fellow Consul) being at some publick Games, came to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and put a Crown<note place="margin">His dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.</note> upon his Head, though he threw it down, yet they all imagined that <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> would not have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to have done it without his good liking, and that he did it but to prove the People how they would like it; these and such like passages gave them occasion to desire and designe his Death.</p>
            <p>They were also further encouraged hereunto, for that in sundry publick places, certain writings were set up which did intice and animate them to conspire against him: as upon the Statue of <hi>Brutus,</hi> who in ancient times did chase the Kings out of <hi>Rome,</hi> were written these words,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56425:23"/>
               <hi>Would to God thou wert now living,</hi> Brutus. And upon the Image of <hi>Marcus Brutus,</hi> who then was <hi>Praetor,</hi> and descended from the former <hi>Brutus,</hi> were these words: <hi>Thou sleepest long</hi> Brutus. <hi>Truly thou art not</hi> Brutus. And again: <hi>Thou art dead</hi> Brutus: <hi>Would to God thou wert living, Thou art unworthy of the succession from the</hi> Brute. <hi>Surely thou art not descended from the good</hi> Bru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tus: and such like other writings were set upon these Statues.</p>
            <p>So as for these, and such like reasons, there were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty of the most eminent men in <hi>Rome</hi> that conspired to<note place="margin">A conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> murther <hi>Caesar:</hi> of which the principle were <hi>Decius, Marcus Brutus, Caius Cassius, Gaius Casca, Attilius Cim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Servius Galba, Quintus Ligarius, Marcus Spurius,</hi> &amp;c. who, after diverse consultations, concluded to kill him upon the Ides of <hi>March,</hi> which was the fifteenth day of that moneth, in the Temple where the Senators were to sit that day: Yet <hi>Brutus</hi> was held to be <hi>Caesars</hi> Son, and had received great honours, and many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours<note place="margin">His death foretold.</note> from him. This conspiracy was kept so secret notwithstanding the great number of them, that there was not any one found that discovered the same. But there were so many signes, and Prodigies, and to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self there happened so many forewarnings, that (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing any cause) all men were of opinion that <hi>Caesars</hi> Death was neere at hand. <hi>Spurina</hi> also, who was his Southsayer, forewarned him to look to himself till the Ides of <hi>March</hi> were past: for that his Life was in great danger. And <hi>Caesars</hi> own Wife in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him upon her knees, that he would not that day go to the Senate: For shee had dreamed that he lay dead in her lap. These and such like warnings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed so far with him, that he was about to send to <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> to make his excuse, and to put off the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to another day. But what God hath determined must come to passe; and therefore <hi>Brutus</hi> being present, advised him by no meanes to discover any such fear, and so he resolved to go.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:56425:24"/>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> made small account of Death, and said, <hi>That as for himself he had won power and fame, and glory enough, and that at no time he could die with greater honour.</hi> And some discoursing the night before he was slaine, what Death was best: <hi>Even that</hi> (qouth he) <hi>which is sudden, and least prepensed.</hi> The fifteenth of <hi>March</hi> being come, he went from his House in a Litter towards the Senate, and as he passed along the street, there was a Petition delivered to him, wherein was set down in writing all that was concluded in this conspiracy, and he which gave it, prayed him to read it presently, which he began to doe: but there came so many to speake to him that he could make no farther progresse, and this Paper was found in his hand when he was dead. As he passed on, he met with <hi>Spurina,</hi> the Southsayer, and pleasantly jesting, he said to him, <hi>Dost thou not know</hi> Spurina, <hi>that the Ides of</hi> March <hi>are come?</hi> Yea (answered <hi>Spurina</hi>) and I know that they are not yet past.</p>
            <p>When he came to the Temple where the Senators met, he alighted from his Litter and went in, and having first done Sacrifice (according to the custome) which all that saw persaged to be fatall, and infortunate, he sat him down in his Chair, and <hi>Brutus Albinus</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> at the door with discourse, one of the Conspirators, whose name was <hi>Celer,</hi> came to <hi>Caesar,</hi> under a pretence to intreat him to release a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his from Banishment, and presently all the rest of the conspirators drew neere to his Chair; which when <hi>Caesar</hi> saw, thinking that they had all come for the same purpose, he said unto them, <hi>what force is this?</hi> and at that instant, one of them whose name was <hi>Casca,</hi> beginning, they all drew their poyniards, and Swords which they had privately under their Gowns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and began to wound him. The first blow he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Casca</hi> gave him in the throat: At which <hi>Caesar</hi> said aloude, <hi>What dost thou Traitor</hi> Casca? and wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Poyniard out of his hand, he arose and stabbed
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56425:24"/>
               <hi>Casca</hi> through the Arme, and being about to strike him again, he was prevented by the many wounds which the others gave him, wilest with great force and courage he leaped from one side to the other to defend himself: But when he saw <hi>Marcus Brutus</hi> with his drawn Sword in his hand, wherewith he had already wounded him in the Thigh, he was much amazed, and said in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, <hi>Why how now Son</hi> Brutus? <hi>And thou also?</hi> And having so said, seeing so many wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons<note place="margin">He is slaine.</note> bent against him, and that no body came to his rescue, he remembred to keep the honour of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, with his right hand he covered his Head with part of his Robe, and with his left hand, girt himself and setled his cloathes about him, and being so covered he fell down to the ground, having received three and twenty wounds; and it happened that his fall was at the foot of the seat on which <hi>Pompeys</hi> Statue stood. So in<note place="margin">His cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> this manner died one of the most Mighty, Worthy, Va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lient, Wise, and most successfull Princes, and Captaines that ever was in the World. For, his excellencies, abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, invincible mind, incomparable courage, the Battels which he fought, and Victories which he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: The Provinces, Kings and Nations which he subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; His Counsels, Policies, and Stratagems, and bold attempts: his Magnanimity, clemency, and bounty both to the conquered and Conquerors: the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes which he had proposed to himself a little before he was slaine, being all well weighed and considered, it will plainly appear, that in none of those things afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, nor in any other that may be said of him, there hath been any Heathen King, or Captain that ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled him. And setting apart his ambition, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of rule, he was onely noted, and blamed for being too much given to women.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> was thus slaine in the fifty sixth year of his age, a little more than four years after the Death of <hi>Pompey,</hi> in the seven hundred and tenth year after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> and about fourty and two years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56425:25"/>
the Incarnation of our Blessed Lord and Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> left behind him neither Son nor Daughter legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate at the time of his Death: For though he had been four severall times married, yet he had but one only Daughter, named <hi>Julia,</hi> that was married to <hi>Pompey,</hi> and dyed before him. Wherefore by his last Will, he adopted for his Son, and made his Heire in the<note place="margin">His will.</note> 
               <hi>Dodrant,</hi> that is, in nine parts of twelve of his goods, his Nephew <hi>Octavius Caesar,</hi> after wards called <hi>Octavianus Augustus,</hi> who was the Son of <hi>Acia,</hi> his neece, and of <hi>Octavius Praetor</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> which <hi>Octavius</hi> at this time, was, by the commandment of his Uncle, in the City of <hi>Apollonia,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Epirus,</hi> where he applied himself to his studies, staying for him there, thence to go with him to the <hi>Parthian</hi> War, being now about seventeen years of age.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> being thus slaine, the newes of it ran presently all over the City, and the tumult therein was so great, that no man knew what to doe or say. All Offices ceased, the Temples were all shut up, and every man was ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. <hi>Caesars</hi> Friends were affraid of those that slew him, and they as much feared his Friends, <hi>Brutas, Cassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and the other Conspirators, and others that joyned with them, seeing the great tumult, durst not go to their Houses, nor prosecute their other designs, for fear of <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> whereof the one was Consul, and the other Generall of the Horsemen, but presently from thence they went to seize upon the Capitol, crying by the way as they went, <hi>Liberty, Liberty,</hi> and imploring the favour, and assistance of the People. The rest of that day, and all the next night, <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus</hi> (who took <hi>Caesars</hi> part) were in Armes, and there passed sundry massages, and treaties between them and the Conspirators: At last it was agreed that the Senate should sit, whither <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> came, <hi>M. Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> Sons (by the perswasion of <hi>Cicero,</hi> a great lover of Liberty) remaining as Hostages for them.</p>

               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:56425:25"/>In the Senate they Treated of Peace and concord, and<note place="margin">Peace conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> that all that was past should be buried in perpetuall obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion; whereunto, <hi>Anthony</hi> who was Consul, and the whole Senate agreed: and the Provinces being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, there was algreat liklihood of Peace. For the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate approved, and commended the murther, and the People dissembled their thoughts: For on the one side the authority of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> and the name of <hi>Liberty,</hi> seemed to give them some content: and on the other side, the hainousnesse of the fact, and the love they bare to <hi>Caesar,</hi> did move, and excite them to hate the murtherers, and so all was quiet for the present. But <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> (who affected the Tyranny) took every oportunity to incense the People against them: and <hi>Caesars</hi> Testament being opened, wherein (besides the adopting of his Nehpew <hi>Octavius,</hi> and making him his Heire) besides other bequests, he bequeathed to the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> certaine Gardens, and Lands neere to the River of <hi>Tiber,</hi> and to every Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> a certaine summe of money to be devided amongst them, which being known, much encreased their love to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and made his death more grievous to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesars</hi> Funerall being agreed upon, his Body was burnt with great solemnity in the Field of <hi>Mars,</hi> and <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> made the Funerall Oration in his Praise, and took the Robe wherein <hi>Caesar</hi> was slaine, being all bloudy, and shewed it to the People, using such speeches as provoaked them both to wrath, aud commiseration, so as before the Funerall solemnity was fully finished, they all departed in great fury, taking Brands in their<note place="margin">A tumult.</note> hands from the fire wherein <hi>Caesar</hi> was burned, and went to burnethe Houses of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> and if they could have found them, and the rest of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators, they would certainly have slaine them; and in their fury they unadvisedly slew <hi>Elius Cinna,</hi> by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staking him for <hi>Cornelius Cinna,</hi> who was one of the Conspirators.</p>
            <p>This tumult put <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> and their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56425:26"/>
into such feate, that they all fled from <hi>Rome</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to severall parts: and though the Senate (having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased the tumult) inflicted punishment upon some of the seditions, and had already committed some of them to Prison, yet <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> durst not return to <hi>Rome,</hi> but after a while went into <hi>Greece,</hi> to Govern those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces which <hi>Caesar</hi> in his Life time had allotted unto them, which were, <hi>Macedonia</hi> to <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> to <hi>Cassius.</hi> And truly this was very remarkable, that within the space of three years all the Conspirators dyed, and not one of them of a naturall death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> in his fifth and last Consulship made an Edict, that thanks should be ruturned to <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> the High-Priest<note place="margin">He fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the <hi>Jewes.</hi>
               </note> and Prince of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and to the Nation of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> for their affection to himself and the People of <hi>Rome.</hi> And decreed also, that the said <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> should have the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and repair the Walls of it which <hi>Pompey</hi> had beaten down, and should Govern it as he pleased himself. He also granted to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that every second year there should an abatement be made out of their rents, and that they should be free from Impositions, and Tributes.</p>
            <p>His Name of <hi>Caesar</hi> was so honourable, that all his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors to this present day, have assumed it into their Title, and esteem it an honour to be called <hi>Caesars.</hi>

years old when his Father dyed: and at twelve years old he made an Oration at the Funerall of his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother <hi>Julia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When his Uncle <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> was Warring in <hi>Spain</hi> against the Sons of <hi>Pompey, Octavius</hi> (though he was but<note place="margin">His first imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> young) followed him thither through many and great dangers: and when that War was ended, <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> intending to take him with him to the <hi>Parthian</hi> War, sent him before to the City of <hi>Apollonia,</hi> where he plyed his Book very diligently; and on a time having a minde to see <hi>Theogenes,</hi> a learned. Astronomer, he calculated his Nativity, and promised him great matters, which made <hi>Octavius</hi> conceive great hopes of himself, and in memory thereof he caused certain Medals to be coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and would often boast of what <hi>Theogenes</hi> had told him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavius</hi> in the sixth moneth after he went to <hi>Apollonia,</hi> having intelligence from his Mother of the Death of his<note place="margin">He comes into <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> Uncle <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> he hasted out of <hi>Epirus</hi> to <hi>Brundusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> where he was received by the Army that went to meet him as the adopted Son of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and without any further delay he assumed the name of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to be his Heire, and that so much the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had brought with him good store of money, and great forces that were sent him by his Uncle: and so at <hi>Brundusium,</hi> adopting himself into the <hi>Julian</hi> Family, he called himself <hi>Caius Julius Caesar Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this very Name, as though he had been his true Son, there came great store of partly of his Friends, partly of freed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men, slaves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Souldiers, by whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort to him.</note> more strengthened and imboldned by the multitude of them that flocked to him, and by the authority of the <hi>Caesarian</hi> name, which with the common People was in great reputation, he took his journey towards <hi>Rome</hi> with a great traine, which daily increased like a Floud.</p>
            <p>On the fourteenth Kalends of <hi>May</hi> he entered into
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56425:27"/>
               <hi>Naples,</hi> where he gave <hi>Cicero</hi> a visit. From thence as he was going to <hi>Rome</hi> there met him a vast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany<note place="margin">He comes to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> of his Friends, and as he entered the City, the Globe of the Sun seemed to compasse his Head round like unto a Bow, as it were, putting a Crown upon his Head, who afterward was to be so great a man: and at night, calling together his Friends, he commanded them to be ready the next morning, with good store of followers, to meet him in the Market-place, which was done accordingly; and he going to <hi>Caius,</hi> the City <hi>Praetor,</hi> and Brother to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> he told him that he did accept of the Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For it was the <hi>Roman</hi> custome in Adoptions to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose the authority of the <hi>Praetor:</hi> which acceptance being Regisired by the Scribes, from thence he presently went to <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> the Consul, who behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self<note place="margin">
                  <hi>M. Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's</hi> pride.</note> proudly towards him, and scarcely admitting him into <hi>Pompeys</hi> Gardens, gave him time to speak with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavitanus</hi> had a great mind to revenge the Death of <hi>Julius Caesar;</hi> but by his Mother, and <hi>Philip</hi> his Father in Law he was advised to conceal his Purpose for a time, both because the Senate had approved his Death, and because <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> who was principally to assist him therein, did not shew himself very friendly to him. <hi>Octavianus</hi> understanding that <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> had in his custody all the Treasure that was left by <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> he desired him to command it to be delivered to him, therewith to pay his debts, and to distrubte it as <hi>Caesar</hi> had appointed in his Will: But <hi>Anthony</hi> with greater Pride than <hi>Octavianus</hi> could well bear, not only refused what he demanded, but reproved him for desiring it; whereupon discords presently arose betwixt them: and <hi>Octavianus</hi> strengthened himself with the Counsel of <hi>Cicero,</hi> a great enemy to <hi>Anthony,</hi> and one whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority at that time, by reason of his Wisdom and <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> was very great.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anthony</hi> being Overseer of those things which <hi>Caesar</hi> had
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56425:28"/>
commanded to be done, what by corrupting the Notes,<note place="margin">And fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood.</note> and changing them at his pleasure, did what himself listed, as if it had been the appointment of <hi>Caesan;</hi> by this meanes, gratifying Cities and Governours, and heaping vast summes of money to himself, selling not onely Fields and Tributes, but freedomes and immunities even of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that not onely to particular Persons, but to whole Provinces, and of these things there were Tables hung up all over the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavianus</hi> being nineteen years old, at his own charges gathered an Army, and sought the favour of the People,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> raises<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>an Army.</note> and prepared forces against <hi>Anthony</hi> for his own and the Commonwealths safety. He also stirred up the old Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who by <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> had been planted in Colonies: so that <hi>Anthony</hi> being afraid of him, by the mediation of Friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had a conference with him in the Capitol, and they were for the present reconciled: but within a few dayes, through the whisperings of some, their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity brake our again, and <hi>Anthony,</hi> not thinking himself strong enough, and knowing that the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Macedonia</hi> were the best Souldiers, and six in number, with whom also were many Archers, light harnessed men, and Horsemen, these he sought to draw to himself, who, because of their neernesse, might presently be brought into <hi>Italy:</hi> and thereupon he caused a rumour to be spread, that the <hi>Getae</hi> wasted <hi>Macedonia</hi> by their inrodes; and upon that occasion he demanded an Army of the Senate, saying, that the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Army was raised by <hi>Caesar</hi> against the <hi>Getae,</hi> before he intended the <hi>Parthian</hi> War, whereupon he was chosen Generall of those Forces, and he abtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Law for the change of Provinces, whereby his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cains Anthony</hi> challenged <hi>Macedonia,</hi> which before by lot fell to <hi>Marcus Brutus.</hi>

                  <hi>Anthony</hi> leaves <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>On the seventh of the Ides of <hi>October Anthony</hi> went to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> there to meet foure of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, whom he thought to draw to himself by money.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56425:28"/>
Thither also <hi>Octavianus</hi> sent his Friends with money to hire these Souldiers for himself, and himself posted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Campania,</hi> to engage those Souldiers which were in Colonies to take his part; and first he drew to him the old Souldiers of <hi>Galatia,</hi> then those of <hi>Casilinum</hi> on both sides of <hi>Capua,</hi> giving to each man five hundred pence, by which meanes he gat together about ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, who marched with him under one Ensigne as a guard.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the four Legions of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> accusing <hi>Anthony</hi> for his delayes in revenging <hi>Caesurs</hi> Death, without any acclamations conducted him to the Tribunal, as it were, to hear an account of this matter, and there continued silent. <hi>Anthony</hi> taking this ill, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braded them with their Ingratitude, and complained that they had not brought to him some disturbers of the Peace, who were sent from that malapert young man (for so he called <hi>Octavian</hi>) and to ingratiate himself with them, he promised an hundred pence to each of them, which niggardly promise was intertained with laughter,<note place="margin">His Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simony.</note> which he took so ill, that being returned to his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in the presence of his most converous, and most cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Wife <hi>Fulvia,</hi> he put to death some Centurions out of the <hi>Martian</hi> Legion.</p>
            <p>When those of <hi>Caesars</hi> party, that were sent to corrupt the Souldiers, saw that they were more exasperated by<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> Policy.</note> this deed, they scattered Libels about the Army, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they disgraced <hi>Anthony,</hi> and extolled the liberality of <hi>Caesar.</hi> And when some sided with <hi>Octavian,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with <hi>Anthony,</hi> the Army, as if it had been set to sale at an outery, addicted themselves to him that would give most. And because that <hi>Decius Brutus,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Gallia Cisalpirea</hi> (now <hi>Lombardy</hi>) opposed <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> he went to besiege him in the City of <hi>Mutina</hi> (now <hi>Modena</hi>) which being known in <hi>Rome, Cicero</hi> his authority and credit in the Senate was such, that <hi>Mark</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anthony</hi> declared an enemy.</note> 
               <hi>Anthony</hi> was declared an enemy to the State, and the new Consuls, <hi>Hircius</hi> and <hi>Pansa</hi> were sem against him,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56425:29"/>
and with them was <hi>Octavian</hi> sent with Ensignes of a Consul, and Title of a <hi>Pro-praetor,</hi> having been first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Senate though so young, which was done by the procurement of <hi>Cicero,</hi> though he afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quited him ill for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavian</hi> with the Consuls, drew neer to <hi>Mark An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony, Cicero</hi> remaining to command in chief in all matters at <hi>Rome:</hi> and between the two Armies there passed many skirmishes and encounters, and at last they came to a Battell, wherein the Consuls and <hi>Caesar</hi> had the Victory, but <hi>Hircius</hi> was slaine in the Battell, and<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomes him.</note> 
               <hi>Pansa</hi> was so wounded, that he died within a few dayes after, and both the Armies of the slaine Consuls obeyed <hi>Caesar.</hi> By this meanes <hi>D. Brutus</hi> was freed from his siege, and <hi>Anthony</hi> was forced to forsake <hi>Italy</hi> by a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable flight, leaving his baggage behind him. In this service <hi>Octavian</hi> made marvelous proof of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, being but twenty years old, performing the Office, not onely of a good Captaine, but also of a stout Souldier: For seeing the Standart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bearer sore wounded and ready to fall, <hi>Octavian</hi> took from him the Eagle, and bare it a great while till he had lodged it in safety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> after the Battell, gathering the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders<note place="margin">He fliesin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> of his Army, passed the <hi>Alps</hi> and went into <hi>France,</hi> solliciting the Friendship of <hi>Lepidus,</hi> who was there with an Army ever since the Death of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> whom after some treaties he made his Friend: and <hi>Octavian</hi> after the Victory obtained, presently sent to the Senate to require a Triumph for his Victory, as also the Counsulship for the remainder of the year in the roome of the dead Consuls, with their succession in their charge, and command of the Army. But the answer of the Senate was not according to his desire: For the Friends and Kinsmen of those that had murthered <hi>Caesar</hi> began to fear him, and to suspect his power, wherefore they prevailed to delay that which he required, and in the end they resolved to assign the Army to <hi>Decius Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:56425:29"/>
and temporizing with <hi>Octavian,</hi> they granted him a Triumph, but denied him the Consulship, whereat he was much discontented, and therefore secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treated of friendship with <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> and having drawn to himself the affections of the Army, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> makes himself Consul.</note> marched towards <hi>Rome,</hi> and approaching near to the City, in dispite of the Senate, he caused himself to be chosen Consul being not fully twenty years old. Then did he cause accusations to be exhibited against <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> and the rest of the Conspirators; and in their absence, having none that durst defend their cause, they were condemned. After this was done he left the City, and with his Army marched toward <hi>Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> who were already entred into <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Decius Brutus</hi> hearing of the Treaties and League that was made between <hi>Octavian, Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Mark Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> not daring to stay in that Country, departed with his Army, which soon forsook him, some going to <hi>Caesar,</hi> others to <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> whereupon he fled, but being at last taken, he was brought to <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> who caused his Head to be cut off. The Armies of these Captaines drawing neere toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to whom <hi>Assinius Pollio,</hi> and <hi>Plancus,</hi> with their Legions were joyned, these three <hi>Octavian Caesar, Mark Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> meeting, after three dayes debate, they concluded their accursed Peace; and these firebrands of sedition entered into a <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> with<note place="margin">A Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</note> severall intents and designes. <hi>Lepidus</hi> was covetous, and sought riches by troubling the State. <hi>Anthony</hi> was by nature an enemy to Peace, and to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, desiring an opportunity to be revenged of those who had declared him an enemy to the State. And <hi>Octavian</hi> sought revenge upon <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> and those who had slaine his adopted Father. And to bring these things to passe, <hi>Octavian</hi> put away his Wife who was Daughter to <hi>Servilius,</hi> and contracted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>Claudia,</hi> Daughter in Law to <hi>Anthony</hi> by
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56425:30"/>
his Wife <hi>Fulvia,</hi> who was now a child, and from whom he was afterward divorced by reason of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord that arose between <hi>Anthony</hi> and him.</p>
            <p>In this League which they made, besides dividing the Provinces amongst themselves, they agreed to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe and kill each of them his enemies, and the one<note place="margin">Many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</note> delivered them into the others hands, having more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to be revenged upon an enemy then to save a Friend; and so there was made the most cruel and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane Proscription, and Butchery that ever was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heard of, giving and exchanging Friends, and Kinsmen for enemies. For <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> gave up his Fathers Brother: and <hi>Lepidus</hi> his own Brother, <hi>Lucius</hi>

               <hi>Paulus:</hi> and <hi>Octavian; M. T. Cicero,</hi> whom he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Father, and who had intreated and honoured him as a Son. And besides these, they Proscribed and condemned to die three hundred other Principall men of <hi>Rome,</hi> amongst whom were about one hundred and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Senators, besides two thousand <hi>Romans</hi> of the order of Knighthood.</p>
            <p>This agreement being made, they all three went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they took upon them the Government of the Commonwealth by the name of <hi>Triumvirat,</hi> the time being limited to five years, though they never meant to leave the same. And presently after, those who were condemned and Proscribed, were by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement put to death, being sought out in all parts and places; their Houses were ransacked, and their goods confiscated.</p>

The <hi>Egnaces;</hi> the Father and Son, embracing one the other were both run through at once and slaine. <hi>C. Hosidius Geta,</hi> was put into a grave by his Son as dead, who sustained and kept

               <hi>Tanusia</hi> was such an importunate suitor to <hi>Caesar</hi> for her Husband <hi>T.

            <p>But the Wife of <hi>Septimius,</hi> having shamefully given her Body to one of <hi>Anthonies</hi> Familiars, caused her<note place="margin">Wives bad.</note> Husband to be put into the number of the Poscripts, that she might the more freely continue her Adulteries, and her Husband was slaine by her meanes. <hi>Q.

               <hi>P.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56425:31"/>
the hands of two of his Freedmen as much as would have relieved him in his Banishment, but they ran away with all, whereupon he delivered himself to the murtherers. <hi>Haterius,</hi> who had hid himself in a very secret place, was sold and betrayed by his slave, and killed. <hi>Cassius Varus</hi> who was betrayed by a slave made free, had his Head struck off. <hi>Caius Plotius</hi> was hiden by his slaves, but being given to Perfumes, the sent thereof discovered him; yet when the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers could not find him, they cruelly tormented his<note place="margin">Servants good.</note> Servants to make them confesse where he was, which yet they would not do: But the Master pitting his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full servants, came out of his secret place, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself to the murtherers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> changed his Gown with his slave, who in that habit presented himself to the murtherers, and was slain by them instead of his Master. Another slave of <hi>Menius</hi> did the like: for he went into his Masters Litter, and offered his neck to the murtherers, who cut off his Head, and so his Master escaped into <hi>Sicily.</hi> The slave of <hi>Urbinus Panopio,</hi> hearing that the murtherers were comming to his Masters House, took off his Gown and his Ring, and gave him his own apparrel, and put him out at a back doore: then he went up and lay upon his Masters Bed, where he boldly attended them that killed him for <hi>Panopio.</hi> The slave of <hi>Antius Restio,</hi> though his Master had soundly beaten him a few dayes before for some knavish tricks, yet to save his Master, meeting an old man by the way, he struck off his Head, and shewing that, with his whippings to the murtherers, he made them believe that thus he had revenged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of his Master, with whom he shortly after fled into <hi>Sicily.</hi> The slaves of <hi>Martius Censorinus</hi> kept their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster secretly, till he had oportunity to escape into <hi>Sicily</hi> to <hi>Sextus Pompeius.</hi>

him into <hi>Sicily,</hi> where all the poor distressed <hi>Romans</hi> were courteously intertained by <hi>S. Pompeius,</hi> who sent forth Ships, and Galleys to lie upon the coast of <hi>Italy,</hi> ready to receive all them that fled to him; doubly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding those that saved any that was Proscribed: He gave also honourable Offices to all that had been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls, and comforting the rest with singular courtesie. Many others fled into <hi>Macedonia</hi> to <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius:</hi> others into <hi>Africk</hi> to <hi>Cornificius. Statius Samnis,</hi> an honourable Senator being about eighty years old, that those Theeves might have no part of his Goods, he gave them for a prey to whomsoever would take them; then setting his House on fire he burnt himself in it. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponius</hi> having been long concealed by his slave, grew weary of that confinement, came out into the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, and yeilded his neck to the murtherers. <hi>Cesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> being in the like condition, caused his slaves, to make a great fire, threw himself into it and died: <hi>Sulpitus Rufus,</hi> who had been Consul, was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thred because he would not sell an Isle of his to <hi>Fulvia:</hi> also <hi>Ampius Balbus</hi> was slaine, because he<note place="margin">A <hi>Jeza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>M.

            <p>The <hi>Triumviri</hi> caused the goods of the Proscripts to be sold by the Drum, at such prizes as the Souldiers pleased, yet most part of them was spoiled and given
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56425:32"/>
away. They promised also to Widdowes their Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to Sons the tenth part of their Fathers Patrimony, and to Daughters the twentieth part, but few or none had any benefit by this promise; yea, on the contrary, they sacked many of them that demanded<note place="margin">Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> these rights. They exacted great summes of money in <hi>Rome,</hi> and all over <hi>Italy;</hi> and to encourage the Souldiers, they gave them unmeasurable gifts, and granted them daily new pillage. The Legions they Wintered in the richest Cities upon free Quarter. To be short, men by fear and custome were so inured to slavery, that they became more slaves than the Tyrants would have had them.</p>
            <p>These three men having done what they would in <hi>Rome,</hi> and knowing that <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> had a very great Army in <hi>Greece,</hi> who called themselves the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverers of their Country,</hi> saying that they would go and and set <hi>Rome</hi> at liberty from oppression: <hi>Cassius</hi> having overthrown and slaine <hi>Dolabella</hi> in <hi>Syria:</hi> and being informed, that by the assistance of their Friends, they had gotten together eighteen Legions, hereupon <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Octavian</hi> resolved to go against them with the greatest Army that they could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly make of old Souldiers, and that <hi>Lepidus</hi> should stay to guard <hi>Rome:</hi> and accordingly they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">They go against <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius.</hi>
               </note> and arrived in <hi>Greece,</hi> and marching on, they drew neer to the place where <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> were encamped, which was in <hi>Macedonia</hi> in the <hi>Philippick</hi> Fields.</p>
            <p>Before they came to joyn Battell there were sundry<note place="margin">Prodigeis.</note> Prodigies: for fowles of prey hovered about the Camp of <hi>Brutus</hi> as if it had been their own already: and as they marched out to Battell, a Blackmoore met them, which they accounted an ill <hi>Omen. Brutus</hi> being alone in his Tent at night, a man sad and gastly appeared to him, and being asked what he was, he answered, <hi>I</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> 
               <hi>am they evill Genius,</hi> and so vanished: But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Birds, and Beasts promised good successe to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar.</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:56425:33"/>
These Armies lying so neere together had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent skirmishes, and at last came to a Battell, where the Victory was strangely divided: For <hi>Brutus</hi> on the<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Brutus</hi> beats <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar. M. Anthony</hi> beats <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius.</hi>
               </note> one side of the Field, did beat <hi>Octavian,</hi> and put his Battalion to rout, pursuing them into the Camp, where many of them were slaine; and while <hi>Brutus</hi> was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his Victory, his partner <hi>Cassius</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> though he did all that was possible to encourage his men, and by reason of the clouds of dust, knew nothing of <hi>Brutus</hi> his Victory, whereupon retiring to an high ground, he there pitched his Tent: and so standing and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about, he saw <hi>Brutus</hi> his Troops comming to his aid, and to relieve him; but he imagining that they came flying before their enemies, commanded a slave of his whom he had made free to kill him, who did it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavians</hi> men that escaped by flight, retired to <hi>Mark Anthonies</hi> Camp, and had not <hi>Brutus</hi> his men busied themselves in ransacking <hi>Octavians</hi> Camp, they had that day, obtained an intire Victory: for they might in due time have rescued, and relieved <hi>Cassius,</hi> and both of them being joyned together might easily have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown <hi>Mark Anthony:</hi> but God had otherwise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. The Victory being thus devided, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of either party gathered their forces together, and of <hi>Brutus</hi> side, were slaine eight thousand men, and of the enemies side a far greater number. <hi>Brutus</hi> did his best to encourage and comfort his Souldiers, and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which followed <hi>Cassius:</hi> and the next day, though both Armies were put in Battell array, yet they fought not; but a few dayes after, <hi>Brutus,</hi> by his Souldiers, was forced to come to an other Battell, who was of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self willing rather to delay and prolong the War, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his enemies wanted Victuals, and many other necessaries, and because he reposed no great trust in the forces of <hi>Cassius:</hi> for he found that they were fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Brutus</hi> beaten.</note> and hard to be commanded because of their late o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56425:33"/>
When they came to the second encounter, <hi>Brutus</hi> did all the Offices of an able Generall, and of a Valiant Knight, yet in the end his men were broken, and overthown by the enemy. <hi>Burtus</hi> having gathered his scattered Troops together, found himself unable to make any further resistance, and being advised by some of his Friends to fly, he told them, <hi>That so be would, yet not with his feet but with his hands,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, taking a Sword from a servant of his called <hi>Stratus,</hi> he slew himself. Thus <hi>Octavian,</hi> and <hi>Mark An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
               <note place="margin">Kills him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</note> remained Victors, and Masters of the Field, and all things succeeded according to <hi>Caesars</hi> desire, for whom, God in his secret Counsell, had reserved the Monarchy of the whole World, which for the present was devided between three.</p>
            <p>These Wars being ended, and the Legions of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> reduced to the obedience of the Conquerors, <hi>Octavian,</hi> and <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> agreed, and resolved, that <hi>Anthony</hi> should remaine to Govern <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> that <hi>Lepidus</hi> should go into <hi>Africk,</hi> and that <hi>Octavian</hi> should returne to <hi>Rome:</hi> and accordingly <hi>Mark An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> went into <hi>Asia,</hi> where he gave himself up to sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anthony</hi> With <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opatra.</hi>
               </note> and delights with the fair, but wanton <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> Queen of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Octavian,</hi> though with some hindrances, by reason of his health, at last came to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long after there arose new Wars and troubles for though <hi>Octavian</hi> was at peace with <hi>Lepidus</hi> who was now in <hi>Africk, Octavian</hi> having under his command<note place="margin">Troubles in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Spain, France,</hi> part of <hi>Germany, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Illyricum,</hi> yet <hi>Lucius Antonius,</hi> who at this time was Consul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provoked thereto by his Sister in Law <hi>Fulvia,</hi> Wife to <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> began to oppose himself against <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus</hi> and <hi>Octavian,</hi> seeking to overthrow the <hi>Triumvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> which contention brake out about the division of Fields which <hi>Caesar</hi> had made to the Souldiers which had served him in his Wars. Some say that <hi>Fulvia</hi> made this stirre, that she might procure the return of <hi>Mark An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:56425:34"/>
to her, of whom she was jealous, hearing of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> The discord in <hi>Rome</hi> grew to that height that they came to Armes; and <hi>Lucius Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> went from the City, and levied an Army against <hi>Octavian,</hi> who also marched towards him with his Forces. But <hi>Lucius</hi> not daring to joine Battell, shut himself up in <hi>Perugia,</hi> where <hi>Caesar</hi> immediately besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and divorced himself from <hi>Claudia,</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Fulvia,</hi> and was married to his third Wife, <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonia</hi> by whom he had one only Daughter. <hi>Octavian</hi> being about twenty three years old, so strictly besieged <hi>Perugia</hi> that <hi>Lucius</hi> and his men were brought to such<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> Victory.</note> straits for want of Victuals, that he was forced to yeild up himself to <hi>Octavian,</hi> who pardoned him, and used him kindly, and thus this War was ended without bloudshed. And so <hi>Octavian</hi> returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> of which he was now sole Lord: and from hence some reckon the beginning of his Empire which was about four years after the Death of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> and about thirty eight years before the Incarnation of our blessed Lord and Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> being now in quiet, <hi>Fulvia</hi> by letters, and false informations sought to stirre-up her Husband <hi>Mark An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> against <hi>Octavian,</hi> with which resolution she left <hi>Italy,</hi> and went towards him; and at the same time <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> departed from <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and came to the Isle of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> where he was informed of all that had happened to his Brother <hi>Lucius.</hi> From thence he went into <hi>Greece,</hi> and at <hi>Athens</hi> he found his Wife <hi>Fulvia</hi> sick, yet vehemently inveying against <hi>Octavian:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Authony</hi> comes into <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> wherefore leaving her there, he went with two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Gallies into <hi>Italy,</hi> and landed at <hi>Brundusium,</hi> where the Wars began between him and the Forces of <hi>Octavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> who was yet at <hi>Rome.</hi> But newes comming of <hi>Fulvias</hi> death, some Friends interposed to reconcile them, and at last it was agreed, that Arbitrators should be chosen to compose their differences. <hi>Octavian</hi> chose <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> and for <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> was <hi>Asinius Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:56425:34"/>
and these brought it to this issue, that <hi>Mark An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> should have all the East from <hi>Italy,</hi> beginning from the <hi>Jonian</hi> Sea, which is the entry into the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Gulph,</hi> unto the River of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> wherein were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all the Provinces of <hi>Graecia</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> with all the<note place="margin">Peace made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt them.</note> Islands within these limits.

And for the strengthening of this League, <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> now a Widdower, was to marry with <hi>Octavia,</hi> the Sister of <hi>Octavian</hi> by the Fathers side, formerly married to <hi>Mareus Marcellus,</hi> by whom she had one Son called also <hi>Marcellus,</hi> whom <hi>Octavian</hi> adopted. And this marriage was dispensed with by the Senate, because in <hi>Rome,</hi> Widdows were not permitted to marry till they had lived ten moneths in Widdowhood, which she had not done.</p>
            <p>This being concluded, <hi>Octavian,</hi> and <hi>Mark Anthony</hi>

                  <hi>Anthony</hi> marries <hi>Octavia.</hi>
               </note> went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where the wedding was solemnized, and they were seemingly good Friends; but their Peace was disquieted by the Neighbourhood of <hi>Sextus Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius,</hi> who commanded the Seas from <hi>Sicily</hi> where he lived, and with his Ships, and Pirates, he disquited <hi>Caesars</hi> Friends, who thereupon resolved to ruine him: But at the request of the Senate, and of <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> he harkned to Peace, and by the mediation of Friends,<note place="margin">They are reconciled with <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey.</hi>
               </note> it was agreed that all matters past should be forgotten, &amp; that they should live like good Nighbours and Friends, and that <hi>Sextus Pompey</hi> should enjoy <hi>Sicily, Sardinia,</hi> and <hi>Corsica</hi> which he had in possession, and that he should cleere the Seas from Pirates that Marchants and passengers might passe safely, and that he should furnish <hi>Rome</hi> yearly with a certaine quantity of Corne. This being concluded, they agreed upon a meeting of all three upon the Sea side in the straight of <hi>Messina,</hi> in a Fortresse built for that purpose which reached into
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56425:35"/>
the Water, whither <hi>Sextus Pompey</hi> might come with his Galleys and be in safety: which accordingly was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with great joy and solemnity; and <hi>Sextus Pompey</hi> feasted them in his Galleys, and they likewise him by Land.</p>
            <p>From hence <hi>Sextus Pompey</hi> returned into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Octavian</hi> and <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> where for a while they remained in great familiarity: and then <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> preparing for his journey into the East, sent <hi>Ventidius</hi> before him with a great Army against the <hi>Parthians,</hi> wherein he had so good successe, that he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame and defeated <hi>Pacorus,</hi> the <hi>Parthian</hi> Kings<note place="margin">The <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> bea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ten.</note> Son, and slew twenty thousand of his men, and thereby sufficiently revenged the Death of <hi>Marcus Crassus,</hi> for which he afterwards Triumphed at <hi>Rome.</hi>

in a storme, he sent his intire Friend <hi>Mecenas</hi> to <hi>Mark An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi> at whose intreaty he returned into <hi>Italy</hi> with three hundred Ships and Galleys, giving it out that he came to <hi>Caesars</hi> aid. And though there were some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between them, yet <hi>Octavia</hi> so laboured between her Husband and Brother, that she reconciled them, and so they met in the mouth of the River neer <hi>Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> where <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> gave to <hi>Octavian</hi> one hundred and twenty of his Galleys for his Wars, and <hi>Octavian</hi> gave to him some of the <hi>Italian</hi> Souldiers, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed their <hi>Triumvirat</hi> for other five years. Which done, <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> returned to the East to prosecute his Wars against the <hi>Parthians,</hi> his Wife <hi>Octavia</hi> and her Children remaining in <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anthony</hi> being gone, <hi>Octavian</hi> resolving to prosecute<note place="margin">Wars against him.</note> the Wars against <hi>Sextus Pompey</hi> with all his Forces, armed two Navies, whereof <hi>Agrippa</hi> was the Admirall of the one, and himself of the other: He sent also to <hi>Lepidus</hi> intreaing his aid, who accordingly came and brought with him a Thousand Ships, little and great, and eighty Galleys, wherein he transported five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Horse, and twelve Legions of Foot Souldiers. <hi>Sextus Pompey</hi> hearing what great preparations were made against him, did strongly fortifie all the Sea-coasts of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and on the frontiers of <hi>Africk;</hi> neere to <hi>Lilibaeum,</hi> he placed <hi>Plinius,</hi> a good Captain with good companies of Souldiers, and his whole Fleet by Sea he drew into the Port of <hi>Messina,</hi> purposing to mannage his Wars by Sea, having neither experience, nor power to do it by Land, and so he attended the comming of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lepidus</hi> loosing with his whole Fleet from <hi>Africk,</hi> was encountered with a tempest, wherein with the losse of a great part of his Navy, he, with the rest landed at <hi>Lilybaeum,</hi> and took in certaine places there about, but having small judgement, and experience in the Wars, he made a greater noise then did hurt to <hi>Pompey. Octavius</hi> also being at Sea in a tempest, lost thirty of his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56425:36"/>
Galleys, besides small Ships, and with much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty returned to <hi>Italy:</hi> and <hi>Taurus,</hi> who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Galleys which <hi>Anthony</hi> left, landed at <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentum,</hi> though with great losse and danger. <hi>Octavian</hi> was so grieved at these losses, that he had thoughts of giving over the War for that yeer: but changing his mind, he repaired his Fleets, and ordered <hi>Agrippa,</hi> with one of them to passe into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and there to make War both by Sea and Land: and himself following with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fleet did the like.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Octavian</hi> divorced himself from <hi>Scribonia,</hi> though he had a Daughter by her called <hi>Livia,</hi> and then he married <hi>Livia Drusilla,</hi> Wife to <hi>Tiberius</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> marries <hi>Livia.</hi>

               <hi>Nero,</hi> by whom she had a Son called also <hi>Tiberius;</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Tiberius</hi> was forced to leave her to please <hi>Octavian,</hi> though at this time she was with child of a Son. This <hi>Livia</hi> he loved deerly, and continned with her till his Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agrippa</hi> assaulted, and took in some places in <hi>Sicily,</hi> which <hi>Pompey</hi> hearing of, departed from <hi>Messina</hi> with one hundred and seventy five Galleys, to relive them, and <hi>Agrippa</hi> being advertised of his comming, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to meet him, his Galleys being almost equall in number, and so they joyned Battell, which for a time seemed to be equall, but at last <hi>Agrippa</hi> prevailed, and <hi>Pompey</hi> rerreated in time, his Galleys and Foists with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing<note place="margin">

In this fight <hi>Pompey</hi> lost thirty of his Galleys. <hi>Agrippa</hi> the next day went to a City called <hi>Tindaria,</hi> thinking to surprise it by reason of intelligence which he had with the Citizens: and <hi>Pompey</hi> in the night gave secret order to his whole Fleet to retire to <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavian</hi> in the mean time imbarked a great part of his Army, which he landed in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and set them on shore under the command of <hi>Cornificius,</hi> little thinking that <hi>Pompey</hi> had been so neer, who if he had taken this

Then did <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> saile out of <hi>Messina</hi> with his whole Fleet, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parties refusing it, they came to a Battell, in which <hi>Octavian</hi> was overcome, and all his great Fleet scattered<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> beaten.</note> and lost, and himself driven to fly into <hi>Italy</hi> in a Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine, where through many dangers, he at last came to the Army, whereof <hi>Mesalla</hi> was Generall, and being nothing discouraged with this losse, he presently took order for all that was needfull. To <hi>Rome</hi> he sent his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Friend <hi>Mecenas,</hi> to take order that this newes should breed no alteration there, and then presently sent to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> the Admirall of his other Fleet, that he should with all speed succour <hi>Cornificius</hi> and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and to <hi>Lepidus</hi> he sent to desire him to make his present repaire to the Isle of <hi>Lippari,</hi> which is between <hi>Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Calabria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His diligence and good order about these affairs was such, that in a short time, by the help of <hi>Lepidus,</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> in dispite of <hi>Pompey,</hi> he landed all his Forces in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and joyning with <hi>Lepidus,</hi> he encamped neer to <hi>Messina,</hi> where began a most cruel War both by Sea, and Land, wherein the power and sufficiency of <hi>Pompey</hi> did wonderfully appear, in that he was able to grapple with so potent adversaries. Yet seeing himself oppressed, he sent a challenge to <hi>Octavian,</hi> that to avoid the further effusion of bloud, he would try it out with him in a Navall fight, so many Ships and Galleys against so many. <hi>Ostavian</hi> delayed him at the first, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they agreed that with three hundred Ships and Galleys on either side, they would meet in such a place, and there fight it out, and accordingly they prepared for the Battell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavian</hi> leaving <hi>Lepidus</hi> with his Land Army, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked himself in his Fleet, and <hi>Pompey</hi> did the like, and so they joyned Battell, which was one of the cruelest

that ever was, considering the Commanders and the strength on either side, where <hi>Pompey,</hi> after he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed all the Offices of a good and Valiant Captain, and after the slaughter of multitudes on both sides, was overcome by <hi>Octavian,</hi> and all his Fleet was burnt and<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>In this War <hi>Octavian</hi> escaped many dangers. For having transported part of his Army into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> dangers.</note> sailing back to fetch the rest, he was suddenly supprised by <hi>Demochares,</hi> and <hi>Apolaphanes,</hi> two of <hi>Pompeys</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, from whom he escaped with much difficulty with one only Ship. Then travelling by Land to <hi>Rhegiuns,</hi> he saw some of <hi>Pompeys</hi> Galleys neer to the shore, and supposing them to be his own, he went down to the Sea side, where he had like to have been taken by them; and then seeking to escape by unknown passages, he met with a slave of <hi>Aemilius Paulus,</hi> who remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that he had proscribed his Master <hi>Paulus,</hi> Father to this <hi>Aemilius,</hi> he attempted to kill him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavian</hi> having obtained this great Victory aforesaid, though with very great losse, he went to Land with the remainder of his Ships and Army, comanding <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> to joyn with <hi>Lepidus,</hi> and to go to <hi>Messina,</hi> whither <hi>Pliny, Pompeys</hi> Generall had retired himself. But not thinking good to stand upon his defence, now that his Master was fled, he yeilded himself to <hi>Lepidus</hi> with all his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56425:38"/>
Legions: This made <hi>Lepidus</hi> so proud, that affecting to have <hi>Sicily</hi> to himself, he contended with <hi>Octavian</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout<note place="margin">He falls out with <hi>Lepidus.</hi>
               </note> it: and entering into the City of <hi>Messina,</hi> he placed a Garison in it, to hold it for his own use: The like he did in many other places of the Island: and when <hi>Octavian</hi> came, he desired to speak with him, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complaining of his proceedings.</p>
            <p>But in Rule, and Dominion equallity is intollerable, whilst either of them coveted this Isle for himself they fell at variance, and <hi>Octavian</hi> made his Navy to draw neere to the shore: So that both Armies began to stand upon their guard, the one against the other, and many messages passed between them, yet could they not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. But <hi>Octavian</hi> was far better beloved and esteemd by the men of War, for his many vertues, and Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and for his Name-sake [<hi>Julius Caesar,</hi>] then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Souldiers began to lay all the fault upon <hi>Lepidus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Octavian</hi> understanding this, laboured secretly to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Lepidus</hi> overcome.</note> to be given, and commanded his men to sally out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Octavian,</hi> but when they came forth, most of them joyned with him: so that <hi>Lepidus</hi> seeing himself in danger of beig forsaken of his whole Army, yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself unto <hi>Caesar,</hi> and putting off his Generals Robe, he went to his Tent, and submitted to him. <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> received him as if he had never offended, very courteously, and honourably, but restored him neither to his State nor power, and sent him with a good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to <hi>Rome,</hi> without any Office but the High Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, which he had held ever since the Death of <hi>Julius Caesar:</hi> and so this difference was ended without bloudshed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:56425:39"/>
               <hi>Octavian</hi> now retaining <hi>Sicily</hi> to himself, and having devested <hi>Lepidus</hi> of the <hi>Triumvirat,</hi> he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to himself the Province of <hi>Africk,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained Generall of the three Armies, to wit, of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus,</hi> of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and of his own; wherein were fourty five Legions of Footmen, and twenty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Horse, all well armed, besides many other <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</hi> He had also upon the Sea, six hundred Galleys and many Ships, and Brigandines. And now waited only for an opportunity to fall out with <hi>Mark Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> that he might make himself Lord of all. Yet for the present he paid his Souldiers as well as he could, and gave Coronets, Honours, and Armes to those who had deserved well in these Wars. He then dispered his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, sending them to their own homes, loaden with many faire promises. He also left, and sent <hi>Praetors</hi> and Governours into <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> and so hasted<note place="margin">

               </note> towards <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was received with Ovation (which was little lesse than a Triumph) with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible joy and honour: and was so exceedingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, that in many places they erected Temples and Altars to him, as to their Gods: and he reformed such things as by reason of the Wars were grown out of order.</p>
            <p>At this time <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> who was in the East, though he had no great successe in his <hi>Parthian</hi> War, yet was he still of great power, very Rich, and well obeyed in the Provinces of <hi>Greece, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and in<note place="margin">

               </note> the rest of his Governments. But he was so besotted with the love, and company of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> the Queen of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that he thought of nothing but how to satisfie her humour, in the meane time neglecting, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Wife <hi>Octavia,</hi> the Sister of <hi>Octavian,</hi> who in beauty and Wisdom was nothing inferior to <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi> and in virtue and goodnesse did far excell her.</p>
            <p>The Monarchy of the World being thus devided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two, the one in the East, the other in the West,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56425:39"/>
yet, as though each of them had not enough, they studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each of them to supplant, and destroy the other. Chiefly <hi>Octavian,</hi> who seeing that <hi>Anthony</hi> neglected<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> seeks a quarrill with him.</note> his Sister, and did not send for her, he continually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, and urged her to go to her Husband, that he might have a fair occasion to fall out with him if she were not well intertained: But she, not well understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his designe, that she might prevent all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies between her Brother and her Husband, departed from <hi>Rome,</hi> carrying with her many Jewels, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents which she had gotten together therewith to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Mark Anthony.</hi> But he, having fixed his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heart upon <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> wrote to her by the way that she should go into <hi>Greece,</hi> and stay at <hi>Athens,</hi> till he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the <hi>Parthian</hi> War, yet did he never go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, <hi>Cleopatra</hi> hindering him. Notwithstanding <hi>Octavia</hi> sent all those things which she had brought, to her Husband, and all this not prevailing to procure her acceptence, she went full of griefe, to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then did <hi>Octavian</hi> begin openly to complain of <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> and to declared himself his enemy, and <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> entered into a League with the King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> the better to strengthen himself, causing <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi> (besides the Title of <hi>Aegypt</hi>) to be called Queen of <hi>Syria, Lybia,</hi> and <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and joyntly with her, a Son of hers called <hi>Caesarion,</hi> of whom <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> left her with child when he was in <hi>Aegypt:</hi> and to two Sons which himself had by her, called <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> he gave the Title of Kings: to <hi>Alexander,</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> and <hi>Parthia:</hi> and to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and <hi>Phoenicia,;</hi> hereupon the enmity between <hi>Octavian</hi> and him greatly encreased: yet was the War deferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of other Wars which <hi>Octavian</hi> had in <hi>Illyricum,</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia.</hi> The People of these Countries, seeing<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> new troubles.</note> the <hi>Romans</hi> engaged in Civil Wars, rebelled, together with those of <hi>Austria, Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them. This War <hi>Octavian</hi> undertook in his own person, which was very cruel and dangerous:
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56425:40"/>
wherein he was twice wounded, and gave great proof both of his Wisdome and Valour: yet in the end, he not only subdued and tamed <hi>Illyricum,</hi> but both the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia</hi>'s, and all the neighbouring Nations which had joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them.</p>
            <p>Then did <hi>Octavian</hi> return Victorious to <hi>Rome,</hi> and though a Triumph was granted him, yet would he not Triumph as then, so great was his desire to make War against <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> who was no better affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. For he levied Souldiers, procured Friends, and Armies against him, and promised <hi>Cleopatra</hi> to bring her Tryumphing into <hi>Rome.</hi> Yea, she requested of him, the Rule and Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> and he promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it her.</p>
            <p>Matters standing upon these tearmes, <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> sent his Wife <hi>Octavia</hi> a Bill of Divorce, according to the custome of those times, commanding her to go out of his House wherein she dwelt in <hi>Rome.</hi> This, and other<note place="margin">Qurrals betwixt them.</note> indignities <hi>Octavian</hi> imparted to the Senate, complaining against <hi>Anthony,</hi> and in his Orations to the People, he accused him for that (the second five years of his <hi>Triumvirat</hi> and League being expired) yet came he not to <hi>Rome,</hi> neither respecting the authority of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, nor of the People, but held his place, and kept possession of the East and of <hi>Greece:</hi> and by such suggestions he incensed the People against him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> on the other side, by Letters and Messengers, complained that <hi>Octavian</hi> had often broken the Peace, and had cast <hi>Sextus Pompey</hi> out of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi> retaining that, and other places which he held, to himself: and that therein he had no respect of him, nor had given him any part thereof: and that he detained the Galleys which he had lent him for that War. As also that he had deprived <hi>Lepidus</hi> of his Government, and kept all those Provinces, and all the Legions which were his, without imparting any share thereof to him: and that he had divided all the Lands in <hi>Italy</hi> to his own Souldiers, not assigning any part thereof to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56425:40"/>
his. Thus the one accused the other, either pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were forced to undertake the War; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the truth is, it was their Ambition, and insatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to Rule that pricked them forward to it. Hereupon they called diverse Nations to their aid, so as the whole World in a manner, either of one side or other, was in Armes. Those in the West for <hi>Octavian,</hi> and those in<note place="margin">Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for War.</note> the East for <hi>Anthony:</hi> at least, the beast and choisest men of them all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anthony</hi> was first in the Field, and came with a great Army to the famous City of <hi>Ephesus</hi> in <hi>Jonia,</hi> a Province of <hi>Asia</hi> the lesse, whither he had sent for his Navy to transport him into <hi>Europe.</hi> And he had in readinesse eight hundred Galleys and Ships of burthen: two hundred whereof <hi>Cleopatra</hi> gave him, together with all the Ammunition, and Victuals necessary for the Fleet: He also took her along with him, contrary to the advise of all those which were of his Councel. Then sailed he to the Isle of <hi>Samos,</hi> to which he had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Kings, Tetrachs, and People which served him in this War, to come by a day perfixed. The Kings that met him there, were <hi>Tarcondemus,</hi> King of the upper <hi>Cilicia: Archalaus,</hi> of <hi>Cappadocia: Philodel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> of <hi>Paphlagonia; Methridates,</hi> of <hi>Comagena,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Besides those which sent their Forces, as <hi>Herod,</hi> King of <hi>Judaea: Amyntas,</hi> of <hi>Lyeaonia:</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Arabia:</hi> Of the <hi>Medes:</hi> and <hi>Palemon,</hi> King of <hi>Pontus</hi> with some others. So that he had one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand well trained Footmen, and twenty two thousand Horse, besides his Navy by Sea, which consisted of five hundred Gallyes, besides Ships of burden which carried his amunition, and Victuals.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Anthony,</hi> thus furnished, had presently passed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy,</hi> he had put <hi>Octavian</hi> into great hazard: For<note place="margin">

But <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> delaying the time at <hi>Athens,</hi> let slip the oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and gave <hi>Octavian</hi> leasure to provide all things

necessary from <hi>Italy, France, Spain,</hi> and all other his Provinces, from whence he levied eighty thousand choise Souldiers, and above twenty thousand good Horse: and seeing that <hi>Anthony</hi> stayed so long, he sent him word, that seeing he had Ships, and other fit provision, he should<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesars</hi> message.</note> come for <hi>Italy,</hi> where he staid in the Field to give him Battell, promising to afford him good Ports and Havens, where he might safely land without interruption.

            </p>
            <p>These Messages passing between them without effect, <hi>Anthony</hi> drew his Army by Land, and his Navy by Sea towards <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Octavian,</hi> imbarked his Legions at <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dusium,</hi>
               <note place="margin">They meet.</note> and crossed the Sea to a place called <hi>Torma,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Epire</hi> (now called <hi>Romania</hi>) and after some notable exploits performed, the two Armies drew neer together, as also did the Navies. <hi>Octavians</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy consisted of two hundred and fifty Galleys, but better armed, and swifter then were <hi>Mark Anthonies,</hi> though his were more in number.

            <p>
               <hi>Anthony</hi> chose twenty two thousand out of his Army<note place="margin">They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to fight.</note> and put them aboard his Fleet, and <hi>Octavian,</hi> who refused not the Sea-fight, made his provision also, and so ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping himself in his Galleys, he committed the charge of his Land Army to <hi>Taurus,</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> left his Land Forces with <hi>Canidius:</hi> and in the sight of both the Armies,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56425:41"/>
these two brave Captaines, which the best Navies in the World, took the Seas, where they fought for no lesse then the Empire of the World. Yet was the Fight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred for three dayes in dispite of both parties, the Seas rising so high that they could not Govern their Vessels. The fourth Day they came to an encounter at a Cape called <hi>Accius,</hi> in <hi>Epire,</hi> not far from the place where their Land Armies stood.</p>
            <p>The Battell was one of the most cruelest that ever was heard of, and lasted ten hours before <hi>Octavian</hi> obtained<note place="margin">A Battell.</note> the Victory, though <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> staid not so long in the fight. For <hi>Cleopatra</hi> in the greatest fury of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, fled away in her Galley, whom seventy of her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Galleys followed: and unfortunate <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> who all his life time hitherto had been a valiant and brave Captain, seeing <hi>Cleopatra</hi> fly, on whom he had fixed his<note place="margin">

            </p>

In <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonies</hi> Army by Land there wanted neither courage nor constancy to their Generall, though he had so unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily deserted them: and therefore they continued se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dayes in their Camp, ready to give Battell, without accepting any composition from the enemy, and they would have staid longer, had not <hi>Canidius</hi> their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

            <p>Then did <hi>Caesar</hi> sail to <hi>Athens,</hi> and being pacified with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> he distributed the Corne that was left in the War, to the Cities that were afflicted with Famine, and that were despoiled of their Money, Servants, and Horses, And <hi>Anthony</hi> being arrived in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> chose out one good Ship of good burden, and fraught with store of Treasure, and rich Plate of Gold and Silver, and gave it to his Friends, intreating them to divide it amongst them and to shift for themselves, and he wrote to <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them an hiding place till they might make their Peace with <hi>Caesar.</hi> And <hi>Caesar,</hi> of the spoiles of the enemy dedicated ten Ships' to <hi>Apollo Actius.</hi>

               <hi>Anthony</hi> being come into <hi>Africk</hi> went into a desart<note place="margin">

            <p>At <hi>Rome</hi> many things were decreed in honour of <hi>Caesar</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> highly honoured.</note> for this Victory at Sea: First a Triumph was granted him for <hi>Cleopatra:</hi> and a Triumphal Arch was erected at <hi>Brundusium,</hi> and another at <hi>Rome.</hi> The base of the <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Temple was adorned with the Beakes of the Shipshe had taken: There were Playes decreed to be kept every fifth year in honour of him: Processions were always to be made on his Birth day, and on the day wherein the newes of his Victory was first brought.

            </p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> sent Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to <hi>Caesar</hi> into <hi>Asia. Cleopatra</hi> demanded the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Aegypt</hi> for her Children, and without <hi>Anthonies</hi> knowledge, sent him a Scepter, Crown, and Chaire, all of Gold, as it were, delivering her Kingdom over to him: and <hi>Anthony</hi> demanded that he might live a private life at <hi>Athens</hi> if he might not continue in <hi>Aegypt.

               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:56425:43"/>
yet <hi>Caesar</hi> would give him no answer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> hereupon prepare for War, and <hi>Caesar</hi> at last marched against them, and sent <hi>Cornelius</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleopatra</hi> had storehouses, and Monuments, admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both for sumptuousnesse and higth, which she had built by the Temple of <hi>Isis,</hi> and thither she had brought the most precious things of all her Royall Treasure, as Gold, Silver, Emeralds, Pearles, Ebony, Ivory, and Cinnamon, as also store of Lamps, and Flax; whereupon <hi>Caesar</hi> fearing that she would set fire of them, whereby he should loose such Treasures, he, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven despaire, gave her hopes of favour, whilst he marched to wards the City, and she privately forbad the Citizens of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to sally out against him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as openly she seemed to encourage them to oppose him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> being come before the City, <hi>Anthony</hi> fallied out,<note place="margin">

               </note> and fought valiantly with him, and routed his Horse, and drave them to the very Camp, of which at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, he boasted to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and she to reward him gave him an Headpeice, &amp; Armour, all of Gold. The next Day <hi>Anthony</hi> dispersed tickets amongst <hi>Caesars</hi> Souldiers, promising them fifteen hundred Drachmaes a piece if thy would come over to him: These <hi>Caesar</hi> read to his Souldiers, rendering <hi>Anthony</hi> more hatefull to them thereby, and they being exceeding angry that their fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was tempted, fought so valiantly at the next encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that <hi>Anthony</hi> was driven back out of the Field. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56425:43"/>
this <hi>Anthony</hi> challenged <hi>Caesar</hi> to a single Duel, who answered, <hi>That</hi> Anthony <hi>had many wayes to die.</hi> He therefore considering that he could not die any way more honourably than in Battell, resolved to set upon <hi>Caesar</hi> both by Sea and Land.</p>
            <p>Many Prodigies fore-ran the bondage of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> In<note place="margin">Prodigies.</note> some places it rained bloud. Armies appeared in the Aier. A huge Draggon was seen amongst the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> which hissed horribly. A Comet appeared, and the Images of the Dead. The Statues seemed to mourne: and <hi>Apis</hi> lowing heavily, shed some teares.</p>
            <p>On the Kalends of <hi>August, Anthony</hi> early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cleopatras</hi> treachery.</note> went down to the Haven to order his Fleet. But <hi>Cleopatra</hi> caused them to revolt from him, and to joyn with <hi>Caesars</hi> Fleet: Whilst <hi>Anthony</hi> beheld this, he was also forsaken by all his Horsemen, who revolted to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> and his Foot were heaten back into the City: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he cryed out that he was betrayed by <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> She fearing his anger, fled to her Monument with one Eunuch, and two Maids, and sent <hi>Anthony</hi> word that she was dead: This he believing, desired his faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Erotes,</hi> according to his former promise, to kill him: <hi>Erotes</hi> drew out his Sword as if he would do it, but <hi>Anthonies</hi> back being towards him, he slew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who falling at his feet, <hi>Anthony</hi> said, <hi>Noble</hi> Erotes, <hi>thou hast taught me what to do, but couldst not endure to do it thy selfe;</hi> So taking the Sword, he thrust it into his Belly: yet after a while, the bloud stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <hi>Cleopatra</hi> from the top of the Monument perceiving it (for the Gate was so made that being shut it could not be again opened) she sent her Secretary to bring him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Monument to her: <hi>Anthony</hi> was carried to the foot of the Monument, and being tyed in a Pulley, was with great paines drawn up by <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and her two Maids. It was a sad sight to see him thus drawn up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smeared
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56425:44"/>
with bloud, and ready to give up the Ghost. When he came to the top, he stretched forth his hands to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who receiving him in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> laid him on a bed, tareing her head tire, breast and face with her own hands, so that she was all gore bloud: He laboured to comfort her, and advised her to look to her affaires, and to save her life if she could do it without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, and that amongst all <hi>Caesars</hi> Friends she should most trust <hi>Proculeius,</hi> and so gave up the Ghost.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Dercetaeus,</hi> one of <hi>Anthonies</hi> Guard, stole his bloudy Sword, and ran away with it to <hi>Caesar,</hi> telling him what had happened: <hi>Caesar</hi> then going into the inmost roome of his Tent, much bewailed <hi>Anthony,</hi>

Then sending for <hi>Proculeius,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him by all meanes, if it were possible, to save <hi>Cleopatra</hi> alive, fearing to loose her Treasures, and that she might adorne his Triumph. <hi>Procuieius,</hi> and one <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> coming to the Monument, laboured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade <hi>Cleopotra</hi> to come forth: and at last, by a wile, <hi>Proculeius</hi> seized upon her, yet granted her some dayes to embalme <hi>Anthonies</hi> Body, after which they brought her into the Pallace, diminishing nothing either of her wonted traine, or honour, that so she might do no mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to her self.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> having Conquered <hi>Alexandria;</hi> ascended into a Tribunal, and calling the Citizens before him, who for fear fel upon their knees, he told them that he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">

               </note> pardoned them for their great God <hi>Serapis</hi> his sake. He also pardoned the rest of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to put so many men to death, which formerly had done so good service for the <hi>Romans.</hi> Of those that favoured <hi>Anthony,</hi> some he put to death, and others he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned either of his own good will, or at the intercession of Friends. And whereas <hi>Anthony</hi> had with him many Children of Kings, some as Hostages, others upon
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56425:44"/>
false accusations, some of them <hi>Caesar</hi> sent home, others he joyned together in marriage, and some he kept by him. Comming to view the Tomb of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> (which as <hi>Strabo</hi> reporteth was of Glasse) <hi>Caesar</hi> put a Crown upon it, and strewed flowers over it, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped it: and being asked whether he would see the Bodies of the <hi>Ptolomies?</hi> he answered, <hi>That he would see a King, not the dead.</hi> Neither would he go to see their God <hi>Apis,</hi> saying, <hi>that he used to worship Gods, not Oxen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many great Kings, and Captains desired to bury the Body of <hi>Anthony,</hi> but <hi>Caesar</hi> would not take it from <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who buried it splendidly and Magnificent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and <hi>Caesar</hi> suffered her to take what Treasures she would for his Funerals. <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> through her much sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, fell into a Fever, and her Breast was troubled with inflammations, and ulcers, through the blowes which she had given herself, yet by the care of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and the skill of her Phisician she was recovered: after which she delivered to <hi>Caesar</hi> an Inventory of all her Treasures: and when <hi>Seleucus,</hi> one of her Treasures, accused her for concealing some things, she leaped up, and taking him by the haire, she buffetted him soundly; at which <hi>Caesar</hi> smiling, reproved her, to whom she answered, <hi>Is it not a great matter, O</hi> Caesar, <hi>seeing thou pleasest to come</hi>

               <hi>that by their intercessions I might find the more favour with thee, I hope its no fault. Caesar</hi> was glad at this, hoping that now she had a mind to live, but she deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.</p>
            <p>Shortly after she wrote a Letter, and sealing it up, she sent it by <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> to <hi>Caesar,</hi> wherein she desired to be buried with <hi>Anthony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> then adorning herself in her<note place="margin">She kills herself.</note> best apparel, she set an Aspe to her left Arme, by the biting of which, she presently died as in a slumber. As soon as <hi>Caesar</hi> had read her Letter, he sent some in all

hast to her to see what was done, who when they came, found <hi>Cleopatra</hi> dead upon a bed of Gold, in all her roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all robes, and her two waiting maides dead at her feet. <hi>Casar</hi> being informed hereof, admired, and pitied her, and grieved that he was deprived of the chiefe honour of his Triumph; and buried her in the same Sepulcher with <hi>Anthony,</hi> finishing the Tomb which she had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun: and her waiting Women by his command were buried honourably: she lived thirty nine years and raigned twenty two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> having setled his affairs in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> passed through <hi>Syria</hi> into <hi>Asia,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Greece,</hi> and so to <hi>Rome</hi> where he Triumphed three dayes, first<note place="margin">

After which <hi>Caesar</hi> inriched the Temple of his Father <hi>Julius</hi> with the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> spoiles: He also consecrated many things to <hi>Jupiter Capitolinus, Juno,</hi> and <hi>Minerva:</hi> He brought into the Cell of <hi>Jupiter Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolinus</hi> sixteen thousand pound weight of Gold, beside Pearls, and precious stones vallued at fifty Millions of Sesterces, and <hi>Rome</hi> was so enriched with the Riches of <hi>Alexandria</hi> that the prizes of every thing were doubled, and Interest fell from ten to four <hi>per Cent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Caesar,</hi> in the space of about sixteen years, erected the Monarchy, which his Uncle <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> had begun, and though the meanes whereby he obtained it, are not justifiable, yet afterwards he Governed it justly, and wisely, and was one of the best Princes in the World: Gentle, Just, Mercifull, Liberall, Valiant, and endued with many other Virtues; happy and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesfull<note place="margin">

            <p>The Senate also by Oath approved all his acts, freed him from all tye of Laws, and that he should have as<note place="margin">Flattery.</note> absolute power as the Laws, and that he might do all things, or not do them, according to his pleasure.

            <p>
               <hi>Caesar Augustus</hi> (for so now we must call him) seeing himself in quiet and without War, caused the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Janus</hi> to be shut, whereas they Religiously ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,<note place="margin">

and himself gave direction, and was very diligent in all things touching Justice, Customes, Religion, and publick buildings, so as in all things his Rign was happy, peaceable, and quiet dureing all his life.</p>
            <p>Yet in this so happy a time, some People and Nations still affecting Liberty, laboured to shake off the <hi>Roman</hi>
               <note place="margin">New troubles.</note> yoak, and thereby molested, and disquieted the Empire, as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the Inhabitants of <hi>Illyricum,</hi> and the <hi>Pannonians.</hi> In <hi>Spain</hi> the <hi>Cantabrians,</hi> the <hi>Astu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> and part of <hi>Gallicia,</hi> passing their bounds, began a War against the Empire. <hi>Augustus</hi> being informed hereof, judging it to be a doubtfull War, and of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, commanded the Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> to be opened, and determined to go against them in person, and to send other Captaines to follow his other Wars. And accordingly <hi>Augustus</hi> went into <hi>Spain,</hi> and with three Armies made War against the People aforementioned, which proved very doubtfull, and desperate, and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed five years: and though he suppressed the <hi>Cantabrians,</hi> and <hi>Asturians,</hi> and drave them to their Rocks and Moun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tains, yet before he could wholly subdue them, he was faign to bring a great Navy upon the coast of <hi>France</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Sea coasts of <hi>Cantabria,</hi> and <hi>Galizia,</hi> by which meanes he drave them to such extremities by Land, that they were at last forced to submit to his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustus</hi> his great favourite <hi>Agrippa</hi> served him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in this War, whom therefore he married to his Daughter <hi>Julia,</hi> who was the Widdow of his Nephew <hi>Marcellus,</hi> the Son of his Sister <hi>Octavia.</hi> And thus he brought all <hi>Spain</hi> into subjection to him above two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hundred<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>This long and doubtfull War being so happily finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Augustus</hi> was so pleased with it that he gave
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56425:46"/>
commandment that the Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> should again be shut, and came to <hi>Rome</hi> in great Triumph. But this Temple continued not long shut, for some Nations of the <hi>Germans</hi> rebelled, so that it was again opened. These were the Inhabitants of <hi>Noricum,</hi> (now <hi>Bavaria</hi>) and the <hi>Pannonia's</hi> (now <hi>Austria</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi>) and the two <hi>Missia's</hi> (now <hi>Bulgary,</hi> and <hi>Servia</hi>)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as also <hi>Illyricum</hi> (now <hi>Sclavonia</hi>) and the Province of <hi>Dacia</hi> (now <hi>Transylvania,</hi> and <hi>Walachia</hi>) and some others, though at severall times.</p>
            <p>Against these <hi>Augustus</hi> sent his Generals, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, amongst which were his Sons in Law, the Sons of <hi>Livia, Tiberius Nero,</hi> who succeeded him in the Empire, and his Brother <hi>Drusus Nero,</hi> of whom <hi>Livia</hi> was with child when <hi>Octavian</hi> married her: and these two Brothers (though the War lasted somewhat long) vanquished those Nations, and obtained great Victories in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the confines thereof: especially <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> who in three years space subdued the <hi>Pannonia's, Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyricum,</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia;</hi> for which Victories he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards entered into <hi>Rome</hi> in an Ovation Triumph with great Pomp and honour. <hi>Marcus Crassus</hi> also over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came and put to flight the <hi>Missians,</hi> a People who had never seen the <hi>Romans</hi> before. And when they were ready to give Battell, they said, <hi>Tell us who you are that seek to molest, and disquiet us?</hi> We are (said they) <hi>Romans,</hi> the Lords of Nations, whereupon they replyed, <hi>It shall be so if you overcome us;</hi> which fell out accordingly.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Augustus</hi> obtained not these Victories without<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Augustus</hi> his crosses.</note> some crosses. For in these Wars dyed his Son in Law <hi>Drusus,</hi> who was highly esteemed for his Noble acts, and grear Victories, for the losse of whom both <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> and <hi>Livia</hi> were much afflicted: But yet his griefe was greater for the mishap which befell <hi>Quintilius Varro,</hi> who was Generall of three Legions in <hi>Germany,</hi> and being carelesse, was surprized by the <hi>Almans,</hi> and himself, his Legions, and all his Auxiliaries were slaine, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56425:47"/>
two Standards with the Emperiall Eagles taken, for which he was so immoderately grieved, that he knocked his Head against the Wall, and cryed out unadvisedly, <hi>Quintilius Varro, Give me my Legions again:</hi> For certaine moneths also he suffered the haire of his Head and Beard to grow carlesly. And the very day of this unhappy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, he did every year observe mournfully with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and lamentation.</p>
            <p>Of his Son in Law <hi>Drusus</hi> there remained two Sons, <hi>Germanicus</hi> and <hi>Claudius,</hi> which he had by <hi>Antonia, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> his Neece, and Daughter of his Sister <hi>Octavia</hi> and <hi>Mark Anthony;</hi> of which <hi>Claudius</hi> was Emperour: And <hi>Germanicus</hi> married <hi>Agrippina,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Julia, Augustus</hi> his Daughter, by whom he had <hi>Caius Caligula,</hi> who also was afterwards Emperour. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi> after many notable Victories, compelled his enemies at length to sue for Peace, whereupon again he commanded the Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> to be shut up, and from thenceforth all things succeeded prosperonsly with him.</p>
            <p>The Subjects of the Empire were now very obedient to him, and all other sent their Ambassadours seeking his<note place="margin">Many Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours come to him.</note> favour, and Friendship. The <hi>Indians</hi> in the remotest parts of the East; and the <hi>Scythians</hi> that inhabited the North: and the <hi>Parthians</hi> an untamed People, sent their Ambassadours to him, giving security to keep the Peace, and restoring to him the Standards and Eagles which were taken when <hi>Marcus Crassus</hi> was slaine. There came also Kings who were Friends and Subjects to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to do him Homage, laying aside their Ensignes, and Royall Robes: and many of them built Cities to his Name, and for his honour, calling them <hi>Caesaria.</hi> So did <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> in <hi>Palestine:</hi> King <hi>Juba</hi> in <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>The World being thus at Peace and quietnesse, forty and two years being expired since that <hi>Augustus,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Death of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time of this generall Peace, was the Prince of Peace, our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

Lord and Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> borne in <hi>Bethlem,</hi> of<note place="margin">Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>Christ</hi> borne.</note> the Virgin <hi>Mary, Herod</hi> being King of <hi>Judaea,</hi> placed there by the <hi>Romans,</hi> of whose blessed Life and bitter Death, as also of the order of his Ministery, and Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles see his Life published by me <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1664. At which time their came forth a command from <hi>Caesar Augustus</hi> that all the <hi>Roman</hi> World should be tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which taxing was first made when <hi>Cyrenius</hi> was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Syria. Luck.</hi> 2. 1. Out of which a little Book was made by <hi>Augustus,</hi> in which all the publick Riches were contained: as also how many Citizens, and Allies in Armes: what Navies: How many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Provinces: what Tribute, and Customs there were: what necessary charges, and Pensions went out. Shortly after <hi>Augustus</hi> was called Lord by the People, but he did not only refuse that Title, but forbad it by a publick Edict.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustus</hi> enjoying so great prosperity, was yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<note place="margin">His Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Justice.</note> altered in his qualities and behaviour, as often it happens in other Princes; but rather became more mild, just, and affable, more courteous, liberall, and temperate. He established very good Laws, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for the reformation of abuses and evill customes. He erected both within and without <hi>Rome</hi> many stately, and sumptuous Edifices, which made him to boast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Rome, Latericiam inveni, Marmoream reliqui:</hi> I found it built with Brick, and left it built with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. He bestowed great gifts and favours upon all sorts of People. He delighted the People with Feasts, and Playes of sundry kinds, going himself in person to honour them: He sent Colonies into sundry parts and Provinces: He made excellent good Orders for the Governours, and Government of the whole Empire: The like he did also for the Wars, and Martial Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. He shewed himself loving and sociable to his Friends and Familiars, whom he honoured and loved much. Some conspiracies against him which were disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, he punished without rigour, being more prone to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56425:48"/>
pardon than to punish. Of murmurings, and defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Libels he never desired to know the Authours; but answered them with gravity, giving satisfaction, and purging himself from those things which were charged upon him. He was much addicted to, and affected with learning, and himself was very learned and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and compiled some notable Books. He much honoured and rewarded wise and learned men: yet he escaped not the tainture of some vices, growing through humaine frailty, and his great liberty: especially he was much given to Women, though in his diet, apparel,<note place="margin">His vices.</note> and ornaments he was very sparing and modest. He gave himself also excessively to play at Dice, and other Games then in use.</p>
            <p>Thus, though in many things he was very happy, yet, besides his troubles and dangers, he was very unhappy in his Children and Successours: For by his<note place="margin">His cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> four Wives to whom he was married, he had only one Daughter called <hi>Julia,</hi> by his third Wife <hi>Scribonia,</hi> and she proved exceeding Wanton, and unchast, yea she left nothing undone in luxury, and lust, which was possible for a woman to do or suffer, accounting every thing lawfull that pleased her. Yea, she came to that heigth of laciviousnesse, that she kept her feasting even in the Courts of Justice, abusing those very places with lascivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous acts in which her Father had made Laws against A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers. Hereupon her Father was so enraged that he could not contain his anger within his own House, but published these things, yea, and communicated them to the Lords of the Senate. He kept himself also a long time from company for very shame: He had thoughts of putting his Daughter to death; but at last he banished her into <hi>Pandataria,</hi> an Island of <hi>Campania,</hi> her Mother <hi>Scribonia,</hi> of her own accord, accompanying her in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, <hi>Julia</hi> being at this time thirty eight years old.</p>
            <p>For want of Sons to succed him, <hi>Augustus</hi> first adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Nephew <hi>Marcellus</hi> the Son of his Sister <hi>Octavia,</hi> to whom he first married his Daughter <hi>Julia:</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:56425:48"/>
dying without issue, he then married her to his Favourite <hi>Agrippa:</hi> who also left her a Widdow, but yet he had by her three Sons, and two Daughters: Two of these Sons having been adopted by <hi>Augustus,</hi> died before him: whereupon he adopted the third, who bore his Fathers Name, <hi>Agrippa,</hi> the which adoption he afterwads revoaked for some displeasure conceived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him: and lastly he adopted his Son in Law <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Nero,</hi> and made him his Heire, whom also he married to his Daughter <hi>Julia,</hi> the Widdow of <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa:</hi> yet this he did more through the importunity of his mother, than for any good liking that he had of him, being sorry that such an one should succeed him.</p>
            <p>Not long after, the first Letter of his Name that was upon the Inscription of his Statue that was set up in the Capitol, fell down, being struck with a flash of lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; whereupon the Southsayers foretold that he should<note place="margin">A prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</note> live only one hundred dayes after, which was denoted by the letter <hi>C.</hi> and that he should be Cannonized for a God, because <hi>Aesar,</hi> which remained of his Name, in the <hi>Hetruscan.</hi> Tongue signified a God. Hereupon he wrot a Catalogue of his doings, which he appointed to be engraven in Tables of Brasse, and to be set over his Tomb.</p>
            <p>Things being thus done, <hi>Caesar Augustus</hi> being now se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty six years old, and odd dayes, having raigned above fifty six, and being the best beloved, and the best obeyed Prince in the World, Death overtook him, which was occasioned by a flux which held him for some dayes: and so <hi>Augustus</hi> died at <hi>Nolla</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> in the same House and Chamber wherein his Father <hi>Octavius</hi> died,<note place="margin">His Death.</note> being the nineteenth day of <hi>August,</hi> upon which day he was first made Consul: and in the fifteenth year after the birth of our Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was generally lamented, and there was a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall sorrow, and heavinesse over the whole Empire for him. For he did wisely and uprightly Govern that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy

which he had gotten by force, and fraud. He was<note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> of a mean stature, of a very good shape, and proportion of Body, of an exceeding fair face mixed with modesty, and gravity: His eyes were very clear and bright: He was very advised in his speeches, and loved to speak quick, and briefly. His last Will and Testament was written a year and four moneths before he died, and left in the custody of the <hi>Vestall Virgins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his life time he was very desirous to reforme abuses in <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the first place he corrected some disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Senate, whom he reduced to the number of six hundred. He reformed what was amiss in their playes and Games, in the Knights, and in their manner of suing for publick Offices. He set fines upon their Heads that would not marry, and bestowed much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those that had Wives and Children. He gave unto <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensius</hi>
               <note place="margin">He was a friend to marriag.</note> twenty five thousand Crowns to procure him to marry, that he might raise up issue to that Noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Hortenses.</hi> He ordained that maids should be at least twelve years old before they married: and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to kill Adulterers that were taken in the fact, and condemned the <hi>Sodomites</hi> without pardon. He gave order that none should be put in nomination for Offices but such as were vertuous and of good repute. He tied not himself to any certain hours for his meales, but used to eat when he was hungry, and that which he fed upon was neither dainty nor delicate, and he drank<note place="margin">His tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.</note> little Wine: Instead of a Looking-glasse, he used to read or write whilst his Barber was trimming him. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver spake to the Senate or people, or to his Souldiers but what he had first written and premeditated, though he had words at command.</p>
            <p>He delighted to read good Authours, but gathered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then sentences teaching good manners, and<note place="margin">His Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> having written them out word for word, he gave Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies thereof to his familiar Friends, and sent them about to the Governours of Provinces and to the Magistrates of <hi>Rome.</hi> He was too much adicted to Divinations,

and was marvellously afraid of Thunder and Lightning: Our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> being borne, all the Devils Oracles ceased, and the Oracle of <hi>Delphes</hi> was faigne to confesse it, and ever after remained dumb: whereupon <hi>Augustus</hi>
