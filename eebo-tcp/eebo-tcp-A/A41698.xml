            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <salute>My Lord,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all Ages the greatest and wisest of Mankind have been the <hi>Patrons of Poesie</hi>; They have taken the Authors into their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:55172:3"/>
and their Works into their <hi>Bosoms,</hi> and both in the one and the other have not fail'd of an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and, oft, a <hi>Divine Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> But neither of these is to be expected from <hi>Me,</hi> or my <hi>Writings:</hi> These <hi>Poets</hi> might pretend their Merit to the Favour and Protection of their <hi>Patrons</hi>; Whereas, I must consider your Lordship's Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension to me meerly as an effect of your Goodness, which, because it would have me do well, gave me Encouragement, though to do well was not really in my Power: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, when <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> were my Subjects, I never fail'd to exert my <hi>Endeavours.</hi> You found me, my Lord, an <hi>Orphan,</hi> without For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or Friends, and have rais'd me
<pb facs="tcp:55172:3"/>
to both; I have had the smiles of many Persons, because they knew I had your Lordship's; Your <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation</hi> was the <hi>Stamp</hi> that made me pass almost <hi>Vnquestion'd,</hi> though, at the same time, you knew, or at least I was conscious to my self, the Metal was not right <hi>Sterling.</hi> Nor has your Lordship only rais'd me, and left me there, but setled upon me such a competence as has fixt my Ambition. Showing the World you are of the same mind of <hi>Timon</hi> in <hi>Shakespear,</hi>
                     <q>'Tis not enough to help the feeble up, But to support him after.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I am not the only proof, by many, of your Lordship's Bounty;
<pb facs="tcp:55172:4"/>
'tis of a more diffusive Nature than to be so narrowly confin'd: No Man that ever had the Honour of being a <hi>Retainer</hi> to your Lordship, but has known it in a high degree; To be admitted your <hi>Menial</hi> is, in effect, a Maintainance for Life: And what may the good Servant expect when even the bad (such as my self) meet with Rewards so unpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd to any Merit they can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by their Service? Neither are these Showres of Liberality rain'd only on your <hi>Domesticks</hi>; Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as well as they, have their share. The Widow, the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and the Poor, are the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Objects of your Charity; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid'st affairs of the highest moment (in which y'are now employ'd) you
<pb facs="tcp:55172:4"/>
have a thought that stoops to the Relief of the Wretched. Our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Herbert</hi> tells us,
<q>— All <hi>worldly Goods</hi> are less Than that <hi>one good</hi> of doing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a Principle you live up to in all its Latitude; for, certainly, your Lordship may pass under this general Character, that never any Man was known to you but to his Advantage. The Oath <hi>Pindar</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins his <hi>Muse</hi> (in Praise of <hi>Theron</hi> Prince of <hi>Agrigentum</hi>) might with equal Justice be said of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:

This is a kind of Confession that wou'd have grated some Men to have publish't, but 'tis Truth, and that takes away a little from the reproach on't, though I hope 'twill be thought none, since the avoidless Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I have been in deny'd me all access to the bettering my self by Letters, the necessary and daily Provision for an honest subsistence taking up my Time; and no Man can be Disposer of his Fate, a supreme hand governs. Notwithstanding, I must declare I found admittance into the best and most refin'd Conversation; But Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, 'tis allow'd, is not able to make a <hi>Poet,</hi> though, indeed, it may improve him: There shou'd be a Foundation laid in the <hi>University,</hi> which also shou'd be mellow'd and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht

by Travel and Correspondence, for that gives us a clearer Inspection into Men, and their variety of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions; without this, to speak plain, there will appear some of the <hi>Rust of the College</hi> in a Man's Manners and Intellect: A Man of <hi>general Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> is not to be made so there; meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a <hi>Divine</hi> it may do indifferent well, yet 'twere better they knew the World more, without which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not truly teach us to despise it.

born a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> unless his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation illustrate his Extraction, is more contemptible than the vilest Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant: so a <hi>Poet,</hi> though so by <hi>Nature,</hi> will prove himself to be little better, unless <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> are ready at hand, to give the last <hi>touch</hi> and <hi>gracefulness</hi> to his <hi>Writings,</hi> and make that a <hi>finisht Piece,</hi> which before was but a <hi>Sketch,</hi> or <hi>Rough-Draught</hi> of the <hi>Fancy.</hi> A Man must have an equal Portion of both, though of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>Species</hi> they must be made one <hi>Individual,</hi> like the <hi>Hermaphrodite</hi> in <hi>Ovid,</hi> without which nothing can be produced that will bear the <hi>Test of Ages.</hi>

what is amiss, I will never give him any fresh Occasion for that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; for here I renew my Promise (made to <hi>two great Men</hi>) of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up all my Engagements to that Study, together, if the <hi>Criticks</hi> please, with the very Name of a <hi>Poet,</hi> which I confess I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve; Resolving seriously never more to write a line, unless in command to those I dare not disobey; though ev'n there I am so far secur'd, that no man of sense will think it worth the while to lay such an Injunction upon me, and I pay no observance to Fools.

                        <l>Hail then, blest Pair! your Race of Love's begun,</l>
                        <l>And may you still be eager to love on;</l>

                        <l>As thus I spoke, <hi>Aurora</hi>'s cheerful ray</l>
                        <l>Brought the glad Tydings of returning day,</l>
                        <l>The <hi>Larks</hi> did mount, their morning <hi>Carols</hi> sung,</l>
                        <l>To Heav'ns wide Arch the tuneful Echo's rung:</l>
                        <l>And now the <hi>Sun</hi> let loose the Reins of light,</l>
                        <l>And ne're before, methought, appear'd so bright;</l>
                        <l>No gloomy Cloud did interpose between</l>
                        <l>His Beams and us, nor rising Fog was seen:</l>
                        <l>The Winds were hush't; only a balmy breeze,</l>
                        <l>With am'rous Wings, fann'd perfume through the Trees.</l>
                        <l>Lo! here, cry'd I again, when all around,</l>
                        <l>Above, below, a general Joy I found,</l>
                        <l>Nature her self, to shew we well admire,</l>
                        <l>Puts on her gorgeous Robes and Spring attire,</l>

                        <l>Never, O Grateful Goddess! was it known</l>
                        <l>Thy Glories were more proper to be shown.</l>
                        <l>For, O! what Charms can in that <hi>Sex</hi> abound</l>
                        <l>That's not in the more charming <hi>Adorissa</hi> found?</l>

                        <l>A temper, which no trifling will abide,</l>
                        <l>Sweet without Art, and stately without Pride;</l>
                        <l>How all she does becomes her, such a Grace!</l>
                        <l>Such lovely Motions! such a lovely Face!</l>
                        <l>Though young her self, yet how in Judgment old,</l>

                        <l>And I shou'd err to keep you longer here.</l>

                        <l>With equal Harmony your Measures meet;</l>
                        <l>And you, fair Dam'sels, give delight the rein,</l>

                        <l>O give not <hi>Cupid</hi> all, let <hi>Bacchus</hi> have his share.</l>
                        <l>So, to the top fill up the flowing Bowl,</l>

                        <l>OF <hi>Poets</hi> living poorly oft you tell,</l>
                        <l>But you may wonder how they live so well:</l>

                        <l>Not that the <hi>Poets</hi> have so vast a store,</l>
                        <l>But they might, very well, dispence with more:</l>
                        <l>Of late, indeed, what e're they want in sense,</l>
                        <l>Is made up with <hi>Poetick Impudence</hi>;</l>
                        <l>No Trophies to the good or great they raise,</l>
                        <l>But <hi>Fool</hi> and <hi>Knave</hi> they over-whelm with praise.</l>
                        <l>They feed on Flattry, and it keeps 'em strong;</l>

                        <p>FOR the Reader's clearer understanding, I am to inform him, that the word [<hi>Beaux-Esprits</hi>] as here us'd, has no relation to the <hi>Beaux-Esprits,</hi> or <hi>Vertuosi</hi> of <hi>France</hi>; but means barely what the word in that Language imports in its simple signification; which is, fine, good, or <hi>true Wits:</hi> The <hi>Poem</hi> being written to a <hi>Society</hi> of Ingenious Gentlemen, whom the World has honour'd with that <hi>Distinction.</hi> Not but they might, without Arrogance, have assum'd to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that <hi>Title,</hi> as being Men whose charming Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations have render'd 'em the delight and Ornament of the Age; it being thought no small Honour, ev'n by the most Accomplish't, to be admitted of their <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi> What more relates to 'em follows in the <hi>Poem;</hi> which, though it does not particularize their Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, may serve to let the World see how sublime a piece a better hand wou'd have made upon the subject. But for my Insufficiency, I beg their Pardon: this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my first Essay in <hi>Pindarick,</hi> and likely to be the last; since nothing that can, or, at least, has of late been writ in this kind, is comparable to what that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable <hi>Poet</hi> has done, who first retriev'd and made this stately way of writing familiar to us; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed has perform'd so much, as cuts off all hope of like success to any that now do, or shall (I prophesie)
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55172:69"/>
hereafter attempt it: for though he has imitated <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar</hi> without the danger that <hi>Horace</hi> presag'd shou'd befal the Man shou'd dare to do it: 'tis vain for us (without the same portion of Genius) to mount that unruly Steed, whose guidance requir'd ev'n all the strength and skill of so great and so celebrated an Author.</p>

                        <l>
                           <hi>Cromwell</hi> had much to say in his defence;</l>
                        <l>Who, though a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> which all ills comprize,</l>
                        <l>Has been extoll'd and lifted to the Skies:</l>
                        <l>While living (such was the applause they gave)</l>
                        <l>Counted High, Princely, Pious, Just and Brave,</l>
                        <l>And with <hi>Encomiums</hi> waited to the Grave.</l>

                        <l>Which, rightly understood, does but debase,</l>

                        </l>

                        <l>They are condemn'd and scorn'd by <hi>men of wit:</hi>
                        </l>

                        <l>Though most to that stupidity are grown,</l>
                        <l>They wave their <hi>Patron</hi>'s praise to write their <hi>own</hi>;</l>

                        <l>In short, nought helps like <hi>Satyr</hi> to amend:</l>
                        <l>While in huge Volumes motly <hi>Priests</hi> contend,</l>
                        <l>And let their vain Disputes ne'r have an end,</l>
                        <l>They plunge us in those Snares we else shou'd shun;</l>
                        <l>Like <hi>Tinkers,</hi> make <hi>ten holes</hi> in mending <hi>one.</hi>

                        <l>Loosely run on in the vain Paths we did:</l>
                        <l>'Tis <hi>Satyr,</hi> then, that is our truest Friend,</l>
                        <l>For none before they know their Faults can mend;</l>
                        <l>That tells us boldly of our foulest crimes,</l>
                        <l>Reproves ill manners, and reforms the Times:</l>
                        <l>How am I then too blame, when all I write</l>
                        <l>Is honest rage, not prejudice, or spight?</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Truth</hi> is my aim, with <hi>truth</hi> I shall impeach,</l>
                        <l>And I'll spare none that come within it's reach:</l>

                  <l>The Rich, indeed, might daily Presents bring,</l>

                  <p>THE pious Endeavours of the <hi>Gown</hi> have not prov'd more ineffectual towards reclaiming the Errors of a vitious Age, than <hi>Satyr</hi> (the better way, though less practised) the amendment of Honesty and good Manners among us: Nor is it a wonder, when we consider that <hi>Women</hi> (as if they had the Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of <hi>Fallen-Angel</hi> in their Composition) the more they are lash't, are but the more hardned in Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: And as Children, in some violent Distemper, commonly spit out those cherishing Cordials, which, if taken, might chase away the Malady, so they (inspir'd, as 'twere, with a natural averseness to Vertue) despise that wholsome counsel, which is religiously design'd for their future good and happiness. Iudge, then, if <hi>Satyr</hi> ever had more need of a sharper sting than now, when he can look out of his <hi>Cell</hi> on no side, but sees so many Objects beyond the reach of Indignation. Nor is it altogether unreasonable for me (while others are lashing the Rebellious times into obedience) to have one fling at <hi>Woman,</hi> the original of Mischief. I am sensible, I might as well expect to see Truth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty uppermost in the World, as think to be free from the bitterness of their Resentments; But I have no reason to be concern'd at that; since, I'm certain, my design's as far from offending the good (if there are
<pb facs="tcp:55172:89"/>
any among them that can be said to be so) as those few that are good wou'd be offended at their Reception into Bliss, to be there crown'd with the happy reward of their Labours. As for those that are ill, if it gall them, it succeeds according to my wish; for I have no other design but the amendment of Vice, which if I cou'd but, in the least, accomplish, I shou'd be well pleas'd, and not without reason too; for it must needs be some satisfaction to a young, unskilful <hi>Archer,</hi> to <hi>hit</hi> the first <hi>mark</hi> he ever aim'd at.</p>

                  <p>THE best Excuse the <hi>Author</hi> of a <hi>Dedication</hi> can make his Patron, is, in my Iudgment, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure him he shall not be troubled with his future Impertinence. I have oft presum'd upon your Lordship's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and can no otherwise make amends
<pb facs="tcp:55172:114"/>
than by protesting this is the last time I shall offend you in this Nature. <hi>Poetry</hi> has hitherto been my <hi>Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>; I must take care it does not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon my <hi>better Judgment,</hi> and oblige me to make it my <hi>business:</hi> in order to it, I here take a solemn and lasting leave of it: Your Lordship has set the Example. In your Youth <hi>Poesie,</hi> sometimes, snatch't a moment or two from your other <hi>Diversions,</hi> and never, indeed, did so small time produce so lovely an <hi>Issue</hi>; Whatever you writ was full of that <hi>Fancy, Wit</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> which made, and does yet make your <hi>Conversation,</hi> of all things, most desirable and charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but now grown to an age mature, more solid and sublime things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>Favorites</hi> of your choice and
<pb facs="tcp:55172:114"/>
study. <hi>Poetry</hi> shou'd never be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd in a Man's Bosome, she may sometimes be admitted to make a Visit and away; her constant converse is vain and trivial: What <hi>Cowley</hi> says upon another occasion, I cou'd, methinks naturally adapt to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thoughts of <hi>Poetry</hi>;
<q>
                        <l>My Eyes are open'd and I see</l>
                        <l>Through the <hi>transparent Fallacy.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed, my Lord, to be always versifying, is to be always wasting the most pretious Gift of Heav'n, our Time, without so much as the pretence of Gain for an Excuse: But say that a Man were worthy of praise, and that his Writings really deserv'd it; yet that <hi>Chamelion diet</hi> is a little too
<pb facs="tcp:55172:115"/>

                     <hi>I</hi> Have endeavour'd in this <hi>Poem</hi> to write as bold Truths as I cou'd, and, I hope, without offence to <hi>good Manners</hi>; Though some may imagine I have swerv'd from it in the <hi>Characters</hi> at the latter end of the <hi>Satyr:</hi> But I wou'd have the <hi>Critick</hi> know, that if there are really such Persons as be there describ'd, they ought to have the Reprehension there given: for where Folly and Knavery are so visible, I will be so much a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller as to believe there ought to be no Respect of Persons. Twou'd be very unhappy for Rich Men, and a priviledge, I think, they ought not to boast of, if their <hi>Birth,</hi> or <hi>Wealth,</hi> shou'd exempt 'em from being told of their Errours. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever no Mans Reputation is injur'd; for, as I have said in the <hi>Satyr,</hi> (which to Iudicious Men will justify the honesty of my Intention.)

                     <l>THat Man, my Friend, does tempt a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g'rous Fate,</l>
                     <l>That lists himself into a <hi>Marriage State.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Where is that <hi>He</hi> so happy in a Bride,</l>
                     <l>But oft does wish the <hi>fatal Knot</hi> unty'd?</l>
                     <l>Qualms of Disquiet will oppress his thought,</l>
                     <l>And make him see his <hi>Marriage</hi> was a fau't.</l>
                     <l>And if the happy find so bad success,</l>
                     <l>They that have <hi>ill Wives,</hi> sure, must hope for less.</l>

                     <l>Put a long stop to all their best Delights:</l>
                     <l>And then with Grief they find (what greater ill?)</l>
                     <l>They're wretched, and are sure to be so still.</l>
                     <l>But 'twill be urg'd; if 'tis a Snare so great,</l>
                     <l>What makes Men add Wings to their own ill Fate?</l>
                     <l>And strive to meet misfortunes with such hast,</l>
                     <l>Which of themselves, alas! come on too fast?</l>
                     <l>But ah! set human frailty in your Eyes,</l>

                     <l>Or grant we cou'd, this Sea has unseen Shelves,</l>

                     <l>And therefore I that Maxim disapprove,</l>
                     <l>That those that join here, first, are join'd above.</l>

                     <l>I know 'tis cruel to remind you' again</l>
                     <l>Of wrongs y'ave suffer'd, and add pain to pain;</l>
                     <l>But, if you will a while your thoughts suspend,</l>

                     <l>You marry'd her, and there your Woes began,</l>
                     <l>'Twas your hard chance to be that hapless Man:</l>

                     <l>There were few Men but thought you doubly blest.</l>
                     <l>You lov'd her above thought, above controul,</l>
                     <l>Sooner than wrong her, you'd ha' wrong'd your Soul:</l>
                     <l>And yet (so far her cunning did excel)</l>
                     <l>It was believ'd that she lov'd you as well.</l>

                     <l>That seems so good, and is, indeed, so ill?</l>
                     <l>For soon she threw off Vertues, forc'd disguise,</l>
                     <l>With which, a while, she strove t' amuse your Eyes;</l>
                     <l>And then, to shew which way she lean'd before,</l>

                     </l>
                     <l>Her roving thoughts were bounded by no Law,</l>
