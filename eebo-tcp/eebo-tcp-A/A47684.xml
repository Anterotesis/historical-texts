            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And whereas upon severall Examinations taken the seventh day of this instant <hi>Ianuary,</hi> before the Committee appointed by the House of Commons, to sit in <hi>London,</hi> it did fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that many Souldiers, Papists, and others, to the number of about 500. came with His Majesty on Tuesday last, to the said House of Commons, armed with Swords, Pistolls, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Weapons; and divers of them pressed to the door of the said House, thrust away the door Keepers, and placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, between the said door, and the ordinary attendants of His Majesty; holding up their Swords, and some holding up their Pistolls ready cocked neer the said door; and saying, I am a good Marksman, I can hit right I warrant you, and they not suffering the said door, according to the custom of Parliament to be shut, but said they would have the door open, and if any opposition were against them, they made no question, but they should make their party good, and that they would maintain their party; and when severall Members of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were coming into the House, their attendants desiring that Room might be made for them, some of the said Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers answered, A Pox of God confound them, and others said, A Pox take the house of Commons, let them come and be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, what a do is here with the House of Commons; and some of the said Souldiers did likewise violently assault, and by force disarme some of the Attendants, and servants of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the House of Commons, waiting in the Room next the said House, and upon the Kings return out of the said House, many of them by wicked oaths, and otherwise, expressed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102910:8"/>
much discontent, that some Members of the said House, for whom they came were not there; and others of them said, when comes the word, and no word being given at His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties coming out, they cryed a lane, a lane; afterwards some of them being demanded, what they thought the said compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny intended to have done, answered, That questionlesse in the posture they were set, if the word had been given, they should have fallen upon the House of Commons, and have cut all their throats. Vpon all which we are of opinion, that it is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved, that the coming of the said Souldiers, Papists, and others with His Majesty to the House of Commons on Tuesday last, being the fourth of this instant <hi>Ianuary,</hi> in the manner aforesaid, was to take away some of the Members of the said House; and if they should have found opposition, or deniall, then to have fallen upon the said House in a hostile manner. And we doe hereby declare that the same was a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous designe against the King and Parliament. And whereas the said M <hi>Hollis,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Haslerigg,</hi> M. <hi>Pym,</hi> M. <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and M. <hi>Strode,</hi> upon report of the coming of the said Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, Papists, &amp; others in the warlike and hostile manner, afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, did with the approbation of the House absent themselves from the service of the House, for avoiding the great, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inconveniences, which otherwise apparantly might have hapned: Since which time a printed paper in the form of a Proclamation, bearing date the sixth day of this instant <hi>Ianuary,</hi> hath issued out for the apprehending, and imprisoning of them, Therein suggesting that through the conscience of their own guilt, they were absent and fled, not willing to submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to Iustice; We doe farther declare that the said printed paper is false, scandalous and illegall, and that notwithstanding the said printed paper, or any warrant issued out, or any other matter yet appearing against them, or any of them, they may and ought to attend the service of the said House of Commons, and the severall Committees now on foot. And that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for all persons whatsoever to lodge, harbour or converse
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102910:8"/>
with them, or any of them; And whosoever shall be questioned for the same, shall be under the Protection and Priviledge of Parliament.</p>
            <p>And we doe further declare, That the publishing of severall Articles purporting a form of a charge of high Treason against the Lord <hi>Kimbolton,</hi> one of the Members of the Lords House, and against the said, M. <hi>Hollis,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Haslerigg,</hi> M. <hi>Pym,</hi> M. <hi>Hampden,</hi> and M. <hi>Strode,</hi> by Sir <hi>William Killigrew,</hi> Sir <hi>William Flemen,</hi> and others in the Innes of Court, and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in the Kings Name, was a high Breach of the Priviledge of Parliament, a great scandall to His Maiesty, and His Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: A seditious Act manifestly tending to the subversion of the Peace of the Kingdome, and an injury, and dishonour to the said Members, there being no legall charge or accusation against them.</p>
            <p>That the Priviledges of Parliament, and the Liberties of the Subject so violated and broken, cannot be fully and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently Vindicated, unlesse His Majesty will be gratiously plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to discover the names of those Persons, who advised His Majesty to issue out Warrants, for the sealing of the Chambers, and Studies of the said Members, to send a Serjeant at Arms to the House of Commons, to demand their said Members, to is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue out severall Warrants under His Majesties own hand, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the said Members. His Majesties coming thither, in His own Royall Person. The publishing of the said Articles, and printed paper in the form of a Proclamation against the said Members in such manner as is before declared; To the end that such Persons may receive condigne punishment.</p>
            <p>And this House doth further declare, That all such persons as have given any Councell, or endeavoured to set or maintain division or dislike, between the King and Parliament, or have Listed their names, or otherwise entred into any combination or agreement, to beayding or assisting to any such councell or endeavour, or have perswaded any other so to doe, or that shall doe any the things above mentioned, And shall not forthwith
