         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
Quaere concerning the
Church-Covenant, practiſed
IN THE
SEPARATE CONGREGATION</head>
            <argument>
               <p>By what warrant of Scripture or otherwiſe, can any Church of Chriſt impoſe any
ſuch expreſſe and formall covenant upon thoſe that deſire memberſhip with
them, as a peremptory condition of their admittance, as is now generally pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
in all your Churches; We conceive the Scripture no where juſtifieth
theſe proceedings, but rather judge there is much evill, and manifold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
in the exacting and urging ſuch a covenant.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <label>FIRST,</label>
            </p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onfident we are (as confidence it ſelfe can make us)
that there is no Commandement given to the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
for exacting any ſuch Covenant of thoſe that are to
bee admitted into Church-fellowſhip with them, ſo
that we conceive any ſuch exaction to bee a meere
humane invention, and a ſtraine of that wiſedome that
deſires not only to exalt it ſelfe above all that is practiſed by men, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
that which is written by God himſelfe; yea, though inſtances &amp;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95015:3"/>
examples could be produced of ſuch Covenants both demanded and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
yet this may ſtand without any warrant of lawfulneſſe, much
more without the impoſition of any neceſſity upon Churches at this
day to make the like demand of their intended members; and moſt of
all it may ſtand without any neceſſity lying upon Churches, to make
the demand as of a duty of abſolute neceſſitie.</p>
            <p>Firſt, no example bindeth but by vertue, and in the ſtrength of ſome
commandement, &amp; if there were any thing neceſſary to be done which
is not commanded by God, then muſt there be found weakeneſſe &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
in his Law; therefore to make any thing neceſſary which
the Law of God maketh not neceſſary, <hi>is not to keepe the Law, but (as James</hi>
ſaith) <hi>to judge it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, there be examples found of many things done by many
Chriſtians (yea by whole Churches) in the primitive times, not onely
lawfully but with high and ſpeciall approbation, the doing whereof
in theſe times is not onely no wayes neceſſary, but lyable to much
queſtion, whether lawfull or convenient. The ſelling of lands and
houſes, by thoſe that were the poſſeſſors of them, and bringing and
laying downe the money at the Apoſtles feet, was practiſed (we know)
in the Apoſtles times, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 34, 35. And <hi>as Tertullian witneſſeth, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued</hi>
200. <hi>yeeres together in the Church.</hi> But I know no man now that pleads
for the neceſſity of any ſuch practice, yea whether it would not bee
much inexpedient for the Goſpell, (and conſequently in ſome degrees
unlawfull) if now put in practice, a few thoughts would ſufficiently
diſcover.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, There is no queſtion to be made, but that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times the diverſification of circumſtances, and aſpects of things in
the world, and courſe of Gods providence, have not onely a lawfull
power of diſſolving the binding force and authority of many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
but of ſuſpending our obedience to many rules, precepts, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations:
as for example, that kinde of ſalutation betweene men
mentioned, <hi>Gen. 27. 26. 1 Sam,</hi> 20. 41. and oft elſewhere, being generally
left and out of uſe; thoſe injunctions of <hi>Paul, Rom. 16. 16. 1 Cor.</hi> 16.
20. and elſewhere, Greet yea one another with an holy kiſſe, impoſe
no ſuch literality upon the Saints in theſe dayes as they did, when
they were written; neither doe I conceive (nor I ſuppoſe you) that
the Elders of the Church are now bound to annoint the ſick with
oyle, becauſe this is commanded, <hi>James</hi> 5. 14. neither doe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95015:3"/>
that the French Churches lye under any guilt of
ſin, for ſuffering their teachers to have their heads cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in their publicke miniſtry notwithſtanding that rule or
direction of <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 4. Every man praying or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
having any thing on his head, diſhonoureth his head,
becauſe that topicall cuſtome amongſt the <hi>Grecians,</hi> upon
which <hi>Paul</hi> built this rule or aſſertion, is wholly diſuſed by their
Nation, and the contrary generally practiſed amongſt them.
Though I doe not thinke this Scripture is to be reſtrained to
the teacher only, but to concerne as well the whole Aſſembly of
men preſent, who are all here ſaid to pray or prophecy in a paſſive
ſenſe, (as women alſo are) that is, to partake of theſe ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with the teacher: Other like inſtances might be given. And
doubtleſſe the rule that <hi>Cameron</hi> gives, who was a man of as
much learning, ſharpeneſſe of wit, and happineſſe in opening the
Scriptures as any the reformed Churches in <hi>France,</hi> yea I may ſay
in any part of the world have enjoyed of latter times, is moſt true.
<hi>There are many things commanded in</hi> Pauls <hi>Epiſtles, whereof there is
no uſe at this day,</hi> (viz. as touching the literall and preciſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation)
as is that of prophecying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. and concerning the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of women prophecying, which belong not to our times; but
concerning prophecying wee ſhall God willing move ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Quere's afterward. And I verily beleeve, that <hi>one maine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and grand occaſion of all ſeparation from</hi> us, (on that hand you
are gone) is, <hi>becauſe the words of the ſacred text fitted to particular
occaſions, and to the condition of the times wherein they were written,
are taken and applyed by ſuch men to themſelves and others, as they find
them, without due reſpect had to thoſe weighty and materiall differences
that are between one and the other:</hi> as might be demonſtrated at large,
(if it were any part of our preſent purpoſe.) In the meane time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
it is by what hath beene ſaid, that though particular inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
could be produced, wherein the Covenant ſo much magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſo indiſpenſably urged by your Churches (generally) upon
their members before their particular admiſſion, yea by ſome Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of your way defended in writing as the <hi>very forme and eſſence
of a true Church,</hi> (the writing here hath gone a long time under
your owne name, but of late I heare you have diſclaimed it) hath
beene practiſed by former Churches and put upon thoſe which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95015:4"/>
deſired memberſhip with them, yet there is no ſufficient ground to
conclude a neceſſity now lying upon all Churches to doe the like,
except there be a precept or command found for the doing of it,
no nor yet to prove a lawfulneſſe of doing it, except circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
lye cleare and faire for the doing it, nay a precept or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it ſelfe will not evince a neceſſity hereof, if any maſter or
grand circumſtance be now changed or altered, upon which the
precept was given: but yet notwithſtanding I adde, in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place, neither doe the Scriptures afford <hi>any inſtance or example,</hi>
wherein any ſuch Covenant hath ever <hi>been demanded or exacted</hi> by
any particular Church of thoſe who deſired fellowſhip with it:
But <hi>many inſtances</hi> there are wherein <hi>onely upon a ſober profeſſion</hi> of
their faith in Chriſt and entertainement of the Goſpell, men have
beene received into Churches <hi>without the leaſt noiſe or mention of any
ſuch Covenant. Act.</hi> 2. 41. They that <hi>gladly received his word were
Baptized,</hi> and the ſame day there were added unto [the Church]
about three thouſand ſoules: ſome of your judgements ſtrongly
conceite that they eſpy their Covenant in theſe words [were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;]
but ſurely if they were aſſiſted by the ſame imagination they
might as ſoone diſcover it in thoſe words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
God made Heaven and Earth; for to any reaſonable and
diſingaged apprehenſion, that word [were added] with the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of converts joyned with it, onely expreſſeth the exceeding
great worke of God, in making ſo great an enlargement or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to his Church in ſo ſhort a time: and doubtleſſe a man
muſt get a diſpenſation for his underſtanding, to enable him to
thinke or beleeve that within the compaſſe of halfe a day, or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more at the moſt, perhaps ſomewhat leſſe, (for the former
part of the day was well ſpent before <hi>Peter</hi> began his Sermon, <hi>verſ.</hi>
15. and how long he continued the Preaching is uncertain,
it ſeemes he was not very briefe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 40.) three thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſhould particularly and diſtinctly one after another in
the ſame place and before the ſame perſons being examined
and tryed, take a ſolemne Covenant repeating the Contents
and words thereof; doubtleſſe the art and method of ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
is utterly loſt and periſhed at this day, either the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
they made was very briefe, and but an act to yours, or
elſe the motion of their tongues in ſpeaking was much ſwifter
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95015:4"/>
then our thoughts: you muſt favour your ſelfe beyond al reaſon
in both theſe ſuppoſitions, or elſe ſuppoſe no longer your Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
here. Beſides evident it is, that theſe that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Church, were baptized before; this is affirmed of
them: Now being baptized, and that in an orderly and right
way, as you will not deny, this did immediately qualifie them
for Church fellowſhip according to your owne grounds, and
the truth it ſelfe, therefore they needed not the mediation of a
Covenant to make them capable hereof: ſo that you ſee an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility
of any Covenant to be emplyed here. And if you be
not relieved at this doore, there is little hopes to find more
charity in this kind at others: <hi>Philip</hi> required no other Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
or condition of the <hi>Eunuch</hi> to qualifie him for baptiſme,
and thereby to give him entrance into the Church, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to beleeve in the Lord Jeſus with all his heart, and to
profeſſe it to him, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 37. When <hi>Saul</hi> aſſayed to joyne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with the Diſciples at Hieruſalem, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 26. the reaſon
why they declined him for a time, was not becauſe they ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
a Covenant to him and he refuſed it, but becauſe they were
all afraide of him and beleeved not that he was a Diſciple; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
that had they beleeved this concerning him that he
had beene a Diſciple, a beleever, they would have received
him without any more adoe; yea upon <hi>Barnabas</hi> his meere Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of him without any Covenant ſubſcribed, confeſſion
made, or word ſpoken by himſelfe, he was received, <hi>verſ.</hi>
27. 28. So againe <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 24. there is mention made of many
that were added or joyned to the Lord, <hi>i. e.</hi> were immembred
into the Church, but no more words of any ſuch Covenant
as you urge, then <hi>a deafe man may heare:</hi> If you peruſe the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the New Teſtament further, you will eſpie many more
Starres of the conſtellation, neither can you here have recourſe
to thoſe Covenants mentioned in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.
3. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 38. to patterne you withall, for then you flee to
a <hi>Sanctuary which your ſelfe have polluted,</hi> by deſtroying all ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
and agreement betweene a nationall Church and that
which you call inſtituted or particular: and beſides to forſake
the guidance of the Spirit of God under the New Teſtament,
to ſeeke to make out our thoughts by the old, is to aske <hi>the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95015:5"/>
twilight in the Evening, whether it were light at noone day.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
if deſire of brevity (for the preſent) did not binde my
hands, it were eaſie to demonſtrate unto you what a ſolemne
diſagreement there is many wayes betweene theſe Covenants
and yours, and particularly in that preciſe circumſtance which
muſt have relieved you.</p>
            <p>3. To me there is no imaginable uſe or neceſſity of this your
Covenant, becauſe beleevers, willing, or agreeing, to live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the ſame body are bound by greater bonds a thouſand
fold then any Covenant they can make betweene themſelves, to
performe mutually all, and all manner of love, ſervice and
Chriſtian duties whatſoever, <hi>Chriſt himſelfe is the greateſt of bands</hi>
and of all manner of obligements or ingagements whatſoever
both to knit and hold Chriſtians together, and to make them
of one heart and of one Soule, and to keepe them ſo: by whom
(by Chriſt) <hi>all the body being coupled and knit together by every
joynt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 16. And where the Scripture ſpeakes of other
bands with him and beſides him, (yet all relating to him) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing
and binding Chriſtians together as cloſe as ever their
hearts and ſoules will packe or worke into one, amongſt them
all your Covenant commeth not into any mention or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
There is one body, one Spirit, even as ye are called
in one hope of your vocation, There is one Lord, one faith, one
baptiſme, one God and Father of all; ſurely if they had beene
joyned and joynted together by any ſuch Covenant as you
ſpeake of, and this Covenant beene of divine juſtification, and
of that high and Soveraigne conſequence as to give them their
very life, being and ſubſiſtence as a Church or body, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
could not have ſo farre forgot himſelfe as not to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventoried
it amongſt its fellowes, eſpecially there being no
place (that I can readily call to mind) more commodious
throughout all his writings to have made a particular and an
expreſſe mention hereof then here: And for my part I freely
and ingenuouſly and in the ſimplicity of my heart profeſſe unto
you, that I neither know what further or greater duty or ſervice
of love in any kind I can deſire or wiſh of thoſe my brethren
in Chriſt, upon whom the providence of God together with my
owne voluntary election either hath or hereafter ſhall caſt me in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95015:5"/>
Church-fellowſhip, then what they ſtand bound by the common band
of our mutuall intereſt in the ſame God, in the ſame Lord, in
the ſame baptiſme, in the ſame faith, in the ſame hope, &amp;c. to exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
tender, and performe unto mee without the expreſſe of any
ſuch covenant made with or unto me; nor yet can I conceive how poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
I ſhould have any better, richer or ſtronger aſſurance from them
for the performance hereof unto me by the vertue or aide of any ſuch
covenant above what I have by the power of that grace and godlineſſe
which (as farre as I am able to judge) worketh effectually in them,
and ſubjecteth them to all the ſaid bands and obligations; nor can I
thinke that he <hi>whoſe ſtrength to doe</hi> evill will ſerve to <hi>trample under feet the
blood of the Lord Chriſt, to caſt the Commandements of the glorious God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
his backe to betray the hope</hi> of his owne peace and glory, will ever
be kept in a Chriſtian compaſſe towards me by any promiſe, band, or
covenant of his owne, I know not how to thinke it a ſinne in me not
to deſire or exact a greater ſecuritie for my portion in the Saints then
God himſelfe hath given me, and eſtabliſhed me in: I heare your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
bee, that your covenant reſpecteth as well every mans faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
towards God as diſcharge of dutie towards one another, and
therefore in this regard (at leaſt) there may be a neceſſitie of it. To this
I make anſwer in few words; Firſt, why is not then the unneceſſary
part, at leaſt of your Covenant (which I conceive is the greateſt) <hi>viz.</hi>
that which concernes the Covenanters dutie towards his fellow ſtruck
off? Secondly, if ſuch a Covenant as this, with or towards God bee ſo
neceſſary a dutie, why is the place of it no where to be found amongſt
all the Commandements of God? doubtleſſe God requires it not at
our hands, <hi>to be either more provident or zealous for his glory then he is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi>
Thirdly and laſtly, it is neither lawfull before baptiſme, nor neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
after; therefore the neceſſitie of it falls to the ground, and is not
defenſible; that it is not lawfull before baptiſme is evident, becauſe it
is not lawfull for a Church to receive the unbaptized into fellowſhip
with them as members of that body, neither is there example or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of warrant in Scripture for ſuch a thing. As evident it is that
after baptiſme it is altogether unneceſſary, becauſe baptiſme doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
qualifie, for Church fellowſhip, (as hath beene ſayd, your
owne principles not gaineſaying) and the Church it ſelfe, by admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any to her baptiſme, <hi>(ipſo facto)</hi> admits into her fellowſhip and
communion. Therefore I adde:</p>
            <p>4. That the requiring and <hi>exacting of ſuch a Covenant</hi> of men, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95015:6"/>
the imparting of Church fellowſhip upon it, I conceive it to be <hi>an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
uſurpation upon the conſciences of men,</hi> and <hi>a tempting of God,</hi>
by laying ſuch a burden upon his people, which he muſt give ſtrength
(more then otherwayes were neceſſary) to beare, or otherwiſe they
muſt ſuffer (at leaſt) (if not fall) under it; and I beleeve, I know ſome
worthy every wayes of the honour (according to the line of men)
who deſirous of entrance into ſome of your Churches were turned
back, by diſlike of that new doore of your Covenant.</p>
            <p>5. And laſtly, We conceive the exacting and giving of ſuch a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
is not onely a thing unneceſſary <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>ſomething
above any thing that is written,</hi> but of worſe inconvenience alſo, (at leaſt, as
many of thoſe that are ingaged in it, are wont to interpret and draw
the importance hereof) for many looke upon a Covenant they have
made with a particular Church as a partition wall wholly to ſeparate
them in care, affection, dependance, and from all other Churches and
the Saints of God throughout the world, and take it for an authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
diſcharge, and releaſe from heaven from troubling themſelves any
wayes with the affaires of other Churches as miniſtring unto their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
at any times. It was not much ſhort of this which a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
of you faith profeſſed plainely unto me not long ſince, and
that before ſome witneſſes. <hi>Calvin</hi> well obſerves upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 16. that
<hi>Pauls</hi> ſtudy and deſire was by his carefull remembrance and ſending
the mutuall ſalutations and greeting of one Church to another, <hi>quantum
in ſe eſt, mutuo amoris nexu devincire inter ſe omnia Chriſti membra:</hi>
As far as it lay in his power, to bind all members of Chriſt whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in one and the ſame mutuall band of affection together. Now if
<hi>Paul</hi> herein did the will and Commandement of God, (which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
thinke you will deny) then as your Saviour charged the Scribes
and Phariſees, that they had made the Commandement of God of
none effect (they had taken a courſe to doe it, they had done that
which directly tended thereunto) by their traditions, ſo (we conceive)
we may juſtly challenge your <hi>Covenant</hi> for an <hi>ill looke,</hi> or <hi>maligne aſpect,</hi>
upon that part of the will of God, wherein he deſires that all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
the world over ſhould deſire to maintaine a free intercourſe of
the deareſt love and tendereſt affections one towards another.</p>

deerely longed after your boſome, and would hardly have beene kept

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95015:7"/>

what ſorrow we can againſt the time of your returne, and for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
endeavour our ſelves to make your miſtakes as innocent as may
be, and to keepe as many as we can from falling thereby. Deare brother
that there were a heart in us to lay our heads together to finde out (if
poſſible) ſome courſe <hi>that the Sword may not alwayes thus devoured</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
there are waters to be found that will much aſſwage the heate, if
not wholly quench the flames of theſe contentions and diviſions. How
greatly is it to be lamented that he by whom <hi>God hath reconciled the world
to himſelfe, ſhould be made a meanes of dividing this reconciled world between
themſelves!</hi> The heavens (I doubt not) will accord us, yet were it our
greater comfort and glory if they might be prevented herein by the
earth. I verily beleeve it would ſtrike a great ſtroake in compremiſing
this contention, if the <hi>great men and chiefe leaders</hi> on both ſides could be
perſwaded but to take faſt hold upon this free and noble reſolution,
which yet I ſuppoſe we all intend to doe, <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>rather to do ſacrifice to the truth then to be in bondage to ſuppoſtions.</hi>
I know not how to open my mouth wide enough to ſhew you the
inlargement of my heart unto you, if wee ſaw the truth clearely with
you, <hi>you ſhould not raigne alone,</hi> wee would doubtleſſe at once divide
ſuch a kingdome with you. Many indeed of your partie are ready to
ſay in effect, that as it is heaven that ſeparated you from us, ſo it is
the world that ſeparates us from you: But if you have the truth with
you (which indeed if you have at leaſt in many of your beloved Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes,
woe to my wits, reaſon and underſtanding; never poore man
ſo ſtrangely miſuſed by ſuch friends in this world) it would never bee
a debtor to ſuch interpretors or agents for it. As for the world, if it
be as little on that ſide the Sea as it is on this, it will never be ſo much
as a moate in your eye to hinder you from ſeeing any truth of God
clearely. But as little as it is with us, we thinke it <hi>too great and too good
to be ſacrificed upon the ſervice of an errour at any time.</hi> Otherwiſe I doubt
not but the Saints of God in England tread as light upon the earth, as
you doe in Holland, and are as ready to buy the truth and give as good
rates for it as the beſt Merchants among you, but howſoever I knew

it any advantage to the truth and cauſe we maintaine againſt you, wee

will never be made great by ſuch demonſtrations or arguments as theſe
on either ſide, <hi>ſometimes the truth is there where a man for many reaſons
would thinke there were leaſt hope to find it, and againe many times faire over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and many pleaſing inducements will but deceive and diſappoint men in
this kind.</hi> And as for that kind of truth which wee inquire after and
toyle in the fire of contention to find out, <hi>viz.</hi> ſpirituall and divine,
there is no ſubſtantiall and ſatisfying meanes for the diſcovery of it,
but by a holy, humble and unpartiall conſultation with the oracles of
God, yea if it be of that ſpecies or eſpeciall kind of truth which is not
ſpread (like the Mannah) upon the face of the Scriptures, but lyeth
low amongſt the deepe things of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2, 10. as it ſeemeth your
truth in thoſe queſtions depending betweene us in part doth; now it

and againe, both ſolitary and in conſort, they muſt bee put home to it,

plainely in this caſe or deliver out any of this treaſure, yea in many
caſes a man muſt be content to goe to one end of the Scripture to know
what they meane in the other, yea (that which is much conſiderable,
and I feare wants that which belongs to it) they may ſeeme to deliver

great way off in the field, and muſt be ſent for before he comes: ſo the
annointed ſenſe and meaning of the Scriptures may yet bee farre off
when we perſwade our ſelves with the greateſt confidence it is before

a man muſt caſt away many interpretations of Scripture, (and thoſe
ſometimes ſuch as otherwiſe he would not wittingly part with)
that he may interpret at laſt as he ought to doe. I make no queſtion
but you have had experience hereof in your ſelfe more then once; for
