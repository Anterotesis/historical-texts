            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>PErfection is a Flower, that grows not in the Garden of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary World: the faireſt Day may be overcaſt with Clouds; the Moon hath her Spots, and the Greateſt their Failings. No Perſon can plead Priviledge from Error in this Life; for as the Poet ſaith,

            <p>Theſe things conſidered, it is an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to me, that this Innocent and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:172940:5"/>Harmleſs Sex ſhould meet with ſuch Calumnies (as palpable as injurious) from Hypercritical Men; ſuch as are <hi>Facie tantum Homines, non Animo;</hi> who bear about them nothing but the Form of Man that's manly; whoſe beſt Elocution is the worſt Detracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, labouring to vilifie them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe Being they had not been; therefore to them, as to our Second Self, we owe, at leaſt, the Duty of Good Language. Beyond all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, he is a barbarous Parricide to his Mother's Name, that ingratefully murders her Reputation who contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to his Generation; gave him Lodging and Diet in her own Womb; brought him into the World with Grief, Pain, and Sorrow; bred him up in the World with Care, Coſt, and Trouble; and, in Requital, hath no other Return, when he arrives at Maturity, than Foul Ink for the pure Milk wherewith ſhe fed him in his Infancy. Such Perſons as theſe, like

Thus we ſee the pureſt White is moſt ſubject to the ſmutch, and the moſt unſpotted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to the Beſpattering of Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent Tongues. Thus Noble Gold down to the Bottom goes, whilſt worthleſs Cork above doth floating lye; and, as one ſaith very well:

            </p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:172940:6"/>
            <p>But to proceed. Thoſe uſual Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs and Invectives againſt that Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-temper'd Sex, only Betray Man's greater Imbecillity; for we know, a a good Cauſe needs not the Patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Paſſion, but can maintain it ſelf by a Moderate Diſpute: beſides, a ſerious Reflection upon Man's own Unworthineſs, methinks, ſhould make him backward in challenging Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative above Woman; and I would adviſe ſuch opinionative Fops, who are Bladder'd up, as much as the Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Pride and Vanity can make them, not to have an overſhooting Conceit of themſelves; but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber they are Men, whoſe Reaſon is frequently over-clouded with Error. We are all Moles, even to the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of our own Sins; but, in a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male's Life, we can ſpy out the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Peccadillo</hi> with Eagle's Eyes, or thoſe as ſharp, as the <hi>Epidaurean</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's. But certenly they are not Men, who thus Rail againſt that Sex:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:172940:6"/>no; they'r a Viperous Brood, whom Women, in Charity, take into their Boſoms and cheriſh, for which they ingratefully ſting them; a Fact ſo barbarous, the <hi>Turc</hi> himſelf would Bluſh to do it to a Chriſtian. And would it not vex a Royal Spleen? A Paſſion kindle in a Stoic's Breaſt, to ſee them thus abus'd? Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this; there are ſome Men, (would I cou'd only ſay ſom) tho beyond all diſpute the Children of the <hi>Meu Peuple,</hi> of a ſordid and Baſe Extract, who never think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves well, but when they are in the Predicament of injurious Paſſion. Nay farther, (if we may credit <hi>Fonſeca,</hi> as undoubtedly we may) he ſays, (and that modeſtly too) <hi>Non poſſunt omnes Invectivae &amp; Satyrae in Foemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas ſcriptae uno Volumine comprehendi.</hi> All the Invectives and Satyrs againſt Women cannot be comprehended in one Volume. Yet I'l be bold to maintain; That thoſe Rude and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:172940:7"/>Pamphlets, which Men have ſcribled againſt that Sex, do ſo ſtink in the Noſtrils of Good Men (who have compos'd as much, nay more in their merited Commendation) that they are only thought fit to be bound up with the Metamorphoſis of <hi>A-jax,</hi> and placed in <hi>Pantagruel</hi>'s Library; ſo that in ſhort, this only proves, that every Countrey-man can produce a ſnarling <hi>Momus,</hi> and every Age a ſcoffing <hi>Lucian;</hi> But this profligate Crew are only ſuch, as have vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of their Souls all remnants of Goodneſs; and who can expect a ſweet Breath from ſuch foul Stomacs. Their Reaſons (if any) are but the Froth and Scum of Envy and Malice; the Fruits of Choler Aduſt, and the Evaporations of a Vindicative Spirit: Now what they are, and of what Weight you ſhall ſoon underſtand; and in order thereunto we will firſt remove this Rubbiſh from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, for the better conſolidating
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:172940:7"/>of the Superſtructure; by demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting how eaſily their Aſperſions and Sarcaſins (as full of Obloquy, as pregnant with Impertinence) may be wip'd off.</p>
            <p>Firſt, They object, that Male and Female God made Man, ſo that Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt named, is the worthier Perſon; A pretty Argument indeed! ſo the Evening and the Morning made the firſt day; yet few will think the Night better. But the Noble<note n="*" place="margin">Giovanni Franciſco Loredana.</note> 
               <hi>Venetian,</hi> is ſo far from this Opinion, that he tells you plainly, had it not been infus'd into <hi>Adam</hi> by Revelation, that Woman was a part of himſelf, doubtleſs Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience had not been the firſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication, but Idolatry; for <hi>Adam</hi> was about to adore her as a Goddeſs.</p>
            <p>O! but Man was made her Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſo conſequently, her Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour; to which one anſwers very pertinently; That 'twas not the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of his Worth, but the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:172940:8"/>of her Sin; had they both ſtood, 'tis probably conjectur'd ſhe had never been in that ſubjection.

Now in that Book there is a Doubt made, whether Woman was created after God's Image? Therefore, becauſe the Doubt is made, the Book it ſelf is ſuſpected, not to have ſo Great, ſo Conſtant an Author, as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was; No Author of Gravity, Piety, and Converſation in the Scripture,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:172940:9"/>could admit that Doubt, Whether Woman was created in the Image of God, that is, in poſſeſſion of a Reaſonable and Immortal Soul? And farther, Woman, as well as Man, was made after the Image of God in the Creation; and in the Reſurrection, when we ſhall riſe, her Sex ſhall not diminiſh her Glory, of which ſhe receives a very fair Beam and Incho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in this Text; That the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God is communicated by the Miniſtry of Angels to Women.</q>

            <p>But yet the Vulgar believe, that if there be no Ill in handſom Women, at leaſt, there is inconvenience; that Tentation is there, tho the Sin be not. To this Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> in his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd Woman anſwers: When Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the occaſion of Ill, 'tis an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent that makes the Offender, and thoſe that complain of it do as idly, as if one ſhould accuſe the Sun for dazling his ſight, when he looks too fixedly on that glorious Body.</p>
            <p>Some Buffoons have been ſo bold as to ſay, that Woman is a crooked Rib, and conſequently of a crooked Temper; but that is a great miſtake; for a Rib is bending, and preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth her pliant, not her crooked Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Another Objection againſt that Sex is, That one cannot love a Woman
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:172940:15"/>and be wiſe; a Groſs, Erroneous Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net: for it is the opinion of wiſer Heads, That One cannot truly love, and not be wiſe; and ſurely this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion will ſoon be hiſs'd off of the Stage by Men, both young and old, or elſe they proclame themſelves all Fools; ſince Mr. <hi>Brathwait</hi> tells you, <hi>p.</hi> 288.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Look all about you; who ſo young that loves not?</l>
               <l>And who ſo old, a comely Feature moves not?</l>
            </q>
            <p>If you object, and bid us look up to Heaven, there are but two among the Planets, <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> all the reſt are Males: you may as well argue that among the Celeſtial Signs there are but three human Creatures, and ſeven brute Animals with two inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that there are more brutes in Heaven than men, would not this be a brutiſh Argument. And Mr. <hi>Howel</hi> in his Epiſtles will tell you, that he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:172940:15"/>believes there are as many Female as Male Saints in Heaven. But Sir, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der favour, whereas you alledge, that among the heavenly Planets there are but two Females, the reſt Males, it ſhews that Men are of a more erratick and wandring humour than Women.</p>
            <p>Thus Men beſtow ill favour'd Names and Expreſſions (or rather Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions) on lovely things, as Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; like Aſtronomers, that call ſuch Stars Bulls and Scorpions that have neither Fury nor Venome, but only Purity and Light.</p>
            <p>But Woman was tempted firſt, and therefore to blame; not ſo: for, in the firſt Sin her Fault was leaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her Temptation was greateſt and ſtrongeſt, being beguil'd by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Serpent, but Man by a deceived or miſtaken Woman. Man was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited eating the forbidden Fruit, for Woman was not then created; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſinned by reaſon the Charge was made to him. <hi>Whitlock</hi>'s Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Lady, <hi>p.</hi> 331.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:172940:16"/>
            <p>Another Accuſation is, That Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Women are Scornful; but when we think well of it, we ſhall find their Diſdain proceeds rather from Conſcience than Vanity, becauſe they cannot endure the Idolatrous purſuits of the exceſſive Praiſes, which Men artificially offer up to ſurprize them. <hi>Mountague</hi>'s <hi>A. W. p.</hi> 105. And they that think Women cannot be obliging underſtand little of the Nature of Virtue, and are ſo far from a right Opinion that they are abſolutely void of all common Senſe and Civility.</p>
            <p>That Womens Piety is but tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Nature, or weakneſs of their Wits: thoſe that imagine thus are not of my Opinion, ſaith <hi>Mountague, p.</hi> 30. and methinks they do them no leſs affront to deny them this Divine Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, than if they ſhould take their Eyes from them, which makes the beſt part of the Face: beſides, Piety is oftner found as well as Pity in the tender and ſoft-hearted, than
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:172940:16"/>in the more Rough and Robuſtuous Tempers.</p>
            <p>That Timorouſneſs reſtrains Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from Courtſhip more than Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; this is ill argued; for if their Inclination be ill, Sollicitation will embolden it. Indeed there have bin Men that have poſſeſs'd this Virtue upon occaſion, where ſome Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations have taken away the Merit from it. Witneſs <hi>Alexander,</hi> who te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified ſome Conſtancy to <hi>Darius</hi> his Wives; but to ſhew it was rather out of Politie than Virtue, what did he not with the <hi>Amazons?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Women are of a fearful and cowardly Temper. I cannot think that Men have reaſon to call Women Fearful, becauſe they are not haſty and unadvis'd; for they that know their Temper, will confeſs, they have a greater diſpoſition to true Courage than Man; being neither cold to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Inſenſibleneſs, nor hot to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Raſhneſs. <hi>Mountag. A. W.</hi> p. 49.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:172940:17"/>
            <p>Upon this Account, I ſuppoſe, it was more curiouſly than uſefully, more ſubtilly than fruitfully demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, why Woman might not as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>Woe</hi> Man, as Man Woman? And that <hi>Arabian</hi> Reſolution retrieved from the very depth of Imagination, with much Ingenuity aſſoiled the Queſtion. Woing, ſaid the <hi>Arabian</hi> Wit, is a Lovely Seeking; now we ſeek not for that we have, but what we have not: it is more proper for the Man in Love's Queſt to ſeek for what he has loſt, than for the Woman to ſeek for what ſhe already has. The Man hath loſt his Rib, and he ſeeks after her that has it: it is for him to ſeek it, who, tho he may not have it, yet he ſeeks to enjoy her who has it. <hi>Brathwait,</hi> Sect. 2. p. 442.</p>
            <p>As to their Levity and Inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whatſoever Slanderers invent to their diſparagement in that particular, we muſt confeſs they are more firm in their Paſſions than Men; at leaſt,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:172940:17"/>we learn by the Holy Writ, that on the moſt noble occaſion that ever of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it ſelf, where we owe more Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Courage to the Service of God; there were ſeen three <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> under the Croſs, and <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> conſtantly followed him to the very laſt, when the Diſciples fell off, after all their Proteſtations of never deſerting him.</p>
            <p>Women are ſhallow, and unfit for Knowledge; methinks this is to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge of Conſtitutions; which, as the Phyſicians and Philoſophers ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more delicate than ours, is alſo better diſpoſed for it; but it may be 'tis an effect of their Judicious Choice to quit freely the Vexatious muſings of Studie's weariſomneſs; I may ſay without flattering them, or pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this Inſinuation to the Honour of their good Graces, that they are capable of as many Virtues as Men; and if ſometimes they quit their claim, which they may lay to them, 'tis ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:172940:18"/>out of Modeſty or Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than Unaptneſs. Nay, there have not been wanting Champions in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, Law, and Hiſtory, to anſwer or confute Oppoſers, and ſome of them, to ſay truth, have not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the Cauſe effeminately. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> counted it worth his pains to beſtow a whole Book <hi>De Virtutibus Mulierum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now adays ſuch is the ſad Fate of Females, they are depriv'd of all means to advance themſelves; ſo that no wonder they are not publickly Famous, being forc'd to lead a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd Life at home; their Needle is their only Recreation, or Cloyſter'd in ſome Nunnery, or if married, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to their Husband's Humour. Men beſpatter them, becauſe their Soul is not contain'd in ſo rich a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet; they climb by Intruſion to Honour and Dignity, not by Title or Merit, not by Rule or Divine Command, but by Strength and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:172940:18"/>might. The beſt Land incultivated bears nothing but Briers and Thorns, where Art and Labour might bring forth Lillies and Tulips; it is that that is often wanting to their good Inclinations and Deſires, when Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, or ſome other misfortune barrs them the poſſeſſion of theſe fair Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, of which Nature has given them a Capacity.</p>
            <p>The Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> declared <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> the wiſeſt of men; and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, that his <hi>Diotinia</hi> taught him the Wiſdom and Prudence which the Gods themſelves judged incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It was no ſmall advantage to this Woman to inſtruct this Philoſopher, who might preſcribe Rules to all men for Life and manners. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> the great Civilian, would not judge of any matter till he had firſt given an account of it to his Wife. And <hi>Plutarch</hi> writes, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Lady <hi>Porcia</hi> endeared <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegus</hi> ſo far, that he enterpriz'd no
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:172940:19"/>Deſign, nor managed any Affair with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her Advice and Approbation. <hi>Priſcilla</hi> was ſo knowing, that ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed <hi>Apollo,</hi> a Biſhop, and <hi>Aſpatia</hi> was judged worthy to teach <hi>Pericles.</hi> Nay, whole Nations, as well as ſingle Perſons, have honoured them for their Knowledge. The <hi>Scythian</hi> Women judged of Publick matters, and their Verdict was of great Eſteem.</p>
            <p>Our Antient <hi>Gauls</hi> divided with them the Glory of Peace and War, reſerving only the Active part of Arms unto themſelves, and leaving the Women the Eſtabliſhment of Laws, and Preſervation of Commonwealths; that was not to be done by Ignorant Perſons; and one may judge in what eſteem our Anceſtors held them, ſince they allotted to the Men only the Exerciſe of the Body, and to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the Abilities of the Mind.</p>
            <p>But Women are Deceitful, and can command Tears at will: Admit they can, and do frequently weep, it is a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:172940:19"/>great Argument of their Tenderneſs and Pity; for a Woman, if ever ſhe weeps, ſhe thinks her ſelf oblig'd ſo to do, becauſe all the World is not ſo good as ſhe her ſelf.</p>
            <p>It was a ſnarling Speech of a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nique, when paſſing by a Tree where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Maid had hang'd her ſelf, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that all Trees might bear ſuch Fruit; but his very name implies an Anſwer; it was a Dog-like and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Expreſſion.</p>
            <p>The odd opinion that the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> have of Women, that they are of an Inferior Creation to Man, and therefore exclude them, the one from their Synagogues, and the other from their <hi>Moſquets,</hi> is in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not onely Partial, but Prophane; for the Image of the Creator ſhines as much in the one as in the other. <hi>Howel</hi>'s Letters.</p>
            <p>Some will deprive Women of their Priviledge of going abroad; and I know what Philoſopher he was
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:172940:20"/>that would have them appear but thrice abroad all their Life-time; at their Chriſtening, Marriage, and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial; but the reaſon was not their Wantonneſs, but his own Luſt, that he might have the better opportunity to go the oftener to them at home in private; and in truth Jealouſie (which was one cauſe of it) is a fear which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers not ſo much, as it confeſſeth, the Merit of our Enemy. Yet I am not ſo Laconically ſevere (ſaith <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> in his Melancholy) or Stoically Rigid, as to debarr Women of all Society and Meetings, they may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them by a Civil and Moral Uſe, to their Advantage and Benefit, they may Converſe with a modeſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Freedom.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue ſtyles a Friend <hi>Amicus,</hi> a Sweet-heart <hi>Amica;</hi> and in this that Language is Injurious to that Sex, as if it were incapable of any kind of Familiarity or Friendſhip, but in way of Marriage. <hi>Fuller</hi> in his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:172940:20"/>Holy State; but daily Experience confutes this Argument, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis not worthy an Anſwer.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Herculean</hi> and Irrefragable Argument is ſtill to come; <hi>viz.</hi> That Women are ſubject to paint, which is a kind of Self-Adultery, a Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis of God's Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But one of the beſt Wits of our Nation hath penn'd a Treatiſe in Defence of it, call'd Auxiliary or Artificial Beauty; who ſaith, It is but a Fixation of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's Inconſtancy, and is no more Adulterating of God's Works, than to die Wool, Linnen, or Silk, out of their Native Simplicity, or to waſh the Scurf and Filth off, which riſeth naturally from our Bodies by Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Evaporation.</p>
            <p>It is no more the Adulterating of Nature, than the applying of ſweet Smells and Scents to our Clothes, Bodies, or Breath; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a Delight, but Remedy to the Native Rankneſs or Offenſiveneſs
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:172940:21"/>which ſome Perſons are ſubject to, both in their Breath and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which not to Cure, or alter by Art, is to condemn ſuch Perſons (otherwiſe not ill Company) to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, by reaſon of thoſe very Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, which make them fitter for Cells than Society.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We cannot,</hi> (that is, we may not) <hi>make one hair of our Head white or black, Matthew</hi> 5.36. So Men may not, by the ſame reaſon, that are Mad, be reſtrain'd from their Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, becauſe God hath afflicted them; ſo Sick men muſt bid Defiance to all Phyſicians, accounting them as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bold Giants, or Monſters, who daily ſeek to fight againſt Heaven by their Rebellious Drugs and Doſes, preſcribed in ſtrange affected Terms of Art, and ill-ſcribled Bills, which ſeem to be as ſo many Charms or Spells. So Lame Men may not either uſe Crutches to ſupply the weakneſs of their Legs, or to ſhore up the tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:172940:21"/>frame of their Body. Any one undoubtedly may lawfully redeem himſelf from the uncomelineſs of ſuch an untimely Accident, by dying his Hair, or by uſing a Perruque ſuitable to his greener Years, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with our Saviour's meaning, that we cannot make one Hair white or black, which only ſhews the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Bounds and Principles of Nature, as to God's Fixation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in all things; but not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the Ingenious Operations of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Art and Invention, to which the Works of God in Nature are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, ſo far as they are managed within the Limits of Moral Intention and Religious Ends.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to me no better than a ſtrait-lac'd Superſtition, which thus pinches God's Bounty, and a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's Liberty, which makes Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſuch a Captive to ſuch unneceſſary Rigors and pedling Severities, as if it were never in a due Poſture
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:172940:22"/>and Habit, till its Nails be pared to the quick, and its Hair ſhaven to the Skull. To be Godly, it is not neceſſary to be ugly; nor doth De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity add any thing to our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God's Mercy to our Souls, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies us not due care and conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Bodies.</p>
            <p>After theſe Methods of Holy Ill-husbandry, we muſt let our Fields and Gardens be oppreſſed under the Uſurpation of Brambles, and the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of all evil Weeds, which are the Products of Providence, as well as the beſt Herbs and Flowers; and you may not by the invention of Artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Day, ſupply the Sun's abſence with Candle or Torch-light, nor diſpell the horrour of that Darkneſs which Providence brings over the face of the Earth in the Night. You may as well diſcommend a Glaſs-Eye, when the Natural one is out. Surely Face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending is no ſin, nor to help a wither'd Autumnal Complexion no
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:172940:22"/>Crime; nor to fill up the Ranks and rotted Files of the Teeth with Ivory Adjutants and Lieutenants.</p>
            <p>The Sarcaſm which was us'd by a Witty and Eloquent Preacher, whom we both heard at <hi>Oxford</hi> (meaning the two Ladies diſputing about Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the Treatiſe of Auxiliary Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) who ſpeaking againſt the abuſe of Womens Ornaments, inſtanced in <hi>Jezabel</hi>'s being eaten with Dogs, as ſhewing (ſaith he) that a Woman ſo poliſhed and painted was not fit to be Man's meat; which Expreſſion had more of Wit and Jeſt in it, than Weight or Earneſt, as if the Heart received ſinful Infection by any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour or Tincture put to the Face, more than it doth moral defilement by any thing that enters into the Mouth.</p>
            <p>To deprive Women of Additional Arts, is to reduce them from the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Improvement of after Times and Experience, to their firſt Caves and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:172940:23"/>Cottages in primitive Skins and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prons.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> writing to <hi>Gaudenſius</hi> about the Clothes of young <hi>Pacutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> ſeems to excuſe the Curioſity of Women, in very remarkable terms. <q>Their Sex (ſaith he) is curious in Ornaments, and ſtudies natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Sumptuouſneſs of Clothes; inſomuch as I have ſeen many chaſte Ladies that dreſs themſelves very coſtly, without having any aim in their Deſigns, but their particular Contentment, by a certain harmleſs Complacency or Satisfaction. This Inclination is ſo natural to them, as heretofore many Ladies did intomb their Ornaments with themſelves, to carry into the other World that which they had acknowledged ſo much in this.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, there is a Story, That <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſeeing his Daughter <hi>Julia Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta</hi> too curiouſly brave, conſidered her a great while without gracing her
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:172940:23"/>with a Word, expreſſing his Diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by his Silence. The next day ſeeing her more modeſtly dreſs'd, he told her with a ſmiling Countenance, that that Habit better became the Daughter of <hi>Auguſtus:</hi> but the Reply of this Princeſs was not leſs conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than the Admoniſhment of the Emperour; I was dreſſed Yeſterday (ſaid ſhe) for my Husband, but to Day for my Father.</p>
            <p>But they will object, That Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is an adventitious Stealth, a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardly kind of Adoption.</p>
            <p>You never are jealous of any Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, Crimſon, or purple Tincture in your Cloaths, wherein you pleaſe your ſelves more than in deader co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: they are but the ſimple Juice or Extract of ſome innocent Herb, Leaf, Flower or Root, of which no other uſe in Phyſick or Food can be made.</p>
            <p>Beauty is a great Bleſſing among thoſe little momentary ones which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:172940:24"/>our Duſt is capable of; and artificial helps of Beauty carry with them their own Antidote, while they are Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of our Wants and Infirmities, which like the ſwallowing down the Stone keeps us from ſurfeiting of the Cherries we eat: and the remedying of Deformity, by artificial Applications can be no more a Temptation to Pride than the uſe of Crutches and Spectacles to thoſe that are lame and dim-ſighted. We read no where in Scripture that the Beauty and Bravery of Colours is either forbidden or reproved, unleſs unſeaſonably worn, when God calls for Sack-cloath and Blackneſs of Face. <hi>Lydia,</hi> a Seller of Purple, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. (whoſe Dye or finer Tincture was of more worth than the Subſtance it ſelf) yet is not forbidden, when ſhe was converted to be a Chriſtian, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dye or ſell any more of that rich Colour. Againſt this honeſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Painting nothing wars ſo much as Prejudice, and a kind of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:172940:24"/>Wontedneſs to think the contrary.</p>
            <p>Mr.<hi>Downam,</hi> in his Warfare, <hi>c.</hi> 14. calls Painting the Devil's Invention, a Sin, not only in the Abuſe but the very Uſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He brings <hi>Tertullian</hi> arguing againſt it as the Devil's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting and mocking of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he quotes St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> telling the veil'd Virgins, that the Devil, by theſe Arts, doth but diſtort and poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon what God hath made handſome and wholſome. He might have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many more, as I find in our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Authors, who produce the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> againſt all additional Beauty.</p>
            <p>No Soul was more ſhaken than I was (ſaith the Author of <hi>Auxiliary Beauty</hi>) in the minority of my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when I had more of Traditional Superſtition than of Judicious Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and valued more the number of mens Names than the weight of their Reaſons. And now out of the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:172940:25"/>and Minority which kept me in the Wardſhip and Awe of Mens Names and Number, I conſidered that theſe alone ſignified no more to make up any Reaſon, or to prove any Sin, (in point of Conſcience) than ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Counters can make up a Sum, which have no Figures before them.</p>
            <p>Good and Great Men are not ſet beyond Miſtakes.</p>
            <p>They might Decree poſſibly theſe Helps in ſome Women, not as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely evil, but as inexpedient and needleſs in thoſe times of Perſecution, when they were to be married to the Faggot and Flames. They do not oppoſe things of this Nature argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentatively ſo much as oratoriouſly; not denying the uſe of them to ſome Perſons, in ſome Caſes, at ſome times, but the Abuſe of them. Beſides, their greateſt ſtrictneſs ſeems to have been to Votaries or reſerv'd Virgins.</p>
            <p>How did many great Miniſters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh againſt <hi>Tobacco</hi> in the Pulpit,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:172940:25"/>before they generally fell to taking it themſelves, fancying at laſt, that they never had more devout Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or ſharp Inventions, than thoſe which were begun by the Midwifery of a Pipe of <hi>Tobacco.</hi> Their Report ſeems fitted to the Polity and Bent of thoſe Times. Mr. <hi>Downam</hi> did not diſtinguiſh between the thing done, and the End, or Mind of thoſe that do it; as if the ſober Relief of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Infirmity, or the modeſt Study of outward Decency, were the ſame thing with Pride, Levity, and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs. At the ſame rate he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh againſt quenching one's Thirſt, or drinking to Chearfulneſs, becauſe of the ſordid conſequences of Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Riot, and Debauchery.</p>
            <p>His other heap of Arguments are only aſſertory, not prefatory; he makes it not good, that it was an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Sin in the uſe, but neither by any Proofs, or pregnant Reaſon, or God's Word.</p>
            <pb n="44" facs="tcp:172940:26"/>
            <p>But all are lewd and wanton that uſe it, ſaith he; and this is as harſh as raſh for him to maintain: and how could he in Charity do it, unleſs he had known their Hearts that uſe thoſe Arts. Thus, like a mad Man with a Sword, he lays about, and ſmites all that come near him. Very few exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Marrow and Inſide of things, but take them upon the credit of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary Opinion. Few Mens Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſo died in Grain, but they will fade and diſcolour, being for the moſt part dip'd by vulgar Eaſineſs in common Opinion.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Particular, all is but verbal painting or oral colouring that is uſed againſt Artificial Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs, or Auxiliary Beauty; or like the ratling of Hail upon Tiles, which neither wets with Moiſture, nor pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth with it's Strokes and Noiſe. But that which I wonder at is, that Men ſhould rail againſt Women for that which they themſelves are more cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:172940:26"/>guilty: witneſs <hi>Hortenſius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Orator, who ſpent half the day in beholding and dreſſing himſelf in a Glaſs inſtead of ſtudying his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and <hi>Stratocles</hi> the Phyſician, that painted his wither'd Face and adorn'd himſelf to court his Miſtris.</p>
            <p>But truly I cannot yet ſee, but that in the height of religious Severity, it may be put among thoſe venial Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Humane Life, of which no ſtricter account in point of Morality need to be given or exacted, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Divine Intelligence by which God in innocent Freedom, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a Child, gives us leave to adorn and pleaſe our ſelves without any of his Diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>But admit, when all is ſaid and done, that Women when they prove bad are a ſort of the vileſt Creatures imaginable, yet ſtill the ſame Reaſon gives it, <hi>Corruptio optimi est peſſima,</hi> and this alſo will tend to their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in deſpite of all Oppoſers.</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:172940:27"/>
            <p>Thus they ſeek to murder Womens Reputation whenas they deſtroy their own; for, the Calumniator is but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Pigmalion,</hi> the Artiſan of his own Misfortune, and indeed, is a Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Tres uno perimit ictu;</hi> he kills three at once, <hi>viz.</hi> Himſelf, the Party that hears it, and the Perſon from whom he detracts. But, how truly do theſe Females trace the Method of Charity, to ſuffer all theſe opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Scoffs and Scurrilities without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action! Alas! they know that if Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cannot curb their laſhing Tongues, their Diſpraiſes will, after the manner of the <hi>Tartar</hi>'s Bow, ſhoot back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves from whence they came.

Woman ſcorns to flame at every fiery Tongue's Puff; for the Crackers of the Brain and Squibs of the Tongue will dye alone, if not reviv'd, and the beſt way to have them forgot by others, is firſt to forget them her ſelf. She has a Spirit planted above petty wrongs: the Temper of her <hi>Genius</hi> is too Stoical to be ſenſible in the leaſt of the weak Aſſaults of that Cowardly Pigmy, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, whom handſomly to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, is to ſcorn.</p>
            <p>By ſuch Obloquies Men think to debaſe Women, and all to as little purpoſe as to caſt Chains into the Sea, or to tye the Ocean with Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and theſe frequent Diſpraiſes at beſt are but the Faults of unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Men; But alas! ſhe that will queſtion every diſgraceful word that is ſpoken of her, ſhall have few Friends, little Wit, and much Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:172940:28"/>Let them conſider, that if there were neither Malice, nor Enemies in the World, there are few Things ſo ſure, or ſo true that cannot be taken divers ways; and if we examin well all our Actions, it ſeems that they are all ſubject to Interpretation and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. <hi>Mount.

            <p>Thus Men puff up themſelves as big as Pride and Vanity can make them, with a conceit of their own Meritoriouſneſs; tho it be a ſordid thing for a man to be the Herald of his own Praiſe: But it may be ſaid of theſe Airmongers as it is of the Cameleon, which is <hi>Nil praeter Pulmones,</hi> Nothing but Lungs, or of the Nightingale, <hi>Vox &amp; praeterea ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil,</hi> nothing but Voice; ſo that as it

Here is a Field for an Orator to uſe Eloquence in. Here is a Subject fit to put Phancie upon the Rack, and torture Wits, as Agues do Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.

            <p>When Providence firſt cleav'd our Sire, and made <hi>Eve</hi> out of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhe was created his Equal, only the difference was in the Sex, otherwiſe they both were Man. Her Body is more admirable and Beautiful than Man's, fuller of Curioſities and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's Wonders, both for Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and foſtering the producted Birth. And can we think God would put a worſe Soul into a better Body? Nay, if the Philoſophical Maxim holds good, <hi>That the Temperature of the Soul follows that of the Body,</hi> we muſt neceſſarily conclude, that as her out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſo her inward Affections muſt be more purely refin'd. When Man was created, 'tis ſaid, God made Man, but when Woman, He Built her; as if he had been about a Frame of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:172940:32"/>Rooms, and more exact Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Finxit Hominem, Aedificat Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtam;</hi> ſo that Man was but <hi>Figmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> Woman <hi>Aedificum.</hi> If Place can priviledge her, we find her built in Paradiſe; She was form'd on that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ground where Angels reſorted, whenas poor man was made in the open Field with four-footed Beaſts. Thus the Place, Name, and Matter of which ſhe was form'd is more Noble than Man's. 'Tis certain, they are by Conſtitution colder than the Boyling Man, and ſo by conſequence more Temperate; 'tis Heat tranſports Man to Immoderation and Fury; 'tis that which hurries him to a Savage and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidinous Violence. When a Woman grows bold and daring, we ſay ſhe's Impudent, and too like Man; in our ſelves we magnifie what we condemn in her; Is not this Injuſtice? Every Man is ſo much the better, by how much he comes nearer God. Man in nothing is more like God, than in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:172940:32"/>Merciful, yet Woman is far more Merciful than Man, it being a Sex wherein Pitty and Compaſſion hath diſperſed far brighter Rays. God is ſaid to be Love; and Women exceed every where for tranſcending in that Quality. 'Tis Injuſtice then in Men to paſs Sentence upon them before they be heard. They have ever held the Parliament, and enacted what they will, not permitting them to ſpeak; therefore in this Caſe let the Divine <hi>Seneca</hi> be their Advocate, and ſpeak for them;

Beſides, her Matter was not of ſo low an extract as <hi>Adam</hi>'s, but of ſiniſhed Man (whoſe prime materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al was ruder Duſt) was this rare piece made; hence it is, that there is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Eminency of Beauty generally in that Sex than in the other; ſo as what Beauty the World it ſelf contains in ſeverals, ſeems to be contracted in this Model, that all Creatures might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and admire this compleat piece. Nor is it <hi>fabulous,</hi> that Spirits them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have bin enamour'd with ſome Women: We read their Beauty ſpoken of throughout the whole Book of Truth, with more ſignal Obſervations than that of Man.

            <p>Women are made of purer plaſtical Ingredients; there went more refin'd Stuff to their Compoſition than that of Man: for, if Man be of never ſo fine a Paſte, if he waſh his hands in the cleareſt Water, in ſeveral Baſons, never ſo often, yet he will leave ſome
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:172940:36"/>foulneſs and feculencie behind; but a Woman can waſh and leave the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at laſt as clear, fair, and limpid as when it came from the Source or Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain 0 it ſelf in few times waſhing. As to their Modeſty, take this Example; The Daughter of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what moſt ſhamed her to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of, made Anſwer, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:172940:36"/>familiarly as a Wife) they retain this Grace of Modeſty even after Death; for if a Woman be drown'd, ſhe ſwims with her Back-parts upward, the Man with his Belly; but ſuch Caſes as theſe muſt not be argued in the Common Pleas. Nay, the Woman ſwims, the Man ſinks, if they fall into the Water.

               <hi>Fonſeca</hi> is of Opinion, and ſo am I, that there is ſomething in Woman beyond all humane Delight; a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick Virtue, a charming Quality, and powerful Motive to incite Love and Affection. Nay, <hi>Alexander</hi> being much in Love with <hi>Apelles,</hi> as one highly rapt with the Exquiſite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Art, propoſed him that Model for his Task, which he of all others affected moſt, commanding him on a time to paint <hi>Campaſpe,</hi> a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:172940:37"/>Woman, naked: which <hi>Apelles</hi> having done, the Picture wrought ſuch an Impreſſion on his Affection, that <hi>Apelles</hi> fell in Love with her; and <hi>Alexander</hi> perceiving it, beſtow'd it upon him. If ſuch impreſſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Affection draw Life from a Picture, what may be conceiv'd by the Subſtance. To illuſtrate this, there is a Story recorded in the Lives of the Fathers, concerning a Child who was educated in a Deſart from his Infancy, by an old <hi>Eremite.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to Man's Eſtate, he acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſpied two Comely Women, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring in the Woods, and inquir'd of the Aged Father (having never ſeen ſuch Amiable Creatures before in his Life) what they were? The <hi>Eremite</hi> told him they were <hi>Fairies:</hi> (here note by the way, tho <hi>Eremites</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend never ſo much Religion and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctimony, they can now and then ſwallow a Lye without choaking, as well as vitious Perſons) After ſome
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:172940:37"/>tract of Time, being in Diſcourſe, the Old Man demanded of him which was the pleaſanteſt and moſt delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sight that ever he ſaw in his Life? He readily replied, the two <hi>Fairies</hi> he ſaw in the Woods; ſo that indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitably there is in a fair and beautiful Woman a magnetick and natural, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, attractive Faculty, which moves Man to love her.</p>
            <p>But we need not have rambled in the Deſart to prove this, ſince we have a Confirmation thereof at home; An Ambaſſador, who being to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (where the greateſt State was ſtill obſerv'd) firſt paſſed through a Lane of the Guard in their rich Coats, next through the Gentlemen-Pentioners, and ſo through all the greater Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, the Lords, Earls, and Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors. The Queen ſat there in State at the upper end of a long Gallery, which when the Ambaſſador was to enter, the great Ladies, of either ſide,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:172940:38"/>richly attir'd, were placed; through the midſt of whom, as he paſſed along, he, ſo amazed at the State, or admiring at their Beauties, caſt his Eyes firſt on one ſide, then on the other, and that not without ſome Pauſe, as if he had been to take a particular Survey of all their Features; but by degrees coming toward the Queen, who ſat like <hi>Diana</hi> among her Nymphs, or <hi>Ariadne</hi> with her Crown of Stars, inſtated above the leſſer Lights, to give him Entertainment; and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Eye ſtill to wander, thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpake him; <hi>Averte oculos, ne videas vanitatem,</hi> to whom he ſuddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>Imo potius mirabilia opera Dei,</hi> ſuch wonderful Fabricks are Women. And this confirms <hi>Plato</hi>'s Opinion, That Beauty is a humane Splendor amiable in it's own Nature, that has the power to raviſh the Mind with the Eyes. And Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> ſaith, Thoſe that adore or deſpiſe Beauty offer too much or too little to the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:172940:38"/>Image of God; for we as ſeldom find Beauty without Vertue, as Uglineſs without Miſchief: and heretofore deformed Miniſters have been rejected from the Temple; let us not therefore believe ill of Beauty, ſince God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath thought it neceſſary for thoſe that approach his Altars.</p>
            <p>

            <p>In the expreſſion of the Affection, which requires a great meaſure of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, we ſhall find a more rare Temperature in the Feminine Sex; they can ſhadow their reſerv'd Love with a Diſcreet Secreſie, and an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Command (of what Soverani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth moſt in the contrary Sex) decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſeeming grounds of Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: or if they fall in Love, as they are ſubject to Paſſions as well as we,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:172940:39"/>ſo Modeſt they are, that they will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, rather than diſcover their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: witneſs that fair Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, who being Enamor'd with <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, that noble young Prince, and newly ſaluted King, ſhe brake forth into this paſſionate Speech: O that I were worthy of that comely Prince! but my Father being dead, I want Friends to motion ſuch a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. What ſhall I ſay? I am all alone, and dare not open my Mind to any. What if I acquaint my Mother? Baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs forbids. What if ſome Lords? Audacity wants. O that I might but conſer with him! Perhaps in Diſcourſe I might let ſlip ſuch a Word as might diſcover my Intention. Modeſty in Women is like the Angels flaming Sword, to keep vile Men out of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe of their Chaſtity.</p>
            <p>The four Parts of the World had beenloſt for want of a certain Name, and utterly unknown but for Women.</p>

            <p>Marriage,<note place="margin">St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Heb. 13.4. <hi>Smith</hi>'s preparative to Marriage</note> (ſaith the learned Apoſtle of the Gentiles) is Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and well he might; for God
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:172940:40"/>Honoured it himſelf. It is Honourable (as one of our own Divines hath it) for the Author, Time and Place. For the Author, becauſe it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by himſelf, whereas all other Ordinances were appointed of God by the Hands of Men, or Angels. For Time; for it was the firſt ordinance God inſtituted, and that in the ſtate of Innocence, before Man had any other calling, he was call'd to be a Husband; therefore it hath the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Antiquity, becauſe it was the firſt, and conſequently the moſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Ordinance.</p>
            <p>For Place; Marriage was inſtituted in Paradice, in the happieſt Place and ſo hath the honour of Place above all other Ordinances.</p>
            <p>As God the Father Honoured Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, ſo did the Son, not only by his Birth, but Miracles; for the firſt Miracle the bleſted Jeſus wrought, was at a Marriage in <hi>Canaan, John</hi> 2. 6. where he turned Water into
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:172940:40"/>Wine. Nay farther, he honoured it with his Praiſes, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22. 2. for he compareth the Kingdom of God to a wedding, Verſe 11. and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to a wedding Garment; <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic.</hi> 5. 8. Nay, he himſelf is ſaid to be wedded; all which premiſes, if ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and duly conſider'd, do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently and undeniably evince the Honour of a Marriage State, let the ſingle chatter what they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Next, as to the Wife, take her enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Character. A Wife is a Man's beſt Moveable;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sr.</hi> Tho. Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury's <hi>Wife.</hi>
               </note> one that is more than a Friend, leſs then Trouble; a Scions incorporate with the Stock, and equal with him in the Yoke. Nothing pleaſeth her that diſpleaſeth him; She is Relative in all, and he without her is but half himſelf; ſhe frames her Nature to his howſoever. The Hyacinth follows not the Sun more willingly. Stubborneſs and obſtinacy are Flowers, that grow not in her Garden. A Husband with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:172940:41"/>out her is a miſery in Man's Apparel; and if Age hath ſnow'd gray Hairs upon his Head, She is both a Staff and a Chair, to baſe and ſupport him. She is his abſent Hands, Eyes, Ears, and Mouth, his preſent, and abſent all.</p>
            <p>The good Wife never croſſeth her Husband in the Spring tide of his Anger;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fuller's</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly State.</note> but ſtay's till it be ebbing-VVater. Her Carriage is ſo Modeſt, that ſhe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartens VVantons, not only to take, but even beſiege her Chaſtity. Her Children, tho many in number, are none in noiſe; ſteering them with a look, whither ſhe liſteth. A great and eminent: Divine of this Modern Age,<note place="margin">

               </note> a Man ſearcely to be parallel'd for Sanctimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, by twenty ſix Arguments com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends Marriage, as a thing neceſſary for, moſt laudable and fit to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by all ſorts of Perſons: and is perſuaded withall, that no man can live and dye religiouſly, as he ought
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:172940:41"/>to do, without a VVife. Theſe are his very words; <hi>Perſuaſus ſum nemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem poſſe, neque pie vivere, neque bene mori citra <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xorem.</hi> Let all Stale Batchelers that ſeem to boaſt of their Reſolution againſt, and Averſion to ſo ſacred an Ordinance as Matrimony, ruminate on this; He is an Enemy to the Kingdom of Heaven, injurious to himſelf, deſtructive to the VVorld, an Apoſtate to Nature, and a Rebel againſt Heaven and Earth, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines Marriage and leads a ſingle Life.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hebrews</hi> have a ſaying; He is not a Man, that hath not a VVoman, <hi>i.e.</hi> a VVife: for tho Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone may poſſibly be good,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Secker's</hi> wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ring.</note> yet it is not good for Man to be alone. As for the Catholicks, who exact the Virgin ſtate ſo extravagantly; it is like him that commended Faſting, when he was cloy'd with Feaſting. Where there is no Generation, there can be no Regeneration; the Church could not be expatiated without Marriage.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:172940:42"/>It was a Queſtion that one put to him, who ſaid, Marriage Peoples the Earth, but Virginity Heaven; How can the Heaven be full, if the Earth be empty? VVilt thou condemn all for the Faults of one? as if it were true Logic, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome are Evil, therefore none are good. To blaſt thy Helper is to blame thy Maker. Is a ſolitary as good as a married Life? then can one ſtring make as good Harmony as a Conſort. God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to do as his good VVife <hi>Sarah</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. A happy Couple! He joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her, ſhe joying in her ſelf; but in her ſelf, becauſe ſhe enjoyed him. Both increaſed their Riches to each other, each making one Life, double, becauſe they make a double Life, one; where deſire never wanted Satisfaction, nor Satisfaction bred Satiety: He ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, becauſe ſhe would obey; or rather, becauſe ſhe would obey, he <hi>id. ib.</hi> therein ruling. Nature when a Female was firſt born, vow'd her a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:172940:42"/>and as ſhe made her the Child of a Mother, ſo to do her beſt to be Mother of a Child. She gave her Beauty to move Love, VVit to know Love, and an excellent Body to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Love.</p>
