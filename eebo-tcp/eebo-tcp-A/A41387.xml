            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Tract of Logick.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>OGICK hath it's name
from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, because it's
an Art which teacheth to
Reason and Discourse.</p>
            <p>There is a twofold Logick, One Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
which is nothing but natural reason, or
of which every man (that is not an Idiot)
doth in some measure partake: The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Artificial, which is the perfection
of the Natural, <hi>nam Ars perficit naturam:</hi>
this belongeth only to Schollars.</p>
            <p>According to a Threefold Act of the
Understanding, Logick is devided into
Three parts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51282:3"/>
The First treats of Simple or Single
words, in order to the understanding and
best apprehension of Simple things.</p>
            <p>The Second treats of Propositions,
Affirmative, and Negative, wherein one
thing is either denied or affirmed of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
these are called <hi>Voces complexae,</hi> and
the knowledge of them doth direct the
mind in judging what is true, what is
fals; what things may be joyned together
in an Affirmative Proposition, what things
ought to be separated in a Negative.</p>
            <p>The Third part of Logick treats of
several Formes of Argumentation, as of
a <hi>Syllogism, E<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>hyment, Induction, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
Sorites, Dilemma, Violentum;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
us how to Discourse and Argue,
and directing the mind rightly to judge
betwixt a true and fals Consequence, when
the Conclusion doth rightly follow from
the Premisses, when it doth not. For the
better understanding Propositions and
Syllogisms, see the litle Tract of a <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism,</hi>
and <hi>Breerwoods Elem. Log.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The First part of Logick, (as hath been
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51282:3"/>
said,) treats of Simple words, which
are words of the First Notion, as <hi>Homo,
Animal, Brutum, Equus;</hi> or of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Notion, commonly called words of
Art, known only to Schollars. Of these
two sorts of words, the First part of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
Treats; 1, Of certain words of Art,
called Predicables; 2, Of Common
words of the first Notion, called Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>The Predicables shew the manner how
in a Proposition a Predicate is affirmed of
the Subject; whether Essentially or Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally;
whether Necessarily or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingently.</p>
            <p>There are Five Predicables, viz. 1, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
which we call the Common kind;
2, <hi>Species,</hi> which we call the Special kind;
3, <hi>Differentia,</hi> which we call the Difference;
4, <hi>Proprium,</hi> which we call Propriety;
5, <hi>Accident,</hi> which we English an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.
Now every Predicate in every
Proposition is one of these Five. As for
Example, <hi>Petrus est animal; Animal</hi> is
the <hi>Genus,</hi> or the Common kind of <hi>Peter:</hi>
for if you ask what kind of creature <hi>Peter</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:51282:4"/>
is, I answer he is an <hi>Animal</hi> or Sensitive
Creature. <hi>Petrus est homo; homo</hi> is the
<hi>Species</hi> or the special kind of <hi>Peter: Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus
est rationalis; rationalis</hi> is the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
by which <hi>Peter</hi> is distingushed
from a Beast which is unreasonable: <hi>Petrus
est risibilis; risibilis</hi> is the Propriety of
<hi>Peter,</hi> for it is only Proper to a Man to
laugh: <hi>Petrus est albus; albus</hi> is the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
for it is Accidental to <hi>Peter</hi> to be
White, for he may be any other Colour.</p>
            <p>That these Five Predicables may the
better be understood, I will set down their
several Definitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Genus,</hi> or the common kind, is that
which is Predicated of many things, which
do differ in special kinds: as for example,
<hi>Animal</hi> is a <hi>Genus</hi> which is Predicated of
a Man or a Beast, for both are Animals, and
both differ in kind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Species</hi> or the Special kind is that which
is Predicated of things of the same kind,
Differing only in Number, or Singular
Nature; as <hi>Homo</hi> which is Predicated of
each particular Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Differentia</hi> or Difference is that Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51282:4"/>
by which one thing doth differ from
another Essentially, as <hi>Rationale,</hi> which
makes a Man differ from a Beast.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proprium</hi> or the Propriety is a Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
which belongeth to all things of the
one or the same kind, and only to them
and alwaies; as <hi>Risibilitas</hi> which belongeth
to all Men, and only to Men and alwaies to
them, for albeit no Man laughs alwaies
actually, yet every Man hath alwaies the
power to laugh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Accidens,</hi> or an Accident is that which
may be Absent, or Present without the
Destruction of the Subject, wherein it is:
as Cold or Heat is an Accident in respect
of the Water, wherein it may be, or not
be, without destruction of the Water.</p>
            <p>Of Accidents there be two sorts: some
Separable, as Cold in respect of the Water:
others Inseparable, as Heat in respect of
Fire; Blackness in respect of a Crow,
which cannot be really Separated from
Her, but only in conceit: for we may
conceive a Crow to be without Blackness,
without taking any thing from Her Nature
or Essence.</p>
            <p>Having shewed how many things may
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51282:5"/>
be Predicated in a Proposition, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
in the next place I discourse of the
Nature of things themselves.</p>
            <p>All things in the World are generally
reduced to two Heads, Namely <hi>Substances,</hi>
and <hi>Accidents:</hi> for whatsoever is in the
World is a Substance or an Accident.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Magnus Aristotles trutinando cacumina rerum,</l>
               <l>In duo divisit quicquid in orbe fuit.</l>
            </q>
            <p>A Substance is a thing which can subsist
of it self: as an Angel is a Substance: so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
is a Man a Substance, a Horse, a Dog,
briefly whatsoever things you see, are
Substances: yea many things you cannot
see, are Substances; as God, Angels, the
Air, the Wind, are all Substances. If
it be said, I see Colours, as Whiteness in a
Wall, Redness in a Cloud, which are
not Substances but Accidents; I answer,
When I say all things seen are Substances,
I mean not Colours or Figures of things,
but the things under those Colours: as the
Whiteness of a Wall is not a Substance,
but the Wall under that Whiteness.</p>
            <p>In the Second place, an Accident is a
thing which cannot subsist of it self, but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51282:5"/>
is alwaies upheld by some Substance
wherein it resides: as for example; Length,
Breadth, Thickness, any Colour whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
Vice, Virtue, Action, Passion and
divers other things are all Accidents, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding
in Substances: as Vertue or Vice
in a Man, Colour in a Wall, Length or
Breadth in a Table.</p>
            <p>Because this division may seem too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
therefore Logicians use to divide
things into Ten Heads, and to place them
in Ten Rows or Ranks, which they call
the Ten Predicaments; wherefore the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
is Substance, the 2 Quantity, 3 Quality,
4 Relation, 5 Action, 6 Passion, 7 Place,
8 Time, 9 Scituation, 10 Habit, which are
all intimated in these Verses.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Arbor Sex Servos Fervore Refrigerat, Ustos</l>
               <l>Rure Cras Stabo nec Tunicatus ero.</l>
            </q>
            <q>
               <l>A Tree Six Servants Burnt with Heat Refresht,</l>
               <l>To Morrow I'le Stand i'th' Country all Undrest.</l>
            </q>
            <p>In the 1 Rank which is called the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament
of Substance, are placed all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in the world. Now there are several
kinds of Substances, some Incorporeal, as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51282:6"/>
Spirits: some Corporeal, which are
either Simple, as the Heavens, the Sun the
Moon, and Stars; as also the Four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as the Fire, Air, Earth, Water;
or Compounded and made up of these
Four Elements. And these are either In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate,
and without Life, as Stones,
Coals, Silver, Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
as having Life, which are also of
two sorts, some having Life and no Sense,
as Grass, Plants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> others having Life
and Sense: which again are of two sorts;
some having Life, Sense, and Reason as all
Men; others having Life only and Sence,
as Birds, Beasts, Worms, Serpents, and
Fishes.</p>
            <q>All these sorts of Creatures are Substances.</q>
            <p>The Second Predicament is <hi>Quantity.</hi>
In this Rank are placed all Quantities,
whether they be Multitudes, as Numbers;
or Magnitudes, as Length, Breadth, Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Now Logicians call Length, <hi>Linea,</hi>
Breadth, <hi>Superficies,</hi> or Out-Side, Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>Corpus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of Length, or Lines there be Two sorts;
some Straight, others Crooked. A Straight
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51282:6"/>
Line is that which lies directly betwixt
Two Points.</p>
            <p>Of Crooked Lines there be many sorts:
but the chiefest is a Circle or Round Line
drawn Round about a little Point in the
middle, which we call the Centre.</p>
            <p>The Third Predicament is of Quality.
In this Predicament are placed all Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
whereof there are Four kinds; 1, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit;
2, Natural Abilities; 3, Sensible Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities;
4, Figures or Forms.</p>
            <p>1, An Habit is a Quality gotten by Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
and Labour: as the Habit of Discourse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Well, the Habit of Writing Well, of
Harping, Dancing, or the Habit of Justice,
Fortitude, Temperance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
or Vices of the Minde are Habits.
2, Natural Power or Ability is a Quality
Naturally Implanted in us, not purchased
by our Paines or Labour; as the power to
Walk, Speak, See, or Laugh. 3, Sensible
Qualities is whatsoever we See, as all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours:
whatsoever we Hear, as all Sounds:
whatsoever we Tast as all Sapours: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
we Touch, as Heat, Cold, Rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51282:7"/>
Smoothness, Softness, Hardness. 4,
Figure or Form is the outward Fashion of
things; as the Figure of a Man in his Body
or Face, the Figure of a Table which is
Square or Quadrangulate, the Figure of a
Ring which is Round, the Figure of a
Bowl or Globe which is also Round, and
of this Figure is the World which is also
Round, wherein the Earth is placed as a
Center Encircled by the Heavens, and
in Comparison of them it's not bigger
then yonder Center in respect of that
Circle.<note place="margin">

as Similitude or Likeness, is a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
betwixt Two things that are like.</p>
               <p>Every Relative has his Correllative: as
every Father hath a Son or Daughter, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

No Relative is before his Correllative:
as the Father, as he is a Father is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
or Elder then his Eldest Son or
Daughter: for before he had that Child
he was not a Father.</p>

            <p>There is but one thing without Cause,
and that is God. For he being the Cause
of things, was not made or caused by any
thing.</p>
            <p>A Cause is that of which, or by which,
or for which a thing is made.</p>
            <p>There are Four Causes of things, the
Material, the Formal, the Efficient, and
Final, which are in Latine thus Named,
<hi>Materia, Forma, Efficiens, Finis.</hi> The Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51282:8"/>
is the Cause out of which a thing is
made; as the Matter of an House is Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and Stone: the Form is the very Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
and Joyning together of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
the Efficient is the Carpenter: the
Final cause is Habitation; for an House is
made to dwell in.</p>
            <p>Thus the Material Cause or Matter of
a Man is his Body, which is made of the
Four Elements, Earth, Water, Air,
Fire: the Form is his Soul: the Prime
Efficient Cause of a Man is God, though
the Second Cause be his Parents: the End
or Final Cause is Gods Glory; for God
made Man for his own Glory.</p>

the one with the other: some do
dis-agree, &amp; are opposite one to the other,
as Heat and Cold, Black and White, which
are contrary; Light and Darkness, Seeing
and Blindness. Blindness is the Absence
or Privation of Seeing. Now there is a
double Privation of Seeing, the one in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51282:9"/>
part, which is Privation only of the Act of
Seeing; as when you Sleep, you do not
absolutely See: the other is whole or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,

Possibility. Such a Privation of sight is in a
Blind Man, who neither actually Sees
neither can he See.</p>
            <p>If it be demanded whether or no a
Stone be Blind; I answer, It neither Seeth
nor yet is Blind, for albeit there is an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of fight in a Stone, yet there is no
Privation; because that Privation is an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence

as thus, <hi>Homo est Animal.</hi>

            <p>Some Hypothetical made by way of
Supposition as thus.</p>
            <q>Si Homo sit Animal, tum est Corpus.</q>
            <p>Which Proposition consists of two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegorical
ones, the former whereof is
called the Antecedent, the other the
Consequent; both which in the former
instance are joyned together by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
or <hi>Copula (tum) Breerwood</hi> §. 22.</p>
            <p>A Categorical Positive Proposition is
that which consists of a Subject, Predicat
and Copula as thus, <hi>Homo est Animal,</hi>
where <hi>Homo</hi> is the Subject, <hi>est</hi> the Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,
<hi>Animal</hi> the Predicat, See <hi>Breerwood</hi>
§. 5. Note that not every Verb may be a
Copula to a Proposition, but only a Verb
Substantive, as for example <hi>Plato legit
librum,</hi> the Verb (<hi>legit</hi>) is not a Copula,
but the Verb <hi>est</hi> understood, for thus it
should be, <hi>Plato est legens librum,</hi> whence
note that the Copula may be put two
waies in a Proposition, either implicity as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51282:12"/>
thus, (<hi>Plato legit librum</hi>) or expressly as
thus, (<hi>Plato est legens librum</hi>) See <hi>Breer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>
§.</p>
            <p>There be two parts of a Proposition,
Noun and Verb, the Subject is a Noun,
the Predicat is a Verb.</p>
            <p>A Noun is a word signifying <hi>ad placitum</hi>
without time, <hi>finite,</hi> right or of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mininative
case.</p>
            <p>'Tis said to signifie <hi>ad placitum,</hi> or by
Institution, because no true word signifieth
naturally; it signifieth without time (<hi>i.e.</hi>) it
signifies no Difference of time, past,
present, or to come; wherein it is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from a Verb, whose proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is to denote some Difference of time;
'tis said to be finite because it signifieth
some thing certainly, as the word <hi>Homo,</hi>
wherein it is distinguished from infinite, or
indefinite words, as (<hi>non Homo</hi>) which
signifies any thing before a Man.</p>
            <p>Lastly all Nouns in Logick, are <hi>Voces Rectae</hi>
(<hi>i.e.</hi>) of the Nominative case, as <hi>Homo,
Animal,</hi> whence it follows that <hi>hominis,

            <p>HAving spoken of the Substance of a
Proposition, let us descend to it's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,
which are commonly Five,
Quantity, Quality, Opposition, Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollencly,
Conversion.</p>
            <p>First, The Quantity of a Proposition is
Foure-fold, Universal, Particular, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
and Singular.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:51282:13"/>
An Universal is that whose Subject is a
common word, amplifyed by an Universal
Sign, such Universal Sings are <hi>Omnis qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet,
nullus, Un<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>quodque, &amp;c.</hi> as thus,
<hi>Omnis Homo est Animal.</hi> A particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
is that, whose Subject is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
word restrained by a particular Sign,
such as are <hi>quidam, aliquis, &amp;c.</hi> as thus,
<hi>Aliquis Homo est Animal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An Indefinite Proposition, is a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
without an express Sign of Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but 'tis Implicitely, Universal or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p>If the Predicate be necessarily affirmed
of the Subject, then 'tis Universal, as thus,
<hi>Homo est Animal,</hi> is as much as <hi>Omnis
Homo est Animal;</hi> if the Predicate be
but Contingent in respect of the Subject,
then 'tis Particular, as thus. <hi>Homo est
Doctus (i.e.) Aliquis Homo est Doctus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A singular Proposition, Differs little
from a Particular one, as thus <hi>Socrates est
Doctus; His Homo Currit, Breer.</hi> §. 8.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Quality of a Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is either Real or Vocal, the former is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51282:13"/>
two-fold, truth or falsity, as this is a true
Proposition, <hi>Homo est Animal,</hi> this fals,
<hi>Homo est Brutum,</hi> See <hi>Breerwood</hi> §. 10.</p>
            <p>The Vocal Quality called <hi>Qualitas Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calis</hi>
is either Negation or Affirmation,
thence some Propositions are Negative as
thus; <hi>Homo non est equus,</hi> or <hi>nullus Homo
est equus,</hi> See §. 11.</p>
            <p>From the Substance, Quantity, and
Quality, of a Proposition a three-fold
Question, according to this Verse may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Quae, Ca. vel Hyp. qualis? ne vel aff.</l>
               <l>Vn, quanta par, in, sin.</l>
            </q>
            <p>That is if one demand, <hi>quae est Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio?</hi>
of what kind is the Proposition?
you must answer 'tis either Categorical
or Hypothetical, if one demands, <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
est?</hi> you must reply, 'tis either, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,
Particular, Indefinite or Singular;
if one asketh <hi>qualis est?</hi> you must answer
'tis either Negative or Affirmative, See
<hi>Breerwood</hi> §. 12.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Opposition of Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51282:14"/>
is Different in Quantity, or Quality,
or both: There be Four kinds of Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
Propositions, <hi>Contraries, Subcontraries,
Contradictories, Subalterne,</hi> or Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
Contrary Propositions are Two,
Universal ones Differing only in Quality,

            <p>THus much of the Material part of
Argumentation, (viz.) of Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
let us return again to Argumentation
it self.</p>
            <p>Argumentation is the joyning together
of two or more Propositions, by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
Illative, that one may follow from
the other thus.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Homo est Animal: Ergo</l>
               <l>Homo est Sensibilis.</l>

            </p>
            <p>There be four forms of Argumentation,
a Syllogism, an Fnthymem, an Inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
an Example.</p>
            <p>In an Enthymen there be but two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
as thus, <hi>Homo est Animal, Ergo
Homo est Corpus;</hi> In a Syllogism three,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51282:16"/>
and in every one of them a Subject and
a Predicate, which we call Terms, which
are put twice in every Syllogism; so that
Albeit there be in every Syllogism, three
Propositions and in every Proposition two
Terms, yet is there but three Terms in
every true Syllogism, which we call the
Major, the Minor, and Medius; the Major
Terms is put in the Major Proposition, and
Conclusion, the Minor. in the Minor and
Conclusion, the Middle Term in the
Major and Minor, never in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>According to the three Different waies,
wherein the middle Term may be placed
in a Syllogism, there is a three-fold
Figure.</p>
            <p>In the first Figure, the middle Term is
the Subject in the Major, and Predicate
in the Minor; In the second 'tis Predicate
in both Major and Minor; In the third
'tis Subject in them both, whence this vers.</p>

            </q>
            <p>In every one of those Moods, there are
three Vowels, the first whereof stands for
the Major Proposition, the second for the
Minor, the third for the Conclusion, as <hi>in
Ferio, (E</hi>) denotes the Major to be an
Universal Negative, (<hi>I</hi>) the Minor to be
particular Affirmative, (<hi>O</hi>) the Conclusion
to be a particular Negative.</p>

               </gap> because Syllogisms made in the
second or third Figure, are not so perfect

the first Figure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:51282:17"/>
The manner of Reduction, is that Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisms
of the second and third Figure,
are to be reduced to those Moods of the
first Figure, that begin with the same let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as <hi>Bocardo</hi> to <hi>Barbara, Festino</hi> to <hi>Ferio,
Caesar</hi> to <hi>Caelarent,</hi> furthurmore for the
manner of Reduction; we must note that
in these Moods there be four Consonants,
<hi>C. M. P. S.</hi> which express the manner of
converting, or transposing the Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
according to these Veses.</p>
            <q>
               <l>S. vult simpliciter verti, P. vero per Acci.</l>
               <l>M. vult transponi, C. per impossibile duti.</l>
            </q>
            <p>That is <hi>S.</hi> denotes the Proposition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
by the preceeding vowel, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
simply, as in <hi>Caesare, S.</hi> shews how
the Major must be turned simply; <hi>P.</hi>
shews the Proposition designed by the
Precedent vowel, to be converted <hi>per Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidens;</hi>
as in <hi>Darapti</hi> the Minor.</p>
            <p>M. notes a Transposition of the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Proposition, as in <hi>Camestres,</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
must be put in the place of the Minor.</p>
            <p>C. in <hi>Bocardo</hi> notes the Contradiction
of the Conclusion to be made the Major,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51282:18"/>
and its Contradiction the Conclusion, the
Minor remaining.</p>
            <p>There are four general rules to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in every Figure, 1. Both Major,
and Minor, must not be particular, for,
<q>Syllogizari non est ex particulari.</q>
            </p>
            <p>2. Both Major and Minor must not be
Negative, for,
<q>Neve Negativis recte concludere si vis.</q>
            </p>
            <p>3. If either Major or Minor be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
the Conclusion must be particular.
<q>Si qua praeit partis sequitur Conclusio partis.</q>
            </p>
            <p>4. If either be Negative, the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
must be Negative.</p>
