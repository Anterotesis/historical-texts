            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>So then there can be no other definition then this, Shadow is but the imitation of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, not incident to parts cauſed by the interpoſition of a ſubſtance, for, <hi>Umbra non poteſt agere ſine lumine.</hi> And</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:115230:12"/>And it is twofold, cauſed by a twofold motion of light, that is, either from a direct beam of light, which is prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or from a ſecondary, which is reflective: hence it is, that Sun Dials are made where the direct beams can never fall, as on the ſeeling of a Chamber or the like.</p>
               <p>But in vain man ſeeketh after a ſhadow, what then, ſhall we proceed no farther? ſurely not ſo, for <hi>qui ſemper eſt in ſuo officio, is ſemper orat,</hi> for there are no good and lawful actions but doe condeſcend to the glory of God, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially good and lawfull Arts.</p>
               <p>And that ſhadow may appear to be but dependant on light, it is thus proved, <hi>Quod eſt &amp; exiſtit in ſe, id non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtit in alio:</hi> that which is, and ſubſiſteth in it ſelfe, that ſubſiſteth not in another: but ſhadow ſubſiſteth not in it ſelfe, for take away the cauſe, that is light, and you take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the effect, that is ſhadow.</p>
               <p>Hence we alſo obſerve the Sun to be the fountain of light, whoſe daily and occurrent motions doth cauſe an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable luſtre to the glory of God; ſeeing that by him we meaſure out our Times, Seaſons, and Years.</p>

                  <p>Of the World, proving that the Earth poſſeſſeth its own proper place.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have now with the Philoſopher, found out that common place, or place of being, that is, the World, will you know his reaſon? 'tis rendred, <hi>Quia omnia reliqua mundi corpora in ſe includit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I'le tell you of no plurality, not of planetary inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, ſuch as the Lunaries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſt you grabble in darkneſs, in expecting a ſhadow from the light without interpoſition, for can the light really without a ſubſtance be its own Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon? ſurely no, neither can we imagine our earth to be a changing Cynthia, or a Moon to give light to the Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inhabitants: For if our Earth be a light (as ſome would have it) how comes it to paſſe that it is a Gnomon alſo to caſt a ſhadow on the body of the Moon far leſſe then it ſelfe, and ſo by conſequence a greater light cannot ſeem to be darkned on a leſſer or duller light, and if not darkned, no ſhadow can appear?</p>
               <p>But from this common place the World with all its parts, ſhall we deſcend to a ſecond grade of diſtinction, and come now to another, which is a <hi>proprius locus,</hi> and divide it into proper places, conſidering it as it is divided into <hi>Coelum, Solum, Salum,</hi> Heaven, Earth, Sea, we need not ſo far a diſtinction, but to prove that the earth is in its own proper place, I thus reaſon: <hi>Proprius locus eſt qui proxime nullo alio interveniente continet locatum:</hi> but it is certain that nothing can come ſo between the earth as to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115230:13"/>
diſpoſſeſſe it of its place, therefore it poſſeſſeth its proper place, furthermore, <hi>ad quod aliquid movetur, id eſt ejus locus,</hi> to what any thing moves that is its place: but the earth moves not to any other place, as being ſtable in its own proper place.</p>
               <p>And this proper place is the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> to which (as the place of their reſt) all heavie things tend, <hi>in quo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus terminantur,</hi> in which their motion is ended.</p>
               <p>Hence we reaſon, that a Mil-ſtone, or any ponderous thing cannot paſſe the center of the earth, becauſe the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the earth is the fartheſt from the Heavens, for we all know that no man can diſpoſe any heavie thing in the aire to reſt, neither can any one force a ſtone to paſſe through the earth if there were a way perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving paſſed the center of the earth, 'tis as it were to throw aſtone upward which will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain return to its center. For example, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the great Circle ABC D to be the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. cave ſuperficies of the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which all men know to compaſſe the earth on all

ſides, and let the earth be the ſmaller Circle within that, the center whereof is E. Now if a line and plummet at A be let fall towards the earth it will tend in a right line towards E: alſo, if another plummet be let fall from B or any other place as C or D, that will fall alſo in a right line towards E, ſo that they would all meet in the center E, which point they cannot paſſe, for then they return as it were upward, and ſo muſt fall in the Skie or nowhere, contrary to all ponderous motions, whence is proved the earth to be the center of the World, and what manner of center ſhall be ſhewn in the next enſuing Chapter.</p>

                  <p>Shewing how the Earth is to be underſtood to be the Center.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Center is either to be underſtood Geometrically or Optically, either as it is a point, or ſeeming a point.</p>
               <p>If it be a point, it is conceived to be either a center of magnitude, or a center of ponderoſity, or a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of rotundity: if it be a ſeeming point, that is increaſed or diminiſhed according to the ocular aſpect, as being ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time neerer, and ſomtime farther from the thing in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall line, the thing is made more or leſſe apparent.</p>
               <p>A center of magnitude is an equal diſtribution from that point, an equality of diſtribution of the parts, giving to each end alike, and to each a like vicinity to that point or center.</p>
               <p>A center of ponderoſity is ſuch a point in which an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall thing hangs in <hi>equi libra,</hi> in an equall diſtribution
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115230:14"/>
of the weight, though one end be longer or bigger than the other of the quantity of the ponderoſity.</p>
               <p>A center of rotundity is ſuch a center as is the center of a Globe or Circle, being equally diſtant from all places.</p>
               <p>Now the earth is to be underſtood to be ſuch a center as the center of a Globe or Sphear, being equally diſtant from the concave ſuperficies of the Firmament, neither is it to be underſtood to be a center as a point indiviſible, but either comparatively or optically: comparatively in reſpect of the ſuperior Orbs; Optically by reaſon of the far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the one from the earth; as that the fixed Stars being far diſtant ſeeme, by the weakneſſe of the ſenſe, to be conceived as a center indiviſible, when by the force and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of reaſon and demonſtration, they are found to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed this Globe of earth much in magnitude; ſo that what our ſenſe cannot apprehend, muſt be comprehended by reaſon: As in the Circles of the Coeleſtiall Orbs, becauſe they cannot be perceived by ſenſe, yet muſt neceſſarily be imagined to be ſo. Whence it is obſervable, that all Sun Dials, though they ſtand on the ſurface of the earth, doe as truly ſhew the houre as if they ſtood in the center.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Cular obſervations are affirmative demonſtrations, ſo that what is made plain by ſenſe is apparent to reaſon: hence it ſo happeneth, that we imagine the Earth to move as it were on an axis, becauſe, both by ocular
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115230:14"/>
and Inſtrumentall obſervation, in reſpect that by the eye it is obſerved that one place of the Skie is <hi>ſemper apparens,</hi> neither making Coſmicall, Haeliacall or Achronicall riſing or ſetting, but ſtill remaining as a point, as it were, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, about which the whole heavens are turned. Theſe yet are neceſſary to be imagined for the better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the ground of art; for all men know the heavens to be ſupported only by the providence of God. Thus much for the reaſon ſhewing why the World may be imagined to be turned on an Axis, the demonſtration proving that the earth is the center, is thus, not in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining unlikely arguments, but verity of obſervation; for all Gnomons caſting ſhadow on the face of the earth, caſt the like length or equality of ſhadow, they making one &amp; the ſame angle with the earth, the Sun being at one and the ſame angle of height to al the Gnomons. As in example, let the earth be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the ſmall circle within the great circle, marked ABCD, and let a Gnomon ſtand at E of the leſſer Circle, whoſe horizon is the line AC, and let an other gnomon of the ſame length be ſet at I, whoſe horizon
<figure/>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:115230:15"/>
is repreſented by the line BD, now if the Sun be at equall angles of height above theſe two Horizons, namely, at 60 degrees from C to G, and 60 from B to F, the Gnomons ſhall give a like equality of ſhadows, as in example is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. Now from the former appears that the earth is of no other form then round, elſe could it not give equality of ſhadows, neither could it be the center to all the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Orbs: For if you grant not the earth to be the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, this muſt neceſſarily follow, that there is not equality of ſhadow. For <hi>example,</hi> let the great Circle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vens, and the leſſe the earth out of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, now the Sunne being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon AC 60 d. and a gnomon at E caſts his ſhadow from E to F, and if the ſame gnomon of the ſame length doth ſtand till the Sun come to the oppoſite ſide of the Horizon AC, and the Sun being 60 degrees above that Horizon, caſts the ſhadow from E to H, which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall in length; the reaſon of which inequality proves that then it did not ſtand in the center, and the equality of the other proves that it is in the center. Hence is alſo moſt forceably proved that the earth is compleatly round in the reſpect of the heavens, as is ſhewed by the equality
<figure/>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:115230:15"/>
of ſhadows, for if it were not round, one and the ſame gnomon could not give one and the ſame ſhadow, the earth being not compleatly round, as in the enſuing diſcourſe and demonſtration is more plainly handled and made manifeſt.</p>
               <p>And that the earth is round may appeare, firſt, by the Eclipſes, when the ſhadow of the earth appeareth on the body of the Moon, darkning it in whole or in part, and ſuch is the body ſuch is the ſhadow. Again, it appears to be round by the orderly appearing of the Stars, for as men travell farther North or South they diſcover new Stars which they ſaw not before, and loſe the ſight of them they did ſee. As alſo by the riſing or ſetting of the Sun or Stars, which appear not at the ſame time to all Countries, but by difference of Meridians, and by the different obſervations of Eclipſes, appearing ſooner to the Eaſterly Nations then thoſe that are farther Weſt: Neither doe the tops of the higheſt hils, nor the ſinking of the loweſt valleys, though they may ſeeme to make the earth un-even, yet compared with the whole greatneſſe, doe not at all hinder the round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, and is no bigger then a point or pins head in compariſon of the higheſt heavens.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115230:19"/>
the Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South parts of the Horizon. So now if you imagine a Circle to be drawn from the Suns leaving our ſight, through thoſe Azimuth points of heaven, then that Circle there imagined is the Horizon, and is accidentally divided as a man changes his place, and divides the World in a right or oblique Sphear.</p>

               <p>The Aequinoctiall likewiſe divides the World in two equall parts, croſſing at right angles between the two Poles, and is therefore diſtant from each Pole 90 degrees, and is elevated from the Horizon on the contrary ſide of the Poles elevation, ſo much as the Pole wants of 90 deg. elevation, demonſtrated in the Scene by the Circle paſſing from A to B, and is accidentally elevated with the Poles as we change our Horizon, and when the Sun touches this Circle, the dayes and nights are then equall, and to thoſe that live under this Citcle the dayes and nights hang in <hi>equilibra</hi> continually, and the Sun doth move every houre 15 degrees of this Circle, making the houre lines equall, paſſing 15 degrees in one houre, 30 degrees in two houres, 45 degrees in three houres, 60 degrees for four, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing 15 degrees as you increaſe in houres.

               <p>The third ſort of planes are inclining, or rather reclining, whoſe upper face beholds the Zenith, and in that reſpect is called Reclining, but if a Diall be made on the nether ſide, and thereby reſpect the Horizon, it is then called an incliner, ſo that the one is the oppoſite to the other.</p>
               <p>Theſe planes are likewiſe accidentally divided, for they are either direct recliners, reclining from the direct points of Eaſt, Weſt, North; and South, and in this ſort happens the direct Polar and Aequinoctiall planes, as infinite more according to the inclination or reclination of the plane, or they are as erect planes doe become declining recliners, which looke oblique to the Cardinall parts of the World, and obtuſely to the parts they reſpect.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a plane to fall backward from the Zenith, and by conſequence it falls towards the Horizon; then that repreſents a Reclining plane, ſuch you ſhall you ſuppoſe the Aequinoctiall Circle in the figure to repreſent, reclining from the North Southwards 51 degrees from the Zenith, or ſuppoſe the Axis to repreſent a plane lying parallel to it, which falls from the Zenith Northward reclining 38 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, one being Aequinoctiall, the other a Polar plane.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Meridian Line is nothing elſe but a line whoſe outmoſt ends point due North and South, and conſequently lying under the Meridian Circle, and the Sun comming to the Meridian doth then caſt the ſhadow of all things Northward in our Latitude;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115230:23"/>
ſo that a line drawn through the ſhadow of any thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly eraiſed, the Sun being in the Meridian, that line ſo drawn is a Meridian line, the uſe whereof is to place planes in a due ſcituation to their points reſpective, as in the definition of this Circle I ſhewed there was acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall Meridians as many as can be imagined between place and place, which difference of Meridians is the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude, or rather difference of Longitude, which is the ſpace of two Meridians, which ſhews why noon is ſooner to ſome then others.</p>
               <p>The Meridian may be found divers wayes, as moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly by the Mariners compaſſe, but by reaſon the needle hath a point attractive ſubject to errour, and ſo overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the labour, I ceaſe to ſpeake any further.</p>
               <p>It may be found in the night, for when the ſtarre called <hi>Aliot,</hi> ſeems to be over the Pole-ſtarre, they are then true North, the manner of finding it, Mr. <hi>Foſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> hath plainly laid down in his book of Dyalling, performed by a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant, which is the fourth part of a circle, being parted into 90 degrees.</p>
               <p>It may alſo be fouhd as Maſter <hi>Blundevile</hi> in his Booke for the Sea teacheth, being indeed a thing very neceſſary for the Sea, which way is thus: Strike a Circle on a plain Superficies, and raiſe a wire, or ſuch like, in the center to caſt a ſhadow, then obſerve in the forenoon when the ſhadow is ſo that it juſt touches the circumference or edge of the Circle, and there make a mark; doe ſo again in the afternoon, and at the edge where the ſhadow goes out make another mark, between which two marks draw a line; which part in halfe, then from that middle point to the center draw a line which is a true Meridian.</p>
               <p>Or thus, Draw a great many Circles concentricall one
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115230:24"/>
within another, then obſerve by the Circles about noone when the Sun caſts the ſhorteſt ſhadow, and that then ſhall repreſent a true Meridian, the reaſon why you muſt obſerve the length of the ſhadow by circles &amp; not by lines is, becauſe if the Sun have not attained to the true Meridian it wil caſt its ſhadow from a line, and ſo my eye may deceive me, when as by Circles the Sun caſting ſhadow round about, ſtill meetes with one circumference or other, and ſo we may obſerve diligently. Secondly, it is proved that the ſhadow in the Meridian is the ſhorteſt, becauſe the Sun is neereſt the Verticall point. Thirdly, it is proved that it is a true Meridian for this cauſe, the Sun, as all other Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous bodies, caſts his ſhadow diametrically, and ſo being in the South part caſts his ſhadow northward, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a true Meridian.</p>
               <p>But now to finde the declination of a wall, if it be an erect wall draw a perpendicular line, but if it be a declining reclining plane, draw firſt an horizontall line, and then draw a perpendicular to that, and in the perpendicular line ſtrike a Style or ſmall Wyre to make right angles with the plane, then note when the ſhadow of the Style falleth in one line with the perpendicular, and at that inſtant take the altitude of the Sun, and ſo get the Azimuthe reckoned from the South, for that is the true declination of the wall from the South. The diſtance of the Azimuthes from the South, or other points, are mentioned in degrees and minutes in the third Chapter, in the definition of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſorts of planes: or by holding the ſtreight ſide of any thing againſt the wall, as is the long Square ABCD, whoſe edge AB ſuppoſe to be held to a wall, and ſuppoſe again that you hold a thrid and plummet in your hand at E, the Sun ſhining, and it caſt ſhadow the line EF, and at the

               <p>The Sun, though he never moves from the line Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique wherein he hath his annuall or yearly motion, yet
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115230:25"/>
have a declination from the Aequinoctiall North or South, making his diurnall or daily motion, altering the dayes and nights according to all the diverſities thereof: for the Sun being in the Aequinoctiall hath no declination, but in his diurnall motion ſtill declyning from the Aequinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all makes his progreſſe towards the North or South, deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth many parallel Circles, being parallel to the Aequino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall, whoſe fartheſt diſtance from either ſide is 23 deg. 30 minutes, ſo that ſo many degrees that the Sun is diſtant from the Aequinoctiall, ſo much is its declination.</p>
               <p>Now if you imagine the Circle before deſcribed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Meridian Circle which croſſed diametrically, which diameter ſhall repreſent the Aequinoctiall, then lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the greateſt declination, on either ſide of it, drawing two lines at that diſtance, on either ſide of the Aequinoctiall, parallel to it, repreſent the Tropicks, the upper repreſenting the Tropick of Cancer, marked with GE, the other the Tropick of Capricorn, marked with HI: and if from each ſeverall degree you draw parallels too, they doe repreſent the parallels of the Sun, which ſhall ſhew the diurnall motion of the Sun: now if you croſſe theſe parallels with a line from E to H, that then repreſents the Ecliptique; now if you croſſe the Aequino-Ctiall at right angles with another line, that line repreſents the Axis of the World: then if you lay down from the Poles the elevation thereof, to wit, the North and South Poles, according to the elevation of the North Pole down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, where the number of degrees end make a mark; then account the ſame elevation from the South Pole up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and there alſo make a mark, from which two marks draw a right line, which ſhall repreſent your Horizon, and cuts the parallels of the Sun according to the time of his abiding above the Horizon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:115230:26"/>As in example, they that live under the Aequinoctiall have their dayes and nights equall, for under the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall the Poles lie in the Horizon, and have no elevation, ſo that you ſee the Axis AB cuts the Aequinoctiall at right

angles, and then muſt needes cut the parallels of the Sun equall, ſo that the continuing of the Sun above the Poles or Horizon, is equall to his continuance under the Poles or Horizon; ſo that there is repreſented a right Sphear where the dayes and nights are equall. But if the Pole hath ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115230:26"/>
as here at <hi>London,</hi> 51 degrees 30 minutes, then the Horizon is repreſented by CD, where you ſee that then the horizon cuts the parallel of the Sun oblique, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an oblique Sphear, ſo that now the lines grow longer while the Sun declines in them towards the North pole A, then the day is repreſented by the parallel EF, and the night by FG, when the Sun is in his greateſt North decl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſo that you ſee that then in the night the Sun is no lower under the Horizon then from C to G, and then 'tis twi-light all night. Again, the Sun having his greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination towards B the South Pole, then he continues but the arch ID above the Horizon, then the day is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by KI: and the night by HK: Thus you ſee the reaſon of the dayes and nights inequality in an oblique Sphear, and equality in a right, you may likewiſe perceive by thoſe parallels, why the Sun cannot ſhine on all Diall Planes, as we will now ſhew.</p>
               <p>Firſt, An Eaſt and Weſt Diall lies parallel to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, therefore the Sun in the Meridian cannot ſhine on them; nevertheleſſe, though an Eaſt and Weſt Diall cannot have the houre of 12 on it, yet an Eaſt or Weſt poſition may, becauſe it croſſeth the Horizon in the North and South.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A direct North Diall can have but morning and evening houres on it, and then of no uſe but when the Sun hath North declination, for then his Amplitude or diſtance from the Eaſt and Weſt is Northward, and ſo at morning or night ſhines on the face thereof.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A North reclining may ſhew all the houres all the year, if it recline from the North Southward, the quantity of the complement of the leaſt Meridian altitude, but if but the complement of the elevation of the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115230:27"/>
and ſo become a Polar Plane, it can then but ſhew while the Sun is in the North Signes, for the Dyall lying parallel to the Aequinoctiall while the Sun is in South de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination cannot ſhine on the plane becauſe it lies under.</p>
               <p>All upright planes declining from the South may have the houre line of 12, ſo alſo may all North decliners, but not in the Temperate Zone, which is contained between the degrees. South incliners alſo may have the line of 12, whoſe upper face is not below the leaſt Meridian altitude, as alſo if greater then the greateſt Meridian altitude, then doth the upper face want it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, all North recliners reclining more then the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt meridian altitudes complement, may have all the houres but will ſhew but one part of the yeare.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, All South declinets or recliners may have the line of 12 on them. And now having proceeded thus far in ſome theoricall demonſtration or grounds of Dials for the Geometricall projection, we will in the next Chapter lay down the theoricall demonſtration for the Arithmeticall Calculation, and ſo proceed to our practicall way of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as enſueth.</p>

               <p>You may alſo take notice that for the continuall variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Suns greateſt declination it ought to be obſerved by faithful Inſtruments: for as <hi>Orontius</hi> notes that <hi>Claudius, Ptolomie</hi> found it to be 23 degrees 51 minutes and 20 ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds, but in the time of <hi>Albatigine</hi> the ſame number of degrees yet but 35 minutes, <hi>Alcmeon</hi> found it of little leſſe, to wit 33 minutes, <hi>Purbachi</hi> and ſome of his Diſciples doe affirme the ſame to be 23 degrees only 28 minutes, yet <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanes Regiomontan.</hi> in the tables of Directions, hath alotted the minutes to be 30, but ſince <hi>Dominick Maria</hi> an Italian, and <hi>Johannes Varner</hi> of <hi>Norimburg</hi> teſtifie to have found it to be 29 minutes, to which obſervation our works doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly agree.

               <p>Having this greateſt Declination, to finde the preſent Declination is thus, by calculation: As the Radius, is to the Sine of the greateſt Declination; ſo is the Sine of the Suns diſtance from the next Aequinoctiall point, that is <hi>Aries</hi> or <hi>Libra,</hi> to the declination required: wherefore in the Naturall Sines, as in the Rule of Proportion, multiply the ſecond by the third, divide by the firſt, the Quotient is the Sine of the Declination.

                  <p>YOu ſhall firſt on the ſemidiameter of the Horizon, <hi>viz.</hi> AB, deſcribe the arch BC the declination of the plane, and BD the complement of the elevation of the pole, then ſhall you draw the lines AC and AD, and at B you ſhall raiſe the perpendicular DCB.</p>

                  <p>Now if from the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall diagram, or from a Tangent whoſe Radius or ſemidiameter is equal to AB, you prick down the ſeverall Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents of 15, 30, 45, which, as I often repeat, are the ſeveral Aequino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall diſtances for the firſt, ſecond, or third houres from the Meridian or houre line of 6, and at each point raiſe perpendiculars to interſect the lines D and C, they ſhall divide the line DC, ſo as by making a Rombus of the lines AD, AC, they ſhall be the parts to be pricked down from the Meridian and the houre line of 6. Now our example is a South declining Eaſtward 30 degrees, which is here propounded to be drawn: You ſhall firſt draw the perpendicular line and horizontall at right angles one to another, <hi>viz.</hi> the line A and CD.

Now for the placing of the ſtyle you muſt alwayes note that the ſtyle is on the contrary ſide to that quarter where the plane declineth to, &amp; for the line of the ſub<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtyle on which it muſt ſtand, number the length of the line IG, which is the diſtance of the center from the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontall line, in as many equall parts as you pleaſe, as into 5, and at the end thereof draw the line MN perpendicular, then take the diſtance between G and the foot of the ſtyle, and prick down the ſame number of parts; ſo if from the center you draw the line IM it ſhall be the line of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyle, for the ſame proportion as IG to DG, the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion is IN to MN, <hi>as is manifeſt by the fourth propoſition of the 6 Book of Euclide.</hi> On the line of the ſtyle IM, draw in any part the perpendicular OQ equal to the height
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115230:41"/>
of the ſtyle NO, and to which point the line IQ being drawn, ſhall be the axis of the world, then if from Q ſhall be drawn the perpendicular QS, cutting the line of the ſtyle IM in S, giveth the right line from E to S for the Aequinoctiall line, and ſhall be perpendicular to IM if you have performed right. By this propoſition which is laid down in <hi>Clavius</hi> his <hi>deſcriptio Horologiorum,</hi> it is manifeſt that if a ſtyle had ſtood in O, and the length of that ſtyle had been pricked down perpendicular to the point O, as at H, and if from H we had laid down an angle equall to the complement of the declination of the wall, that line would interſect the horizontall line drawn at the foot of the ſtyle at E, and if at R we raiſe a perpendicular, it ſhall interſect the horizontall line at G, to which if I draw a perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar it ſhall be the meridian of the plane, and if I proceed as before, to finde the center of the houre lines which I found at I, it is manifeſt that by this means is made a diall from any point aſſigned, which I leave to your own <hi>genius</hi> till ſomthing more ſhall be ſpoken and written of it by a more able pen.</p>
                  <p>Now good Reader, labour to underſtand my plaine meaning in this, labouring only not to confound thy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory or capacity, &amp; therefore give you alſo to underſtand that ſuch are the houre diſtances of a Weſterly declining plane, as are thoſe of an Eaſterly, only changing the ſide of the plane, and naming it by the complementall houres, the complemental houres I call thoſe that added together make 12, as followeth.</p>

               <p>This Table is in Mr. <hi>Gunters</hi> Book, <hi>page</hi> 240 which if you deſire to have the point of the Equinoctiall for a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontall
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115230:62"/>
plane on the houre of 12, enter the Table of ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows with 38 de. 30 m. and you ſhall finde the length of the ſhadow to be 15 parts 5 m. of the length of the ſtyle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into 12, which prick down on the line of 12 for the Equinoctiall point, from the foot of the ſtyle. So if I deſire the points of the Tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> I finde by this Table that at 12 of the clock the Sun is 62 de. high, with which I enter the Table of ſhadows, finding the length of the ſhadow, which I prick down on the 12 a clock line for the point of the Tropick of <hi>Cancer</hi> at the houre of 12. If for the houre of 1, I deſire the point through which the parallel muſt paſs, looke for the houre of 1 and 11, in this laſt table under <hi>Cancer,</hi> and I finde the Sun to have the height of 59 de. 43 m. with which I enter the table of ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and prick down the length thereof from the bottome of the ſtyle reaching till the other foot of the Compaſſes fall on the houre for which it was intended. Doe ſo in all the other houres, till you have pricked down the points of the parallels of declination, through which points they muſt be drawn Hyperbolically. Proceed thus in the making of a Horizontall Diall, but if it be a direct verticall Diall, you ſhall then take the length of the verticall ſhadow out of the ſaid Table, or work it as an Horizontal plane, only account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the complement of the elevation in ſtead of the whole elevation.</p>
               <p>For a declining plane you may conſider it as a verticall direct in ſome other place, and having found out the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator of the plane and the ſubſtyle, you may proceed in the ſame manner from the foot of the ſtyle, accounting where the ſtyle ſtands to be no other wayes then the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian line or line of 12 in a Horizon whoſe pole is elevated according to the complement height of the ſtyle above
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115230:63"/>
the ſubſtyle, and ſo prick down the length of the ſhadows, from the foot of the ſtyle, on every one of the Houre lines, as if it were a horizontal or Verticall plane.</p>
               <p>But in this you muſt be wary, remembring that you have the height of the ſun calculated for every houre of that Latitude in the entrance of the 12 ſignes, in that Place where your Plane is a Horizontall plane, or otherwayes, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering of it as a horizontall or Verricallplane in another latitude</p>
               <p>For the Azimuths, or verticall circles, ſhewing one what point of the compaſſe the ſun is in every houre of the day it is performed with a great deale of facility, if firſt, when the ſun is in the Equator, we doe know by the laſt Table of the height of the ſun for every houre of the day and by his meridian altitude with the help of the table of ſhadows, find out the Equinoctiall line, whether it be a Horizontall or upright direct plane, for having drawn that line at right angles with the meridian, and having the place of the Style, and length thereof in parts, and the parts of ſhadow to all altitudes of the ſun, being pricked down from the foot of the Style, on the Equinoctiall line, through each of thoſe points draw parallel lines to the meridian, or 12 a clock line on each ſide, which ſhall be the Azimuths, which you muſt have a care how you denominate according to the quarter of heaven in which the ſun is in, for if the Sun be in the eaſterly points, the Azimuths muſt be on the Weſtern ſide of the plane, ſo alſo the morning houres muſt be on the oppoſite ſide.</p>
               <p>There are many other Aſtronomical concluſions that are uſed to be put upon planes, as the diurnall arches, ſhewing the length of the day and night, as alſo the Jewiſh or old

I might heare alſo ſhew you the exceeding uſe of the table of Right and verſed ſhadow in the taking of heights of buildings as it may very wel appear in the ſeverall uſes of the quadrant in <hi>Diggs</hi> his <hi>Pantometria,</hi> &amp; in Mr. <hi>Gunters</hi> qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant, having the parts of right and verſed ſhadow gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated on them, to which Books I refer you.</p>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115230:71"/>
therefore I referre you to other more learned works, and deſiſt to ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>But for matter of Information, I will here inſert cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain definitions taken out of <hi>Optica Agulion ii lib.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſaith he, we call that a light body from whence light doth proceed; truly ſaith he, the definition is plain, and wants not an Expoſitor, ſo ſay I, it matters not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you underſtand the luminous body: only that which doth gliſter by proper brightneſs as doth the Sun, or that which doth not ſhine but by an external overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light, as doth the Moon.</p>
                  <p>2. That we call a <hi>diaphon</hi> body, through which light may paſs, and is the ſame that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> cals perſpicuous.</p>
                  <p>3. It is called <hi>Adiopton,</hi> or <hi>Opacous;</hi> through which the light cannot paſs, ſo ſaith he, you may eaſily collect from a <hi>diaphon</hi> body the definition of ſhadow: for as that is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent through which the light may paſs: ſo alſo is that <hi>opacous,</hi> or of a <hi>denſe</hi> nature wherein the light cannot paſs.</p>
                  <p>4. That is generated from a ſhining body, is called the firſt light, that hath his immediate beginning from the luminous body, it is called the ſecond light, which hath his beginning from the firſt, the third which hath his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the ſecond, and ſo the reſt in the ſame order.</p>
                  <p>Whence we make this diſtinction of day and light, day is but the ſecond light, receiving from the Sun the firſt, ſo that day is light, but the Sun is the light.</p>
                  <p>5. Splendor is light repercuſſed from a pure poliſhed body; and as light is called ſo from the luminous body: ſo this is called ſplendent from the ſplendor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theor.</hi> Light doth not onely proceed from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but from every part of the ſuperficies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Theor.</hi> Light alſo is diſperſed in right lines.</p>

                     </hi> Light diſperſed about every where, doth col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect into a Spherical body.</p>
                  <p>6. The beames of light, ſome are equi diſtant parallels, ſome interſect each other, and ſome diverſly ſhaped. Let A be the Light, a beam from A to B, and another from C to D are parallel, A D and C B interſect; and the other two doe diverſly happen, one aſcending, the other deſcending: its plaine.</p>
                  <figure/>
                  <p>7. That is called a full and perfect ſhadow, to which no beam of light doth come.</p>
                  <p>8. That is called a full and perfect light; which doth proceed from all parts of that which gives light; but that which giveth light but in part, is imperfect: this he exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified by an Eclipſe, the Moon interpoſing her ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Sun and Earth, doth eclipſe the perfect light of the Sun: whereby there appeares but a certaine obſcure, dim, glimmering light, and is ſo made imperfect.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may learn to diſtinguiſh day from night; for day is but the preſence of the Sun by a perfect light re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, which we count from Sun riſing to Sun ſetting.</p>
                  <p>Twy-light is but an imperfect light from the partial ſhining or neighbourhood with Sun: whereas Night is a total deprivation or perfect ſhadow, to which no beam of light doth appettain.</p>
                  <p>Yet from the over-flowing light of the Sun, the Starres are illuminated; yet becauſe ſhadow is always in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, thoſe Stars that are in direct oppoſition to the Sun, are obſcure for that ſeaſon, and hence proceeds the Eclipſe of the Moon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:115230:72"/>Hence it is with the <hi>Sciothericalls</hi> as it is with the Dutch <hi>Emblamiſt,</hi> comparing Love to a Diall, and the Sun with the Motto, <hi>Nil ſine te,</hi> and his compariſon to</p>

Adde alſo, the beam and ſhadow of a gnomon, have one and the ſame termination or ending, toward which I now draw my pen; deſiring you to take notice that the whole Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Dialling, as may appear by the former diſcourſe, doth ſeem to be foure-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> Geometrical, Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical, or by Tables mechanically, or by Obſervation. So that the Art of ſhadowes is no other then a certain and demonſtrative motion of the Heavens in any Plaine or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies, and a Gnomonical Houre is no other then a direct projecting of the hour-lines of any Plain; ſo as that it ſhal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Style ſo to caſt its ſhadow from one line to another, as that it ſhall be juſt the twenty-fourth part of the natural day, which conſiſteth of 24 houres; and this I have laid down after a moſt plain manner following: A gnomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical day is the ſame that the Artificial day is; which the ſhadow of a gnomon maketh from the riſing of the Sun, till the ſetting of the ſame in a concave ſuperficies: which length of the day is alſo projected from the motion of the ſhadow of the Style, a gnomonical Moneth is alſo deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed on Planes, which is the ſpace that the ſhadow of a
