            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Prelates, (whoſe pretended authoritie,
though by ſome publiſhed to be by divine right,
as wee humbly conceive is directly againſt the
ſame) have by their Canons of late, their Fines,

Silencing, Suſpending, Baniſhing, and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating

being notorious incendiaries of the unquietneſſe
and unſettled eſtate betweene theſe Kingdomes,
with many the like; too tedious to relate, as more
fully in our inſuing Grievances doth appeare.
Theſe our cruell Task-maſters have made of us,
who were once a people, to become (as it were)

               <head>A particular of manifold Evils, and heavy preſſures
cauſed, and occaſioned by the Prelacie,
and their dependants.</head>
               <p>1 BEfore they had ſo much as a pretended
Canon, for their warrant the Prelates
urged their Ceremonies with ſuch vehemency,
that divers of our moſt learned and painfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
for not obeying them were Silenced, and
many of us for the like oppreſſed in their Courts.</p>
               <p>2 In the yeare 1634. they made ſuch Canons
and conſtitutions Eccleſiaſticall, as injoyned many
corruptions in the worſhip of God, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church, which exceedingly retar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the worke of reformation to the true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:155279:17"/>
Religion, animated Papiſts, and made way
for divers popiſh ſuperſtitions.</p>
               <p>3 Our moſt painfull, godly, and learned Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
were by the Biſhops and their Commiſſaries
ſilenced and deprived for not Subſcribing and
Conforming to the ſaid unlawfull Canons; yea,
through the hotneſſe of their perſecution forced
to flee the Land, and afterwards Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to the danger of all, and loſſe of ſome of
their lives.</p>
               <p>4 In their places others were obtruded, not
onely ignorant, lazy, and lukewarme, but many
of them unſound in doctrine, prophane in life,
and cruell in perſecution.</p>
               <p>5 Many, though ſufficiently furniſhed, were
not admitted to the miniſtery, onely for not ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
downe their groundleſſe innovations, yea
ſome, though conforme, yet for ſtrictneſſe in life,
were likewiſe kept out.</p>
               <p>6 Good and painfull Miniſters are not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to exerciſe that function which God hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them unto, nor ſuffered to enjoy any living,
whereas the Biſhops doe hold by <hi>Commendum</hi>
many livings, beſides thoſe proper to their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks;
and doe conferre livings upon their
children and retainers, <hi>ſtudendi gratiâ</hi> (as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended)
and divers Benefices, as foure, five, ſixe,
or more upon their favourites; Hence</p>
               <p>7 The cure of ſoules are committed to hyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
who receive 5, 6, 8: or 10. pounds by the
yeare for their cures; Divers of which are put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to the charge of ſome illiterate curate, by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:155279:17"/>
which meanes, the people periſh for want of food,
though the Parſon or Vicat, through connivance
of the Biſhop is utterly non reſident, and by
each one of the many Benefices he injoyeth, hath
a competent allowance for a moderately-minded
man, to maintaine himſelfe and family upon.</p>
               <p>8 Whereas the Biſhops ſhould give all good
example, by painfull preaching and holy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
they preach very rarely themſelves; and
like theſe in the Goſpell, who will neither enter
themſelves, nor ſuffer others to enter, they have
ſuppreſt divers others from preaching, both on
the afternoone on the Lords day, and in many
places where weekly Lectures were maintained,
either by the free-will of the Miniſter, or coſt of
the people, they have utterly forbidden the ſame,
and ſhowne all manner of diſcountenance to
thoſe who were forward therein, ſo that a Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Miniſter appeared before them, under more
prejudice then a popiſh Prieſt, or undermining
Ieſuite;</p>
               <p>9 Leſt thoſe who could not bee admitted into
the miniſtery, undertaking to teach Schoole,
ſhould there lay impreſſions of piety and good
learning, they urge on the very Schoolemaſters a
ſubſcription beyond what is enjoyn'd by their
owne Canon, and puniſh by Excommunication,
and otherwiſe the refuſers thereof; So as the
Schooles formerly much frequented, are now ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
deſolate, to the ſpoyle of youth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
of prophaneneſſe and ignorance.</p>
               <p>10 Thus whiles they proceed ſo ſeverely and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:155279:18"/>
uniuſtly in puniſhing the refuſers to their unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
commands, though otherwiſe never ſo honeſt
and able men, they favour popery to the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and great increaſe thereof; Hence,</p>
               <p>11 Popiſh titulary Biſhops are by them winked
at in the exerciſe of juriſdiction from Forraine
power; Maſſe prieſts are frequent, and pretend a
title to every pariſh in the Kingdome, Maſſes pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
celebrated without controlement, to the
great griefe of Gods people, and increaſe of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
and ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>12 They permit Frieries and Nunneries to bee
within their Dioceſſes, whereby they continue
and increaſe of late in many places, yea divers of
them ſuffered to remaine in the very places where
ſome of the Biſhops have their ſpeciall reſidence.</p>
               <p>13 In many places of the Land where Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
are forbidden and reſtrain'd, Papiſts are
permitted to keepe Schooles; unto ſome whereof
ſuch multitudes of children and young men doe
reſort, that they may be eſteemed rather Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities,
teaching therein not onely the tongues, but
likewiſe the liberall Arts and Sciences.</p>
               <p>14 They ſet forth and ſuffer to bee publiſhed
wicked Libells and ungodly Pamphlets, tending
to ſedition, faction, and diſunion of the Brittiſh
Inhabitants, ſuch as <hi>Examen conjurationis Scoticae,
Lyſimachus, Nicanor,</hi> &amp;c. And in their Sermons,
Prayers, and ordinary Table-talke, divers of the
Biſhops in matters quite beſides their Calling,
have not deſiſted to rayle, curſe, and moſt bitterly
inveigh againſt the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:155279:18"/>
all their proceedings labouring to make them odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
thereby proving themſelves firebrands of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
betweene the two Nations; yea, proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
their prophanneſſe by drinking healths to
the confuſion of that Nation.</p>
               <p>15 The moſt learned and ſeemingly mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and pious of the prelates, publikely in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
at <hi>Dublin,</hi> exclaimed againſt, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Scottiſh Covenant and Religion profeſt
in that Kingdome with moſt invective tearmes;
And in the Starre-chamber in <hi>Dublin,</hi> at the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of <hi>Henry Stewart</hi> Eſquire, his Wife and two
Daughters, and <hi>Iames Gray,</hi> for refuſing to take
an oath, for which there was no other ground
then the Earle of <hi>Straffords</hi> command, which
was againſt the Covenant of <hi>Scotland,</hi> uttered theſe
words; <q>
                     <hi>Theſe people with</hi> Corah, Dathan, <hi>and</hi>
Abiram, <hi>doe withstand the ordinance of God, and
therefore I leave them to the judgement of</hi> Corah,
Dathan, <hi>and</hi> Abiram.</q>
               </p>
               <p>16 They have frequently made Symonicall
pactions and bargaines in the conferring of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices,
and ordinarily permit Miniſters to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
their livings, thereby to nullifie Leaſes of
tithes, which the former incumbent Miniſters
have let at certaine rates.</p>
               <p>17 The Prelates have uſually appointed ſuch
men to be their Commiſſaries, Officials, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters,
who altogether neglecting the puniſhment
of vices cognizable in their Courts looke onely
to their owne gaine; Hence</p>
               <p>18 Though they pretend themſelves the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancers
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:155279:19"/>
of vertue, and puniſhers of vice, yet they
uſually without further ſatisfaction abſolve the
moſt ſcandalous perſons for aſumme of money,
and often queſtion not at all ſuch from whom
they privately before-hand receive ſuch a ſumme,
which is a cauſe that many wickedneſſes doe more
and more abound.</p>
               <p>20 If any bee preſented by their Apparitors
(who are uſually Papiſts) if it bee but for non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paiment
of the Clerkes groat, or not obſerving
ſome one of their moſt frivolous injunctions; yea,
though the party preſented bee not found culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
yet they require moſt exceſſive and unjuſt
fees; And if their demands bee not ſatisfied,
(though never ſo great poverty might plead for
mercy) they preſently proceed to the cenſure of
excommunication, thus vainely and blaſphemouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
abuſing the high ordinance of God, ſo many
hundreds of us remaine under that cenſure, and
multitudes conſtrained to run out of the Land, to
the undoing of them and theirs.</p>
               <p>21 The Prelats that they might manage <hi>Peters</hi>
ſword aſwell as his keyes have ſome of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
that moſt unlawfull Writ of aſſiſtance,
whereby his Majeſties Officers and Miniſters are
required to yeeld aſſiſtance unto the Biſhop his
Officiall, or any deputed by him; which Writ is
by their Officers moſt notoriouſly abuſed, and
many times put into the hands of their Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
who under colour thereof apprehend ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
men and women, caſting them into priſon,
untill they be forced to free themſelves by an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
compoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:155279:19"/>
21 They charge Churchwardens with Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
farre beyond their underſtanding; to every
particular whereof, if they refuſe to anſwer or
preſent, then are they bound to anſwer for it at
Councell table, or high Commiſſion court, or
both, and though there acquitted, yet no remedy
left them for their great damages.</p>
               <p>22 They force Churchwardens to attend all
their viſitation and circular Courts; And there,
for their Articles, Oathes, Admiſſions, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges,
they make them pay moſt exceſſive and
undue fees, never before practiſed or required.</p>
               <p>23 The communications for penance, which
either ſhould not be at all, or if exacted, then ſet
apart for the poore, and other pious uſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
either to the Prelates kitchin, and Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
purſe, or both;</p>
               <p>24 The Prelates and their faction, as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite
then ſuperſtition of the Payacy, ſo of late
they exact with all ſeverity the abſolute cuſtomes
of S. <hi>Mary-gallous,</hi> Mortuaries, Portions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which as they were given by ſuperſtition and uſed
to Idolatry, ſo now they are taken by oppreſſion
and applied to riotouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>25 They have alſo conſtantly practiſed and
ſuffered, the buying and ſelling of the Sacraments,
which is an heavy burden; And where the poore
have not to pay the Miniſter and Clerkes fees,
they will not marry them, nor ſuffer their dead to
be buried.</p>
               <p>26 In the high Commiſſion court againſt all
law and equitie, they ſit as Iudges in their owne
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:155279:20"/>
cauſe, and take Cognizance of the higheſt and
ſmalleſt matters, going therein without controll;
Hence</p>
               <p>27 In the ſaid Court they uſurpe with an high
hand the judicature of civill cauſes, impoſe Fines,
beyond all bounds, and impriſon at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
whereby many have beene utterly undone.</p>
               <p>28 They proceed in the ſaid Court, by way
of moſt cruell and lawleſſe inquiſition, not onely
into mens actions and words, but reaching even
to their very thoughts, in impoſing that moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
oath <hi>Ex officio,</hi> to force to accuſe, not
onely others, but likewiſe their owne ſelves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to law, and the very maximees of nature;
And if any refuſe to take this oath, then are they
impriſoned, and fined beyond meaſure, to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of all that fall under the weight of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.</p>
               <p>29 Divers of the Prelates did joyntly frame
and wickedly contrive with the Earle of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
that moſt lawleſſe and ſcandalous oath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
upon the Scottiſh-Brittiſh among us, who
were Proteſtants, for receiving all commands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely;
And ſome of the Prelates were the
occaſion, that women and maids ſhould be forced
thereunto; Hence Commiſſions iſſuing to all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for the exacting of it, they were perſecuted
with ſo much rigour, that very many as if they
had beene traytours in the higheſt degree, were
ſearched for, apprehended, examined, reviled,
threatned, impriſoned, fettered together by threes
and foures in Iron yoakes, ſome in chaines car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

up to <hi>Dublin,</hi> in Starre-chamber fined in
thouſands beyond abilitie, and condemned to
perpetuall impriſonment; Divers poore women
but two dayes before delivery of children were
apprehended, threatned, and terrified; others of
them two or three dayes after child-birth, ſo
narrowly ſearched for, that they were faine to
flee out of all harbour, into woods, mountaines,
caves, and corne-fields, and many dayes and
nights together abſent themſelves, to the impay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the health of very many, the death of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and loſſe of their goods, which the enemy
at their pleaſure made havocke of. Theſe, with
many more unexpreſſible, have beene the wofull
effects of the Oath drawne up by advice of the
Prelates, and ſo unjuſtly preſt by authority of the
Earle of <hi>Strafford.</hi>

               <p>30 The Prelates with their faction have beene
injurious, not onely to the ſpirituall, but alſo to
the temporall eſtates of moſt men; for under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of Church lands they have injuriouſly
ſeized into their hands, much of the beſt lands in
every County, ſo that there is ſcarce a Gentleman
of any worth, whom they have not bereaved of
ſome part of his inheritance, few daring to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
their unjuſt demands; and if any did, yet
none able to maintaine their juſt titles, againſt
their power and oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>31 By their wayes have they enivated and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
many families, deſtroyed and caſt away
thouſands of ſoules, and moreover in their owne
perſons have beene a ſcandall to the Goſpell, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:155279:21"/>
a ſtumbling blocke even to the common enemy,
by their ſwearing, curſing, drunkenneſſe, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-breaking,
&amp;c. having ſuch ſervants uſually
in their Families, as are the moſt prophane in the
Kingdome, few others countenanced by them,
but ſuch, and if any ſeeme to be of an holy life,
he is ſcorned and perſecuted by them.</p>
