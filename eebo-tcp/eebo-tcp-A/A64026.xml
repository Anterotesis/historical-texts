            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>SInce I had the Honour, Sir, of entertaining you with a Dumb Language, that the <hi>Turks</hi> uſe to Expreſs without Speaking, without Writing, and without Seeing one another, the ſtrongeſt of all the Paſſions. You
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99165:6"/>
have been exceedingly preſſing in obliging me to put in Writing that which I had Communicated to you in a familiar Converſation. You extreamly puſle me in it, and I aſſure you that I had beg'd your excuſe, had I but known the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt a particular Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of two Perſons in which all freedom is admitted, and from whence all Affectation is baniſh'd, and a ſtuddied Diſcourſe, which peradventure you will publiſh, and ſo cauſe it to be Criticis'd, in its Phraſe, Method, Words, and in all Things elſe which thoſe that Write are oblig'd to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</p>
                  <p>I am not Ignorant of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard I run, I prepare my ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the troubleſome conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, that my temerity will draw on me. You are oblig'd to maintain my Reputation, ſeeing you have firſt engag'd me to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your Curioſity, without giving
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99165:6"/>
me the leaſure of reflecting on the difficulty of my enterpriſe. And if Love is counted the Shipwrack of Liberties and Hearts, he may well be that of my Pen alſo. Be it what it will, ſpare me, I pray you, and expoſe not this ſmall Peice to the public, who will not prove ſo kind as you are, and that will not conſider, that my deſign is but to Divert you in a manner of making Love, which is wholly new.</p>
                  <p>There are divers ways of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing that Paſſion. The firſt School in that, is that of Nature, and all thoſe Leſſons which the Poets have given us on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, would remain very uſeleſs without the Aid and Aſſiſtance of this Univerſal School Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs.</p>
                  <p>Though the Love of the Brutes is neceſſary to the Conſervation of their Species, Nature has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it the ſeaſoning of ſome
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99165:7"/>
preparatory Agreements, to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the Senſes and to ſtir up the Natural Heat.</p>
                  <p>Man, the moſt rational and ſenſual of Animals, finds the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure too ſhort, and endeavours to prolong it, by new Inventions, he ſets to work all ſorts of Means, to expreſs unto the belov'd object, what he makes us to feel, and theſe Troubles which he cauſes in a Lovers Heart; who ſometimes expreſſes himſelf with the Voice, who employs Writing to ſet forth in the moſt moving Manner that Ardor which conſumes him, and who in defect of Voice and Writing endeavours to expreſs by the different Motions of his Face the Sentiments of his Heart.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the uſual ways of making Love in a Country of Freedom, where Communication is eaſily obtain'd, and where Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can See, Speak, and Write to one another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:99165:7"/>There are Nation that enjoy not thoſe advantages. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the <hi>Turks</hi> can neither Write, nor Read, neither have they the freedom of Converſing with Women; yet are they not inſenſible. On the contrary it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the Eaſtern People are more apt to Love then any other Nation; They wholly Abandon themſelves to it, there they fix their ſovereign good, they raiſe their Paſſion even to a Fury, and I have ſeen ſome in their Rage to Stab their Limbs with D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ggers, and then to drop burning Brimſtone in the Wounds.</p>
                  <p>There is no wonder therefore that People of ſo Hot Tempers, when they want the ordinary means of making known their Paſſion, endeavour to invent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ones. Flowers, Leaves, Fruits, Aromatick Woods, Gold, Silver, all Colours, Stuffs, and in fine, almoſt all things that are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99165:8"/>
in the Commerce of Life, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in that of Love.</p>
                  <p>All thoſe things which the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Selam's,</hi> Salutes, have their ſignification, and their Natural or Allegorical Valour, much like the Old way of Poetry, ſo that a little packet about the bigneſs of a Thumb does form by the ſeveral things which it contains, a very expreſſive Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>This way of Expreſſing a Paſſion, will appear to you as extravagant as new. Yet it wants not its A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements alſo, and though it proceeds but from a great want of Liberty, and a defect in the moſt Common of Arts, which is that of Writing and Reading, yet it is ſo Gallant and Ingenious, that thoſe that can both Write and Read, make uſe of it alſo, and believe that thoſe <hi>Selams,</hi> have more force and make a greater impreſſion on the mind, then the Characters of a Letter.</p>

                  <head>A Gallant and True HISTORY.</head>
                  <p>IT is the Cuſtom amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> to paſs the three Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Days of the <hi>Bayram,</hi> in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic rejoycings. Thoſe Sultaneſſes that have their particular Palaces in the City of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and near unto it, go to the <hi>Seraglio</hi> to Viſit the Sultaneſſes, which at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times are not ſeen. There they paſs theſe three days, in Sports, Feaſts and Dances.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe amongſt the Slaves, that are not Employ'd in Singing or Dancing, which makes the Chief Divertiſement of the Princes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire themſelves in ſome Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where they Sport amongſt themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:99165:21"/>One day that <hi>Bournaz Atidgé,</hi> the Sultaneſs, Siſter to <hi>Sultan Morat,</hi> was at the <hi>Seraglio</hi> with <hi>Tarhain</hi> Sultaneſs <hi>Validé,</hi> Mother to the Grand Segnior now Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thoſe two Sultaneſſes who were very good Friends, being deſirous to entertain themſelves in Private, diſmiſs'd their Slaves.</p>
                  <p>Some of them very good friends, ſeparated themſelves from the reſt, that they might with more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom entertain one another. They turn'd their Converſation on the Love of <hi>Gulbeas</hi> white roſe. She was the principal Slave of the Sultaneſs <hi>Validé</hi>; That Maid, at firſt made ſome reſiſtance, either through Modeſty, or to ſpare her ſelf the Sorrow of the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of a Beloved Lover. Yet ſhe yeilded at laſt to her Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions Importunities.</p>
                  <p>She told them that ſhe had paſs'd divers years without knowing what was Love, though ſhe daily
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99165:21"/>
heard her Companions Diſcourſe of that Paſſion; which produced ſuch ſtrange Effects in thoſe Maids mind, that ſhe could perceive them to paſs in an inſtant, from joy to ſadneſs, and from Love to their Jealouſy, and Deſire, and that Faces would change as frequently as their Hearts were agitated with different Paſſions: That ſo Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Condition had caus'd her to fear ſuch like Engagements, and that ſhe had ſhun'd them as much as ſhe could: But at laſt, ſaid ſhe, Love anger'd at my reſiſtance, forc'd me to yeild to his Power, and inſpired in me ſome Feelings of Tenderneſs for a Young <hi>Turk,</hi> Neighbour to a <hi>Jew,</hi> with whom I Boarded, to Learn the Exerciſes of Reading, Writing, Singing, Playing on Divers Inſtruments, and Dancing, in Order to be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the <hi>Seraglio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Turk</hi> named <hi>Iſſouf,</hi> Son to <hi>Mahomet</hi> Baſſa, was both Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99165:22"/>
and good Friend to the <hi>Jew,</hi> and he did frequently come to his Houſe, to hear me Sing. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd ſo ſtrong a Paſſion for me, that he paſs'd both Days and Nights at his Window, or in his Garden to ſee me: And one day, he ventur'd to ſpake to me of his Love, but his Diſcourſes made ſo ſmall Impreſſion on my mind, that I had not at that time the leaſt Sentiment of Tenderneſs for him.</p>
                  <p>Sometime after that Perſon who had put me to the <hi>Jew,</hi> finding me ſufficiently Inſtructed, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented me to the Sultaneſs my Miſtriſs. Abſence, which is a great Remedy againſt Love, inſtead of alaying <hi>Iſſoufs</hi> Paſſion, ſerv'd but to increaſe it, while I liv'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt diſturbance in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> where Love had not yet diſturb'd my Reſt.</p>
                  <p>He did endeavour by all ſorts of means to learn ſome News of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99165:22"/>
the Perſon he lov'd; all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours were fruitleſs, The Gates of the Womens Apartment are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible places. Thoſe Cerbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſes that keep them, enraged and deſperate to find themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of that which might render them agreeable to ſo many Beauties which they have under their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, become Jealous, and have more Eyes then <hi>Argus</hi> to examine all their Actions.</p>
                  <p>So many difficulties had a moſt repuls'd <hi>Iſſouf,</hi> who had conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated three years in fruitleſs At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts. He did Abandon himſelf to Grief and complaining, when one of his Friends who ſhar'd in his Sorrow, inform'd him that a Jewiſh Woman Merchant, named <hi>Boullaſter,</hi> had free Acceſs in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> where ſhe ſold a great many J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>wels to the Sultaneſſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iſſouf</hi> who had Wit, and Means, made good uſe of his Friends Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and built great Hopes on it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99165:23"/>
perſwaded that Money over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes all difficulties, and that Liberality moves the moſt obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Hearts. He reſolv'd to confide his Love to this Jewiſh Woman, and to engage her in his Concerns.</p>
                  <p>The Enterpriſe was not very difficult, conſiderable Preſents, and Promiſes of Reiterating them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a favourable Succeſs, did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Jewiſh Woman to ſerve <hi>Iſſouf</hi> in his Amours.</p>
                  <p>He put into her hands a Pair of Pendants of Emeralds cut in the ſhape of Pairs, a pair of Diamond Bracelets, and the Buckles of a Girdle ſet with Rubies, in Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel'd Gold. He Accompanyed this Preſent with a Billet, and a Seliman, put up in a Watch Caſe of Enamel'd Gold, ſet with Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds. He Conjur'd his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to uſe all her Induſtry to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade and convince me of the exceſs of his Love, and to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to me the Diſorders which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99165:23"/>
that Paſſion had made in his Heart, the deplorable Condition in which it had reduc'd him, that I had been almoſt three years in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and could not all that while learn any News of me, that he was ready to Dye if all that he had ſuffer'd for me was not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to molifie me, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire ſome kindneſs for him in my Breaſt.</p>
                  <p>The Jewiſh Woman, who was very Dextrous and Prudent, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Seraglio</hi> as ſhe us'd to do, took her time when the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs was not viſible, and ſeeking of an opportunity of ſpeaking to me conveniently, requeſted that I ſhould give her leave to reſt her ſelf a while in my Apartment, which I could not in Civility re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe her, I being ſhe which this Jewiſh Merchant beſt knew, by reaſon of my Place of Treaſurer to the Sultaneſs, to which I had been advanc'd, in a ſhort time,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99165:24"/>
through the Sultaneſſes ſingular Bounty.</p>
                  <p>Women are naturally Curious, I inform'd my ſelf of the quality of her Jewels. She heightned their Beauties and Perfections, pulling out of her Boſom a box in which thoſe things were put up, ſhe ſhew'd them me.</p>
                  <p>The fires and ſparklings of thoſe precious Stones, on which I moſt earneſtly gaz'd, with an envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Eye, invited me to put them on me for a while.</p>
                  <p>The Jewiſh Woman, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that I was coming to the Lure, and that this dreſs pleas'd me, did invite me with her praiſes to frequently Conſult a ſmall Looking-glaſs which I had found by chance, which made me ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an extraordinary redneſs on my Face, caus'd by a Vexation, that Fortune had not favour'd me, with ſuch a like Treaſure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:99165:24"/>
                     <hi>Boulluſter</hi> who eaſily perceiv'd what paſs'd in my Heart, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that every moment was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, thought it high time to Play her Part, and to diſcover to me <hi>Iſſoufs</hi> Paſſion in giving me his Letter and Preſent.</p>
                  <p>Charming <hi>Gulbeas,</hi> ſaid ſhe, I muſt confeſs to you how much I am ſurpris'd that the Sultan is not yet taken with your Beauty, and with ſo many Graces which I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in your Face; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in you but what is capable to Produce Love, and if that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror had once ſeen you in this Dreſs, the Sultaneſs would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome Jealouſie thereon, and I eaſily believe what has been told me of the Paſſion of a Young <hi>Turk</hi> whoſe Name is <hi>Iſſouf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though I had not heard him mention'd ſince I had been Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> no more then of the <hi>Jew</hi> with whom I had

liv'd, that Name made me change Colour, for that young Man's Paſſion was not unknown to me, ſeeing he had entertain'd me with it before. I did all I could to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe my Surpriſal, and to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the Motions of my Soul, but that Poiſon that had thrown it ſelf there and ſo long fomented, without perceiving it, diſcover'd it ſelf againſt my will by a Sigh drawn from the bottom of my Heart, which I could not for my Life retain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Boullaſter</hi> made ſo good uſe of the diſorder in which ſhe perceiv'd me to be, and made me ſo lively a draft of <hi>Iſſoufs</hi> Paſſion, and Merit, that laying aſide her indifferency in that buſineſs, ſhe made an end of engaging me, in preſenting me with the Box of Diamonds. I thought at firſt that it had been a Watch: My Curioſity invited me to open it, but in lieu of a Watch Movement I found in it a Billet.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99165:25"/>
Honour made me immediately ſhut it up again, and return it to the Woman. I Counterfeited the Angry Body, yet would I gladly have been inform'd of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of that Billet, not doubting but that it was <hi>Iſſouf's,</hi> Declaration of Love, who began to pleaſe me. The Jewiſh Woman who had too much of Experience not to diſcern my feigning, did Preſs me to take the Box, I did it proteſting it was meerly in Complaiſance, and to free me from her Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities.</p>
                  <p>I pulling out the Billet found under it a little Packet which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd a Selam, but becauſe I can Read well, I inſtantly open'd the Billet, which was expreſs'd in theſe Terms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To See and to Love you Divine Gulbeas have been to me the ſame thing. The Gods who have made you ſo Fair, ought to have made you
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99165:26"/>
more ſenſible alſo, or not have poſſeſs'd we with ſo much Love, and ſo little of hopes. My Paſſion is as Ancient as the knowledge which I have had of your Merit, and Time which Conſumes all things has ſerv'd but to increaſe it. There are paſs'd divers years ſince I am no more my ſelf, and that I live but for you. I paſs both days and nights in that part of the Garden, where I did hear you Sing, and Play on your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and from whence I did ſometimes ſpake to you. That place once the Confident of my Delights, is now the ſame of my Sorrow, and will ſoon be that of my Death, if you cauſe not my Deſtiny to alter, not being any longer capable of Life without ſeeing you. I am not Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the difficulty of the Attempt; but moſt Incomparable Beauty, if you will afford me but a little pitty, who Languiſhes for you, and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of caſting my ſelf down at your Feet, leave all the reſt to Prudent</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:99165:26"/>
Boullaſters <hi>Cares, ſhe will know how to manage my Bliſs and your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reading of this Billet gave me the Curioſity of unfolding the Selam. It was Compos'd of a grain of Grape, a little Race of Ginger, a ſmall piece of Cole, and Alum, lapp'd up in white and yellow Silk, which ſignified as follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I wiſh, My Eyes, that you were perfectly inform'd of that Love which I feel for you. It deprives me of my ſelf, and if you take not pitty of the Condition I am in, I ſhall Dye while you will enjoy an happy Life: Honour me with an Anſwer, and put an end to my ſufferings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though I feign'd not to be well pleas'd at this Declaration which I thought ſomething too free, my Heart was very well ſatisfied with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99165:27"/>
                     <hi>Iſſoufs</hi> Conſtancy. It ſpoke to me in his hehalf, and there needed not any great effects to perſwade me of his Love, and to inſpire in me ſome tenderneſs towards him.</p>
                  <p>The Jewiſh Woman, who ſtudied my Countenance, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Effects of the Letter, and of the Selam, did preſently offer me the Jewels with which I was already adorn'd. My reaſon, which was not yet wholly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd, made me to refuſe them, and to Repreſent to her the wrong which it might do to my Reputation, ſhould the Sultaneſs diſcover it, and that I could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a preſent that would be the cauſe of my Ruine. At the ſame time I undid thoſe Jewels which I return'd her with the Box, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining nothing but the Letter and the Selam.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Boullaſter</hi> who a long Practice had render'd expert, was of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that ſometimes a too great
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99165:27"/>
earneſtneſs, does impede the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs which is moſt deſir'd, did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to convince me by a means to which I could make no reſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>She told me that my Beauty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Aſſiſted with ſo powerful an Addition, I might pleaſe the Grand Segnior, and peradventure be made Sultaneſs. The Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Reigning, at leaſt in an Emperors Heart, carried it above my Reaſon, and made me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to receive the Preſent.</p>
                  <p>She would gladly have had me as ready to have receiv'd <hi>Iſſouf</hi> in my Appartment: My Heart did not reject the propoſition, had not my reaſon render'd me inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Finally after long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and reiterated intreaties, I conſented to ſee him in the Garden.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Boullaſter</hi> could have wiſh'd (to acquit her ſelf handſomly of her Commiſſion) that I had given her
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99165:28"/>
an Anſwer; Honour and Reaſon oppos'd it, but Love did engage me to let him know by a Selam, that his Paſſion was not unpleaſing to me, it was lapp'd up in an Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kercheif of Silk Embroider'd with Gold, wrought with my own Hand, after which the Woman retir'd, pretending before my Companions, who had ſurpris'd us in the Converſation, that ſhe left thoſe Jewels with me, that I might ſhew them to the Sultaneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iſſouf</hi> impatient to learn the ſucceſs of his enterpriſe expected his Agents return, who made him an exact Relation of all that had paſs'd, and gave him that Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kercheif which I had ſent him.</p>
                  <p>The Joy which he reſented at the receit of this aſſurance of the acceptance of his Paſſion, did Tranſport him in ſuch manner, that without examining what it contain'd, he kiſs'd it a thouſand times, and water'd it with his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99165:28"/>
Tears, with the moſt tender Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, that Love could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Boullaſter</hi> who would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt him during the height of his Tranſport, when he was come to himſelf again a little, made him to take Notice of the Selam. It was <hi>Iſabella</hi> Silk, a Sprig of <hi>Jeſſemy,</hi> a little bit of Spunge, ſome Time, and ſome Mirtle.</p>
                  <p>I cannot expreſs to you the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Joy which <hi>Iſſouf</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd at it, it was ſo great that he was ſtruck Speechleſs, and that Rapture had laſted longer, if <hi>Boullaster,</hi> as Curious, as he was Contented, had not preſs'd him to give her the Expoſition of it. <hi>I accept your Vows,</hi> ſaid the Selam, <hi>be perſwaded of my Constancy, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided you be ſo I pray Heaven to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow you on me, and that our Souls may be inſeparably joyn'd together.</hi>

Then Addreſſing himſelf to the Selam, and you Dumb Mouth, will you aſſure me the duration of her new Born Love?</p>
                  <p>He had ſaid more; but all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were Precious to prepare himſelf for this Enterview.</p>
                  <p>The difficulty of this enterpriſe did caſt him in a new Sorrow, and plung'd him in a Melancholy more profound then the former. He was in a diſpair of finding in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> a Friend ſo faithful as to be truſted with his Amours, and his Impatiency did increaſe, ſtill as he grew nearer the ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:99165:29"/>After he had much Tormented himſelf on the means of bringing about his deſign, he remembred that there was a Maſter Gardner nam'd, <hi>Ouſta Mehemet,</hi> who was greatly oblig'd to his Father, and that that conſideration, might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him to do him Service, he reſolv'd to find him out.</p>

                     <hi>Ouſta Mehemet,</hi> who had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd for <hi>Iſſouf</hi> a natural Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, receiv'd him with Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of a perfect Friendſhip, and great proteſtations of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments of the good Offices which he had receiv'd from the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> his Father.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Iſſouf</hi> was ſatisfied of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemets</hi> fidelity, and that he doubted not but that though he ſhould not grant him the favour which he was about to ask of him, that he would however keep his ſecret, he however exacted from him an Oath, on the Head of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, never to reveal that which

                  <p>
                     <hi>Iſſouf</hi> diſcovered his Paſſion to his Friend in ſuch ſenſible Terms, and ſo preſſing, that though he had not had any mind to ſerve him, it was no longer in his power to refuſe him. <hi>I Love, moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Mehemet, <hi>but what ſerves my Love, when that I cannot ſpake to the Object of my Vows.

My Dear</hi> Mehemet, <hi>muſt facilitate the entry of it to me, on you depends the ſucceſs of this Enterpriſe; I have Built on your Friendſhip; and if ever you have lov'd, you will judge of the Importancy of the Service, and the greatneſs of the Obligation, that I ſhall be indebted to you for it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Declaration had made too great an Impreſſion on this Old Mans Mind, the remembrance of thoſe Diſorders which a like Paſſion had formerly Caus'd in his Breaſt, did make him conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend with eaſe to <hi>Iſſoufs</hi> requeſt, without conſidering the danger unto which he expos'd himſelf, ſhould the intreague be diſcover'd. He promiſed to introduce him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Gardiners habit, and that he had no more to do, but to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my appointed time.</p>

I promiſs'd her that the next day at nine I would render my ſelf in alow room which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99165:31"/>
anſwer'd on the Garden, and which was parted from it but by a Lattice Window, of which I ſhould open a ſmall wicket, which would be the ſign of my coming, that that was the moſt favourable time, that the Sultaneſs did uſually reſt, and her Women alſo, after break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſts; and that all the Eunuchs were on the outſide of the Gate, to prevent all noiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iſſouf</hi> had like to have dyed, at the receit of this news, which did cauſe him ſome reſtleſſneſs, through the apprehenſions that his ill Fortune might make him miſcarry in this attempt. He paſs'd the whole night with terrible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, mixt of fear and hope.</p>
                  <p>He render'd himſelf at the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio,</hi> at the appointed hour. <hi>Mehemet</hi> caus'd him to change his rich habit for a Gardiners dreſs, made of a courſe red Serge, with a cap a Foot long, of the ſame
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99165:32"/>
Stuff. He put a Spade in his hand, and conducted him to the Garden ordering him to dig a border juſt under the Windows of that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment; at every ſtroke the new Gardner would lift up his Eyes, to obſerve whither the wicket did open; but unluckily, the Sultaneſs being fallen aſleep a little latter then uſually, the Gardner had leaſure to dig almoſt all the border, before I could come to the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouz.</p>
                  <p>He was very impatient, as I was inform'd, he would ſome time hear your great flyes, which ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for paſſage would ſtrike againſt the Lattice, which made him fancy that I was looking and laughing at his ſlavery.</p>
                  <p>When I came near the Window, and that through the Lattice, I perceiv'd <hi>Iſſouf</hi> with the Spade in his hand, I no longer doubted of the ſtrength of his love, and though it was a little uneaſy to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99165:32"/>
me to ſee a Perſon of his Quality digging of the ground, to enjoy one moment the ſatisfaction of ſeeing me, it gave me a ſecret joy, and without reflecting on what my abſence might make him to ſuffer, I took a great delight in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of him without ſhewing my ſelf. But he having work'd a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time, and that ſo harſh an exerciſe to ſo tender a Body, did oblige him, to reſt often on his Spade, and to caſt up his Eyes from time to time on the place where I was to appear, I open'd the wicket, and ſaw <hi>Iſſoufs</hi> Pain to redouble, the Spade fell out of his hands, he remain'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out motion, like a ſtatue, but by good Fortune he was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, <hi>Mehemet</hi> who had forſeen the conſequences of this firſt ſight, had ſet the Gardners at ſome diſtance, who were to have work'd in the ſame place.</p>
                  <p>There is no greater trouble,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99165:33"/>
then to be in preſence of that one loves, and not in power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare ones grief. That which <hi>Iſſouf</hi> did ſuffer by being depriv'd of ſpeaking to me becauſe of the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Sultaneſs's appartment, was as troubleſom to me as to himſelf, and notwithſtanding all the reſervedneſs which I pretended to, I ſuffered no leſs then he did. By good Fortune the Dumb Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which is very much us'd in this Court, and that we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly underſtood, did ſo well ſupply the defects of our Voices, that we ſeparated well ſatisfied with one another. The Eyes, the motions of the face, the ſigns of the Fingers, and the geſtures of the Body, did all ſpeak more then the moſt fluent tongue could have utter'd, which is frequently Dumb in ſuch occaſions, and ſays nothing at all for having too much to ſay. We did ſo pleaſe our ſelves in this converſation, that it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99165:33"/>
had continu'd longer, if I had not heard ſome treading in the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneſs's</hi> appartment, which oblig'd me to make ſigns to <hi>Iſſouf</hi> to retire; and ſo I ſhut the wicket.</p>
                  <p>During all our intreagues, <hi>Boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſter,</hi> who was now the confident of our mutual amours, made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Journeys to the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> I took no leſs delight at the news of my lovely <hi>Iſſouf,</hi> then he did of his dear <hi>Gulbeas.</hi> He was very rich, and did promiſe me to uſe all his Endeavours, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all his Friends, to get me out of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and to marry me. This had not doubtleſs deceiv'd my hopes, if a precipitated Death caus'd by the Plague had not depriv'd me of my only Joy.</p>
                  <p>Sobbs and ſighs, mix'd with Tears, interrupted <hi>Gulbea's</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and the ſtrength of her grief having diſenabled her from finiſhing, ſhe intreated one of her Companions, to whom ſhe

                  <p>Their Paſſions grew beyond all limits, <hi>Iſſouf,</hi> who was impatient at his Incomparable Miſtriſs's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, would attempt a ſecond enterview, in which he might freely, with a loud Voice and not by Dumb ſigns expreſs the exceſs of his love. He communicated his deſign to his confident, reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting large promiſes if ſhe had good ſucceſs. She being won by the gains, did engage to omit nothing that might tend to his ſatisfaction.</p>

They were ſo many Ages to the Amorous <hi>Iſſouf,</hi> for whom neat and proper Cloths were getting ready that his dreſs anſwering to the Beauty of his Face, where no Hair had yet appear'd the Guards might be with more eaſe impos'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>The 4<hi>th.</hi> day <hi>Boullaſter,</hi> and her pretended Daughter whom we will call <hi>Gevaher,</hi> which in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Language ſignifies, Precious-Stone, came to the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99165:36"/>
                     <hi>Seraglio.</hi> This She-Merchant who was well known, having told that who accompany'd her was her Daughter, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Black Eunuchs, who let them both enter.</p>
                  <p>Here <hi>Patma</hi> made a pauſe, and beginning again with a languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accent, ſhe ſaid, <hi>Iſſouf, what doſt thou doe? you come to ſee Gulbeas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you ſeek in her Eyes for a remedy to your Evils, you are going to find the end of them but after a very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner, your preſence ſhall cure her of the Plague which overcomes her, and by a ſtrange counter-blow, you will take in, in approaching her, a Poyſon, that ſhall kill you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of truth, continued ſhe, The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Woman did introduce the fair <hi>Gevaher,</hi> into the dying <hi>Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bea's</hi> Chamber. Judge of the trouble that <hi>Iſſouf</hi> found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in, and if the ſurpriſal of ſuch an unexpected accident were not capable of breaking all
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99165:36"/>
the meaſures of this diſguiſe.</p>
                  <p>There little wanted but that he diſcover'd himſelf, but <hi>Gulbeas</hi> who ſtill preſerv'd a ſound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the rigour of her diſeaſe, which was at the third day, did intreat her companions, to leave her one moment alone with this <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Woman, to ſettle ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts which they had together.</p>
                  <p>When that <hi>Iſſouf</hi> found himſelf alone near <hi>Gulbeas,</hi> he gave full ſcope to his grief, and forgeting the place he was in, he tore of his vail, and cleav'd to the Beds Head of the ſick Perſon, who he bathed with his Tears not being able to ſpeak one word. <hi>Gulbeas</hi> on her ſide did receive ſuch preſſing ſtrokes of love, with the anguiſh of her diſeaſe, that it cauſing a great revolution in her Body, a Chriſis was produc'd, which ſaved her life, and gave <hi>Iſſouf</hi> his death who could not be perſwaded to quit the Boulſter, where he took in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99165:37"/>
the ſteam of a Malignant ſweat, which peirc'd him to the very Heart, and caus'd him to fall in a fainting Fit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Boullaster</hi> ſtrangly confus'd at the ſwooning of her pretended Daughter, and much more at the conſequences that the unraveling of this intreague might produce in caſe that the illneſs increaſing, ſhe had been oblig'd to be put into a bed, call'd me to aſſiſt her.</p>
                  <p>When I came in, the feigned <hi>Gevaher</hi> began to breath and to ſigh, turning her Eyes towards <hi>Gulbeas,</hi> whoſe name ſhe ſpoke with ſuch a tender and amourous accent, that I wonder how I perceiv'd it not, I reflected not on it, and did attribute it to an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent acquaintance, that which was a pure effect of love.</p>
                  <p>It paſs'd not ſo with <hi>Boullaſter,</hi> ſhe was ſo ſurpris'd that all her ſenſes fled from her, and her face grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pale ſhe fell in a ſwoon, ſo that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99165:37"/>
I was left alone very buſy, and concern'd. I brought the Daughter near to <hi>Gulbeas</hi>'s Bed, and run to the Mother who was not long fainted, when both were recover'd of their ſwoon, I went to prepare ſomething for them to take.</p>
                  <p>The Amorous <hi>Iſſouf</hi> made uſe of that moment to ſay ſome few things to his Miſtriſs, which he pronounc'd with a Languiſhing Voice. Death, <hi>which perſues me,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is a leſs trouble to me, adorable</hi> Gulbeas, <hi>then the pain which I feel for what you endure. I ſhould run to it with Pleaſure, if I thought it would eaſe you, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of it, and that I had rather dye, then abandon you, If I did not expoſe you, by my ſtay here to a danger greater then your Diſeaſe. I retire, but I retire to dye, not being able to reſist ſo much ſorrow. Gulbeas</hi> overcome with the ſtrength of her diſeaſe, peirc'd to the quick at <hi>Iſſoufs</hi> illneſs, and weakned with
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99165:38"/>
the violence of her Criſis, could not anſwer thoſe tender aſſurances but with Tears, which made her faint away. Here it was that Poor <hi>Iſſouf</hi> had need of his whole ſtock of reaſon, to reſiſt ſo much Grief, and yet Act nothing that might betray the ſecret, he was forc'd to reſt contented with ſighs, which were attributed to his late fainting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gulbeas</hi> was long in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and beginning to Breath again, <hi>Boullaſter</hi> who fear'd ſome new accident, endeavour'd all ſhe could to bring back <hi>Iſſouf,</hi> from his afflicted Miſtriſs.</p>
                  <p>He could not reſolve on ſuch a ſad ſeparation, which he foreſaw would be eternal; He would fain have expir'd near what he lov'd, yet he was forc'd to obey his Miſtriſs's orders, who made ſigns to him, not being able to ſpake, and gave him her hand, which he kiſs'd, proteſting that he would not out live her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:99165:38"/>All thoſe accidents which had accompanyed ſo ſad an enterview, was not ſufficient to overcome our unfortunate Lovers. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd that paſſing by one of the doors of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> where there ſtands <hi>Baltadges,</hi> which are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain varlets from without, that one of them diſtruſting the feigned <hi>Gevahers</hi> going, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come careleſs through her grief and pain; fancy'd it a diſguiſe, and ſtop'd <hi>Iſſouf</hi> by the arm; <hi>Boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſter,</hi> whoſe Wit was always at hand, without ſpeaking to the <hi>Baltadgj,</hi> for fear of bringing more to them, drawing near, dropt into his hand a ring which ſhe pull'd of her own Finger, and preſſing his hand ſhe thereby oblig'd him to give liberty to this poor Lover to get out, who thought much leſs on the preſent accident then on <hi>Gulbea's</hi> troubles.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as <hi>Iſſouf</hi> was return'd to his Palace, he went to his Bed,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99165:39"/>
his Feaver increas'd, and finding himſelf preſs'd with that diſeaſe which kill'd him, he would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy that little time he had to live, in taking leave of his dear Miſtriſs, and to give her his laſt farewell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I dye for you, Incomparable</hi> Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas, <hi>and Death is the more pleaſing to me, becauſe I hope that its Cauſe which was your Criſis, will be that of the prolongation of your days. I ſhould dye without trouble, had I the certain news of it. The diſeaſe preſſes upon me, and I employ that little time which is left me, in giving you teſtimonies of a love which I ſhall carry to my grave: happy if that laſt moment can better convince you then divers Years of Sighs and Tears have done. Adieu, all lovely, live and remember that the ſame love which reſtores you to Life is the Cauſe of my Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No ſooner had he ended his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:99165:39"/>
Letter, but he immediately ſent it with the Ring on his Finger, in which his Miſtriſs's name and his were Ingraven on a very clear Ruby, to <hi>Boullaſter,</hi> and was preſently ſeis'd with a diſturbance in his head, and a redoubling of his Feaver, which depriv'd him of his Senſes and Speech, which never return'd again but with the laſt ſigh, which he vented, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the lovely name of his Miſtriſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gulbeas,</hi> whoſe Criſis had put out of all Danger, the ſweat having Diſſipated the Tumors of the Plague, was more Diſtemper'd in the Mind then the Body, <hi>Iſſouf's</hi> ſilence, and <hi>Boullaſter's</hi> ſtay from giving her an Account of all that had paſs'd, ſince their parting, did ſtrangly Perplex her, and giving her ſad Warnings of what was coming, ſhe felt moſt mortal diſquiets, ſhe would Weep all
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99165:40"/>
Day, and the Night was paſs'd in Watchings, or in Terrible Viſions, which foretold her nothing but thoſe Dangers which ſhe fear'd. The ſame night that <hi>Iſſouf</hi> expir'd, ſhe thought that a Woman of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious height, as Lean as a Skelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and of a frightful Deformity, her Hairs ſpread abroad approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her with the Face of a Fury, a great Knif in her Hand, was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her ſide, and pulling out her Heart. All thoſe Nocturnal Viſions, Augmented her Sorrows. She had made Choice of me for her Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ever ſince <hi>Iſſouf's</hi> adventure, I did endeavour to Divert her, and turn her off of all thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Thoughts, nothing could Adminiſter Comfort to her; But it was much worſs, when <hi>Boullaſter</hi> came to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> ſome days after <hi>Iſsoufs</hi> Death, to acquit her ſelf of the laſt Commiſſion, which he had given her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:99165:40"/>So ſoon as ſhe did ſee her, ſhe earneſtly Inform'd her ſelf of <hi>Iſſouf's</hi> welfare; but the Jewiſh Woman's ſilence, who could not diſſemble, nor keep in her Tears, gave her eaſily to underſtand that truth which ſhe fear'd to learn, Ah! Cry'd ſhe, <hi>Iſſouf</hi> is no longer in being! and preſently fell in my Arms in a Swoon.</p>
                  <p>When ſhe was come to her ſelf again, <hi>Iſſouf's</hi> Letter and Ring which <hi>Boullaſter</hi> put into her Hands, not being able to ſpeak one word, did Confirm that Sorrowful News, She Divers times kiſs'd thoſe dear Pledges of <hi>Iſſouf's</hi> eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, Water'd them with her Tears, and did hang the Ring at her Neck, as a Mark that ſhe Devouted her ſelf to her Lover's Ghoſt; and having remain'd ſometime without Speech, her Face from Pale as it was, became Red, and as if ſhe were become Furious.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99165:41"/>
                     <hi>Fatal Deſtiny,</hi> cry'd ſhe, <hi>thou Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders me my Life in killing what I Love, and thou ſelleſt me very dear, that which I can no longer Love, ſeeing that he, with whom I deſign'd to ſhare it, is no more. Why didſt thou not kill me, or why didſt thou Conduct him here, that I might be further oblig'd to him of my Life? after ſo many Services ſo ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, I will no longer Live after ſuch an Accident; Alas! what will Life ſignifie to me, after that he, who Animated me is Dead. No</hi> Iſſouf, <hi>I deſign'd not to Live but for you, and I ſhould be unworthy of your Love ſhould I have any other thoughts. That Death which was to have taken me off, has not ſpared me, in taking of you. It has doubly ſlain me in depriving me of what I Love, and permitting me to Linger out a Miſerable Life, which ſhall be but a Continual Death. You Live</hi> Iſſouf, <hi>and your most happy ſhade, enjoys at preſent the Pleaſures of the</hi> Eliſicum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields,

                     <hi>and I ſhall never ceaſe Dying till I am reunited to you. Then Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing her ſelf to the Ring. This Ring, continu'd ſhe, ſhall be henceforth the Faithful witneſs of my Love, and ſeeing it could not <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite our Bodies during our Lives, it ſhall be the indiſſo lubbiletye of our Wills, and the Mark with which I will appear before you, I will continually wear it in my Boſom, and it ſhall Accompany me in my Grave, ſeeing you could not have any other thought, when you ſent it me at your Death, than that of uniting me more ſtrictly to you in the other World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She had continu'd, and gone on further with her Complaints, if the preſence of our Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, had not interrupted their Courſe and oblig'd <hi>Boullaſter</hi> to retreat.

                  <head>TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>TO give an advantageous Character of this Novel, there needed but to name the Perſon that Compos'd it. The great Succeſs which all the Ingenious Works which, She has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, have had, would be ſufficient to put an Eſteem on this, and none can doubt of its worth after the great Approbations that have been given to all the rest. But in this Particular I am not Permitted to Satisfie the Curioſity of the Publick. Her Will oppoſes it ſelf unto that Glory that She might juſtly pretend from it, and She does reſt ſatisfied with the bare Secret Delight which She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, in that which She Pro<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ares to the Ingenious. Yet I believe not that all Her Cautiouſneſs can Conceal Her from the knowing. The Nicety
<pb facs="tcp:99165:44"/>
of the Sentiments, the Towr of the Conceptions, the clear and eaſie Stile, all does here Conſpire to Her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. The Virtue of three as Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious as Unfortunate Perſons, which Vye with one another who ſhall moſt overcome themſelves in Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Souls, Produces in the Heart ſuch Motions of Tenderneſs and of Pitty as do extreamly Delight. The Character of that Nation, which makes the Subject of this Novel, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſo Natural that it will not be Difficult to Believe the Truth of the Principal Events. Thoſe that have Read the <hi>Portugal</hi> Hyſtory, will agree to it, and I need not make any stay here to Prove it. I ſhall only ſay, that if an Ingenious Fiction, has Power to exite and stir up our Paſſions, a Truth ſo well Penn'd, as this is, will not fail of moving the leaſt ſenſible Perſons, and to draw ſuch Tears from them, as they would gladly let fall.</p>

                  <p>THough Love promiſes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Pleaſures, the Effects of it are ſometimes ſad. A Tender hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not ſufficient to attain to a Perfect Happineſs; and that <hi>Capricious</hi> Fortune which croſſes all things, has but very little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Paſſionate Hearts, when She is in the Humour of producing ſtrange Adventures.</p>
                  <p>Divers Examples of the paſs'd Ages prove the Certainty of this Maxim; But the Reign of <hi>Don, Alfonſe,</hi> the 4<hi>th.</hi> of that Name King of <hi>Portugal</hi> does furniſh us with one the moſt Extraordinary.</p>
                  <p>He was the Son of that <hi>Don Denis,</hi> whoſe Enterpriſes did ſo well ſucceed, that it was ſaid of

                  <p>To that end he fix'd the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his Son <hi>Don Pedre,</hi> who was but eight years old, with <hi>Blanch</hi> Daughter to <hi>Don Pedre,</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> who the Young Prince did Marry at ſixteeen. She brought along with her at <hi>Coimbria</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Infirmities, and but a few Agreements. <hi>Don Pedre</hi> who had a ſtock of Mildneſs and of Bounty, notwithſtanding all thoſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, did live in good intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with her; But at laſt thoſe inconveniences being degenerated into a <hi>Paralitic</hi> Diſtemper, and <hi>Blanch</hi> herſelf being deſirous of a retreat the <hi>Pope</hi> did annul the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.

                     <hi>Conſtantia</hi> had been promiſed to the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi>; but he break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Word, ſhe was given to a young Prince, who was once to reign over a conſiderable number of fair Provinces. He was but in his twenty fifth year, and the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt Man of all <hi>Spain</hi>: with the moſt advantageous Qualities of the Body, he poſſeſt thoſe of the Soul, and in all things, he did prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf worthy of that Crown, which was appointed for him.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſs <hi>Conſtantia</hi> was Beautiful, Spirituous, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as much as any Woman in the World, her Merit ought to have Captivated <hi>Don Pedre,</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he had for her an Eſteem mix'd with reſpect; which might have paſs'd for Love with the leſs

Penetrating Perſons. Mean time his more real Flames were reſerv'd for another Beauty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> brought forth a Son in the firſt Year of her Marriage; who was Named <hi>Don Louis,</hi> and who ſcarce had the time to diſcern the light; The loſs of him did cauſe her to feel many Sorrows; but that cold indifferency which ſhe obſerv'd in thoſe Cares which her Husband did beſtow on her, was much more ſenſible to her.

                  <p>At firſt ſhe thought ſhe had deceived herſelf; but time having confirm'd what ſhe fear'd, ſhe did ſecretly ſigh for it, and had ſo much

Conſideration for the Prince as to give him but ſome obliging marks of her Sorrow, which ſhe could not Conceal from <hi>Agnes de Caſtro,</hi> who lived with her, and the Princeſs Affection did diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh her from all the other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                  <p>This Maiden ſo dear to the Princeſs, did well deſerve that preference which ſhe gave her. She was exceſſively Beautiful, wiſe, diſcreet, Spirituous, and more Affectionate for <hi>Conſtantia</hi> then ſhe was for her own Intereſt, having left her Family, whoſe name was <hi>Illuſtrious,</hi> and that did hold a very Conſiderable rank, to give her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wholly to the Princeſs, and to follow her into <hi>Portugal.</hi> It was in her boſom that ſhe poured forth her firſt Sorrow, and the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>Agnes</hi> omitted nothing that could Adminiſter Comfort to her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conſtantia</hi> was not the only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which Complained of <hi>Don

                  <p>Her Jealouſy left her not long i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; ſhe examin'd all the Prince's Actions, and without difficulty did unravel the Cauſe of that indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, which he had for his Spouſe: But that did not bring him back to her, and it was with great preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, that ſhe miſtruſted ſome new Paſſion in him, which ſhe promiſed to her ſelf to thwart ſo ſoon a<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

raiſe ſuch a pride in her, that all the Princes indifferency was not capable to humble.</p>
                  <p>He did languiſh, and none could gueſs at the Cauſe, he had no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger any reliſh for public Sports, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary converſations were uneaſy, and ſolitude only had ſome power over him; this change ſurpris'd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body, Don <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> who lov'd his Son, deſign'd to diſcourſe him about it; but the Prince gave no other Anſwer, than, that it was an effect of his Temper.</p>
                  <p>All this while, time did paſs, and the Princeſs was deliver'd of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son, who liv'd and was nam'd <hi>Ferdinando.</hi> Don <hi>Pedre</hi> did force himſelf a little to ta<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#PDCC" extent="2+ letters">

                  <p>The plotting <hi>Elvira</hi> was inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly agitated, in ſeeking after the Knowledg of his Secret. Chance
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99165:48"/>
labour'd for her in it. One day, that ſhe was walking of her fury in the Palace's Gardens, ſhe found the Prince of <hi>Portugal</hi> aſleep in an obſcure <hi>Grotto.</hi> Her Fury could not hold againſt that Object. She caſt her Eyes on him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that in ſpight of ſleep ſome Tears did ſteal from his Eyes. That ſhare which he ſtill had in her heart, had no hard task to ſoften it; but ſhe heard him ſigh, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to expreſs theſe ill articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Words: Yes, divine <hi>Agnes,</hi> I will dye before I diſcover it, and <hi>Conſtantia</hi> ſhall have no Cauſe to reproach you any thing. <hi>Elvira</hi> was ſeis'd with horror at that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which preſently repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her Imagination <hi>Agnes de Caſtro</hi> with all her charms, and not doubting but that it was ſhe who poſſeſt Don <hi>Pedre</hi>'s heart, ſhe felt more hatred againſt that Rival, than ſhe had of Tenderneſs for him. The <hi>Grotto</hi> was no ſit place to make Reflections in, and to form

deſigns. Perhaps that her firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port had caus'd her to have awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Prince, had ſhe not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd under his hand a Paper, which ſhe ſeis'd, and that ſhe might not be ſurpris'd reading of it, ſhe went forth with as much diligence as emotion.</p>
                  <p>When ſhe was got to her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe open'd the Paper trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and in it found theſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes writ with Don <hi>Pedre</hi>'s own hand, which it is likely he had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compos'd.</p>

                     <hi>Elvira</hi> knew well <hi>Don Pedre's</hi> Writing, and was not Ignorant that he made Verſes, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ſad part that <hi>Hymen</hi> Acted in thoſe which was fallen into her hands, She Scrupled not to produce them to the Princeſs: That ſhe might not be ſuſpected, She appeared not in the leaſt; but it being not ſufficient to cauſe <hi>Conſtantia</hi> to obſerve how little her Husband Lov'd her, and that it was neceſſary alſo, to inform her, that he was become <hi>Agnes de Castros,</hi> Slave, <hi>Elvira</hi> caus'd theſe few Words, in an Unknown Hand, to be Writ under the Princes Verſes, where there was a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſpace.</p>

                     <hi>Elvira</hi> did not much ſtick on the Nicety of Poetry in the laſt Verſes, and provided, they had
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99165:49"/>
but the Effect which ſhe wiſh'd for, ſhe requir'd no more.</p>
                  <p>Her Impatiency would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her to ſtay till the next day to Publiſh them. She went to the Princeſs Apartment, who was gone forth to walk, and paſſing to her very Cloſet without being perceiv'd, ſhe conveyed the Paper in a Book which the Princeſs did uſually read, and Retired very well ſatisfy'd with her good Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as <hi>Conſtantia</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, ſhe went into her Cloſet, where ſhe found the Book open and in it thoſe Verſes that ſhould coſt her ſo dear. The Prince's Character was well known to her; but beſides the cruel Confirmation of all that ſhe had feared, ſhe learn'd that it was <hi>Agnes</hi> of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> whoſe ſole Friendſhip could conſolate her Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who was the cauſe of it. She did Read an hundred times over the ſame thing, ſeeking to belye her own Eyes and Reaſon; but perceiving too well that ſhe was not deceiv'd,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99165:50"/>
and conſulting her Thoughts on this Adventure, ſhe found her ſelf much more poſſeſt with Sorrow then with Anger, when ſhe conſider'd that <hi>Don Pedre</hi> as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous as he was, had ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd his Love in Secrecy. After having pittyed him without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, her natural tenderneſs did cauſe her to ſhed a deluge of Tears, and did inſpire her with the deſign of concealing all her Grief.</p>
                  <p>She had certainly done it by the Power of an Extraordinary Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, had not the Prince enter'd with extream haſt, he miſſing his Verſes at his awaking, and fearing they ſhould light into Indiſcreet Hands, he came into the Palace diſturb'd with this Loſs, came to <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> obſerv'd her Humid Eyes, and ſtay'd his own on thoſe unlucky Verſes, which had newly eſcap'd from his Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>He preſently grew Pale, and appear'd ſo Concern'd that the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99165:50"/>
Generous Princes was more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his then of her own Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune: Madam, ſaid he, with Amazement, whence have you that Paper? It cannot come but from ſome Enemy of your quiet and mine, reply'd <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> it is the Work of your own Hand, My Lord, and doubtleſs of the Motion of your Heart alſo; but fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if my Tenderneſs would make it paſs for a Crime, that ſame Tenderneſs which nothing can alter, would prevent it in me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conſtantia's</hi> Moderation did ſerve but to render the Prince more Confounded. How Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous you are Madam continu'd he, and how Unfortunate am I! Some Tears did Accompany thoſe Words, and the Princeſs who Paſſionately Lov'd him, was ſo ſenſibly mov'd with them that for along ſpace they both remain'd Mute. At laſt <hi>Conſtantia</hi> broke ſilence, and ſhewing him, what
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99165:51"/>
                     <hi>Elvira</hi> had caus'd to be added; You have betray'd your ſelf, My Lord, continu'd ſhe, you have been over-heard, and your Secret is known. It was in that very Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the Princes whole Strength did Abandon him, and that his preſent Condition became worthy of Compaſſion. He could not forgive himſelf that Unvolun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Crime which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the Amiable Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <hi>Agnes</hi>; and though he was convinc'd of <hi>Conſtantia's</hi> Bounty, the Vexation which this Prudent, and Modeſt Maid might receive from his Conduct, did carry it above all other Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſs who was exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of him with her Eyes, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo many marks of deſpair on his Face, that ſhe fear'd the effects of it, and obligingly holding forth her hand to him; I promiſe you, my Lord, ſaid ſhe, that I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver complain of you, and that <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> ſhall ever be dear to me. You
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99165:51"/>
ſhall not find me inclin'd to make you reproaches; and not being capable of poſſeſſing your heart, Il'e reſt ſatisfyed in endeavouring to render my ſelf worthy of it. <hi>Don Pedre</hi> more concern'd than before, bowed a Knee before <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> kiſs'd with reſpect that hand which ſhe had given him, and, perhaps did forget <hi>Agnes</hi> for a moment.</p>
                  <p>But Love did ſoon put a ſtop to theſe ſmall Progreſſes of <hi>Hymen,</hi> That fatal Planet which did predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate over Don <hi>Pedre</hi>'s Fate, had not yet ſpent all it's malignity; and one moment of <hi>Agnes</hi> his ſight, ſoon added new Forces to his Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>That fair Maids conſent had had no ſhare in her victory, her eyes were exact and diſcerning, but they ſought not in the Princeſs eyes, for that which they would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to her.</p>
                  <p>She never did uſe to be long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> wherefore Don <hi>Pedre</hi> was no ſooner gone out of the Cloſet but ſhe came into it,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99165:52"/>
and finding the Princeſs mov'd and melting, ſhe doubted not but that ſhe had ſome juſt Cauſe of Sorrow; ſhe put her ſelf in the ſame poſture, that the Prince had been but a moment before, and expreſſing her diſturbance with concerned Looks, Madam, ſaid ſhe, in the name of your Bounties, conceal not from me the Cauſe of that Trouble I find in you. Alas! <hi>Agnes,</hi> reply'd the beautiful Princeſs, what is it you would know, and what am I to tell you? The Prince is in Love. That hand which he once gave me, was no preſent of his heart, and all the advantage of this Allyance, will but make me the Sacrifice. The Prince in Love! reply'd <hi>Agnes,</hi> with an Amazement mixt with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation: And what Fatal Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can diſpute with yours the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of an heart ſo juſtly due to you? Ah! Madam, all my reſpect cannot hinder me from murmuring againſt him. Do not accuſe him of any thing, reply'd <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99165:52"/>
ſtrives all that he can, and I am more oblig'd to his endeavouring to remain faithful to me, than if I really did enjoy his affections. It is not ſufficient to fight for to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and the Prince does more in that diſpoſition he finds himſelf in, than I ought to have hoped for. In fine, he is my Husband, an amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Husband, to which there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting, but that which I have not been able to inſpire in him, that is, a Paſſion which had rendred me too happy. Ah! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, cryed out <hi>Agnes de Caſtro,</hi> tranſported with her affection for <hi>Conſtantia</hi>: He is a blind Prince, who knows not the precious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which he poſſeſſes. It muſt needs be that he knows more, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the Princeſs, modeſtly: But Madam, continued <hi>Agnes,</hi> is there any thing either in <hi>Portugal,</hi> or in all <hi>Spain,</hi> that can be compar'd to you? And not to reckon on the Qualities of your Perſon, can thoſe of your mind be ſufficiently prais'd?
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99165:53"/>
—My Dear <hi>Agnes,</hi> replyed the Princeſs ſighing, ſhe that takes my Husbands heart from me, has but too much wherewith to plead his Excuſe, ſeeing it is of thee that Fortune has made uſe to give me that woeful blow: Yes, <hi>Agnes</hi> the Prince loves thee, and that Merit which I know to be in thee, puts a ſtop to my Complaints, not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the leaſt reſentment.</p>
                  <p>The Beauteous <hi>Agnes</hi> little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected what the Princeſs had ſaid to her. Thunder and Lightning, had leſs ſurpris'd and abaſs'd her, ſhe remain'd long Speechleſs; but at laſt fixing her looks on <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>; What ſay you Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd ſhe, and what thoughts have you had of me? What ſhould I be capable of betraying you? And in coming here fill'd with Zeal for the quiet of your Life I ſhould bring with me but a direful Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that ſhould diſturb it? How ſhould I deteſt that little of Beauty which is found in me, (though
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99165:53"/>
without any deſign in me of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it known) and that unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate day in which I firſt beheld the Prince! But Madam it cannot be me certainly that the Heavens have choſen to travers you. They are not ſo much my Enemy to put me to ſo ſevere a Tryal, and if I was that Odious Perſon, there would be no Exiles nor Torments to which I would not condemn my ſelf. 'Tis <hi>Elvira,</hi> Madam, whom the Prince has formerly Lov'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Marriage, and even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Blanch</hi>'s Divorce; ſome indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet reports have been made you concerning that intregue of his Younger days; but that which has happen'd in the time of <hi>Blanch,</hi> has no relation to you. It is moſt certain that <hi>Don Pedre</hi> Loves, you anſwered the Princeſs, and I have vanity enough to believe that of truth, there is none but you in all <hi>Spain</hi> that can diſpute it with me, but his ſecret is diſcover'd, and he has not deny'd it. What, reply'd
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99165:54"/>
the Beauteous <hi>Agnes,</hi> with a greater ſurpriſe it is from himſelf, that you have receiv'd the Intelligence of his weakneſs? Then did <hi>Constantia</hi> ſhew her the Verſes, and there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was any diſpair like hers.</p>
                  <p>While they were in that ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, Impatient <hi>Elvira,</hi> who was deſirous to learn the effects of her Practices came again to the Princeſs, where ſhe had a free acceſs, ſhe was not hindred from going to her very Cloſet, and her Preſence drew a redneſs on the cheeks of two reſtleſs and afflicted Perſons which deſired not her Company, ſhe had the ſatisfaction of obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Constantia</hi> to lay aſide thoſe Verſes, which the Princeſs had not ſeen without her Malice, and of an imoderate Sorrow in her Eyes, and in <hi>Agneſe</hi>'s alſo. She remain'd there juſt ſo long as needed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form her that ſhe had ſucceeded well, but the Princeſs who deſired not ſuch an obſtinate Witneſs of the troubles ſhe was in at that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99165:54"/>
preſent, order'd to be left alone, <hi>Elvira</hi> went out, and <hi>Agnes de Caſtro</hi> retired at the ſame time alſo.</p>
                  <p>It was in her own Chamber, that examining more at large her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, ſhe found it as cruel as Death it ſelf. She Lov'd <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> with a true Affection, and till then, had not had for the Prince of <hi>Portugal</hi> but an eſteem mixed with that admiration which could not be deny'd to his Excellent Qualities, and conſidering her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with extremity of Grief, as the cauſe of the Sorrows of ſuch a Princeſs to whoſe Bountys ſhe was ſo Indebted, ſhe Employd all the Night in Tears and Complaints, which ſufficiently reveng'd <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia</hi> of theſe Evils which ſhe caus'd her to feel.</p>
                  <p>The Prince was no leſs diſturb'd, his Wives generoſity increaſed his remorſes, without diminiſhing his love. He did fear, not without great likelineſs, that they who had
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99165:55"/>
poſſeſt <hi>Conſtantia</hi> with thoſe Verſes, would alſo acquaint the King of his paſſion, from whom he could not expect ſo great an Indulgency, and he would freely part with his Life to free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from that extremity.</p>
                  <p>The afflicted <hi>Conſtantia</hi> did Languiſh in a deplorable condition, ſhe could not ſee any thing in thoſe Perſons that caus'd her Misfortune, but what was apt to move her tender affections. At laſt Jealouſy deſign'd, (but vainly) to combat that tendency which ſhe had, to Love them. The Prince was not leſs dear unto her, and ſhe could not be ſenſible either of hatred or indifferency towards her rival.</p>
                  <p>While that theſe three uneaſy Perſons did abandon themſelves unto their Melancholy, <hi>Elvira</hi> who was reſolved not to let her ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance remain imperfect was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving by what means ſhe might accompliſh it. Her Brother on
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99165:55"/>
whom ſhe did depend, did ſhew her a great affection, and gueſſing that the Loves of <hi>Don Pedre</hi> and <hi>Agnes</hi> of <hi>Caſtro</hi> would not be approv'd of by the King, ſhe diſcover'd it to <hi>Don Alvares,</hi> who was not Ignorant of the former that the Prince had had with his Siſter. He found himſelf moſt powerfully concern'd in the news ſhe had told him, through a ſecret paſſion which he had for <hi>Agnes,</hi> which he had concealed in his own Breaſt leaſt it ſhould in any ſort thwart the ſmooth courſe of his good Fortune, and he was in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a continuation of <hi>Don Alfonſes</hi> Favours, whereby to render his Heart, a more conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able preſent.</p>
                  <p>He concealed not from his Siſter a Miſtery which he had found very difficult to keep ſecret, and it prov'd a duplication of vexation to her, to find <hi>Agnes</hi> the Sovereign of all thoſe Hearts over which ſhe had any pretentions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:99165:56"/>
                     <hi>Don Alvares</hi> was one of thoſe Ambitious men that are ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Moderation, Proud without Generoſity, of cruel inclination, and who to attain his ends, could not ſee any thing, that was either difficult or Illigitimate. He Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaly lov'd not the Prince who in all reaſon was to poſſeſs the firſt place in <hi>Don Alfonſe</hi>'s Heart, and who ſet limits unto <hi>Don Alvare</hi>'s good Fortune. But he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that he was his Rival, Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie increas'd his hatred, and he intreated <hi>Elvira</hi> to employ all her cares to croſs an engagement which could not but be oppoſite to his deſigns. She promiſed him all aid and aſſiſtance, though ſhe was not ſatisfied, as to her own concerns, and he rely'd on her promiſe and dexterity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Alvares,</hi> who had ſenſibly felt the Prince of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in his amours, had no other thoughts but of thwarting and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his Merits. He had no

                  <p>He knew well that <hi>Don Pedre</hi>'s Love could not but inſpire <hi>Don Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſe</hi> with a violent anger; and being over diligent in doing evil, his firſt Care was to inform him of it.

State in which the Kings Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had placed him; few Women could well refuſe his Allegiance, <hi>Don Alfonſe</hi> did aſſure him the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of his Friendſhip and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and did aſſure him that he himſelf ſhould looſe his authority, or that he would make him Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Agnes.</hi>

                     <hi>Don Alvares,</hi> perfectly learned in the Art of managing his Maſter did anſwer his laſt bounties with a profound ſubmiſſion, and very fit to continue them. He had never ſpoken to <hi>Agnes</hi> what he did feel for her, but he then thought it time to break forth, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſought after the means to perform it.</p>
                  <p>The galantry of <hi>Coimbria</hi> which lay in oblivion did then rouſe it ſelf up again. The King to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <hi>Don Alvares</hi> under a pretence of diverting of <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome public ſports, and it was his Pleaſure that all things ſhould appear very magnificently.</p>

And ſeing that he could not appear ſo Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly with <hi>Agnes's</hi> Colours, he took thoſe of the Princeſs, without any Motto or Agreements.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Alvares</hi> ſet himſelf off with <hi>Agnes de Caſtro's</hi> Liveries, and that beautiful Maid, who found no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in what the Princeſs had ſaid, had this further addition of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Pedre</hi> did appear in the Liſt extream graceful, and <hi>Don Alvares</hi> who look'd upon this day as his own, did appear all Glittering with Gold and Jewels mixed with blew, which was <hi>Agnes</hi>'s Colour, and his Equipage was all over ſprinkled with inflamed Hearts, and Love Knots, with aboundance

                     <hi>Don Alvares</hi>'s Pride was laid humble at <hi>Don Pedre</hi>'s Feet, who bore him down with twenty more, and he alone carried the honour of the day. At Night there was a gallant appearance at <hi>Conſtantia</hi>'s appartment, where <hi>Agnes</hi> had not been without an expreſs and abſolute order from the Princeſs. She did appear very negligently dreſt, though ſtill charming with Vexation, ſhe had ſeen her Name and Colours us'd by <hi>Don Alvares,</hi> in a public Solemnity, and if her Heart was capable of any tenderneſs it was not for ſuch a Perſon as he, that her Nicety de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd them.

                  <p>The Princeſs eaſily obſerv'd it, and their common misfortune having not alter'd her Friendſhip.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99165:61"/>
that ſhe remain'd Speechleſs; for ſome Moments, ſome ſincere Tears expreſs'd her firſt grief, and after ſhe had ſufficiently ſhed them to give <hi>Agnes</hi> a ſufficient Mark of her Tenderneſs, ſhe fixed her Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Eyes upon her, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligingly holding forth her hand to her, then you will go, my dear <hi>Agnes,</hi> continu'd ſhe, and further expoſe me unto the ſorrow of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you no more.

Sacrific'd my ſelf for my Princeſs, I ſhould bear it without any Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur; But in fine though I ſhould be <hi>Don Alvare's</hi> Wife, <hi>Don Pedre</hi> would ſtill have the ſame Eyes, and I find nothing better then to go hide my ſelf in ſome Corner of the World, where I ſhall certainly Live without Comfort; but where I ſhould preſerve my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. All that Juſtice which you can find in this deſign, anſwer'd the Princeſs, ſhall not oblige me to approve of it. Would your Abſence reſtore me <hi>Don Pedre's</hi> Heart, and would he not fly with you? His Cares, are mine, my Life is link'd with his, reduce him not then to a diſpair, if you, love me. I know you, I once again declare it to you, and what power ſoever you have over the Prince<hi>'s</hi> heart, I ſhall not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that you ſhould leave us.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Agnes</hi> believ'd ſhe had a perfect Knowledg of <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> ſhe did not expect ſuch a fund of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99165:63"/>
Virtue, ſhe found her ſelf the more Unfortunate by it, and the Prince more Guilty. Oh! Wiſdom, Oh! Bounty! beyond Example cry'd ſhe out; why do not the Cruel Fates afford you all that you deſerve. You are the Arbiter of all my Actions, continu'd ſhe, kiſſing one of <hi>Constantia's</hi> hands, I will not do but what you pleaſe; but I beſeech you to think on what reaſon ought to prompt you to preſcribe to me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Pedre,</hi> who had not yet ſeen the Princeſs that day, came in juſt then, and finding them both diſturb'd he inquired after the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with ſome earneſtneſs. My Lord reply'd <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> the too Wiſe and too ſcrupulous <hi>Agnes</hi> fears the Effects of her Beauty, and will no longer live at <hi>Coimbria</hi> and it is on that Account, which cannot be pleaſing to me, that ſhe is asking my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. At this diſcourſe the Prince grew pale, and with more diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance then either of them had.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99165:63"/>
                     <hi>Agnes</hi> cannot err, ſaid he, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing your Counſels; Madam, and I leave you with free Liberty of given them to her. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently went out, and the Princeſs whoſe heart he did ſo abſolutely poſſeſs, not being able to conceal her diſcontent. My dear <hi>Agnes,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd ſhe, though my ſatisfaction was not chain'd to the ſight of you, I ſhould ſtill deſire it on <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre's</hi> account. It is, the only Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that his Unfortunate Love can hope for, and ſhould I not be with Juſtice reputed barbarous, if I ſhould contribute towards his being depriv'd of it? But that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is but a Poiſon to him, reply'd <hi>Agnes,</hi> and what ſhould I do my Dear Princeſs, if after ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, his Mouth ſhould add to thoſe Evils which I have already felt, that of hearing him ſpake of his flame? You ſhould hear him without running him into diſpair, added <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> and I ſhould charge that new Obligation on my

Account. You would have me to wait for events that I fear, Madam, anſwer'd <hi>Agnes,</hi> I ſhall obey you. But ye juſt Heavens! If they are Fatal, puniſh not for them an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Heart. Thus ended that Converſation. <hi>Agnes</hi> retir'd into her Chamber; but it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hopes of being more at eaſe.</p>
                  <p>That which <hi>Don Pedre</hi> had learn'd of her deſign, produc'd a ſtrange Diſturbance in his mind, he wiſh'd he did not Love her, and deſired Death with great earneſtneſs, but it was too late for him to wiſh againſt what the Fates had decreed, and whatever he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to reſolve himſelf to bear as to the Abſence of <hi>Agnes,</hi> his Love never had the Power to conſent to it.</p>
                  <p>After he had long ſtrove, he firmly reſolv'd to do that which he would not have <hi>Agnes</hi> to do. His Courage did reproach to him that idle Life which he lead during his happieſt years,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99165:64"/>
and repreſenting to the King that their Allies, and even the Prince <hi>Don John Manuel</hi> his Father-in-Law, had buſineſs in hand which required his preſence upon the Frontiers, he eaſily obtain'd the Liberty of making that Voyage, unto which the Princeſs could make no oppoſition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agnes</hi> did ſee him depart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſorrow: but that did not proceed from any Averſion. Then did <hi>Don Alvares</hi> convert his firſt importunity into an open Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He omitted nothing to touch <hi>Agne's</hi> Heart, and for ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time employ'd none but the. Arms of Love, but finding that his reſpect and ſubmiſſion were fruitleſs, he took another Courſe, and fram'd moſt ſtrange Deſigns.</p>
                  <p>The King deferring all things to his Advices, he did eaſily inſpire in him what he pleas'd; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of <hi>Agne's</hi> Ingratitude, and fail'd not to let him know that it was but through her too great
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99165:65"/>
ſenſibility for the Prince that ſhe was ſo inſenſible to him, ſo that <hi>Don Alfonſe</hi> apt to be irritated, reiterated all thoſe Promiſes, which he had already made him.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> had not yet diſcours'd <hi>Agnes</hi> in Favour of <hi>Don Alvares,</hi> and not doubting but that his Will would overcome all ſorts of Obſtacles, he ſought after an opportunity of Entertaining her, and putting her at ſome diſtance from thoſe that might over-hear them, I did think <hi>Don Alvares</hi> to be of a ſufficient Merit, he ſaid, to obtain ſome ſmall ſhare in your Eſteem, and I did not think it neceſſary that I ſhould require it of you for him, I know you are all charming, but he has nothing unworthy of you, and on the leaſt Reflection you might make of the Choice that my Friendſhip has made of him, amongſt all the reſt of my Courtiers, you would doubtleſs readily do him more Juſtice. His Fortune is not to be

diſputed, ſince I am the Protector of it. He is of a Noble Birth, his Courage does him Honour, he adores you, and in my opinion ſo many reaſons ought to over-come your Scorns.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agnes's</hi> Heart was ſo little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to give it ſelf to <hi>Don Alvares,</hi> that all the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agerations prevail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Though <hi>Don Alvares</hi> were without Merits, Sir, She reply'd, he poſſeſſes ſufficiently of Advantages in thoſe Bounties with which your Majeſty does Honour him, to ſupply all other defects. It is not to find any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in him that I anſwer not his wiſhes; But, Sir, through what Obligation would he have me to Love him, if the Heavens have not furniſhed me with a tender Soul? and why does he pretend that I ſhould ſubmit my ſelf to him, when that nothing ought to be more dear to me then Liberty? You are neither ſo free nor ſo inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

as you ſpeak, reply'd <hi>Don Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſe,</hi> bluſhing with Anger, and if your Heart was free from all ſorts of Affections it might receive a more reaſonable one then that which poſſeſſes it. But Imprudent Maid, that you are guided by an ill fate, added he with Fury, what can you pretend from <hi>Don Pedre?</hi> Hither to I have conceal'd the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that his and your weakneſs have caus'd me; but it has not been the leſs violent for that; and ſince you oblige me to let it break forth, I ought to tell you that though my Son were not tyed to <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> his Marriage ſhould never conſern you.

conſidering the wrong which ſhe ſuſtained not as proceeding from a great King, but from a Man blinded and wholly poſſeſs'd by <hi>Don Alvares.</hi> She thought him not worthy of her reſentment. Her fair Eyes were animated with a ſparkling brightneſs, which wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed the purity of her intentions, and fixing them on <hi>Don Alfonſe</hi>; if the Prince <hi>Don Pedre</hi> has failings ſaid ſhe, with an Air that inclin'd ſomething to diſdain, he has never inform'd me of them, and I do not believe that I have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to them. To cure your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt, and ſet my Honour ſafe, I ſhall live at a diſtance from him, and all that belongs to you. Yes, Sir, I ſhall contentedly leave the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boad of <hi>Coimbria,</hi> and as to that Man ſo dear to you, added ſhe, with a Noble boldneſs, of which the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> was very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that Favorite, who is ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to poſſeſs the moſt tender af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of a great Prince, I do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

                  <p>He believ'd more then ever that ſhe did Favour <hi>Don Pedres</hi> paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and paſs'd into <hi>Conſtantias</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, to inſpire her with the ſame thought; but ſhe was not capable of receiving ſuch impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and following her Natural inclination, ſhe generouſly defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Agnes's</hi> Virtue, <hi>Don Alfonſe,</hi> vexed to find her ſo well diſpos'd on her rivals account, whom he would have her to hate, did mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur againſt her goodneſs, and went to joyn his anger to <hi>Don Alvare</hi>'s rage who no longer wa<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

braves me, Sir, ſaid he, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns the Honour that your boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have made her, that I might renounce ſo fatal a paſſion; but I muſt love her againſt my will, and though that Flame ſhould coſt me my Life, I plainly feel that I can not put it out. What i'st that I can do for you? replyed <hi>Don Alfonſe</hi>? Alas! <hi>Sir,</hi> reply'd, <hi>Don Alvares,</hi> that which I can never hope for from Proud <hi>Agne's</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Well, added the King ſeeing that I muſt not Publicly authoriſe any Violence in the Center of my Kingdom, chuſe from amongſt all my Subjects ſuch as thou ſhalt Judge moſt capable of ſerving thee; carry off that Beauty which charms thee, and if ſhe yeilds not to thy Love, make uſe of all that force can do for thee, to force her to Marry thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Alvares</hi> raviſh'd with ſuch a propoſition, which at once did Flatter his reſentments and his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99165:68"/>
love caſt himſelf at <hi>Don Alfonſe</hi>'s Feet, did expreſs his acknowleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to him, ſet forward his Zeal, with new proteſtations, and thought no longer but to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his unjuſt authority againſt <hi>Agnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Pedre</hi> had been abſent above three Months, when <hi>Don Alvares</hi> did undertake that which the King had advis'd him to do. Though the Princeſs moderation was well known to him, he fear'd his preſence, and was loath to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the return of a rival with whom nothing had yet been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.</p>
                  <p>One night that the ſorrowful <hi>Agnes,</hi> full of her daily Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances, was in vain expecting ſleep, ſome unknown men, whoſe ſteps were well order'd did take her out of the Palace, and after carried her out of <hi>Coimbria,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being hindred by any Obſtacle, ſhe could not well tell on whom to fix her Suſpicions. <hi>Don Alvares</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:99165:68"/>
ſeem'd too powerful to ſeek for his Satisfaction after ſuch a manner, and ſhe did not taxe with this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a Prince of whom ſhe had too good an Opinion. All that ſhe could ſay, did not hinder her ill adventure; ſhe was carried away with dilligence, and before day, ſhe was already conſiderably diſtant from the City.</p>
                  <p>At the firſt Glimps of day, ſhe look'd on all thoſe that ſurrounded her, not knowing ſo much as one; and perceiving well, that both out-cries, and tears, were in vain to ſuch cruel minds, ſhe reſted contented in imploring the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Heaven, and ſo aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd her ſelf to her Condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors.</p>
                  <p>While ſhe was overwhelm'd with Sorrow, and uncertain of her doom, ſhe perceiv'd a Body of Horſe to advance towards the Troops that conducted her; The raviſhers did not avoid it, beleiving it to be <hi>Don Alvares</hi>; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99165:69"/>
near, they perceiv'd that it was the Prince of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any knowledg of this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſerving <hi>Agnes,</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to <hi>Coimbria</hi> full of her <hi>Idea,</hi> after he had perform'd all that he was to do in his expedition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agnes,</hi> who did not expect him alter'd her mind, and thought that it was by his orders that ſhe was forc'd away. Ah! my Lord, ſaid ſhe, in that thought, was it you that was thus to tare me from the Princeſs? and muſt ſo cruel a blow fall on me from a hand ſo dear to her? What will you do with a miſerable wretch who ſeeks but for Death? and why will you Tarniſh the Glory of your life, by a deſign ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of you?</p>
                  <p>That Language did no leſs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe the Prince, then the ſight of <hi>Agnes</hi> had done. He Apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſhe had been forc'd away, and inſtantly reſenting the moſt peircing ſtrokes of Anger, he gave
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99165:69"/>
her to underſtand with one ſingle look, that he was not the baſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of her grief. I, tare you from <hi>Conſtantia</hi> who are all her joy, ſaid he, what thoughts have you of <hi>Don Pedre</hi>? If you ſee me here, I am wholly Innocent of that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which is offer'd you, and which I ſhall prevent. Then did he turn himſelf towards the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhers; but his preſence had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſpers'd them. He order'd his Men to purſue them, and at leaſt to ſeiſe ſome from whom he might learn the authority by which they did Act.</p>
                  <p>During this, <hi>Agnes</hi> was not leſs confus'd then before, ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd the conduct of her Fortune, who brought the Prince at the very moment that he was ſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to her. Her equity did ſoon redreſs the wrong which her diſtruſts had caus'd her to do him. She felt ſome joy to have eſcaped a Misfortune which appear'd ſo certain to her, but it was no quiet
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99165:70"/>
joy, when ſhe conſider'd that her deliverer was her lover too, and ſuch a lover as deſerv'd her entire acknowledgments, but that alſo owed his Heart to the moſt ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Princeſs in the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Alvares,</hi> who fear'd being ſeen near to <hi>Coimbria,</hi> and who delay'd Proſecuting of <hi>Agnes</hi> till ſhe was at a diſtance from it, had confided his deſign to ſome Friends, which he jug'd capable to execute it, and that had done it had not the Prince interpos'd.</p>
                  <p>During the time that his Men were perſuing of the Raviſhers of <hi>Agnes,</hi> he remain'd almoſt alone with her, and though he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd always to avoid her preſence, his Fortitude could not withſtand ſo fair an occaſion. Madam ſaid he, is it poſſible that Men born amongſt thoſe that obey us, ſhould be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of offending you? It was not to the care of Puniſhing ſuch a Crime that I thought my ſelf reſerv'd; but ſince the Heavens have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99165:70"/>
that you ſhould receive it, I muſt periſh or cauſe you to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it. My Lord, reply'd <hi>Agnes,</hi> more mov'd at this diſcourſe, then at <hi>Don Alvares</hi>'s enterpriſe, thoſe that want reſpect for the Princeſs and for you, may be diſpens'd from having any for me. I no longer doubt but that <hi>Don Alvares</hi> is the Author of this attempt, and I judge what I may expect from him, by that which his importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has made me ſuffer. He is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Kings protection, and he deſigns to make him partner in his crimes; But my Lord the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens have conducted you moſt happily here for me, and to you do I owe the Liberty of again ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Princeſs. You would do for <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> that which is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible not to perform for you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd <hi>Don Pedre,</hi> your goodneſs binds you to her, and others For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes does for ever engage them to you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:99165:71"/>The modeſt <hi>Agnes,</hi> who dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this diſcourſe, as much as the danger which had been prevented, made no other anſwer then to caſt down her looks, and the Prince who underſtood her diſorder, left her to ſpake to two of his Men, who brought him back one of thoſe that <hi>Don Alvares</hi> had employ'd. He pardon'd him, and did not think that he ſhould puniſh him, for having obey'd a man, who was made Almighty through his Fathers weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>After this, <hi>Agnes</hi> was brought back to <hi>Coimbria</hi> where her being forc'd away, began to be highly cenſur'd. The Princeſs, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Afflicted, and at firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd it was a conſequence of that deſign which that Fair Maid had expreſs'd to her of her retirement; but ſome Women that waited on her, having declar'd that violence had been offer'd to her, <hi>Conſtantia</hi> went and made her complaints to the King, who gave no great atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the relation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:99165:71"/>Madam, ſaid he, let that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Plague that deprives you of your Husbands Heart, be remov'd from you, and be not Afflicted at her abſence, rather thank Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with me for it.</p>
                  <p>The generous Princeſs took <hi>Agne</hi>'s part, with a great deal of courage, and ſhe was ſtill diſputing with the King, when <hi>Don Pedre,</hi> came to <hi>Coimbria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt object which ſtruck his Eyes was <hi>Don Alvares,</hi> who was croſſing one of the Courts of the Palace, in the midſt of a Cloud of Courtiers, which his Favour did faſten to him. The ſight of him caus'd <hi>Don Pedre</hi> to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd, but the ſight of <hi>Don Pedre</hi> and <hi>Agnes</hi> gave him much greater troubles, he eaſily gueſt that it was <hi>Don Pedre</hi> who had reſcued her from his Men, and if his fury could have Acted all that it would have done, it had produc'd very ſad Effects, at that very Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:99165:72"/>
                     <hi>Don Alvares,</hi> ſaid the Prince to him, is it thus that you employ that authority which the King my Father gives you? have you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Employs, and Power from his bounty, but to employ them in perfidiouſneſs and in abuſing of Women? Were you ignorant of that intereſt which the Princeſs has in this Maid, and did you not know what a tender affectionate eſteem ſhe has for her? No, reply'd <hi>Don Alvares,</hi> with ſuch inſolency as did quite anger the Prince, I was not Ignorant of it, nor of that ſhare your Heart has in it. Baſe wretch, reply'd the Prince, neither that favour which thou abuſes, nor that inſolence which makes thee p<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:99165:72"/>
                     <hi>Don Pedre</hi> went forwards at theſe words, and left <hi>Don Alvares</hi> in ſuch a rage as cannot be expreſs'd mad to ſee an enterpriſe fail, which he believ'd ſo ſure, and at the Princeſs ſcorn of him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd to himſelf to Sacrifice all to his revenge.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Don Alfonſe</hi> lov'd his Son, he was too much prepoſſes'd with his paſſion, to Pardon him what he had newly done, and he did condemn an action of great Juſtice, as if it had been an heinous Crime.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elvira</hi> who the ſweetneſs of hope had flatter'd for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, beheld <hi>Agne's</hi> return with a moſt ſenſible Sorrow, which left her no other thoughts then of ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up her Brother to revenge.</p>
                  <p>In fine the Prince did ſee <hi>Don Alfonſe,</hi> but inſtead of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by him with that joy which he owed to the good ſucceſs of his expedition, he ſhewed him nothing but a cloſe Anger. After he had
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99165:73"/>
render'd, him his firſt reſpects, and and exact account of his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings he ſpoke to him of that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which had been offer'd <hi>Agnes de Castro,</hi> and complain'd of it in the Princeſs<hi>'s</hi> Name as well as his own. You ought to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in that reſpect, reply'd the King, and that motive which cauſes you to ſpake, is ſo ſhameful that I bluſh and ſigh for you. What concerns it you whether that maid, whoſe preſence troubles me, be remov'd from hence or not? ſo long as I would have it ſo. But Sir, reply'd Don <hi>Pedre,</hi> was open force, craft and the night Seaſon, to be employ'd, where the leaſt of your orders was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient? <hi>Agnes</hi> had obey'd you, and if ſhe remains here ſtill, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure it is againſt her will. However, Sir, <hi>Conſtantia</hi> is offended at it, and without the fear of diſpleaſing you, which, retains me, that action had not remain'd unpuniſh'd. How happy are you,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99165:73"/>
reply'd <hi>Don Alfonſe,</hi> with a ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſmile, to make uſe of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia's</hi> name in this, to maintain the intereſts of your Heart. Do you think I know them not, and that that unfortunate Princeſs, looks on the wrong you do her with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency? never more mention <hi>Agnes</hi> to me continu'd he, in a ſevere Tone, be ſatisfy'd that I Pardon you for what is paſs'd, and think well on the kindneſs which I have for <hi>Don Alvares,</hi> when ere you deſign any thing againſt him. No, Sir, anſwered the anger'd Prince, I ſhall not ſpake any more of <hi>Agnes</hi>; but neither <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> nor I will any longer ſuffer her to be any more expos'd unto the inſolency of your Favorite.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Portugal</hi> had like to have broke forth at this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; but ſome Reliques of Prudence prevented it. Retire, ſaid he to <hi>Don Pedre,</hi> and go make Reflections on what I can do, and what you owe me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:99165:74"/>During this Converſation, <hi>Agnes</hi> was receiving from the Princeſs, and from all the Ladies of the Court, great Expreſſions of Joy and Friendſhip, <hi>Conſtantia</hi> ſaw again her Husband, with a great deal of ſatisfaction and far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſorry at what he had lately done for <hi>Agnes,</hi> ſhe privately return'd him thanks for it, and ſtill was the ſame towards him, nothwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Jealouſy which was endeavour'd to be inſpired in her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Alvares</hi> who found in his Siſter, a Maliciouſneſs worthy of his truſt, did not conceal his fury from her. After ſhe had made vain attempts to moderate it, in blotting <hi>Agnes</hi> out of his Heart, ſeeing that his Diſeaſe was incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſhe made him underſtand, that ſo long as <hi>Conſtantia</hi> ſhould not be Jealous, there was no hopes. That if <hi>Agnes</hi> ſhould once be ſuſpected by her, ſhe would not fail of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning her, and that then it
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99165:74"/>
would be eaſie to get Satisfaction, the Prince being now ſo Proud of <hi>Conſtantia's</hi> indulgency. In giving this Advice to her Brother, ſhe promis'd to ſerve him effectually, and having no need of any body but her ſelf, to perform ill things, ſhe recommended <hi>Don Alvares</hi> to manage well the King.</p>
                  <p>Four Years were paſs'd in that Melancholy ſtation, and the Princeſs beſides her firſt dead Child, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> who was ſtill Living, had brought two Daughters into the World.</p>
                  <p>Some Days after <hi>Don Pedre's</hi> return, <hi>Elvira,</hi> who was moſt Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous in the Art of well Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Wicked Deſign, did gain one of the Servants which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to <hi>Conſtantia's</hi> Chamber; ſhe firſt ſpoke her fair, than over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd her with Preſents and Gifts, and finding in her as ill a Diſpoſition as in her ſelf, ſhe readily reſolv'd to employ her.</p>
                  <p>After ſhe was ſure of her, ſhe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99165:75"/>
compos'd a Letter, which was after Writ over again in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Hand, which ſhe depoſited in that Maids Hands, that ſhe might deliver it to <hi>Constantia</hi> with the firſt opportunity, telling her that <hi>Agnes</hi> had dropt it; This was the Subſtance of it.</p>
                  <p>I employ not my own Hand to Write to you, for Reaſons that I ſhall acquaint you with. How happy am I to have overcome all your Scruples! And what Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall I find in the Progreſs of our Intreague! The whole Courſe of my Life, ſhall continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to you the ſincerity of my Affections; pray think on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Converſation that I require of you. I fancy ſtill, that all Perſons that approach you, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of ſomething of my due. I dare not ſpake to you in public; Therefore come this Night where you know, I conjure you to it by all that I have ſuffered; Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no more <hi>Conſtantia</hi> to me; ſhe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99165:75"/>
muſt be ſatisfy'd with my Eſteem, ſince that my Heart could be none but Yours.</p>
                  <p>The falſe <hi>Portuguiſe</hi> Servant, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd <hi>Elvira</hi> exactly, the very next day perceiving <hi>Agnes</hi> coming from the Princeſs ſhe brought the Letter to <hi>Constantia,</hi> who receiv'd it, and found in it, that which ſhe was far from thinking on. Never did tenderneſs produce ſo ſorrowful an Effect as then. Alas! they are both Guilty, ſaid ſhe ſighing, and notwithſtanding that Tendency which I find in my Heart to juſtifie them, my reaſon muſt needs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them. Unfortunate Princeſs, Sorrowful Subject of Fortunes Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricios, why canſt thou not Dye, ſeeing thou art not of a Humor to Revenge thy ſelf! <hi>Don Pedre,</hi> ought you to give me your Hand, when you knew you could not give me your Heart? And thou fair and ungreateful <hi>Agnes,</hi> wer't thou born to produce the Evil of my Days, and to be the cauſe of my
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99165:76"/>
Death? After ſhe had given ſome Moments unto the violence of her Sorrow, ſhe call'd to her that Perſon who had brought her the Letter, charg'd her not to ſpake of it to any body, and then order'd that no body whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhould be Admitted into her Chamber.</p>
                  <p>Then did ſhe with more Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty think on him whom ſhe could not inſpire with Love, and on her that betray'd her. The trouble of her Soul did not hinder her from ſeeking ſome means to excuſe them. And deſirous to do all that ſhe could for <hi>Don Pedre,</hi> ſhe took a firm Reſolution of not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elvira</hi> was not long, without being Inform'd of what paſs'd, and of the Princeſs<hi>'s</hi> Sorrow, whence ſhe hoped for all that ſhe could wiſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agnes</hi> far from imagining any ſuch Storm, return'd to <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> and learning her indiſpoſition, ſhe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:99165:76"/>
paſs'd the reſt of the day at her Chamber door, to learn ſome News of her; but ſhe was not permitted to enter. That No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty did ſurpriſe and diſturb'd her. The Prince had the ſame fate, and was ſtartled at an order that was not to concern him.</p>
                  <p>Finally the next day <hi>Conſtantia</hi> appear'd; but with ſo much De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that it was difficult to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that ſhe had ſuffer'd much. <hi>Agnes</hi> was the moſt preſſing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach her. The Princeſs could not contain her Tears. They both kept ſilence along time, <hi>Conſtantia</hi> did attribute that of <hi>Agnes,</hi> to ſome remorſe, and that Unfortunate Maid not being able to contain any longer; is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Madam, ſaid ſhe, that two days can have depriv'd me of all that Bounty which you had for me? What have I done? And for what Crime are you thus to puniſh me? The Princeſs look'd lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhingly
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99165:77"/>
upon her, and did not anſwer her, but with a ſigh, and <hi>Agnes</hi> offended at ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedneſs, went out after an haſty manner, which contributed much to make her be thought Guilty.</p>
                  <p>After this the Prince came, who found <hi>Conſtantia</hi> more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd then uſually, and he moſt obligingly did Conjure her, not to neglect her Indiſpoſition. My greateſt good, is not the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Life, My Lord, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd ſhe, I ſhould take more care of it, did I love you leſs; But — ſhe could not go on, and the Prince being put into a Conſternation through her diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, did moſt ſorrowfully ſigh'd without anſwering, which caus'd her an increaſe of Sorrow. To this ſome grains of anger being added, and all things tending to perſwade the Princeſs that ſhe was Sacrificed amongſt them, ſhe did not enter on any diſcourſe that might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99165:77"/>
a right underſtanding, ſo left her Husband retire without ſpeaking to him.</p>
                  <p>Nothing is more capable of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing our Reaſon, and of alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Health, then the ſecret Motions of Jealouſy and Solitude. <hi>Conſtantia</hi> who was accuſtom'd, to ſpake freely to <hi>Agnes,</hi> and who beleiv'd ſhe was deceiv'd by her, did Abandon her ſelf to ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity as quite did overcome her. She fell violently Sick. The whole Court was concern'd at this Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune; and <hi>Don Pedre</hi> was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Afflicted at it: But <hi>Agnes</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd more Concern'd then all the Reſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conſtantia's</hi> Coldneſs towards her, her continual ſighs, and her obſtinate Diſtemper, caus'd that after ſhe had ſought after the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it, in all that ſhe could recal into her Memory, ſhe began to fear her ſelf, and to reproach her ſelf for all that the Princeſs did ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:99165:78"/>Mean time the Diſtemper did ſo increaſe that <hi>Conſtantia's</hi> Life was extreamly fear'd, and that ſhe her ſelf began to find that it was time to think no longer of it; that though caus'd her no diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, She look'd on Death as a great good, and perceiv'd the deſpair thoſe Perſons approach'd her were in without the leaſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Alfonſe</hi> who lov'd her and knew her Virtue, was mov'd at the Extremity ſhe was in, and <hi>Don Alvare's</hi> who had not loſt the leaſt occaſion, of making him conceive that it was Jealouſy which caus'd <hi>Conſtantia's</hi> Death, did but too much Exaſperate him againſt ſuch Criminals as were moſt worthy of Compaſſion.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Portugal</hi> was not of a Temper long to Conceal his Anger. You give Examples, ſaid he to the Prince, that will render your Memory very Illuſtrious, and <hi>Conſtantia's</hi> Death, of which none
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99165:78"/>
but you can be accus'd, is the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Effects of a Guilty Paſſion. Dread Heaven after this, and look on your ſelf as a Monſter that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not to Live. If my Blood did not ſtill Plead in your behalf, what might you not fear from my juſt Reſentments? But what may not the Imprudent <hi>Agnes,</hi> to whom nothing Binds me, expect, if <hi>Conſtantia</hi> Periſhes? She that in my Court Foments your fooliſh Paſſion with vain hopes, and cauſes us to looſe ſo Amiable a Princeſs, that you were not worthy to poſſeſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Pedre</hi> knew, that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia</hi> was not Ignorant of his concerns for <hi>Agnes</hi>; but he alſo knew with what Moderation ſhe had always expreſs'd her ſelf on that point. The Kings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach was very ſenſible; but his fault not being voluntary, and that an Imperious Accident did force him to Love in deſpight of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99165:79"/>
all his reſiſtance, he appear'd more Afflicted, then Confounded. Without well examining of me, you have accus'd me, Sir, anſwer'd he, and if my intentions were well known to you, you would not, may be, find me ſo guilty, I ſhould take the Princeſs whom you ſay I Sacrifice for Judge of my Actions, were ſhe in a Condition to be Conſulted. If I am Guilty of any Weakneſs, her Equity has never reproach'd me of it, and my Mouth has never informed <hi>Agnes</hi> of it. But Sir, though I had Committed ſome Fault wherefore would you Puniſh an Innocent Maid for it? Who would perhaps Condemn them as much as you do? Ah! Wretch reply'd the King, ſhe has but too much favour'd you, and thy flames had not been ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant had they not been well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. Sir, reply'd the Prince, peirc'd with Sorrow for the wrong which was offer'd to <hi>Agnes,</hi> you
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99165:79"/>
offend a Virtue moſt pure, and thoſe expreſſions which proceed from your Anger, do not become you. <hi>Agnes</hi> has afforded me no Favours, I did never ask her any, and I proteſt that I have not had ſo much as a thought againſt what I owe to <hi>Conſtantia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While they were in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe one of the Princeſſes Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men came all in Tears to Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe <hi>Don Pedre,</hi> that ſhe was at the laſt Gaſpe. Go look on your Work, ſaid the King, and expect no longer, from a Father, who has but too much ſpar'd you, but that Severity which you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
                  <p>The Prince did run to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> who he found Dying, and <hi>Agnes</hi> in a Swound in the Arms of ſome Women. That which had caus'd that redoubling of illneſs, was that <hi>Agnes,</hi> who could no longer bear the Princes indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, had Conjur'd her to tell
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99165:80"/>
her what her Crime was, and either to deprive her of life or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore her Friendſhip to her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conſtantia</hi> who felt that ſhe muſt ſuddainly Dye, would not retain a ſecred Anger againſt <hi>Agnes,</hi> and after ſome words that prepar'd her to a ſorrowful clearing of the buſineſs ſhe ſhew'd her that Perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Note, which <hi>Elvira</hi> had Compos'd. Ah! Madam, cry'd out the Beautiful <hi>Agnes,</hi> after ſhe had Read it, Ah! Madam, how many ſorrowful diſquiets had you ſpared me, if your Heart had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd it ſelf with its accuſtomed Bounty. It is not hard to ſee that this Letter is Artificial, and that I have moſt Mercileſs Enemies. Can you believe the Prince ſo Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as to employ another Hand, then his own in ſuch an occaſion as this? And do you think me ſo ſimple as to keep that teſtimony of my ſhame with ſo little Cautiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? you are not betray'd, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99165:80"/>
by your Husband, nor by me I call Heaven to Witneſs, and thoſe Attempts which I made to get out of <hi>Coimbria.</hi> Alas! My Dear Princeſs, how little have you known ſhe that you have ſo Honour'd. Believe not that if I have juſtify'd my ſelf, I ſhall ever ſuffer the Worlds Converſation. No, no, there is no retreat diſtant enough for me to flye to, and I ſhall ſo well conceal my face, that it ſhall never give offence.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſs mov'd at <hi>Agnes</hi> diſcourſe and Tears, did preſs her hand, which ſhe held, and fixing her looks on her, capable to move compaſſion in the moſt inſenſible Souls; If I have done you any wrong, my dear <hi>Agnes,</hi> anſwer'd ſhe, Death which I expect every moment will avenge you of it. I ought alſo to proteſt to you, that I have not ceaſed loving you, and that I believe all that you ſay, in giving you again my moſt tender affection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:99165:81"/>It was then that that ſorrow, which acted on them both did reduce them to that extremity, which caus'd the Prince to be call'd in. He was incapable of doing any thing at the fight of them, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding thoſe tender motions that inclin'd him towards <hi>Agnes,</hi> he run directly to <hi>Conſtantia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Princeſs, unto whom a cold clammy ſweat did denounce her laſt moment, felt that ſhe had no time to looſe and cauſing all Perſons to withdraw that ſhe ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, my Lord, ſaid ſhe to <hi>Don Pedre.</hi> Though I quit my life without repining, I leave not you without regret and trouble. But dear Prince I muſt overcome even dying, and I will wholly forget my ſelf, to turn my thoughts only on you. I reproach you not, well knowing that it is inclination alone that diſpoſes of Hearts, and not reaſon. <hi>Agnes</hi> is ſufficiently Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, to inſpire moſt ardent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99165:81"/>
and ſufficiently virtuous to deſerve the beſt Fortune in the World. I alſo ask her Pardon for ſome ſmall wrong which I have done her, and recommend her to you, as a Perſon moſt dear to me. Promiſe me, before I expire, to give her my Place in your domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It cannot be better fill'd. You cannot make choice of a more perfect Princeſs for your People, nor a better Mother for your Children. And you my dear and faithful <hi>Agnes,</hi> continu'd ſhe, lend not an ear to a too ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous virtue, which might oppoſe it ſelf to the Prince of <hi>Portugals</hi> happineſs. Refuſe him not, an Heart that he is worthy of, and give him that Friendſhip which you had for me, with that which you owe to his Merit. Take care of young <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> and of the two little Princeſſes that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve me in you, ſpake of me ſometimes to them. Farewell
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99165:82"/>
live both happy, and receive my laſt embraces.</p>
                  <p>The afflicted <hi>Agnes,</hi> who had recover'd a little of ſtrength, loſt once more all her ſenſes. Her faintneſs was follow'd with ſuch violent Convulſions that her life was in very great danger. But <hi>Don Pedre</hi> kept cloſe to <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> what, Madam, would you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; and with a belief that it were an advantage to me. Ah! <hi>Conſtantia</hi> if my Heart has in any wiſe wrong'd you, your own vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue puniſhes it, againſt your will for it. Think you me ſo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous —as he was going to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue he perceiv'd that Death was cloſing for ever the generous Princeſs<hi>'s</hi> Eyes, and it little wanted that he did not follow her.</p>
                  <p>But what an abyſs of Sorrow was this to <hi>Agnes</hi>? ſo ſoon as ſhe learn'd, during a reſpite, that her reaſon receiv'd that <hi>Conſtantia</hi> was newly expir'd, ſhe would have
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99165:82"/>
deſtroy'd her ſelf, and gave a full ſcope to her diſpair.</p>
                  <p>At the Noiſe of this Death both the City and Fields were in an uproar, <hi>Elvira</hi> who then ſaw <hi>Don Pedre</hi> free to diſpoſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, repented for having contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Death of the Princeſs. <hi>Don Pedre</hi> who accus'd himſelf of it, did condole his Misfortune; And <hi>Agnes</hi> who thought herſelf the true cauſe of it, did promiſe to her grief that ſhe would never forgive herſelf for it.</p>
                  <p>There was reaſon to watch her for diverſe days, in which ſhe dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not her Tears The Prince im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd them in a deep Mourning; But when the firſt Notions of grief were over, thoſe of his love made him ſenſible that he was ſtill the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Alvares,</hi> who fear'd now the Prince's diſengagement, made new attempts to gain <hi>Agnes de Caſtro,</hi> who was become inſenſible of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99165:83"/>
all things but of her own diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. <hi>Elvira</hi> deſirous to reap advantage from her own dexterity, imploy'd all the Art, and Craft in her brains, to rekindle thoſe fires wherewith the Prince had formerly courted her; but his inconſtancy was already limited, and <hi>Agnes</hi> alone was to reign over his Heart.</p>
                  <p>She had taken a firm reſolution ſince the Death of <hi>Conſtantia</hi> to give her ſelf wholly up to retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the reſt of her Life. Maugre all the Cautiouſneſs which ſhe us'd to conceal her deſign, the Prince was inform'd of it, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd all he could to diſpoſe his conſtancy to ſubmit to it. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiv'd himſelf ſtronger then he was in that point; but after he had well Conſulted himſelf, he knew but too well, how much <hi>Agnes's</hi> preſence was neceſſary to his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. Madam, ſaid he to her one day, his Heart ready to break,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99165:83"/>
and his Eyes full of Tears, which of the Actions of my Life, may have caus'd you to reſolve on my Death! Though I have never told you how much I Love you, I am Perſwaded that you are not Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it. I have been forc'd to ſilence during many years, for yours, <hi>Conſtantia's,</hi> and my own ſake; But it is no longer in my power ſo to conſtrain my ſelf, and I ought to expreſs my ſelf at leaſt once with you. Receive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the aſſurance of a paſſion, full of reſpect and of heat with the offer of my Fortune, which I ſhould not wiſh better, but to ſhare it with you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agnes</hi> anſwer'd not at firſt to theſe words but with abundance of Tears; at laſt having dryed them up, and looking on <hi>Don Pedre</hi> with an Air, which gave him to underſtand that ſhe was not well agreed with her wiſhes; If I were capable of that Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99165:84"/>
which you would inſpire me with, My Lord, reply'd ſhe, you were oblig'd to Puniſh me for it. What, <hi>Conſtantia</hi> is ſcarce in her Tomb, and you would have me to offend her thus? No my Dear Princeſs, added ſhe, with more vehemency, No, ſhe who you have ſo much weighed down with favours, ſhall not deſerve the curſe of Heavens and the ſcorn of Men by ſo perfidious an action. Do not therefore, my Lord, <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bſtinate your ſelf in a deſign which I ſhall never approve of. You owe <hi>Constantia</hi> ever after her Death, ſuch a fidelity as may juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you; and I, to repair thoſe Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which I have caus'd her, I ought to avoid all Converſation with you. Go Madam, reply'd the Prince, changing Colour, go and expect the News of my Death, in thoſe places where your Cruelty ſhall Conduct you. They ſhall follow you cloſe, and that War,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99165:84"/>
that now employs our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours will ſoon procure it me.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe words made the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Agnes</hi> of <hi>Caſtro</hi> to feel that her innocence was not altogether ſuch as ſhe had taken it to be, and that her Heart did concern it ſelf for the Prince. You owe the Preſervation of your Life unto the Prince and Princeſs, that <hi>Conſtantia</hi> has left you, ſhe tenderly reply'd. Would you abandon their Youth to <hi>Don Alvares</hi>? Live, my Lord, live, and Permit the moſt unhappy <hi>Agnes</hi> to fall a ſingle Sacrifice? Ah! thou Cruel Maid, reply'd the Prince, why do you order me to Live, if I cannot live without you? Is it an effect of your ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred? No, My Lord, reply'd <hi>Agnes,</hi> with ſome concern, I hate you not; and would to Heaven that a little of indifferency would come and aſſiſt my Weakneſs, cauſe me not to ſay more. You perceive my Bluſhes, expound them as you
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99165:85"/>
pleaſe; but ſtill conſider, that the leſs Averſion I find in me towards you, the more guilty I render my ſelf, and that I ought not to ſee or ſpake to you. In fine, My Lord, if you oppoſe my retirement, I declare that <hi>Don Alvares,</hi> as odious to me as he is, ſhall ſerve me as a fence againſt you, and that I ſhall rather reſolve to marry a Man which I abhore, than to favor a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which has caus'd <hi>Conſtantia's</hi> Life. Well, <hi>Agnes,</hi> reply'd the Prince with looks full of ſorrow, follow thoſe Motions that your Barbarous Virtue inſpires you with. Take thoſe cautious Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which you judg moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, againſt an Unfortunate Love, and enjoy the Glory of having refus'd all to my deſires.</p>
                  <p>He retired at theſe words, and all troubled, as was <hi>Agnes,</hi> ſhe would not retain him; Her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage overcame her Grief and ſhe thought more then ever on her depart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:99165:85"/>It had been difficult for her to leave <hi>Coimbria,</hi> without the Kings conſent, and not to defer that which appear'd ſo neceſſary to her, ſhe was at <hi>Don Alfonſes</hi> Apartment. Maugre <hi>Don Alvares</hi> intereſts, he ſhew'd her a ſevere brow, and yet not being able to give his conſent to her requeſt, you ſhall not ſtir from hence, ſaid he, and if you are wiſe, you will here ſhare and enjoy any Friendſhip with <hi>Don Alvares.</hi> I have deſign'd another way, Sir, anſwer'd <hi>Agnes,</hi> and the World has no ſhare in it. You might except <hi>Don Pedre,</hi> reply'd the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> his condition may ſatisfy an ambitious Perſon; but you would not ſucceed <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> who ſo tenderly lov'd you; and <hi>Spain</hi> hath more Princeſſes wherewith to fill, a part of that Throne, which I am to leave to my Son, Sir, reply'd <hi>Agnes,</hi> touch'd to the quick with that diſcourſe. If I had any diſpoſitions for Love,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99165:86"/>
and deſigns of mariage, the Prince ſhould be perhaps the only Perſon, on whom I could fix them, and you, Sir, know that if my anceſtors wore no crowns yet they were not unworthy of them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I will be gone, and I believe not my ſelf a Slave in a place in which I came free.</p>
                  <p>This bold Anſwer, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd truly <hi>Agne's</hi> Character, did ſtartle <hi>Don Alfonſe,</hi> and at the ſame time did vex him alſo. You ſhall go, when we ſhall think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, reply'd he, and without being a Slave at <hi>Coimbria</hi> you ſhall however expect our orders there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agnes</hi> well ſaw that there was no ſhrinking from thence and ſhe was ſo troubled at it, that ſhe kept her Chamber for many days, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out daring to inquire after the Prince; and that ſolitude ſav'd her the labour of ſeeing <hi>Don Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vares.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>During this <hi>Don Pedre</hi> fell ſick,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99165:86"/>
with ſo much violence and danger, that the fear of his Death was general. <hi>Agnes</hi> could not doubt but that it was an effect of his troubles ſhe at firſt believ'd her ſelf ſufficiently ſtrong to ſee him dye, rather then prove favourable; but ſome ſmall reflections did ſoon convince her of the contrary. She found not in the bottom of her Heart that cruel conſtancy, which ſhe thought to be ſo firmly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd there. She felt ſome trouble and diſorder, ſhed Tears, made wiſhes, and finally diſcovered all her Weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>None could behold the Heir to the Crown, and a Prince that ſo well deſerv'd it in that extremity, without a general affliction. The People who lov'd him, did paſs whole days at the Palace Gates, to learn news of his health, and the Courtiers were ſorrowful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Alvares</hi> alone could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal a Malicious Joy before the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99165:87"/>
King, under ſorrowful appearances. <hi>Elvira</hi> full of tenderneſs, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of remorſe ſuffer'd on her part alſo. The King who though he condemn'd his Sons love, did however love him, could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to looſe him, and <hi>Agnes de Caſtro,</hi> who knew the exceſs of his grief expected the end with ſtrange agitations.</p>
                  <p>Finally after more then a Month of fears, ſome little hopes did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. The Prince himſelf, with Don <hi>Alvares,</hi> were the only two, that had no joy at it, but <hi>Agnes</hi> did feel enough for all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Don <hi>Pedre</hi> perceiving that he muſt reſolve to live, againſt his own will, thought no longer then how to paſs ſorrowful days, ſo ſoon as he was able to go, he ſought after ſolitarineſs, and even gain'd ſo much over his weakneſs, as to go in all Places where <hi>Agnes</hi> did not appear but her Idea follow'd
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99165:87"/>
him ſtill every where, and his memory very faithful in repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting her to him with ſo many Charms, did ſtill render her dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
                  <p>One day, that he had been conducted in the Garden, he ſought after a Labyrinth which was at the fartheſt end, there to conceal his Melancholy during ſome hours, he found the ſorrowful <hi>Agnes,</hi> who had been brought thither by thoughts little differing from his, and her ſight which he expected not, caus'd him to ſtagger, ſhe perceiv'd in his Paleneſs, and weakneſs, ſome relicks of his diſeaſe. His Eyes full of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhments, diſturb'd her; and notwithſtanding the deſire ſhe had to fly, an unknown Power retain'd her, and it was impoſſible for her to retreat.</p>
                  <p>After ſome moments of ſilence which was interrupted with many ſighs, <hi>Don Pedre</hi> did riſe from a

place where his weakneſs had caus'd him to reſt, he ſhew'd to <hi>Agnes</hi> coming towards her, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful marks of his ſufferings, and not contented to conſerne her pitty by her Eyes; you had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd my Death, cruel <hi>Agnes,</hi> ſaid he, to her, my will was agreed to it; but the Heavens would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve me for greater evils, and I again behold you, as unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, but more in amour'd then I was before;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agnes</hi> wanted not thoſe words to molify her, the Prince's languid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did ſpake, and that fair Maids Heart was but too well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to render up it ſelf. She then believ'd that <hi>Conſtantia</hi> ought to reſt ſatisfied. Love who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated for <hi>Don Pedre,</hi> did triumph over Friendſhip, and found out that happy moment, after which the Prince of <hi>Portugal</hi> had ſo long ſighed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:99165:88"/>Reproach me not of that which has coſt me more then you, my Lord, ſaid ſhe, and accuſe not an Heart that is neither ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful nor barbarous. I muſt ſay that I love you; but when that is confeſs'd what do you require more?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Pedre</hi> who expected not ſo favourable a revolution, did feel a double ſatisfaction, and falling at <hi>Agnes's</hi> Feet; he told her more, with a ſilence which his Paſſion had caus'd then all the moſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent words could have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd.</p>
                  <p>After he had been ſenſible of all his happineſs, he conferr'd with <hi>Agnes</hi> on what they had to fear from <hi>Don Alfonſe.</hi> They concluded that the unfortunate Paper which had diſturb'd <hi>Conſtantia's</hi> laſt days, could not proceed but from <hi>Elvira,</hi> and <hi>Don Alvares.</hi> The Prince who knew that the King was ſeeking already after new
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99165:89"/>
alliances for him, and that would have his Favorite to Marry <hi>Agnes,</hi> did ſo tenderly conjure her, to prevent her perſecutions, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to a ſecret Marriage; that ſhe agreed to it after a long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, I ſhall do all that you pleaſe my Lord, ſaid ſhe, though I have but very ſorrowful foreſights. All my Blood freezes when I think on that Marriage, and <hi>Constantia's</hi> Image ſeems as if it would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it.</p>
                  <p>The amorous Prince did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thoſe ſcruples, and parted from <hi>Agnes</hi> with a ſatisfaction, which ſoon recover'd all his ſtrength. He after that did ſee her, with the Pleaſure of miſtery in love, and at laſt the day of their union was come. <hi>Don Gill,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Guarda,</hi> performed the ceremonies of their Marriage, in preſence of divers witneſſes that were Faithful to <hi>Don Pedre</hi> who became poſſeſs'd of all <hi>Agnes's</hi> Charms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:99165:89"/>She liv'd not quiet for being now the Prince of <hi>Portugals</hi> wife. Her Enemies who ſtill Proſecuted her did not leave her without diſturbance; and the King who was offended at her reſiſtance, did abſolutely command her to Marry <hi>Don Alvares,</hi> with threats to force her will if ſhe continu'd refractory.</p>
                  <p>The Prince did highly take her part, and that joyn'd to the refuſal which he made of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a Princeſs of <hi>Arragon,</hi> gave ſuſpicions of the truth to the King his Father.</p>
                  <p>He had a ſecond, but too much intereſted in the buſineſs, not to unravel it. <hi>Don Alvares,</hi> and his Siſter did act in it with ſuch cares, gave ſuch largneſs, and made ſo many promiſes, that at laſt they did diſcover the ſecret engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt <hi>Agnes</hi> and <hi>Don Pedre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:99165:90"/>There little wanted but that the King at firſt ſo highly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported, had not broke forth in a cruel manner againſt the fair Princeſs. <hi>Don Alvares,</hi> whoſe love did change into a violent hatred, did ſtop his firſt fury in making him conceive that though the Marriage could be made void he ſhould not be ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd, and he ſo well did Poiſon <hi>Alfonſes</hi> mind, that he made him conſent to <hi>Agnes's</hi> Death.</p>
                  <p>The Barbarous <hi>Don Alvares</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd his arm for that horrid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, and his rage did ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently anſwer for the certainty of the ſacrifice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Alfonſe,</hi> who thought the honour of his Family to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd by this alliance, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly his in his Son's proceedings, did give a full power unto that executioner who animated him.</p>
                  <p>It was not very eaſy to execute that deſign though the Prince did
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99165:90"/>
not ſee <hi>Agnes</hi> but in ſecret, all his cares were ſtill watching for her good, and he had been above a Year her husband, when <hi>Don Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vares</hi> found the occaſion which he had ſo long ſought after.</p>
                  <p>The Prince did not take much Pleaſure, nor but rarely did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance himſelf from <hi>Coimbria.</hi> One unfortunate day, and ſet a part by the Heavens, for ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid an act, he made a match at Hunting, towards a ſtately Houſe that the Kings of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> have near to the City.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Agnes</hi> lov'd all that could pleaſe him, but a ſecret trouble did make her to fear that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate journey. My Lord ſaid ſhe to him, being alarm'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing for what, I tremble ſeing you to day, as if it was the laſt time in my life. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your ſelf my dear Prince,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:99165:91"/>
and though the exerciſe you are going about is not always dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, conſider the leaſt of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and bring me back all that I confide in you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Pedre</hi> who had never ſeen her ſo Fair and ſo Charming, did divers times embrace her, and went out of the Palace with his retinue not to return thither again till the next day.</p>
                  <p>While he was going, the cruel <hi>Don Alvares</hi> was preparing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for that Bloody execution which he had reſolv'd. He thought it of that importance as not to ingage himſelf ſingly, and made choice, to accompany him in it of <hi>Don Diego Lopes Pacheo,</hi> and <hi>Pedro Cuello,</hi> two ſuch monſters as himſelf, whoſe cruelties had been aſſur'd him by his preſents.</p>
                  <p>They ſtay'd till night, and the

Bautiful <hi>Agnes</hi> was in her firſt ſlumber, which was the laſt of her life, when thoſe murtherers came to her bed ſide. Nothing had oppos'd <hi>Don Alvares,</hi> who was all powerful, and who was introduced near <hi>Agnes,</hi> by the blackeſt of furies. She did awake and perceiv'd, drawing the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, by the light of a Taper, left lighted, the dagger with which <hi>Don Alvare's</hi> hand was arm'd. He having not covered his face ſhe eaſily knew him, and forgetting her own danger to think of the Princes. Juſt Heavens! ſaid ſhe lifting up her Eyes, if you will avenge <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> reſt contented with all my Blood, and ſpare <hi>Don Pedre</hi>'s. The barbarous Villain who heard her, gave her not time to ſay more, and having not had the Fortune to move <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes's</hi> Heart, he receiv'd the horrid ſatisfaction of ſtabbling it through with a Dagger, His partners did
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:99165:92"/>
give her ſome blows alſo, and there needed not ſo many to put an end to her innocent life.</p>
                  <p>What a Spectacle, for thoſe that approach'd her Bed the next Morning, and what news for the moſt unfortunate Prince of <hi>Portugal.</hi> He preſently return'd to <hi>Coimbria</hi> at the firſt rumour of this adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and did behold that which had certainly coſt him his life, if one could dye of grief. After he had a thouſand times embrac'd the bloody Corpſe of <hi>Agnes,</hi> and ſaid all that a juſt deſpair could prompt him to ſpeak, he run up and down the Palace like a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted Man, requiring the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of his wife from things that underſtood him not. He at laſt ſaw the King, and without obſerving any reſpect, he gave a full ſcope to all his reſentments, after he had long ſpoken, he fell oppreſs'd with grief into a faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which laſted all the reſt of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99165:92"/>
the day. He was carried into his appartment, and <hi>Don Alfonſe</hi> believing that this evil would prove his cure, did not repent him of what he had done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Don Alvares</hi> with the two others went out of <hi>Coimbria,</hi> and that abſence diſcover'd their guilt, of which the moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Prince did promiſe a ſuddain revenge unto fair <hi>Agnes</hi>'s Aſhes, being reſolv'd to perſue them to the very end of the World. He made a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble party of thoſe that were affectionate to him, and after he had made havok of thoſe Territories which are water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Duero,</hi> he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd that War unto the Death of <hi>Alfonſe,</hi> inceeſſantly mixing of Tears with the blood which he ſpilt in revenge of his dear <hi>Agnes's</hi> Murther.</p>
