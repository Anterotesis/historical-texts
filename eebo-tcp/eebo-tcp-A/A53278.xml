            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>THE Author might here (according to the laudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble custom of Prefaces) entertain the Reader with a Discourse of the Original, Progress, and Rules of</hi> Satyr, <hi>and let him understand, that he has lately Read</hi> Casaubon, <hi>and several other Criticks upon the Point; but at present he is minded to wave it, as a vanity he is in no wise fond of. His only intent now is to give a brief account of what he Publishes, in order to prevent what Censures he foresees may coulourably be past thereupon: And that is, as followeth:</hi>

                     <hi>What he calls the</hi> Prologue, <hi>is in imitation of</hi> Persius, <hi>who has prefix'd somewhat by that Name before his Book of Satyrs, and may serve for a pretty good Authority. The first Satyr he drew by</hi> Sylla's Ghost <hi>in the great</hi> Johnson, <hi>which may be perceived by some strokes and touches therein, however short they come of the Original. In the second, he only followed the swinge of his own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>. The Design, and some Passages of the</hi> Franciscan <hi>of</hi> Buchanan. <hi>Which ingenious confession he thinks fit to make, to shew he has more modesty than the common Padders in Wit of these times. He doubts, there may be some few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes in Chronology therein, which for want of Books he could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:52622:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                     <hi>As for the next Poem (which is the most liable to censure) tho the world has given it the Name of the</hi> Satyr <hi>against</hi> Vertue, <hi>he declares 'twas never design'd to that intent, how apt soever some may be to wrest it. And this appears by what is said after it, and is discernable enough to all, that have the sense to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it, 'Twas meant to abuse those, who valued themselves upon their Wit and Parts, in praising Vice, and to shew, that others of sober Principles, if they would take the same liberty in Poetry, could strain as high rants in Profaneness as they. At first he intended it not for the publick, nor to pass beyond the privacy of two or three Friends, but seeing it had the Fate to steal abroad in Manuscript, and afterwards in Print, without his knowledg, he now thinks it a Justice due to his own Reputation, to have it come forth without those faults, which it has suffered from Transcribers and the Press hitherto, and which make it a worse Satyr upon himself, than upon what it was design'd.</hi>

                     <hi>Something should be said too of the last Trifle, if it were worth it. 'Twas occasioned upon reading the late Translations of</hi> Ovid<hi>'s</hi> Epistles, <hi>which gave him a mind to try what he could do upon a like Subject. Those being already forestall'd, he thought fit to make choice of the same Poet, whereon perhaps he has taken too much liberty. Had he seen Mr.</hi> Sandys <hi>his Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before he began, he never durst have ventured: Since he has, and finds reason enough to despair of his undertaking. But now 'tis done, he is loth to burn it, and chuses rather to give somebody else the trouble. The Reader may do as he pleases, either like it, or put it to the use of Mr.</hi> Jordan<hi>'s Works. 'Tis the first attempt, he ever made in this kind, and likely enough to be the last, his vein (if he may be thought to have any) lying another way.</hi>

                     <hi>BEing to appear anew in the World, it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that I should say something concerning these ensuing Trisies, which I shall endeavour to do with as much briefness, as I did besore what I last pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished in this kind.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I doubt not but the Reader will think me guilty of an high presumption in adventuring upon a Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of</hi> The Art of Poetry, <hi>after two such great Hands as have gone before me in the same attempts: I need not acquaint him, that I mean</hi> Ben Johnson, <hi>and the Earl of</hi> Roscommon, <hi>the one being of so establish'd an Authority, that whatever he did is held as Sacred, the other having lately performed it with such admirable success, as almost cuts off all hope in any after Pretenders of ever coming up to what he has eone. Howbeit, when I let him kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>w, that it was a Task imposed upon me, and not what I voluntarily engaged in; I hope he will be the more favourable in his Censures. I would indeed very willingly have wav'd the undertaking upon the forementioned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and urged it as a reason for my declining the same, but it would not be allowed as sufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse me therefrom. Wherefore, being prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make an Essay. I fell to thinking of some course, whereby I might serve my self of the Advantages, which those that went before me, have either not
<pb facs="tcp:52622:81"/>
minded, or scrupulously abridged themselves of. This I soon imagined was to be effected by putting</hi> Horace <hi>into a more modern dress, than hitherto he has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in, that is by making him speak, as if he were living, and writing now. I therefore resolved to alter the Scene from</hi> Rome <hi>to</hi> London, <hi>and to make use of</hi> English <hi>names of Men, Places, and Customs, where the Parallel would decently permit, which I conceived would give a kind of new Air to the Poem, and render it more agreeable to the rellish of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Age.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>With these Considerations I set upon the Work, and pursued it accordingly. I have not, I acknowledg, been ever-nice in keeping to the words of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, for that were to transgress a Rule therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Nevertheless I have been religiously strict to its sense, and express'd it in as plain, and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible a manner, as the Subject would bear. Where I may be thought to have varied from it (which is not above once or twi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>e, and in Passages not much material) the skilful Reader will perceive 'twas necessary for carrying on my proposed design, and the Author himself, were he again alive, would (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) forgive me. I have been careful to avoid stiffness, and made it my endeavour to hit (as near as I could) the easie and familiar way of writing, which is peculiar to</hi> Horace <hi>in his Epistles, and was his proper Talent above any of mankind. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, 'tis humbly submitted to the judgment of the truly knowing, how I have acquitted my self herein. Let the success be what it will, I shall not however wholly repent of my undertaking, being (I
<pb facs="tcp:52622:81"/>
reckon) in some measure recompenced for my pains by the advantage I have reaped of fixing these admirable Rules of Sense so well in my memory.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Satyr <hi>and</hi> Odes <hi>of the Author, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low next in order, I have translated after the same libertine way. In them also I labour'd under the disadvantages of coming after other persons. The</hi> Satyr <hi>had been made into a Scene by</hi> Ben Johnson, <hi>in a Play of his, called the</hi> Poetaster. <hi>After I had finished my imitation thereof, I came to learn, that it had been done likewise by Dr.</hi> Sprat, <hi>and since I have had the sight of it amongst the Printed Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations of</hi> Horace<hi>'s Works. The</hi> Odes <hi>are there done too, but not so excellently well, as, to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage any farther endeavours. If these of mine meet with good entertainment in the world, I may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps find leisure to attempt some other of them, which at present suffer as much from their Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as the Psalms of</hi> David <hi>from</hi> Sternhold <hi>and</hi> Hopkins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The two sacred</hi> Odes <hi>I designed not to have made publick now, forasmuch as they might seem unfit to appear among Subjects of this nature, and were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to come forth apart hereafter in company of others of their own kind. But, having suffer'd Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of them to straggle abroad in Manuscript, and remembring the Fate of some other Pieces of mine, which have formerly stoln into the Press without my leave, or knowledg, and be exposed to the world abominably false and uncorrect; to prevent the same misfortune likely en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:52622:82"/>
amongst the rest. Nor is the Printing of such Miscella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies altogether so unpresidented, but that it may be seen in the Editions of Dr.</hi> Donne, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Cowley<hi>'s Works, whether done by their own appointment, or the sole direction of the Stationers, I am not able to determine.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>As for the two Essays out of</hi> Greek, <hi>they were occasioned by a report, that some persons found fault with the roughness of my Satyrs formerly published, tho, upon what ground they should do it, I could be glad to be informed. Unless I am mistaken, there are not many Lines but will endure the reading with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out shocking any Hearer, that is not too nice, and censorious. I confess, I did not so much mind the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as the Sense and expressiveness of my words, and therefore chose not those, which were best disposed to placing themselves in Rhyme, but rather the most keen, and tuant, as being the most sutable to my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And certainly no one that pretends to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the several Colours of Poetry, would expect that</hi> Juvenal, <hi>when he is lashing of Vice and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, should flow so smoothly, as</hi> Ovid, <hi>or</hi> Tibullus, <hi>when they are describing Amours and Gallantries, and have nothing to disturb and ruffle the evenness of their Stile.</hi>

                     <hi>That, which laments the Death of</hi> Adonis <hi>has been attempted in</hi> Latine <hi>by several great Masters, namely,</hi> Vulcanius, Douza, <hi>and</hi> Monsieur le Fevre. <hi>The last of them has done it Paraphrastically, but left good part of the Poem toward the latter end untouch'd, perhaps because he thought it not so capable of Ornament, as the rest. Him I chiefly chose to follow, as being most agreeable to my way of translating, and where I was at a loss for want of his guidance, I was content to steer by my own Fancy.</hi>

                     <hi>The Translation of that upon</hi> Bion <hi>was begun by another Hand, as far as the first fifteen Verses, but who was the Author I could never yet learn. I have been told that they were done by the Earl of</hi> Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; <hi>but I could not well believe it, both because he seldom medled with such Subjects, and more especially by reason of an uncorrect line, or two to be found amongst them, at their first coming to my hands, which never us'd to flow from his excellent Pen. Conceiving it to be in the Original, a piece of as much Art, Grace, and Tenderness, as perhaps was ever offered to the Ashes of a Poet, I thought fit to dedicate it to the memory of that incomparable Person, of whom nothing can be said, or thought so choice and curious, which his Deserts do not surmount. If it be thought mean to have borrowed the sense of another to praise him

in, yet at least it argues at the same time a value and reverence, that I durst not think any thing of my own good enough for his Commendation.</hi>

                  <p>THE Author of the following Pieces must be excused for their being hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out so confusedly. They are Printed just as he finished them off, and some things there are which he designed not ever to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, but was fain to do it, to keep the Press at work, when it was once set a going. If it be their Fate to perish, and go the way of all mortal Rhimes, 'tis no great matter in what method they have been placed, no more than whether <hi>Ode, Elegy,</hi> or <hi>Satyr</hi> have the honour of Wiping first. But if they, and what he has formerly made Publick, be so happy as to live, and come forth in an Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all together; perhaps he may then think them worth the sorting in better Order. By that time belike he means to have ready a very Sparkish Dedication, if he can but get himself known to some Great Man, that
<pb facs="tcp:52622:153"/>
will give a good parcel of Guinnies for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing handsomly flatter'd. Then likewise the Reader (for his farther comfort) may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to see him appear with all the Pomp and Trappings of an Author; his Head in the Front very finely cut, together with the Year of his Age, Commendatory Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in abundance, and all the Hands of the Poets of the <hi>Quorum</hi> to confirm his Book, and pass it for Authentick. This at present is content to come abroad naked, Undedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and unprefaced, without one kind Word to shelter it from Censure; and so let the Criticks take it amongst them.</p>

                        <l>So oft for its damn'd sake must wish to die:</l>

                        <l>Dear faithless Thing, I find, could prove untrue?</l>

                        <l>For thee, false Jilt, to bear eternal Pain?</l>
                        <l>'Tis not thy Letters, which thy Crimes reveal,</l>

                        <l>But that (alas!) too much of proof does bear:</l>

Bless'd he, who what he loves can justifie,</l>

                        <l>Your Glances were not mute, but each bewray'd,</l>
                        <l>And with your Fingers Dialogues were made:</l>
                        <l>I understood the Language out of hand,</l>

This, and much more I said, by Rage inspir'd,</l>
                        <l>While conscious shame her Cheeks with Blushes fir'd:</l>
                        <l>Such lovely stains the face of Heav'n adorn,</l>
                        <l>When Light's first blushes paint the bashful Morn:</l>
                        <l>So on the Bush the flaming Rose does glow,</l>
                        <l>When mingled with the Lillies neighb'ring Snow:</l>
                        <l>This, or some other Colour much like these,</l>
                        <l>The semblance then of here Complexion was:</l>
                        <l>And while her Looks that sweet Disorder wore</l>
                        <l>Chance added Beauties undisclos'd before:</l>
                        <l>Upon the ground she cast her jetty Eyes,</l>
                        <l>Her Eyes shot fiercer Darts in that Disgulse:</l>
                        <l>Her Face a sad and mournful Air express'd,</l>
                        <l>Her Face more lovely seem'd in sadness dress'd:</l>
                        <l>Urg'd by Revenge, I hardly could forbear,</l>
                        <l>Her braided Locks, and tender Cheeks to tear:</l>
                        <l>Yet I no sooner had her Face survey'd,</l>
                        <l>But strait the tempest of my Rage was laid:</l>

A look of her did my Resentments charm,</l>
                        <l>A look of her did all their Force disarm:</l>
                        <l>And I, that fierce outrageous thing e're-while,</l>

                        <l>The worst of which, should <hi>Jove</hi> himself but taste,</l>
                        <l>The brandish'd Thunder from his Hand would wrest:</l>
                        <l>Well-pleas'd I was, and yet tormented too,</l>
                        <l>For fear my envied Rival felt them so:</l>
                        <l>Better they seem'd by far than I ere taught,</l>
                        <l>And she in them shew'd something new methought:</l>
                        <l>Fond jealous I my self the Pleasure grutch,</l>
                        <l>And they displeas'd, because they pleas'd too much:</l>
                        <l>When in my mouth I felt her darting Tongue,</l>
                        <l>My wounded Thoughts it with suspicion stung:</l>

                        <l>More reason for complaint remains behind:</l>
                        <l>I grieve not only that she Kisses gave,</l>

                     <hi>THe Author of these following Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems being dead, the Publisher thought fit to acquaint the World, that the reason why he exposed them now in Print, was not so much for his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest (tho a Bookseller that disclaims Interest for a pretence, will no more be believed now adays, than a thorough pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Phanatick, that pretends he makes a journey to</hi> New England <hi>purely for conscience sake) but for securing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Mr.</hi> Oldham; <hi>which might otherwise have suffered from worse hands, and out of a desire he has to print the last Remains of his friend since he had the good fortune to publish his first Pieces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:52622:264"/>
                     <hi>He confesses that it is the greatest piece of injustice to publish the posthumous Works of Authors, especially such, that we may suppose they had brought to the file and sent out with more advantages into the World, had they not been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by untimely death; and therefore assures you he had never presumed to print these following Miscellanies, had they not already been countenanced by men of unquestionable repute and esteem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He is not of the same perswasion with several others of his own profession, that never care how much they lessen the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the Poet, if they can but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance the value of the Book; that ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sackt he Studies of the deceased, and print all that passed under the Author's hands, from Fifteen to Forty, and upwards: and (as the incomparable Mr.</hi> Cowley <hi>has
<pb facs="tcp:52622:264"/>
exprest it) think a rude heap of ill placed Stones a better Monument than a neat Tomb of Marble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the Description of the Country P—(the only part in this Book that he judges liable to exception) he makes you no Apology at all; For to men of candor and judgment any thing that comes from Mr.</hi> Oldham <hi>will certainly be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; to others that are resolved to damn at first sight he thinks a defence of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture signifies no more than a Plantiffs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions to a hungry Judg after twelve. However he is very confident that the rest of Mr.</hi> Oldham's <hi>pieces will abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly atone for one unfinished draught, and that no man of sense and reason will qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel at one bad half Crown, in a good, round, substantial lump of Money.</hi>

                     <l>Cast in the same Poetick mould with mine.</l>
                     <l>One common Note on either Lyre did strike,</l>

                     <l>Through the harsh cadence of a rugged line.</l>
                     <l>A noble Error, and but seldom made,</l>
                     <l>When Poets are by too much force betray'd,</l>
                     <l>Thy generous fruits, though gather'd ere their prime</l>
                     <l>Still shew'd a quickness; and maturing time</l>
                     <l>But mellows what we write to the dull sweets of Rime.</l>
                     <l>Once more, hail and farewel; farewel thou young,</l>
                     <l>But ah too short, <hi>Marcellus</hi> of our Tongue;</l>

Possest with Spleen, which Melancholy bred,</l>

                     <l>That <hi>Oldham</hi> honour'd for his early Worth,</l>
                     <l>Was cropt, like a sweet Blossom from the Earth,</l>
                     <l>Where late he grew, delighting every Eye</l>
                     <l>In his rare Garden of Philosophy.</l>
                     <l>The fatal Sound new Sorrows did infuse,</l>
                     <l>And all my Griefs were doubled at the News:</l>
                     <l>For we with mutual Arms of Friendship strove,</l>
                     <l>Friendship the true and solid part of Love;</l>
                     <l>And he so many Graces had in store,</l>
                     <l>That Fame or Beauty could not bind me more.</l>
                     <l>His Wit in his immortal Verse appears,</l>
                     <l>Many his Vertues were, tho' few his Years;</l>
                     <l>Which were so spent as if by Heaven contriv'd,</l>
                     <l>To lash the Vices of the longer liv'd.</l>
                     <l>None was more skilful, none more learn'd than he,</l>
                     <l>A Poet in its sacred Quality:</l>
                     <l>Inspir'd above, and could command each Passion,</l>
                     <l>Had all the Wit without the Affectation.</l>
                     <l>A Calm of Nature still possest his Soul,</l>
                     <l>No canker'd Envy did his Breast controul:</l>
                     <l>Modest as Virgins that have never known</l>
                     <l>The jilting Breeding of the nauseous Town;</l>
                     <l>And easie as his Numbers that sublime</l>
                     <l>His lofty Strains, and beautifie his Rhime,</l>
                     <l>Till the Time's Ignomy inspir'd his Pen,</l>
                     <l>And rowz'd the drowsie Satyr from his Den;</l>
                     <l>Then fluttering Fops were his Aversion still,</l>
                     <l>And felt the Power of his Satyrick Quill.</l>

                     <l>But Pride to know he understood it well.</l>

                     <l>But Fate grew envious of thy growing Fame,</l>
                     <l>And knowing Heav'n from whence thy <hi>Genius</hi> came,</l>
                     <l>Assign'd thee by immutable Decree</l>
                     <l>A glorious Crown of Immortality,</l>

                     <l>Yet by his Reader still was kept in view.</l>
                     <l>His Fancy, like <hi>Jove</hi>'s Eagle liv'd above,</l>
                     <l>And bearing Thunder still would upward move.</l>
                     <l>Oh Noble <hi>Kingston!</hi> had thy lovely Guest</l>

                     <l>Not all thy Greatness, and thy Vertues store</l>
                     <l>Had surer Comforts been, or pleased thee more.</l>
                     <l>But Oh! the date is short of mighty Worth,</l>
                     <l>And Angels never tarry long on Earth.</l>
                     <l>His soul, the bright, the pure Etherial Flame</l>
                     <l>To those lov'd Regions flew, from whence it came.</l>
                     <l>And spight of what Mankind had long believ'd,</l>
                     <l>My Creed says only Poets can be sav'd.</l>
                     <l>That God has only for a number staid,</l>
                     <l>To stop the breach, which Rebel Angels made</l>
                     <l>For none their absence can so well supply;</l>
                     <l>They are all o're Seraphick Harmony.</l>
                     <l>Then, and not that till then the World shall burn</l>
                     <l>And its base Dross, Mankind their fortune mourn,</l>
                     <l>While all to their old nothing quick return.</l>

Long time had you here brightly shone below</l>

                     <l>Too great for ought, but Deities appear:</l>
                     <l>But Heaven (it may be) was not yet compleat,</l>

                  <head>A <hi>Sunday-Thought</hi> in Sickness.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>LOrd, how dreadful is the Prospect of Death at the remotest Distance! How the smallest Apprehension of it can pall the most gay, airy and brisk Spirits! Even I, who thought I could have been merry in sight of my Coffin, and drink a Health with the</hi> Sexton <hi>in my own Grave, now tremble at the least Envoy of the King of Terrors. To see but the shaking of my Glass makes me turn pale, and fear is like to prevent and do the Work of my Distemper. All the Jollity of my Humor and Conversation is turn'd on a suddain into shagrin and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, black as Despair, and dark as the Grave. My Soul and Body seem at
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52622:291"/>
once laid out, and I fancy all the Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets of Eternal Night already hanging upon my Temples. But whence proceed these Fears? Certainly they are not idle Dreams, nor the accidental Product of my Disease, which disorders the Brains, and fills 'em with odd</hi> Chimaera's. <hi>Why should my Soul be averse to its Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Why should it be content to be knit up in two Yards of Skin, when it may have all the World for its Purliew? 'Tis not that I'm unwilling to leave my Relations and present Friends: I'm part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the first already, and could be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd from both the length of the whole Map, and live with my Body as far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from them as my Soul must when I'm dead. Neither is it that I'm loth to leave the Delights and Pleasures of the World; some of them I have tried, and found
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52622:292"/>
empty, the others covet not, because un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. I'm confident I could despise 'em all by a Greatness of</hi> Soul, <hi>did not the Bible oblige me, and Divines tell me, 'tis my Duty. It is not neither that I'm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to go hence before I've establish'd a Reputation, and something to make me survive my self. I could have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be Still-born, and have no more than the</hi> Register, <hi>or</hi> Sexton <hi>to tell that I've ever been in the Land of the Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> In Fine, <hi>'tis not from a Principle of Cowardise, which the Schools have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> Self-preservation, <hi>the poor Effect of Instinct and dull pretence of a Brute as well as me. This Unwillingness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and Aversion to undergo the general Fate, must have a juster</hi> Original, <hi>and flow from a more important Cause. I'm well satisfied that this other Being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52622:292"/>
that moves and actuates my Frame of Flesh and Blood, has a</hi> Life <hi>beyond it and the</hi> Grave; <hi>and something in it prompts me to believe its immortality. A</hi> Residence <hi>it must have somewhere else, when it has left this</hi> Carcase, <hi>and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> State <hi>to pass into, unchangeable and everlasting as it self after its</hi> Separation. <hi>This Condition must be good or bad ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its</hi> Actions <hi>and</hi> Deserts <hi>in this Life; for as it ows its</hi> Being <hi>to some</hi> Infinite Power <hi>that created it, I well suppose it his</hi> Vassal, <hi>and oblig'd to live by his</hi> Law; <hi>and as certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that according to the keeping or breaking of that</hi> Law, <hi>'tis to be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or punish'd hereafter. This Diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of</hi> Rewards <hi>and</hi> Punishments, <hi>makes the two Places,</hi> Heaven <hi>and</hi> Hell, <hi>so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mention'd in</hi> Scripture, <hi>and talk'd of

                  <p>
                     <hi>NO wonder if I am at a Loss to describe him, whom</hi> Nature <hi>was as much puzzled to make. 'Tis here as in</hi> Painting, <hi>where the most mishapen.</hi> Figures <hi>are the greatest</hi> Proofs <hi>of</hi> Skill. <hi>To draw a</hi> Thersites <hi>or</hi> AEsop <hi>well, requires the</hi> Pencil <hi>of</hi> Vandike <hi>or</hi> Titian, <hi>more than the best</hi> Features <hi>and</hi> Lineaments. <hi>All the Thoughts I can frame of him are as rude and indigested as himself. The very</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea <hi>and</hi> Conception <hi>of him are enough to cramp</hi> Grammar, <hi>to disturb</hi> Sence, <hi>and confound</hi> Syntax. <hi>He's a</hi> Solecism <hi>in the great</hi> Construction, <hi>therefore the best</hi> Description <hi>of him is</hi> Nonsence, <hi>and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52622:329" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the fittest</hi> Character <hi>to write it in, that</hi> Pot-hook-hand <hi>the Devil us'd at</hi> Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford <hi>in</hi> Queens Colledge-Library. <hi>He were</hi> Topick <hi>enough for convincing an</hi> Atheist <hi>that the World was made by Chance. The first</hi> Matter <hi>had more of</hi> Form <hi>and</hi> Order, <hi>the</hi> Chaos <hi>more of</hi> Symmetry <hi>and</hi> Proportion. <hi>I could call him</hi> Nature's By-blow, Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age <hi>and</hi> Abortive, <hi>or say, he is her</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo <hi>slink'd before</hi> Maturity; <hi>but that is stale and flat, and I must fly a higher Pitch to reach his</hi> Deformity. <hi>He is the ugliest she ever took Pains to make so, and</hi> Age <hi>to make worse. All the</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters <hi>of</hi> Africa <hi>lie kennell'd in his single</hi> Skin. <hi>He's one of the</hi> Grotesques <hi>of the</hi> Universe, <hi>whom the grand</hi> Artist <hi>drew only (as</hi> Painters <hi>do uncouth ugly</hi> Shapes) <hi>to fill up the empty</hi> Spaces <hi>and</hi>

Without doubt he was made to be laugh'd at, and design'd for the</hi> Scaramuchio <hi>of</hi> Mankind. <hi>When I see him, I can no more forbear than at sight of a</hi> Zany <hi>or</hi> Nokes; <hi>but am like to run the Risque of the</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, <hi>looking on an</hi> Ass <hi>mumbling</hi> Thistles. <hi>He's more ill-favour'd than the</hi> Picture <hi>of</hi> Winter <hi>drawn by a Fellow that dawbs</hi> Sign-Posts, <hi>more lowring than the last day of</hi> January. <hi>I have seen a handsomer</hi> Mortal <hi>carv'd in</hi> Monumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

Gingerbread, <hi>and woven in</hi> Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <hi>at</hi> Mortlock. <hi>If you have ever view'd that</hi> wooden Gentleman <hi>that peeps out of a Country</hi> Barber's <hi>Window, you may fancy some</hi> Resemblance <hi>of him. His damn'd squeezing</hi> Close-stool. Face <hi>can be liken'd to nothing better than the</hi> Buttocks <hi>of an old wrinkled</hi> Baboon, <hi>straining upon an</hi> Hillock. <hi>The very</hi> Sight <hi>of him in a morning would work with one beyond</hi> Jalap <hi>and</hi> Rhubarb. <hi>A</hi> Doctor <hi>(I'm told) once prescrib'd him to one of his</hi> Parishioners <hi>for a</hi> Purge: <hi>he wrought the</hi> Effect, <hi>and gave the</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>fourteen</hi> Stools. <hi>'Tis pity he is not drawn at the</hi> City Charges, <hi>and hung up in some publick</hi> Forica <hi>as a</hi> Remedy <hi>against</hi> Costiveness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Indeed by his</hi> Hue <hi>you might think he had been employed to that use: One

And now I should descend lower, if I durst venture: But I'll not defile my</hi> Pen: <hi>My</hi> Ink <hi>is too cleanly for a farther</hi> Description. <hi>I must beg my</hi> Reader<hi>'s Distance: as if I were going to Untruss. Should I mention what is beneath, the very</hi> Jakes <hi>would suffer by the</hi> Comparison, <hi>and 'twere enough to bring a</hi> Bog-house <hi>in Disgrace. Indeed he ought to have been drawn, like the good</hi> People <hi>on the</hi> Parliament-House, <hi>only from the</hi> Shoulders <hi>upwards. To me 'tis a greater</hi> Prodigy <hi>then himself, how his</hi> Soul <hi>has so long endured so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty a</hi> Lodging. <hi>Were there such a thing as a</hi> Metempsychosis, <hi>how gladly would it exchange its</hi> Carcase <hi>for that of the worst and</hi> vilest Brute: <hi>I'm suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently perswaded against the</hi> whim <hi>of</hi> Praeexistence; <hi>for any thing that had

the</hi> Pretense <hi>of</hi> Reason <hi>would never have entered such a</hi> Durance <hi>of</hi> Choice: <hi>Doubtless it must have been guilty of some unbeard of</hi> Sin, <hi>for which</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>dooms it</hi> Penance <hi>in the</hi> present Body, <hi>and ordains it its first</hi> Hell <hi>here. And 'tis disputable which may prove the worst, for 't has suffered half an</hi> Eternity <hi>already. Men can hardly tell which of the</hi> two <hi>will out-live the other. By his</hi> Face <hi>you'd guess him one of the</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, <hi>and that he liv'd before the</hi> Flood: <hi>His</hi> Head <hi>looks as if't had worn out</hi> three <hi>or</hi> four Bodies, <hi>and were Legacied to him by his</hi> Great-Grand-father. <hi>His</hi> Age <hi>is out of</hi> Knowledg, <hi>I believe he was born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> Registers <hi>were invented. He should have been a</hi> Ghost <hi>in Queen</hi> Mary's <hi>Days. I wonder</hi> Holingshead <hi>does not

speak of him. Every</hi> Limb <hi>about him is</hi> Chronicle: Par <hi>and</hi> John <hi>of the</hi> Times <hi>were</hi> short-Livers <hi>to him. They say, he can remember when</hi> Pauls <hi>was Founded, and</hi> London-Bridge <hi>built.
