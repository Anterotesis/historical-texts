            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <salute>Sir, Madam,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Take the boldness to present you
with these <hi>Narratives,</hi> not for
that they are new, or supposing
your selves to be strangers to them:
but as a Testimony of my Gratitude
for those favours I have received from
you: The high Heavens may be seen
<pb facs="tcp:41458:3"/>
in the lowest valleys: So may a large
heart in the least Gift. But truly
though the Gift be worthless, yet so is
not the matter contained in it, which
sets forth such eminent and signal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances
as no Church or people in
these latter Ages of the world have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
And there must be a recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of Gods mercies, or else there
will neither follow estimation, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution:
Hence <hi>Micah 6. 5. O my
people</hi> (saith God many hundreds of
years after) <hi>remember now what</hi>
Balack <hi>King of</hi> Moab <hi>consulted, and
what</hi> Balaam <hi>the Son of</hi> Beor <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
him from</hi> Shittim <hi>unto</hi> Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,
<hi>that ye may know the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of the Lord.</hi> If there be not
such a recognition of former deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
we that should be as Temples
of his praise, shall be as graves of his
benefits. Our souls indeed are too like
filthy Ponds, wherein fish die soon, and
frogs live long: Rotten stuff is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
memorable mercies are
<pb facs="tcp:41458:3"/>
forgotten; whereas the soul should be
as an holy Ark; the memory as the pot
of <hi>Manna,</hi> preserving holy truths and
special mercies; as <hi>Aarons Rod,</hi> fresh
and flourishing. Oh! let us imitate
that man after Gods own heart! If
the Lord will be <hi>Davids</hi> Shepherd,
he will dwell in Gods house to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity,
<hi>Psalm</hi> 23. 1, 6. If God deal
bountifully with him, he will sit down
and bethink himself what to render
for all his benefits, <hi>Psalm</hi> 116. 7, 12.
A Christian counts all that he can do
for God by way of retribution, but a
little of that much he could beteem
him; and thinks nothing more unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming
him than to bury the mercies
of God in oblivion. His two mites
of <hi>Thankfulness</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> he
daily presents, and then cryes out
as that poor <hi>Grecian</hi> did to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
<hi>If I had a better present
thou shouldest be sure of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What then may we judge of those
persons in our daies, who labour to
<pb facs="tcp:41458:4"/>
extenuate, yea annihilate these deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances?
that would have no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
commemorations of them, that
study how to invalidate them, and
to blot out the remembrance of them?
To render good for evil is Divine:
Good for good is Humane: Evil for
evil is brutish: But evil for good is
Devillish. Yet alas! how ordinary
an evil is this among us, to abuse
our deliverances to Gods dishonour?
But <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord,
O foolish people, and unwise?
Is not he thy Father? he hath
bought thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 6.
Should we not remember that good-turns
aggravate unkindnesses, and
our offences are not a little encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by our obligations? Ingrateful
persons are like the Snake in the
Fable, who said to the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
when he had shewed it kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
<hi>Summum praemium pro sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
beneficio est ingratitudo.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
<pb facs="tcp:41458:4"/>
is the greatest reward of the
greatest benefit.</p>
                  <p>How many such Snakes have we
amongst us, that return evil for good,
and unkindness for kindness? Is not
this to fight against God, with his
own weapons? as <hi>David</hi> did against
<hi>Goliah:</hi> as <hi>Jehu</hi> did against <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram:</hi>
and as <hi>Benhadad</hi> did against
<hi>Ahab,</hi> with that life that he had
lately given him? For the preventing
whereof (if it may be) are these
things published, being almost worn
out of remembrance more than the
very names of them. Besides, though
they may be found in larger Volumes,
yet are they not so fit for every Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily:
And as I have presumed
(honourable and beloved) to publish
them under your protection, so I doubt
not but they will find the better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
for the same. My earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
desire and prayer for you is, that
<hi>the God of Peace will fill you
<pb facs="tcp:41458:5"/>

and almost miraculous
Deliverance afforded by God
to this Nation from the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Invasion, Anno Christi
1588.</head>
                  <p>THE year one thousand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
eighty eight, was foretold
by an Astronomer of <hi>Konings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi>
above one hundred years before,
that it should prove a <hi>wonderful year:</hi> and
the <hi>German</hi> Chronologers presaged, that
it would be the <hi>Climacterical</hi> year of the
World, which was in some measure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
in that glorious and never to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41458:6"/>
be forgotten Deliverance vouchsafed by
God to us in <hi>England,</hi> and in that fatal
overthrow of the Spanish Navy; A true
Narrative whereof followes.</p>
                  <p>But that we may the better see what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to make this hostile In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion,
we must be informed; both who
were the inciters, and by what arguments,
&amp; artifices they stirred him up thereunto.</p>
                  <p>The Inciters were the Pope, and some
traiterous <hi>English</hi> Fugitives who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
in <hi>Spain,</hi> and at <hi>Rome.</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
was, <hi>The Conquest of England;</hi> which
had been hindred for the space of ten years
by reason of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Wars in <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</hi>
The Arguments were, that seeing
God had blessed the King of <hi>Spain</hi> with
admirable Blessings and Successes; had
given him in <hi>Portugal,</hi> the <hi>East-Indies,</hi>
and very many rich Islands belonging to
the same; that he should therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
somewhat that might be acceptable
to God (the giver of so great and good
things) and most worthy the Power, and
Majesty of the Catholick King: That the
Church of God could not be more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
nor meritoriously propagated, than
by the Conquest of <hi>England,</hi> extirpating
Heresie, and planting the Catholick Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Religion there. This War (they said)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41458:6"/>
would be most just and necessary; conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that the Queen of <hi>England</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated,
and persisted contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
against the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> That
she supported the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Rebels
in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> annoyed the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
with continual depredations; surprised,
and sacked his Towns in <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi>
and had very lately put the Queen
of <hi>Scots</hi> to death, therein violating the
Majesty of all Kings.</p>
                  <p>Again, that this War would be no less
profitable than just; For hereby he might
add to his Empire other flourishing
Kingdoms, extinguish the Rebellion in the
<hi>Low-Countries,</hi> hitherto fomented and
supported from <hi>England;</hi> secure his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
from both the <hi>Indies,</hi> and abate his
vast expences in Convoying his <hi>Indian</hi>
Fleets both forward and backward: For
proof whereof (they suggested) that the
<hi>English</hi> Navy was neither for number,
nor greatness, nor strength comparable to
that of <hi>Spain;</hi> especially having the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi>
Fleet now annexed unto it. That
<hi>England</hi> was not fortified, and it wanted
Commanders: Souldiers, a Cavalry,
and Ammunition; was bare of Wealth,
and Friends. That there were many in
all parts of it addicted to the <hi>Romish</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41458:7"/>
and would upon the first opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
joyn their forces with his. In brief,
that so great was the strength of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi>
and so unmatchable was their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
that no man durst oppose against
them, and therefore they might confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
assure themselves of victory. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
that now an opportunity was afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God himself to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to
effectuate this great design, having no
cause to fear any other Enemies, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of a Truce lately concluded by him
with the Great <hi>Turk,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> (his
old Enemies) being now embroiled in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Wars at home. They perswaded him
likewise that <hi>England</hi> was an easier Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
than the <hi>Netherlands:</hi> For that he
had a shorter cut to it by Sea, and that an
open Sea: neither was it so fortified with
Cities, Castles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the <hi>Netherlands</hi>
were: and that <hi>England</hi> being once Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
the <hi>Netherlands</hi> would soon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of course, having lost their best Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter.</p>
                  <p>These, and such like arguments prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in the next
place they held a serious Consultation
about the manner of Invading <hi>England.
Don Alvares Bassano,</hi> Marquiss of <hi>Sancta
Cruce,</hi> who was to Command the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mado,</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41458:7"/>
advised that some Port-Town in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
or <hi>Zealand,</hi> should suddenly be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
by the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Land For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(who was then Governor of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands</hi>
under the King of <hi>Spain)</hi> and by
some <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships sent to assist him by
Sea, that so the great Fleet might have an
Harbour from whence to begin their Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
with whom agreed in opinion the
Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> himself, who was very
forward to promote this expedition. But
others opposed this by reason of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
danger, expence of time, and vast
charge that it would require. They held
that with the same charge <hi>England</hi> might
easier be won, and that the Conquest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
would be assured, if a well-appointed
Army out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries</hi>
might be landed at the <hi>Thames</hi> mouth,
and <hi>London</hi> (the Metropolis of <hi>England)</hi>
surprised by a sudden Assault. And this
opinion, as the more probable, prevailed.
And then again it was advised by some,
that War should first be denounced by an
Herald, both to remove suspicion and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
from neighbour Princes, and to
drive our Queen to call in Foreign Forces
to assist Her: hoping that according to
the insolent manner of mercenaries, they
would raise mutinies, and spoil the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41458:8"/>
which would make the Queens Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
evil affected towards Her; so that all
things would grow into confusion in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
But this motion was not hearkened
to by men grown fierce, insolent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of their own strength, only they
desired the blessing of the Pope upon their
<hi>Armado,</hi> and the Prayers of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
to God and the Saints for good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.
And to strike the greater terror into
the hearts of the <hi>English,</hi> They set forth
Books with printed Maps, wherein was
expressed the greatness of their Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in each particular, which indeed was
so great in <hi>Spain, Portugal, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
at it, and procured the Pope to
Christen it by the name of the <hi>Invincible
Armado.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that the wonderful power and
mercy of God to us in this poor Nation,
in protecting us against the same, may the
more gloriously appear, I shall in the next

and two thousand and eighty eight
Gally-slaves. And so confident were the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> that <hi>England</hi> should pay the shot,
that they spared no cost for furnishing it
forth with all things necessary. For which
end they provided of Bullets for great shot
two hundred and twenty thousand. Of

Kintals: of Match a thousand and two

Bread and Bisket ready baked, and Wine
laid aboard for six months provision. They
had moreover six thousand &amp; five hundred

Kintals of Bacon; three thousand of Cheese,
besides other Flesh, Rise, Beans, Pease, Oil,
and Vinegar, with twelve thousand Pipes

Torches, Lamps, and Lanthorns, Canvas,

and Butcherly Knives to murder and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the poor <hi>English.</hi> In a word, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was thirty two thousand strong, and
cost the King of <hi>Spain</hi> thirty two thousand
Ducats every day.</p>
                  <p>In this Army were five Regiments of
old <hi>Spanish</hi> Souldiers of the Tertio's of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
Sicily,</hi> and the <hi>Tercera's,</hi> Commanded
by five Masters <hi>Del-Campo:</hi> The first was
Don <hi>Diego de Piementel,</hi> a Knight of the
Order of Saint <hi>John,</hi> and Brother to the
Marquess of <hi>Taveras:</hi> The second Colonel
was Don <hi>Francisco de Toledo,</hi> Brother to
the Earl of <hi>Orgas:</hi> The third Don <hi>Alonzo
de Luzon:</hi> The fourth Don <hi>Nicholas de Illa:</hi>
The fifth was <hi>Augustin Mexia;</hi> each Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
having in his Regiment thirty two
Companies, Besides the <hi>Castilian,</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi>
Bands, each of them having their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Commanders and Weapons.</p>
                  <p>The General of this mighty Army (the
Marquess of <hi>Sancta Cruce</hi> being now dead)
was Don <hi>Lodovicus Peres,</hi> the Duke of
<hi>Med na Sidonia</hi> of the Order of the <hi>Golden
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41458:10"/>
Fleece.</hi> The Admiral was Don <hi>John Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinez
de Richald:</hi> The Marshal Don <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco
Bovadille:</hi> Others were chief Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors
for the War, and Don <hi>Martin Alar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
was Vicar General for the holy unholy
Inquisition, in whose train were a hundred
Monks and Jesuites: and Cardinal <hi>Allen</hi>
was appointed the Superintendent of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
matters throughout <hi>England,</hi> who
fearing to be unprovided, translated Pope
<hi>Sixtus</hi> his Bull into <hi>English,</hi> that it might
be the sooner published upon the arrival of
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet in this our Nation. Of
voluntary Adventurers, there were a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twenty four Noblemen, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of all the greatest Houses in <hi>Spain,</hi>
hoping to be well paid with the Lands and
Riches of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> also in the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi>
by the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Command,
built Ships, and very many flat bottomed
Boats, each of them big enough to carry
thirty Horse, with Bridges fitted to them
to Ship and unship the Horses: He hired
Mariners from <hi>East-Germany,</hi> set many
thousands on work to dig and deepen Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
from <hi>Antwerp</hi> to <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and to <hi>Bruges:</hi>
lading three hundred small Boats with Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
and Victuals. Two hundred more
flat-bottom'd Boats were made, though
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41458:11"/>
not so big as the former, which lay ready
in the Haven of <hi>Newport,</hi> besides thirty se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Ships of War at <hi>Dunkirk:</hi> He prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Piles sharpened at the nether ends,
headed with Iron, and hooked on the sides
to pile up the mouths of Rivers: At
<hi>Graveling</hi> he provided twenty thousand
empty Casks with Cords, and other furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to make floating Bridges to stop up
the Heavens, beside an infinite number of
Fagots: He shipped likewise a great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Saddles, Bridles, with other furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for Horse, and Horses also for Carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
with Ordance and other provisions
for War.</p>
                  <p>Near unto <hi>Newport</hi> he had lying under
the command of <hi>Camillo</hi> thirty Companies
of <hi>Italians,</hi> two of <hi>Walloons,</hi> and eight of
<hi>Burguignons,</hi> every Company containing a
hundred men: At <hi>Dyxmew</hi> he mustered
eight Companies of <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> sixty
of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> sixty of <hi>High Dutch,</hi> among
which were seven hundred Fugitive <hi>English</hi>
under the Command of Sir <hi>William Stanley,</hi>
who of all others were held in greatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:
neither was <hi>Stanley,</hi> nor the Earl
of <hi>Westmoorland,</hi> nor others which offered
their service and counsel once heard, but for
their treachery to their Country barred
from all access, and as most unfortunate
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41458:11"/>
conductors, worthily with detestation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.
At <hi>Conick</hi> also he quartered other
four thousand, and at <hi>Watene</hi> nine hundred
Horse, Commanded by the Marquess of
<hi>Guast.</hi> And to this Land-service came the
Duke of <hi>Pastrana,</hi> supposed to be the King
of <hi>Spains</hi> base Son: the Marquess of <hi>Buor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi>
one of the Duke <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Sons: Don
<hi>Vespasian Gonsago</hi> of the House of <hi>Mantua,</hi>
a great Souldier, who had been Viceroy of
<hi>Spain:</hi> Don <hi>John de Medices,</hi> Bastard of
<hi>Florence:</hi> Don <hi>Amadeus,</hi> Bastard of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
with many others of the like quality.</p>
                  <p>Neither was <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> Pope of
<hi>Rome,</hi> any ways backward to shew his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
and devotion to this intended Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
but sent abroad his <hi>Crusado</hi> (as he
used to do against the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels)</hi>
wherein out of the treasure of the Church
he gave plenary Indulgences, and pardon
of all their sins to every one that contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his assistance hereunto: and for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance
of this enterprise, himself under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to contribute a million of Gold, the
one half presently down, the other half
when any notable Haven in our land should
be won: yet with this <hi>Proviso,</hi> that the
Crown of <hi>England</hi> should be held as Feuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to the See of <hi>Rome:</hi> in earnest whereof
he bestowed upon the King of <hi>Spain</hi> his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41458:12"/>
postolical Benediction, and the Title of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
of the Faith:</hi> He sent also Cardinal
<hi>Allen</hi> into the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and renewed
the Bulls of <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth and <hi>Gregory</hi> the
thirteenth, whereby Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was
excommunicated, deposed from her Throne,
and her Subjects absolved from all allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to her.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see what preparations were
made both at Sea and Land, at <hi>Rome,</hi> in
<hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> for the subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>England,</hi> extirpating the Gospel, and
subjugating us under the yoke of <hi>Spain:</hi>
now let us see what provision and prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
our Queen made to dispel this black
Cloud that hung over our head: And truly
the first thing that she did was most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
For as when <hi>Jehosophat</hi> was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the like danger, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 20. 3. He
sought the Lord and proclaimed a Fast; so
did She, requiring all her Subjects to humble
themselves by Fasting and Prayer, knowing
that these are the best Weapons of the
Church, that they by them might seek unto
the Lord, and say in the words of <hi>Jehosophat,
O Lord God, art not thus God in Heaven?
and rulest not thou over all the Kingdoms of
the Earth? and in thine hand is there not
power and might, so that none is able to
withstand thee? O our God, wilt thou not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41458:12"/>
judge them? For we have no might against
this great company that cometh against us,
neither know we what to do, but our eyes are
upon thee.</hi> But in the second place, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Prayers without endeavours and
means are like <hi>Rachel, beautiful but barren,</hi>
that She might not be taken unprovided,
She prepared with all diligence as strong a
Fleet as She could, and all things necessary
for War; and She that in discerning mens
parts and abilities was of a most sharp judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ever most happy, having the free
choice in her self, and not by the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of others, assigned to every office by
name the best and fittest men.</p>
                  <p>The charge of her Navy She committed
to <hi>Charles Howard</hi> of <hi>Effingham,</hi> Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
of <hi>England,</hi> of whose skill She had had
former experience, and whom She knew
both by his Moderation and Nobility, to
be wary in providence, valiant, industrious,
and of great authority among the Seamen,
and well beloved of them: Her Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
She made the famous Sir <hi>Francis
Drake,</hi> and these She sent to the West parts
of <hi>England;</hi> and for the Guard of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Seas, She appointed <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>
second Son to the Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi>
whom She commanded also to lie upon the
Coasts of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> with forty
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41458:13"/>
Ships, to watch that the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>
might not come forth with his Forces: By
Land She commanded the General Forces
of the Realm to be mustered, trained, and put
in readiness in their special Shires, for the
defence of the whole, which accordingly
was done, and whereof the Lord <hi>Robert
Dudley</hi> Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> was appointed
Lieutenant; twenty thousand whereof
were disposed along our South-Coast for
the guard thereof: besides which, She had
two Armies; one of which consisting of a
thousand Horse, and twenty two thousand
Foot, was encamped at <hi>Tilbury</hi> near the
<hi>Thames</hi> mouth, whither the Enemy fully
intended to come: The other which was
led by the Lord <hi>Hunsdon,</hi> consisted of thirty
four thousand Foot, and two thousand
Horse, which were to be the Guard of the
Queens person: Her self in courage far
surmounting her Sex, as another <hi>Zenobia</hi>
or rather <hi>Deborah,</hi> led forth the Lords
Host against this great <hi>Sisera,</hi> and her Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
valiant and skilful, both for courage
and quick dispatch, might well be compared
to those <hi>Gadites</hi> that came to aid <hi>David,</hi>
whose faces were like the faces of Lions,
and were compared to the Roes in the
Mountains for swiftness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arthur</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Knolles,</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:41458:13"/>
Sir <hi>John Knorris,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Bingham,</hi> and
Sir <hi>Roger Williams,</hi> all gallant men, and
brave Souldiers, were appointed to consult
about managing the Land Service: These
advised that all the commodious landing
places for the Enemy, as well from <hi>Spain,</hi>
as from the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> should be man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and fortified, as <hi>Milford</hi> Haven, <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,
Plimmouth, Portland,</hi> the <hi>Isle of
Weight, Portsmouth,</hi> the open Coast of <hi>Kent,</hi>
commonly called the <hi>Downs,</hi> the <hi>Thames</hi>
mouth, <hi>Harwich, Yarmouth, Hull,</hi> &amp;c.
and that the Trained Bands throughout the
Coast Shires, should meet upon a signal
given to defend the said places, and do
their best to prohibit the Enemies landing.
But in case he should land, that then they
should leave all the Country round about
wast, that so they might find nothing for
food, but what from their Ships they should
carry upon their shoulders, and that they
should hold the Enemies busied both night
and day with continual Alarms, but not to
hazard a Battel till more Commanders with
their Companies were come together.</p>
                  <p>Some suggested also to the Queen, that
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> abroad were not so much to
be feared as the Papists at home; for that
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not attempt the Invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>England,</hi> but upon confidence of aid
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41458:14"/>
from them: She thereupon committed some
of them to Prison at <hi>Wisbeach</hi> in the Fenns;
by her Letters also She directed Sir <hi>William
Fitz-Williams,</hi> Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> what
he should do.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Scots</hi> She put in mind to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of the Papists and Spanish Factions:
By her frequent Letters She wrote to the
States of the <hi>Vnited Provinces</hi> not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
in assisting her what they could.</p>
                  <p>But amongst these preparations for War
on both sides, <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to cast a
mist over her Majesties eyes, and to rock her
into a sleep of security, importuned by all
means the Realms unto peace, imploying
the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> to be his instrument
therein, who dealt earnestly by Letters with
the help of Sir <hi>James Crofts,</hi> a privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor,
and a man much addicted to peace,
as also by <hi>Andrew Van Loey,</hi> a <hi>Netherlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
that a Treaty of Peace might be entred
upon, affirming that he had Warrant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
from the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Our Queen
measuring other Princes by her own guile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
heart, gave ear to this deceitful lullaby,
little suspecting that a deadly Snake could
be hid in so fair a Garden; yet resolved to
treat of Peace with her Sword in her hand,
neither was the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> against her
so doing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:41458:14"/>
In the month therefore of <hi>February</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
were sent into <hi>Flanders, Henry</hi>
Earl of <hi>Darby, William Brook,</hi> Lord <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
Sir <hi>James Crofts, Valentine Dale,</hi> and
<hi>John Rogers</hi> Doctors of the Law, who arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
there, were received in the Prince of
<hi>Parma</hi>'s name with all courtesy; who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
sent away <hi>Dale</hi> presently to him to
know where the place of meeting should
be, and to see his Commission from the
King of <hi>Spain:</hi> the place he appointed to
be near <hi>Ostend,</hi> the Town it self being then
in the <hi>English</hi> hands; and as for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
he promised it should be produced
at their meeting: Only he wished them to
hasten the matter, lest any thing should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in the interim to interrupt the Treaty:
and one <hi>Richardot,</hi> which stood by him,
said more openly, <hi>That he knew not what in
the mean time might be done against</hi> England.
Which being reported to the Queen, She
sent <hi>Rogers</hi> to the Prince to know whether
there was any design for the Invading of
<hi>England,</hi> as he, and <hi>Richardot</hi> by their words
seemed to imply: The Prince answered
that he had never any thought for the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>England,</hi> when he wished the Treaty
to be hastened, and was angry with <hi>Richar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dot,</hi>
who denied that any such words had
fallen from him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:41458:15"/>
Commissioners for the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
were <hi>Maximilian</hi> Earl of <hi>Aremberg,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of <hi>Antwerp, Richardot</hi> President of
<hi>Artois,</hi> with some other Civilians.</p>
                  <p>These stayed at <hi>Bruges,</hi> and for all their
pretended haste, much time was cunningly
spun out about the place of their meeting,
which should have the Precedency, and
what hostages should be given for security
of the Commissioners: yet at length the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> yielded to the <hi>English</hi> Precedency,
both in going and sitting: and the place
was in Tents near unto <hi>Ostend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The demands for the Queen were, that
there might be a surcease of Arms, with a
present and undelayed Truce, She mitrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Spanish</hi> preparations at Sea: The
sending away of foreign Souldiers out of
the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> for <hi>Englands</hi> security: A
restitution of such sums of money as the
Queen had lent to the States, and which the
King had promised to restore: That the
<hi>Netherlanders</hi> might enjoy their ancient
liberties, and priviledges, nor be governed
by a stranger, but by a Native Prince: That
they might have liberty to serve God with
Freedom of Conscience: And lastly, that
the Articles of the Pacification of <hi>Gaunt,</hi>
and other like treaties might be observed;
which things if they were granted, She
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41458:15"/>
would condescend upon reasonable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to deliver up the Towns in the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi>
which She then had in possession, that
it might appear that she had not for her own
advantage, but for the necessary defence of
the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and her self taken up arms.</p>
                  <p>To these the <hi>Spaniards</hi> replyed, that
touching their preparations at Sea, they did
assure them that it nothing concerned <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
That to send away the Souldiers,
the King could not resolve till the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
had submitted themselves to him.
Concerning their priviledges, that it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
nothing to the Queen, neither should
She prescribe to the King a Law. And so
far was he from tolerating Religion, that
he would not so much as hear thereof, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
than he had allowed to other
Towns that had submitted to his obedience:
And as for those Towns which had been
taken from the King, and the mony expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
about them, They said that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>
might demand as many Myriades of
Ducats to be repayed to him by the Queen,
as he had expended upon the <hi>Low-Country</hi>
War, from the time that She supported the
revolting <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> and took them into
her Protection.</p>
                  <p>About this time went <hi>Dale</hi> by the
Queens command to the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:41458:16"/>
and mildly expostulated with him about a
Book lately published by Cardinal <hi>Allen,</hi>
that <hi>English Renegado,</hi> wherein he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Nobility and People of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Ireland</hi> to joyn with the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces,
under the Conduct of the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi>
to execute the Popes sentence already pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
by his <hi>Bull</hi> against Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi>
wherein she was declared an Heretick, Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate,
cruel, for putting to death the
Queen of <hi>Scots, &amp;c.</hi> And her Subjects ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
from their Oath of Allegiance, and
commanded to aid the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Her. (And indeed there was a great
number of these <hi>Bulls</hi> and Books printed at
<hi>Antwerp,</hi> from thence to be dispersed all
over <hi>England.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prince denied that he had ever seen
any such Book, or <hi>Bull,</hi> neither would he
undertake any thing in the Popes name;
howbeit that he must obey his Prince. But
for the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> he prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
that he did so honour her for her
Vertues, that next to the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
he esteemed Her above all others, and
would be ready to do Her service. For the
manifestation whereof he said that he had
perswaded the King to condescend to this
treaty of peace, which would be more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
for the <hi>English</hi> than for the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41458:16"/>
For</hi> (said he) <hi>if the</hi> Spaniards <hi>be
overcome they will soon recover their loss; but
if You be overcome, your Kingdom, and all is
lost:</hi> To which <hi>Dale</hi> made this reply: <hi>Our
Queen is provided with strength sufficient
to defend her Kingdom, and you your self
in your wisdom may foresee that a Kingdom
cannot be lost with the fortune of one Battel;
seeing the King of</hi> Spain <hi>after so long Wars,
is not able to recover his ancient inheritance
in the</hi> Netherlánds. Be it so (said the Prince)
These things are in the hands of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
                  <p>After this the Commissioners contended
with mutual debates, and replies, still twist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and untwisting the same thread. For
when the <hi>English</hi> pressed that a Toleration
of Religion might be granted for the <hi>Vnited
Provinces,</hi> at least for two years; It was
answered, That as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> demanded
not this for the <hi>English</hi> Catholicks; so they
hoped the Queen in her Wisdom would
require nothing of him which might be
against the Honour, Oath, and Conscience
of the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> When they demanded the
mony due from the States of <hi>Brabant</hi> to
our Queen; They answered, that it was
lent without the Kings Knowledge or War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;
and that the accounts being cast up,
how much the said mony was, and how
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41458:17"/>
much the King had disbursed about the
War, it would soon be known to whom
the most ought to be repayed. With such
answers as these they dallied with the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Commissioners, till the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet
was come within the view of <hi>England,</hi>
and the thundring of the Ordnance was
heard from the Sea, which put the <hi>English</hi>
Commissioners into some suspicion and fear,
having no hostages for their safe return. But
they received a safe conduct from the Prince
of <hi>Parma</hi> (who had in the mean time
drawn down all his Forces to the Sea-Coast)
and so were conducted to the borders near
<hi>Calice.</hi> Thus came this Treaty to nothing,
undertaken by our Queen (as was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
to divert the coming of the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Fleet: and continued by the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to
surprize <hi>England</hi> unprovided, and at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.
So both sides put the Foxes skin
upon the Lions head.</p>
                  <p>And now we are come to speak of this
<hi>Invincible Armado,</hi> which was the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of five whole years at least. It bare
it self also upon Divine assistance, having
received a special Blessing from the Pope,
and was assigned as an <hi>Apostolical Mission</hi>
for the reducement of this Kingdom to the
obedience of the See of <hi>Rome:</hi> and in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
token of this holy Warfare, there were
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41458:17"/>
amongst the rest of the Ships, <hi>twelve,</hi> called
by the names of the <hi>twelve Apostles.</hi> The
Gallions and Galliasses were of such a vast
size, that they were like floating Towers
and Castles, so that the swelling waves of
the Sea could hardly be seen; and the Flags,
Streamers, and Ensigns so spread in the
wind, that they seemed even to darken the
Sun, and to threaten destruction which way
soever they turned.</p>
                  <p>On the nine and twentieth day of <hi>May</hi>
this Fleet set Sail out of the River <hi>Tayo,</hi>
bending its course towards the <hi>Groin</hi> in
<hi>Galizia,</hi> the place appointed for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Rendezvous, as being the nearest Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto <hi>England:</hi> But whilest they hoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and spread abroad their proud Sailes to
the wind; God, who is an Enemy to such
<hi>Nimrod-like</hi> undertakings, and hating such
hostile actions, suddenly manifested his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
and poured out revenge by a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and hideous tempest, which drave the
Duke of <hi>Medina,</hi> the General, back again
into the <hi>Groin;</hi> eight other of the Ships
being dispersed on the Seas, had their Masts
broken, and blown over board; besides
three other <hi>Portugal</hi> Gallies which were
driven upon the Coasts of <hi>Bayon</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
where, by the valour of one <hi>David Gwin,</hi>
an <hi>English</hi> slave, and the help of other
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41458:18"/>
slaves, <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> they were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
into the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> and
they freed themselves by the slaughter of
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> amongst whom <hi>Don Diego
de Mondrana</hi> was one.</p>
                  <p>About the same time the <hi>English</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and Vice-Admiral, who had in all about
one hundred Ships, whereof fifteen were
Victuallers, and nine Voluntaries of <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>
Gentlemen, hearing for certainty that
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet was ready to hoise up their
Sails, resolved to put forth from <hi>Plymouth,</hi>
and to meet, and fight them by the way;
but were so met with by the same wind,
that they could not get past the <hi>Syllies,</hi> and
thence also were forced by the Tempest
to return into their former Harbour, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
their Ships, and Companies; only
some of their Scouts at Sea descried some of
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships, which likewise had been
dispersed with the storm: but before the
<hi>English</hi> could come near them, the wind
veering about, carryed them back to the
<hi>Groine,</hi> where the rest of their Fleet lay
in Harbour.</p>
                  <p>Intelligence being brought that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
were in want, their great Ships dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed,
and the rest sorely shaken with the
storm, and their men dying by multitudes
of the Pestilence; the Lord Admiral <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:41458:18"/>
intended with the first Northerly wind
to take advantage, which coming about
upon the eighth of <hi>July,</hi> he lanched forth,
and bore his Sails almost within the sight of
<hi>Spain,</hi> purposing to surprise their weather-beaten
Ships, and to fight them upon their
own Coast. But then the wind suddenly
changing into the South, and he wisely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
that the Enemy might pass by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his discovery, that the Seas might be
stormy, or his Fleet wind-bound, and that
whilst he thus lay abroad, his service might
be more necessary at home, and that his
work was to defend the Coasts of <hi>England,</hi>
he therefore presently returned and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored
his Fleet in the Haven at <hi>Plimouth,</hi>
suffering his men to refresh themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Land.</p>
                  <p>At the same time there came more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
advertisement (though false) not
only to the Lord Admiral, but to the Court,
that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet could not possibly
come forth again that year, upon which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
(a dangerous matter in State affairs)
so confident was our Queen, that She sent
for four of her biggest Royal Ships to be
brought back to <hi>Chattam:</hi> But the Lord
Admiral suspecting the worst, by a mild
and moderate answer retarded it, desiring
that nothing might be lightly believed in so
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41458:19"/>
weighty a matter, and that he might retain
them though at his own charge. Wherein
indeed a special providence of God did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
for just at that time news was brought
to the Lord Admiral by one Captain <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Flemming,</hi> that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet was
entred into the <hi>British</hi> Seas, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Channel,</hi> and was seen near unto the
<hi>Lizard-point,</hi> which came thus to pass.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships being new rigged, and
their wants supplyed, their King still hot on
his former resolutions, instantly urged and
hastened his Commanders to put forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to Sea, which accordingly they did
upon the eleventh of <hi>July</hi> with the same
South wind which (as was said before)
brought back our Navy into <hi>Plimouth,</hi>
and so having a more favourable Gale, with
brave shews, and full Sails, they entred our
Channel, where casting Anchor, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
certain small Pinnaces to the Prince
of <hi>Parma,</hi> to signifie their arrival and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness,
and to command him in the name of
their King to forward his charge for that
service.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> the twentieth about noon, this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Fleet was descried by the <hi>English,</hi>
coming forward amain with a South-west
wind. It was a kind of surprise: For that
(as was said) many of our men were gone
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41458:19"/>
to land, and our Ships ready to depart:
Nevertheless our undaunted Admiral tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forth such Ships as he could get in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
into the deep Sea, not without great
difficulty, certainly with singular diligence,
and admirable alacrity of our Mariners,
cheered up with the Admirals own presence
and assistance among them at their halser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,
the wind blowing strongly into the
Haven.</p>
                  <p>When they were forth they saw the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Ships with lofty Towers like Castles,
in front like an half-moon, the horns where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
stretched forth in breadth about seven
miles, sayling (as it were) with labour to
the winds, the Ocean groaning under them;
so that though with full sails, yet they came
but slowly forward. They seemed as it
were to make for <hi>Plymouth;</hi> but whether
their Commission was otherwise, or because
contrary to their expectation, they saw the
<hi>English</hi> Ships out of the Harbour, they steer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by towards <hi>Calice,</hi> hoping to meet with
the Prince of <hi>Parma:</hi> the <hi>English</hi> willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suffered them to pass by, that they might
the more commodiously chase them in the
Reer with a fore-right wind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> the twenty first, the Lord Admiral
of <hi>England</hi> sent before him a Pinnace called
the <hi>Defiance,</hi> to denounce War by dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41458:20"/>
her Ordnance, himself following in
the <hi>Ark-Royal,</hi> set upon the Admiral (as he
thought) of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but it proved to
be <hi>Alonzo de Leva</hi>'s Ship, where fire, smoke,
and loud thundring Cannons began the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley;
and rending Bullets most freely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchanged
betwixt them, were fiery Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
of each others minds. Soon after
came up <hi>Drake, Hawkins,</hi> and <hi>Forbusher,</hi>
playing with their Ordnance upon the hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Squadron of the Enemies, which was
commanded by <hi>Rechalde,</hi> who laboured all
he could to stay his Men from flying for
shelter to the Fleet, till his own Ship being
much battered with shot, and now grown
unserviceable, was with much difficulty
drawn into the main Fleet. At which time
the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> gathered together his
whole Fleet, scattered here and there by the
<hi>English,</hi> and hoising more Sail, kept on his
intended course toward <hi>Callice;</hi> neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
could he do otherwise, the wind fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
the <hi>English,</hi> and himself finding
the inconvenience of their great and high
built Ships, powerful to defend, but not to
offend; to stand, but not to move; whereas
on the contrary their enemies were nimble,
and ready on all sides to annoy them, and
as apt to escape harms themselves, being
low built and so easily shot over. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41458:20"/>
he caused them to gather themselves
up close in the form of an half-moon, and
to slacken their Sails that their whole Fleet
might keep together. But our <hi>English</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
having maintained an hot fight for
the space of two hours, thought not good to
continue it any longer, thirty of his Ships
scarce coming to the work, the rest being
as yet scarce gotten out of the Harbour.</p>
                  <p>In this first days fight the Saint <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi>
a <hi>Spanish</hi> Ship, having been sorely bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
and much torn, was taken into the
middest of their Fleet to be repaired: And
an huge Ship of <hi>Biscaie</hi> of Don <hi>Oquendoes,</hi>
in which was a great part of the Kings trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
began to be all in a Flame by force of
Gunpowder, which was fired on purpose by
a <hi>Flemish</hi> Gunner, for being misused by
them: But the fire was soon quenched by
the assistance of some other Ships sent in to
her help. All this while the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for
want of Courage (which they called Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission)
did what they could to decline the
Fight, casting themselves continually into
Roundels (their strongest Ships walling in
the rest) in which posture they made a fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
march towards <hi>Callice:</hi> yet in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
medly a great Gallion, wherein was
Don <hi>Pedro de Valdez, Vasques de Silva, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenzo
de Saias,</hi> with other Noble men,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41458:21"/>
being sore battered with the <hi>English</hi> shot,
in avoyding whereof she fell foul upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Ship, and ere she could be cleared
had her Fore-mast broken off, which so
hindred her Sailing, that she was unable to
keep way with the rest of the Fleet, nor
were their friends of courage to succour
these distressed Lords, but left both Ship
and them in this sudden and unexpected
danger. But the night coming on, our
Lord Admiral supposing that they had left
neither men nor Mariners aboard within
her, and fearing to lose sight of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
past by her, and followed the Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn
which he supposed to be carried by Sir
<hi>Francis Drake,</hi> as it was appointed, but
that brave Knight was eagerly pursuing five
great Hulks which he took to be of the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> but when he came up, and haled
them, they proved <hi>Easterlings</hi> and friends,
and so were dismissed: yet by this mistake
of his, the greatest part of our Fleet, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the direction of his light, was forced
to lye still: so that he and the rest of the
Fleet till towards night, the next day, could
not recover sight of the Lord Admiral,
who all the night before with two other
Ships, the <hi>Bear</hi> and the <hi>Mary-Rose</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Spanish Lanthorn.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> the twenty second; Sir <hi>Francis
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41458:21"/>
Drake</hi> espied the aforementioned lagging
Gallion, whereupon he sent forth a Pinnace
to command them to yield, otherwise his
bullets without any delay should force
them to it: <hi>Valdes,</hi> to seem valorous, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that they were four hundred and
fifty strong; that himself was Don <hi>Pedro,</hi>
and stood on his honour, and thereupon
propounded certain conditions: But the
Knight returned this reply, that he had no
leisure to parley, if he would immediately
yield, so; otherwise he should soon prove
that <hi>Drake</hi> was no Dastard. <hi>Pedro</hi> hearing
that it was the fiery <hi>Drake</hi> (whose name was
very terrible to the <hi>Spaniards)</hi> that had
him in chase, presently yielded, and with
forty of his Companions, came on board
Sir <hi>Francis</hi> his Ship, where first giving
him the <hi>Conge,</hi> he protested that he and
all his were resolved to have dyed fighting,
had they not fallen into his hands, whose
valour and felicity was so great, that <hi>Mars</hi>
and <hi>Neptune</hi> seemed to wait on him in all
his attempts, and whose noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
mind towards the vanquished, had
often been experienced even of his greatest
Foes. Sir <hi>Francis</hi> to requite his <hi>Spanish</hi>
Complements with <hi>English</hi> Courtesie, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him at his own Table, and lodged him
in his own Cabin: the residue of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41458:22"/>
he sent to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
Prisoners for the space of eighteen
months, till by payment of their ransoms
they obtained their liberty: But <hi>Drakes</hi>
Souldiers had well paid themselves by the
plunder of the Ship, wherein they found
55000 Ducats of Gold, which they merrily
shared amongst them. The same day <hi>Michael
de Oquendo,</hi> Admiral of the Squadron <hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pusco,</hi>
and Vice-Admiral of the whole
Fleet, suffered no less a disaster; whose
Ship being one of the greatest Gallions, fell
on fire, and all the upper part of the Ship
being burnt, most also of the persons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
were consumed: howbeit the Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the hold not taking fire, the Ship fell
into the hands of the <hi>English,</hi> which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the scorched <hi>Spaniards</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
was brought into <hi>Plimouth,</hi> a joyful
spectacle to the beholders. All this day, the
Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> laboured securely to set
his Fleet in order; To <hi>Alphonso de Leva</hi>
he gave in charge to joyne the first and last
Squadron together; To every Ship he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
his quarter to ride in according to
the form prescribed in <hi>Spain,</hi> commanding
them upon pain of death not to desert their
stations. <hi>Glitch,</hi> an Ensign-bearer, he sent
to the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> to acquaint him
with his condition.</p>

                     <hi>July</hi> the twenty third, early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> taking the benefit of a
Northerly wind, when they approached
right against <hi>Portland,</hi> turned about against
the <hi>English;</hi> but the <hi>English,</hi> nimble, and
foreseeing all advantages, soon turned aside
to the Westward, each striving to get the
wind of the other, which at last the <hi>English</hi>
got, and so they prepared themselves on
each side to Fight; and the <hi>English</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
all day from morning till night to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
those wooden Castles with great and
small shot: The fight was very confused and
variable, whilst on the one side the <hi>English</hi>
bravely rescued the <hi>London</hi> Ships that were
hemmed in by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and on the
other side the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as stoutly delivered
<hi>Rechalde</hi> being in danger: Never was there
heard greater thundring of Ordnance on
both sides, the chiefest fight being perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
on this day; yet notwithstanding the
shot from the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships for the most
part flew over the <hi>English</hi> without hurting
them, only <hi>Cock</hi> an <hi>English man</hi> dyed with
honour in the midst of his Enemies in a little
Ship of his. The <hi>English</hi> Ships being far
the lesser, charged that <hi>Sea-Gyant</hi> with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
agility, and having given them
their broad sides, flew off again presently,
and then coming up, levelled their shot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41458:23"/>
without missing those heavy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weildy
Ships of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But the
Lord Admiral would not hazard a fight
by grappling with them, as some unadvised
persons would have perswaded him: For he
considered that the Enemy had a strong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in the Fleet, whereas he had none; that
their Ships were more in number, of bigger
burden, stronger, and huger built, so that
they could not be boarded but with extreme
disadvantage: He foresaw also that the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
would turn to a greater dammage
than the victory would avail him: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vanquished he should have brought
<hi>England</hi> into extreme hazzard, and being
Conquerour he should only have gained a
little glory to himself for overthrowing
the Fleet, and beating the Enemy. On this
day the sorest fight was performed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
besides other remarkable harms which
the Enemy sustained, a great <hi>Venetian</hi> Ship
with some other smaller were surprized,
and taken by the <hi>English,</hi> and the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
were forced for their further safety
to gather themselves close into a Roundel,
their best and greatest Ships standing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
that they might secure those that were
battered and less.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> the twenty fourth, the Fight was
only between the four great Galliasses,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41458:23"/>
and some of the <hi>English</hi> Ships, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
having great advantage, theirs being
rowed with Oars, and ours (by reason of
the calm) having no use of their Sails, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
which they sorely galled the
Enemy with their great and Chain shot;
wherewith they cut in sunder their tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
Cables, and Cordage, to their no little
prejudice. But wanting Powder which they
had spent so freely, and other provision to
maintain the fight, the Lord Admiral sent
some of his smaller Ships to the next Ports
of <hi>England</hi> to fetch supply; which stirred
up jealousies in the heads of many, that we
should thus want upon our own Coasts.
In which <hi>Interim</hi> a Council was called,
wherein it was resolved that the <hi>English</hi>
Fleet should be divided into four Squadrons,
and those committed to four brave Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and skilful Seamen, whereof the Lord
Admiral in the <hi>Ark Royal</hi> was chief: Sir
<hi>Francis Drake</hi> in the <hi>Revenge</hi> led the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond:
Captain <hi>Hawkins</hi> the third: and
Captain <hi>Forbusher</hi> the fourth. Other most
valiant Captains there were in others of
Her Majesties Ships; as the Lord <hi>Thomas
Howard</hi> in the <hi>Lion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> the Lord <hi>Sheffield</hi> in
the <hi>Bear,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Southwel</hi> in the <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
Captain <hi>Baker</hi> in the <hi>Victory,</hi> and
Captain <hi>George Fenner</hi> in the <hi>Gallion-Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester:</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:41458:24"/>
It was also further appointed, that
out of every Squadron certain small Vessels
should give you a charge from divers parts
in the dead time of the night, but the
calm continuing, this design could not be
effected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> the twenty fifth, being Saint <hi>James</hi>
day, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were arrived against the
Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> where was a most terrible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,
each shooting off their whole
broad sides, and not above sixscore
yards the one from the other: There the
Saint <hi>Anne,</hi> a Gallion of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which
could not hold course with the rest, was
set upon by certain small <hi>English</hi> Vessels, to
whose rescue came <hi>Leva</hi> and <hi>Don Diego
Telles Enriques</hi> with three Galliasses: which
the Lord Admiral himself and the Lord
<hi>Thomas Howard</hi> in the <hi>Golden Lion,</hi> row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Ships with their Boats (so great
was the calm) charged in such sort with
their roaring Canons, that they had much
ado, and that not without loss, to save the
Gallion, from which time forward none
of the Galliasses would undertake the fight.
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> reported that the <hi>English</hi> the
same day beat the <hi>Spanish</hi> Admiral in the
utter Squadron, rending her sore with their
Great Ordnance, and having slain many of
her men, shot down her main Mast, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41458:24"/>
would have much endanger'd her, but that
<hi>Mexia</hi> and <hi>Rechalde</hi> came in good time
to her rescue. That the <hi>Spanish</hi> Admiral,
assisted by <hi>Rechalde</hi> and others, set upon
the <hi>English</hi> Admiral, which happily escaped
by the sudden turning of the wind. That
thereupon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> gave over the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit,
and holding on their Course, dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
again a Messenger to the Prince of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
to joyn his Fleet with all speed to the
Kings <hi>Armado,</hi> and withal to send them a
supply of great shot. But these things
were unknown to the <hi>English,</hi> who wrote
that from one of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships they had
shot down their Lanthorn, and from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Beak-head, and that they had done
much hurt to the third; that the <hi>Non-par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rella</hi>
and the <hi>Mary Rose,</hi> had fought a while
with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and that other Ships had
rescued the <hi>Triumph,</hi> which was in danger:
The truth is, they had so sorely battered
those huge wooden Castles, that once more
they forced them for their further safety to
gather themselves into a Roundel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> the twenty sixth, the Lord Admiral,
to encourage and reward the Noble At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of his gallant Captains, bestowed
the Order of Knighthood upon the Lords
<hi>Howard</hi> and <hi>Sheffield, Roger Townsend,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41458:25"/>
John Hawkings, Martin Forbusher,</hi> and
others: And yet the vain glorious and boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Spaniards</hi> caused a report to be spread
in <hi>France,</hi> that <hi>England</hi> was wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
by them. It was resolved by our
men that from thenceforth they should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sail
the Enemy no more till they came to
the <hi>British Frith,</hi> or strait of <hi>Callis,</hi> where
the Lord <hi>Henry Seimore</hi> and Sir <hi>William
Winter,</hi> with the Ships which they had for
the guard of the narrow Seas, waited their
coming; and so with a fair gale from the
South-West and by South, the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Fleet sailed forward, the <hi>English</hi> Fleet fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
it close at the heels. And so far was
it from terrifying our <hi>English</hi> Coasts with
the name of <hi>Invincible;</hi> or with its huge
and terrible spectacle, that our brave <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
youth with an incredible alacrity, leave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Parents, Wives, Children, Kinsfolk, and
Friends, out of their entire love to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country, hired Ships from all parts at
their own proper charges, and joyned
with the Fleet in great numbers, amongst
whom were the Earl of <hi>Oxford, Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi>
and <hi>Cumberland: Thomas</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Cecil: Henry Brook: Charles Blunt:
Walter Raleigh: William Hatton: Robert
Carey: Ambrose Willoughby: Thomas Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41458:25"/>
Arthur Gorges,</hi> and many others of
great note.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> the twenty seventh, the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Fleet making forward, towards Evening,
came over against <hi>Dover,</hi> and Anchored
before <hi>Callis,</hi> intending for <hi>Dunkirk</hi> there
to joyn with the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Forces,
wel perceiving that without their assistance
they could do nothing: They were also
warned by the Pilots, that if they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any farther it was to be feared lest they
should be driven by the force of the Tide
into the Northern Ocean. The <hi>English</hi>
Fleet following up hard upon them, cast
Anchor so near that they lay within Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
shot; at which time the Lord <hi>Henry
Seimore,</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> joyned their Ships to
them, so that now the <hi>English</hi> Fleet consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of one hundred and forty Sail, all able
Ships to fight, Sail, and turn about which
way soever they pleased. Yet were they
not above fifteen that sustained the greatest
burden of the fight. From hence once more
the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> sent to the Prince of
<hi>Parma</hi> to hasten forth his long expected,
and much desired Forces: with which Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
many of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Noblemen
went to Land; having had enough of the
Sea; amongst whom was the Prince of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41458:26"/>
                     <hi>Ascoli,</hi> the Kings base Son, who returned
to his Ship no more; and indeed well it
was for him, for that his Gallion was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
cast away upon the <hi>Irish</hi> Coast,
and never returned to salute <hi>Spain.</hi> These
Messengers earnestly prayed the Prince of
<hi>Parma</hi> to put forth to Sea with his Army,
which the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet should protect, as
it were under her wings, till it was landed
in <hi>England.</hi> And indeed the Prince of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
hearing the best, and not the worst of
this Voyage, made all things ready that lay
in his charge, whose hopes were so fixed
upon <hi>Englands</hi> Conquest, and the glittering
Diadem upon Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> head did
so dazel his ambitious Eyes, being assured
by Cardinal <hi>Allen</hi> that he was the man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to be Crowned therewith, that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
the Coronet of the <hi>Low-Country</hi>
Government, he transferred the charge
thereof upon Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> the Elder,
and having made his vows to the Lady of
<hi>Hall</hi> in <hi>Heinault,</hi> he was already in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
no less than a King. But the date of
his Reign was soon expired, and his swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
tide fallen into a low shallow ebb: For
the day following in his march to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi>
he heard the thundring Ordnance ringing
the passing Peal of his hopes and title, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41458:26"/>
the same Evening had news of the hard suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the hoped advancers
of his dreamed felicity; and indeed do
what he could, he could not be ready at the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> call: His flat-bottomed Boats for
the shallow Channels leaked; his provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Victuals proved unready, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
(having hitherto been detained
against their wills) had withdrawn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
there lay also watching before the
Havens of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> and <hi>Newport,</hi> whence
he was to put forth to Sea, the men of War
of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zelanders,</hi> so well
provided with great Ordnance and Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
that he could not put from the shore
unless he would wilfully cast himself and
his men upon eminent perils and dangers
of destruction: and yet he being a skilful
and experienced Commander, omitted no
means, being inflamed with a desire to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
<hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> foresight pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
both his diligence and the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
hope of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> For by Her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the next day after the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had
cast Anchor, the Lord Admiral made
ready eight of his worst Ships, filled with
wild-fire, pitch, rosin, brimstone, and other
combustible matter: their Ordnance were
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41458:27"/>
charged with Bullets, Stones, Chains, and
such like things, fit instruments of death;
and all the men being taken out, upon the
Sabbath day, <hi>July,</hi> the twenty eighth, at
two of the clock after midnight, were they
let drive with Wind and Tide, under the
guidance of <hi>Young</hi> and <hi>Prowse,</hi> amongst
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet. And so the Pilots re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning,
and their trains taking fire, such
a sudden thunderclap was given by them,
that the affrighted <hi>Spaniards,</hi> it being the
dead time of the night, were amazed, and
stricken with an horrible fear, lest all their
Ships should have been fired by them. And
to avoid this present mischief, being in
great perplexity, they had no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to avoid these deadly Engines, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
inventions, than by cutting their
Cables in sunder, the time being too short
to weigh up their Anchors, and so hoising
up their Sails to drive at random into the
Seas: in which hast and confusion the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of their Galliasses fell foul upon another
Ship, and lost her Rudder: and so floted up
and down, and the next day fearfully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
towards <hi>Callis,</hi> ran aground upon the
sands, where she was set upon by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</hi>
This Galliass was of <hi>Naples:</hi> Her
General was <hi>Heugh de Moncado,</hi> who
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41458:27"/>
fought the more valiantly, because he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
present help from the Prince of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma:</hi>
But Sir <hi>Amias Preston</hi> gave such a
fierce assault upon her, that <hi>Moncado</hi> was
shot dead with a Bullet, and the Galliass
boarded, wherein many of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
were slain, and a great many others leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the Sea were drowned, only Don
<hi>Antonio de Matiques,</hi> a principal Officer,
had the good hap to escape, and was the
first man that carried the unwelcome news
into <hi>Spain,</hi> that their <hi>Invincible Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi>
proved vincible. This huge bottom
manned with four hundred Souldiers, and
three hundred Slaves, that had in her fifty
thousand Ducats of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Kings trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
fell into the <hi>English</hi> mens hands; a
reward well befitting their valour, who
sharing it merrily amongst them, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the miserable Slaves from their Fetters,
would have fired the empty Vessel: but
Monsieur <hi>Gourden,</hi> Governour of <hi>Callis,</hi>
fearing that the fire might endanger the
Town, would not permit them to do it,
bending his Ordnance against those which
attempted it.</p>
                  <p>Had not this politick Stratagem of the
Fire-ships been found out, it would have
been very difficult for the <hi>English</hi> to have
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41458:28"/>
dislodged them; for those huge Ships had
their bulks so strengthened with thick
Planks, and massie Beams, that our Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
might strike, and stick, and yet never
pass through them: So that the greatest
hurt which our <hi>English</hi> Canon did, was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by rending their Masts and Tacklings.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> report that the Duke of
<hi>Medina,</hi> when these burning Ships approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
commanded the whole Fleet to weigh
Anchor to avoid them, yet so, as having
shunned the danger, presently every Ship
to return to her former station, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
he did himself, giving a signal to
the rest to do the like, by discharging one
of his great Guns; but in this general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation
the warning was heard but of a
few, the rest being scattered all about,
which for fear were driven some into the
wide Ocean, and other upon the shallows of
<hi>Flanders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> the twenty ninth, after this miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
disaster, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ranging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the best order they could, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
over against <hi>Graveling,</hi> where
once again the <hi>English</hi> getting the wind of
them, deprived them of the conveniency
of <hi>Callis</hi> road, and kept them from supply
out of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> from whence rested their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41458:28"/>
full hope of support. In the mean while
<hi>Drake</hi> and <hi>Fenner</hi> played incessantly with
their great Ordnance upon the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Fleet, and with them presently joined
<hi>Fenton, Southwel, Beeston, Cross, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
and lastly the Lord Admiral him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
with the Lords, <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> and
<hi>Sheffield:</hi> On the other hand, the Duke
of <hi>Medina, Leva, Oquenda, Richalde,</hi>
and others of them, with much ado got
clear off the shallows, and sustained the
charge as well as they could, yet were most
of their Ships pittifully torn and shot
through, the fight continuing from morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
till night, which indeed proved very
dismal to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> for therein a
great Gallion of <hi>Biscay</hi> perished, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
whereof to avoid ignominy, or to
be reputed valorous, desperately slew each
other. In which distress also two other
great Ships presently sunk. The Gallion
Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> under the command of Don
<hi>Diego Piementelli,</hi> coming to rescue Don
<hi>Francisco de Toledo,</hi> who was in the Saint
<hi>Philip,</hi> was, together with the other,
miserably torn with shot, their tacklings
spent, and their bulks rent, so that the
water entred in on all sides, which fight was
maintained against them by <hi>Seimore</hi> and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41458:29"/>
                     <hi>Winter;</hi> In which distress they were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
near <hi>Ostend,</hi> where again they were
shot through and through by the <hi>Zelan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:</hi>
Their desperate condition being
known, the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> sent his own
Skiff for Don <hi>Diego Piementelli,</hi> Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master,
and Colonel over thirty two Bands:
But he in a <hi>Spanish</hi> Bravado refused to leave
his Ship, and like a Souldier assayed every
way to free himself: But being unable to
do it, he forthwith made towards the Coast
of <hi>Flanders,</hi> where being again set upon
by five <hi>Dutchmen</hi> of War, was required
to yield, which finally he did unto Captain
<hi>Peter Banderduess,</hi> who carried him into
<hi>Zeland:</hi> aud for a Trophy of his Victory
hung up his Banner in the Church of <hi>Leiden,</hi>
whose length reached from the very roof
to the ground: Another also of the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Ships coasting for <hi>Flanders,</hi> was cast away
upon the sands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Francisco de Toledo</hi> also, being likewise a
Colonel over thirty two Bands in the other
Gallion, taking his course for the Coast of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> his Ship proved so leak, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with some others of the chief betook
themselves to their Skiff, and arrived at
<hi>Ostend,</hi> the Ship with the residue being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the <hi>Flushingers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:41458:29"/>
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> now finding their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
into <hi>England</hi> far worse than they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
were content to couch their Fleet
as close together as they could, not seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to offend their Enemies, but only to
defend themselves, and the wind coming
to the South-west, in the same order they
passed by <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> still fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
them at the heels. But lest the
Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> should take this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to put forth to Sea, the Lord Admiral
dispatched the Lord <hi>Henry Seimore</hi> with
his Squadron of small Ships to the Coast of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> to join with those <hi>Hollanders,</hi>
which there kept watch under <hi>Justin</hi> of
<hi>Nassau,</hi> their Admiral: This <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet
consisted of thirty five Ships, furnished with
most skilful Mariners, and twelve hundred
Musqueteers, old experienced Souldiers,
whom the States had culled out of several
Garisons: Their charge was to stop up the
<hi>Flemish</hi> Havens, and to prevent entercourse
with <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> whither the Prince of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
was come, and would fain have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
forth, though his men were unwilling,
hearing how their Friends had been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
at Sea: Only the <hi>English</hi> Fugitives,
being about seven hundred in number, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that treacherous Knight, Sir <hi>William
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41458:30"/>
Stanley<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> were very forward to be the first
that should assault <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> the 31. betimes in the morning the
North-west-wind blew hard, and the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Fleet laboured by that advantage to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the narrow strait, but were driven
towards <hi>Zeland:</hi> whereupon the <hi>English</hi>
gave off the Chase, because they saw them
carried almost of their utter ruine; for they
could not but run aground upon the sands
and shallows near <hi>Zeland:</hi> but the wind
turning presently into the South-west and
by West, they sailed before the wind, by
which means they were cleared of the shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
and so that Evening they called a
Council what to do, and by consent it was
resolved to return into <hi>Spain</hi> by the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theru
Ocean: for that they wanted many
necessaries, especially great shot; their Ships
also were pittifully torn, and there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no hope that the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> would
or could bring forth his Fleet.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Armado</hi> having now gotten more
Sea-room for their huge-bodied bulks,
spread their Main Sails, and made away
as fast as wind and water would give them
leave: More fearing the small Fleet and
Forces of the <hi>English</hi> (though far inferiour
to them) than standing upon terms of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41458:30"/>
either for the credit of their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
or their <hi>Invincible Navy:</hi> But surely
if they had known the want of Powder
ours sustained (a fault inexcusable upon
our own Coasts) they no doubt would have
stood better to their tacklings: But God in
this, as in all the rest, infatuated them, and
would have us to acknowledge that our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
was by his own gracious Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and power, and not by any strength
or policy of our own.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet being now carried
forth into the deep, they directed their
course Northward, and our <hi>English</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
followed them, lest they should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to put into <hi>Scotland,</hi> against whom
they now and then turned head, but stood
not to it: Yet most men thought they
would return, whereupon our Queen with
a manly courage took a view of her Army
and Camp at <hi>Tilbury,</hi> and walking through
the ranks of Armed men placed on both
sides, with a Leaders Truncheon in her
hand, sometimes in a Martial pace, and
other sometimes like a Woman, incredible
it is how much she strengthened and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged
the hearts both of her Captains and
Souldiers with her speech and presence. But
contrary to expectation, the Enemies with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41458:31"/>
their Sails spread, betook themselves to
an absolute flight, and leaving <hi>Scotland</hi>
on the West, they bended their Course
towards <hi>Norway,</hi> being ill advised therein,
(but their necessity urged, and God had
infatuated their Counsels) thus to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to put their shaken and battered bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
into those black and dangerous Seas:
Neither was the Climate healthful for the
crazed Bodies of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaten,
and tired with wants, they being
now entred the fifty seventh degree of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
Latitude; from whence our Lord
Admiral returned, leaving only some Scouts
to discover their success.</p>
                  <p>When the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> came to
<hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> entertained him
with opprobrious speeches, as if in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> he had neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his opportunity, and willingly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
so hopeful a Design. The Prince
to give them some satisfaction punished his
Purveyors of Victuals, yet withal laughing
in his sleeve at the insolency of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
having heard them formerly to make
their boasts that whithersoever they went
they carried assured Victory along with
them, and that the <hi>English</hi> durst not once
abide to look them in the face.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:41458:31"/>
The <hi>Spaniards</hi> (as was said even now)
being freed from the <hi>English</hi> that had
haunted them like their Ghosts, consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
most seriously what was next to be
done: they were very tender of the Popes
Credit, who had prophesied, that this
attempt would be fortunate and successful:
The wrath of King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> was to be
feared, his vast Expences being thus lost, and
his hopes frustrated: other Adventurers
would be undone: the glory of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
would be laid in the dust: the <hi>Invincible
Navy</hi> become a scorn, and <hi>England</hi> would
still be <hi>England,</hi> not lorded over by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
if without further attempt they
should return into <hi>Spain.</hi> But on the other
hand they considered that five thousand of
the Souldiers were slain: a multitude of
their Survivors lay sick or maimed upon
their hands: Twelve of their greatest Ships
were sunk, lost, or taken: their Cables,
Masts, and Sails were cut, rent and broken
with the <hi>English</hi> shot: Their Anchors left
in the road of <hi>Callis:</hi> their Victuals fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Their fresh water was spent: and
their Enemies no less fierce, undaunted,
and successful than at the first: The Prince
of <hi>Parma</hi> though long in preparing, yet
still unready, and kept in by the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:41458:32"/>
Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> firm Allies: which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
wisely ballanced, the vote went
currant for their hastning to <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But withal knowing that the King of
<hi>Scots</hi> (fast knit in affection and blood to
our Queen) would yield them no sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies;
and having as little hope that <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>
would afford them any, they cast all
their Horses, and Mules overboard, for
the sparing of their fresh water: and so
framing their course to sail about <hi>Cathenes,</hi>
and the Coasts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> they steered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Orcades</hi> and the Isles of <hi>Farr</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the sixty first degree of Latitude: From
whence the Duke of <hi>Medina,</hi> with his
best stored Ships, took Westward over
the main Ocean towards <hi>Biscay,</hi> and at
last arrived safely in <hi>Spain:</hi> where for his
welcome, he was deposed from all his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
forbidden to come at Court,
and commanded to live private, neither
could he give satisfaction by his bad excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
albeit he imputed it to the treachery
of his Mariners; to their ignorance, and
small experience of those Northern Seas;
the want of succours from the Prince of
<hi>Parma;</hi> the Tempests, Shipwracks and
ill fortune: but not a word of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, upon that Giantlike under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41458:32"/>
to enslave all <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>Spanish</hi>
yoke.</p>
                  <p>The residue of the Ships, being about
forty in number, fell nearer with the Coast
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> intending to touch at Cape
<hi>Clare,</hi> well hoping there to refresh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and supply their wants: but the
winds proving contrary and tempestuous
upon those dangerous Seas, many of their
Ships perished upon the <hi>Irish</hi> shores, and
amongst others a great Galliass, wherein
<hi>Michael de Oquendo</hi> was Commander,
and two other <hi>Venetian</hi> Ships of great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
besides thirty eight more, with most
of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> contained in them. Such
as got clear off the danger, put forth to Sea:
some of which by a strong West Wind
were driven into the <hi>English</hi> Channel,
where some of them were again set upon
and taken by the <hi>English,</hi> others by men of
<hi>Rochel</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and some arrived at
<hi>New Haven</hi> in <hi>Normandy:</hi> So that of one
hundred thirty four Ships that set Sail out of
<hi>Lisbon,</hi> only fifty three returned into <hi>Spain:</hi>
Of the four Galliasses of <hi>Naples</hi> but one:
of the four Gallions of <hi>Portugal,</hi> but one:
of the ninety one <hi>Callions,</hi> and great Hulks
from divers Provinces, only thirty three
returned, fifty eight being lost. In brief,
they lost in this Voyage eighty one Vessels,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41458:33"/>
thirteen thousand, five hundred and odd
Souldiers. Prisoners taken in <hi>England,
Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> were above
two thousand: Amongst those in <hi>England,</hi>
Don <hi>Pedro de Valdez,</hi> Don <hi>Vasques de Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi>
and Don <hi>Alonzo de Saies,</hi> and others
were kept for their ransome. In <hi>Ireland</hi>
Don <hi>Alonzo de Luzon, Roderigo de Lasse,</hi>
and others of great account: In <hi>Zeland</hi>
was Don <hi>Diego Piementelli:</hi> To be brief,
there was no famous, or noble family in all
<hi>Spain,</hi> which in this expedition lost not a
Son, Brother, or Kinsman. And thus this
<hi>Armado</hi> which had been so many years in
preparing, and rigging with such vast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
was in one month many times as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted,
and at length wholly defeated with
the slaughter of so many of her men, not
one hundred of the <hi>English</hi> being lacking,
nor one small Ship of theirs taken, or lost,
save only that of <hi>Cocks:</hi> and having tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
round about all <hi>Britain,</hi> by <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the <hi>Orcades</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> most grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously
tossed, and very much distressed, and
wasted by stormes, wracks, and all kinds
of misery, at length came lamely home,
with perpetual dishonour: whereupon <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi>
were stamped in memory thereof: A
Fleet flying with full Sailes; with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
<hi>Venit, vidit, fugit,</hi> It came, it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41458:33"/>
saw, it fled: Others in honour of our
Queen, with flaming Ships, and a Fleet in
a great confusion, and this Motto, <hi>Dux foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina
facti,</hi> A Woman was Conductor of
the fact.</p>
                  <p>In the aforementioned wracks above se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
hundred Souldiers and Sailors were cast
on land in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who (upon the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> to the King
of <hi>Scots,</hi> and by the permission of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth)</hi> were after a years time sent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
into the <hi>Low-Countries:</hi> But more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully
were those miserable wretches
dealt withal, whose hap was to be driven
by tempest into <hi>Ireland:</hi> Some of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
slain by the wild <hi>Irish</hi> (their old friends)
and others of them being put to death by
the command of the Lord Deputy: For he
fearing lest they might join with the <hi>Irish</hi>
to disturb the peace of the Nation, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Bingham,</hi> Governour of <hi>Connaught</hi> to
destroy them: but he refusing to deal so
rigorously with those that had yielded
themselves, He sent <hi>Fowle,</hi> Deputy-Marshal,
who drew them out of their lurking holes,
and cut off the heads of above two hundred
of them; which fact the Queen from her
heart condemned, and abhorred as a fact
of too great cruelty. The remainder of
them being terrified herewith, sick and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41458:34"/>
starven as they were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> committed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to Sea in their shattered Vessels, and
were many of them swallowed up by the
Waves.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> charged the whole fault
of their overthrow upon the Prince of
<hi>Parma,</hi> as if in favour to our Queen he had
wilfully and artificially delayed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them: But this was but an inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and pretention given out by them,
partly upon a <hi>Spanish</hi> Envy against that
Prince, he being an <hi>Italian,</hi> and his Son a
Competitor to the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal:</hi>
But chiefly to save the scorn and monstrous
disreputation which they and their Nation
received by the success of that enterprise:
Therefore their colours, and excuses (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth):
were, That their General by Sea
had a limited Commission, not to fight till
the Land Forces were come in to them, and
that the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> had particular
reaches and ends of his own to cross the
designe.</p>
                  <p>But it was both a strange Commission,
and a strange Obedience to a Commission,
for men in the midst of their own blood,
and being so furiously assailed, to hold
their hands, contrary to the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and necessity. And as for the Prince
of <hi>Parma,</hi> he was reasonably well tempted
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41458:34"/>
to be true to that enterprise, by no less
promise than to be made a Feudatory or
Beneficiary King of <hi>England</hi> under the
Seignory (in chief) of the Pope, and the
protection of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Besides,
it appeared that the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> held
his place long after of the Government of
the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> in the favour and trust of
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and by the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
and services that he performed
in <hi>France.</hi> It is also manifest that this
Prince did his best to come down, and put
to Sea: The truth was, that the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Navy, upon those proofs of Fight which
they had with the <hi>English,</hi> finding how
much hurt they received, and how little
hurt they did, by reason of the activity
and low building of our Ships, and skill of
Seamen; and being also commanded by a
General of small courage and experience,
and having lost at first two of their bravest
Commanders at Sea, <hi>Pedro de Valdez,</hi> and
<hi>Michael de Oquendo,</hi> durst not put it to
a Battel at Sea, but set up their rest
wholly upon the Land enterprise. On
the other side, the transportation of the
Land Forces failed in the very foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
For, whereas the Council of <hi>Spain</hi>
made full account that their Navy should
be Master of the Sea, and therefore able
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41458:35"/>
to guard and protect the Vessels of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation:
When it fell out to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that the great Navy was distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and had enough to do to save it
self, and that their Land Forces were
impounded by the <hi>Hollanders:</hi> Things
(I say) being in this state, it came to
pass that the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> must
have flown, if he would have come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>England,</hi> for he could get neither Bark,
nor Mariner to put to Sea. Yet certain it is
that the Prince looked for the coming
back of the <hi>Armado</hi> even at that time
when they were wandring, and making
their perambulation upon the Northern
Seas.</p>
                  <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> lying one night in her
Army at <hi>Tilbury,</hi> the old Lord Treasurer
<hi>Burleigh</hi> came thither and delivered to the
Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> the Examination of Don
<hi>Pedro,</hi> who was taken and brought into
<hi>England</hi> by Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> which exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
the Earl delivered unto me (saith
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Sharp,</hi> mine Author) that I might pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
it to the Army in my next Sermon. The
sum of it was this:</p>
                  <p>Don <hi>Pedro</hi> being asked by some of the
Lords of the Privy Council, what was the
intent of their coming? stoutly answered
the Lords, what? but to subdue your Nation,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41458:35"/>
and to root it out. Good (said the Lords)
what then meant you to do with the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks?</hi>
we meant (said he) to have sent
them (good men) directly to Heaven, as
all you that are Hereticks to Hell. Yea, but
(said the Lords) what meant you to do
with your whips of Cord and Wier, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
you have such great store in your Ships?
what? (said he) we meant to whip you
Hereticks to Death that have assisted my
Masters Rebels, and done such dishonour
to our <hi>Catholick</hi> King and People. Yea, but
what would you have done (said they) with
their young Children? They (said he)
which were above seven years old should
have gone the same way that their Fathers
went: the rest should have lived, only we
would have branded them in the Foreheads
with the letter L. for <hi>Lutheran,</hi> and reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them for perpetual bondage.</p>
                  <p>This I take God to witness (saith my
Author) I received of those great Lords,
as upon examination taken by the Council,
and by Commandment, published it to the
Army.</p>
                  <p>The next day (saith he) the Queen rode
through her Army, attended by Noble-Footmen,
<hi>Leicester, Essex,</hi> and <hi>Norris</hi> then
Lord Marshall, and divers other great
Lords, where she made an Excellent Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41458:36"/>
to her Army, and withal commanded
a publick Fast to be kept. Her Oration
was this.</p>
                  <p>MY loving people, we have been perswaded
by some that are careful of our safety,
to take heed how we commit our selves to armed
multitudes for fear of treachery: but I assure
you I do not desire to live to distrust my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and loving people. Let Tyrants fear: I
have alwaies so behaved my self that (under
God) I have alwaies placed my chiefest strength
and safeguard in the loyal hearts and good will
of my Subjects: and therefore I am come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
you, as you see, at this time, not for my
recreation and disport, but being resolved in
the middest and heat of the battel to live or die
amongst you all; to lay down for my God, and
for my Kingdom, and for my people, my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and my Blood even in the dust. I know I
have the body but of a weak and feeble Woman,
but I have the Heart and Stomach of a King,
and of a King of <hi>England</hi> too, and think foul
scorn that <hi>Parma,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or any Prince of
<hi>Europe</hi> should dare to invade the Borders of
my Realm; to which, rather than any disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
shall grow by me, I my self will take up
Arms, I my self will be your General, Judge,
and Rewarder of every one of your vertues in
the Field. I know that already for your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41458:36"/>
you have deserved Rewards, and
Crowns, and we do assure you in the word of a
Prince, that shall be duly paid you. In the
mean time my Lieutenant General <hi>(Leicester)</hi>
shall be in my stead, than whom, never Prince
commanded a more Noble or Worthy Subject;
not doubting but by your Obedience to my Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
by your Concord in the Camp, and your va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
in the Field, we shall shortly have a famous
Victory over those Enemies of my God, of my
Kingdoms, and my people.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see the curse of God and his
threatning in Scripture accomplished:
<hi>They came out against us one way, and they
fled seven wayes before us:</hi> making good
(even to the astonishment of all Posterity)
the wonderful Judgments of God poured
out commonly upon such vast and proud
aspirings.</p>
                  <p>After this Glorious Deliverance of
our Land by the Power of the <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent,</hi>
and the wild Boar repelled that
sought to lay waste <hi>Englands</hi> fair and
fruitful Vineyard, our Gracious and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Queen (who ever held Ingratitude a
Capital Sin, especially towards Her <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Protector)</hi> as she had begun with
Prayer, so she ended with Praise, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
solemn <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
to the Lord of Hosts at the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41458:37"/>
Church of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in her chief
City of <hi>London,</hi> which accordingly was
done upon Sabbath day the eighth of
<hi>September:</hi> at which time eleven of the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Ensignes (the once badges of
their bravery, but now of their vanity and
ignominy) were hung upon the lower
Battlements of that Church, as Palmes of
Praise for <hi>Englands</hi> Deliverance: a shew
no doubt more pleasing to God than
when their spread colours did set out the
pride of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> threatning the
blood of so many innocent and faithful
Christians.</p>
                  <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her self, to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
unto others upon Sabbath the
twenty fourth of <hi>September,</hi> came from
her Palace of <hi>White-Hall</hi> in <hi>Westminster,</hi>
through the streets of <hi>London</hi> (which
were hung with blew Cloth, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of the City standing in their Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
on both sides with their Banners in
goodly order) being carried in a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
drawn with two Horses to St. <hi>Pauls</hi>
Church, where dismounting from Her
Chariot at the West door, she humbled
Her self upon her Knees, and with great
devotion, in an audible voice She praised
God as her only <hi>Defender,</hi> who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
Her Self and People from the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41458:37"/>
bloody designes of so cruel an Enemy.
The Sermon then preached tended wholly
to give all the glory to God, as the
Author of this wonderful deliverance:
and when that was ended, Her Majesty
Her self, with most Princely and Christian
Speeches exhorted all the people to a due
performance of those religious services of
thankfulness which the Lord expected and
required of them.</p>
                  <p>About the same time the Fair being
kept in <hi>Southwark,</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Flags were
hung up at <hi>London-Bridge</hi> to the great joy
of the beholders, and eternal infamy of the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> proud attempts, as irreligious
as unsuccessful. But the solemn day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for Thanksgiving throughout the
Land was the nineteenth of <hi>November,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Tuesday,</hi> which accordingly was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
with great joy and praising of God;
and well it were if it had so continued still,
being no less a Deliverance than was that
of <hi>Purim</hi> amongst the Jews, which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
to be kept holy throughout their
Generations.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Zelanders</hi> also to leave a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
of their thankfulness to God, and their
faithfulness to our Queen, caused <hi>Medals</hi>
of Silver to be stamped, having engraven
on the one side the Armes of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41458:38"/>
with this Inscription, <hi>Glory to God
alone,</hi> and on the reverse, the Portraicture
of great Ships, under written, <hi>the Spanish
Fleet,</hi> and in the Circumference, <hi>It came,
It went, It was, Anno</hi> 1588. In other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
also were stamped Ships floating, and
sinking, and in the reverse, Supplicants upon
their Knees, with this Motto, <hi>Man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth,
God disposeth,</hi> 1588. The <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
also stamped some Medals with <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Ships and this Motto, <hi>Impius fugit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
sequente:</hi> the wicked fly when none
pursues.</p>
                  <p>Our Queen, to shew Her Gratitude as
well to the Instruments as to the Author
of this great Deliverance, assigned cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
yearly Rents to the Lord Admiral
for his gallant service, and many times
commended him, and the other Captains
of Her Ships, as men born for the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Country. The rest She gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
saluted by name as oft as she saw
them, as men of notable deserts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they held themselves well apaid, and
those which were Wounded, Maimed, or
Poor, She rewarded with competent Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
                  <p>The Lord of Hosts having thus dispel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
this Storm, the Queen dissolved Her
Camp at <hi>Tilbury,</hi> and not long after the

Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> ended his dayes, having
been a Peer of great Estate and Honour,
but liable to the common destiny of <hi>Great
Ones,</hi> whom all men magnifie in their life
time, but few speak well of after their
Death.</p>
                  <p>This Admirable Deliverance was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated
by almost all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
especially by all the reformed
Churches, and many Learned Men ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
the same in Verse, amongst
which I shall onely mention two: The

                  <p>LEt the remembrance of so sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
a mercy and deliverance
vouchsafed by God both to
Church and State should be buried in
Oblivion, I have (at the request of the
Book seller) presented thee here with a
true and faithful Narrative of that
grand work of darkness, forged in
Hell, and by Satan suggested to some
<hi>Popish</hi> Instruments, who envying the
peace and prosperity of our Church, and
progress of the Gospel, had designed at
one blow to overthrow both: and that
nothing might be wanting to complete
that horried wickedness, their purpose
was to have charged it upon the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi>
thereby hoping to free themselves
and their Religion from the imputation
of so hainous a Crime. Now that the
<pb facs="tcp:41458:42"/>
memorial of a mercy of such publick
and general concernment should not be
forgotten, we have the word of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
God to be our guide therein. When
the Lord had by his Angel destroyed
the first-born of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and spared
<hi>Israel,</hi> he instituted the feast of the
<hi>Passover</hi> to continue the memorial
thereof through their Generations, <hi>Ex.
12.</hi> 11, 12, 14. and ver. 26, 27.
saith <hi>Moses</hi> to them, <hi>when your
Children shall say unto you, What
mean you by this service? ye shall
say, It is the Sacrifice of the Lords
Passover, who passed over the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the Children of Israel when
he smote the Egyptians, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
our Houses.</hi> And how careful
good <hi>Mordecai</hi> was to continue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of that great deliverance
of the people of God from destruction
plotted and contrived by that wicked
<hi>Haman,</hi> appears <hi>Esth.</hi> 9. 20, &amp;c.
where they did not only celebrate those
present dayes of their deliverance with
feasting, and gladness: but he, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:41458:42"/>
with the rest of the Jewes, or
dained, and <hi>took upon them, and
their seed, and upon all such as join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves unto them, so as it
should not fail, that they would keep
those daies in their appointed time
every year, and that those daies
should be remembred, and kept
through their Generations, every
Family, every Province, and every
City, and that those daies of <hi>Purim</hi>
should not fail from amongst the
Jews, nor the memorial of them
perish from their seed,</hi> &amp;c. And
truly the remembrance of this great
mercy hath the more need to be revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at this time, when some noted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
amongst us begin to decry it, and
wholly to lay aside the observation of
that day, though enjoined by Act of
Parliament, and made conscience of
by most of the godly people of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I have also been induced the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to make this brief Collection of
the Story, because, though it be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
by others, yet it is in larger Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes,
<pb facs="tcp:41458:43"/>
which are not every ones mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
whereas, for a small matter eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
family may get and keep this by
them for the benefit, and satisfaction
both of themselves and Children, that
so the Lord may not lose of his glory,
nor they (for want of information)
fail of their duty. I shall conclude with
that of the Psalmist, <hi>Psal. 107. 8.
O that men would praise the Lord
for his goodness: and for his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
works to the Children of men!</hi>

                  <head>THE
DELIVERANCE
OF OUR
CHURCH and STATE
FROM THE
Hellish Powder-Plot,
1605.</head>
                  <p>THE Plot was to undermine the
Parliament-House, and with Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to blow up the King, Prince,
Clergy, Nobles, Knights, and Burgesses,
the very confluence of all the flower of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Piety, Learning, Prudence and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the Land: Fathers, Sons, Brothers,
Allies, Friends, Foes, Papists, and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
all at one blast.</p>
                  <p>Their intent, when that irreligious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement
had been performed, was, to
surprize the remainder of the Kings Issue,
to alter Religion and Government, and to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41458:44"/>
bring in a Foreign Power. Sir <hi>Edmond
Baynam,</hi> an attainted person (who stiled
himself <hi>Prince of the damned Crew)</hi> was
sent unto the Pope as he was a temporal
Prince to acquaint him with the Gun-Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Plot;
and now to the Plot in self.</p>
                  <p>The Sessions of Parliament being dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>July</hi> the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1604. and
Prorogued to the seventh of <hi>February</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:
<hi>Catesby</hi> being at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> sent for
<hi>Thomas Winter,</hi> who before had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
into <hi>Spain,</hi> and acquainted him with
the design of blowing up the Parliament-House,
who readily apprehending it, said,
<hi>This indeed strikes at the root;</hi> only these
helps were wanting; a House for residence,
and a skilful man to carry on the Mine:
But the first, <hi>Catesby</hi> assured him was easie
to be got; and for the man, he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Guy Fawkes,</hi> a sufficient Souldier, and
a forward Catholick: Thus <hi>Robert Catesby,
John Wright, Thomas Winter,</hi> and <hi>Guy
Fawkes,</hi> had many meetings, and Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
about this business, till at last <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Percy</hi> came puffing in to <hi>Catesby's</hi>
Lodging at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> saying, <hi>What Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
shall we alwaies be talking, and never do
any thing? You cannot be ignorant how things
proceed?</hi> To whom <hi>Catesby</hi> answered, that
something was resolved on, but first an
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41458:44"/>
Oath for secresie was to be administred:
for which purpose they appointed to meet
some three days after, behind <hi>Clements</hi>
Church beyond <hi>Temple-Bar;</hi> where being
met, <hi>Percy</hi> professed that for the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
cause, himself would be the man to
advance it, were it with the slaughter of
the King, which he was there ready to
undertake and do.</p>
                  <p>No <hi>Tom</hi> (said <hi>Catesby)</hi> thou shalt not
adventure thy self to so small a purpose; if
thou wilt be a Traytor, there is a Plot to
greater advantage, and such an one as can
never be discovered: Hereupon all of them
took the Oath of Secresie, heard a Mass,
and received the Sacrament, after which
<hi>Catesby</hi> told them his devilish device by
Mine and Gunpowder to blow up the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-House,
and so by one stroke with
the destruction of many to effect that at
once which had been many years attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
and for cause of Conscience to kill
the innocent with the nocent, he told them
that it was warrantable by the Authority
of <hi>Garnet</hi> himself, the superiour of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Jesuites, and of <hi>Garrard</hi> and <hi>Tresmond</hi>
(Jesuitical Priests likewise) who by their
Apostolical Power did commend the fact,
and absolve the Actors. The Oath was given
them by the said <hi>Garrard</hi> in these words;</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:41458:45"/>
You shall swear by the blessed Trinity, and
by the Sacrament you now purpose to receive,
never to disclose directly, nor indirectly, by
word, or circumstance, the matter that shall
be proposed to you to keep secret, nor desist from
the execution thereof until the rest shall give
you leave.</p>
                  <p>The Project being thus far carried on,
in the next place the first thing they sought
after, was an House wherein they might
begin their work, for which purpose no
place was held fitter than a certain Edifice
adjoining to the Wall of the Parliament
House, which served for a withdrawing
room to the Assembled Lords, and out of
Parliament time was at the dispose of
Mr. <hi>Winyard</hi> the Keeper of the place, and
Wardrobe thereto belonging: these did
<hi>Percy</hi> hire for his Lodgings, entertaining
<hi>Fawkes</hi> as his man, who changing his name
into <hi>Johnson,</hi> had the Keyes, and keeping
of the rooms commended to him; Besides
this, they hired another House to lay in
provision of Powder, and to frame and fit
Wood in for the carrying on the Mine,
which <hi>Catesby</hi> provided at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and
sware <hi>Robert Keies</hi> into their Conspiracy,
whom he made the Keeper of those provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
who by night conveyed the same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Fawkes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:41458:45"/>
The appointed day for the Parliament
being the seventh day of <hi>February,</hi> It was
thought fit to begin their work in <hi>October</hi>
before: but <hi>Fawkes</hi> returning out of the
Country, found <hi>Percies</hi> rooms appointed
for the Scottish Lords to meet in, who were
to treat about the union of the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
whereupon they forbore for a while
to begin their work: But that Assembly
being soon dissolved, upon the eleventh of
<hi>December</hi> late in the night they entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their work of darkness, beginning their
Mine, having tools aforehand prepared,
and baked meats provided, the better to
avoid suspicion, in case they should send
abroad for them.</p>
                  <p>They which first began the Mine, were
<hi>Robert Catesby</hi> Esquire, the Arch-Contriver
and Traitor, and ruine of his name, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Percy</hi> Esquire, a Kin to the Earl of
<hi>Northumberland, Thomas Winter, John
Wright, Guy Fawkes,</hi> Gentlemen, and
<hi>Thomas Bates, Catesbies</hi> Man, all of them
well grounded in the <hi>Romish</hi> School, and
earnest labourers in this Vault of Villany,
so that by <hi>Christmas-Eve</hi> they had brought
the Mine under an Entry adjoining to
the Wall of the Parliament-House,
under-propping the Earth as they went
with their framed Timber, nor till
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41458:46"/>
that day were they seen abroad of any
man.</p>
                  <p>During this undermining, much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation
was had, how to order the rest of
the business, when the deed should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished:
the first was, how to surprise
the next Heir to the Crown: for though
they doubted not but that Prince <hi>Henry</hi>
would Accompany his Father, and perish
with him, yet they suspected that Duke
<hi>Charles,</hi> as too young to attend the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
would escape the train, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
be so carefully guarded, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at Court, that he would be gotten into
their hands hardly; But <hi>Percy</hi> offered to
be the remover of this rub, resolving with
some other Gentlemen to enter the Dukes
Chamber, which by reason of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
he might well do, and others of his
like acquaintance should be placed at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Doors of the Court, so that when the
blow was given, and all men in a maze,
then would he carry away the Duke,
which he presumed would be easily done,
the most of the Court being then absent,
and for such as were present, they would
be altogether unprovided for resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                  <p>For the surprize of the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
it was held a matter of far less difficulty,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41458:46"/>
she remaining at <hi>Comb Abbey</hi> in <hi>Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>
with the Lord <hi>Harrington,</hi> and <hi>Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,
Catesbies</hi> House being not far from the
same, whither under a pretence of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon <hi>Dunsmore</hi> Heath, many Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
should be assembled, who knowing
for what purpose they were met, had the
full liberty in that distracted time to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
Money, Horses, Armor, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries
for War, under pretence of
strengthning and guarding the Heir Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to the Crown.</p>
                  <p>Then it was debated what Lords they
should save from the Parliament, and it
was agreed that they should keep as many
as they could that were Catholicks or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers
of them; but that all others
should feel the smart, and that the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
should be charged upon the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
to make them more odious to the
World.</p>
                  <p>Next it was controverted what Foreign
Princes they should make Privy to this
Plot seeing they could not enjoin them
secresie, nor oblige them by Oath, and this
much troubled them. For though <hi>Spain</hi>
was held fittest to second their Plot, yet he
was slow in his preparations, and <hi>France</hi>
was too near and too dangerous to be
dealth with, and how the <hi>Hollanders</hi> stood
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41458:47"/>
affected to <hi>England</hi> they knew very well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But while they were thus busying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and tormenting their brains, the
Parliament was again adjourned to the
fifth day of <hi>October</hi> ensuing, whereupon
they brake off both discourse, and work till
<hi>Candlemas,</hi> and then they laid in Powder,
and other Provisions, beginning their work
again, and having in the mean time taken
into their Company <hi>Christopher Wright,</hi>
and <hi>Robert Winter,</hi> being first sworn, and
receiving the Sacrament for secresie; the
foundation Wall of the Parliament-House,
being very hard and nine foot thick,
with great difficulty they wrought half
through; <hi>Fawkes</hi> being their Centinel
to give warning when any came near,
that the noise in digging might not be
heard.</p>
                  <p>The Labourers thus working into the
Wall, were suddenly surprized with a
great fear, and casting away their digging
Tools, betook themselves to their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
having sufficient shot and Powder in
the House, and fully resolving rather to
die in the place than to yield or be taken.
The cause of this their fear was a noise that
they heard in a room under the Parliament
House, under which they meant to have
Mined, which was directly under the Chair
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41458:47"/>
of State; but now all on a sudden they
were at a stand, and their Countenances
cast each upon other, as doubtful what
would be the Issue of their enterprize.
<hi>Fawkes</hi> scouted out to see what he could
discover abroad, and finding all safe, and
free from suspicion, he returned, and told
them that the noise was only occasioned by
the removal of Coals that were now upon
Sale, and that the Cellar was to be let,
which would be more commodious for
their purpose, and also would save their
labour for the Mine. Hereupon <hi>Thomas
Percy,</hi> under pretence of Stowage for his
Winter provision and Coals, went and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Cellar; which done they began a
new Conference, wherein <hi>Catesby</hi> found
the weight of the whole work too heavy
for himself alone to support: for besides
the maintenance of so many persons, and
the several Houses for the several uses hired,
and paid for by him, the Gunpowder and
other Provisions would rise to a very great
sum, and indeed too much for one mans
Purse. He desired therefore that himself,
<hi>Percy,</hi> and one more might call in such
persons as they thought fit to help to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the charge, alledging that they knew
men of worth and wealth that would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
assist, but were not willing that their
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41458:48"/>
names should be known to the rest. This
request, as necessary, was approved, and
therefore ceasing to dig any further in the
Vault, knowing that the Cellar would be
fitter for their purpose, they removed into
it twenty Barrels of Gunpowder, which
they covered with a thousand Billets, and
five hundred Faggots, so that now their
lodging rooms were cleared of all suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
provision, and might be freely entered
into without danger of discovery.</p>
                  <p>But the Parliament being again Proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
to the fifth of <hi>November</hi> following,
these persons thought sit that for a while
they should again disperse themselves (all
things being already in so good a forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness)
and that <hi>Guy Fawkes</hi> should go over
to acquaint Sir <hi>William Stanley,</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<hi>Hugh Owen</hi> with these their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
yet so, as the Oath of secresie should
be first taken by them. For their design
was to have Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi>'s presence
so soon as the fatal blow should be given,
to be a Leader to their intended strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems,
whereof (as they thought) they
should have great need, and that <hi>Owen</hi>
should remain where he was, to hold cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency
with Foreign Princes, to allay
the odiousness of the fact, and to impute the
Treason to the discontented <hi>Puritanes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:41458:48"/>
                     <hi>Fawkes</hi> coming into <hi>Flanders</hi> found
<hi>Owen,</hi> unto whom, after the Oath, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
the Plot, which he very well appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of, but Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi> being now
in <hi>Spain, Owen</hi> said, that he would hardly
be drawn into the business, having suits at
this time in the <hi>English</hi> Court: yet he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to ingage him all he could, and to
send him into <hi>England</hi> with the first, so
soon as their Plot had taken effect: Upon
this, <hi>Fawkes</hi> to avoid further suspicion, kept
still in <hi>Flanders</hi> all the beginning of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
and then returning, received the Keyes
of the Cellar, and laid in more Powder,
Billets and Faggots, which done he retired
into the Country, and there kept till the
end of <hi>October.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Percy</hi> meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the <hi>Bath,</hi> it was there concluded that
because their number was but few, <hi>Catesby</hi>
himself should have power to call in whom
he would to assist their design, by which
Authority he took in S<hi rend="sup">ir</hi> 
                     <hi>Everard Digby</hi> of
<hi>Rutlandshire,</hi> and <hi>Francis Tresham</hi> Esquire
of <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> both of them of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
state and wealth; For Sir <hi>Everard</hi>
offered fifteen hundred pounds to forward
the action, and <hi>Tresham</hi> two thousand. But
<hi>Percy</hi> disdaining that any should out-run
him in evil, promised four thousand pounds
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41458:49"/>
out of the Earl of <hi>Northumberlands</hi> Rents,
and ten swift Horses to be used when the
blow was past. Against which time to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
ammunition, <hi>Catesby</hi> also took in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose
Rookwood,</hi> and <hi>John Grant,</hi> two Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Gentlemen, and without doubt others
were acquainted also with it, had these two
grand Electors been apprehended alive,
whose own tongues only could have given
an account of it.</p>
                  <p>The business being thus forwarded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
by their complices, they at home
were no less active: For <hi>Percy, Winter,</hi> and
<hi>Fawkes</hi> had stored this Cellar with thirty
six Barrels of Gunpowder, and instead of
shot, had laid upon them Bars of Iron, logs
of Timber, massie Stones, Iron Crowes,
Pick-Axes, and all their working Tools,
and to cover all, great store of Billets and
Faggots, so that nothing was wanting
against that great and terrible day. Neither
were the Priests and Jesuits slack on their
parts, who usually concluded their Masses
with Prayers for the good success of their
expected hopes, about which <hi>Garnet</hi> made
these Verses,</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Gentem aufer perfidam credentium

                     <hi>And others thus.</hi> Prosper Lord their pains
that labour in thy cause day and night: Let
Heresie vanish away like smoke: Let their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
perish with a crack like the ruine and fall
of a broken house.</p>
                  <p>Upon <hi>Thursday</hi> in the Evening, ten days
before the Parliament was to begin, a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
directed to the Lord <hi>Monteagle,</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by an unknown person to his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in the street, with a strait charge to
give it into his Lords own hands, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
he did: The Letter had neither
date, nor subscription, and was somewhat
unlegible, so that the Nobleman called for
one of his servants to assist him in reading
it; the strange contents whereof much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
him, he not knowing whether it
was writ as a <hi>Pasquil</hi> to scare him from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
at the Parliament, or as matter of
consequence, and advice from some friend:
Howsoever, though it were now Supper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
and the night very dark, yet to shew
his loyalty to his Sovereign, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
repaired to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and imparted
the Letter to the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> then
principal Secretary, who reading the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and hearing how it came to the Lord
<hi>Monteagles</hi> hands, highly commended his
Prudence and Loyalty for discovering it,
telling him plainly that whatsoever might
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41458:50"/>
be the event, yet it put him in mind of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Advertisements, wherewithal he had
acquainted both the King, and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
of some great business which the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
were in hand with, both at home and
abroad against this Parliament, pretending
a Petition to the King and Parliament for a
toleration of their Religion, but withal,
giving out, that it should be delivered in
such an order, and so well backed, that the
King should be loth to refuse their request.
Then did the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> presently
acquaint the Lord <hi>Chamberlain</hi> therewith,
who deemed the matter not a little to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
himself; his Office requiring him to
oversee all the places to which his Majesty
was to repair: Hereupon these two Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors
shewed the Letter to the Earls of
<hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Northampton,</hi> and all conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
(how slight soever the contents seemed
to appear) to acquaint the King himself
with the same, which accordingly was done
by the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who upon <hi>Friday</hi>
in the Afternoon (being <hi>All-Saints</hi> day)
taking the King into the Gallery at <hi>White-hall,</hi>
communicated the Letter to him,
which was as followeth,</p>

                     <floatingText xml:lang="eng">

                              <p>OVT of the love I bear to some
of your friends, I have a care
of your preservation: Therefore I
would advise you as you tender your
life, to devise some excuse to shift off
your attendance at this Parliament:
For God and Man have concurred to
punish the wickedness of this time.
And think not slightly of this adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement,
but retire your self into
your Country, where you may expect
the event in safety. For though there
be no appearance of any stir, yet I
say they shall receive a terrible blow
this Parliament, and yet they shall
not see who hurts them. This coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
is not to be contemned, because it
may do you good, and can do you no
harm: For the danger is past so soon
as you have burnt the Letter; and
I hope God will give you the Grace to
make a good use of it, to whose holy
protection I commend you.</p>
                           </div>

His Majesty after reading this Letter,
pausing a while, and then reading it again,
delivered his judgment, that the stile of it
was too quick and pithy to be a Libel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the superfluities of an idle
brain, and by these words, <hi>That they should
receive a terrible blow at this Parliament, and
yet not see who hurt them;</hi> he presently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
that a sudden danger by a blast
of Gunpowder was intended by some base
Villain in a Corner, though no insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
rebellion, or desperate attempt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared:
But the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the King to apprehend it deeplier
than he expected, told his Majesty that he
judged by one sentence in it that it was
written either by a Fool, or a Mad-man.
For said he, <hi>If the danger be past as soon as
you have burnt the Letter,</hi> then the warning
is to little purpose, when the burning of
the Letter may prevent the danger.</p>
                  <p>But the King on the contrary, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the former sentence, <hi>That they should
receive a terrible blow at this Parliament, and
yet should not see who hurt them,</hi> joining it
with this other sentence, did thereupon
conclude that the danger mentioned should
be very sudden by some blast of Gun-Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
interpreting <hi>as soon,</hi> for, <hi>as quickly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
and therefore wished that the rooms under
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41458:51"/>
the Parliament-House should be thoroughly
searched, before Himself or Peers should
sit therein: Hereupon it was concluded
that the Lord <hi>Chamberlain</hi> (according to
his Office) should view all the rooms
above and below: but yet, to prevent idle
rumors and to let things ripen further, it
was resolved that this search should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
till <hi>Munday,</hi> the day immediately
before the Parliament, and that then it
should be done with a seeming slight eye
to avoid suspect.</p>
                  <p>According to this conclusion, the Earl of
<hi>Suffolk,</hi> Lord <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> upon <hi>Munday</hi>
in the Afternoon, accompanied with the
Lord <hi>Monteagle,</hi> repaired into those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
rooms, and finding the Cellar so fully
stored with Wood and Coals, demanded of
<hi>Fawkes,</hi> the counterfeit <hi>Johnson,</hi> who stood
there attending as a servant of small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
<hi>Who owed the place?</hi> He answered that
the Lodgings belonged to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Thomas Percy,</hi>
and the Cellar also, to lay in his Winter-provision,
himself being the Keeper of it
and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Percies</hi> Servant; whereunto the
Earl, as void of any suspicion, told him
that his Master was well provided against
Winter blasts: But when they were come
forth, the Lord <hi>Monteagle</hi> told him that
he did much suspect <hi>Percy</hi> to be the Inditer
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41458:52"/>
of the Letter, knowing his affection in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the friendship betwixt them
professed, so that his heart gave him (as
he said) when he heard <hi>Percy</hi> named, that
his hand was in the act.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Chamberlain</hi> returning, related
to the King and Council what he had seen,
and the suspicion that the Lord <hi>Monteagle</hi>
had of <hi>Percy,</hi> and himself of <hi>Johnson</hi> his
man, all which increased his Majesties jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie,
so that he insisted that a narrower
search should be made, and the Billets and
Coals turned up to the bottom; of the same
mind also were all the Privy-Counsellors
then present: but for the manner how the
search was to be made, they agreed not
among themselves. For on the one part
they were very solicitous for the Kings
safety, concluding that there could not be
too much caution used for preventing his
danger: and yet on the other part they
were all extreme loth (in case this Letter
should prove nothing but the evaporation
of some idle brain) that a too curious
search should be made, lest, if nothing were
found, it should turn to the great scandal
of the King and State, as being so suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
upon every light and frivolous toy: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
it would lay an ill-favoured imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> one
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41458:52"/>
of his Majesties greatest Subjects, and
Counsellors, This <hi>Thomas Percy</hi> being his
Kinsman, and intimate Friend. Yet at
last the search was concluded to be made,
but under colour of searching for certain
Hangings belonging to the House, which
were missing and conveyed away.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Knevet</hi> (a Gentleman of his
Majesties Privy-Chamber, and a Justice of
Peace in <hi>Westminster)</hi> was imployed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
who about midnight before the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was to begin, went to the place with
a small, but trusty number of persons: and
at the door of the entrance to the Cellar,
finding one (who was <hi>Guy Fawkes)</hi> at so
unseasonable an hour, Cloked, and Booted,
he apprehended him, and ransacking the
Billets, he found the Serpents Nest stored
with thirty six Barrels of Powder, and then
searching the Villain, he found about him
a dark Lanthorn, three Matches, and other
instruments for blowing up the Powder:
And <hi>Fawkes</hi> being no whit daunted, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
confessed his guiltiness, and was so
far from repentance, as he vowed, that
had he been within the House (as indeed
he was but immediately come forth from
his work) he would certainly have blown
up the House with himself and them all:
and being brought before the Council, he
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41458:53"/>
lamented nothing so much as because the
deed was not done, saying, that <hi>the Devil,
and not God, was the discoverer of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed when this Prisoner was first
brought into <hi>Whitehall,</hi> in respect of the
strangeness of the thing, no man was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
from seeing, and speaking with
him, and not long after the Lords of the
Council examined him: But he put on
such a <hi>Romane</hi> resolution, that both to the
Council, and to all others that spake to
him that day, he seemed fixed, and settled
in his resolution of concealing his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and notwithstanding the horror of
the fact, the guiltiness of his Conscience,
his sudden surprize, the terror which should
have been stricken into him, by coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the presence of so noble and grave a
Council, and the restless and confused
questions that every man all that day did
vex him with; yet was his countenance so
far from being dejected, that he often smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in a scornful manner, answering quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to every mans questions, scoffing at
those that were impertinent, and jesting
at such as he thought had no authority to
examine him. Before the Council he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to answer to such questions as he
thought might discover the Plot: took
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41458:53"/>
all the blame upon himself, whereunto
he said he was moved only for Religion,
and Conscience sake: denying the King
to be his lawful Sovereign, because he was
an Heretick.</p>
                  <p>As desperate were <hi>Catesby, Percy,</hi> and the
rest, who seeing the treason discover'd,
posted all into <hi>Warwickshire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About the same hour of the night where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Fawkes</hi> was apprehended, one <hi>Grant</hi> a
Gentleman, having associated to himself
others of his opinion, all desperate <hi>Papists,</hi>
broke open the Stables of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Bennock,</hi> a
Rider of great Horses at <hi>Warwick</hi> Castle,
and carried away eight of them, which
belonged to divers Noblemen, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of that Country, who had put them
into M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Bennock</hi>'s hand to fit them for their
service, and so both they which had fled
from <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Grant</hi> and his Company
met on that <hi>Tuesday</hi> night at <hi>Dun-Church,</hi>
at Sir <hi>Everard Digbies</hi> Lodgings, who had
made a match for a great Hunting, upon
<hi>Dunsmore-heath,</hi> that under pretence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they might seize upon the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
then at <hi>Comb-Abbey,</hi> with the Lord <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington,</hi>
but when by those which posted
from <hi>London</hi> they were informed that they
were discovered, and pursued, being struck
with a great fear, not knowing whither to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41458:54"/>
fly, they desperately began an open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
pretending that they did it for the
cause of Religion, all the Catholicks
throats being intended to be cut.</p>
                  <p>But the violent taking away of those
Horses in the night, seemed even in the eyes
of the common-people to be so great a
riot, though they knew nothing more, that
it begat in their hearts a suspicion of some
following Rebellion, so that all sorts both
great and small began to arm themselves
upon this unexpected accident. And old
Sir <hi>Fulk Grevil</hi> of <hi>Beauchamps-Court,</hi> being
Deputy-Lieutenant of <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> though
aged and infirm, yet out of his zeal for the
peace and welfare of his Country, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
took order to get into his hands the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition
and Arms of all such Gentlemen
as were absent from their Houses, or <hi>Popishly</hi>
affected, and sent such directions to the
Towns about him, that thereupon when
these Rebels came to <hi>Ilcester,</hi> a poor
Smith stroke <hi>Winter,</hi> who had likewise
been taken by the Townsmen but that he
was rescued by his Companions. Yet six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
of their followers were taken and sent
to the Sheriff at <hi>Warwick,</hi> and from thence
to <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time the rest wandred
through <hi>Warwickshire,</hi> being pursued by
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41458:54"/>
Sir <hi>Richard Verney,</hi> the then High-Sheriff,
and from thence they went through <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestershire</hi>
into the Borders of <hi>Staffordshire,</hi>
their Servants and followers being about
eighty men, who also stole away many of
them from them. Thus ranging about, and
finding no resistance, they rifled the Lord
<hi>Windsors</hi> House of all the Armour, Shot,
Powder, and all other Warlike provisions:
but the weather being rainy, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
somewhat high, the Powder in Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
took wet, and so became unservice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>For their last refuge they betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to <hi>Holbach</hi> House in <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to <hi>Steven Littleton,</hi> whither they
were pursued by the High-Sheriff of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestershire,</hi>
who not knowing of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and thinking it to be only some fray,
or riot, sent his Trumpeter unto them,
commanding them to render themselves to
him his Majesties Minister: But their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
witnessing what the Sheriff knew
not, answered, <hi>that he had need of greater
assistance than of those few that were with
him, before he could be able to command or
controul them:</hi> and so they prepared for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
and having laid two pounds of
the said Powder into a Platter to dry in the
Chimney, one coming to mend the fire
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41458:55"/>
threw in a Billet, whereby a spark flew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Powder, whose sudden blast was so
violent, that though so small a quantity,
it blew up the roof of the House, scorching
the Bodies and Faces of <hi>Catesby, Rookwood,</hi>
and <hi>Grant,</hi> and some others, whose Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
now told them that God had pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
them justly with Powder, who with
Powder would have destroyed so many.
Being dispirited with this accident, yet
like desperate men, they resolved to die
together, set open the Gates, and suffered
the Sheriffs men to rush in upon them, and
presently both the <hi>Wrights</hi> were shot down
dead: <hi>Rookwood</hi> and <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> were
very sorely wounded, <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Percy</hi> des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately
fighting back to back, were both
shot through, and slain with one Musket
Bullet: the rest being taken, were carried
Prisoners to <hi>London,</hi> being all the way ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
at, reviled and detested by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people for their horrid, and horrible
treason: and so at last they received the
just guerdon of their wickedness.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have seen this work of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
by the watchfulness of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
detected and defeated, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers
of mischief faln into the Pit that
they digged for others: Now let us see
also how cunningly they contrived the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41458:55"/>
transferring the <hi>Odium</hi> of it upon the
Puritans.</p>
                  <p>There was one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Pickering</hi> of <hi>Tich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marsh-Grove</hi>
in <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> that was
in great esteem with King <hi>James.</hi> This
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Pickering</hi> had a Horse of special note
for swiftness, on which he used to hunt with
the King. A little before the blow was
given, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Keies,</hi> one of the Conspirators
and Brother in Law to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Pickering,</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
this Horse of him, and conveyed
him to <hi>London</hi> upon a bloody design which
was thus contrived. <hi>Fawks</hi> upon the day of
the fatal blow was appointed to retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into St. <hi>Georges</hi> Fields, where this
Horse was to attend him to further his es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
(as they made him believe) so soon
as the Parliament House should be blown
up. It was likewise contrived, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                     <hi>Pickering</hi> who was noted for a Puritan,
should that Morning be murthered in his
Bed, and secretly conveyed away: as also
that <hi>Fawks</hi> so soon as he came into <hi>Georges</hi>
Fields to escape, should be there murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and so mangled, that he could not be
known: whereupon it was to be bruited
abroad that the Puritans had blown up the
Parliament-House, and the better to make
the World believe it, there was M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering</hi>
with his choice Horse ready to make
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:41458:56"/>
an escape, but that stirred up some, who
seeing the hainousness of the fact, and him
ready to escape, in detestation of so horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a deed, fell upon him and hewed him
in pieces, and to make it more clear, there
was his Horse, known to be of special
speed and swiftness, ready to carry him
away, and upon this rumor a Massacre
should have gone through the whole land
upon the Puritans. When the contrivance
of this Plot was thus discovered by some of
the Conspirators, and <hi>Faux,</hi> who was now
a Prisoner in the Tower made acquainted
with it, whereas before he was made to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
by his Companions that he should be
bountifully rewarded for that his good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to the Catholick Cause, now percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that on the contrary his Death had
been contrived by them, he thereupon
freely confessed all that he knew concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that horrid Conspiracy, which before
all the tortures of the rack could not force
him unto.</p>
                  <p>The truth of all this was attested by
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>William Perkins,</hi> an eminent Christian
and Citizen of <hi>London</hi> to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Gouge,</hi> which
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Perkins</hi> had it from the mouth of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                     <hi>Clement Cotton,</hi> that made our <hi>English</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance,
who also had it from the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Pickering</hi> himself.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:41458:56"/>
The Names of those that were first in this
Treason and laboured in the Mine, were</p>
                  <p>Robert Catesby, Robert Winter, <hi>Esquires;</hi>
Thomas Percy, Thomas Winter, John Wright,
Christopher Wright, Guy Fawkes, <hi>Gentlemen,

                  </p>
                  <p>Persons made acquainted with it, and

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sir</hi> Everard Digby, <hi>Knight;</hi> Ambrose
Rookwood, Francis Tresham, <hi>Esquires;</hi> John
Grant, <hi>Gentleman;</hi> Robert Keyes.</p>
                  <p>This prodigious contrivance did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stupifie the whole Kingdom with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation
and amazement, but Foreign
Princes, at least, seemed to wonder at it
also, and though (for the propagation of
the <hi>Catholick cause)</hi> they might have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
enough to wish that it had taken
effect, yet they had policy enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate
the discoverers; and some of
them, to take off the asperity of the sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
sweetned their expressions with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
rich gifts to our King and Queen.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament by reason of the hurry
occasioned hereby, met not till the ninth
of <hi>November:</hi> at which time <hi>Henry</hi> Lord
<hi>Mordant,</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>Sturton</hi> not
coming to the Parliament according to
their <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Summons,</hi> were suspected as
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41458:57"/>
having knowledge of the Conspiracy; and
so was the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> from
some presumptions, and all three were
Committed to the <hi>Tower.</hi> The two Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
after a while were redeemed by fine
in <hi>Starchamber,</hi> but the Earl continued a
Prisoner there for many years after.</p>
                  <p>How the Parliament was affected for this
great deliverance of the whole Kingdom
from ruine and destruction, will appear
by the <hi>Act</hi> which they made to have the
fifth of <hi>November</hi> for ever solemnized with
<hi>Publick Thanksgiving:</hi> wherein they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
the discovery of the Treason to the
inspiring the King with a divine spirit to
interpret some dark <hi>Phrases</hi> of the Letter,
above, and beyond all ordinary constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
they attainted also the blood of those
Traytors that were executed, as also of
those that were slain at <hi>Holbach</hi>-House, or
that died in Prison: and the King being
not unmindful of the Lord <hi>Monteagle,</hi> the
first discoverer of this Treason, gave him,
and his Heirs for ever, two hundred pounds
a year in Fee-Farm Rents, and 500<hi rend="sup">l</hi> a year
besides, during his life, as a reward for his
good service. But now to the <hi>Act</hi> it self.</p>

the said House with Gunpowder; an inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
so inhumane, barbarous, and cruel, as

(as some of the principal Conspirators confess)
purposely devised, and concluded to be done in the

                  <head>A Narrative of the visible hand
of God upon the Papists by the
downfal in Black-Friers, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Anno Christi 1623.</head>
                  <p>ON the Lords day, <hi>October</hi> the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
sixth according to the <hi>English</hi>
account, but <hi>November</hi> the fifth
according to the <hi>Popish</hi> account, went far
and near, that one <hi>Drury</hi> a <hi>Romist Priest</hi>
(a man of parts, and eminent gifts) would
preach that day in the afternoon in a fair
house in <hi>Black-Friers, London,</hi> whither all
that would might freely come and hear
him.</p>
                  <p>Upon this report very many, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
as well as Papists, Scholars as well
as others, assembled thither about three a
Clock in the Afternoon. That mansion
house was now inhabited by the <hi>French</hi>
Ambassador: and the Sermon was to be in
a Garret, into which there were two pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages:
One out of the Ambassadors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
room which was private, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more common without the great gate
of the said mansion house.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:41458:60"/>
Under this Garret was another large
chamber which one <hi>Redyate,</hi> another Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Priest, had hired for himself: Unto
whom Papists frequently repaired to hear
Mass, and make confessions. Under this
room was the aforesaid withdrawing cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Ambassadors: supported with
strong Arches of stone, being immediately
over the entrance into the great house:
And at the South-end of the Garret, and
on the West-side thereof, there were bed-chambers,
and Closets which other Priests
had hired for themselves: The bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
at the South-end, was severed from
the Garret only by a partition of Wains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cote
which was taken down for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-time:
The length of the Garret from
North to South was almost 40 foot, the
breadth about 16 foot: The two aforesaid
passages met on one pair of stairs leading
to the Garret which had only that one door
leading into it.</p>
                  <p>More came to this place than possibly it
could hold, so that many for want of room
returned back again: others went into the
aforesaid <hi>Redyates</hi> chamber, and tarried
with him. The whole Garret, rooms adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
door, and top of the stairs were as full
as they could hold. In the Garret were set
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41458:61"/>
chairs and stools for the better sort: most
of the women sate on the floor, but most of
the men stood thronged together: Inall, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
200 were there assembled. In the midst
was a table and a chair for the Preacher.</p>
                  <p>All things thus prepared, and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
assembled, about three a clock the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Preacher, having on a Surplice girt
about his middle with a linnen girdle, and
a tippet of Scarlet on both his shouldiers,
came in, being attended by a man that
brought after him his Book and Hour-glass.</p>
                  <p>As soon as he came to the table, he kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
down with shew of private devotion for
a little while: then rising up, and turning
himself to the people, he crossed himself,
took the book (which was said to be a <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
Testament)</hi> out of his mans hands, and
the hour-glass being set on the table, he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
the book, read the Gospel appointed
by the <hi>Romish Calender</hi> for that day, being
the twenty first Sunday after <hi>Pentecost:</hi> The
Gospel was in <hi>Mat. 18. 23, &amp;c.</hi> The Text
being read, he sate down, put on a red cap
over a white linnen one turned up about
the brims: He made no audible prayer,
but having read his Text, which was the
parable of forgiving debts, he spake some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the occasions of it, and then
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41458:61"/>
propounded these three special points to
be handled.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The debt we owe to God.</item>
                     <item>2. The mercy of God in forgiving it.</item>
                     <item>3. Mans unmercifulness to his brother.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Having insisted some while on the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of man by reason of the debt wherein he
stands bound to God, he passed on to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the rich mercy of God, and the means
which God hath afforded to his Church, for
partaking thereof: Amongst which he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
up the Sacraments, and especially
pressed the Sacrament of <hi>Penance,</hi> as they
call it.</p>
                  <p>When he had discoursed on these points
about half an hour, on a sudden the floor
whereon the preacher and the greatest
part of his auditory were, fell down with
such violence, as therewith the floor of
the chamber under it where <hi>Redyate</hi> and
his company were, was broken down with
it, so that both the floors, with the beams,
girders, joyces, boards, and feelings, with
all the people on them, fell down toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon the third floor, which was the
floor of the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
chamber, supported with strong arches
as aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>There being a partition on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41458:62"/>
of the middle chamber which reached
up to the floor of the Garret, which was
at the Northwest corner. Hereupon some
through amazement, would have leaped
out at a window almost forty foot from the
ground: but the people without, telling
them of the certain danger if they leaped
down, kept them from that desperate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:
At length by breaking a wall on the
West side they discerned chambers adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereto, and so by creeping through that
hole into the chambers, they were saved: So
were all they that stood on the stair-head
at the door leading into the Garret: For
the stairs were without the room, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
fell but the floors, neither walls nor
roof.</p>
                  <p>Also amongst those that fell, many esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
for some of the timber rested with one
end on the Walls, and with the other on the
third floor that yielded not, and so both
such as abode on those pieces, and such as
were directly under them, were thereby
preserved. Amongst the multitude that
fell, there was a Minister who (through
Gods providence) fell so between two
pieces of timber, as that the timber kept
his upper-parts from crushing: and holp
him by his clasping about the timber to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41458:62"/>
pull out his feet from among the dead
corpses.</p>
                  <p>Amongst others, the present preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and future destruction of one <hi>Parker</hi> was
very remarkable. This <hi>Parker</hi> was a factor
for the <hi>English</hi> Seminaries, and Nuns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Sea, especially at <hi>Cambre;</hi> and he had
so dealt with two of his brothers here, that
he had got from one of them a son, and
from the other a daughter, to send them to
religious houses (as they falsly call them)
beyond sea. This <hi>Parker</hi> at this time took
his Nephew, a youth of about sixteen years
old to the aforementioned fatal Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
where <hi>Drury</hi> preached: and both <hi>Parker</hi>
and his Nephew fell with the rest: The
youth there lost his life, but <hi>Parker</hi> himself
escaped with a bruised body, being a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent
man: yet so far was he from making
a good use of his deliverance, that with
much discontent he wished he had died for
his Nephew, saying, <hi>that God saw him not
fit to die amongst such Martyrs.</hi> Many such
Martyrs have been made at <hi>Tyburn</hi> for trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
Such are <hi>Romes</hi> Martyrs. But <hi>the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the wicked, is but a reservation to
future judgments;</hi> for about ten dayes after,
as this <hi>Parker</hi> was shooting <hi>London-Bridge</hi>
with his aforesaid Neece, whom he was
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41458:63"/>
conveying beyond Sea, they were both cast
away, and drowned in the <hi>Thames. Judge
by this</hi> (O Parents) <hi>whether God is well
pleased with disposing your Children to Popish
education.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others there were that were pulled out
alive, but so bruised, or so spent for want
of breath, that some lived not many hours,
others died not many days after.</p>
                  <p>The floor of the chamber immediately
over this, where the Corps lay, being fallen,
there was no entrance into it but through
the Ambassadours Bed-Chamber, the door
whereof was closed up with the Timber of
the floors that fell down; and the walls of
this room were of stone, only there was one
window in it with extraordinary strong
cross barrs of Iron, so that though Smiths
and other workmen were immediately sent
for, yet it was more than an hour before
succour could be afforded to them that were
fallen down.</p>
                  <p>Passage at length being made, I had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
into the room (saith Doctor <hi>Gouge,</hi> the
relater of this story) and viewing the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
observed some (yet but few to be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
wounded) or crushed by the Timber.
Others to be apparently stifled, partly with
their thick lying one upon another, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41458:63"/>
partly with the dust that came from the
feeling which fell down.</p>
                  <p>On the Lords day at night when they fell
they were numbred ninety one dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
but many of them were secretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
away in the night, there being a
pair of water-stairs leading from the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
appertaining to the House, into the
<hi>Thames.</hi> On the morrow the Coroner and
his Inquest coming to view the bodies
found remaining but sixty three.</p>
                  <p>Of those that were carried away some
were buried in a burying place within the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadors house in <hi>Holborn,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
whom the Lady <hi>Web</hi> was one, the
Lady <hi>Blackstones</hi> Daughter another, and
one Mistris <hi>Vdal</hi> a third: Master <hi>Stoker,</hi>
and Master <hi>Bartholmew Bavin</hi> were buried
in <hi>Brides</hi> Parish. <hi>Robert Sutton, John Loccham,</hi>
and <hi>Abigail Holford</hi> in <hi>Andrews Holborn.</hi>
Captain <hi>Summers</hi> wife in the vault under
<hi>Black-Friers</hi> Church, and her woman in
the Church-yard. For the Corps remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
two great Pits were digged, one in
the fore Court of the said <hi>French</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
House eighteen foot long, and twelve
foot broad; the other in the Garden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
his House, Twelve foot long, and
eight foot broad. In the former Pit were
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41458:64"/>
laid forty four Corps, whereof the Bodies
of the aforesaid <hi>Drury</hi> and <hi>Redyate</hi> were
two. These two wound up in sheets, were
first laid into the Pit, with a Partition of
loose Earth to sever them from the rest.
Then were others brought, some in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
a decent manner wound up in sheets,
but the most in a most lamentable plight,
the shirts only of the men tyed under the
twists, and some linnen tyed about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Women, the rest of their Bodies
naked, and one poor Man, or Woman ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Corps by the Head, another by the
Feet tumbled them in, and so piled them
up almost to the top of the Pit. The rest
were put into the other Pit in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
                  <p>Their manner of burial seemed almost as
dismal, as the heap of them, when they lay
upon the floor where they last fell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequies
of funeral rites were used at their
Burial. Only the day after, a black Cross
of wood was set upon each Grave, but was
soon by authority commanded to be taken
down.</p>
                  <p>When they were thus interred, thorough
search was made about the cause of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Timber: The Timber of each
floor was laid together, and the measure of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41458:64"/>
the Summers that brake was taken. The
main Summer which crossed the Garret
was ten Inches square: Two Girders were
by Tenents, and Mortaises let into the
middest of it, one just against another:
the Summer was knotty where the Mortai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
were made, whereupon being over-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened,
it knapped suddenly asunder in the
middest.</p>
                  <p>The main Summer of the other floor that
fell was much stronger, being thirteen
Inches square, strong and sound every
where, neither did the Girders meet so just
one against another; yet that also failed,
not in the middest as the uppermost, but
within five foot of one end, and that more
shiveringly, and with a longer rent in the
Timber than the other. For this Chamber
was almost full with such persons as come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too late, went into <hi>Redyates</hi> Chamber:
Besides, it did not only bear the weight
which lay on the upper floor, but received
it with a sudden knock, and so the massie
Timber shivered in two, and the people
were irrecoverably, before they could fear
any such thing, beaten down into the third
floor, which was above twenty foot from
the first.</p>
                  <p>It's true we must not be rash in censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41458:65"/>
yet when we see judgments executed
on Sinners, in the act of their sin, when
they are impudent and presumptuous
therein, not to acknowledge such to be
judged by the Lord, is to wink against clear
light, <hi>Psal. 9. 16. God is known by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which he executeth.</hi> Shall <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi>
while he is vaunting of his great
<hi>Babylon,</hi> be bereft of his wits? Shall <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi>
whilst he is priding himself in the
flattering applause of the people, be eaten
with Worms? Shall <hi>Haman,</hi> whilst he is
practising to destroy all the people of
God, be hanged on a Gallows fifty foot
high which he had prepared for <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai?</hi>
Shall the House where the <hi>Philistins</hi>
met together to sport with <hi>Sampson,</hi> fall
upon their heads? Shall these and such like
judgments overtake men in the very act of
their sin, and yet be accounted no judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
no evidences of Gods revenging
Justice, or signs of his indignation? Truly
then we may deny all providence, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
all to chance: But add hereto, that
this fell out upon their fifth of <hi>November,</hi>
and it will be as clear as if written with
a Sunbeam, that the Pit which they
digged for others, they themselves fell
into it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:41458:65"/>
Doctor <hi>Gouge,</hi> who relates this story in
his <hi>Extent of Gods Providence,</hi> thus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.</p>
                  <p>I do the more confidently publish this
History, because I was an eye-witness of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the things therein related; and heard
from the mouths of such as were present at
the Sermon, the rest. For upon the first
hearing of the destruction of so many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
as by that downfal lost their lives,
our Constable presently caused the gates
of our Precinct (it being surrounded with
walls and gates) to be shut, and raised a
strong guard from amongst the inhabitants,
to keep the house where this accident fell
out, and to prevent tumults about it. Thus
through the favour of the Constables, and
Watch, who were all my neighbours, I
had the more free and quiet access to view
the dead bodies, and to inform my self of
all the material circumstances about that
accident: which I did the rather because the
Bishop of <hi>London</hi> that then was, sent to me
to inform my self throughly of all the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and to send him a narration thereof
under my hand; whereupon I did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
view matters my self, but caused Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to search the Timber, to take the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
both of the Timber and rooms. I was
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41458:66"/>
also present with the Coroner and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
at their examining of all circumstances
about the business. And the Arch-Bishop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> sending to me to come to him,
and to bring with me the best evidence I
could, I got the foreman of the Jury, and
four persons that were present at the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and fell down with the rest, but
by God's providence escaped death, and
one that stood without the door, within
hearing, but fell not; all these I got to go
along with me to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> where I heard
the witness which they gave to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
about this matter. One that fell
with the rest, and escaped death, was Master
<hi>Gee</hi> a Preacher in <hi>Lancashire;</hi> two others
were a son and servant to a Citizen in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Noster-Row:</hi>
The rest were men of good
understanding, able to apprehend what
they saw and heard, and to relate what
they conceived.</p>
