            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>THe Picture that is Printed in the front</l>
            <l>Is like this Kingdome, if you look upon't</l>
            <l>For if you well doe note it as it is,</l>
            <l>It is a Transform'd Metamorphasis.</l>
            <l>This Monstrous Picture plainely doth declare</l>
            <l>This land (quite out of order) out of square.</l>
            <l>His Breeches on his shoulders doe appeare,</l>
            <l>His doublet on his lower parts doth weare;</l>
            <l>His Boots and Spurs upon his Armes and Hands,</l>
            <l>His Gloves upon his feet (whereon he stands)</l>
            <l>The Church or'e turnd (a lamentable show)</l>
            <l>The Candlestick above, the light below,</l>
            <l>The Cony hunts the Dogge, the Rat the Cat,</l>

            <l>The Wheelbarrow doth drive the man (oh Base)</l>
            <l>And Eeles and Gudgeons flie a mighty pace.</l>
            <l>And sure this is a Monster of strange fashion,</l>
            <l>That doth surpasse all <hi>Ovids</hi> Transformation.</l>
            <l>And this is Englands case this very day,</l>
            <l>All things are turn'd the Cleane contrary way;</l>
            <l>For Now, when as a Royall Parliament,</l>

            <l>Have almost sate two yeeres, with paines and Cares,</l>
            <l>And Charge, to free us from our Griefes and feares,</l>

One would have this, Another would have that,</l>
            <l>And most of them would have they know not what.</l>
            <l>God give us peace, and ease us of our paine,</l>
            <l>And send those sects, from whence they came againe,</l>
            <l>The Papist, and the Schismatique; both grieves</l>
            <l>The <hi>Church,</hi> for shee's like <hi>Christ</hi> (Between two Thieves.)</l>
            <l>I took the Protestation twice of Late,</l>
            <l>VVhere I protested not to Innovate.</l>
            <l>'Tavoide all Popish Rites, and to expresse</l>
            <l>Obedience to what <hi>Englands</hi> Church professe,</l>
            <l>My Loyalty unto my King is bent</l>
            <l>VVith duty to the Peers and Parliament.</l>
            <l>VVith Prayers, and my best service for them all,</l>
            <l>That on them may Heavens chiefest blessings fall,</l>
            <l>That with one heart, as one man, with one minde,</l>
            <l>(For Gods great glory) they may be combinde,</l>
            <l>And never vary, but goe boldly on,</l>
            <l>To end the good worke, which they have begun.</l>
            <l>This is the Sum (which ne'er shall be forsooke)</l>
            <l>Of what I in the Protestation tooke.</l>
            <l>But, for all this, I may be mannerly</l>
            <l>In Gods House, and be free from Papistrie;</l>
            <l>I hope I may put off my hat, and be</l>
            <l>Allow'd to Kneel, and Pray, and Bow my Knee,</l>
            <l>VVhen as divine Command bids, onely then</l>
            <l>I'le Bow to God, and not to Saints, or Men.</l>
            <l>And from those dueties I will never vary</l>
            <l>Till death, or Order doe command contrary.</l>
            <l>Th' Almighties Name be ever prays'd and blest,</l>
            <l>That Romish superstition is supprest,</l>
            <l>VVee have no Abbyes, Abbots, Friars, or Monks,</l>
            <l>Nor have we Nuns, or Stewes allow'd for Punks,</l>
            <l>VVee have no Masses, or no Mass-Priests heere,</l>
            <l>But some are hang'd, and some are fled for feare.</l>

All those that are so bold to stay behind,</l>
            <l>I wish they may like entertainment finde;</l>
            <l>Beades, Bables, Relliques, Tapers, Lamps or Lights,</l>
            <l>Wee have no superstitious Romish Rites,</l>
            <l>Wee seek our Pardons from our Heavenly Hope,</l>
            <l>And not by works, or favour from the Pope;</l>
            <l>To Saints we make no prayer, or Intercession,</l>
            <l>And unto God alone wee make Confession;</l>
            <l>Wee hold no Reall Presence in the Bread,</l>
            <l>And wee doe know King <hi>Charles</hi> our supreame head</l>

            <l>No Stock, or carved Block, wee trust upon,</l>
            <l>Nor is our Church discretion heere so little,</l>
