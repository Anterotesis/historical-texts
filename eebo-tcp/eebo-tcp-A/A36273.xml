            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NOtwithſtanding many <hi>Warnings</hi> in the true love of God, have been ſent to thee, O Nation of <hi>England,</hi> from the higheſt to the loweſt; yet once more in the tender Love of God, is my heart opened for thy Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Welfare and Proſperity, that ſo the day of Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may not overtake you at unawares.

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:93358:3"/>
which made the Kings heart ſorrowful, but mark what became of them that laid the <hi>Snare</hi> privily to deſtroy the Innocent; for the <hi>Snare</hi> that they had laid for <hi>him,</hi> became a <hi>Pit of Deſtruction</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> and the Kings Eyes were opened to ſee who was his greateſt Friends, and could do no leſs then teſtifie, <hi>That</hi> Daniels <hi>God, was the Lord of Lords, and king of kings, and hath all Power in Heaven and Earth in his Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O therefore Fear and Tremble before the Great God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, whoſe Almighty power is able to daſh you in pieces like a Potters Veſſel, and to caſt you as Dung upon the Face of the Earth, and give your Fleſh to the Fouls of the Air; for aſuredly the God of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and of <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach</hi> and <hi>Abed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nego</hi> is our God, and his Arm is not at all ſhortned, that it cannot Save; nor his Ear heavy, that it cannot Hear; but he will aſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly hear the Cry of the Oppreſſed, and will deliver us in his own appointed time, as he did <hi>Iſrael</hi> of Old; for he is a God hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prayer, and to whom every Knee muſt Bow. O therefore take Warning you Inhabitants of this Nation of <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the day of your Viſitation be quite over; for without ſpeedy Repentance be found in thee, the overflowing Scourge will aſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſs through thee, as it did over <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of Old. For what Sins were there committed in her, that are not found in thee at this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they pleaded highly for the Law and the Prophets, and had the Scriptures of Truth, and ſaid, <hi>Had they been in the dayes of their Fore-Fathers, they would not have killed the Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> yet being ignorant of what the Prophets teſtified of in the Scriptures of Truth concerning Chriſt, they Reviled him, and Deſpiſed him, and put him to Death, notwithſtanding he turned them to the Holy Scriptures, and bid them, <hi>Search them, for they are they</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that teſtifie of me, but you will not come to me that you may have Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and he alſo ſaid, <hi>That he was not come to deſtroy the Law nor the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but to fulfil them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And he was the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs ſake, to all that did believe in him; and to as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

as did believe in his Name in that day, to them he gave Power to become Sons &amp; Daughters of the moſt high God, &amp; eſtabliſhed his ſecond Covenant in them, according to his Promiſe, by <hi>writing his Law in their hearts,</hi> and <hi>putting his Truth in their Inward parts;</hi> and ſo they were no more under the Law, but under Grace, and for this end was the Goſpel Preached, that Sin might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the Fleſh, that we might be juſtified in the Spirit. The Law of the Spirit of Life which Chriſt Jeſus our Lord is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up in the Hearts of his People, is beyond the outward Law; for thereby he purifieth the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and makes it void of <hi>Offence</hi> towards God &amp; Man; &amp; it is beyond the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> (which the <hi>Jews</hi> appeared ſo ſtrickt for) which was Gods <hi>Ordinance</hi> in its time, till Chriſt came (who is full of Grace and Truth) to put an end to Sin, and finiſh Tranſgreſſion, and bring in everlaſting Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and ſet up his everlaſting Government in his People, of which there is to be no end; and thoſe that do live under his Government, can do no leſs then Fear God, and Honour the King; giving unto God that which is his, and to the King that which is his; but as pertaining to the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> it is the King of Heavens Prerogative alone, to ſit upon his <gap reason="illegible: scratched out" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

O therefore you that have any tenderneſs for your own Souls; prize your time, and the day of Gods Love to your Immortal Souls, leſt the Midnight Cry overtake you at unawares, in the Night of Apoſtacy, before you come to own and ſubmit to the Miniſtration of Condemnation againſt Sin, which is glorious in its time, here is the ſtrait and narrow way, that is hard to that Birth that lives in Sin, therefore this is the ſtrait way that Chriſt ſpoke of, that all muſt walk in that come to know the Miniſtration of Juſtification in the ſight of God, which is far more glorious in its time; thoſe who thus come to receive and ſubmit to Gods Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the way that was once ſtrait and narrow, doth become a Path of Pleaſantneſs to them, and all his ways peace to that Birth which Chriſt ſpoke of to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> which is of his own nature; and he that is begotten and brought forth in his Heavenly Divine Nature, as the Scripture ſaith in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin; for his Seed remaineth in him; and he cannot Sin, becauſe he is born of God.</hi> So there is not a good Thought, nor a good Deſire, but what is of the Lords be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting in us; and he that begets theſe good deſires in us, is able to fulfil the deſires of them that fear him, according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the Holy Scriptures of Truth; and thoſe he makes able rather to chuſe, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, to ſuffer Affliction with the People of God, then to enjoy the Pleaſures of Sin which is but for a Seaſon.</p>
            <p>O therefore you Prieſts and People of all ſorts, that are plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Sin term of Life, ſearch the Scriptures, for they are they that teſtifie againſt you, in all your Ungodly Actions; for you are not only under the Condemnation of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but alſo Tranſgreſſors of the Law of Grace, that do live and act in Sin, in Perſecuting your honeſt Neighbours, who for Conſcience ſake cannot bow to the wills of Men, in things relating to Gods Worſhip; for the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was added becauſe of Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for before Sin entred there was no need of an outward Law to puniſh for Sin, but to keep to the Law of the Spirit of Truth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93358:4"/>
within, in which ſtate Man would have been happy had he kept therein; for Chriſt is the Reſurrection and the Life, that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed after the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> that ſhould redeem fallen Man out of that Eſtate into the Reſtoration and Image of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Therefore you that are pleading to be ſaved by Chriſts Death and Sufferings, and yet keep in the Image of the Earthly, and are not come to ſuffer with Chriſt, &amp; to be buried with him in Baptiſm, that you may know the Reſurrection of his Life to raiſe up your Souls that are dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, that you may put off the Old Man with his Deeds, and ſo come to bear the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Heavenly, and ſo live in newneſs of Life, you are but deceiving your own Souls, for the end of Chriſts comeing was, <hi>To Redeem his People out of Sin,</hi> and not to ſave them in their Sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>If you Dye in your Sins, whither I go you cannot come;</hi> for he is of purer Eyes then to behold Iniquity, as to let it go unreproved, or to dwell with Uncleanneſs; (therefore) as the Prophet ſaid, <hi>He was a Man of Sorrow, and acquainted with Grief,</hi> in that prepared Body of which it was ſaid, <hi>He went about doing good, and healing all manner of Diſeaſes,</hi> for them that did believe in him; but where unbelief was, he did not many mighty works there; for there is nothing unpoſſible to thoſe that do believe in his Name.</p>
            <p>O! therefore fear and tremble ye Inhabitants of the Earth, and wait to know the Iudgments of the Lord to be ſet up in you, that you may learn Righteouſneſs through them; for the unlimitted Power of the Lord is going through this Nation, and it is in vain for mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Men, whoſe Breath is in their Noſtrils, to ſet themſelves in battle array againſt the Lamb and his Followers, for the Lamb and his Followers ſhall have the Victory; for he is that great Prophet which <hi>Moſes</hi> Propheſied of, <hi>That ſhould be raiſed up like unto him,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Him ſhall ye hear in all things; and thoſe that will not hear this Prophet, ſhall be cut off from among the People:</hi> For the mighty Power of the Lord is going through this Nation, and the day

            <p>But Ah! you <hi>Prieſts, Rulers</hi> and <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> that are riſen up againſt the People of God in theſe times, how have you appeared againſt the Law and the Goſpel? and by your Fruits you are known to be thoſe that Chriſt ſpoke of to his Diſciples, who ſaid, <hi>By their Fruits ye ſhall know them;</hi> and he alſo bid them, (that had the Everlaſting Goſpel to Preach) <hi>As they had freely received, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give:</hi> but wherein hath your Love appeared to God or to your Neighbours, <hi>To Love the Lord your God with all your Hearts, and with all your Souls, and your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as your ſelves:</hi> On which two great Commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets, which muſt be fulfilled in the Royal Law of Chriſt within; but you have rather appeared like them that came forth out of the City, <hi>Deſireing Chriſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of their Coaſt,</hi> for the loſs of a few Swine, notwithſtanding the great Miracle which he did for their Neighbour, in caſting out <hi>Legions</hi> of Devils that did torment him, and he ſate by Jeſus cloathed, and in his right mind.</p>
            <p>O! therefore bluſh and be aſhamed, you that pretend the Scripture is your only Rule, and live ſo contrary to it; for have you not appeared worſe then thoſe who prayed Chriſt to depart out from their Coaſt, to ſave their outward Subſtance, and would have none of the Knowledge of his ways? for you have rejected and deſpiſed Chriſt in his appearance, who hath waited long to be gracious to your Souls, though he hath knocked ſo long at the door of your Hearts, till his Locks have been wet with the Dew of the Night, and yet you ſtill refuſe him, and the knowledge of his ways, and had rather entertain your <hi>Legion</hi> of Unclean Thoughts and Ungodly Deeds, and have alſo ſaid, <hi>That there is no living without Sin on this ſide the Grave;</hi> and ſo have made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant

with Hell and Death, which muſt be broken, if ever you come to know the travail of your Souls, as <hi>David</hi> did, when he cryed under the ſence of Gods Iudgments for Sin, <hi>That he would give no ſleep to his Eyes, nor ſlumber to his Eye-lids, till he had found a Habitation for the God of</hi> Iacob <hi>to dwell in;</hi> for he muſt have the whole Heart where he takes up his abode, and no room left for Uncleanneſs; O therefore ſearch and ſee, whether you be not worſe then they that deſired Chriſt to depart from them to ſave ſelf, that will give no room for Chriſt in your own Hearts to reign there, nor no room for his Subjects that are under the reign of his Power; though we would eat our own Bread, and wear our own Apparel; but you are taking away our outward Subſtance, which the Lord hath bleſt us with to nouriſh us and our Familys, and taking of us to Priſon, and then come to diſturb us in the Priſon, for no other cauſe but for meeting together in the Name of Jeſus, to worſhip the Father and the Son in the Spirit and in the Truth; and for this cauſe are we put into Priſon; and for the ſame cauſe are we ſtill ſufferers in the Priſon, for <hi>ſeveral times was I pulled out of the Meeting while I was a Priſoner at Bridewel, and kept from the rest of my Friends till the Meeting was done, for no other cauſe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Prayer to the Living God,</hi> before the now Sheriffs came into their places; and ſince they have come in, they have alſo bent their Bow againſt the Righteous, and gone from Priſon to Priſon, to diſturb us in our Spiritual Worſhip in the Priſon, and gave the Keepers Orders, <hi>That we ſhould not be ſuffered to come together to Preach and Pray:</hi> And according to their Orders were we <hi>Lockt aſunder.</hi> But bleſſed be the Name of the Lord, our Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cannot be removed into a Corner, and therefore they cannot ſeperate us from his Preſence, which is life to our Souls; if they put us one by one into a ſtinking Dungeon, there will our God hear our Prayers, and ſend the Angel of his Preſence down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, to ſweeten our Souls with the ſweet Oyntment of his love, as bleſſed be his Name, he did at that time amongſt us; and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93358:6"/>
in the ſenſe of his living Preſence and Power, my Heart and Mouth was opened to <hi>Praiſe the Lord for his Goodneſs and Mercy to our Souls,</hi> and in Prayer, <hi>That he might preſerve us in the living ſence of the ſame to the end of our days, that ſo we might receive the end of our Hope and Faith, even the Salvation of our Souls;</hi> and in the mean time came in Sheriff <hi>Arnold</hi> with others in his Company, who took me off my Knees from Prayer, and ſent me away by his man to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and he and the reſt followed after to diſturb Friends here; and when they came in, they were very fierce to thruſt in through Friends that ſate in the outward roomes, that they might come to the innermoſt room in the Priſon, to ſee if they could find any <hi>Preaching</hi> or <hi>Praying,</hi> but Friends being ſitting in ſilence, they could hear no Words till after they came in; a Friend ſpake to them, <hi>To Fear the Lord, becauſe his Name is Great,</hi> and for theſe words, or ſuch like, was he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be taken away out of his lodging room, (from the reſt of Friends) and put him down into a dark Room, called the <hi>Weſt-houſe;</hi> &amp; they commanded that I ſhould be put from the reſt of Friends alſo, and not be ſuffered to meet with them; &amp; ſo I told them, <hi>They were but Mortal Men, and that the Sword of Mortality hanged over their Heads, which was near ready to cut them down,</hi> and therefore my deſire to them was to <hi>Repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the Turn-key took me down into a place, called <hi>Paules,</hi> and put me into a dark hole; and <hi>Thomas Lugg</hi> an Informer, and now a Conſtable, one of the company that came along with the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, followed after, and ſpoke of <hi>Chaining of me,</hi> &amp; that <hi>I ſhould have neither Bread nor Water,;</hi> and the next Meeting day, being lockt and kept one from another in ſeveral Roomes, I being at <hi>Prayer,</hi> the Goaler and his Man came where I was, and took me off my Knees, and would not ſuffer me to ſtay with the reſt of my Friends that lodged in the ſame dark Room, it being a place where <hi>Felloners</hi> uſe to lodge, and would not ſuffer one Friend
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93358:7"/>
to go along with me, but put me among the <hi>Felloners</hi> and <hi>Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> where I was <hi>Derided</hi> and <hi>ſhamefully Intreated,</hi> and <hi>Water thrown on me,</hi> for no other cauſe but <hi>Praying to the Living God;</hi> and ever ſince I am not ſuffered to ſtay in the Room with my Friends on our Meeting days, but in a little time taken forth and put from the reſt of my Friends, though <hi>Drunkards</hi> and <hi>Swearers</hi> are ſuffered frequently to meet and make themſelves drunk, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being uſed after the manner that we are uſed.</p>
            <p>What is above written, is not written boaſtingly, or to exalt ſelf, but that all may know our Innocency, and the true cauſe wherefore and by whom we ſuffer; and it is great pitty that Men Profeſſing Religion, ſhould bring forth no better Fruites, which is no way inducing to any ſober People, who have any regard to Gods Honour, or the good of their own Souls, to come to be of their Religion, the thing that they in words ſo much preſs for. And bleſſed be the Name of the Lord, we have no cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that our ſufferings are too hard for the Teſtimony of Jeſus, who ſuffered Death for us; neither have we any thing to glory in, but in the Lord Jeſus, that is giving us ſtrength in weakneſs; for of our ſelves we have nothing to glory in, but our Infirmities; but glory be to his Name for Evermore, that is redeeming of us out of Imperfection, and making our Hearts ſound in his Statutes, who works in us, both to will and to do of his own good Pleaſure, and ſo let his own works live to praiſe him, ſaith my Soul, forever and for evermore; for it is by Grace we ſtand, and not by any works of ours; but that Faith that doth not bring forth good works is a dead Faith, and is not the Faith which the Iuſt lives by, which ſtands in the Power of God, Oh! therefore conſider before it be too late, ye <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> of the People, what Fruites there are brought forth in this Nation, that <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Praying</hi> to the Living God is become a Crime in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and haſten to put a ſtop to this great Current of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that is running down the Streets like a mighty Stream; for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93358:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Determination of <hi>Iſraels</hi> God is to Humble this Nation, and to thinn the Land of Evil-doers; and thoſe that will not bring their works before death to Iudgment, the Lord will ſend forth his Deſtroying Angel, to cut them down by Mortality; for as ſure as he did ſend forth his Angel in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to mark all that Mourn &amp; Sigh for the Abominations of the times; ſo is the Angel of his Preſence ſent forth this day to mark all the Upright Heatt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that our Souls may reſt in the day of Trouble, that is coming upon the Wicked, that will not come to ſee Sin to be exceeding Sinful, and ſo come to cry out under the Body of Sin and Death, as the Apoſtle once did in the ſenſe of his wretchedneſs, till he came to witneſs Victory through Chriſt Ieſus his Lord, and a reſting place in him for his Soul; for as to an outward Callamity, the Lord may ſuffer the Righteous to pertake with the Wicked, the Miraculous Works of God in this day are inward, an Inward Change and a through Tranſlation out of the Kingdom of Satan, into the Kingdom of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt within; for the King of Heaven ſuffereth Violence in and until the Violent <gap reason="illegible: scratched out" resp="#APEX" extent="3 words">

            <p>O! you that are gazing after Chriſt and his Miracles, in the outward Obſervations, like unto the Wiſe Profeſſing <hi>Jews,</hi> notwithſtanding they had ſeen many Miracles that Ieſus had done, yet nothing would ſerve them but their own Wills, <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out he would come down from the Croſs, they would not believe in him;</hi> and many Miracles have been wrought by Chriſt in this day, not only among the mean ones, but alſo ſome among the great and mighty of the Earth that have believed on him, and have parted with their <hi>Legions</hi> of Unclean Thoughts and Actions to entertain Chriſt, and when this through Change hath been made, your Viſible Eyes have beheld, that they have lived in Newneſs of Life outwardly alſo, and yet you will not underſtand that Scripture, <hi>John</hi> 14. 12. where Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Verily, Verily, I ſay unto you, he that believeth on me, the werkes that I do, ſhall he</hi>

whereby they underſtand the Scriptures of Truth, and cauſes the dead to hear his Voice and live.</p>
            <p>Oh! therefore my counſel is unto you, both Profeſſor and Prophane, that you do not trifle away your pretious time, to ſit under the Miniſtry of the Idol Shepherds this day, which do feed you with a Form of Words without the Power; for the Book is Sealed to the Learned and Unlearned, till the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> open the Book, and unlooſe the Seals. Oh! therefore hearken no more to the corrupt teachings of Men, who have gotten the words of the Prophets, Chriſt and his Apoſtles, but are ignorant of the Power that preſerves from Sin, and ſpeaketh, (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> whereas the Lord hath not ſpoken unto them, therefore they do not profit the People at all, for they have nothing to do to take the Name of the Lord in their Mouths, who do hate to be reformed in themſelves; for what were they the better that went to deck themſelves with the Apoſtles words, and ſpake the ſame words as they did, in the Name of Jeſus, (ſaying) <hi>We abjure you to come out of the Man;</hi> but the Devils would not be ſubject unto them, becauſe they wanted the Power; but ſaid unto them, <hi>Jeſus we know, and</hi> Paul <hi>we know, but who are ye?</hi> and ſo run upon them and wounded them: And therefore let every one that nameth the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> depart from Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>That there is none can call Jeſus, Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and the Lord ſaid by the mouth of his Prophet to Rebellious <hi>Iſrael, That though they ſaid the Lord liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, yet they Swore falſly,</hi> becauſe they did not witneſs him to be their Redeemer to live in them. Oh! therefore be awakened to Righteouſneſs you Profeſſors of all ſorts, and ſit no longer under this dead Miniſtry, that ſtands only in a Form of words, without the Power; for the Kingdom of God is come in Power, &amp; there is room enough for all that do follow Chriſt in the Regeneration, in inward Tribulation; and thoſe that have paſſed through this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Tribulation, have no cauſe to fear the Outward Sufferings,
