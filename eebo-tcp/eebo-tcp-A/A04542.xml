            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Christ our Lord.</head>
            <p>GReat strife there is at this day, about the ministery of the Church of England, vvhether
it be the same that Christ hath ordeyned in his Testament, or an other. And many by
conference, some also by vvriting, have controverted this question. There coming to
my hands, these tvvo Letters follovving, the one vvritten in defence of the said ministerie,
the other as aunsvver therto, and disproving the same: I have thought them meet and needfull
to be published for thy good (gentle reader) that the truth in this point may appeare. Neyther
will they that vvrote these thinges, blame me for thus doing (I trust), seing the matter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

dovvne that vvhich they are persvvaded is the truth, and vvhich they vvould vvish others vvith
them to receyve and follovv: 3. and sundry copies [especially of the first letter] are already
spred abroad in vvriting vnto the handes of many.</p>
            <p>The ground and occasion of these letters (as I vnderstand and as may be perceived also
by the vvritinges themselves) vvas this. The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vvould not ioyne vvith the publick ministerie of England in the vvorship of God. She being
much sollicited to the contrarie, gave in vvriting, a reason of that her faith and practise, to
one Mr A: H. a minister, and a man very learned. The reason vvas this (as may also be seen

               </gap>
is evident by theyr present estate: and by these reasons follovving.</p>
            <p>First, if all the false ministery, worship, and tyranny of Antichrist wers
in all other places of the world abolished, yet so long as this Prelacy and
other Clergy and worship aforesaid remayneth in this land, Antichrist that
<pb facs="tcp:17773:5"/>
sonne of perdition were not vtterly consumed: As the Scripture testifyeth
he shalbe by the light of the Gospell before Christs comming at the great day.
2 <hi>Thes. 2. 3. 8. vvith Rev. 14. 6. 7. 8. and 18. 19. and Ierem. 50. and 51. cap.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the Churches of Antichrist cannot be compleet in all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall
functions, Prelacy, and Ministery of Antichrist, if they have
not the functions, Prelacy, and Ministery of Archbishops, Lordbishops,
Archdeacons, Priests, and the rest now had and retayned in the Land.
<hi>This is proved by the Popes Canons and Pontificall, and by theyr Church
constitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Churches of Christ may be compleet in the whole ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
worship, and government appoynted by Christ to his Church, and yet
be alway and altogether without the present ministery, worship, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment
by Archbshops, Lordbishops, Archdeacons, Priests etc. now
had and retayned in this Land. <hi>This is proved by the constitution of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue
Churches planted by the Apostles:</hi> Which (the Scripture showeth) we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
compleet in the former, and yet never had nor knew these latter. <hi>Rom. 12.
7. 8. Ephes. 4. 11. 12. 13. Act. 14. 23. and 20. 17. 28. 1. Cor. 12. 28. Col. 2. 5. Phil. 1.
1. Tit. 1. 5—9. 1 Tim. 3. and 5. cap. and 6. 13. 14. 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 1. 2. 3. 4. 12.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if that which is had in this Land were the true Ministery,
worship, and government ordeyned by Christ in his Church, then ought
all the Churches of Christ vpon earth to vse the same <hi>(Mat. 28. 18. 19. 20.
1 Tim. 6. 13. 14. 1 Cor. 4. 17. and 12. 5. and 14. 37. Iude. ver. 3. Rev. 22. 16. 17.
18. 19.):</hi> But even the Prelates themselves and theyr Proctors confesse
it is and may be otherwise. <hi>VVhitg. in the preface of his last book against

            <p>Finally, if that which is had in this Land were the true Ministery,
worship, and government appoynted by Christ to his Church, then might
it be found in the word of God: But that can it not. If any be otherwise
mynded, let them show the severall offices, entrance, administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and maintenance of the Prelacy and other Ministery of these assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyes
out of the Scriptures and Testament of Christ.</p>
            <p>If they speak not according to this vvord, it is because
there is no light in them.

SECTION. 1.</head>
               <p>Grace and peace be with you in Iesus Christ
I haue receyued and read the letter, sent vnto you by
Mr. H. (as I vnderstand:) which you and others
entreat me to aunswer. Very vnwilling I am here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
in divers respects: And were it not for the truths sake
(which is called into question) I should not by any meanes
be drawen to write agaynst any, least off all against him who
I vnderstood wrote this letter vnto you. For howsoeuer in
these controversies of religion we do in iudgment or practise
differ one from another, yet for the knowledg I haue of him,
and the good gifts God hath given him, I do and shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
love him in the Lord. Yet notwithstanding seyng by
this letter the truth of Christ is obscured and oppugned, seing
also by this meanes you and others might be seduced into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and fall from your own stedfastnes: I durst not in this
case be wanting eyther to the defence off Christs truth, or to
the strengthning off you and others thereyn, to the uttermost
off my power: Specially vnderstanding that divers copyes
of this letter are spread abroad to the hurt of many: and being
also earnestly requested to aunswer it, not by you onely, but
by divers others whom in this case I could not well deny.
Besides that myne own present estate doth not a litle vrge me
hereunto for the clearing of my self, who for this truth have
now a long tyme suffred trouble, as an evill doer, euen vnto
bonds: <hi>But the word of God is not bound.</hi> For these cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
haue I ben drawen to answer this writing: hoping that
the truth will manifest and approue it self in the conscience of
every godly one. And of Mr. H. who wrote this letter, I
haue this hope more specially, for the good things I know to
be in him: howsoever he have ben overtaken thus to write
against the truth, as my self also hertofore in ignorance have
ben an adversary vnto it. But God had mercy on me: as I
trust he will also on him and many other yet otherwise myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
To God the Father of mercyes be prayse for ever.</p>
               <p>

In this hope I will nou proceed by the helpe of God to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
aunswer to this letter: And first to the entrance of it,
then to the rest thereof. Concernig the entrance of it, these few
things onely will I note. First that if Mr. H. had duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered

immediately following in this place (where it is further said,
<hi>And be ye doers of the word, and not heates onely deceyving
your own selues):</hi> He would I hope neyther have condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the innocent, even you for your obedience of Christ and his
word, neyther haue suffred his pen by misalledging the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
thus to labor your with drawing from the obedience of
faith. But he would rather haue seen and acknowledged that
in theyr Church estate compared with the ordinance of Christ
they neyther are doers of the word, but deceyvers of themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues:
neyther do themselues lay aside the filthynes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

to save theyr soules: but are in deed become the enemyes and
persecuters of the truth, and that in great wrath and subtilty:
howsoever in word they professe otherwise, as do even the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atest

               <p>Secondly for yourself, well may you think, as we all ought,
that it is no disgrace vnto vs, that our knowledg is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and our judgment weak: seing the Apostle saith even off

that <hi>the written word of God onely is to be the rule of our Life

               </p>
               <p>Lastly, concerning Mr. H. who wrote this letter vnto
you, as you shall do well to take it that he erreth of ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
and not of malice, etc. as he desireth to be taken: so of him
I would desier, for the taking away of this vayle from his ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
that he do heedfully look into the perfitt law of liberty: not
onely the better to see the filthynes of theyr corruptions that
he may avoyd them, but to behold also what orders and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Christ Iesus hath sett in his Church, to keep and observ
them. To which end he shall do well himself to Consider that
which here he hath sett down vnto you, concerning the writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
word of God. According to which if he shall examine the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of theyr Church-constitution (of which more, God
willing, hereafter): I hope he will no more say in this case,
that as of syncerity, as of God, in the sight of God, so writeth
he of these things: but will rather acknowledg that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
go about to bring colour out of the Scriptures for them,
they do therein no other but<note n="f" place="margin">2. Cor. 2. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>make marchandize of the word
of God:</hi> And therefore will eyther stay his tal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, and lay his
hand on his mouth: or if he speak, will speak to his own sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<note n="g" place="margin">Iudg. 6. 31.</note> say, <hi>Wilt thou plead Antichrists cause<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or wilt thou save
him? If he be of Christ, let him plead for himself, against them
that by the word of theyr testimony destroy his ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces.</hi> Thus
much to the entrance of this letter.</p>
               <p>The rest of it is spent in laboring to disprove the writing
which it seemeth you gaue him in defence of your separation
from the ministery of these assemblyes. Which after he hath
well propounded in forme of reasoning, he then bringeth some
show of answer therevnto and of defence of theyr Ministery.
Wherein although I might in few lynes shortly have noted
the subtilty and vnsoundnes of his answers yet have I chosen
rather to write somewhat largely, both for your sake and his
own, and for others also into whose hands these writings
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17773:8"/>
may co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. And this haue I thought to be the more needfull,
because he doth here so earnestly both protest the syncerity of
his affection, and make promise that nothing shalbe brought
to perswade you, but the word of God. Now of the syncerity
of his affection I make no doubt, but do vertly thinck that
he writeth and walketh as he is perswaded. Onely where he
promiseth and pretendeth to bring the word of God for the
perswasion of your soule, and performeth it not in deed: and
yet hath such obiections and pretence off Scripture and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as greater in this case (I thinck) neyther have ben ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can well be brought: there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ore have I thought it best, for
better clearing of the truth, to prosecute his annswers from
poynt to poyut: And although it wil be the more tedious, yet
to take this course therein: first, to sett down in his own
words his aunswers to the reason you gaue him: and then to
examine and take them away by the light of the Scriptures.
For your self, it shalbe your part (as he desireth you) to lay
apart all sinister affection, and with meeknes to receyv the
word of truth grafted in you, and able to save your soule. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
therefore well what is said: and the Lord give you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
in all things. Now to proceed, it followeth in his
letter to you, thus.</p>

               <head>Answer to the 2. Section.</head>
               <p>MAyster H. sayth here, he is not vnwilling to yeeld to the
first part of the reason: Yet afterward in his letter when
he hath taken some exception agaynst the prooff off it,
contradicting himselff, he<note n="a" place="margin">In sectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 5. in the end of it.</note> hath these words, <hi>And this I hope
may be sufficient to show how vntrue that is which is affirmed
in the first part of the reason, &amp;c.</hi> Now to yeeld to the first part
of the reason (as being true) and to hold that which is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in it to be vntrue, what are these but contradictary the
one to the other? But to let this passe, because it may be I mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
his meaning, or he forgott himselff: I com to show
that the words off the Apostle written 2. <hi>Thes. 2. 4. &amp;c.</hi> do fitly
and directly proue the first part off the reason, and therefore
are not for the proof thereof wrested and perverted from the
right sence, as he taketh exception. I prove it thus first.</p>
               <p>If this<note n="b" place="margin">2. Thes. 2. 4. &amp;c.</note> Scripture teach that such as receyv or ioyne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Antichrist that man of sinne in his apostasy, opposition,
and exaltation above all that is called God and that is holy,
that such (I say) shall perish because they receyv not the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
off the truth, but are caryed with a strong delusion to beleev
lies and to please themselues in that transgression of the lawes
and ordinances off God: then it proueth that the people off
God may not receyv or ioyne vnto any which deale with the
holy things off God a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d work vpon mens co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sciences by vertue
off any off that Antichrists power, offices, and callings: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in so doyng they cannot but haue fellowship in that apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasy,
opposition, and exaltation off Antichrist, and thereby
stand subiect to perish eternally, forasmuch as they receyv
not the loue off the truth, but in a strong delusion please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in vntruth and vnrighteousnes, even in Antichrists tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression

               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:17773:9"/>
But the former is true: as may appeare by comparing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
vers. 3. 4. 7. 8. with vers. 10. 11. 12. Therefore also the
latter.</p>
               <p>Next for proof hereoff, let us marke how the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth
Antichrist in this Scripture. Which we fynd to be by
many mo effects and propertyes then Mr. H. hath noted: and
such also, as do plainely show that this Scripture proveth
the truth of the first part of the reason for which it is alledged:</p>
               <p>1. As first, that Antichrist shall make<note n="l" place="margin">2. Thes. 2. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Apostasy</hi> and
departure from the faith and order off Iesus Christ prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to his Church. Which whether he haue not done it in the
offices of ministery, in the entrance into them, in the works
and maintenance off them, aswell as in other poynts off the
faith and commaundements of Christ, let the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
speak.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, that he shall be<note n="m" place="margin">Vers. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>a man of sinne.</hi> Where
it is to be obserued, that as the true Church of Christ is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to the body of a man, and together with Christ the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad

the false Church of Antechrist is compared also to the body of
a man, and consisting of all the parts together is called <hi>a man

seen, so also in the offices and functions of that body of Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
that man of sinne.</p>

lyes</hi> should count to be lawfull, as they do even vnto this
day?</p>
               <p>But to let other reasons alone, and to take the marks of
Antichrist, which Mr. H. hath himself here set down. I would
aske, first how Antichrist shall teach his false doctrine (which
here Mr. H. noteth to be one marke): whether in the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
offices and callings ordeyned by Christ, or in the vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
offices and callings devised by Sathan and vsed by this
man of sinne in his Apostasy? Secondly, how he shall vsurpe
that authority, to give lawes vnto mens consciences, and to
rule in the hearts of men as God (which Mr. H. noteth as the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:17773:10"/>
other marke): whether in the true offices and callings ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
by Christ, or in false ones devised by Sathan a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?
For the very termes and actions of <hi>teaching</hi> and of <hi>vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
authority,</hi> here mentioned by Mr. H. do in this case im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
some offices and callings, lawfull or vnlawfull, wherein
to teach and vsurpe authority. Now lawfull they can not be,
because he standeth in apostasy from Christs way, yea oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitt
against it, and even lawles in that respect. It remayneth
therefore that they are vnlawfull ones. And being found not
one lyin the papacy, but in the Church of England: it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
that they are not to be receyved or ioyned vnto in the one
any more then in the other: as also that this Scripture is not
wres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

part of the reason.</p>
               <p>But because Mr. H. taketh exception at the proof, though
all in vayne: yet for his better satisfaction, and more strenght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the proposition, let him further consider, first, that
as Christ being king and Lord of his Church, hath given
vnto it the holy things of his word, Sacraments, Censures,
Treasury etc. so he hath also as<note n="z" place="margin">1. Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as he doth whensoever we suffer them to be wrought vpon in
the ministery of the word or any other wayes, by vertue of
any Antichristian power office or calling. And this I thought
to annexe for the further confirmation of the first part of the
reason: which though in word Mr. H. seemeth to graunt, yet
in deed he laboreth to oppugne.</p>

the Papists, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d prove them to bend true Church though they
professe in word that Christ is the king of his Church, becouse
in deed they obey not his lawes, but have invented and use
theyr own canons and constitutions for government of the

in heaven and in earth: But in deed it appeareth they do exile
and banish him out of his kingdome, or at least leav him but a
small portion or rather none at all. For in respect that he is a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
king and the king of his Church, he is also (as Iames<note n="o" place="margin">I am. 4. 12.</note>
speaketh) the onely lavvgi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

abide. For they adde their popish Canous, constitutions, and
customes, vvhereby they vvill haue, the Church governed: Yea,
they vvill haue these take place, though they utterly displace the
vvord of God for the maintenance of them. <hi>These are theyr

whether these (I say) can be said in truth to hold Christ

               </p>
               <p>In the last place Mr. H. addeth, that <hi>nothing among

the word and law of God.</hi> To which I aunswer, first, that
if this were true, yet it is not to the purpose seing many things
among them contrary to the word of God are vrged to be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
vpon payne of imprisonment, confiscation of Goods and
lands, banishment, death, and such like. Secondly, I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
that they do require men to be subiect to theyr excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication

in theyr writs of excommunication do show. Now it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and confessed by the best of themselves, that they have not
Christs power to excommunicate, but execute it contrary to
the word of God, by an Archdeacon or Lordly Prelate, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

it followeth, that they are not a true Church of Christ. For

Whereas these assenblyes have no other power
to excommunicate, but by the Archdeacon or Lordbischop,
whose offices be Antichristian. And herevpon it is, that the
more religious any is among them, the more he contemneth
theyr excommunication: Which were a fearefull sinne, if theyr
Church were a true Church, whose bynding on earth were
such as bound also in heaven. Thirdly, I aunswer, if theyr
ministery and worship of God were according to the word a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

the discipline of his Church and the outvvard calling of the ministers, is no such

               <p>IT is to be noted here, first that Mr. H. denyeth not but they
stand in grievous sinne, by neglecting Christs ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
that he graunteth they retayne divers corruptions in
theyr Church, which were derived to them from the Papists.
How theyr case standing thus by his own confession, how can
he peswade you or any other to<note n="v" place="margin">Rev. 18. 4. and 14. 9. 20.</note> partake with them in such
sinnes, vnles he would have you also to receiv of theyr plag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</p>
               <p>Agayn it is to be observed, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r. H. faith here, he will
not take vpon him to defend the least of theyr popish corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
And yet doth cleane otherwise throughout this letter,
chiefly in his aunswer to the second part of the reason. But to
omitt this, I would desier to have noted down in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
the corruptions remayning in theyr Church, which
he confesseth were derived to them from the Papists.
And then, let it be iudged whether they be Antichristian.</p>
               <p>Here also it is to be mynded, that the ministery and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17773:15"/>
constitution of theyr Church is not charged to be Antichris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
because of this, that they want or neglect some of

day.</p>
               <p>Next towching theyr <hi>profession</hi> he speaketh of, I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
first, that the verball profession of the articles of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
that are fundamentall, will no more help them then it
doth the Papists: who do also verbally and daily repeat and
professe in generall the articles of faith, called the Apostles
treed, and the Creed of Athanasius, of Nice, and Calcedon:
wherein are briefly and generally conteyned the fudamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
poynts of Christian religion. But what avayleth this ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the one or the other, when otherwise in particular, all
of them in practise, and some in judgment deny Christ to be
that eternall Prophet, Priest, and king of his Church, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
in word and generall they both do professe it.</p>
               <p>Secondly I aunswer, that the very strength of delusion, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
depth of the subtilty of Antichrist (by which he deceyveth) sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in this, that he pretendeth to be for a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with Christ, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
many excele<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t truths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> otherwise he would soone be espyed
and forsaken: whereas now it is a mystery (as the Scripture
<note n="a" place="margin">2. Thes. 2. 7. Rev. 17. 5.</note> saith) hardly discerned, and hardlyer avoyded. Hereupon it
is that among the Papists, so many of them are deluded, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>
the Pope professeth he is not against Christ, but for him,

even his vica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Catholik Church, out of which there is no salvation, and such
like. And among these in England likewise, whiles theyr mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
pretend to be the ministers of Christ, and professe to
bring his Gospell with them: when as in deed they revile
and persecute the true and sy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cexe practise of it even vnto
death.</p>
               <p>Thirdly I aske, whether the ministery worship and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
appoynted by Christ for his Church vnder the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
be not asmuch of the foundation, as the ministery, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and government appoynted by Moses for the tyme of
the law? And if they be, whether they are not as faithfully sett
down by Christ as the other were by Moses, and as carefully
to be observed by vs, as the other were by the Iewes: or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
much more, in asmuch as<note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 3 1 2. 3.</note> Christ the Sonne is

               <p>Fourthly I aske, what fundamentall articles of religion
Moses and Aar on with the rest of the Iewes ioyning with
them held, that<note n="c" place="margin">Num. 16. 1. 2. 3. &amp;c.</note> Corah, Dathan, Abiram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

rammes; whereas disobedience and rebellion against the,
commaundements of God is as the sinne of witchcraft, vnder
what pretence soever it be, and transgression is wickednes and
Idolatry, how lightly soever men account thereof.</p>
               <p>Fifthly whereas Mr H. saith <hi>there is no Antichrist who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
Doctrine is sound:</hi> I willingly graunt it, and have already
showed their case to be such. Yet with all I wish Mr H.
to marke, that even Antichrist that man of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inne professeth
many notable truths and foundamentall articles of religion,
as that there is a God, one in essence, three in persons, the
Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost: that Christ is God and
Man, Prophet, Priest, and king of his Church: that the
holy Ghost is present with the Church of Christ to the end of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17773:16"/>
the world: that there shall be a resurectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of iust and vniust, etc.
And yet notwithstanding standeth he with all his followers
in defection from the truth and obedience of Christ, even to
destruction. By all which is manifest, that the verball pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
helpeth litle, when men in practise and particulars
deny that, which inword in generall they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to hold, and

                  </gap>ive the world, as if they held the truth, when
indeed they fight against it.</p>
               <p>Finally therefore on the one hand vnderstanding by the
<hi>Discipline of the Church</hi> (as we ought) the auncyent and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
order and ordinances, which Christ Iesus by his last Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament
hath given to his Church, for the administration of
his holy things, and for the keeping of his people in the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of faith: and considering on the other hand, that<note n="h" place="margin">2 The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> 2. 3. 4. Rev. 17. 4. 5.</note>
Antichrist hath perverted that holy order, and made <hi>apostasy</hi>
from those holy lawes, advauncing himself and his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
above them, and that also in the ministery, worship
and government of the Church, aswell as in other parts the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof:
it doth and must needs follow herevpon, that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
do not onely not keep that holy order and appointement
of Christ, but also bow down to the confusion and false Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
of Antichrist, they stand in Antichrian estate, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any truths they teach, professe, or mainteyne. So as
then the Ministery of the Church of England being never or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned
by Christ, but derived from Antichrist that man of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it helps them not in this behalf, that they teach and
receiv much truth therein: as we see it helpeth not the papists,
that theyr priests teach, there is a God, a Christ an holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
&amp; Church, a resurrection, and many other fundamentall
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of Christian religion, as before hath ben said.</p>
               <p>But now let vs come to examine, whether in the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
here alledged by Mr H. Antichrist be not described to be
against Iesus Christ, even in that which they call the discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
of the Church, as in other things also agreing to them in
theyr estate. The first Scripture he alledgeth, is out of the
<note n="i" place="margin">Dan. 7. 8 25.</note> prophecy of Daniel. The words are these:
<q>
                     <p>I considered the hornes, and behold, another home,
a litle one, came vp among them, and three of the first
hornes were pluckt away before it. And loe, eyes like the
eyes of a man were in that home, and a mouth speaking
presumptuous things,</p>
                     <bibl> Dan. 7. 8.</bibl>

                        <pb facs="tcp:17773:17"/>
And he shall speak words against the most High,
and consume the Saints of the most High, and think to

                     <bibl>Dan.
7. 25.</bibl>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now although this Scripture seem first to be vnderstood
of Antiochus Ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hanes, and of his pride and tyranny against
the truth and people of God: yet may it also fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly be applyed
further and compared with the description of the beast in the
<note n="k" place="margin">Rev. 13. Cap. and 9. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11.</note> Revelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and so with the Antichristian prelacy and pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

from tyme to tyme. For (to omitt other things that
might here be observed, and to note onely such things as art
most evident) we see here that horne of the beast described to
have eyes like <hi>the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
things.</hi> Even so the ministers of Antichrist (who will
needs be the eyes of the people and light of the world) pretend
to be the ministers of Christ: and not that onely, but haue also
(aswell as that horne) a mouth speaking presumptuous
things, even against the most High. See it in these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
following, and such like which are rise among
them: that the true ministery and syncere practise of the
Gospell of Christ, is schisme, heresy, fancy, rebellion,
insurrection, sedition, subversion of the State, and what
not? that Christ the Sonne hath ben lesse faithfull then
Moses the servant, in setting down any prescript ministery
and order for the Church vnder the Gospell perpetually to be
kept: that Christ who hath all power i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

discipline which he hath given to his Church, if Princes on
earth forbid or refuse to establish it: that the ministery of
Antichrist is to be receyved and ioyned vnto, being appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Christian Princes for the service of God: that it is
lawfull for others to be Archbishops and Lordbishops over
the Church and ministers of the Gospell, besides Iesus
Christ: that a priesthood, a stinted number of words and
prayers, tithes, and such like are appointed for the minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
of the Gospell of Christ: that Christ shall not reigne over
them by his offices and ordinances prescribed in his word:
that Christ in his soule went down into hell, whiles his

driving them into banishment, and infinite such cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mityes?

Here we see it was foretold, first that Antichrist <hi>should
make departure from the faith.</hi> Which bring done by him
aswell in the ministery and worship appoynted by Christ, as
in other poynts and doctrines of the Gospell: it can not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded,
but that the ministery and worship of these assembly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
being derived from that <hi>apostasy,</hi> they are also within com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of this Scripture, notwithstanding they teach and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
many excellent poynts of the faith, as do also the Papists
themselves not a few.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it was foretold, that the followers of Antichrist
should <hi>give heed to spirits of errour and Doctrines of divels, and
speak lyes through hypocrisy having theyr consciences feared

               <p>Thirdly, it is here foretold, that Antichrist and his follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
should <hi>forbid mariage, and meats:</hi> towching which, two
this onely will I say at this tyme. For the first, that as it
excuseth not the Papists from being deciphered in this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
because they suffer mariage to the lay people (as they
call them) when as they forbid it to theyr priests: so it will
but litle a vayle these, that they permitt it to their ministers,
and yet forbid it to fellowes of Colledges in the universityes,
and to others mo among them. Besides that they forbid it
to all peole whatsoever in Lent. Rogation week, and such li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
popish seasons: And when they do permitt it, suffer
it onely to be solemnized by a priest, and according to theyr
book: Which is meerly popish and never appoynted by God.
For the second, that is, the forbidding of meats, let them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
well with themselves theyr absteyning from flesch on
Saints eves, Ember dayes, Fridayes and Saterdayes,
more then vpon of her dayes, and in Lent more then other sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the yeare: let them (I say) consider these things wel
and see whether they more agree with the rule of the Apostle
here set down, or with the defection of Antichrist here foretold.</p>

in the fourth chapter, as is here noted down. Where
the Apostle teacheth vs to trye and know the spirits of all men
by the confession they make concerning Christ: to witt, by
theyr acknowledging or derogating from his person, or office.
For vnto these two heads he bringeth the whole matter, the
one concerning the person, the other concerning the office of
the Lord Iesus. Towching his person, that he is God and
Man in one and the same person. His Godhead he noteth
out in these words <hi>[Iesus Christ is come]</hi> to witt, the Sonne of
God from heaven: his manhood in those words <hi>[in the
flesh]:</hi> the vniting and knitting together of these two natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res

Christ, he saith, <hi>he is come in the flesh.</hi>

of these Scriptures, and deciding of the controversy between
vs and these assemblyes. And this to be the true meaning of
these Scriptures, appeareth not onely by the Argument and
circumstances of the places themselues, but also by the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of other Scriptures here quoted in the margent, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
such like in the Book of God. Now before I proceed to
any further application of them, let me here again call to
powr mynd that which hath before ben noted, that even the
Papists themselves (whom these men acknowledg to be of
Antichrist) affirme in generall words and will dy in it against
the Iewes and Turks, that <hi>Iesus Christ is come in the flesh,
the Prophet, Priest, and king of his Church.</hi> Yet will not
Mr. H. or any of good knowledg say to the contrary, but the
Papists notwithstanding are by these Scriptures convinced
to be of Antichrist, because that although they professe thus
much in generall termes, yet when as theyr estate and practise
is examined by the Scriptures in particular, they are found
to professe that in word which in truth and in deed they do not
acknowledg. And why then may not we so reason from these
Scriptures agaynst these assemblyes, which in theyr consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
and practise do likewise in deed deny that in particular,
which in generall they do professe concerning Christs prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
priesthood, and Kingdome? Mr. Beza in his notes
<note n="n" place="margin">Beza his notes vpon 1 Ioh. 4. 2. 3. and vpon 1 Ioh. 2. 22. and 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Ioh. 7.</note> vpon these Scriptures, sayth thus, <hi>The Apostle here
giveth a sure and perpetuall rule to discerne Antichrists and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian
Doctrine by, to vvitt, if the diuine or humane natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
of Christ or the true vnitiug of them together be denyed, or
if never so litle be derogated from the office of that our everlas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
high Priest, Prophet, and King.</hi> Math this well. Thus
doth Mr. Beza vnderstand these Scriptures: and thus he
gathereth from them: as you may see in his notes vpon the
new Testament which are printed in English. And these
Scriptures themselues we see do not poynt at the Papists a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
as if they onely were culpable herein: but they concerne
all others whosoever they be that come within compasse of
these rules. Now to show in particulars how the Papists
offend in this behalf, denying that in deed concerning Christ,
which in word they do acknowledg, is altogether needles at
this tyme: it being graunted on both parts, I meane, both
of vs and of them which yet stand in these assemblyes. It
shalbe sufficient therefore to show that these assemblyes of
England (as now they stand) do not in this theyr constitution
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17773:20"/>
of Church ministery, worship, and order receyv and obey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Iesus Christ in his own ordinance, as theyr <hi>Prophet, Priest,
and King:</hi> And therefore howsoever in word generally they
professe, yet in truth do not in this theyr constitution acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<hi>Iesus Christ come in the flesh:</hi> And consequently (by the
rule and sentence of the Apostle in these Scriptures) are not
of God, but of Antichrist.</p>
               <p>First therefore concerning <hi>Christs Prophecey,</hi> that they do
not receyv and hearken vnto him in his own ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as their
Prophett, is to lamentably evident by this, that they do not
receyv and submitt vnto that ecclesiasticall order, ministery,
and government, which Christ Iesus that Prophet of his
Church hath revealed from God the Father in his word, and
prescribed to his Church to be kept to the end of the world.
This I show two wayes: First, by theyr Church consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution:
then by theyr own confession.</p>

               <p>Here also would I aske Mr H. whether one being in no
office of ministery, yet taking vpon him publikly to teach, and
(as here he saith) leading in at the doore, that is, teaching no
other meanes of salvation but Christ onely who is the doore
of the sheep: whether such a one (I say) were therefore to be
reputed a Pastour and, minister of Christ, lawfully sett
in that office? I am assured Mr H. will not say it. For
that were both to give allowance of intrusion, which Christ

                  </gap>ondemneth: and to open a doore to the annihilating of that
order with Christ hath appoynted his Church for the entran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te

to be accounted in such office of ministery, much lesse will
such teaching approve him that standeth in an Antichristian
office, to be a Pastor or Minister of Iesus Christ.</p>

                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:17773:26"/>
It may also further be observed, that Christ in this<note n="vv" place="margin">Ioh. 10. 2.</note>
Scripture speaketh of such as be <hi>shepeards of sheep:</hi> and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore
that it helpeth not the ministers of these assemblies, who
commonly stand heards of swyne, theyr Church being an
hold of all foule spirits, and a cage of every vncleane and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
bird. Besides that they all, even the most religious
among them, so long as they continew members of that
Church, stand subiect to theyr ecclesiasticall courts, officers
canons, worship, and the rest of theyr abominations,
and therefore as yet in that respect can not be accounted the
sheep of Christ, hearing his voyce and obeying his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</p>
               <p>The next and last Scripture here alledged is out of the
<note n="x" place="margin">Mat. 16. 18.</note> 16. of Mathew. Where Christ as king his Disciples whom
they said he was: Peter aunswered, <hi>Thou art the Christ, the
Sonne of the living God.</hi> Wherevpon Christ said agayn,
<q>
                     <p>I say vnto thee, that thou art Peter, and vpon this

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Here we are taught vpon what rock the true Church
and lively members thereof are built, to witt, vpon this
confession, that <hi>Iesus is the Christ the Sonne of the living
God.</hi> Now here we are to remember that Christ is described
both by his person, and office. Of which I have spoken

I will further note: that as we learned out of Ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e it from the false Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
of Antichrist: that is, by considering whether it be
built vpon the rock Iesus Christ, that Propher, Priest,
and king of his Church. For (as the Apostle<note n="z" place="margin">1 Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>other foundation can no man lay, then that vvhich is layd,
vvhich is Iesus Christ.</hi> But as before we showed, so he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
we are to remember, that a verball and generall profession
of Christ in word being denyed in practise, will not avayle
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17773:26"/>
to make eyther the popish or these assemblyes the true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of God, and not the apostate Synagogues of the man
of sinne.</p>
               <p>The Apostle Peter (to whom with the other disciples
this was spoken, although in the maner of speach Christ
alluded to Peters name, as signifying a stone or rock) he
laying this foundation in the Churches which he planted,
<hi>Iesus Christ, that chief corner stone, elect and precious,</hi> doth
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 6. 7. 8.</note> thus further apply it vnto them, saying, <hi>Vnto you which
beleev it is precious: but vnto them that be disobedient, the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
which the builders disallowed, the same is become the head
of the corner: and a stone to stumble at, and a rock of offence
even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient.</hi>
Where he plainely teacheth, it is the obedience of faith; which
is required of all such as are truly baylt vpon this rock and
corner stone, Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>And this hath Christ himself also taught vs, when he
<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 7. 24. 25. 26. 27</note> like<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a wise man which hath built his house on a rock, against

not, vnto a foolish man which hath built his house vpon
the sand, against which the rayne and floods easily prevay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
to beat it down. So in like maner we are to know
for the question in hand, that the true Church of CHrist
is as a<note n="b" place="margin">Pro 9. 1 and 31. 10. 11. 12. Ephes. 5. 23. 24.</note> wise woman and faithfull wife which hearkning
to the voyce of her husband yeeldeth obedience vnto him,
and as an<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 16. 18. vvich pro 9. 1.</note> house built vpon the rock, against which the
gates of hell shall not be able to prevayle: Whereas the false
Church of Antichrist is as the<note n="d" place="margin">Pro. 9. 13—18. and 7. 10—23. Hos. 2. 2.</note> foolish woman and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lott,
which howsoever she pretend to heare the voyce of
Christ, yet in deed followeth the lust of her own eyes and goeth
a whoring after her own inventions: yea and pretending
onely the name of Christ, but in deed not receyving him as
her Prophet, Priest, and king, is as an house built vpon
the sand, which the<note n="e" place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 8. Rev. 18 8 21. Esa. 13. 19.</note> breath of Christs mouth and wynd
of his judgments will in the end consume and scatter abroad
as the dust. It is not then a verball profession in generall
that will serve, where an actuall denyall in practise is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
withall. But the true Church which is built vpon the
rock doth in deed and truth obey the Lord Iesus acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
him to be such as he is revealed vnto vs in the word
of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:17773:27"/>
This the Apostle Paul likewise teacheth vs, when he<note n="f" place="margin">Ephes. 2. 20.</note>
saith, <hi>the Church is built vpon the foundation of the Apostles
and Prophets, Iesus Christ himself being the head corner stone.</hi>
Wherein he giveth vs to learne that that is in deed the true
Church which is so built vpon Iesus Christ, as the Apostles
and Prophets have layd him for the foundation and head sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
in the corner, that is, have taught him to be the Sonne of
God come in the flesh, the Prophett, Priest and king of his
Church for ever. Which forasmuch as these together with

they cannot be esteemed truly built vpon the rock Iesus
Christ: and therefore cannot be counted the true Churches of
God, whiles we try them by the rules given vs by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets

consideration, I meane on the one side, a Church sett in the
way and order of Christ, but walking therein weakly and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly:
and on the other side, a company of people standing
in the defection a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d disorder of Antichrist, howsoever perhaps
they may walk ther in with some show of piety and religion.
The former are<note n="n" place="margin">Levit. 4. 13. 14. 1. Cor. 1. 2. 11. Act. 15. 1. 2. Rev. 2. and 3</note> true Churches, notwithstanding the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions

Now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forasmuch as neyther Mr H. nor any other of them
hath proved theyr assemblyes to stand in any other Church-constitution,
but such as is Antichristian: it is evident that
the Scriptures here alledged, which speak onely of Churches
sett in Christs order and of corruptions in them, cannot any
way fitly belong to these assemblyes, to give allowance of
theyr Antichristian estate. This being first sett down gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
concerning all these Scriptures ioyntly together for the
better vnderstanding of the controversy: let vs now come to
consider them more particularly, and see whether as Mr H.

These are the words.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Iehoash did that which was right in the eyes of the

                  <p>Notwithstanding the hy places were not taken away: as

               <q>
                  <p>And Iehoschaphat reigned over Iudah: and he walked
in the way of Asa his Father, and departed not there from,
doing that which was right in the eyes of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit the hy places were not taken away: for as yet
the people had not prepared theyr heart vnto the God of
theyr Fathers.</p>
                  <bibl> 2. Chron. 20. 31. 32. 33.</bibl>
               </q>
               <p>All these Scriptures show vnto vs one thing: which is,
that in the dayes of Iehoash, Amaziah, and Iehoschaphat,
kings of Iudah who did that which was right in the eyes
of the Lord, yet the hy places were not taken away: but
the people did sacrifice and burnt incense therein. This in
deed was a corruption among those people: concerning
which ynough is spoken before in that hath be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> said towching
these Scriptures generally. Yet this I adde further: first
that in those tymes all the false ministeryes and kinds of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
before tyme vsed were abolished, and this defect onely
of worshipping God in the <hi>hy places</hi> as yet remayning. Now
what comparison then is there between this case, and theyrs
who have not abolished but still retayne a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ioyne vnto a false
ministery and worship. Who knoweth not, that in those dayes
they might<note n="q" place="margin">Ios. 22. 23. 29. 2. King. 16. 10. 11. 12.</note> not forme to themselves or receyv from others
any other altar or fashion thereof for sacrifice then God had
appoynted: much lesse any new devised ministery? Yea, the<note n="r" place="margin">Levit. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sonnes of Aaron, though in a true a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d lawfull office, might not
offer with strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge fyer: much lesse might they have received or
exercised a false u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lawfull ministery. Corah likewise<note n="s" place="margin">Num. 16. Cap.</note> though a

God had appoynted to be offred, being straungers from the
priesthood: much lesse might they have offred a false worship
in a false ministery, etc. Which is the case of these assemblyes.
These men therefore should compare like things with like, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
not vnder colour of the <hi>hy places</hi> in Iudah, seke to retayne and
defend what Antichristian corruptions they please in theyr
Church. Otherwise why might they not also vnder the same
colour still have kept the other popish abominations, which
already (by the mercy of God) are abolished out of the
land?</p>
               <p>Secondly I take it, the fault of retayning the <hi>hy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in Iudah</hi> for the true service of GOD which at first were
made for false worship and service of Idols, was such, as if
now the false ministry, worship, and other abominations of
Antichrist were abolished out of the land, and yet these Idoll
temples (they call them Churches) reserved and vsed for
the true worship of God by a true ministery. For these two
may in divers respects seem to be like, I meane, those hy
places, and these Idoll temples. Both which I take
to be with in compasse of<note n="v" place="margin">Deut. 12. 2. 3. 4. Exod. 20. 4. 5. compared vvith 2. king 10. 26. 27. 28 and 23. 8. 13. 15. 19. Act. 19. 17. Rev. 18. 12. 22.</note> that morall commaundement of
God, which enioyneth the abolishing of the <hi>places</hi> aswell as
of all the other <hi>monuments</hi> of Idolatry, eyther by rasing
them quite downor by defacing and converting them to civill
vse: and not to tourne them to be places for the publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, though it were by such ministery and in such
maner as he hath appoynted.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by that which hath ben said, it is evident these
Scriptures show not that, for which they are alledged, that
is, prove not greater corruptions to have ben found in the
Churches aproved by the holy Gohst, then be now in the
Church assemblyes of England. I deny not but this sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
in the <hi>hy places</hi> was a great corruption: And so the Spirit
of God noteth it, that<note n="o" place="margin">2 Chro. 27. 2. vvith 2. King. 15. 34. 35.</note>

place thereof performed in such ministery and maner as he
had ordeyned. Neyther of which is yet to be seen in this
land.</p>
               <p>Lastly, in these Scriptures is to be observed, both the
different speaches concerning the <hi>Kings</hi> and concerning <hi>the
people</hi> in theyr ages, and that the testimony which the holy
Ghost giveth of them is such, as hath with it <hi>a note of
blemish and default</hi> in them: and that recorded to posterity,
not to encourage vs to fayle in like maner as they did, but to
be a warning vnto vs to take heed of being so overtaken, as
they were.</p>
               <p>And thus have I showed (so far as yet I see) the true
meaning and vse of these Scriptures, and how they serve not
at all to that purpose for which they are brought: as they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
ben also and still are wrested by the Papists, to boulster
out theyr most filthy abominations likewise, though all in
vayne. For great and strong is the truth, and will prevayle
against all ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ersaryes of it in the end.</p>
               <p>The next Scripture is out of<note n="vv" place="margin">Mat. 15. 5. 6.</note> Mat. 15. where Christ
reproving the Pharisees for transgressing the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God by theyr own tradition, proveth it thus: God
hath commaunded, saying, <hi>Honour thy father and mother:
and, he that curseth father or mother, let him dy the death.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>But you say, vvhosoever shall say to father or mother,
<hi>(It is, or, be it)</hi> a<note n="x" place="margin">A gift, that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote vnto God, or an oblation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</note> gift vvhatsoever thou might be holpen
vvith of me.</p>
                  <p>And shall not honour his father or his mother, he shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
giltles. Thus have ye made the commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God
of no authority by your tradition.</p>
                  <bibl> Mat. 15. 4. 5. 6.</bibl>
               </q>
               <p>Here we fynd a tast of that<note n="y" place="margin">Mat. 16. 6. 12.</note> leaven of the Pharisees,
whereof our Saviour Christ bad his disciples they should ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
heed and beware, and not that they should be encouraged
thereby to be more corrupt, as these men reason out of such
places. But let vs a litle compare this Scripture and theyr
estate together, and see whether is to be accounted more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
they then, or these now.</p>
               <p>First, we see here the disobedience taught by the Pharisees
was against the <hi>second Table:</hi> whereas the disobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce taught
by these men in the poynts now controverted is both against
<hi>the first and the second Table.</hi> Against the first, in teaching

and in such maner as Antichrist hath invented, and God
most straitly forbidden. Against the second, in<note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 20. 12. Pro. 24. 21. 1 Tim. 2. 2. 1. Pet. 2. 17.</note> disobeying the
Magistrates in deed, whom outwardly in show they would
seem to obey, whiles at theyr commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they serue God
by a false ministery and worship imposed by them. For as

so is it disobedience rather then obedience vnto them, to obey
them against the Lord.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Pharisees taught the people to neglect the
performance of a duty which they ought to theyr <hi>earthly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi>
in honouring of them: But these men teach the people to
neglect the performance of that<note n="c" place="margin">Mal. 1. 6. 2. Cor. 6. 17. 18. 1 Pet. 1. 17. 18</note> duty they o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

father,</hi> in honoring fearing and worshipping him as he
hath commaunded.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Pharisees taught the people to neglect man,
vnder colour of keeping a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow, or doing a duty <hi>to God,</hi> to witt,
the vowing or offering of that as an oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to God, by which

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, among the Iewes this disobedience against
man was taught <hi>by some,</hi> not<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 15. 2 and 16. 12. Luk. 1. 6. a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d 2. 25. 38.</note> receyved by all: But in the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se

                  <hi>of them all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, the Pharisees and other Iewes at that tyme (as
may appeare even by some<note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 8. 4 and 23. 2. Luk. 2. 21. 27 as also Luk. 1 6. 8. 9. 10. Ioh. 1. 19. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

people of these assemblyes at this day have such ministery and
worship as was never ordeyned by God, but devised by that
man of sinne: though otherwise they make some show of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes
and religion therein. So as in this respect there is no
comparison between these two.</p>
               <p>Lastly, it is to be observed that the testimony here given

of them therein, but both a<note n="f" place="margin">Mat. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

there was <hi>two principall priests</hi> ouer the rest: and yet the one
chief, and the other the second.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we fynd that <hi>Annas and Cayaphas</hi> here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

               <p>Thirdly, it is to be mynded that the word here vsed sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyeth
<hi>chief priests,</hi> and is spoken oftentymes of others that

that even then when there was but one by priest. As in Mat.

               <p>So then from this Scripture can be gathered no defence

not invented by the brayne of men, From heaven (I say) and

the resurrection of the body, thinking that the soule one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>And in the second of the Revelation, first to the Angell

it pleaseth God to try and exercise his Church from tyme to

it is, that in the Church of<note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 11 19.</note> Corinth <hi>spring vp schismes

(And such also in these dayes have crept in among vs,
vnder pretence of godlynes, who after a while vpon one occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

the Church, being authors of grievous schismes and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietyes,
for which the truth and Church have ben and still are

these assemblyes whose very<note n="s" place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 3. 4. 8. Reve. 18. 4. Esa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 52 11. Ier. 51. 6. 45.</note> constitution is Antichristian,

               <p>Thirdly, here is to be observed, that it is said, these Churches

theyr sinne, so it showeth also they had power, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d should vse it,
for the reclayming or casting out of such from among them.
Whereas these assemblyes have not power to redresse any
abominations or to excommunicate any persons (though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so wicked): but the whole ecclesiasticall power and iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
among them is committed onely to the Ordinary,
that is, to an Antichristian Prelate, and to his Chauncelour
and Archdeacon. So as by this also appeareth there is no
comparison between them.</p>
               <p>Fynally, it is to be remembred, that even in these and the
like Churches, where they do not repent and amend but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinew

               <p>IN this third exception according to theyr vsuall maner, Mr
H. taketh for graunted that which he should prove, to witt,
that theyr ecclesiasticall assemblyes be the Churches of Christ
sett in his order and constitution: Which thing we deny. And
till they prove it, themselves may see, they can not thus reason
from<note n="c" place="margin">Matt. 18. 15. 16 17.</note> 
                  <hi>this Scripture of Mat.</hi> 18. as here he doth. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
from thence it may be gathered, that the Churches of
Christ are not for corruptions arising in them to be forsaken,
but first theyr redresse is by all good meanes to be sought: yet
it followeth not therevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the Synagogues of Antichrist
are in like maner to be proceeded withall, and not forthwith
to be avoyded. This (I say) followeth not of the other any
more then if one should reason thus: A brother being knowen
to have sinned is not to be accounted as an heathen or publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
till being duly proceded with, he have contemned the voyce
of the Church: Therefore also one that is an heathen or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licane,
yet notwithstanding is not so to be accounted, till he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17773:35"/>
have ben likewise admonished and proceded withall. As the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
is no consequence in this, so neyther is there in the other.
The same<note n="d" place="margin">1. Cor. 5 12.</note> Scripture which saith, <hi>Do ye not iudge
them that are vvithin?</hi> saith it not also, <hi>What have I to do to
judge them that are vvithout?</hi> Now then as we are to carry
our selves after one maner towards particular men that are
within, and after another towards them that are without: so
have we also different rules and courses prescribed by God a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
to be followed by vs, how to walk after one maner towards
the Churches of Christ, when corruptions be found among
them, and after another towards the Synagogues of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
which are fallen into defection from the way of Iesus
Christ.</p>
               <p>If you aske, what these rules be that are given to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
when errors and enormityes are espyed in a true Church:
I aunswer, these and the like, that<note n="e" place="margin">Lev. 4. 13. 14. Act. 6 1. 2. 3. 2 Chro. 13. 2 3. vvith 15. 3. 11. 12. 13.</note> they which espy them,
are not therevpon to forsake the Church, but must first give
the Church knowledg thereof out of the word of God: and
that also according to due order, as first to<note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor 1. 11. vvith Rev 2. 1. &amp;c. Zach. 7. 2. 3. Heb 13. 17.</note> make it knowen
vnto them to whom the oversight of the Church is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
who, if they be perswaded, are<note n="g" place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 1. 4. 5. and 11 18. &amp;c. Mat. 18. 17. 1 Tim. 5. 17.</note> then by duty bound to

bring it before the whole Church and to show them theyr esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
wherein it swarveth from the rules of Gods Law: who
fynding it so to be, are bound to acknowledg and amend it.
Yet if this way they prevayle not, then are they to vse (if they

Scriptures show hath followed vpon such proceeding here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
that is that they will not now wilfully stand in kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
transgression convinced vnto them out of the word of
God by so many witnesses: but will rather sorrow for theyr
sinne, and reioyce for the consolation they shall fynd by recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the truth and walking in the way thereof showed vnto
them out of the Scriptures. But if they will not amend, the
Lord Iesus Christ, who walketh in the nuddes of the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
candelsticks and hath all power given him in heaven
and in earth, hath<note n="l" place="margin">Rev. 2. 5, Mat. 21. 43.</note> threatned to remove the candelstick out
of his place, and to take the kingdome of God from them
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17773:36"/>
and to give it to such as will bring forth the fruits thereof:
And then to such as are willing to obey the truth, he hath in
such cases given direct<note n="m" place="margin">Act. 2. 40. Psa. 8. 12. 16.</note> commaundement, to save themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
from such a froward generation: and to bynd vp the
testimony, and seale vp the Law among his disciples. And
these are the rules (so far as I have observed) given vs for
our walking in and toward the Churches of Christ, when
errors and corruptions be found among them.</p>
               <p>Now towching such assemblyes as stand in false consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
or <hi>apostasy</hi> from the way of Christ, the former rules are
not given vs to be vsed in a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with them: but concerning such,
there is one onely rule prescribed by God for our carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, which is,<note n="n" place="margin">Rev. 18. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from them, and in no case to partake in theyr sinnes, but
to witnes against them even vnto death. Forasmuch then as
these assemblyes (how famous so ever he account them)
stand in a false constitution, even in <hi>apostasy</hi> from that true
ministery and from those holy ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces appoynted by Christ
to his Church, it is cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>are as the sunne that the golden rules of
such proceding as is before described belong not vnto them in
this estate, but that all men ought vpon payne of damnation
without delay to depart out of them, least if they still partake
in theyr sinnes, they receyv also of theyr plagues. By which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
appeareth how the reason here vsed by Mr H. out of Mat.
18. belongeth not to theyr assemblyes, as now they stand, and
therefore in this case helpeth them nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Nay furthermore I dare affirme and bynd my self to prove
by <hi>this Scripture,</hi> that there is not (in theyr constitution) any
ecclesiasticall assembly in this land that can be accounted a
true Church, whereyn this rule here given by Christ can be
practised. And thus I prove it:
<q>
                     <p>Every true Church of Christ hath Christs power here
spoken of, to cast out obstinate sinners from among them.</p>
                     <p>But no ecclesiasticall assembly in this land hath (in their
constitution) this power of Christ here spoken of, to cast
out obstinate sinners from among them.</p>
                     <p>Therefore no ecclesiasticall assembly in this land can (in
their constitution) be accounted a true Church of Christ.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The proposition or first part of the reason is proved by<note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 18. 17. 18. 19. 20.</note>
                  <hi>this place of Scripture:</hi> as also by 1 Cor. 5. 4. 5. and Mat. 28.
20. The assumption or latter part of the reason I prove thus:
First, the power of excommunication among them resteth in
the Lordbishop and in his Chauncelor a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Archdeacon, whose
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17773:36"/>
offices and authority Christ never ordeyned in his Church:
therefore can not they (in theyr constitution) have the power of
Christ here spoken of. Secondly, the offices a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d authority of the
Prelates aforesaid are Antichristian: therefore also ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they not
in such estate have this power of Christ: For<note n="p" place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 14. 15.</note> what fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
can there be between Christ and Antichrist? Thirdly, let
vs suppose, that some of theyr Church committeth a sinne, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
is admonished to repent of it by another of them: the sinner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth
not, the other taketh with him one or two to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
and witnes against him: the sinner notwithstanding still
persisteth: Now what shall the other do, or whither shall they
go? If to the Prelates and theyr Officials, who among them
have the power of excommunication in theyr hands, that is
not to follow this rule of Christ, but to show theyr subiection
to Antichrist: If to that parish whereof the party is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
(as for example, let vs suppose the best among them, as
Blackfryers or Mary Overyes in London, or Ashby de la
zouch in Lepcester shire, or Maldon in Essex, or Coventry in
warwick shire, or any other) alas what are they the nearer?
Though they would, yet in theyr constitution can they do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but eyther go themselves or bid the other go and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne
to the Lordbishop theyr Ordinary, or to his Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor
or Archdeacon, who have the government of the Church
committed vnto them. Or if they should offer to proceed other
wise to excommunication of the party, they are so far from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
power to do it, as neyther were such a one by the Law
of theyr Church to be accounted excommunicate, and they also
whosoever should attempt so to do, were subiect for this cause
to be excommunicate themselves, yea and to be imprisoned a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
further punished by theyr Lords the Prelates. Lo here how
these assemblyes (even the best of them) in theyr constitution
can not practise<note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 18. 15. 16. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>this rule of Christ,</hi> which he hath given vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and may be practised by, every true Church of his. The
Lord give them eyes to see it, and hearts to depart from the
tents of such vngodlynes.</p>
               <p>Thus having showed that there is no more strength of
proof in this third exception, then was in the former: I might
proceed to that which followeth in his letter, save that a few
things which he hath here inserted by the way, seem needfull
first to be to wched. As first, where speaking of vs, he termeth
a Church sett in the order of Christ to be <hi>private members.</hi>
Towching which this I thought to note, that a company of
faithfull people (though considered apart by themselves
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17773:37"/>
they be private men, yet) being gathered together in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of Christ, and joyned together in fellowship of his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
they are a<note n="r" place="margin">1. Cor. 12 27. Roma. 12 5. Hebr. 12. 22. 28. Mat. 5. 14. a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d 18. 17. 20. 1. Cor. 1. 2. and 5. 4. Phil. 1. 1. 5. Act. 2. 41. 42 47. and 17. 4</note> publik body, a Church, a citty, a kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
and that of Iesus Christ, who is present among them to
guyde blesse and confirme what they do on earth in his Name
and by his power. So that like as in a Citty, the citizens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
apart are commonly private members, yet ioyntly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
are the corporation and publik body of that town: so
is it also in the Church of Christ, whether it consist of mo or of
fewer, yea though they be but<note n="s" place="margin">Mat. 18. 19. 20.</note> two or three: so as they be
joyned together in communion of the Gospell, and gathered
together in the Name of Iesus Christ, as before is said.</p>
               <p>Secondly, where he accounteth themselves a true Church,
<hi>having many famous assemblyes, and to be proceeded against by
the rule of Christ, Mat.</hi> 18. I have already aunswered and sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
that first he must prove theyr assemblyes to be sett in the
way of Christ, afore these sayings can be verifyed of them, or
applyed to them. Many there are in deed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them famous
for theyr gifts, learning, wisdome, sobriery etc. but they also
stand subject to the same Antichristian disorder and confusion
that the rest do. Neyther doubt I but in the most popish as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblyes
there be also many famous for theyr gifts and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
which yet can no way justify theyr Antichristian estate.
The Lord in mercy graunt, that such as belong to him, may
bring themselves and theyr gifts vnto Zion for the help and
beauty thereof: and no more employ them (as they have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne)
to the adorning of Babel, that whoore and strumpett ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
to destruction, with all her ordinances and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
wheresoever.</p>
               <p>Thirdly where he saith, <hi>there be many of the Ministers in
England that are not yet in theyr judgment perswaded of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline:</hi>
I aske, whether he think not also there be many of
the Ministers in Rome, Spayne, and els where, that like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
are not in theyr judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t perswaded of sundry other most
excellent doctrines of the Gospell? And whether therefore all
other that see them, must stay from acknowledging and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
them, vntill such also be perswaded of them. If Iohn
wickleff, William Swinderby, Walter Brute, Iohn Clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Martin Luther, Iohn Hus, Ierome of Prage, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Tyndall, Iohn Frith, Robert Barnes, Iohn Rogers,
Hugh Latymer, Iohn Bradford, Rowland Taylour, Iohn
Philpott, and other the faithfull servants and Martyrs of
Iesus Christ, should in theyr severall ages have stayed from
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17773:37"/>
obeying the Gospell, so far as God revealed vnto them out of
his word, vpon this and such like pretences of the ignorance
and error of others: I would know, whether in so doing they
had ben faithfull to God, as they ought. But besides these,
I would also aske, whether it might not with as great colour
(if not greater in some respect) have ben said to the Apostles
and Primitive Churches, that the Priests and Levites of
the Iewes were not perswaded in iudgment that Iesus was
the Christ? To conclude, is it not straunge that in so great
alight, they should still labour with such, figge tree leaves to
cover the nakednes of theyr filthy abominations?</p>
               <p>The next exception he taketh (when he saith, that <hi>other
of theyr ministers do yeeld vnto the discipline in iudgment, and
desier hartely the establishment of it and the removall of all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
yet cannot see how they may with a good conscience
forsake the callings and roomes they occupy, for the want of the
discipline</hi>) This exception, I say, which also might be alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for the papists, is of like nature with the former: or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
much worse, inasmuch as he graunteth they yeeld to the
truth in iudgment, and deny it in practise. They know (by
his graunt) that Christ hath appoynted an order of Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and government to his Church, for the administration of
his holy things and for keping his people in the obedience of
faith, with commaundment to observe it to the end of the
world (for this they<note n="t" place="margin">In all theyr treat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and may throughly see and consider in theyr hearts how

(here called the <hi>discipline</hi>) which Christ hath<note n="vv" place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 13. 14. Mat. 28. 20.</note> straitly

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly where he excepteth, that <hi>they havve not ben cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
by other Churches, and therefore are not thus to be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:</hi>
besides that which hath ben aunswered before towching
their Antichristian estate, in respect whereof they are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from without any other censuring: Besides this (I
say) I would know, by what Churches the assemblyes in Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
Germany, Fraunce, and England were censured, when
Arnoldus de villa nova, Ierome of Prage, Martin Luther,
Iohn Calvin, William Tyndall, the Baldenses, and the
Bohemians, with many other the servants of God in former
ages left and forsook them? Or whether they should still have
remayned in Babylon, till by some Churches she had ben cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured?
Yea, and how there could ever be a true visible Church
agayne vpon the earth after the <hi>generall apostasy</hi> wherein all
nations were made drunken with Babels cup, if the people
of God should not at his<note n="c" place="margin">Rev<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18. 4</note> commaundment depart out of
Babylon, without staying till there were some Churches to

we to be from bringing balme to cure her, or abiding in her

it is the part and duty of every faithfull man to separate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

God hath placed it: yea though the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary edicts of Princes

first we can not fynd it to consist of a company of

faithfull people so separated according to the word of God
and the vse of the reformed Churches, but to stand in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of all sorts of people, good and bad, even of the greatest
persecuters and most profane of the land, after the maner of
Antichrist and his Babylonish assemblyes: secondly we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see that notwithstanding the prohibition of Princes and
Magistrates, they submitt themselves to the doctrine and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline
of the Church appoynted by Christ, but that they
stand in subiection to the ministery a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d discipline of Antichrist.
Wherevpon it followeth that in this constitution they cannot
iustly be deemed</hi> a Sister <hi>of the reformed Churches abroad, but
of the daughters of the great Babylon spoken of in the book
of the Revelation, chap.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next, towching the Ministery and government, which
Christ hath given to his Church, the reformed Churches</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">In the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me book: Section, 11. French and Belgick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</note> 
                  <hi>beleeve and professe, that</hi> the true CHVRCH
ought to be governed by that regiment or discipline, which our
Lord Iesus hath established, to witt, so that there be in it Pastors,
Elders, and Deacons: <hi>That</hi> all true Pastors in what place soever
they be placed, have the same and aequall authority among them
selves given vnto them vnder Iesus Christ the onely head and
the chief and alone vniversall Bishop: <hi>And that</hi> the Ministers, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and deacons ought to be called to those theyr functions, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
by the lawfull election of the Church to be advaunced into tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
roomes, earnest prayer being made vnto God, and after the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and maner which is sett down vnto vs in the word of God.
<hi>And on the other side,</hi>
                  <note n="k" place="margin">In the same book: Sect. 11. Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetia: the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confes. Capit. 18.</note> towching the new ministeryes brought

Suffraganes, Metropolitanes, Archpriests, Deacons, Subdeacons,
and the rest of that sort, higher and lower: towching all these
<hi>(say they)</hi> we passe not a rush, what they have ben in tymes past,
or what they are now: the Apostles doctrine concerning Minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
sufficeth vs. And no man can by any right forbid vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne

<hi>Thus we see what the reformed Churches professe to be theyr

we compare the present constitution of the ecclesiasticall assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyes
of this land, wherein are not onely wanting the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said

the calling and administration appoynted by Christ and
acknowledged by the reformed Churches: but are also remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the false offices and vsurped authority of Archbisho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they have reiected as Antichristia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) together with theyr popish

who cannot see that the reformed Churches are in the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
things so far from giving to these assemblyes the right hand
of fellowship, as they do rather with the left hand put them
over to Antichrist with whom they communicate and vnto
whom they belong in this behalf?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, for the whole worship of God, the reformed
Churches<note n="l" place="margin">Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess. Sect. 1. in the Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick and French con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions.</note> professe that <hi>the whole maner of worshipping God
which God requireth at the hands of the faithfull, is in the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
word of God most exquisitly and at large set dovvn: and
that therefore it is not lawfull for any man or Angel to teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
to adde or to detract therefrom, it being perfit and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
in all poynts and parcels thereof. So as no other vvritings of
men although never so holy, no custome, no multitude, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
vvisdome, no antiquity, no prescription of tyme, no personall
succession, no counsels, visions, miracles, and to conclude, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
statutes, or ordinances of men, are to matched vvith or
opposed vnto the holy Scriptures and bare truth of God: but that
all things ought to be examined and tryed by the rule and square
thereof. For all men are by nature ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rs and more vayne then
vanity it self.</hi> Thus do the reformed Churches hold and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse.
Whereas on the contrary in England the maner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and administration, is not according to the word of God,
but according to theyr book of common prayer taken out of
the Papists Masse book, together with other theyr Canons,
Articles, and Constitutions, which God hath neyther him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
appoynted in his word nor therein given authority to any
other so to prescribe. And thus have I showed by the publik
confessions and iudgment of the reformed Churches themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,
that it is far otherwise then as these men would beare
the world in hand: and that in deed the Church-assemblyes in
England in this constitution can not rightly be counted <hi>sisters</hi>
of the reformed Churches abroad, but rather <hi>daughters</hi> of<note n="m" place="margin">Rev. 17 5.</note>
Babylon that mother of whoredomes and abominations of
the earth.</p>
               <p>Next where Mr H. showeth how <hi>a private Christian</hi> should
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17773:40"/>
carry himself towardan <hi>whole Church</hi> towching corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
I have before spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that matter a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d noted two maners of
proceding to be appoynted by God, one toward such Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
as be set in the order of Christ but walk in it corruptly,
another toward such as sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the apostasy of Antichrist
though with some show of holynes. This therefore being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled, shal not need to be repeated. By it may appeare
how vnsound a directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath here prescribed: besides that
what he sayth, may with like colour be alledged for abiding in
any the most popish assemblyes wheresoever. For might
not such alledge for themselves, that they <hi>mislike the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in those Churches, that they refuse to subscribe or yeeld
consent vnto them, that by prayer and all other good meanes
they seek the reformation of them: Yet that being private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
or a fevv severall assemblyes, they may not account the
Churches that are in an vvhole nation to be as beathens or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licanes:</hi>
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that therefore they will abide in them still? If this
be a sufficient rule, then suerly the Martyrs were deceyved in
former ages, and the godly Christians at this day in Spay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
Italy, and such places, which content not themselves
with misliking and seeking redresse of the corruptions in theyr
popish assemblyes, but refuse altogether to have any spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
fellowship with them, and chuse rather to suffer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
for bearing witnes agaynst them.</p>
               <p>Secondly how can they be sayd to <hi>mislike the corruptions,</hi>
wherevnto many of them subscribe with theyr hands, and
all of them joyne in theyr practise? Or how do they refuse to
<hi>yeeld consent</hi> to the corruptions, which by word and deed
they receyv, allow, and vphold?</p>
               <p>Thirdly where he insinuateth that <hi>by prayer and other
good meanes they seek a reformation,</hi> I would aske, with
what comfort they can come before God in prayer, when they
do not onely stand subject to Antichrist (in respect whereof
theyr<note n="n" place="margin">Pro. 28. 9. vvith Rev. 14. 9. 10. Iohan. 9. 31. Psal. 66. 18.</note> sacrifices of prayer must needs be abominable),
but by their continuall practise seem to deale like those Iewes
of whom we<note n="o" place="margin">Ier. 42. 2. 5. 6. vvith vers. 20. 21.</note> read in Ieremy the Prophet, that by theyr
requests they made show as if they would know the will of
God to obey it, and yet when they knew it, would not observ
it. If by <hi>other good meanes,</hi> he vnderstand theyr suits to the
Parliament, as it is an<note n="p" place="margin">Rev. 17. 16 1 Tim. 2. 2. 3. 2 King. 23. Cap.</note> happy thing and greatly to be
desired that the Magistrates would abolish this false eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
Ministery, worship, and government: so yet if they
do it not, we must notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding at the<note n="q" place="margin">Act. 2. 40 41 47. Rev. 18. 4. 2 Cor. 6. 17. 18. Psa. 119. 113. 128.</note> commaundement
of God leave all false, wicked, and Antichristian wayes, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17773:40"/>

all day long, being counted as sheep for the slaughter. 1. For in
this case must alway be reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred, that<note n="s" place="margin">Act. 4. 19. Rev. 14. 12. Mat. 22. 21.</note> we must obey God
rather then Man: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement or permissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
the Magistrate maketh not the way of God any whit more
lawful, but onely more free from trouble. 2. Agayn, if the lawes
of men do once enact a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d establish the true ministery a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Christ, then must all be forced to submit thereu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were Christs or not: So as to withold our obedience
from Christ till the Law enact it, is nothing els but to stay till
we be forced by man to the obedience of God. 3. Furthermore,
what if the Magistrates would never establish that ministery
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d order which Christ hath appoynted to his Church: should
we therefore never observ and submitt vnto it? To what end
then hath Christ<note n="t" place="margin">Mat. 28. 20.</note> enioyned vs (without any exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the
Magistrates Law) to keep whatsoever he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded,
to the end of the world? And why hath the Apostle so<note n="v" place="margin">1. Tim. 6 13. 14.</note> strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
charged Timothy (a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in him<note n="vv" place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 2.</note> all others) before God a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

towching the Ministery order and governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Church,
without spot and vnblameable, vntill the appearing of our
Lord Iesus? 4. To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude this poynt, if without the Magis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates
allowa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce we might not observ whatsoever Christ hath
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, what were this els but to<note n="x" place="margin">Iam. 2. 1.</note> have the faith of our

counsell wisheth in any case to be avoyded. And thus much
by the way towching the obedience which all Christians are

this was done of the Iewes to absteyne from the Publicanes
in theyr civill conversation whom they admitted to theyr pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik

I show, that whereas Christs speach (when he<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 18. 17.</note> saith <hi>Let

custome and practise of the Iewes, who had no<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 21. 27. 28. 29.</note> spirituall

therefore the meaning of these words (<hi>Let him be to thee as

voyce we should have no familiar civill conver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

of the Iewes which his disciples could not but know,
the meaning of his words when he said <hi>Let him be to thee as

<hi>and as a publicane</hi> (with whom they had no civill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation)

               <p>And this is that <hi>order,</hi> wherein by the mercy of God
we have receyved to walk: though we do it with much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
through owr own coruption that hangeth so fast vpon
vs. Now if Mr H. or any other will needs account this to
be <hi>confusion,</hi> yet may not we therefore be likewise mynded:

but we must rather with the Apostle<note n="t" place="margin">Col. 2. 5.</note> reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,

do I not deny, but there have ben and still may be among vs

power and of those rules which Christ hath giuen to his

they burst out into manifest vngodlynes. Therefore are we
not to look, that the Church shall wholy be free from such,

and certainely knowen, the Church hath power
and is to vse it for the purging of such leaven from among
them, that they may be an holy people to the Lord. And this
still is <hi>order,</hi> not <hi>confusion</hi> in the Church.</p>
               <p>Now here on the other side might I put Mr. H. in mynd of
the <hi>extreem confusion</hi> which is to be seen in theyr assemblyes:
in theyr constrayning of all though never so wicked, together
with theyr seed, to stand members of theyr Church: in theyr
false Antichristian ministery of Archbishops, Lordbishops,
Archdeacons, Priests, Parsons, Uicars, and the rest of that
crew: in theyr stinted popish Leyturgy, according to which
they offer vp theyr prayers, administer theyr Sacraments,

and all these by the Prelates, according to theyr popish ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons

professeth that they detest the whole order of papistry called

               <p>His third and mayne proof whereby he would show that
nothing is practised among them so contrary to the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline

thinking belike that it is a very sound proof. Which whether
it be so, I leave to every indifferent reader to iudge by that

               <p>After this, he laboreth to prove that we should account

called those levves, that had crucifyed Christ, brethren, Act. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

should not Iohn Wickleff, Martin Luther and the rest in

brethren, till they had ben convinced and reiected by the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>For the second, that is, <hi>Pauls accounting of the Galatians
to be a true Church notvvithstanding some of them erred in
matters that vvere fundamentall:</hi> Mr H. should also have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
first that it was but some of them that did so erre,
and not the whole Church: secondly, that they were a Church
established in the order of Christ, howsoever walking therein,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17773:43"/>
some of them declyned and fell into heynous errors. So as
now in regard of the ordinance of Christ wherein they stood,
they were to be accounted a true Church, and first to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
and convinced before they could be reiected: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
hath ben showed at large. But how doth this prove,
the assemblyes which stand in Antichristian defection should

                  </gap>ormityes duly to be sought, must therefore the Synagogues
of Antichrist make clayme to the same priviledges and maner
of proceding? Or because the members of true Churches are
to be accounted brethren, till having wilfully refused to repent,
they eyther be cast out, or having leavened the whole lumpe,
the candelstick be removed from them all: must therefore the
members of Antichristian assemblyes be had in the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,

work vpon the consciences of men by vertue of an Antichristian office

but the Prela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To the first of these reasons I aunsvver, that although the name of Priests
belong not to the true ministers of the Gospell, because it hath ben generally in

and ceremonyes appoynted by the lavv to be vsed at they ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vvhich I cannot iustify, and many of those good orders neglected vvhich the
Scripture prescribeth in this case: yet is that office vvhich the lavves of our land
call the office of the Priesthood, the very same in substance vvith the Pastors of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

               <p>THis is M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> H. his generall aunswer to the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part of the
reason: which is needfull first to be considered, before we
come to the particulars which follow, that so both the stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth
of the truth a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the subtilty of his aunswer may better appeare.</p>
               <p>First he yeeldeth (as needs he must) that <hi>they have no other
office in the Church, then that which the Lawes of the land al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:</hi>
For this is alledged in the proof of the second part of the
reason, and is not at all gaynesayed by him. Yet most of them
which are of the better sort among them, when they are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
pressed about theyr ministery, disclayme their offices and
callings receyved from and by the Prelates (which onely are
allowed by the Lawes of the land) and fly to I know not
what office and calling receyved from some of theyr forward
Ministers and people: as himself also doth in this his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note n="*" place="margin">Section, 10</note>
afterward, where he saith, that <hi>many ministers in the land
have, and all may, if they will have, these substantiall parts of
a true calling, examination of theyr gifts by the godly and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi>
choyse of the people, and a right ordination: for I
<pb facs="tcp:17773:45"/>
would aske, why he saith <hi>many</hi> (and not all the) Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
in the Land have these, if it be not because he would fly
from the calling by the Prelates to that other devised calling
by theyr Ministers and people. Otherwise if he affirme these
things, of the calling and ordination by the Prelates, then all
(and not onely <hi>many</hi>) of theyr Ministers have and must ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
it, seing the lawes of the Land allow no other: And then
also should he have shewed these particulars to be had in that
calling of the Prelates: which cannot be done, as will more
appeare hereafter. Thus is he driven to fight not onely against
other of his fellowes, but even against himself, whilest he
fighteth against the truth: for which I am sory on his behalf.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is to be noted that he yeeldeth (as also needs
he must) that <hi>the lawes of the land allow no other office in the
Church but the Prelacy, Priesthood, and Deaconry:</hi> of which
it was and is still affirmed, that they are all <hi>Antichristian of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</hi>
Which if he would have taken away, then should he
have proved that they are not such, but are by Christ in his
Testament appoynted to his Church. But seing this neyther
is neyther can be avowched by the word of GOD, we must
needs account of them as they be in deed, even the brood of
Antichrist, never knowen nor heard of in the Church of Iesus
Christ.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is to be observed that whereas theyr Prelacy,
Priesthood a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Deaconry were all and every of them charged
to be Antichristian: he speaketh onely in behalf of theyr <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi>
and helpeth not the <hi>Prelacy</hi> or <hi>Deaconry</hi> at all no not so
much as with any show of defence, but leaveth them on the
playne field to shift for themselves aswell as they may. It see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
theyr cause is very bad, that is so quite forsaken when it
is so deeply charged, and that fyndeth no succor at his hands
who hath himself be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Deacon after theyr maner, and receyved
from that (Prelacy which thus he forsaketh) that office of
Priesthood which yet he retayneth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it can but seem straunge that he should by this
meanes graunt the <hi>Prelacy and Deconry to be Antichristian,</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
yet plead for the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> as if it were not of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
when as it is no other office but such as is derived from
the Prelacy, and wherevnto theyr Deaconry is a step. As if
we could<note n="p" place="margin">Iob. 14. 4.</note> bring a cleane thing out of filthynes? Or as if
we could<note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 7. 16.</note> gather grapes of thornes, or figs of thistles?
Eyther therefore (as Christ<note n="r" place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his fruite good, or els make the tree evill and his fruit evill.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17773:45"/>
Eyther let them prove theyr Prelacy and Deaconry to be good
according to the Testament of Christ, or els they cannot plead
for the Priesthood which ariseth from them: Or if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
the Prelacy and Deaconry to be evill and Antichristian,
then must they also acknowledg the same of the priesthood
which yssueth from them.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, it is to be marked likewise, that Mr. H. graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<hi>the name of Priests doth not belong to the true Ministers of
the Gospell.</hi> wherevpon I would aske, whether the <hi>office</hi> of
Priests belong vnto them any more then the <hi>name.</hi> If he auns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
no, as in deed he must: then will follow, that seing ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Name nor office of Priests belongeth to the true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of the Gospell, and yet himself with the rest of them all
have the name and office of Priests, and by vertue thereof pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d administer the Sacraments, therefore they are not true
Ministers of the Gospell. Now whereas he assigneth this to
be the reason why the name of Priests belongeth not to the
Ministers of the Gospell, <hi>because it hath ben generally in our
language given to the popish sacrificers:</hi> this semeth not to be
the reason, but rather these which follow: First, because<note n="s" place="margin">Heb. 7. 11 &amp;c.</note>
the Leviticall priesthood being ceased, Christ hath not now
instituted any office of Priests for ministery vnto his Church,
but remayneth himself a priest for ever after the order of. Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hisedec,
having a priesthood that can not passe from one vnto
another. Secondly, because in all the New Testament it is
not read that the name of <hi>Priest</hi> doth note out any of those of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
which Christ hath instituted for the instruction and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of his Church vnder the Gospell. Otherwise if
Christ had eyther ordeyned an office of Priests for the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his Gospell, or if the name <hi>Priest</hi> were vsed in the new
Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to note out the Ministers of Christ vnder the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell:
it were no sufficient cause why the <hi>name</hi> might and ought
not still belong vnto them, because it hath ben generally in our
language given to the popish sacrificers. The name of Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
Deacons, Baptisme, Eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and such like have ben and are generally in our language given
to the false offices, sacraments, and censures of the Church of
Antichrist: Yet do they notwithstanding belong to the true of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
Sacraments, and censures of the Church of Christ:
Even as in the tyme of the Law the name of Priests, Altars,

otherwise now for attributing the name of Priests to the
Ministers of the Gospell: as hath ben showed before, and
is agayn vpon other occasion more to be towched hereafter.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, it is here to be noted that he sayth <hi>there be sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
circumstances and ceremonyes appoynted by the Law to be
vsed at theyr ordination of Priests vvhich he cannot justify,</hi>
Yea <hi>and that many of those good orders be neglected vvhich
the Scripture prescribeth in this case:</hi> and yet both<note n="v" place="margin">Section. 10.</note> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
toward the end of his writing he confesseth <hi>he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> sought
and receyved his calling from the Prelates,</hi> and<note n="vv" place="margin">Section, 3. Pag. 17.</note> before in
the aunswer of the first part of the reason he acknowledged
that <hi>the least part of Christs ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces cannot be neglected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
grievous sinne.</hi> Now lay together these things, which
this writing of his and theyr continuall practise witnesseth of
themselves: and then see in what wofull case they stand, and
mourne for theyr misery. Theyr sinne is grievous in theyr own
eyes, yet by theyr own confession they do wittingly seek after
it and persist in it. They know aforehand that the Prelates
ordering them will commit <hi>grievous sinne</hi> and so provoke the
Lords wrath, yet do they seek to be ordeyned by them, and
plead in defence thereof what they can. Is not this to<note n="x" place="margin">Esa. 6. 9. 10.</note> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
eyes, and not to see? or (to make the best of it) is it not
<note n="y" place="margin">Rom. 3. 8.</note> to do evill, that good may come thereon? of whom the
Apostle sayth, the damnation of such is just. Suerly the<note n="z" place="margin">Tit. 11. 12. vvith Ephes. 5. 11.</note>
grace that bringeth salvation teacheth otherwise, even to deny
all vngodlynes, and not to have any fellowship with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull
works of darknes but to reprove them rather. So
the Apostle<note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 22.</note> chargeth Timothy and in him all Ministers,
to keep themselves pure and not to communicate with other
mens sinnes. And the Lord from heaven hath<note n="b" place="margin">Rev. 18. 4.</note> commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
all his servants to go out of Babylon, and not to parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
in her sinnes, that they receyv not of her plagues. Howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
therefore M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. H. a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the rest of them account of this theyr

a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therefore to be shunned of all such as have care to keep
faith and a good conscience, and the contrary to be witnessed in
testimony of the truth of Iesus Christ whose servants we are.</p>
               <p>Finally, it is here to be observed how they would beare
the world in hand, that they fayle but <hi>in circumstances and
ceremonyes, not in the substance, of the ministery.</hi> Where we
may first consider, how these forward preachers are now dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17773:46"/>
to the same shift, wherevnto they drove the Prelates and
Formalists heretofore. The<note n="c" place="margin">Admon. to Parl. T. C. his replyes.</note> forward preachers proved
this Ministery a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d worship to be Antichristian: The<note n="d" place="margin">VVhitg. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>idges. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me etc.</note> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
and theyr Proctors pleaded that they fayled but in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance,
and not in substance. Secondly it is to be noted
how they would vnder the name of ceremonyes and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
subtilly hide that fowle heap of abominations, which
they have taken out of the whores cup of Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
whereof have<note n="e" place="margin">Pag. 19. 30. 77.</note> before divers tymes ben handled,
and therefore need not here agayn be mentioned. Thirdly, if
it were so that they fayled but in circumstances and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes,
yet they should remember that the<note n="f" place="margin">Levit. 10 1. 2. 1 Chro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 13. 9. 10.</note> iudgment of God
overtook Nadab, Abihu, Uzziah and others recorded in the
Scripture, for transgressing in matters of ceremony and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance.
And what priviledge have they now above others
to stand in knowen and grievous sinne against the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
and his ordinances? Or are they<note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 22.</note> stronger then God,
that they will thus still provoke him to anger? Fourthly, it
is to be knowen, and they should do well to sett down, what
they account the <hi>substance</hi> of the Ministery. Mr. H.<note n="h" place="margin">Section, 10.</note> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
speaking of the entrance into the Ministery, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
down three substantiall parts thereof, as he calleth them:
first a due tryall: secondly, the choyse of the people (it seemeth
he meaneth a true visible Church, els he speaketh not to the
purpose): thirdly, a right ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Of which three seing in his
own vnderstanding (as appeareth afterward) he can not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
deny but most of theyr Ministers want all, and all theyr
Ministers want some (to witt, the choyse of a true visible
Church, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a right ordination) it is evident by his own graunt
they want the substance of a true calling to the Ministery, and
therefore fayle not onely in circumstance as he would pretend.</p>
               <p>But that we may the better try out the truth in this poynt,
I will here sett down what I take to be substantiall in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery.
And that is, first that it be a true and lawfull office of
ministery which is receyved a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, executed, that is, that it be such
as Christ in his Testament hath given to his Church for the
work of his ministery: secondly, that there be a lawfull calling
and entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce into such office as is aforesaid: thirdly, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
thereof be according to the Testament of Christ.
Other things there be also which are of great waight tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
the ministery: but these three specially I take to be such
as are substantiall vnto it: Insomuch as none of these can be
wanting to the execution of a true ministery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:17773:47"/>
For towching the first, that is a true and lawfull office
prescribed by Christ, if it might be wanting in a true minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
to what end were it that Christ hath<note n="i" place="margin">Eph. 4. 11 12. 13.</note> given to his
Church certayne and distinct <hi>offices</hi> for the work of the minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
to the end of the world? Or how should it be true in this
case, which the Apostle<note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 12 5. 28.</note> saith of all the offices appoynted

enter not in by the doore into the sheepfold, but clymbe vp ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<note n="p" place="margin">Ioh. 13. 20. Luk. 10. 16.</note> said, <hi>Verily, Verily I say vnto you, If I send any, he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyveth

hath God by the<note n="q" place="margin">Ier. 23. 21.</note> Prophet Ieremy complayned against
and reiected the false Prophets in this respect, saying, <hi>I have
not sent these Prophets, yet they ranne: I have not spoken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, yet they prophecy.</hi> Lastly, if a true and lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
were not substantiall and necessary to the execution of a
true ministery, then why might not men devise new kinds of
entrance, or intrude themselves into the ministery at theyr
pleasure? Both which are vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>For the third, that is <hi>a lavvfull administration according
to the Testament of Christ,</hi> that it also cannot be wanting the
Scripture showeth many tymes and sundry wayes. First
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17773:47"/>
in that the Apostle chargeth Timothy to<note n="r" place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>keep the true pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne</hi>

words of our Lord Iesus Christ and to the doctrine which is

                  <hi>this very cause</hi> he wrote vnto Timothy, and in him to<note n="v" place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 2.</note>

charge before God and the Lord I Esus Christ and the elect

vntill the appearing of our Lord Iesus. Thirdly, in
that he teacheth that even<note n="x" place="margin">2 Tim. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>to this end</hi> the whole Scripture
is given by inspiration and is profitable to teach to improve

may be absolute being fully furnished to every good work.</hi>
Fourthly, in that the Apostles themselves did account it sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall
and of necessity in theyr<note n="y" place="margin">2 Pet. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<note n="a" place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 11. and 5. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. 3.</note> requireth of all others, that they speak <hi>the words of

but of a ready mynd, not as though they were Lords over
Gods heritage but as ensamples to the flock. Fiftly, Christ
himself the Lord of his Church hath taught this both by prac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tise
and commaundement. By his practise, when concerning
his own ministration he<note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but the Father which sent me gave me a commaundement what
I should say and what I should speak: and I know that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement

Thus then appeareth that in a true and lawfull ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it is substantiall and necessary, there be first a true and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
office, that is, such as Christ hath in his Testament given
to his Church: secondly, a lawfull calling and entrance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto:
thirdly, a lawfull administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof according to the
said Testament of Iesus Christ. So as to prove that they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
the substance of a true ministery, Mr. H. should have sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
out of the Scripture, theyr offices, entrance, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration:
theyr <hi>offices</hi> (I say) of Archbishops, Lordbishops,
Deanes, Prebendaryes, Archdeacons, Parsons, Uicars, Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendaryes,
and all other sorts of Priests and Deacons among
them: theyr <hi>entrance</hi> likewise by the Lordbishops, according to
theyr popish pontificall, that is, according to theyr book of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrating
Archbishops and Bishops and of ordering Priests
and Deacons, together with theyr Patrones presentations,
theyr institutions, inductions, othes of Canonicall obedience
to the Prelates, and such like: finally, theyr <hi>administration</hi> of
the word, Sacraments, and Censures, by vertue of the offices
afore said, and according to theyr popish book, canons, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
together with the performance of such actions as
belong not at all to the dutyes of the ministery, such as be the
Churching of women, the solemnization of mariage, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over the dead at burial, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the like. These (I say) he should
have showed by the Scriptures, if he would prove vnto vs
that they have the <hi>substance</hi> of the ministery of the Gospell.
Which because it neyther is neyther ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be done by the word of
God: therefore can we in no wise be perswaded that <hi>they have
the substance of a true ministery and fayle but in circumstance,</hi>
as he would here beare vs in hand. Yet because he pretendeth
as if he could prove that which he saith, let vs see what stuffe
he bringeth to this purpose. It followeth therefore in his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for proof of his former assertion, in this wise.</p>

he is expresly charged at his ordination to do: and forbidden to teach any
thing as required of necessity vnto salvation, but that vvhich he is persvvaded
may be concluded and proved by the Scripture: Yea it commaundeth him vvith
all faithfull diligence to banish and drive avvay all erroneous and straunge doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
that are contrary to Gods vvord. Doth the vvord authorise him to adminis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

should not onely publikly teach, but also oversee and look to the peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
exhorting, admonishing, reproving, and comforting them asvvell pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17773:48"/>
as publikly? Even so doth our Lavv. Lastly, doth the vvord authorise the
minister to execute the censures and discipline of Christ? Our lavv doth also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
the same. So that (although many to vvhom the execution of these things
appertayne do grievously fayle in the practise thereof, yet you see) the office vvhich
the Lavv inioyneth to the Minister, is the same in substance vvith that vvhich the
vvord layeth vpon him.</p>

               <p>THis is then Mr H. his proof, by which he would perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
vs that theyr Priests have the same office in substance
with the Pastors appoynted in the word, <hi>because the Law
of the land requireth of theyr Priests the performance of such
things as the word of God requireth of Pastors.</hi> But this is no
sufficient proof.</p>
               <p>For first, if he look into the Popes pontificall and Canons
he shall fynd they require also of theyr Priests and Bishops
to <hi>preach diligently, to administer the Sacraments, to oversee
theyr flock, and to execute the censures and discipline:</hi> And
consequently if his reason were good, the most popish priests
and Bishops should have the same office in substance with
the Pastors described in the word. Which doubtles he will
not affirme: or if he do let him take heed least with Mr Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fard
he prove himself a Schismatick from the Church of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ome, from whence they have derived theyr ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and yet pretend as if they made departure from that
Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he should have remembred, that distinction is to
be made between an office, and the actions or dutyes of an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
For it often commeth to passe, that many performe the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
of an office, who yet have not the office or substance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as he calleth it. To offer incense was a duty belonging to

likewise is a duty belonging to the<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 28. 18. 19. Ioh. 1. 25. 26. 33. 1 Cor. 1. 14. 16. 175. 1. a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d 3. 5. 6. 9. vvith Ephes. 4. 11 12.</note> Ministery of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell:

(as they call it): Yet I suppose Mr H. will not say
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17773:49"/>
that women therefore have the <hi>substance</hi> of the Ministery: of
whom the Scripture<note n="h" place="margin">1 Cor. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 34. 35. 1 Ti. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or allowing them to have the <hi>substance</hi> of the Ministery,
howsoever the Lawes of men allow them to performe some
action<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thereof. The same may be said of theyr Deacons, who
<note n="i" place="margin">Book of ordering Priests and Deacons:</note> by the Law are appoynted also to administer Baptisme,
and (having a licence) to preach the word. Yet have not their
Deacons therefore the substance of the Pastors office, though
they performe some of the dutyes thereof. By this then is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that his reason is of no waight to prove that their Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
is the same in substance with the Pastors office, <hi>because
by Law such dutyes are required to be done of it, as by the word
are enioyned to the other.</hi> As is sayd, an office is one thing, and
the actions or dutyes of the office another. Besides that it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
the Law at first supposing their Priesthood to be a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
office of Ministery, did therefore enioyne it those dutyes
to be performed thereyn: Whereas now it being found to be
vnlawfull, and altogether vnheard of in the Churches of the
Gospell, neyther the injoyning nor the executing of those du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes
can make it of vnlawfull to become lawfull before God
any maner way.</p>
               <p>3. But furthermore, doth not the Law of the Land req<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier
these same things of theyr Archbishops also? And have
they therefore the <hi>substance</hi> of the Pastors office? How then
will it be true which<note n="l" place="margin">D. VVhitg Last book against T. G. pag. 137.</note> some of them hold and write, <hi>that a

these also not according to the rules of Christs Testament, but

               <p>Herevnto might be added (if there needed further proof)

that theyr priests at theyr ordination promise to be subject to

other chief Ministers over them (that is, the Archdeacon
Chauncelor, Commissary etc.) and when they enter into a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice
do moreover sweare to yeeld canonicall obedience to
the Prelates: and finally do themselves together with theyr
people stand subject to theyr Archbishops, Lordbishops,
and the rest of the Antichristian offices and abominations of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

But be it that none of them were so ordeyned: What
then? Doth it follow therefore they are no Priests? If so,
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Leviticall priests vnder the Law were no priests. For
they were not ordeyned to sacrifice for the quick and dead: Yet
were they priests by office of ministery, and lawfully also at
that tyme as the<note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 28 1. Dent. 33. 10. vyith Le. 21. 1. Hos. 9. 4. Deut. 12. 11. 12.</note> Scripture teacheth. Neyther by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
are Mahumets priests at this day, or any priests of the

(as the popish priests) to offer vp Christ, whom they reiect:
Yet are they priests notwithstanding by theyr office (as we<note n="b" place="margin">Act. 14. 13.</note>

               <p>Secondly, although the <hi>Masse</hi> (whereto those popish priests

sacrifice and worship in the world. To let passe the
Heathens sacrifices and priesthood: what may we think (in

here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in theyr own consciences theyr book of Common prayer
is no other but a pigge of that mezeld sow the Masse book.
Yet this sacrifice do theyr Priests daily offer vp vnto God
and are bound therevnto. And that so, as among them this
may and doth serve alone without any theyr sermons or other
prayers, whereas these without it in theyr constitution are
not sufficient. Although then the Priests of England be not
now ordeyned to say Masse, neyther tyed to the Masse book
in Latin: yet when in stead thereof they are still bound to such
a book and worship, as (by theyr own confession) <hi>is culled and

what can this help for theyr defence? Nay rather

               <p>Thirdly, neyther is <hi>sacrificing</hi> the onely duty of the priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
in Popery: but besides it they have, by vertue of theyr

of England, wherevnto in this constitution they have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
by vertue of theyr ordination to that office, as have
the Priests in popery: What great matter is it, if agreing
with them in so many severall dutyes of the same office, they
should altogether differ from them in one? The Turkish
and Heathenish priests at this day, although they differ ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much both from those at Rome and these of England,
yet notwithstanding are they Priests in a false office, as
well as the other. Hitherto then hath ben showed that the
Ministers of these assemblyes are truly and fitly called
<hi>Priests.</hi> And Mayster H. himself who pleadeth theyr cause,
yet cannot (you see) deny, but <hi>they agree in Name with the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish

               </p>
               <p>Now whereas he addeth that <hi>though theyr Priesthood agree

why they retayne the same <hi>name,</hi> if they have not the same

they have not also the same <hi>name?</hi> In the history of Isaac

Hath the Lord said it, and shall he not do it? or hath he

that these men have the same <hi>name,</hi> if they have not the same

are the Priests of England. But so are not Pastors whom
Christ hath given to his Church. 2. Cor. 6. 15. 16. 17. Rev. 14. 9.

               <p>5. The popish priests in theyr constitution are inferior

               <p>6. The popish priests must be ordeyned to theyr office
by a Lordbishop or his Suffragane: So must also the Priests
of England. But so may not the Pastors of the Churches of

popish Law and priesthood, and such a disagreement of them
both from the Law of God and Pastors office prescribed
theyrin, as it can not but be discerned of all (whose eyes are not
blynded) that both the Pastors office differeth as much from
<hi>theyr priesthood</hi> as light doth from darknes, and that <hi>theyr
Priesthood</hi> in nature and substance agreeth with the popish as
daughters of one mother and fethers of one a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the same wing.</p>

evidently showeth the vnlawfulnes both of theyr of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and of theyr entrance into it. It is called thus, <hi>The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
and maner of making and consecrating Bishops, Priests, and
Deacons.</hi> Now if these offices, and this maner of entrance
were appoynted in the Testament of Christ: what need or vse
were there of this book and forme of theyrs? But because they
follow not the book of God a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the forme prescribed by Christ,
therefore have they framed to themselves this book and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
out of the Popes pontificall, and termed it as aforesayd.</p>
               <p>Now as is the title, so be also the contents of that book. By
it as likewise by theyr practise it appeareth, that theyr first of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Ministery is the <hi>Deaconship</hi> (not that auncient office
of Deacons appoynted by Christ, but) a meer invention of

imployed (according to<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 6. 2. 4. Rom. 12. 8. 1 Cor. 12. 28. and 16. 1. compared vvith Ephes. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and distributing the Churches benevolence: but contrary to
the word of God, in reading theyr books of common prayer
and Homilyes, in administring Baptisme, assisting the Priest
in divine service, and (with the Prelates licence) in preaching
the word. Secondly, at theyr entrance and calling into that
office, they must be presented by an Archdeacon (an Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
officer) or his deputy. Thirdly they must promise reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
obedience to theyr Ordinary and other chief Ministers
of the Church, that is to the Lordbishop of the Dioces, to
the Archbishop, Archdeacon, Chauncelor, Commissary, and
the rest of that sort (whose offices also are Antichristian).
Fourthly they must be ordeyned by a Lordbishop or his
Suffragane, whose office likewise is of Antichrist. Fiftly,
they must receyv the Communion with the Lordbishop that
day they are ordered. And thus must they testify that they ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aith and body with the Prelates, who are kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
to be deadly enemyes of the truth and persecuters of the
people of God. Sixtly, in stead of true prayer there must
be sayd or sung the Letany and Suffrages, with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Day and a number of Collects and stinted pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
borrowed from the Papists. Finally there must be read
a Gospell and Epistle (as they call theyr shredding of the
Scripture): in which they abuse and pervert the word of
God, falsely fathering vpon the Apostles an office of Deacon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
which they never ordeyned: that is, a Deaco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry whose
dutyes they assigne to be, to read publike prayer, to baptize,
to assist the Priest in divine service, and to preach, being licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
therevnto: Whereas neyther in the Apostles example nor
doctrine any such dutyes are layd vpon the Deacons, but such
as are directly<note n="b" place="margin">Act. 6. 2. 3. 4.</note> opposed to the Ministery of the word and
prayer, that is, the having charge of the poore and Church
treasure.<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 8.</note> Besides that into that office of Deacons prescribed
by the Apostles there is no such entrance as is aforesayd, but
a lawfull choyse and calling of a true Church according to the
word of God: as is recorded in the election of Deacons men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

And thus for theyr first office of Ministery it is manifest, that
neyther the office nor entrance into it is agreable to the Law
of God. Which themselves also have seen and publisht here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore:
Affirming that<note n="d" place="margin">Defence of Eccles. discip. p. 02.</note> theyr <hi>Deaconship is a meer huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

appeareth both by theyr book and practise) afore they can be

they must be ordeyned by a Prelate according to theyr book to

at theyr own suite, without any people to attend vpon, much

so, as the people where they are to minister never saw them

they bring, the people are most that can do least, even iust no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all: For priests they must and will be there, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the people will or not. Is this to have the Churches
choyse and approbation? Is this to follow the <hi>Law of GOD</hi>
and to have that in <hi>substance</hi> which the word prescribeth: as

               <p>But above all, it is most straunge that he would perswade vs

contradictory the one to the other. But to proceed, if it were
so as here he pretendeth, why then hath he with the rest of the

for an Eldership (consisting of Pastors, Teachers, and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders)

published, that <hi>not onely the office of Elders but theyr Name
also is out of this English Church vtterly removed, and that in
stead of them in every Church the Pope hath brought in and
they in England yet mainteyne the Lordship of one man over
many Churches, yea over sundry shires: Which Lordbishops
being not able (as the Elders) to execute theyr offices in theyr

Thus and much more have themselves written hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

then is <hi>the imposition of hands of the Eldership</hi> which
Mr H. would make vs beleev theyr Ministers have? Or is
<hi>the want now among them not of the offices of Elders, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of vpright Dealers</hi> therein, as here he would perswade?
Thus then you see that <hi>theyr Ministers having no other office

of the office or calling of Ministers which the vvord prescribeth,</hi>
whatsoever colour he pretend to the contrary.</p>
               <p>And yet (I pray you) what hath he said more for the
maner of calling to theyr Priesthood, then may be alledged
for the popish priests? For the Popes pontificall (out of
which theyr book is drawen) requireth the same things at
the entrance to the priesthood, which Mr H. alledgeth theyr
book doth: As, that <hi>they be of vnblameable life, apt to teach,
examined, allowed, ordered in a solemne assembly,</hi> and such li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke.
Yet I trow Mr H. will not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that the popish priests
have therefore the substance eyther of a true office or of a true
calling to the Ministery. Or if he should, yet will the conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Neyther let any think it straunge, that theyr book and
pontificall should have some things that the Law of GOd
hath, and yet that this should nothing help them for having a
true calling to the Minist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>shazar made a great feast to his
Princes, he commaunded that the <hi>golden and siluer vessels that
were taken out of the Temple of the Lords house at Ierusalem
should be brought, and the king and his Princes, his wines and
his concubynes drank therein.</hi> Now although they had there
the vessels of the Lords house and drank in them, yet was it
not therefore a feast of the Lord, but a feast of Babylon not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding.
Even so it fareth with the Ministery and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into it, vsed in England and among the Papists: Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
which although theyr book and pontificall have taken
some things out of the scripture (as it were some of the Lords
vessels out of his Temple) yet inasmuch as they are applyed
by them to a false office, ordination, and ministration never
appoynted by Christ but invented by Antichrist (even as it
were in a Caldean banket), they do no more make theyr
Priesthood or calling vnto it to be the Ministery and calling
ordeyned by Christ, then those vessels taken out of the LOrds
house made that banquet of Babylon to be one of the Lords
<note n="d" place="margin">of vvhich read Levit. 23.</note> feasts. Likewise in the prophecy of Ezechiel we are taught
that albeit men set <hi>theyr thresholds by Gods thresholds a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their

                     </gap>ch. 43. 8,</note> theyr inventions by Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances)
yet it maketh them not therefore to be the house and
Temple of God and to have his true worship and ministery
among them: but as the Lord there testifyeth by his Prophet,
by this meanes they <hi>set a wall between God and themselues and
defile his holy Name with theyr abominations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the account the Lord maketh of the ioyning of
his ordinances with mans inventions: And what then will
it help the Priests of England or Rome, that theyr book and
Law requier some things that the word of God prescribeth,
seing they ioyne and apply them to a false ministery devised by
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? It may in deed make the mist which through theyr delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
they cast before the eyes of the people to be far the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
but it can no way iustify theyr standing or lessen theyr sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.
Nay rather it doth increase it, because thus they prohaue
the word of God and defile his holy Name, and cause them to

me to seek a calling from them, and vvhat persvvadeth me to think that the

               <p>First, being persvvaded in my conscience that the Lord had a true Church in this
Realme even at the beginning of her Maiestyes raigne, vvhich being assembled
out of all the parts of the Land in Parliament, did commit this authority to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyne

vvith my self that though the Church offended in committin-this povver

might vvithout sinne seek and take the Churches ordination at theyr hands: as
I may reverence and take the benefit of the Princes povver and authority vvhich
is of God, though it be committed vnto and exercised by men that by the Lavv of

We need not aske him (as here he deviseth an obiection with

the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of a true calling, seyng they wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t these substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiall

as theyr own estate testifyeth agaynst them to theyr faces. Yea
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> H himself vp his own words here importeth thus much,
that divers at least of their ministers wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of a true
calling. Els (when he aunswereth to his own objection) why
saith he, <hi>Many</hi> Ministers in the Land have these substantiall
parts: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d sayth not, that <hi>all</hi> theyr Ministers have them? <hi>Many</hi>
he sayth, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not all. Thus to vphold some of theyr Ministers
(if he could), he careth not to smite down others of them to the
ground: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d those also such, as have the same Ministery a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with the rest, which is prescribed by Law. But compare
this with that which he wrote, and see what a fayre thred he
hath spun for himself. <hi>Al theyr Ministers have not the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of
a true calling:</hi> This he insinuateth here, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in his own vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding
of the substantiall parts set down by himself cannot deny
it if he would. Yet all theyr Ministers be made <hi>Priests or Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
or both, by the Prelates, according to theyr book afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd:</hi>
This also he yeelded<note n="l" place="margin">Section. 9.</note> before, neyther if he would can
deny it. The conclusion therefore must be this, that the <hi>Priests
and Deacons so made by the Prelates according to theyr book</hi>
(such as be all theyr Ministers) <hi>have not the substance of a
true calling to the Ministery.</hi> This you see followeth vpon his
own aunswers: Besides that we omit to speak of theyr pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations,
and of theyr inductions by the Prelates, which
the Law appoynteth as substantiall parts of theyr calling
when they take charge of soules. Onely marke here agayn his
contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with himself, whiles he stribeth against the truth.</p>
               <p>Now to proceed, let him tell vs whom he meaneth here by
<hi>the learned and godly whose examination and approbation they
are to have, and on whose judgment they may safely rely in that
matter.</hi> If he meane the Archdeacon or other Priests that be
examiners for the Prelates (as theyr Law and vse is): how
will he prove that they are such as he sayth, that is, learne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and godly? or that theyr examination and approbation was
ever appoynted by Christ, or is to be had as a substautiall part
of true calling to the Ministery? or finally, that any may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rely vpon theyr iudgment in this matter? But if he meane
(as doubtles he doth) the examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and approbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of some
of the forward Preachers amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them: himself knoweth, first
that the Law appoynteth it not: wherevpon will follow by
his own assertion that all the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiall parts of a true calling
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:17773:64"/>
to the ministery are not prescribed by Law, which yet<note n="m" place="margin">Section 9.</note> befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
he labored to prove. Secondly he is not ignorant, and theyr
constitution and practise showeth it, that although secretly (it
may be) some of them are tryed a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d approved by such as here he
inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, yet neyther is this generall, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d those also which have
this, have notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d must have that other which law
binds vnto. Now if that after the Law be of Christ, why have
they the other? If it be not of Christ, why receyv they it at all,
or how is it true which he sayd (<note n="m" place="margin">Section 9.</note>) before, that their Law agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with the Law of God, as towching the substance of a true
calling to the Ministery? Thirdly, are not these forward prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
also (aswell as the other) Deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and Priests, so ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Prelates as aforesayd: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therefore have a Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
never ordeyned by Christ, but brought in by Antichrist? And
what priviledg them have they herein more then the other? Or
how will it be proved for them, any more then for the other,
that thus standing their examination and allowance is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of Christ, or substantiall part of true calling to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery?
Or that any may safely rely themselves vpon theyr
judgment in this matter?</p>
               <p>For the next likewise, that is, <hi>the choyse a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d approbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the
people that they are to be set over:</hi> if he meane it generally of any
people whatsoever, whether Idolaters, Atheists, Papists, or
others standing subject to Antichrist, or such like: how will he
ever prove that such have this power and authority of Christ,
to choose the Ministers of his Gospell? Or if he meane it (as
needs he must if he speak to the purpose) of such people as by
the word of God be called a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d separated from the world, ioyned
in covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d fellowship of the Gospell, being true visible Chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches
of Christ: then also how will it ever be proved that theyr
people in this theyr Church constitution (as now they stand in
confusion a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d spirituall bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage to Antichrists Ministery, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, courts, and jurisdiction), are such people and
Churches, having the power a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d liberty which Christ hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to his Church for trying a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d chusing their own Ministers
according to the rules of his Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? Is it possible that they
which sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in subjectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Antichrist, should also be the freemen
of Iesus Christ? Or that the priviledges of Christs Church
should belong vnto and be found in the Synagogues of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ?
<note n="n" place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 14. 15. 16.</note> Christ a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Belial ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not agree together. 2. But yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what choyse a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d allowa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is it that they pretend to have of
the people? Is it not a secret gathering of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of some few
in the towne or parish? And ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this interest them to the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
of the soules of the whole towne or parish, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> most of them
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17773:65"/>
neyther give theyr consent nor have it asked. But it may be
he will say, they dare not trust any herein but some few, or
that they account them not to be godly mynded. Yet dare they
Minister the Sacraments to them all, and receyv them and
theyr seed as members of the Church, and take maintenance
from them as from the Church. Is this to walk vprightly
before the Lord, and to go with an even foot to the truth of the
Gospell, 3. But be it that all the people gave theyr consent:
yet whom and whereto do they chuse? Chuse they not one that
eyther is already, or before he can minister to them must be
made, Deacon or Priest or both by a Lordbishop? who also
must in that Ministery administer to them theyr holy things
according to theyr book of Common prayer and other theyr
Canons and constitutions? Now that such a choyse and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
is a <hi>substantiall part of true calling,</hi> who ever can
perswade or be perswaded? 4. Or doth theyr Law appoynt
and allow this choyse and approbation of the people for law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and sufficient? Who is it that knoweth not the contrary?
For whether it be had, or not, the Law requireth and they
must have theyr ministery from the Prelates, and when they
take cure of soules, the Patrones presentation, and the Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
induction into the benefice. And this onely is that which
standeth for sufficient in theyr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Law and constitution. Hence
therefore agayn appeareth even by his own assertion (contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to that which<note n="*" place="margin">Section, 9.</note> before he would have proved) that <hi>the
Lavv appoynteth not the substance of a true calling to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery,
neyther agreeth vvith the Lavv<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of God therein:</hi> foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as not onely it appoynteth not the peoples choyse
(which<note n="o" place="margin">Act. 6. 2 3. 5. and 14. 23. and 1. 15. 23. 26. 2 Cor. 8. 19. Ezech. 33. 2. Num. 8. 9. 1 Cor. 16. 3.</note> Gods word requireth) but in stead thereof enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
presentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by a Patrone (be he Papist, Atheist, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever)
and induction by a Lordbishop: which God never
commaunded, but was and is retayned from the Popes Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
custome, and pontificall. 5. Moreover, if the peoples
choyse and approbation be the true choyse and calling (as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
he graunteth): why then do they take that other of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones
and Prelates, never appoynted by Christ, but forged
by Antichrist? Is it because they would have all men know,
that in theyr constitution<note n="p" place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 3. 4.</note> the man of sinne is exalted abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
God and his holy ordinances? Or because they would have
it seen of all, that they<note n="q" place="margin">Ezech. 43. 8.</note> set theyr thresholds by Gods thres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds,
that they may defile his Name? Will they never lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
that<note n="r" place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 14. 15. 16.</note> Christ and Antichrist, light and darknes, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have fellowship and concord together? To end this poynt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:17773:65"/>
then, seing the peoples choyse (by his own confession) is a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall
part of true calling to the Ministery (and this is to
be vnderstood of such people onely as be the true visible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Christ, and theyr people in theyr estate can not by the
word of God be accounted such, but in deed to stand in spiriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
slavery to Antichrist) it is evident they neyther have, nor
as they stand can have, <hi>the substance of a true calling to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
of the Gospell of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Towching the last substantiall part he assigneth, which is
<hi>a right ordination into theyr office:</hi> if he meane of that which
is had from the Prelates (which onely the Law appoynteth)
how will he prove it to be a substantiall part of true calling to
the Ministery? Specially, it being no ordinance of Christ but
part of Antichrists apostasy, as hath ben showed<note n="*" place="margin">Sec <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 6. 8. 9.</note> before: and
seing also the power of ordination is such as by the Law of
God the Prelates are not capable thereof: as him self here
graunteth and affirmeth in playne words. If he meane of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
other besides to be had among them (not from the Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
but) from some of theyr forward Preachers: then first
he is to mynd that here agayn he crosseth himself, beause ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this a substantiall part of true calling, and the Law not
appoynting it (as it doth not), it followes herevpon that <hi>the
Law prescribeth not the substance of a true calling to the Minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery:</hi>
Which before he affirmed. 2. Agayn, if this be so, what
becometh of all the Ministers in the Land that have not this
other ordination, but that onely of the Prelates and Priests
present as the Law appoynteth, neyther have the choyse of
the people, nor examination and allowance of the Learned a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
godly he speaketh of? All such by his own account have not
the substance of a true calling: and therefore cannot be true
Ministers: for these three he saith are <hi>substantiall parts</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Now in the Land there be an hundred of these for one of
the other. Is not theyr Ministery (think you) well holye vp
by this meanes? 3. Nay and what one of them all that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to have this other, dare stand forth before theyr LOrds
the Prelates, and avow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h theyr Ministery by vertue thereof?
When they come before them, they can show theyr letters of
Orders receyved from them: howsoever before theyr follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
(to mislead them) they colour the matter otherwise.
4. Furthermore, have not these forward Preachers themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
receyved theyr Ministery from the Prelates and retayne
it still vnto this day? How then can a right ordination pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
be had from such? Who can<note n="s" place="margin">Iob. 14. 4</note> bring a cleane thing out

should be had from the Ministers and apostasy of Antichrist?
Eyther is this vtterly to leave a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d forsake (which we<note n="v" place="margin">Esa. 52. 11. Rev. 18. 4. 2 Cor. 6. 17.</note> ought)

and abominations of Antichrist that sonne of perdition?</p>
               <p>It remayneth then, that theyr calling to the Ministery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
examined by these particulars, which Mr H. himself hath
here assigned to be <hi>substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiall parts of a true calling:</hi> they neyther
have, neyther whiles they thus stand, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> have, a true calling to
the Ministery of the Gospell. Thus well hath he reasoned for
theyr calling, and aunswered the obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> framed by himself.</p>
               <p>Now in his writing there followeth another obiection, with
his aunswer therevnto: Whereyn he pleadeth agayn with as
yll successe as before. The obiection is this, that <hi>it is affirmed
they come in by the Bishops, who are the limmes of Antichrist.</hi>
The obiection suerly is of waight, and had need be soundly
aunswered. For if the Prelates be the limmes of Antichrist, and
they also come into theyr Ministery by them, it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
but <hi>theyr Ministery (by vertue whereof they deale with the
holy things of God, and work vpon mens consciences) is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian:
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therefore not to be receyved or ioyned vnto:</hi> Which
is the thing that was to be proved. What is it then that he
saith herevnto? Doth he deny that the Prelates be limmes of
Antichrist, and prove the contrary by the Scripture? No in
deed: but he leaveth them as he found them, <hi>the limmes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist:</hi>
and seemeth so astonyed partly at the truth on the one
hand, partly with the vnlawfulnes of theyr office on the other
as notwithstanding they are thus deeply charged, yet he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
not the charge but rather yeelds vnto it, saying, that <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>soever
is vnlawfull in theyr callings he will not go about to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne:</hi>
Yea, that <hi>by Law of God they are not capable of that
which is committed vnto them by the Parliament.</hi> Where besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
that he leaveth them without defence against so waighty
an accusation, he doth himself also charge them with breach of
Gods Law and vnlawfulnes in theyr callings: and so yeelds
vs the cause. The Prelates and his fellow Priests will not
thank him for this. And sure if any way it could have ben do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
now was it altogether needfull to have convinced by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Scripture, both that the Prelates are not the limmes
of Antichrist, and that theyr offices and callings are lawfull.
But the truth is mighty, and will prevayle against all that
withstand it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ll they, will they.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:17773:66"/>
Well then, leaving thus <hi>the Prelates to be limmes of Antichrist,</hi>
what saith he to the other, which is, that <hi>the Ministers of the
land come into theyr Ministery by the Prelates?</hi> Doth he deny
this? No, but graunteth it also, as needs he must. For such is
theyr constitution and practise: Besides that if any standing
Ministers of these assemblyes should enter otherwise, they
could not but be intruders and hypocrites. Intruders, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
they should thrust themselves into theyr Ministery eyther
by no calling, or by other then is receyved and allowed in theyr
Church: Hypocrites, because ministring in and to these assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyes
they should seem vnto men to do it by vertue of such cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
as is appoynted by Law of theyr Church, when in deed
it were otherwise. It cannot be denyed then but they do and
must come in by the Prelates, who are limmes of Antichrist.
Now what followeth herevpon, let themselves and all that
partake with them well consider and repent, whiles<note n="x" place="margin">Heb. 3. 7. &amp;c.</note> it is
called To day.</p>
               <p>But saith Mr H. nothing in this poynt at all? Yes: though
he leave the Prelates and other Priests to shift for themselves
yet for himself he takes a litle paynes: saying, he <hi>will simply a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
playnely set down what moved him to seek a calling from the
Prelates, and what perswadeth him to think the calling he recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from them is not vvicked and vnlavvfull.</hi> Well: but what
if the other Ministers of the Land (who take themselves to
have as a good a calling as he, yet) were not moved neyther
are perswaded therevnto by these reasons wherevpon he res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th?
what now will he, and what must we account of theyr
Ministery by this reckoning? Agayn, what if the reasons he
alledgeth for himself be not of waight in this case so to move
and perswade eyther him or any other? How then will he
have vs esteem of his calling and Ministery? Let vs therefore
examine his reasons. But first mark that he saith, <hi>he sought a
calling from the Prelates and receyved it.</hi> He was not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sought
spyed out, and called by a Church (as is the<note n="y" place="margin">Heb. 5. 4. vvith Act. 6. 2. 3. 5. and 14. 23. Ezech 33. 2. 2 Cor. 8. 19.</note> ordinance of
Christ) but himself, he saith, <hi>sought to be called by the Prelates,
and receyved his calling from them.</hi> Which maner of calling se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is such as God never ordeined, it therefore neither might
be receyved of him, neyther may be ioyned vnto by any other.
But let vs see what moved him herevnto.</p>
               <p>FIrst (saith Mr H.) being persvvaded in my conscience that the Lord had a true
Church in this Realme even at the beginning of her Maiestyes raigne, vvhich
being assembled out of all parts of the Land in Parliament did commit this
authority to ordeyne Ministers vnto the Bishops: and knovving out of the
vvord of GOD that every true Church hath this povver and authority to ordeyne
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:17773:67"/>
Ministers: I considered vvith my self, that though the Church offended in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
this povver vnto them that by the Lavv of God vvere not capable of it,
yet I might vvithout sinne seek and take the Churches ordination at theyr hands:
as I may reverence and take the benefit of the Princes povver a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d authority vvhich
is of God, though it be committed vnto and exercised by men that by the Lavv
of God are not capable of it.</p>
               <p>THis is Mr H. his first and chief reason. Wherein (as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in the rest following) let this be observed generally, that
although in the<note n="*" place="margin">Section, 1. Pag. 1.</note> beginning of his letter he promised no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
should be brought to perswade, but the word of GOd,
yet now in stead thereof he setteth before vs the perswasions
of his conscience (Which is a thing very vsuall among them):
as if they were eyther divine oracles, or as foroible to perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
as they. Yea, here he seemeth to prefer his perswasions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Gods oracles: (Which if he had not done, I would
not thus have noted it). For confessing on the one hand, that
he <hi>knoweth out of the word of God that every true Church hath
this power and authority to ordeyne Ministers</hi> (and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that it is Gods ordinance to have it in and from a true
Church, as he hath appoynted): yet on the other hand he
professeth, that <hi>the Parliament committing this power vnto
such as by the Law of God are not capable of it,</hi> to wit, to the
Prelates (and so offending therein), he notwithstanding vpon
his perswasion <hi>sought and took ordination from the Prelates
hands.</hi> Now what was this els, but to regard his own pers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wasion
more then the word of God? Specially, when he ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
withall, that he <hi>thought he might so do without sinne.</hi>
Sure, this is straunge divinity. The Scripture teacheth, that
we<note n="z" place="margin">1 Tim. 5 22.</note> 
                  <hi>may not be partakers of other mens sinnes:</hi> And, that<note n="a" place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 4.</note>
                  <hi>the transgression of Gods Law is sinne.</hi> He notwithstanding
thought that he might partake with others in the breach of
Gods ordinance, and yet not sinne. I hope he is otherwise
mynded synce, and so will be every day more and more. In
the meane tyme it is cleare, that though these very things
which he would seem to rest vpon were all graunted him, yet
they make altogether agaynst him: and so this first reason of
his is found in this case to be of no waight. Yet before we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the rest, it will not be amisse for more evidence of the
truth more fully to consider the particulars here set down.</p>
               <p>1 And first where he sayth <hi>he is perswaded the Lord had a
true Church in this Realme at the beginning of her Majestyes
raigne &amp;c.</hi> it would be knowen whether he speak of invisible
or of a visible Church of God. If he speak of invisible, he
speaketh not to the poynt in question: besides that they could
not be counted an invisible Church, and yet be knowen to be
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17773:67"/>
assembled together in Parliament. If he speak of a visible
Church (as he must if he will speak to the purpose, and as it
seemeth he meaneth because he sayth they were then assembled
together) then how doth he prove this to be so? In deed we
deny not but God had his flock and Church even a true visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church in this Land at the beginning of her Majestyes
raigne: For we have heard and read that in Queen Maryes
dayes there was here a Congregation of faythfull people sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the rest of the Land and gathered into fellowship
together to serve the LORD according to his word, and
to keep themselves pure from the abominations of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ:
That this Congregation also chuse them Ministers,
Elders, and Deacons, to instruct guyde and serve them in the
Lord: and that they had theyr holy meetings, and showed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
testimonyes of their faith and love. So long then as they
kept communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this way, we deny not but they were a true
visible Church: though (it may be) in some defects through
want of further light and instruction. The like we think also
of our countreymen that were then at Frankford, Geneva,
and other where beyond seas. But when Queen Mary dyed,
and Queen Elizabeth (whom God long preserve) came to the
Crown, then the Masse and some other superstitions of pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
being abolished, agaynst which these Congregations had
witnessed the truth in much affliction, they herevpon dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and the severall members scattered themselves to theyr
parishes here and there throughout the Land: commingling
themselves in confusion with the rest of the land that were I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters
and repented not: and submitting theyr soules to the
Prelates and to the Ministery receyved from and executed
vnder them: as also to theyr courts, canons, excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and other Antichristian jurisdiction retayned in the
Land: And so have continued in apostasy from the way of
Christ vnto this day. Now these Congregations being thus
dissolved, and the members there of thus standing: they were
not now any lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger true visible Churches in the order of Christ,
but fallen into confusion with the world and into spirituall
bondage to the Prelates and other Clergy the limmes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist.
So as from hence for the poynt in hand M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> H. can
derive no help for himself.</p>
               <p>But be it that they had remayned still visible Churches in
true constitution, and had <hi>assembled together and committed
this authority of ordination to the Prelates:</hi> Yet this being not
warrantable by the word of God, it had bound no mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:17773:68"/>
neyther ben sufficient warrant for any to partake in
theyr sinnes. For the sinfull actions of the Church do not bynd
or warrant vs any more, then the sinfull actions of the world:
Neyther can all Churches or Nations vnder heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make that
lawfull, which God by his word maketh vnlawfull. Though

therevnto, but sinned in so doing: as they also did that tooke
part thereyn. Agayne (for example sake) let vs suppose that
which in deed was not, to wit, that Moses and Aaron and all
that were famous in the Congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea that the whole Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

what tolerable: as may appeare by the examples and insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces

The same Parliament whereof he speaketh, authorising the

capable of it?</hi> Many mo particulars might be alledged of like
nature both out of the Scriptures and Lawes of this and
other Nations: but for the matter in hand the former allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may suffice.</p>
               <p>2. Next where Mr H. sayth, <hi>that at the beginning of her
Maiestyes raigne the Parliament committed this authority to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyne
Ministers to the Bishops:</hi> he mistaketh the matter, if he
think that then first they receyved it. For the authority of <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination</hi>
was not then first committed vnto the Prelates, but
continued to them from former tymes: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ratifyed vnto them
both at that tyme and afterward agayne in the eyght yeare of
her Highnes raigne, as may appeare by the<note n="*" place="margin">Anno. 1. Eliz. cap. 1. and 8. Eliz. cap. 1.</note> statu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es then
enacted. Which it seemeth the Prelates and Priests of the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
desired, because theyr offices and authority being called into
question, they were not able to bring warrant for them out of
the Law of God, and therefore got what strength they could
from the Law of Man. The truth then is, that not at <hi>the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of her Majestyes raigne,</hi> but hundreds of yeares before
her Majesty was borne, the Prelates had this power of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in theyr hands as much as now they have. For who
knoweth not that both their offices and callings and this their
authority of <hi>ordination</hi> is part of the<note n="g" place="margin">2 Thes. 2 3. Rev. 9. 1. 2 3.</note> apostasy of the Man

                  </gap>e made drunken the nations of the earth, and
this of England among the rest? Many of which abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
we confesse have ben swept out of this Land both in the
tyme of King Henry the eyght, and of King Edward the sixt,
a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of Elizabeth our dread Soveraigne: For which we prayse
God. Yet notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding (to speak as the truth is) many also
of those <hi>abominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Babylo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> are remayning in the La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, from
which it was never purged u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to this day: Of which sort are the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17773:69"/>
offices, callings, administration, and maintenance, both of the
Prelacy and other clergy yet retayned in the Land, from the
hyest Prelate to the lowest Priest, together with theyr
book worship, canons, compulsion and confusion of all
sorts of people whatsoever to be members of theyr Church
and such like which were long to relate in particular.</p>
               <p>So then if Mr H. would have simply and plainely showed
vnto vs the originall of this power and authority in the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,</hi>
he should have led vs, not to the beginning of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestyes
raigne (as if it had then begun) but to the apostasy of
the man of sinne: from whence it first sprang and spred abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad
into this and other Nations of the earth, many ages before
her Highnes raigne or birth. Neyther hath it hitherto ben a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished
out of this land, as it ought: but being found here
at the beginning of her Maiestyes raigne, was left remayning
still, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is not suppressed but retayned eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto this day. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is come to passe, that the Prelates a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Priests retayning
still theyr calling and authority, have by the iust iudgment of
God showed themselves to be nothing behind the<note n="i" place="margin">Num. 33. 55. Iosua 23. 13. vvith Iudg. 1. cap, and 3. 4.</note> Canani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
Hivites, Iebusites, and other inhabitants of the Nations
whom God commaunded Israel to drive out before them, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
they notwithstanding let them still remayne among them:
that is, they are become pricks in our eyes and thornes in
our sides, vexing all such as feare God in the Land: and it is
to be feared (if Gods mercy be not the greater) will be a snare
and destruction to the Land, as already they are to the soules
and consciences of the people therein.</p>
               <p>The Lord stir vp the royall heart of her Maiesty, that
she may discerne theyr iniquity and abolish theyr offices and
callings out of the Land, and make them desolate and naked,
eating theyr flesh, even theyr revennewes and poffessions, by
converting them to her own civill vses and the weale publik
of the Land. Thesame God, the King of Kings, work it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in the hearts of the other Princes and Magistrates of the
world, that they may do likewise within theyr Dominions:
that so the most wicked Hierarchy and religion of Antichrist
may be vtterly consumed from of the earth, and the Gospell
of Iesus Christ may have free passage a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d be glorifyed among
all nations to the ends of the world: as the Scripture hath
said shall come to passe. <hi>Rev. 17. 16. and 18. 20. 21. and 14. 6. 7.
8. and 21. 15. 24. 26. with 2 Thes. 2. 8. and 3. 1. Mat.</hi> 24. 14.</p>
               <p>3 Thirdly where Mr H. saith, he <hi>knew out of the word
of God that every true Church of GOD hath the power and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:17773:69"/>
authority to ordeyne Ministers,</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that <hi>the Prelates by the Lavv
of God are not capable of it, and yet that he sought and took or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
of the Prelates:</hi> this is so far from being any defence
vnto him in this case, as it doth rather manifest his sinne to be
the greater and far more grievous: inasmuch as hereby it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
he took ordination of the Prelates, against the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
which he had out of the word of God to the contrary.</p>
               <p>4. Fourthly let it be observed, that here he saith <hi>the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
offended in committing the povver and authority
of ordination to the Prelates, that by the Law of God are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of it:</hi> and yet before he affirmed, that <hi>theyr Law agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with the Law of GOD as towching the substance of a true
calling to the Ministery,</hi> of which he made <hi>right ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be a part.</hi> Thus he both contradicteth himself, and
agayn yeeldeth the cause. For if they offended against the Law
of God in committing this power to the Prelates (as he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
affirmeth) and there is no other Ministery had and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed
in the Land but from the Prelates (as there is not):
hence it must needs follow, that theyr calling and Ministery is
vnlawfull, and neyther to be receyved nor joyned vnto.</p>
               <p>5. Fiftly, where he calleth the ordination taken from the
Prelates, <hi>the Churches ordination receyved at their hands:</hi> and
yet before sayd, <hi>the Church hath power to ordeyne,</hi> but <hi>the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
by the Law of God are not capable of it:</hi> here agayne he
forgetteth and contradicteth himself.</p>
               <p>6. Finally, it may be observed that in the shutting vp
of this reason he speaketh of the <hi>Princes power and authority
committed to men that by the Law of God are not capable of it,</hi>
when as before in the former part of the reason he had spoken
of the <hi>Churches power and authority committed to such as by
the Law of God are not capable of it.</hi> Thus he keepeth not to
the poynt in question: but speaking of ordination of Minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
one while he caryeth vs to the <hi>Churches</hi> power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
committed to men not capable thereof, another while
to the <hi>Princes</hi> power, so likewise committed: As if the power
and authority of <hi>Princes</hi> and of the <hi>Church</hi> were all one a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not
distinct in the ordinance and appoyntment of God: or as if
whatsoever may be done in the one, were also to be admitted
in the other. What straunge consequences would follow here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon,
let himself consider. And hitherto of the insufficiency of
his first reason. Now let vs see if there be any more wayght in
his second: which is as followeth.</p>
               <p>SEcondly (<hi>sayth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> H.</hi>) seyng it is not to be refused, if a man entring into the
Ministery might have the approbation of all and every one of the Ministers of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:17773:70"/>
the Gospell in the land: it seemeth vnto me the approbation of that Bishop that
is also a Minister and preacher of the Gospell cannot be deemed to be meerly
vnlavvfull.</p>
               <p>1. BVt what if the <hi>Bishops and Ministers</hi> he speaketh of be
not the Bishops and Ministers of Christ, but of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist?
not in a true, but in a false Ministery? not according
to Christs Gospell, but Antichrists apostasy? not servants of
Iesus Christ the onely LOrd and head of his Church, but
Lords themselves over the Ministers a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d people vnder them?
Will it not then seem to Mr H. that the ordination receyved
from them cannot otherwise be deemed but meerly vnlawfull?
But such have they ben proved to be both in this and<note n="*" place="margin">Refucati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mr Gyfford, printed, 1591. Discovery of the false Church, 1590.

noted before) that</hi> they have an Antichristian Hierarchy and
popish ordering of Ministers straunge from the vvord of God
and the vse of all vvell reformed Churches in the vvorld.</p>
               <p>Thus have they thought, and thus have they publis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
heretofore. Let M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> H. therefore dispute the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
with them. And if he or any other cannot with pacyen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
heare the truth of vs, let them yet be content to heare and
take it in good part at the hands of these men of whom they
have no such prejudice. And then see whether it have or can
have so much as any colour of truth; that <hi>the Prelates</hi> should
be Ministers of the Gospell: or that <hi>ordination</hi> may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyved
from them, who are not members (much lesse offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers)
of the body of Christs Church: these men themselves
beyng witnesses. (Not to speak here of the testimony of former
tymes: For which see the<note n="*" place="margin">Act. and Monum. edit. 4. Pag. 150. 468. 562. 563. 639.</note> hystoryes of Iohn Wickleff, Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Swinderby, the Lord Cobham, Iohn Claydon etc.)</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, let it herevpon agayne be noted, how
wavering and vnstable these men are in all theyr wayes: as if
IEsus Christ were Yea and Nay, and not<note n="q" place="margin">Heb. 13. 8. vvith 2 Cor. 1. 19. 20</note> one and the
same yesterday, to day, and for ever. Heretofore they<note n="r" place="margin">In theyr treatises be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note>
published that <hi>the Prelates vvere not Pastors not Teachers, nor
members of the body of CHRISTS CHVRCH: but that
theyr offices callings and government vvere Antichristian,
divelish, and contrary to the Scriptures.</hi> But now behold,
they account the <hi>PRELATES to be MINISTERS of the
GOSPELL.</hi> Is it not piteous to see them thus halt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two opinions: and to vse such lightnes in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matters
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:17773:71"/>
of God, as that theyr word should thus be Yea and
Nay, and themselves like reeds shaken with every wynd and
clouds caryed about with every tempest? Let them take heed
least whiles thus they dally with the Lord, he take them in
theyr own crafty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es and bring vpon them that which is<note n="s" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 13.</note>
written, <hi>The evill men and deceyvers shall wax worse and worse,
deceyving and being deceyved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, see here agayn how they take for graunted
that which they should prove: to wete, that the <hi>Prelates are
Ministers of the Gospell.</hi> For this is the poynt in controversy:
they being charged not onely not to be such, but to be <hi>limmes
of Antichrist, standing in</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">2 Thes. 2 3. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>apostasy from the way and Gospell</hi>
of Christ: yea adversaryes against and exalted above the Lord
and his holy ordinances.</p>
               <p>4. Fourthly, if they were true Ministers, yet it were an
endles work (and without all rule or example in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
for <hi>a man entring into the Ministery to seek the approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all and every one of the Ministers of an whole land.</hi> And
yet if this were to be had, it would make the more against
Mr H. who would onely seek for the approbation of some one
(as here he reasonath) d passe by all the rest of the Land, who
notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding by this meanes should have as much interest
therein as the other.</p>
               <p>5 Lastly, it is to be mynded here, how he turneth away
from the question and matter in hand: telling vs of <hi>approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
when he should speak of <hi>ordination.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
very well. And hitherto of his second <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>
in peace) coming to the Bishop by Act of Parliament, I may more boldly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
to him for his approbation in regard of the Lavv: not looking so much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Man, as regarding vvith reverence the povver of the Lavv and Christian
Magistrate.</p>
               <p>THis is Mr H. his third and last reason (as also the last
words of his letter that came to my hands): For aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
whereof let it be remembred, how before in his first rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
he confessed (as the truth is) that <hi>the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>lates by the Lavv
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:17773:71"/>
of God are not capable of this povver and authority to ordeyn
Ministers, vvhich is committed vnto them by Act of Parliament:</hi>
Yet notwithstanding here he saith, that <hi>in regard of the Lavv
and Christian Magistrate he may more boldly come to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
for it.</hi> As if the authority of Man could make that law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
which God hath made vnlawfull. What els is this, but
to advaunce Mans Law above Gods, and to exalt flesh and
blood above the Lord himself: who is God over al blessed for
ever, Amen. Straunge doubtles is that Ministery and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arfull
is that standing, which cannot otherwise be vpholden
then by making God (by whom Princes raigne) to stoupe
vnto Man, whose breath is in his nostrils. The Prophets,
Apostles, and Christ himself have taught vs otherwise, that
<note n="v" place="margin">Psal. 2. 10. 11. 12. Deut. 28. 58. Esa. 66. 23. Zech. 2. 13. Luk. 12. 5. Heb. 12. 28. 29.</note> all flesh even Kings and Princes as well as others ought

and that<note n="x" place="margin">Esa, 60. 12.</note> the nation and Kingdome which will
not serve him, shall perish and be vtterly destroyed. Therefore
should Mr H. eyther have showed this Law and ordinance of
the Magistrates to be agreable to the Law and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of God (which he doth not): or finding it otherwise
as himself confesseth it to be, he should with the Apostles ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
said and showed in his practise, that<note n="y" place="margin">Act. 5. 29.</note>

religion or whatsoever thing in religion is ordeyned by
the Law and Magistrate: what were this els, but to make
thery State and kingdome such an Idoll as was Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezars

King and to annihilate the Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Iesus Christ
confirmed in that this precious blood?</p>
               <p>If he except and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

here of <hi>Christian Magistrates</hi> onely, and not of Magis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates

appoynted for the punishing of them that do evill, and for the
defence and comfort of them that do well. So that although
a Christian do and cannot but differ from an Heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
the faith and religion they professe: yet as towching
the nature and authority of Magistracy they differ not. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath the one of them any more power then the other, in
religion to erect any other faith, Ministery, worship, or
constitution of a Church, then God himself who is King of

Kings hath ordeyned: Or if they do, we are not bound to
obey eyther of them thereyn: but alwayes to remember that
we must yeeld obedience to Magistrates (whether Christian
or Heathen) onely in the Lord. and never against the LOrd,
Constantine the Emperour had no greater nor other power
and authority of Magistracy when he became a Christian,
then he had before when he was an Heathen: Neyther might
he now any more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before adde to, diminish, or alter the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
and ordinances of IEsus Christ. The same may be said
of all others likewise. For the receyving and profession of the
faith of Christ giveth not to Princes and Rulers any power
to refuse chaunge or break his Lawes and ordinances, which
he as Lord and head of his Church hath commaunded to be
receyved therein: but it rather<note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 2. 10. 11. 12. Esa. 49. 23. and 60. 3. 2 Chron. 29 and 30. and 31. and 34. and 35. cap. Revel. 21. 24.</note> byndeth them so much

and commaundements given by Moses, then did they and
theyr kingdomes prosper through the blessing of God. The
same is to be brought and said of <hi>Christian</hi> Princes and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
at this day: Yea rather more of these then of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
inasmuch as Christ IEsus<note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 3. 1. 2. 3.</note> the Apostle and high
Priest of our profession hath ben faithfull to him that appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him, even as was Moses in all his house: and <hi>being the
Sonne is covnted worthy of more honour the Moses the servant.</hi>
Neyther is it or can be any disparagement hindrance or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
to Princes and Potentates for themselves and theyr
people to be subiect to the Sonne of God and his ordinances,
who is King of kings and Lord of Lords, set at the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

               </p>
               <p>Thus have we seen the weaknes likewise of this last rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
alledged by Mr H. for defence of his <hi>seeking and taking</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
<hi>at the Prelates</hi> ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds. By discussing whereof appeareth
also, that who so wil minister in the Church the holy things of
GOD, must be carefull to have such entrance and calling
thereto as he hath appoynted in his word: And that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to do, though it were vpon the commaundement and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyntment
of all the Princes of the earth, cannot but be sinne
against the Lord, who hath<note n="f" place="margin">Deut. 12. 32.</note> said, <hi>Whatsoever I commaund
you take heed you do it, thou shalt put nothing thereto nor take
ought therefrom:</hi> And contrary to that strait charge of the

               </p>
               <p>And here now would we end this writing, but that it is
needfull in a word to poynt at some other particulars mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Mr H. in this last reason.</p>
               <p>1 One is, that speaking of the ordination he took from
the Prelates, he saith here <hi>he looked not so much vnto the Man
as to the Lavv:</hi> And yet in his second reason before would
have vs beleev, he looked to the Man, that is, <hi>to the Bishop
as being a Minister and preacher of the Gospell,</hi> as there he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth.
Thus still he forgetteth himself.</p>
               <p>2. Another is, that having before in his first reason
confessed <hi>that the Prelates by the Lavv of GOD are not capable
of this povver to ordeyne Ministers vvhich is committed
vnto them by Act of Parliament,</hi> yet here he saith he came
vnto them for it, <hi>regarding vvith reverence the Lavv and
Christian Magistrate.</hi> Now how will he ever perswade this,
that he could <hi>regard vvith reverence the Lavv and Christian
Magistrate,</hi> when by his own confession it seemeth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
not with reverence the <hi>Lavv of GOD</hi> and Christ himself?
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:17773:73"/>
The<note n="h" place="margin">Pro. 8. 15. 16. Rom 13. 1—5. 1 Pet. 2. 13. vvith Act. 4. 19. 1 Sam. 22 17. Mat. 22.</note> due reverence and obedience of the Magistrate doth
and ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but depend vpon the reverence a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d obedience of God
by whom Princes raigne, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for whom they are to be obeyed,
not for wrath onely but for conscience sake. Where this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is wanting, how can the other rightly be had that depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vpon it? But of this ynough hath ben sayd already. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mark still his forgetfulnes and contradiction of himself.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, where he graunteth, <hi>the Prelates have theyr
power and authority by Act of Parliament</hi> (Yea such power and
authority as <hi>by the Lavv of God they are not capable of</hi>): it may
appeare that themselves see this Prelacy and authority there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to be no ordinance of Iesus Christ, but an humane treatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
the ordinance and constitution of Man. Let them therefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
as long as they will plead for it, and for theyr Ministery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyved
from and executed vnder it: Yet in the end will be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
of it, as of all other the inventions of men in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
that which Christ hath long synce foretold concerning
them all<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 15. 13.</note> saying, <hi>Alplanting vvhich my heavenly Father hath
not planted, shalbe rooted vp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Finally, where he sayth that <hi>vvithout the Magistrates
liking and allovvance they cannot be admitted to the Ministery
in peace;</hi> he now at length plainely bewrayeth what it is in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deed
that moveth them to receyv and joyne vnto another Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
and worship then the Lord Iesus hath ordeyned, and
so to stand in transgression against him and his holy ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:

the servants of GOD through his grace and power ben
mynded and walked in all ages: howsoever these men now
would seem to have found a nearer and more easy way to the
Kingdome of heaven. But let them not deceyv themselves:
Whatsoever they do or may think to the contrary, certayne it
is as Christ hath<note n="p" place="margin">Mat. 7. 14. Luk. 13. 24.</note> said, that <hi>the gate is strait and the vvay

               </p>
               <p>Yet do we not deny neyther, but it is to be accounted an

            <p>4. In this, Christ hath taught vs, 1. <hi>to vvhom</hi> to pray, that is, to God
onely and not to any Angell or Saint whatsoever: 2. with <hi>vvhat affection,</hi>
that is, with faith and confidence of<note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 11. 11. 13.</note> his willingnes to heare and help

and plainely teach and comprehend them all, even whatsoever is needfull to
be knowen and observed in calling vpon the Name of God, Herevpon it is

               </gap>o many severall occasions have offred vp vnto him are comprised in and
may be reduced to this forme of prayer, although they did not vse the very

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>le of prayer, and that the

rule, and not to be bound to vse this number of words, as many now
a dayes in theyr ignorance and superstition do imagine.</p>
            <p>If it be obiected, that Christ<note n="d" place="margin">Luk. 11. 2</note> said, <hi>VVhen ye pray, say, Our Father &amp;c.</hi>
and therefore that we ought in prayer to repeat these words: I aunswer first
that the Scripture showeth his meaning was not at all to bynd vs to the
vse of these syllables, but that in prayer and thanks giving we should follow
this direction and patterne which he gave. So we read in<note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 6. 9.</note> Mathew
that Christ said, <hi>After this maner</hi> pray ye, and not (as men now would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit)
<hi>Say ouer these vvords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Secondly, seing this is an absolute forme of prayer wherein is no
want or vayne repetition, if Christs meaning were to bynd vs to the vse of
<hi>these vvords,</hi> why then should we vse any other? why should we not allway
vse these, and these onely? Yea what els were it but vayne bavling and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
presumption to put other prayers in stead of this which is so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
and perfit?</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, it is to be mynded that this forme of prayer being reco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

nor the same number of words mentioned in both places. Now then, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to which of these two must we say it? If according to <hi>Luke</hi> his recording
of it, then shall we offend against that of <hi>Mathevv:</hi> and contraily: if we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:17773:74"/>
4. As God in giving the Morall law (albeit he did fully and shortly
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eclare his will in those<note n="g" place="margin">Exod. 20. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>—17. Deuter 5. 6—21.</note> ten Commaundements, yet) did not dynd the
Prophets and Priests in theyr Ministery to vse those very words, but as
occasion required according vnto them to show the people what then ought
to do or leave vndone: so Christ also giving this foune of prayer (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>beit
therein he hath fully and shortly taught vs all things needfull for prayer,
yet) hath not bound vs in calling vpon GOD to vse <hi>these vvords,</hi> but in
all things according to this rule to make our requests vnto God, with gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of thanks.</p>
            <p>5. It is without question, that the Apostles (vnto whom this rule first
was given) were carefull to keep it according to the true meaning of Christ
But they neyther tyed<note n="i" place="margin">Act. 1. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>the Lords prayer</hi> (which doubtles they would have done if they had so taken
the will of Christ to be) but they taught and exhorted them still according to
theyr necessityes and occasions in all things to show theyr requests vnto
God in all maner prayer a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d supplication in the spirit with giving of thanks,
and herevnto to watch with all perseverance: because this is <hi>the vvill of God
in Christ Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. If the Apostles had ben bound or might have tyed themselves to
<hi>these</hi> or any other set forme of words, then had they not given a sufficient
reason who (in this respect with other) it was not meet they should attend
vnto the Deacons office, because they would<note n="l" place="margin">Act. 6. 2. 4.</note> give themselves [as to the
ministration of the word so also] vnto <hi>Prayer:</hi> For it had ben easy for them ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to have said by rote or to have red o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t of a book this or any other set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of prayer.</p>
            <p>7. They which think Christ hath tyed vs to <hi>say these vvords,</hi> and that
such saying of the words is true prayer, must reconcile herewith the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
speach when he<note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 8. 6.</note> saith, <hi>VVe knovv not vvhat to pray as vve ought, but
the spirit it self maketh request for vs vvith grones that can not be expressed.</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
men (it seemeth) would aunswer, Yes we know what to pray, to witt,
<hi>the Lords prayer,</hi> which conteyneth whatsoever we need to aske: And what
then need the Spirit to teach vs what to pray as we ought?</p>
            <p>8. The Apostle (speaking of prayer in a stra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nge tongue) saith<note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 16.</note> thus,
<hi>VVhen thou blessest, hovv shall he that occupyeth the roome of the vnlearned say
Amen, at thy giving of thanks, seing he knovveth not vvhat thou speakest?</hi> Now
if they had be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tyed to the vse of the words of <hi>the Lords prayer</hi> or to any other
set sunted words, they might have aunswered, Yes we know what he saith
when he prayeth or giveth thanks, It is <hi>the Lords prayer,</hi> or some stinted
prescribed prayer which we know aforehand, and therefore vnto it though it

            <p>9 If the saying over of <hi>these</hi> or of any friend words were true prayer,
then might a man have his prayers by rote, or carry them in his pocket, or

and so to offer vp spirituall sacrifices acceptable to God through

            <p>10. Whenas Christ promiseth that our heavenly father will give the
holy Ghost to them that<note n="p" place="margin">Luk. 11. 13.</note> aske it of him: And els where speaking of the

and the like: these things being to be prayed for, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d yet these words
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:17773:75"/>
not set down in that forme of prayer, showeth that Christ hath not tyed v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to repeat over those words, but to pray after that rule according to our
wants and occasions.</p>
            <p>11 The words are so generall, as vnles they be some way opened and
particularl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> applyed, divers men will diversly vnderstand them. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
if these words <hi>(Thy kingdome come)</hi> be vsed onely in generall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any explication, the Papist vnderstandeth them of the advauncement
of Gods kingdome in and by theyr religion, the Protestant vnderstandeth
and intendeth them of the cleane contrary: And so in the rest. Neyther can
any man for himself vse them aright without some speciall application to his
particular estate and occasion: because no one mans faith and vnderstanding
can atteyne vnto all things needfull for all occasioins tymes and persons, as
those words do comprehend.</p>
            <p>12. If these words <hi>(Say yee &amp;c):</hi> must be taken and pressed according to
the letter, then would follow that in prayer we should alway speak with the
tongue: Whereas there is prayer often in the spirit alone without any words
or dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inet voyce at all: As we<note n="r" place="margin">Exod. 14. 15. Esa. 38. 14. Neh. 2. 4. 1 Sam. 1. 13. Rom. 8. 26. 27.</note> read that Moses, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ezekiah, Nehemiah,
Annah, and others have so prayed and ben accepted of God.</p>
            <p>13. Christ hath given an<note n="s" place="margin">Luk. 11. 2</note> expresse commaundement <hi>(VVhen ye pray
say, Our father &amp;c.)</hi> wherevpon I reason thus: The commaundements of
Christ are to be kept, otherwise it is sinne: therefore if Christ have here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
to vse these words in that number and order, then whosoever pray
at any tyme, and vse not these words, they sinne. But already we have seen
that the Apostles prayed and vsed not these words, and yet sinned not. And
so no doubt do other the servants of God daily according to theyr divers oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
and conditions: Not to speak here of the prayers which the preachers
vse before and after theyr sermons, neyther of theyr collects and other pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
(besides this) prescribed in theyr books. Otherwise also every man
that blesseth his table, or sayth to another, God be with you, God blesse
you, God recover you, good morrow, good night, or the like, should sinne
in this, because he prayeth and yet saith not, <hi>Our</hi> father etc.</p>
            <p>14. Yet I doubt not but we may vse any of these aswell as other words,
applying them to our speciall case and necessity: As we see that Christ pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed
<note n="t" place="margin">Ioh. 12. 28.</note> saying, <hi>Father glorify thy Name,</hi> And<note n="v" place="margin">Mat. 26 42.</note> agayn, O my <hi>Father</hi> if this
cup can not passe from me but that I must drink it, <hi>thy vvill be done,</hi> Where
we may learne by Christ who gave the rule, how to vse it, to witt, not in
a superstitious saying over these words, but in praying according to this rule
as our special necessities shall be, whether we vse any of these words or other,
or pray with sighs that cannot be expressed.</p>
            <p>15. Finally therefore all such as have framed or receyved any other forme
of Prayer but this onely which Christ hath taught, offend against this rule
and commaundement of Christ. And thus (not we, but) they who have
devised and follow other formes and books of prayer, are those which deny
and (as much as lyeth in them) disanull <hi>the Lords prayer.</hi>
