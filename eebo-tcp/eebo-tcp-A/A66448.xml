         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Most High hath adorned you with an <hi>High

            <p>Touching this most <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> and other heavenly Points

present your royal eye with a <hi>Lantskip</hi> of a <hi>Battle</hi> fought
this last Summer in your Majestyes <hi>New-England,</hi> between
some of the eminentest of the <hi>Quakers</hi> and my self, three

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:43125:3"/>
I am humbly bold to present it to your <hi>Royal Hand,</hi>

            <p>1. That your own precious <hi>Soul</hi> (infinitely more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

<hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Roots</hi> of these <hi>Protestant Disquisitions.</hi>

and concerned in these <hi>Concertations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Because it was affirmed by some of my Opposites in
publick, that there were scarce any of their <hi>Books</hi> came
forth, but the <hi>King</hi> had one: I thought it some obligation
on me, to present the <hi>Protestant Truth</hi> (thus publickly and

Opposites</hi> to offend your Royal eyes with Smoak out

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charles</hi> the Great was one of the greatest Princes of that
name in the world. And <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth (both Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours)

all) turn into the <hi>Cabbin</hi> &amp; <hi>Pit</hi> of <hi>Rottenness. Charles</hi> the

            <p>1. THe occasion of these <hi>Discourses</hi> you may see in
the first Page: the 14 <hi>Proposals</hi> in the second
Page, and the occasion of the Title in the 34.</p>
            <p>2. The truth is (as <hi>Edmund Burroughs,</hi> and
others of you say of your selves) from my Childhood (now
above three-score years) the Father of <hi>Lights</hi> and <hi>Mercies</hi>
toucht my Soul with a love to himself, to his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
the true <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> to his <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c. his
infinite Wisdome hath given me to see the City, Court
and Country, the Schools and Universities of my <hi>Native
Country,</hi> to converse with some <hi>Turks, Iews, Papists,</hi> and
all sorts of <hi>Protestants,</hi> and by Books to know the <hi>Affairs</hi>
and <hi>Religions</hi> of all <hi>Countries,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. My Conclusion is, that <hi>be of good chear thy sins are
forgiven thee,</hi> Mat. 9. is one of the joyfullest sounds that
ever came to poor sinful Ears: how to obtain this sound
from the mouth of that Mediatour that spoke it, is the
great dispute beween the <hi>Protestants</hi> and the bloody <hi>Whore
of Rome:</hi> this is also the great point between the true <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
and your selves: as also (in order to this) about
what man is (to the utmost) now by nature, what the true
Lord Jesus Christ is, and all other controversies (discussed
in this Book, not unworthy this your serious weighing (as
<hi>Mary</hi> did) in the hearts and spirits, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>4. Bear with me while I say, that as the <hi>Iesuites</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to deifie the <hi>Pope,</hi> but it is known, the end is to deifie
themselves under the cloak of the <hi>Popes</hi> Name: so Satan
<pb facs="tcp:43125:4"/>
pretends to exalt and deifie you, under the name of <hi>God,</hi>
and <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. but his end is as <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, to
exalt himself, and fill his hellish Paunch with Souls.</p>
            <p>5. I endeavoured, but could not procure a Short-hand
writer, so that I am forced to recollect Transactions from
my Memory, and I believe (as in the holy presence of
God) that I have not failed to present the true substance
of passages without advantage to my self, or disadvantage
to my Opposites.</p>
            <p>6. I have used some sharp Scripture Language, but not
(as commonly you do) passionately and unjustly: I some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
call you <hi>Foxians,</hi> (as <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> from <hi>Nicholas</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>G. Fox</hi> hath appeared the greatest Writer, and the
greatest Preacher amongst you, and the most deified that I
can hear of, sure it is that here he subtly run for it: he
ordered that my Letters to our Deputy Governour Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Cranstone</hi> (in which my Proposals to <hi>G. F.</hi> were, should
not be delivered to the Deputy, until <hi>G. F.</hi> was some hours
under sayle, that he might say he never saw my Paper,
though it is as clear as noon-day that he knew all matters
by Copies, Letters and Relations, perfectly many dayes
before his departure.</p>
            <p>7. My disadvantage (in our Contests (especially at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi>)
were great and many: for though <hi>I. Stubs.</hi> and <hi>I.
Burnet</hi> were more civil and ingenious: yet <hi>W. Edmondson</hi>
was nothing but a bundle of Ignorance, and Boisterousness,
he would speak first end all (though all three were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
on me at once) no man might speak at all in favour
of my Positions: any might freely speak against them:
they sat in the midst of the Governour &amp; Magistrates (of
their Opinion) and the whole Assembly (of their way) <hi>W.
Edmundson</hi> (though <hi>I. Stubs</hi> twice said in publick, that I had
not inter-interrupted them) yet <hi>W. Edmundson</hi> would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
and insolently interrupt me: so that I was not only
<pb facs="tcp:43125:5"/>
forced to bear patiently (through Gods only help) but to
suppress my thoughts, which here I have added in some
places. 8. I know that a great weight of your Opinions
and Actings lye upon your believing your selves guided by
the immediate Spirit of God: but I believe that I have
proved that it is no more the holy Spirit of God, that
speaks and acts in you, then it was the true <hi>Samuel</hi> that
spake such heavenly words in the appearance of <hi>Sam.</hi>
Mantle amongst a cloud of other witnesses you shall never
perswade Souls (not bewitched) that the holy spirit of God
would perswade your Women and Maidens to appear in
publick (streets &amp; assemblies) stark naked, &amp;c. of which I
have spoke more particularly in our disputations. 9. It is
hard to perswade a Fox or a Wolf that he is so, &amp;c. or
that he doth Rob or Steal, or Murther; it is hard to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
a man while he dreams that he is in a Dream: yea
though he be a filthy Dreamer as Gods Spirit speaks: In
our Dreams we believe lyes and impossibilities to be true
as that we are many thousand miles of, that we talk with
dead men, &amp;c. that we are at Marriages or Burials and are
Kings and Queens. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>10. All that I can hope for (without Gods wonderfull
mercy) is to give my Testimony in my generation: for (as
<hi>Solomon</hi> speaks of the Whore) few or none of you return.
Yet I know Gods foundation is sure he knows who are his
amongst you as amongst other perswasions. I have proved,
and will prove (if God please) that spiritual Pride, that is
Pride about spiritual matters, is the Root and Branch of
your whole Religion, and that the King Eternal, who did
cast out proud Angels out of his Palace, will hardly open
his Gates to proud and scornful Dust and Ashes:</p>

A CONFERENCE
OR
DISPUTE,
This last August 1672 (so called) in the
Colony of Rode-Iland and Providence, Plantations in
N. ENGLAND, between Roger Williams of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
(who Challenged Fox by writing (which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes)
and all his Friends then met on Rode-Iland,
(and G. Fox withdrawing) Iohn

Edmundon (three of their ablest Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles)
on the other, that is, (on the
pretended Quakers) Party.</head>
            <p>HAving long heard of the great name of
<hi>G. Fox,</hi> (a man cried up by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
called <hi>Quakers</hi>) and having read
his book in Folio (some years since)
against,<note place="margin">The Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </note>
as I think above <hi>six score Books</hi> and <hi>Papers</hi>
(written by pious and able pens against them) and
now this Summer hearing of his coming into these
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43125:7"/>
Parts of <hi>N England,</hi> and the poor cheated Souls the
<hi>Quakers</hi> with joy expecting his coming,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>G Fox</hi> his Book in <hi>Folio</hi> weighed.</note> as the
coming of <hi>an Angel of light</hi> from Heaven: I read
over his Book afresh (as in the holy presence and
eye of God, (with a single Eye and Heart) and more
clearly finding his <hi>Answers</hi> so weak and silly, so
Anti-Christian and Blasphemous, and yet so Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Scornfull, so Cursing and Censorious, [2]
Damning and Reprobating all that bow not down to
their new <hi>Upstart Image,</hi> my Spirit rose up within
me, and I believe the holy <hi>Spirit of God</hi> (in answer
to my poor Petitions and Meditations) resolved and
quickened my Spirit to the present <hi>Undertake</hi> and
Service. And therefore for his most holy Names
sake, and the name of his most holy only begotten,
the true <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> the <hi>God-Man</hi> and <hi>Mediator</hi>
&amp;c, And for the honour of the most holy <hi>Spirit
of God</hi> (so horribly torn in pieces by this foul <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Quakers</hi>) For the vindicating of many of
the precious Truths of the old <hi>Christian purity,</hi> and
for the sake of so many precious Souls lying slain
and bleeding before me, I made this Offer follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and any or all his Followers or As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociates,
then together at <hi>New-port</hi> on <hi>Rode-Iland.</hi>
Tis true <hi>G. Fox,</hi> was at <hi>Providence</hi> some few dayes
before, and spake publickly; and it was free for
me publickly to have heard him, and opposed him;
But going the last year to one of their general Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyes
at <hi>New-Port,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Spirit of Confusion in the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kers</hi> Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note>
and having begun to present to
them some Considerations about the <hi>True Christ</hi> and
the <hi>false,</hi> the <hi>True Spirit</hi> and the <hi>False</hi> and being cut
of in the midest, by sudden <hi>Prayer</hi> of one, and the

               <hi>Singing</hi> of another, and then by the <hi>Prayer</hi> of
another and the sudden dissolving of the Assembly,
I resolved to try another way, and to offer a fair
and full <hi>Dispute,</hi> according to <hi>Ed. Burrowes</hi> (and
therein <hi>G Foxes</hi>) Offer in his large <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Foxes</hi>
Book. To this Purpose I drew up my thoughts
into fourteen <hi>Propositions;</hi> and knowing that <hi>New-Port</hi>
was the chief Town on <hi>Rode-Iland</hi> and <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
on the <hi>Main,</hi> and that <hi>G. Fox</hi> had spake at

and <hi>Humanity,</hi> as such an <hi>Exercise,</hi> by such

                        <p>
                           <hi>First</hi> That the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> are not true
Quakers according to the holy <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2 That the <hi>Christ</hi> they profess is not the <hi>True
Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3 That the <hi>Spirit</hi> by which they are acted is not

                        </p>
                        <p>4 That they doe not own the holy <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5 Their <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Professions,</hi> are full of
<hi>Contradictions</hi> and <hi>Hypocrisies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>6 That their <hi>Religion</hi> is not only an <hi>Heresy</hi> in the

Faith.</hi> &amp;c</p>
                        <p>7 Their <hi>Religion</hi> is but a confused mixture of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
Armineanisme, Socineanisme, Judaisme</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>8 <hi>The People called</hi> Quakers <hi>(in effect) hold no</hi> God,
no Christ, no Spirit, no Angel, no Devil, no Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urrection,
no Judgment, no Heaven, no Hell, <hi>but
what is in man.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>9 All that their <hi>Religion</hi> requires (externall and
internall) to make <hi>Converts</hi> and Proselites, amounts to
no more than what a <hi>Reprobate</hi> may easily attain unto,
and perform.</p>
                        <p>10 That the Popes of Rome doe not swell with, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43125:8"/>
exercise a greater <hi>Pride,</hi> then the <hi>Quakers</hi> Spirit hath
exprest, and doth aspire unto, although many truly humble
Soules may be captivated amongst them, as may be in
other <hi>Religions.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>11 The Quakers <hi>Religion</hi> is more obstructive, and
destructive to the <hi>Conversion</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> of the
Souls of People, then most of the Religions this day ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
in the world.</p>
                        <p>12 The <hi>Sufferings</hi> of the <hi>Quakers</hi> are no true evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Truth of their <hi>Religion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>13 That their many <hi>Books and writings</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
Poor, Lame, Naked, and sweld up only with
<hi>high Titles</hi> and words of Boasting and <hi>Vapour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>[4] 14. That the Spirit of their <hi>Religion</hi> tends
mainly,</p>
                        <p>1 To reduce Persons from <hi>Civility</hi> to <hi>Barbarisme.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3 To an <hi>Arbetratry Goverment,</hi> and the Dictates
and Decrees of that <hi>sudden Spirit</hi> that acts them,</p>
                        <p>3 To a sudden cutting off of <hi>People,</hi> yea of <hi>Kings</hi>
and <hi>Princes</hi> opposing them.</p>
                        <p>4 To as fiery <hi>Persecutions</hi> for matters of Religion
and Conscience, as hath been or can be practised by any
<hi>Hunters</hi> or <hi>Persecutors</hi> in the world.</p>
                        <p>Under these forementioned <hi>Heads</hi> (if the Spirit of
the <hi>Quakers</hi> dare civilly to Argue) will be opened many
of the <hi>Popish, Protestant, Jewish</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
which cannot here be mentioned, in the Dispute
(if God please) they must be alleadged, and the <hi>Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
left to every persons <hi>Conscience,</hi> as they will
answer to God, (at their own Perills) in the great day

            <p>THis Paper above-said I sent inclosed in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to my kind friend <hi>Capt. Cranston</hi> Deputy
Governour of the <hi>Colony,</hi> that being such a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
person, he might timely be informed of such

afterwards he carefully did) to afford his <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and Assistance</hi> to such <hi>Peaceable</hi> and <hi>Pious
Exercises.</hi> But before the <hi>Boat</hi> went down with
the Letter aforesaid from <hi>Providence</hi> to <hi>Newport,</hi>
I sent a Copy of my Positions to a Neighbour <hi>I T.</hi>
whom I heard was inclining to them.<note place="margin">The sirst usage to the <hi>Author</hi> &amp; his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals.</hi>
               </note>
He takes a

<hi>Iohn Crosman</hi> Master of the Boat (one of
them also) who presently the same hour, called me
<hi>Blind Sot</hi> in the open <hi>Street,</hi> upbraiding me, how I
durst send my 14 <hi>Lyes</hi> to such a man as <hi>G. Fox</hi>
(one of them called him) <hi>the eternall Son of God;</hi>
so that before my Letter went to <hi>Newport</hi> (which
<hi>Crosman</hi> carried) by Letters, &amp; <hi>Crosman</hi> his and
other Relations,<note place="margin">The deceit fulness of <hi>Fox</hi> &amp; <hi>Foxians.</hi>
               </note> all was known, even long before
my Letters were opened, or delivered to the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Governour: For in the <hi>Iunto</hi> of the <hi>Foxians</hi> at
<hi>Newport</hi> it was concluded for <hi>Infallible Reasons,</hi> that
His <hi>Holiness G. Fox</hi> should withdraw, seeing there
was such a Knot of the Apostles of Christ Jesus
now at <hi>Newport</hi> together, (especially <hi>Iohn Stubs,</hi> a
man knowing the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi>) Therefore that
it might appear that such a Nehemiah as he would
not fly, it was [5] agreed that my Letters should
not be delivered to the <hi>Deputy Governour,</hi> untill <hi>G.
Fox</hi> was gone; so that it might be truly said, that
he never saw the Paper which I sent unto him. I
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43125:9"/>
had a touch of this <hi>Leger de main</hi> trick in our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
at <hi>Newport,</hi>
               <note place="margin">one of the subtil <hi>Tricks</hi> of this subtil <hi>Fox</hi> viz. to steal hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly from the <hi>Dispute</hi> &amp; yet not to seem at all to run for it.</note> and the <hi>Deputy Governour</hi> did pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
testifie that my Letters to him were dated
the 13 of <hi>Iuly</hi> (which he said he wondered at) but
were not brought to him untill the 26th of the said
Moneth, and untill <hi>G. Fox</hi> was some hours departed.
<hi>Iohn Burniat</hi> profest that that he knew noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the detaining of the Letters, only he knew
that <hi>G. Fox</hi> never saw my Paper. <hi>G. F.</hi> supposed
I would be forced to be as plain in my <hi>Proofs</hi> as I
was in my <hi>Positions.</hi> He knew that I was furnished
with <hi>Artillery</hi> out of his own <hi>Writings.</hi> He saw
what <hi>Consequences</hi> would roll down the mountaines
upon him from his proud and Insolent, yet poor
and bald <hi>Writings;</hi> and how far some of his pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
practices were fallen out with his <hi>Writings,</hi> and
therefore this old <hi>Fox</hi> thought it best to run for it,
and leave the work to his <hi>Iourney-men</hi> and <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains</hi>
to perform in his absence for him.</p>
            <p>Before I come to Transactions between those
three left behind him <hi>[Iohn Stubs, Iohn Burnet,

Having read this Letter, and knowing this my
Neighbour of late to have declined much from his
former profession of <hi>Godli, ness,</hi> and many wayes by
his <hi>Loosness</hi> had grieved my <hi>Soul,</hi> I wondered not
much at his Lines, (though now much unexpected
of him) as knowing the Quakers spirit, to be a
ready Ditch or <hi>Gulfe,</hi> that readily sucks and draws
into it Soules <hi>afrighted</hi> easily to skin over their
Sores; Proud and Self-conceited ones, who gladly
close with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of,<note place="margin">Fuel <hi>for the</hi> Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Fire <hi>of</hi> Hell.</note> and Children of <hi>Pride,</hi> and

ready. As for charging me with <hi>Irrationality</hi> for not
alleadging Scripture for what I write, yet I alleadged
three Scriptures, one of which thou wrestest, adding
what I wrote not, so that if I had urged more, I should
have had the like Catching: But we both must come to

thy Blood-thirsty spirit, which thy friends at

Invalid. How childish didst thou act to swear against
One, when another told thee of somewhat spoken to allay
thy fury against <hi>William Harris?</hi> Call to mind thy
Books written, and see thy Fickleness, wanting a Guid

<hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Reason</hi> to prove them so;<note place="margin">Unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                     </note>
and here you
say <hi>[For my charging upon thee Lyes and Slanders,
examine but thy Positions, which will make manifest
what I say]</hi> But is this any more <hi>Rationall</hi> or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like?
or is it not bruitish to say, you are a <hi>Lyar</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you are a <hi>Lyar;</hi> [12] Or you are a <hi>Lyar</hi>
because you say these <hi>Positions</hi> are true, and offer to
prove them. It is a <hi>Man-like spirit</hi> to lead a <hi>Beast</hi>
with an <hi>Halter,</hi> but a <hi>Man</hi> with <hi>Reason;</hi> but to lead
or drive a Man with an <hi>Halter</hi> or Cudgel, and not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43125:15"/>
with a <hi>Reason,</hi> (in <hi>Naturalls</hi> and <hi>Rationalls,</hi> most of
all in <hi>Spirittalls</hi>) is not the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> nor of
<hi>Humanity:</hi> For what will my <hi>Chargings,</hi> and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and Clamors, and Cursings, and Damnings
effect and beget upon a rationall Soul, without a
proof of Reason, but an Opinion of my wicked
false bruitish and irrationall <hi>spirit?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Tis true in your Exhortation to me, you bid
me hearken to the <hi>Manifestation of the Spirit</hi> which
is given to every man <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This I acknowledg
<hi>Scripture.</hi> You say I wrested and added to an other
Scripture, but you mention it not, so I am in the
dark what you mean. And for this of the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
of the Spirit,</hi> your self now consent to me,
that it was spoken to the Saints or Christians at
<hi>Corinth,</hi> and therefore I spake true in saying, that
as to my Positions (by you call'd <hi>Impudent Lyes and
Slanders</hi>) you gave me not then, nor now any one
<hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Reason</hi> to prove any one of my <hi>Positions</hi>
to be so.</p>
                  <p>4. As to <hi>Iohn Burnet,</hi> I said before him and
afterwards, that he delivered many <hi>Truths:</hi> yet
withall,<note place="margin">I can give many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of their abus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ordinance and Name of the <hi>Spirit of Prayer</hi> for a sudden <hi>Silencing</hi> of their Opposites.</note> I then at the same time (in their <hi>Publick
Assembly</hi> at <hi>Newport</hi>) I told them, that it lay upon
them to manifest to their own <hi>Souls</hi> and others, 1.
That their <hi>Christ</hi> was <hi>true</hi> 2. That their <hi>Spirit</hi>
was <hi>Gods,</hi> and the rather because they were charged
with denying the <hi>Institutions</hi> of <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and
with the setting up of many <hi>Will-worships,</hi> as
<hi>Preaching of Women &amp;c.</hi> And I went on purpose
to <hi>Discourse</hi> of these matters (this being the time
of their <hi>Generall Assembly,</hi> and a great <hi>Concourse</hi>) I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43125:15"/>
was stopt by the sudden praying of the <hi>Governour's
Wife,</hi> who also told me of her asking her husband
at home (meaning <hi>Christ</hi> which I had toucht upon)
I rose up and said, if a man had so alleadged, I
would have answered him: But I would not
Countenance so much the violation of <hi>Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
in making a Reply to a <hi>Woman</hi> in Publick:
Hereupon <hi>I. Nicols</hi> stood up and said <hi>[In Christ
Iesus neither male or female &amp;c.]</hi> I was Replying to
him and to <hi>I. Burnets</hi> Speech also concerning their
<hi>Spirit,</hi> but I was stopt by <hi>Iohn Burnets</hi> sudden fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Prayer, and dismissing the <hi>Assembly.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
(with Gods help) to be <hi>Patient</hi> and <hi>Civill,</hi>
and so I ceased, not seing a willingness in them for
me to proceed; which experience made me not to
trouble [13] <hi>G. Fox</hi> and the <hi>Assembly</hi> at <hi>Providence,</hi>
but rather to make a fair and Solemn offer of <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute</hi>
about these matters: so that it is notorioufly
false, that I <hi>Owned</hi> or <hi>Countenanced</hi> any of their
<hi>Opinions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5 You tell me of my foisting in that word
<hi>Damning,</hi> and I tell you that those words of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi>
and <hi>Damnation</hi> are all one in your <hi>Greek</hi>
and <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>English</hi> and other Languages: So
that in your telling me if I hearken not to you, it
will be my <hi>Condemnation,</hi> you (all one) tell mee it
will be my <hi>Damnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are two <hi>Damnations,</hi> one which all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
is under, <hi>(He that believeth not is condemned
already</hi>) the other, that finall Sentence <hi>[Goe ye
Cursed]</hi> my <hi>Charity</hi> bids judge that you meant not
the latter: But my <hi>Knowledg</hi> tells me amongst
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43125:16"/>
                     <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Turks, Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi>
(with all of which I have conversed) I never met
with such a Judging Censuring Reviling <hi>spirit</hi> as is
the <hi>spirit</hi> of the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. As to my saying in my 14th Position, that
the spirit of the <hi>Quakers</hi> tends to a sudden <hi>Cutting
off</hi> of people, yea <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes:</hi> It lyes upon
me to prove it, and you do only upbraid me with
it but offer no disproof, nor can you or any other
evade it, when the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Affairs</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> are
dig'd up and examined.</p>
                  <p>7. Next you cry out against my Blood-thirsty
spirit in <hi>William Harris</hi> his Case: and I answer
that it is not the sign nor the part of Loyall and
gratefull subjects having received such wonderfull
<hi>Favours</hi> and Priviledges from so mighty a <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch,</hi>
so to Slight and damn, to Null and make void

Would'st thou have me to take the matter in hand

the Circumstances considered, it cannot possibly be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aleld

                  <note place="margin">My Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to <hi>I T.</hi> his 3d <hi>Assault</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me.</note>
                  <p>MY ancient Friend, it pleaseth the most High
to give to all mankind (his <hi>Children</hi> also and
them especially) many <hi>bitter Cups,</hi> and that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by the hands of <hi>dear friends</hi> and [18] <hi>dear
Relations,</hi> that we might fall more in love with
himself then ever who isinfinitely more sweet, and
even Holiness and Power and Wisdom and Love
it self.</p>
                  <p>Your Lines (in this your third <hi>Fury</hi> against me)
being full of <hi>Bitterness</hi> in themselves, are more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to my Spirit upon diverse accounts. But the
<hi>most High</hi> and <hi>only Wise</hi> will have it so, and your
judgment and Conscience (and mine) will have it
so, yet that will not acquit us, we both say we must
come to another <hi>Barr,</hi> and there stand or fall eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
                  <p>In this, <hi>First.</hi> You tell me you willingly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Particulars I mentioned as not concerning
the matters in handling:<note place="margin">A deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full way of Answ.</note> I am not of your mind,
it is an <hi>Easie</hi> yet a <hi>Suspicious</hi> way of answering, and
implyes not only unwillingness, but a <hi>willing Ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
and <hi>Guilt</hi> also: For is it not concerning the
matter in hand (especially when so personally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked)
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43125:20"/>
to vindicate our selves and friends, our
Teachers and <hi>Apostles,</hi> our <hi>Spirits</hi> and Religion
also?</p>
                  <p>2. Next you blame my subtle spirit, for not
answering by Scripture or Reason your loving Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions:
I gave you my Reason, shewing how
simple it was for you to give fire upon me, and tell
me my <hi>Paper</hi> was <hi>Scurrilous, full fraught with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
Lyes and Slanders,</hi> and yet give me not one
<hi>Scripture</hi> nor <hi>Reason</hi> to prove any of them to be
so. 2. I shewed you how irrationall it was for
you to think, that I should so suddenly renounce
my understanding and <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Positions</hi> upon
the sudden sound of your Outcry <hi>Repent, Repent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. You tell me it is childish,<note place="margin">The hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Q Women</hi> shews the worse then <hi>barbarous nakedness</hi> of their Spirits.</note> bruitish and irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall,
to say that you are worse then <hi>Barbarians:
Answ.</hi> I said not so in generall, you and all the
world ought to abhor the particular case, <hi>viz.</hi> the
stripping <hi>Naked</hi> of your <hi>Women</hi> and Maidens; a
case worse then Savage and Barbarous, only prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
by the <hi>Bruites,</hi> and sometimes by <hi>Indians,</hi> and
<hi>Whores</hi> in their drink, when all <hi>Modesty</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
is overwhelmed with more then common
<hi>Drunkenness.</hi> Who can but abhor to think of
such whorish and monstrous <hi>Immodesty,</hi> such an
hellish <hi>Incentive</hi> to filthy Lusts, and that under the
most holy name of the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. <hi>As</hi> to my first Position, you now tell me that
it is childish and foolish for <hi>G. Fox</hi> to prove (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
you mean,<note place="margin">the name</note> for me to desire <hi>G. Fox</hi> to prove)
what he and all friends disown,<note place="margin">Quakers.</note> and thou in scorn
callest Quakers: <hi>Answ.</hi> I know the Quakers
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:43125:20"/>
say [19] that name is given them in scorn, and
yet we also know it it hath its denomination from
those great bodily <hi>Shakings</hi> which have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to have come in mightily upon them by the
power of <hi>Devillish spirits</hi> (for many Reasons of
which afterward) However <hi>G. Fox</hi> in 370th. page
of his Book <hi>in Folio</hi> writes thus in the title of each
page <hi>[The Quakers answer. The Quakers Answer]</hi> I
know what may be said; and I know may be said
and justly to that excuse, and what shall be said in
the Dispute following.</p>
                  <p>5. As to my 12th. <hi>Position,</hi> of Suffering of the
<hi>Quakers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> and you say it is a <hi>Brat</hi> of mine own, and
that is an evidence against me, and all os my <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting
Spirit. Answ.</hi> I shall (by Gods assistance
prove that you doe make it an <hi>Evidence</hi> of your
<hi>Religion,</hi> and then it must be your one <hi>Brat</hi> and
<hi>Bastard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to my persecuting spirit, the most High hath
been a holy witness to my Travels and losses and haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
and other sufferings, in my vindicating and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
<hi>Soul-liberty:</hi> and I humbly hope in his mercy,
he will preserve me from being like many <hi>Quakers,</hi>
fouly fallen from their former <hi>Christan Religion</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. You say, <hi>How darest thou blame me for not
giving Scripture or Reason against thy railing and
impious Positions, when thou challengest and assignest
another to doe it</hi> G. Fox, <hi>&amp;.c. Answ.</hi> I only blamed
<hi>I. T.</hi> for being so fierce and furious, so hot and
hasty in crying out <hi>a scurrilous Paper fraught with
lyes and impudent slanders,</hi> and yet gave me not one
Scripture or Reason against any one of them: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43125:21"/>
                     <hi>Modesty</hi> and humane <hi>Sobriety</hi> would have
taught a little Patience, till <hi>G. Fox</hi> had answered,
or untill you had answered something of <hi>Scripture</hi>
or <hi>Reason</hi> your self.</p>
                  <p>7. Nextly you tell me of my <hi>Serpent-like spirit</hi>
in witnessing against my neighbour secretly: To
which I lay before the most High, I know not
what you intend 2. I know it not to be any
Crime (much less a serpent-like spirit as your rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pen phrases it) to give a true testimony, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in private and publick, even against the <hi>highest</hi>
and dearest, in the matters of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi>
which ought to be only <hi>High</hi> and only <hi>Dear</hi>
unto us.</p>
                  <p>8. As to <hi>Womens preaching</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Womens Preaching.</note> in the Church, you
tell me that I know not what that <hi>Woman</hi> is, <hi>Answ.</hi>
I know the allegoricall Interpretations given of
both those Scriptures, to the <hi>Corinths</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi>
But where the holy <hi>Scripture</hi> is plain, and agrees
20] even with <hi>Nature</hi> it self; where the holy <hi>Spirit</hi>
of <hi>God</hi> gives Reasons why Scripture should be fo
expounded (which is an extraordinary signification
of Gods soveraign will and pleasure) where else one
part must be <hi>Literall</hi> and an other part <hi>Allegoricall,</hi>
(which is most improper and not suiting to the
<hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> of <hi>Gods Spirit</hi>) what can be
soberly in the fear of God and with any sober rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
collected, but that the most High, the <hi>God</hi> of
<hi>Order</hi> (and all Order and Wisdom it self) is pleased
there to set down the <hi>Order</hi> of his <hi>Worship</hi> in the
Christian <hi>Congregations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. Concerning <hi>W Harris</hi> you tell me I shift
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43125:21"/>
of the matter, for you meant not <hi>W Harris</hi> his last
Imprisonment: You prove it by my taking Oath
against your Wife upon an other mans word on
purpose to allay my furious spirit against <hi>W Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi>
These are your words, which may be taken
three wayes, but neither of them can I call to
mind: God knowes I truly desire to See, Lament
and forsake every Idle word or thought, which my
soul may be satisfied is so: for I dare not goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
(as you proudly doe) that <hi>Direction</hi> of the
<hi>Lord Iesus, dayly</hi> to cry <hi>[Forgive us our Trespasses]</hi>
I dare most confidently deny that simple Charge,
<hi>viz.</hi> that I should cry out <hi>Treason</hi> Treason, against
your Wife and others, labouring to bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the same guilt with <hi>W. Harris.</hi> whose facts and
courses others (of no small <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi>
amongst us, with whome I advised) saw to be des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
high <hi>Treason</hi> against the <hi>Laws</hi> of our
<hi>Mother England,</hi> and of this <hi>Colony</hi> also. When
<hi>W Harris,</hi> sent his <hi>writings</hi> or <hi>Books</hi> to the <hi>Main</hi>
and to the <hi>Iland,</hi> against all <hi>Earthly Powers, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
Laws, Charters, Magistrates, Prisons, Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishments,
Rates,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>W Harris</hi> his former practices against all <hi>Goverment</hi> but that of <hi>Saints</hi> as the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> now speak.</note> yea and against all <hi>Kings, and
Princes,</hi> under that Notion that the People should
shortly cry out, <hi>no lords no masters;</hi> and had in open
Court protested, (before the whole <hi>Colony</hi> assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled)
that he would maintain his Writings with
his <hi>Blood.</hi> Was it my Fury (as you call it) or was
it not <hi>Honesty</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Colony</hi> and
the <hi>higher Powers</hi> then in <hi>England</hi> to act faithfully
and impartially in the place wherein I then stood
<hi>Centinell?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:43125:22"/>
And it is not true that I sought his life as you
upbraid me, much less theirs, who purposely (as
the most high God is witness) were presented, that
some prudent course might be taken by the Court
for the preventing of their greater danger, and the
<hi>Colonyes</hi> also. By your reason the <hi>Kings Majesty,</hi>
his <hi>Iudges</hi> (yea all <hi>Iudges</hi>) [21] yea the <hi>King</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
yea the <hi>most High,</hi> and <hi>King of Kings</hi> shall be
condemned as <hi>Blood-thirsty,</hi> bloody seekers of the
lives (though of high handed wilfull and dangerous
<hi>Transgressors</hi>) as though <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> true
<hi>Pitty</hi> and just <hi>Severity</hi> might not harmonize, and
make up the blessed concord of Peace together.</p>
                  <p>10. You mind me again of my Books against
Persecution, and yet my self a <hi>Persecutor</hi> of my
peacable Neighbours to the <hi>Death,</hi> murthering the
innocent, yea that I still retain a <hi>Murtherous</hi> mind,
and you cry out against me, <hi>Oh murtherous Man</hi>
&amp;.c. To which I say, I am not better than <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
nor (in this case) are you better than <hi>Shimei,</hi>
who rak't up <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Dirt,</hi> and flung them with
<hi>Railings</hi> at <hi>David,</hi> crying out <hi>Come out thou bloody
Man,</hi> and this in the name of the holy <hi>Spirit</hi> also.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>W. H.</hi> I never appeared In <hi>Town</hi> or <hi>Colony</hi>
against him for any private matter (although many
wayes extraordinarily provoked and wronged by
him) but alwayes in Witness (as I humbly appeal
unto God) I say in witnessing against his <hi>running

                     <note place="margin">My Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness as to my deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>W. H.</hi>

                     <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Countrey:</hi> I heartily wish that your
hands were washed from the bloody trade of
<hi>Liquours</hi> to the <hi>Indians,</hi> which even the <hi>Quakers</hi>
have practised, telling the <hi>Indians</hi> that the <hi>Quakers</hi>
only know God, and therefore would sell them
<hi>Powder</hi> and <hi>Liquors</hi> cheaper, and they would not
mix water with <hi>Rhum</hi> as others did: so that by
many sudden deaths, what by <hi>Consumptions</hi> and

if not <hi>thousands</hi> in the whole Countrey, and
more in this <hi>Colony</hi> than in any part of the <hi>Countrey</hi>
beside that I have heard of, against which I have
witnessed from Court to Court in vain.</p>
                  <p>11 You ask me how I can think as <hi>low</hi> of my
self, as you <hi>high</hi> of <hi>G. Fox,</hi> when I boast of <hi>Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
Experience &amp;.c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer, I boast as <hi>Paul</hi> did, who confest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the least of all <hi>Saints,</hi> and the chiefe of <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi>
and yet reckons up the <hi>Priviledges</hi> end <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,</hi>
which God had vouchsafed to him, against
the foule Clamours of his malicious and envious
Opposites, the false <hi>Apostles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. You conclude with advising my <hi>Repentance,</hi>
and you propose to me the case of <hi>Nineve,</hi> telling
me that forty dayes is a short <hi>Speech.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>22] <hi>Answ.</hi> I humbly beseech the <hi>Lord</hi> to help
you and me, humbly and faithfully to examine our
true laying of that <hi>Foundation</hi> of a true Repentance,
which is a totall turning of our <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> unto
God; not out of <hi>Fear</hi> or self ends, as <hi>Dissemblers</hi>
do; but in <hi>Mariage-love</hi> with <hi>God</hi> that it might be
said unto us, <hi>thy Maker is thy Husband.</hi>
                  </p>

As to your special Hint to me of forty dayes, I
can say it (through infinite mercy) that more than
forty or fifty yeares, I have been acquainted with
<hi>Death,</hi> and have (not seldom) familiarly discoursed
with the <hi>Grave</hi> and <hi>Pit of Rottenness:</hi> I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to be ready at a <hi>minutes warning,</hi> waiting for
a wind to transport me (as <hi>Paul</hi> speaks) unto <hi>Christ
Iesus</hi> in <hi>Abrahams Bosome</hi> which is best of all. I
pray you to know that I believe there is a <hi>black

HItherto (gentle <hi>Reader</hi>) have been the <hi>Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishings</hi>
of my <hi>Forlorn-Hope;</hi> I hasten now to
the relation of the main <hi>Battle,</hi> for after this my
third Letter and <hi>Answer,</hi> I heard no more of that
<hi>foul</hi> and <hi>slanderous spirit:</hi> I should rejoice to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall
to his casting out of my ancient friend
<hi>I T.</hi> however he pluckt in his horns as <hi>G Fox</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
did, and I have yet heard no further.</p>
            <p>Within some few dayes after that our <hi>Deputy
Governour</hi> had [23] delivered my Paper to them,
the strange <hi>Quakers</hi> (as was agreed with <hi>G. Fox</hi>)
came to <hi>Providence.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The first <hi>Interveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> at Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the <hi>Qu.</hi> and my self.</note> 
               <hi>Iohn Stubs, Iohn Burnet,</hi> and
others, and came to my house six or seven together:
their <hi>Salutations</hi> were (like the meetings of their
<hi>dumb spirit</hi>) in silence. I bid them welcome <hi>&amp;.c.
Iohn Stubs</hi> began and said, they had received a
Paper from me, and they came to me to tell me,
that they accepted my <hi>Offer,</hi> and that they had
appointed (according to the liberty given them by
my self in my Paper) the 9th. of the present <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi>
to be the day at <hi>Newport.</hi> I told them they
were welcome, and the more welcome because they
brought me tidings of their <hi>Resolution:</hi> for I longed
for <hi>Opportunityes</hi> of such <hi>Exercises,</hi> to which I
thought the most High invited us by our precious
<hi>Libertyes &amp;.c.</hi> I added that my Paper was in the
first place directed to <hi>G. Fox:</hi> but they suddenly
catcht at my word,<note place="margin">G Fox <hi>his cunning</hi> Departure.</note> and <hi>Iohn Burnet</hi> told me that
<hi>G. Fox</hi> was departed before my <hi>Letters</hi> were opened,
and that <hi>G. Fox</hi> never saw my Paper (and probably
as afterward in the dispute he spake honestlie not
knowing the Mistery) <hi>Iohn Stubs</hi> added that my
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43125:24"/>
Paper gave liberty to <hi>G. Fox</hi> or his friends. I sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
therefore I would not fail (if God pleased) to meet
them at the place, and by nine in the morning, on
the day they had appointed.</p>
            <p>They departed (after drink offered and accepted
by some) but the next morning being the first of
the Week I sent them word in writing, that diverse
of our Neighbours were grieved that the <hi>Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
should be carried away from <hi>Providence</hi> to
<hi>Newport</hi> wholly,<note place="margin">My care of ingaging them to my whole <hi>Offer</hi> and of discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the latter seven at <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
               </note>
(as some of them had also spoken)
I told them that the accepting of my <hi>Proffer</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
included the Conference about the latter
seven at <hi>Providence:</hi> I told them their <hi>Consciences</hi>
and <hi>Credits</hi> lay on it, and therefore desired them to
six on a day for the dispute of the latter seven at
<hi>Providence</hi> before their departure hence. This Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
was delivered to one of their Company in the
room where they were together, but whither on
purpose or (as tis possible) by mistake, they say the
Paper was lost: so receiving no Answer from them,
I late in the evening sent them another writing,
signifiing, that I could not hold my self ingaged to
meet them at <hi>Newport</hi> about the first seven, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their promise of discussing the latter seven at
<hi>Providence.</hi> Then they wrote to me that I had
seemed willing, and that they had given notice, and
the Countrey would come in, therefore they
challenged me to appear and prove my malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
[24] and bitter charges against them, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
promised that upon the finishing of the first

meeting a <hi>Providence &amp;.c.</hi> Upon the receipt of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43125:24"/>
this, I sent them a third writing signifiing that I
rested in their Promise, and therefore (if God
pleased) I would not fail to be with them at the time
and place appointed. And God graciously assisted
me in rowing all day with my old bones so that I
got to <hi>Newport</hi> toward the <hi>Midnight</hi> before the
morning appointed.</p>
            <p>Then I sent them a fourth Paper (with a Copie
of my first that miscaried as they said) and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to them, that it would be convenient to agree
about some <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Transition,</hi> or passing from one
position to another: as also since they were <hi>many</hi>
and I but <hi>One,</hi> I presumed their Reason told them
that I expected but <hi>One at once,</hi> and that if
another desired to speak, the first should hold his
peace; as also I signified that some were scrupulous
of going into the <hi>Quakers Meeting-house,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Scruples about meeting in the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing house</hi> at <hi>Newport</hi>
               </note> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I desired some thoughts about it: they thought
it convenient to send <hi>H. Bull</hi> to request me to goe
to his house to them; I went; they urged the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paciousness</hi>
and <hi>Conveniency</hi> of their house, and I
told such as scrupled, that it was one thing to
goe into a <hi>Iewish Synagogue,</hi> or a <hi>Popish Chappell</hi> to
worship, or countenance their <hi>Worships:</hi> another
thing to <hi>Profess</hi> and <hi>Contest</hi> against them, in which
respect <hi>Paul</hi> disputed many dayes in the <hi>Iewes
Synagogues</hi> against them, and I could freelie goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Popes Chappel,</hi> to dispute against the <hi>Pope</hi>
and his <hi>Worship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I knew our aged <hi>Governour Mr. Nich. Easton</hi>
&amp; other <hi>Magistrates</hi> (of their judgment) would be
there,<note place="margin">the way to Conquer.</note> &amp; so the <hi>Civill Peace</hi> maintained, &amp; I had a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43125:25"/>
strange <hi>assurance</hi> given in to my <hi>spirit</hi> from God in
answer to my poor requests <hi>&amp;.c. viz,</hi> that by <hi>Mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration</hi>
and <hi>Patience</hi> I should conquer their <hi>Immod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations</hi>
and <hi>impatiencies,</hi> I therefore thought it in
vain to spend time about a <hi>Moderatour:</hi> Tis true
they gave me no Answer either by Speech, or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
concerning their coming on me one at once,
but to their seeming great advantage they constantly
fell on me <hi>all at once,</hi> and one of them <hi>William Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundson</hi>
with grievous Language and insulting.</p>
            <p>When I came into the place aforesaid I found
three able and noted preachers amongst them,<note place="margin">The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting with me.</note> 
               <hi>viz
Iohn Stubs, Iohn Burnet, William Edmunson</hi> sitting
together on an high Bench with some of the
<hi>Magistrates</hi> of their Judgment with them: I had
heard [25] that <hi>Iohn Stubs</hi> was learned in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
and the <hi>Greek</hi> (and I found him so) as for
<hi>Iohn Burnet</hi> I found him to be of a moderate <hi>Spirit,</hi>
and a very able Speaker.<note place="margin">W Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundson <hi>described.</hi>
               </note> The third <hi>W. Edmund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
was newly come (as was said) from <hi>Virginia,</hi> and
he proved the <hi>Chief Speaker,</hi> a man not so able nor
so <hi>moderate</hi> as the other two: For the two first
would speak <hi>Argument,</hi> and discuss and produce
<hi>Scripture:</hi> but <hi>William Edmundson</hi> was very ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
in the <hi>Scripture</hi> or any other Learning: He
had been a souldier in the late warres, a stout port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man of a great voice, and fit to make a <hi>Braga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia</hi>
(as he did) and a constant exercise meerly of
my Patience: he would often <hi>Vapour</hi> and preach
long, and when I had patiently waited till the <hi>Gust</hi>
was over, and began to speak, then would he stop
my mouth with a very unhandsome Clout of a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43125:25"/>
grievous <hi>Interruption:</hi> so that sometimes I was forc't
to play the <hi>Moderator,</hi> and to protest that such
practises were against the sober rules of <hi>Civillity</hi>
and <hi>Humanity.</hi> It pleased God to help me with
such <hi>Patience</hi> to weather them, that <hi>Iohn Stubs</hi>
openly confest twice,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>I Stubs</hi> his Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity.</note>
that though some others had
given them some interruptions, yet that I had not
done it.</p>
            <p>I took my Seat at the other end of the house
opposite to them,<note place="margin">The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Dispute</hi>
               </note> and began telling them that the
<hi>most High</hi> was my witness, that not out of any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
against, or disrespect to the persons of the
<hi>Quakers</hi> (many of whome I knew and did love and
honour) nor any foolish Passion of pride or bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
(for I desired to be sensible of my many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes
of <hi>my house of Clay,</hi> and other wayes) nor any
earthly or <hi>worldly ends</hi> I had that occasioned this
trouble to my self and them.</p>
            <p>I was first commanded this work from <hi>Heaven:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it.</note>
Why should not this Argument be good for mee
and for others as well as the <hi>Quakers?</hi> they say their
commands are immediate (for <hi>Interpretations</hi> are
<hi>immediate</hi>) but I say they herein suffer <hi>Satan</hi> to
cheat them; for they say they pray, they fast, they
wait, they listen, they judge of the motions that
arise within them, and so have I done. The great
maker and searcher of all hearts knowes, that none
but his holy <hi>Majesty</hi> was privy to the <hi>Conception</hi> of
this business.</p>
            <p>1. My end was,<note place="margin">My ends.</note> the vindicating his <hi>most holy
Name,</hi> which my Soul saw was trodden in the dirt
by <hi>Sathan</hi> clothed with <hi>Samuels Mantle,</hi> and the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43125:26"/>
bright garment of an <hi>Angel of Light,</hi> which once
he was, but pride deceived him.</p>
            <p>26] 2. I had in mine eye the vindicating this
<hi>Colony</hi> for receiving of such persons whome others
would not, we suffer for their sakes, and are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
their <hi>Abettors:</hi> that therefore together
with the improvemeut of our <hi>Libertyes</hi> which the
<hi>God of Heaven,</hi> and our <hi>Kings Majesty</hi> have gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
given us, I might give a publick testimony
against their <hi>Opinions</hi> in such a way and <hi>Exercise,</hi>
I judged it incumbent upon my <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
to doe it (in some regards) more than most
in the <hi>Colony.</hi> I may also truly say that</p>
            <p>3. I had also in mine eye,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nicholas Davis</hi> drowned at <hi>Newport</hi> a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Dispute.</hi>
               </note> that this exercise
might occasion some <hi>Soul Consideration</hi> in many. I
told them that we had a dolefull <hi>Alarum</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
lately, we were taught what <hi>Salvation</hi> and
<hi>saving</hi> was, in the late death and drowning of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
so known to us (and all <hi>N. England) Nicholas
Davis.</hi> I told them our case, and the case of all
mankind is his (in Spirituall and <hi>Soul matters) Oh a
world for an Oar, a Rope, a Plank.</hi> Only it must
be to all of us our work, to try whether our
<hi>Saviour</hi> our <hi>Salvation</hi> be reall, and not failing in so
great a Straight.</p>
            <p>Some of these blessed ends it hath pleased God
to propagate by this occasion all this <hi>Colony</hi> over,
and all of us round about have put forth our selves
in <hi>Disquisitions</hi> and Searchings after the true grounds
of the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> and <hi>Worship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had many thoughts of beginning such an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
with <hi>Prayer</hi> unto God for his Presence:<note place="margin">What Prayer was used.</note> but I
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43125:26"/>
knew I could not joyn with them nor would they
owne my <hi>Prayers:</hi> I had thoughts (as <hi>Eliah</hi> among
the <hi>Baalites</hi>) to have prayed in the singular number:
But some <hi>Considerations</hi> made my spirit content
with this kind of Petition unto God: For not only
in my <hi>Closet</hi> and my heart, but publickly before
them all I said, <hi>I doe humbly hope and beg of</hi> God
<hi>the</hi> Father <hi>of Spirits so to order and direct our Spirits
in these our Agitations, that his holy name may receive
glory, and the</hi> Soules <hi>of all of us some</hi> Soul-profit <hi>and
Advantage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I began with the first Position, which I think <hi>W.
Edmunson</hi> also read out of the Paper. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the People called Quakers are not true Quakers
according to the Scriptures.<note place="margin">The first <hi>Position.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>1. I said I knew they did not owne that name
<hi>Quakers,</hi> as imposed on them by God, or taken up
by themselves,<note place="margin">The name <hi>Quakers.</hi>
               </note> but given them in scorn and derision,
as <hi>G. Fox, Ed. Burrowes</hi> (and I had heard <hi>Iohn
Stubs</hi> who joined with them) declared, and that
27] one <hi>Gervace Bennet, a Iustice</hi> in <hi>Derby</hi> first
so called them in the year 1650 And yet I had
cause to judg that the name was given by <hi>Iustice
Bennet</hi> and others to them from that strange and
uncouth possessing of their bodyes. with quaking
and <hi>shaking</hi> of their <hi>Bodyes</hi> even in publick Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyes
and Congregations, which extraordinary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
I judged to come upon them, not from the
holy <hi>Spirit</hi> and Power of God, but from the spirit
and power of <hi>Sathan</hi> for diverse <hi>Reasons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First.</hi> Although they pretend that <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
and <hi>Habbacouck</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> were <hi>Quakers,</hi> yet
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43125:27"/>
as to the Christian Profession, and the dayes since
our gallant fore-Fathers in <hi>Germany</hi> (at <hi>Spiers</hi>) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
against the whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> and from that
<hi>Prostestation,</hi> by the <hi>Papists,</hi> they were called in

150 years since) unto this day.<note place="margin">The Rise of the word <hi>Protestant.</hi>
               </note> I say as to the
Protestant Professors and Confessors, the <hi>Quakers</hi>
are but a new upstart party or <hi>Faction</hi> risen up
little above 20 yeares since in the northern parts
of <hi>England, Lancashire &amp;c.</hi> Tis true, tis probable
they are the Offspring of the <hi>Grindletonians</hi> in the

                  <hi>The</hi> Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dletonians.</note> who held
those two grand Points (though many wicked paths
of <hi>Doctrine</hi> aud <hi>Practice</hi> were amongst them) <hi>viz.
1. That God doth all. 2 They could not sin,</hi> taking
it according to the Letter. These <hi>Grindletonians</hi>
were the Offspring of the late <hi>Nicholaitans,</hi> (as all
of them are in truth justly so called) from <hi>Henery
Nichols</hi> who put forth his Books of the same Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in <hi>K. Iames</hi> his time, (which long since I read)
and were confuted by many, and by Mr <hi>Ainsworth</hi>
and Mr <hi>Robinson,</hi> precious and powerfull <hi>Witnesses</hi>
of Christ Jesus. <hi>H. Nichols</hi> aud his <hi>Nicholaitans</hi>
were the Litter of those <hi>Spirittualls</hi> and <hi>Libertines</hi>

dayes;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The</hi> Lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertines.</note>
against whome that heavenly soul, gave his
powerfull and heavenly witness in his Book against
the <hi>Libertines.</hi> These <hi>Libertines</hi> Satan raised up
about the <hi>Protestant Reformation</hi> from the ruines
and rubbish of the old <hi>Manicheans</hi> and <hi>Gnosticks,</hi>
and other blind Guides who swarmed in the first
third and fourth Christian <hi>Centuryes,</hi> until the <hi>Pope</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:43125:27"/>
swallowed up all the lesser <hi>Serpents,</hi> and so became
a <hi>Dragon</hi> with seven Heads and ten Horns, forcing
all with fire and Fagot to deny <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and to
martch under Anti-Christ (the <hi>Anti-christ</hi> the man
of sin) his Colours.</p>
            <p>Some of these Particulars I could not then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
but think [28] fit here to remember the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
dayes, for Information of such as doe desire it.</p>
            <p>These People came from <hi>Lancashire</hi> and other
northern parts to the Southward of <hi>England</hi> and to
<hi>London.</hi> I spake with some of their Chief then in
<hi>London,</hi> I knew it was the old proud <hi>spirit</hi> which
had appeared in so many foul lyes in their former
deceived and deceiving <hi>Leaders,</hi> and I was the more
confirmed in my thoughts when I saw their foul
<hi>spirit</hi> so transport them, not only in lying <hi>Doctrines,</hi>
but lying <hi>Quakings</hi> and <hi>Tremblings,</hi> lying preaching
through the Streets <hi>Repent, Repent:</hi> and lying and
abominable <hi>Nakedness</hi> of men and women, untill
their ugly Child and Daughter <hi>Rantisme</hi> rose from
their Bowels and practised <hi>Nakedness</hi> of men and
women in the Streets and in their religious <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The</hi> Rant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>are but</hi> the Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>Daughter</hi>
               </note>
as <hi>Adamites:</hi> when it is notorioufly known
they fell into many <hi>uncleannesses</hi> and <hi>Adulteryes.</hi> To
my face and to the world in print they maintaind,
there were no sins in them: Saying <hi>That the Saints
could not sin, and God did all and was all,</hi> and they
were <hi>as pure as Adam and God himself,</hi> this is known
by the Writings extant <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Again I said unto my <hi>Antagonists</hi> that the
manner of these <hi>quakings</hi> and <hi>shakings</hi> were not as of
those <hi>quakings</hi> and tremblings of <hi>David, Moses,</hi> and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43125:28"/>
the <hi>Corinths</hi> receiving <hi>Titus</hi> with Trembling, or
the working out Salvation with <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Trembling:</hi>
               <note place="margin">True Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</note>
for that may many wayes be proved to be the <hi>Soul</hi>
and <hi>Spirit,</hi> out of a holy Aw and Dread of the
<hi>Majesty</hi> of Heaven with whome we have to deal,
who only can pitty and help us in our deplorable
and forlorn conditions: Hee it is who worketh
the <hi>Will</hi> and the <hi>Deed,</hi> and therefore with deep
impressions of <hi>Aw</hi> and <hi>Dread</hi> we ought to attend
upon all his holy meanes appointed, wherein (as of
old in the Tabernacle and Temple) he hath prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ised
to come to us. Beside, as it is naturall for the
Body to tremble when the mind doth, as we see in
many Persons in the beginning of a Battle, or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over a deep Water, or going to suffer Death,
or looking over a high <hi>Clift</hi> into the sea <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So
when the Bodies of those holy men, or any now
doe so tremble <hi>Experience</hi> proves it that it is no
ordinary motion, but extraordinary, and upon
extraordinary occasions, and those holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Occasions, as may be instanced.</p>
            <p>But the quaking and shaking motions of the
<hi>Quakers</hi> (as I shall prove) they proceeded not from
those holie Affections [29] proper to Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<note place="margin">The horrid <hi>shaking</hi> of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</hi>
               </note>
so also they were horrid and monstrous cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their bodies into horrid and monstrous motions
and Gestures which mine eyes have seen: Besides
the abundance of notorious Instances, what strange
horrid motions are those which <hi>Theora Iohn</hi> (as he
madly calls himself) and <hi>Iohn Toldervy</hi> were tost
and tumbled up and down with? which cannot
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43125:28"/>
be imagined to proceed from the holy <hi>Spirit of God,</hi>
but from Sathan to delude and cheat poor sinners
with.</p>
            <p>To this purpose I told them at the first coming
of this spirit to <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> some <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
men</hi> told me that themselves went to one
of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meetings about <hi>Charing Cross,</hi> but
were so affrighted with the <hi>shaking</hi> of their own
bodies, and of their <hi>Chairs</hi> and Stooles under them,
that they could never again be got into their <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I added,<note place="margin">Satans Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> that such <hi>Shakings, Motions, Extasies,
&amp;c.</hi> were known to be the frequent workings of
<hi>Sathan</hi> upon his Servants in all ages, Such were
the furious motions of <hi>Baals Preists,</hi> the motions
of the <hi>Possessed</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Gospells,</hi> and other
<hi>Historyes,</hi> and known to be amongst the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Answer.</note>
our Neighbours about this time. <hi>Iohn Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>
and <hi>William Edmunson</hi> rose up and said that I
had laid many deep and heavy <hi>Charges</hi> upon the
people of the Lord, which I should never be able
to prove: I had denied them to be <hi>Christians,</hi>
and so had wronged the good Spirit of God in
them, and their Profession of worshipping God in
the Spirit: Yea I had taken away their being (as
men) out of the World, as a dangerous People to
<hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>Kingdomes</hi> &amp; <hi>Common-weales,</hi> yea to
<hi>Kings</hi> &amp; <hi>Princes,</hi> and so not fit to live amongst
men in the World. These Speeches were often
uttered and enlarged by one or other of them,
and that with Zeal (and Passion in <hi>W. Edmunson</hi>)</p>
            <p>I waited patiently till these <hi>Gusts</hi> of their angry
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43125:29"/>
Spirit was over, and then I told them I had not
wronged them in a tittle: But by the help of the
most High I would make all good against them,
&amp; toen leave it to every mans and womens Soul
to judge at their own Perill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>About this time</hi> Iohn Stubs <hi>alleadged that of</hi>
Paul, <hi>Phil</hi> 2. Work out salvatson with fear and
Trembling.</p>
            <p>I replyed I in no way opposed the awfull and
most serious impressions of <hi>Gods Majesty</hi> in all his
appearances &amp; ordinances upon the Soules and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,<note place="margin">Quaking and Trembling</note>
yea and <hi>Bodyes</hi> of Gods Children. [30] But
I denied that those places to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and
<hi>Philippians</hi> concerned any such bodily shakings
and quakings as we now debated.</p>
            <p>Beside I said if <hi>Quaking</hi> and <hi>Trembling</hi> were a
Command and an Ordinance,<note place="margin">No Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God</note> and institution of
God to be practised, then was it constantly to be
practised (as the <hi>Iewes</hi> say of <hi>Cain</hi> that the Mark
which God set upon him was a constant <hi>Trembling</hi>)
Or if not alwayes, yet alwayes in <hi>Worship,</hi> or if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in <hi>Worship</hi> yet at some certain times. But
the plain truth is,<note place="margin">Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> and <hi>Trembling</hi>
               </note> the <hi>Devill</hi> will be <hi>Gods Ape</hi> in
most things: He subornes and substitutes a bastard
<hi>Quaking and Trembling</hi> of the body in Imitation of
<hi>David, Moses &amp;c.</hi> on purpose to thrust out the true
Fear and Trembling which ought to be constantly
in us, raising up all our Affections and all within
us to a due sence of the <hi>Terror</hi> of the Lord, the
dreadfulness of our <hi>Danger,</hi> and the wonder of our
<hi>Deliverance</hi> (which we can never make too sure)
from sin and wrath to come to all eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:43125:29"/>
I also declared, that the <hi>most High</hi> and holy one,
was free as he pleased to cause the trembling of the
<hi>Soules</hi> of his People to over flow with influence upon
their <hi>Bodyes</hi> also, asin <hi>Moses, David, Daniel, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuk,
Paul, &amp;c.</hi> this is like to be in some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
cases and <hi>Conversions</hi> or turnings to God, as
<hi>Paul</hi>'s was, and that especially in bringing of <hi>great
Sinners</hi> or <hi>old Sinners</hi> unto himself <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were some few Speeches, some from the
<hi>Governour</hi> and his Wife, and some few others that
spake, some in favor of, and some against the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
but neither did my Opposites nor I so far at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
them as to engage with them, excepting some
Turnes that were between <hi>William Edmunson,</hi> and
<hi>William Hitchcock</hi> (an Inhabitaut of <hi>Newport</hi>) who
(as others did) witnessed against their upbraiding
me with my age <hi>(Old man, Old man</hi> &amp;c.) as also
for their <hi>Interruptions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mine own Brother Mr <hi>Robert Williams,</hi> School-Master
in <hi>Newport,</hi> desired to speak: nor he nor
others dissenting from them could be permitted,
except they would set their hands to my Paper.<note place="margin">A Paper put in of two great <hi>Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
               </note>
My Brother (unknown to me) put in a paper to
them, which he took the liberty to read, desiring
that two things might be answered by the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
1. The matter of the true sence of <hi>Sin</hi> as Sin. 2.
Of the <hi>Materiallity</hi> of such a Person as the <hi>Lord
Iesus Christ,</hi> and the materiallity of his [31] <hi>Bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shedding.</hi>
This Paper they took but waved it. <hi>W.
Edmunson</hi> openly charged me with breach of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<hi>viz.</hi> That if any would speak on my behalf,
they should set their hand to my <hi>Propositions.</hi> Tis
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43125:30"/>
true it was desired by one of them at my house at
<hi>Providence,</hi> that if any joined with me, they should
subscribe to my Paper.<note place="margin">The une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall Termes of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining <hi>Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </note>
But I answered that I was
<hi>alone</hi> in the Business, I had not consulted with any
others but the God of heaven himself: so that I
denied vehemently that there was any such agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or any colour for it. Besides it was ridiculous
to put either such a <hi>Bar</hi> and Limit upon any mans
spirit, and least of all upon Gods <hi>Spirit, viz,</hi> that
no man should desire leave to object or querie <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
except first he would subscribe my <hi>Proposalls</hi> But
I took the boldness justly to charg them with pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
and gross <hi>Partiality</hi> viz. that <hi>W. Hitchcock</hi>
and others, (opposing or dissenting) might not speak,
but <hi>W. Harris, W. Dyar</hi> or any favouring of them
might speak without exception,<note place="margin">&amp; their open <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.</hi>
               </note> because all that
speak for their ptetended light, it must be supposed
that they speak from the Spirit of God himself:
others out of <hi>Ignorance, Malice and Envy:</hi> this will
appear more afterward.</p>
            <p>However, there were these few debates about the
liberty of speech in the Auditory and By-standers,
and the <hi>Quakers</hi> deniall and enjoining of <hi>Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
yet the most High, <hi>Father of Spirits</hi> did so
compose all spirits, that it was wonderfull that such
<hi>Opposites</hi> should goe through such a work and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slict
all day untill night, without more <hi>Interruptions</hi>
and <hi>Disturbances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was ready and waited to put forth my third
Reason to prove they were not true Christian Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
it was from Isai. 66. <hi>To this man will I look
that is poor and contrite, and trembleth at my</hi> Word. I
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43125:30"/>
told them that <hi>G. Fox</hi> in his Book all along was so
far from trembling at the <hi>Word of God</hi> in the holy
Writings or <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that he could not endure
they should have that name,<note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers evill spirit <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the holy</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> or be once called the
<hi>Word of God,</hi> Tis true I know his pretence, that
<hi>Christ Iesus</hi> is called the <hi>Word of God,</hi> Rev. 19.
But I know tis true also that he grants the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to be true, and inspired from the holy <hi>Spirit
of God,</hi> and to be Gods words, though not his <hi>Word.</hi>
Well, to pass by the simplicity of the <hi>Distinction,</hi>
and let us take what he grants, and is it not prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and monstrous Contempt that these holy Words,
this holy Book and Writing of God should be so
undervalued and slighted,<note place="margin">The Light of each man in the World above the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
               </note> yea vilified [32] and nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified,
if compar'd with their pretended <hi>new found
Light</hi> within them, which was (say they) before the
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> and gave forth the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was above the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and gave forth the
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> and therefore was above the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
and therefore is not judged or tried by the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
but they by it. Yea, and this light must be
in every one of mankind in the whole World:
Hence it was that these holy Writings were so
disused in their own private Readings, in their
Publick Worship,<note place="margin">The <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Quakers</hi> great affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ownness against the holy <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
               </note>
and in their Families.</p>
            <p>I told them God was little beholding to the <hi>Pope</hi>
and the <hi>Quakers</hi> for their humble Reverence and
great Affection to his holy <hi>Letters, Declarations</hi> and
<hi>Proclamations.</hi> The Pope had his <hi>Infallibility</hi> as
well as they, his immediate <hi>Inspirations</hi> as well
as they: They both owned, and yet did not owne
the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> the Pope and they only must
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:43125:31"/>
interpret <hi>Scriptures,</hi> they only give the <hi>Sence,</hi> they
only judge all <hi>Controversies:</hi> yea they dispence with
the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and if they were quite lost and
burn'd and not a Copy of them left in the World,
yet there were no loss but a good Turn, a good Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
for then the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Quakers Infallible
spirit</hi> and its immediate <hi>Inspirations,</hi> would be more
esteemed and set by.</p>
            <p>I produced an Instance of one <hi>Thurston</hi> an Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of theirs who came to <hi>Providence</hi> with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
long hair hanging over his shoulders;<note place="margin">An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a long-haird profane <hi>Qua. slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nature</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
               </note> It
was so long that an aged Soul (captivated for
present amongst them) the wife of <hi>C.S.</hi> demanded
of him why he ware it so long since Nature it
self did teach it to be a shame for a man to wear
<hi>long Hair,</hi> as the <hi>holy Scripture</hi> affirmed? He would
not say, He car'd not what <hi>Nature</hi> or the holy
<hi>Scriptures</hi> said, but he said as much in effect (as she
told me her self, and may with true fear and tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
still think on it) <hi>viz.</hi> when that God that bid
me wear it, bids me cut it off, the will I cut it off.
As if he would say, what tell you us of the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of <hi>Nature</hi> (as we see in that monstrous case
of their womens <hi>Nakedness</hi>) or what tell you me of
Scripture? I have a <hi>Light</hi> within me that made
that <hi>Light,</hi> was before it, gave it forth, &amp; is above
it. This mans hair was so offensive and odious,
that meeting of me, and saying, <hi>Fear the Lord God,</hi>
I could not but answer him in these words, <hi>viz.
What God dost thou mean a Ruffians God?</hi> alluding to
that of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus, They profess to know God, but
in their Works they deny him.</hi>

33] I told them the rage of the Devill in all Ages
had been most fierce against these heavenly <hi>Records,</hi>
in which the most gracious God and King, out of
the infinite depths of his Wisdome and Goodness,
had provided for the Ages and Generations to come
the glorious <hi>Appearances</hi> of the eternall <hi>Invisible

<hi>stampt</hi> upon it with his feet saying, <hi>A Plague of God

among us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether I spake all these Particulars at one indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall
time or Turn I cannot clearly remember,
only I am certain thus I spake and more.</p>
            <p>My Opposites once and again had Turnes of
Speech, but still the only sum of all was, that they
owned the <hi>Scripture,</hi> but yet the <hi>Spirit</hi> that gave it
forth was above it, withall they urged that I could
not prove where in the Scripture, the <hi>Scripture</hi> was
called <hi>the Word of God.</hi>

               </note> That many things were infallibly

Words mentioned: But yet there were abundance
of <hi>Scriptures</hi> wherin the <hi>Prophets</hi> did expresly say,

               <hi>Thus saith the Lord, The Word of the Lord came unto

the <hi>Word of God</hi> is the Word preached, as <hi>Paul,</hi> 2

the</hi> Word <hi>of God, Act.</hi> 19 which preaching of the
Word &amp; growing of the word were not compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

perfon of the <hi>Lord Iesus;</hi> especially I told them I
would use the words of the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> when he

No other Weapon did he use against him but <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>It is written,</hi> and again, <hi>It is written, It is written,</hi>
here <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> quotes <hi>Dut 8. Man shall not live
by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of
the mouth of God:</hi> where <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Christ Iesus</hi>
affirm [34] that God hath many words, contrary to
what some <hi>Quakers</hi> hath affirmed to me saying, <hi>that
God hath no more words but one,</hi> and <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> here
affirmeth, That every appearance and providence
of God, is a word proceeding out of the mouth of
<hi>God,</hi> as well as this holy Scripture he alleadged.
Though yet it is true, that <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> is the <hi>Word,</hi>
or declared Mind of <hi>God,</hi> incomparably above all his
<hi>spoken</hi> or <hi>written</hi> or <hi>providentiall</hi> Words and Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
He came out of the <hi>Bosome</hi> of the <hi>Eternal
Father,</hi> and brought the brightest Revelations of
his eternal <hi>God-head</hi> &amp; <hi>Councels,</hi> and therefore is
most justly and eminently stiled the <hi>Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I urged that the <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Words</hi> of God were
<hi>Figurative</hi> Speeches, for properly God had no <hi>Mouth,</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:43125:32"/>
nor <hi>Tongue,</hi> nor <hi>Lips,</hi> nor <hi>Heart</hi> nor <hi>Brains &amp;c.</hi> but
as our Kings Majesty his <hi>Declaration</hi> touching <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
his royal <hi>Charters,</hi> his <hi>Letters</hi> from <hi>Breda</hi> are
often insisted on and urged by the <hi>Quakers</hi> as the
word of a King, though his writings contain many
hundred words; so it is with the <hi>King of Heaven</hi> his
<hi>Scriptures</hi> and writings <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had oft occasion to mention <hi>G. Fox</hi> and <hi>Ed. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes</hi>
their <hi>Book</hi> in Folio called <hi>The great Mystery</hi>
&amp;c. upon which <hi>W Edmundson</hi> reproved me for
speaking of <hi>G. Fox</hi> and <hi>E. Burrowes</hi> in scorn and
derision (so his words were) I guest he took me as
if I had scornfully intended <hi>G Fox</hi> in his <hi>Burrowes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Title</hi> of this <hi>Book.</hi>
               </note>
but I had openly purged my self, protesting before
the Lord, that I had no such thought, yet this Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
was the occasion of the <hi>Title</hi> of the <hi>Book:</hi> For
the finger of <hi>Gods</hi> most wise and holy Providence
is often wonderfully seen in small, unexpected &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
Turns and Occasions: In such poor
<hi>shells</hi> oftimes may be found the <hi>Kernels</hi> of rich
and usefull <hi>Observations.</hi> Sure (thought I) Gods
holy Finger is in it, that <hi>G. Fox</hi> and <hi>Ed. Burrowes</hi>
(Men so qualified and named) should so notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oufly
conspire against the true <hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi> in
their dark and subtle hellish Contrivings and <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</hi>
It was also Gods overruling hand that
<hi>VV. Edmundson</hi> should so upbraid me, and first put
the <hi>Conceit</hi> and thought of such a Consideration in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, which I apprehended as <hi>Digitus Dei</hi> the
finger of God directing and pointing me to so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and pertinent an use and Application.</p>
            <p>Thus the only Wise and Righteous <hi>King</hi> catcheth
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43125:33"/>
the craftiest <hi>Foxes</hi> in their own <hi>Burrowes,</hi> and turns
their proud Surmises &amp; Censures upon their own
<hi>Pates.</hi> This occasioneth me with Amaze- [35] ment
and Astonishment to cry out <hi>O God how deep are thy</hi>
Being, <hi>thy</hi> Attributes, <hi>thy</hi> Providences, <hi>thy</hi> Self <hi>and
all thy wayes beyond our thoughts and finding out!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To proceed, I had observed and prepared many
<hi>Quotations</hi> out of <hi>G. Fox</hi> his Book, but they desired
not to hear them read, as in the following dayes of
<hi>Conference</hi> they were read by my continual importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Urgings: I say at first I could not get opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to insist upon some Particulars, a Tast whereof
I think now fit to present the Reader with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In</hi> Page 155. <hi>of</hi> G. Foxes <hi>aforesaid Book he brings
in one</hi> I Stallam <hi>their Opposite saying</hi> [To say the
Light in every man gave forth <hi>Scripture,</hi> and will open
<hi>Scripture</hi> to us, is palpable <hi>Darkness,</hi> and contradicts

for the <hi>Light</hi> lets them see to what it was spoken, and

            <p>The english of that Answer is,<note place="margin">

               </note> That every man,
that is all <hi>Mankind</hi> Men and Women if they will,

               <note place="margin">Pertinent <hi>Queryes</hi> and unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable.</note> I asked them in publick [Since this

come into the house discern and see it: <hi>Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
saith, <hi>as the mouth is, the heart is, and before a

darkness, we hate the light of <hi>God</hi> and endure not

that they will tell us that we have <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> in the same Page <hi>G. Fox</hi> brings his Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
saying, <hi>[And to say every mans</hi> Light <hi>is the true</hi>
word of Prophecy <hi>is</hi> an old Fable, <hi>no man shall be

<hi>[The Light that enlightens every man is</hi> Christ, <hi>and
the sure</hi> Word of Prophecy <hi>to him he shall find it]</hi>
In this Passage who can but see their <hi>horrible</hi> and
<hi>simple</hi> profaning and wresting of plain <hi>Scripture:</hi>
Is it not clear as day to him that is not willingly
<hi>blind,</hi> that this <hi>word of prophecy</hi> in <hi>Peter,</hi> is the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43125:34"/>
Word which the <hi>Prophets</hi> spake and writ of <hi>Christ
Iesus,</hi> unto whome the spirit of God in <hi>Peter</hi> sends
us, as being a more sure and convincing <hi>word</hi> to us
then that voice which <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> affirmed that
they heard from heaven in the Mount of <hi>Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?</hi>
But thus <hi>profanely</hi> and <hi>simply</hi> do others of
them affirm this <hi>Light</hi> to be that <hi>Prophet</hi> which
<hi>Moses</hi> wrote of, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. whereas the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> in
<hi>Stephen Acts</hi> 7. applyes expresly that <hi>Prophesie</hi> to
the person of the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> that <hi>God-man</hi> in one
person, whome <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi> preached the

and <hi>King</hi> unto all that receive or believe in him.</p>
            <p>Now diverse observing and publickly expressing

in most admirable <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Method,</hi> so I had
thought that (according as I writ and spake to
them) they would have had so much <hi>Ingenuity</hi> to
conceive, that nor I nor any man was so simple as
to offer to Dispute with, to oppose and to answer
twenty or thirty or one hundred at once: But thus
like subtle and impudent <hi>Foxes</hi> and <hi>Iesuites</hi> they

            <p>Sometimes I offered to proceed to an other <hi>Point,</hi>
but all this first day was spent upon the first <hi>Point</hi>
of <hi>true</hi> and <hi>false Quakers:</hi> For though many upon
a sudden spake as <hi>Mr. Coddington Mr. Easton</hi> (then
Governour, who spake sharply) <hi>VVilliam Dyer,
VVilliam Harris</hi> and others against me, yet I
minded closely what my <hi>Antagonists</hi> vented, who
were placed on high in their <hi>Desk</hi> against me: <hi>Iohn
Stubs</hi> and <hi>Iohn Burnet</hi> were more sober and manly,
but <hi>VV. Edmundson</hi> (who was the junior of three)
would speak all like <hi>Solomons</hi> foolish woman, <hi>loud</hi>
and <hi>clamorous, simple</hi> and <hi>knowing nothing,</hi> being in
truth nothing but a <hi>flash</hi> of wit, a <hi>Face of Brass,</hi>
and a <hi>Tongue</hi> set on <hi>fire</hi> from the <hi>Hell of Lyes and
Fury.</hi>

One <hi>Instance</hi> here fell out, for when I urged that
it was not what man had <hi>within him</hi> already, and
brought into the world with him, that made a true
<hi>Quaker,</hi> but the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> accompanying and
blessing the <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Hearing</hi> of the <hi>writings</hi>
of <hi>God preached</hi> and <hi>opened:</hi> I said the <hi>Heart</hi> of man
was shut up lockt and barr'd up in <hi>willing Ignorance</hi>
and <hi>darkness</hi> until the <hi>finger of God</hi> in the use of
those and other blessed meanes, <hi>pick</hi> open in a more
gentle way, or <hi>break</hi> open by great afflictions and
and <hi>terrours</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of man. I said
that <hi>Paul</hi> preached the <hi>word</hi> by the River side, but
the Lord opened the heart of <hi>Lydia:</hi> and while I
was saying that, <hi>It was not Paul nor Pauls Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nor the word that he preached</hi>—at this word
<hi>VV. Edmondson</hi> clamour'd out, <hi>He speakes Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:</hi>
But it pleased God to move the heart of our
<hi>Deputy-Governour</hi> Capt. <hi>Cranston</hi> justly and seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to witness against this <hi>Interruption</hi> saying,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>W. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondsoo</hi> justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Capt. <hi>Cranston</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Let
him have liberty to make out his mind:</hi> So I proceeded
and said, it may be <hi>VV. Edmnndson</hi> is offended as
thinking I spoke against the <hi>word Christ;</hi> but <hi>Christ
Iesus</hi> knowes that I had no such thought, but of the
words which <hi>Paul</hi> spake. And I added that it was
not <hi>Lydia</hi> nor all her <hi>Light</hi> within her, nor <hi>Paul</hi>
nor [38] his <hi>Preaching,</hi> nor the <hi>word</hi> nor <hi>words</hi>
that he uttered, but the Finger of <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Election</hi>) that set the <hi>word</hi> or <hi>words</hi> of
<hi>Paul</hi> home, opening her <hi>heart,</hi> and not every heart,
(shewing what free grace is against the <hi>Popish</hi> and
<hi>Arminian</hi> and <hi>Foxians</hi> exalting of <hi>Cursed Nature</hi>)
and then it was that she being by the Lord turned,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43125:35"/>
she turned to attend &amp; apply to her soul the words
which were spoken by <hi>Paul,</hi> as a poor <hi>Rams-horn</hi>
made use of in the hand of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Toward the end of the day <hi>VV. Edmondson</hi> fell
into a long <hi>Invective,</hi> how I had falsly slandered
the <hi>People of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians boast of their Number.</note> not only in this place, but the
whole Body of the People of the <hi>Lord</hi> called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
in all parts: For said he we are a great people,
many thousands in <hi>England,</hi> many thousands in
<hi>London,</hi> besides in <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Barbadoes</hi> and other
places, and <hi>N-England.</hi> And he and they said, hast
thou any more to say to make out thy <hi>Lyes</hi>
against them.</p>
            <p>I Answered (as at other times) that the <hi>Papists</hi>
the common <hi>Protestants,</hi> the <hi>Iews</hi> and the <hi>Mahumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
and <hi>Pagans, &amp;c.</hi> fited the world with their
<hi>Numbers,</hi> and yet we jointly opposed them in <hi>Relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious
matters</hi> notwithstanding their <hi>innumerable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:</hi>
And as for more proof that they were not
<hi>True Quakers,</hi> and so truly <hi>Feariug and Tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
before <hi>God,</hi> I told them I would produce an
Argument, that they were so far from being <hi>Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians,</hi>
that they were a to be <hi>exploded</hi> and <hi>abhorred</hi>
of all <hi>Mankind,</hi> as being fallen beneath the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>temper</hi> and <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Humanity</hi> of men
and women, yea of the Savage and <hi>Barbarous</hi> in
the world, <hi>viz.</hi> their stripping <hi>stark naked</hi> their
<hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Maidens</hi> and passing along in
publick places and <hi>Streets</hi> unto the <hi>Assemblyes of
Men</hi> and <hi>Youths</hi> and so were beheld and gazed
upon by them! and this under a pretence of being
stirred up by God as a <hi>Service</hi> or <hi>Worship</hi> unto
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43125:36"/>
God, as an act of <hi>Christian Religion</hi> proceeding from
the immediate moving of the most holy <hi>Spirit of
God,</hi> most glorious in purity, and purity and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
it self.</p>
            <p>At first <hi>W. Edmundson</hi> seemed to make strange
of the matter as if it could not be proved that any
of their women should so appear in the <hi>Assemblyes</hi>
of People.<note place="margin">Two of the Foxian women na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in <hi>New England.</hi>
               </note> I told them the matter of <hi>fact</hi> was so
<hi>notorious</hi> that it would be loss of time and <hi>Impudence</hi>
to question it, being so fouly and openly <hi>practised</hi>
both in <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>39] Also I added further, that <hi>G. Bishop</hi> of <hi>Bris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tow,</hi>
one of themselves, in the second part of the
<hi>Persecutions of New-England,</hi> relates in print the
names of two women in <hi>N-England</hi> that did so
practice: and he complains of <hi>N-England Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi>
because those women suffered <hi>Whipping for</hi>
those actions by the <hi>Courts</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> of <hi>N-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn Burnet</hi> said that the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi>
were a People known to abhor all <hi>Impurity</hi> and
Uncleanness and the <hi>Appearance</hi> of it, and if any
of their women should so practice, they should
condemn it in them, yet nevertheless if it should
please the <hi>Lord God</hi> to stir up any of his <hi>Daughters</hi>
so to appear as a <hi>Sign</hi> and <hi>Testimony</hi> against the
<hi>Nakedness</hi> of others, they durst not condemn it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn Stubs</hi> said, that they did condemn all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modest
<hi>Appearances</hi> in women, both in <hi>Behaviour</hi>
and <hi>Gestures.</hi> But if God stirred them up and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to this service to discover the <hi>Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of others, they could not but acknowledge
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43125:36"/>
               <hi>Gods</hi> hand, and submit to it: And he further added,
that it was a great <hi>Cross</hi> to a sober womans spirit
so to act, as well as an affliction and suffering to
her body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn Stubs</hi> likewise alleadged the <hi>Prophet Isaiah,</hi>
(as also did <hi>W. E.</hi>) and the <hi>Sign</hi> of the Prophet <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel:</hi>
and <hi>Iohn Stubs</hi> read the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>Isa.</hi> where
<hi>Isaiah</hi> was commanded to goe <hi>naked</hi> for a <hi>Sign</hi> to
the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Ethyopians,</hi> to prophesie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
that they also should go naked with their
buttocks uncovered as the words are: and this is
(said they) a proof that the People of the Lord
might be stirred up by <hi>God</hi> to such actions for <hi>Signs</hi>
unto others.<note place="margin">Isai. 20 <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed touching</hi> Nakedness</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Answered,</hi> that this was in the dayes of <hi>Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures</hi>
and <hi>Signs,</hi> Shadows and <hi>Ceremonyes:</hi> And
though this was <hi>G. Fox</hi> his Answer (in his Book
which I had there by me) yet <hi>G. Fox</hi> throughout
all this his Book in <hi>Folio,</hi> turns of the Allegations
and Arguments of many of his <hi>Opposites</hi> with this
Answer, <hi>to wit, The</hi> Substance <hi>is come, the</hi> Body <hi>is
come,</hi> Christ <hi>the</hi> End <hi>of the</hi> Law, <hi>the</hi> End <hi>of the</hi>
Command, <hi>the</hi> End <hi>of the</hi> Scriptures, <hi>the</hi> End <hi>of the</hi>
Prophets, <hi>and of all</hi> Signs <hi>and</hi> Shadows <hi>and</hi> Figures.</p>
            <p>2. Although it were so threatned that the <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opians</hi>
and <hi>Egyptians</hi> should so goe <hi>totally</hi> and <hi>stark
Naked,</hi> and that <hi>Isaiah</hi> did so, which is much ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned:
yet it is not to be questioned but that the
<hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians</hi> in their flight, would
cover [40] their <hi>Secret parts</hi> with the first cloaths
or raggs they could get, as it is no question but the
Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> did.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:43125:37"/>
3. The difference of <hi>Nakedness</hi> of <hi>Mankind</hi> and
<hi>Womankind</hi> is very great in all <hi>Nations.</hi> The <hi>Sex</hi>
of <hi>Women</hi> is more fitted and framed by God for a
<hi>Covering,</hi> for <hi>Retiredness</hi> and keeping at home and
for <hi>Modesty</hi> and <hi>Bashfulness;</hi> nor do we ever read
that ever God commanded such a thing to Women,
or that ever it came into his heart, or that ever any
<hi>Godly Woman</hi> did so practice: there is no shadow
or colour of <hi>Proof</hi> from the holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor from
any <hi>Civill</hi> and sober People, no nor from the naked
<hi>Barbarians</hi> themselves, who though they suffer their
<hi>Male Children</hi> to go naked till about seven years old,
yet cover they their <hi>Females</hi> from their birth: Tis
true it is said in <hi>Brasil</hi> and other bruitish places
some <hi>Savage bruits</hi> go so, but they are <hi>Canibals,
Men-eaters, &amp;c.</hi> and other <hi>Barbarians</hi> do not so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in <hi>Drunkenness</hi> and <hi>Madness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They still answered, that they would not <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance</hi>
any such <hi>Practice</hi> but if the <hi>Lord God</hi> so
commanded his <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters</hi> it must be
obeyed.</p>
            <p>I demanded of them how it should be known
that it was the voice and command of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>God</hi>
of <hi>Holiness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The true voice of God, and many false and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</note> and not the command of the unclean
<hi>spirit?</hi> for I told them that under that Cover that
one of them might be so commanded, and sent of
God in such a posture and behaviour amongst men,
why might not ten or twenty, yea all the women
in this present <hi>Assembly</hi> be so stirred up as it were
by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to the horror and amazement
of the whole <hi>Countrey</hi> yea of the whole <hi>World?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They seemed to me to be <hi>Confounded</hi> with this
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43125:37"/>
Argumnet and weary to hear of it,<note place="margin">Imme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that it was true in former Dispensations. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God came to <hi>Abraham</hi> to kill his own

seem as horrible <hi>unnatural</hi> and <hi>cruel,</hi> as this <hi>Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uess</hi>
of the Women unwomanly and <hi>unnatural.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>1. It was in the day and dispensation of such
wonderfull <hi>Signs</hi> and figurative teachings unto men.</p>
            <p>And 2. I said <hi>God</hi> did furnish them with a Spir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
of discerning the <hi>true</hi> dream from the false, the
true voice from the false, the voice of <hi>God</hi> from the
voice of <hi>Sathan:</hi> But in our day wherein God had
altered his Dispensations and Revelations which
he [41] used to the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and had spoken to us
by his <hi>Son,</hi> and had left his mind both in the <hi>old</hi>
and <hi>new Scriptures</hi> or Writings: We have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
and President of the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> that is, to
attend to the holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> only, and to use the
weapon of <hi>[It is written it is written]</hi> against <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi>
immediate <hi>Inspirations</hi> and temptations.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>W. Edmondson</hi> fel into a great heat against
me and said that I spoke <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> in saying that
<hi>Abraham</hi> and the <hi>Saints</hi> then had a way and Spirit
of discerning the Spirits which we had not, imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Gods Spirit was not the same: He added,
that I had kept them long and had proved nothing,
and yet we had not done with the first <hi>Position.</hi> I
replyed, that I had produced such <hi>Grounds</hi> as should
never be shaken, and that I presumed did appear to
the <hi>Consciences</hi> of many, and I heartily desired might
also appear unto their Spirits, Soules, and <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:43125:38"/>
Some of the Auditors spake to this Purpose,

            </p>
            <p>And thus by Gods <hi>Mercy</hi> and Patience the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the first day ended: which very day was
notable and <hi>significant</hi> as to the created <hi>Sun</hi> in the

who in the midst of our Contest was

my great unfitness for this dayes Service: for
thus it was, My continued <hi>loud Speech</hi> all the day

            </p>
            <p>I began and stood up and said, the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

that all our <hi>Arrowes</hi> might fly one way, to wit in

of a <hi>Christ</hi> made up of the <hi>Godhead</hi> and their <hi>flesh,</hi>
I said they had set up a Christ within them which

saith he is <hi>Christs Vicar</hi> and <hi>Lieftenant,</hi> and he doth
all for <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Iesuites</hi> (soaring above all

that we are <hi>bone</hi> of his bone and <hi>flesh</hi> of his flesh,

God and Man is within us, that his Birth, his Life, his

wrought within us,</hi> so that like the <hi>Oracles</hi> of <hi>Apollo,</hi>
and the <hi>Ecchoes</hi> of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> say
<hi>Christ was born at Bethlehem</hi> and dyed at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
but intend in truth and reallity no other <hi>birth</hi> nor

            <p>To this purpose I told them that <hi>Humphrey Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>

Christ God and is not God a Spirit? you look for a

Christ, and that he did consist and still doth of body
and soul (as we doe) then you are gone from, (and

Christ Jesus, and it perpetuated and continues to
<hi>Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I told them that (as the holy Scripture saith)
they preached not <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> but <hi>Themselves,</hi> yea
they preached the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> to be <hi>Themselves:</hi>
that whatever were their Pretencse (as the <hi>Papists</hi>)
of <hi>God &amp; Christ &amp; Holiness &amp; Mortification,</hi> yet
they held not the <hi>Head</hi> (as the Scripture speaks) and
if their head be but a painted and an <hi>Imaginary
Head,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christ.</note> they are but a painted and Imaginary <hi>Body.</hi>
Their <hi>Sun</hi> of Righteousness they talk of is but a

            </p>
            <p>I told them they set up this <hi>Christ</hi> within, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to <hi>Christ</hi> without, as <hi>Opposites &amp; Contraryes,
Denying &amp; Destroying</hi> one an other: for as it is with
a <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Palace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Christ winhin and Christ without.</note> if his <hi>person</hi> be without, his
<hi>person</hi> at that time is not within, though he be
within by his <hi>Right, Authority</hi> and <hi>Influence:</hi> if his
Person be within the Palace at that time it is not
without. But the most clear Truth is though
these subtle <hi>Foxians</hi> sometimes speak of a Christ
without that dyed at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> agreeing with the
Christ within, yet they presently declare their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be <hi>Mystical:</hi> For ask them but these two
<hi>Questions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Two Ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Quakers.</note> and if they make any <hi>Answer</hi> you will see
the <hi>Cheat,</hi> the <hi>Equivocotion</hi> and the <hi>Mistery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>
in it.</p>
            <p>1. Do they not hold the <hi>Light</hi> within every
man to be <hi>All,</hi> to <hi>doe All</hi> and to <hi>suffer All</hi> within
which the Christ without, <hi>Is</hi> or <hi>Did</hi> or <hi>suffered</hi>
without.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:43125:42"/>
2. Ask them now what is become of this <hi>Man,</hi>
this person that thus suffered at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and they
are forced to confess he [47] is within, and can give
no other account of him, as they answered to me at
<hi>Newport</hi> the last day of the Conference.</p>
            <p>But to return, I told them what I said I would
prove out of their <hi>Writings,</hi> and especially out of
<hi>G. Fox</hi> attested by <hi>Ed Burrowes</hi> his large <hi>Epistle,</hi>
and as it was thought by <hi>Iohn Stubs</hi> present.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn Burnet</hi> declared not, (nor any of them)
against what I spake: but said (as said the rest) if <hi>G.
Fox</hi> have spoken or written any thing that is not
right and <hi>truth,</hi> we profess not to follow him: and
they were willing I should produce out of <hi>G.
Fox</hi> his Book what I could that might make for
my proof, <hi>viz.</hi> That they did not profess the <hi>true
Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I said <hi>G: Fox</hi> had pickt out some particular Lines,
Sayings &amp; Sentences out of the Books and Writings

<hi>Answer</hi> what he chose and <hi>cull'd</hi> out) and since they
were free and willing, I would produce some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances:
I took up the Book and read in the 3d. <hi>page,</hi>
where he brings in his <hi>Opposite Samuel Eaton</hi> saying
[The Saints have not Christ in the <hi>Flesh]</hi> G. F. his
Answer is <hi>[Contrary to</hi> Christ and the Apostles
<q>
                  <hi>Doctrine, who said they were of his</hi> Flesh, <hi>and of his</hi>
Bone, <hi>and should eat his</hi> Flesh, <hi>and they that eat his</hi>
Flesh <hi>have it in them.]</hi>
               </q> Whence I affirmed that
Christ Jesus had such a Body as might be really and
materially in the Saints, and ii was clear that they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:43125:43"/>
were one with the <hi>Papists</hi> in their Sayings and
<hi>Doctrines</hi> denying the Flesh, Body and Person of
Christ Jesus: For as the <hi>Papists</hi> in stead of a <hi>Sprit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual</hi>
feeding upon his <hi>bloud</hi> and Merits,<note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists &amp; Quakers destroy the Person of Christ.</note> they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
and bring in a <hi>Real, Material</hi> and Carnal, in
their horrible and fantastical <hi>Transubstantiation;</hi> so
do the <hi>Quakers</hi> professing to eat Christ <hi>spiritually,</hi>
wholy destroy his <hi>material</hi> and fleshly being.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I proceeded saying, in the</hi> 4th Page G. Fox <hi>brings
in the same Opposite saying,</hi> The Saints do not see
<hi>Christ, the Heavens contain him. And</hi> G. F. <hi>Ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers</hi>
               <q>And the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith they sate with <hi>Christ</hi>
in <hi>heavenly places:</hi> so he is contrary to the <hi>Apostle,</hi>
and <hi>Christ</hi> was in them and walked in them, and <hi>God</hi>
dwelt in them and <hi>Christ</hi> in you except you be Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates.</q>
               <hi>I said that as the</hi> Papists <hi>were up</hi> ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
&amp; odiously <hi>with</hi> Hoc est Corpus meum,<note place="margin">The being of Christ in the Heavens</note> This is
my Body <hi>&amp;c. so they with</hi> The Light within you, the
Light that enlightens every man, <hi>Christ</hi> within you
except you be <hi>Reprobates</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>48] For if the Heavens do contain that Man Christ
Jesus bodily, (as they grant in word) saying They
believed he <hi>dyed, rose,</hi> and <hi>ascended:</hi> then in that
same sence and respect the Saints cannot now sit
bodily with Christ in heavenly places, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to alledge <hi>Christ</hi> within, and their sitting with
<hi>Christ</hi> in heavenly places, was but irrational <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi>
and Jesuitical <hi>Equivocation:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is they were gravel'd with these <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,</hi>
and they were willing that <hi>G Fox</hi> his
book and his Answers should answer for them,<note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers endure not trying but are willingly ignorant.</note> and
although the oppositions of <hi>G. Fox</hi> his Opposites
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43125:43"/>
were mighty, and <hi>G Foxes</hi> were meer simple <hi>bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
of dogs or foxes compar'd with the rational
and prudential Answers of a man, yet when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to open and compare the <hi>Assertions</hi> of the

(especially <hi>W E.</hi> like a <hi>galled horse</hi> winching) <hi>Why
dost thou make thy</hi> Observations <hi>upon</hi> G. Fox <hi>his
words?</hi> G. Fox <hi>his words need not thy</hi> Expositions, <hi>let</hi>
G. Fox <hi>his words alone they are able to speak for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I told them it was a senceless business for me to
alleadge, (and they to be willing I should) <hi>G. Fox</hi>
his sayings and his <hi>Answers,</hi> and we should not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
and discuss the <hi>Sence,</hi> and I make out my Proof
out of <hi>G. Fox</hi> his words, and his <hi>Adversaryes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
together: when they had spoken they knew
their liberty to take of my <hi>Answers</hi> with their own,
and leave what was spoke to every ones Conscience
in the sight of God.</p>
            <p>They were <hi>Obstinately</hi> (that is in <hi>Greek Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi>)
resolved to avoid this Course,<note place="margin">Willing Ignorance.</note> therefore I was

            <p>In <hi>Foxes</hi> Answer to his Opposite <hi>Daniel Caudry</hi>

<hi>Iohn Stubs</hi> said the <hi>Hebrew word</hi> was <hi>[Abi Haad,</hi>

that it was rendred (and that more near the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew)

my self and better too: I was about to say that they
were wonderfully altered and changed from their
former principles and practises, for heretofore they
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43125:54"/>
have professed to me that they had no need of
Books, no not of the Scripture it self, for they had
the Teacher within them that gave forth Scripture,
&amp;c. if now they were perswaded to study the Holy
Scripture and the Translation of it, and to examine
the Translations and the Copies of them, then they
did err and sin before, (which they say the Saints can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not)
in so wonderfully neglecting and slighting
them as useless and needless things.</p>
            <p>Yea the truth is if their Light be so Alsufficient

            <p>I know their Pretences of becoming <hi>All to All</hi>

still but as the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> which the <hi>Apostles</hi>
dispensed with for a season: they care no more for
the Scriptures then the <hi>Papists</hi> do, they are forced
to make use of them for an end, but all their hope
is in their <hi>Interpretations,</hi> which both <hi>Papists and

(more or less) and he that complained how I took
up time, now (tediously) made us all to hear a Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which he said he knew himself of one of the
Priests that lived not many miles from the place
where <hi>W. Edmund.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>W. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund.</hi> his story concerning Benefices</note> lived, who told with his own

a good <hi>Benefice,</hi> another <hi>Priest</hi> of his acquaintance
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43125:55"/>
came to visit him, whom he entertained kindly, and
this his Guest told him, that he was going to the

<hi>Priest</hi> the <hi>Host</hi> was afterward informed that this
treacherous and ungrateful Guest, did use all the
art he could with the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> (or <hi>Dublin</hi>)
to get his Friends (that had entertained him) his
Living from him.</p>
            <p>2. The second part of his Sermon was (as usually
it is of all their Sermons) an extolling and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of that Light which [63] he said had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to him, which he advanced as the Principle
and the Foundation, the Light, &amp;c. he added how
they had left all the Glory and Pleasures of the
World for this Light:<note place="margin">And his vain extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their Idol <hi>Light</hi>
               </note> and how they had endured
and suffered much for Preaching this Light to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
and ungrateful men, who had ill requited
them: for their Message and Work was only to
bring good News unto them, to tell them that they
should be free from sin and have Christ Jesus live
and dwell in them. I kept silence until this famous
<hi>Apostle</hi> and <hi>Preacher</hi> of <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> had done this
Speech or Sermon which he said <hi>he</hi> was moved in
his heart to make unto them &amp; (as he often said) to
give an account of his Faith which he performed
with very great zeal and fervency, both of mind
and body.</p>
            <p>I had thought then to have spoke,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>John Stubs</hi> his sermon</note> but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<hi>Io. Stubs</hi> stood up being moved (as he said)
to Declare his mind and Thoughts unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
also, and so he began a large <hi>Oration, Speech</hi> or
<hi>Sermon</hi> also (though not so long as <hi>William Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundsons</hi>)
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43125:55"/>
he declared how pleasant a thing the
Light was, and how pleasant a thing it was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
it? And he said, <hi>are you angry because we bring
you the Tidings of the Light?</hi> This was the principle,
this was the <hi>Foundation</hi> of all, the <hi>Light, &amp;c.</hi> He
<hi>added</hi> (for <hi>Iohn Stubs</hi> his was but <hi>a</hi> Repetition of
<hi>William Edmundsons</hi> his <hi>Sermon</hi>) that they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
all the Glory of Honours and Pleasures of
this World for this <hi>Light:</hi> and they had left their
<hi>Wives</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> and exposed themselves to hard
Travels and to many Hardships and Sufferings for
the <hi>Light</hi> sake: I heard him also patiently and
gave him no <hi>Interruption</hi> (as he twice openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
that I had not interrupted them: but when he
had finished his <hi>Sermon</hi> and I had gained a little
calm and liberty of Speech, immediately before I
could finish one Sentence; that <hi>Pragmatical and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting

me,<note place="margin">The <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and rash interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</note>
so that I openly complained of incivility and
inhumanity: that hearing patiently their two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
they were set down, and common Reason
said that it was my turn to speak, and every body
desired what Answer I could frame to hear it, that
then I should be <hi>disturbed</hi> and <hi>stopt</hi> was no way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting
the Societies of Civil and Morral men: I
then Answered,<note place="margin">A short Answer to 2 Sermons</note> that those very <hi>Sermons</hi> or <hi>Orations</hi>
which they had now made to the People were so
far beneath the merit of an Answer to them, that
they ministred and afforded to me a mighty and
invincible <hi>Argument,</hi> that the Spirit of God [64] was
not the <hi>Author of them:</hi> For we all knew that the
<hi>Spirit of God</hi> was most purely <hi>Rational,</hi> and a <hi>Spirit</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:43125:56"/>
of pure <hi>Order,</hi> and did not prompt or move men
to break <hi>Hedges</hi> and leap over one <hi>Ordinance</hi> into
another: We were engaged in a mutual <hi>Conference</hi>
and <hi>Disputation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gods spirit not those of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</note> we were in the midst of it, how
came we then to fall into <hi>Popular Orations</hi> and

to fall upon our knees and Answer an <hi>Argument</hi>
with a <hi>Prayer</hi> (as it is a frequent practice with the
<hi>Quakers,</hi>) is it proper to break off <hi>Prayer</hi> and fall
to disputing, or out of Disputation into <hi>Preaching?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I said my Opposites Spirit was far from the
<hi>Holy Spirit of God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Motions</hi> with which my <hi>Antagonists</hi> were acted,
for they had neither power to keep civil Order,
nor to be patient, for not being able to answer nor
bear my words <hi>W. Edmundson</hi> said expresly what
should we sit here and suffer him to vent his <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies
and Lies?</hi> he hath kept us here two dayes,
and have proved nothing, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I took a little boldness and told them, that if
<hi>Paul</hi> himself were present, or <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> himself
in their bodily presence which they confessed he
<hi>died</hi> in at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> yet they would say unto them,
even unto Christ himself, thou hast falsely <hi>charged</hi>
but thou hast proved nothing: <hi>Paul</hi> himself should
be an Enemy, and Jesus Christ should be a <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer</hi>
and a <hi>Beelzebub</hi> because he brought glad
news of the Truth from Heaven to them.</p>
            <p>I further said, that I had more to offer in the
name and in the cause of the true Lord Jesus
Christ, and after I had got liberty of speech, I said
that as they which <hi>denied</hi> the person of the true
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43125:56"/>
Lord Jesus denied the true <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> himself,<note place="margin">The Offices of Christ Iesus</note> so
they which denied the Offices which God the

            </p>
            <p>They <hi>demanded</hi> of me wherein <hi>they denied the
offices of Christ Iesus:</hi> I Answered, <hi>I had many
things to declare in which they denied the</hi> Offices
<hi>of Christ Iesus</hi> (as well as the <hi>Papists</hi> for which we
seperated from them as <hi>Antichristans,</hi> not holding
the Head the true Lord Jesus the <hi>Sacrifice and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,</hi>
the only <hi>Prophet, Apostle</hi> and <hi>Messenger,</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>the last times, the last Dispensation and Will of
his Father:</hi> contrary to the <hi>Papists</hi> who set up
(some of them) <hi>the Pope</hi> and (some of them) <hi>the
general counsel above the</hi> Lord Jesus declaring his
mind in the <hi>Holy Scriptures:</hi> and con- [65] trary
to the <hi>Quakers</hi> who set up a voice or motion within
them over topping and over pouring the voice of
Christ Jesus in the Scriptures, some of them main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
that this <hi>Light</hi> within them is that <hi>great
Prophet</hi> that was to come which <hi>Moses</hi> Prophesied
of, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>I said I would contract my thoughts,<note place="margin">The King<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly office of the Lord Iesus.</note> and speak at
present only a little of his <hi>Kingly power and Office,</hi>
and I plainly denounced that they were all notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
guilty of <hi>High Treason</hi> against the King of
Kings, the Lord Jesus, yea as far as in them lay,
they robd him of his Crown, and Life and All.</p>
            <p>In particular I told them I had abundant proof
there ready to bring forth from <hi>G. Foxes</hi> Book, that
he and his Associates denied (yea all of them) that
visible Kingdome and <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Institutions</hi> which
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43125:57"/>
he as <hi>King</hi> over all his <hi>Subjects</hi> hath <hi>Sovereign Right</hi>
unto, and most faithfully and wisely ordained to
continue until his coming again.</p>
            <p>I told them that <hi>G. Fox</hi> his Book and all their
Books and Professions denied any visible Church
of Christ at all:<note place="margin">The visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Church &amp; Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</note> and though they maintained and
kept up <hi>Congregations</hi> (of pretended Christan) <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships</hi>
and <hi>Worshippers</hi> (in a direct contradiction unto
their own Tenents, yet) they maintained the
Church was in God and so not visible: the Officers
of the Church were invisible and immediately
made by the immediate and invisible Spirit. The
<hi>Baptisme</hi> was within, and only the <hi>Baptisme</hi> of the
<hi>Spirit</hi> and of <hi>Fire:</hi> The <hi>Lords Supper</hi> appointed
by the Lord Jesus to be a Spiritual Feast remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
him until his coming was with them nothing
else but Spiritual joy, which they have one in and
with another, which they have by the second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Lord Jesus to them, who they said was
come again to the Apostles the second time, and
unto themselves also.</p>
            <p>Upon this (as I remember) there fell out some
words between my Opposites, and some of the
people called <hi>Baptists:</hi> But some of them (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>Iohn Stubs</hi>) demanded of me, why I thus
charged them and was my self so guilty, not liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>Church Ordinances</hi> my self.</p>
            <p>I Answered,<note place="margin">Touching the several Churches extant.</note> that it was one thing to be in Arms
against the <hi>King of Kings</hi> and his <hi>visible Kingdome</hi>

            <p>After all my search and examinations and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
I said,<note place="margin">Churches nearest to Christ Iesus</note> I do profess to believe, that some
come nearer to the <hi>first primitive Churches,</hi> and the
<hi>Institutions</hi> and <hi>Appointments</hi> of Christ Jesus then
others, as in many respects so in that gallant and
heavenly and fundamental Principle of the true
matter of a Christian Congregation, Flock or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,<note place="margin">This was and I hope is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the N English Church.</note>

Living Stones,</hi> such as can give some account
how the <hi>Grace of God</hi> hath appeared unto them,

that if my Soul could finde rest in joyning
unto any of the <hi>Churches</hi> professing Christ Jesus
now extant, I would readily and gladly do it, yea
unto themselves whom I now opposed.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Not finding rest, they themselves
knew, there is a <hi>Time</hi> of purity and <hi>Primitive Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of Christ Iesus</note>

thou makest thy Flock to rest at noon; for why should I

               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:43125:58"/>
I doe not remember that any <hi>Reply</hi> was made

            </p>
            <p>I now praied there<note n="1" place="bottom">"<hi>their.</hi>"R. W. Ms. Ann.</note> patience to hear me a few
words: I said we had spent two whole dayes from

               <note place="margin">My offer in the end of the second dayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</note> I told

for <hi>Newport:</hi> or if they were not willing to
that, I would (if God permitted) attend them there
on the second day called <hi>Munday,</hi> in the Morning to
proceed upon the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. Edmundson</hi> said, they had spent so much time
already upon but two of them:<note place="margin">Lying pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to Gods service</note> and both he and

they must go about the work of the Lord to which
he had called them.</p>
            <p>I told them I had used all diligence, I failed not
to meet them about the exact hour appointed, and
alwayes before the audience was come. I never

Utterance and Audience; I rather chose thus to
Apologize for my self, then down right to blame
them, on whom (they saw well enough) I laid the
blame of our long proceeding. I told them I had
spoken nothing to them but the <hi>Eternal truth</hi> of
God, which sooner or later would arrest them,
and using aloud the words of the Lord Jesus <hi>[viz.
The words that I have spoken shall judge you at the last
day.]</hi> I withdrew.</p>
            <p>Within a quarter of an hour they sent one to
me to desire my coming in again to them, and
<hi>William Edmondson</hi> (commonly their proud mouth)
told me that I had deeply charged them and laid
many <hi>false Accusations</hi> upon them, and some of
them dangerous, both as they were <hi>Christians,</hi> and
as they were men: they had used long patience in
hearing of me, and yet because it should be seen
that they were willing to hear the utmost that I
had to say they would meet and spend a few hours
with me on the second Day following at <hi>nine in the
Morning,</hi> only they would not endure any long and
tedious Discourses.</p>
            <p>I answered that their own souls knew,<note place="margin">A mutual agreement for a third dayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</note> and the
<hi>Auditors</hi> knew I used to be brief: and if they had
pleased to have given me leave, I would have fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ished
the whole seven by noon the first day: and I
would now promise them (by Gods help) to finish
what I had to say to the other five remaining in a
quarter of an hour, so that in five quarters of an
hour I would present them with what I had to say:
<hi>W. Edmundson</hi> said they would expect I should so do,
and all of them seemed well pleased that I offered
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43125:59"/>
to dispatch each Position in a quarter of an hour;
I said they must not count me false &amp; a <hi>Promise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaker</hi>
if I was not exact to a quarter of an hour
possible I might be within a quarter, possible I
might something exceed it, but I hoped not to

afterward at <hi>Providence</hi> he unjustly more then
once upbraided me saying,<note place="margin">A quarter of an hour much can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vased.</note> 
               <hi>Is this your quarter of an
hour?</hi> I answered that Christians nor any prudent
man would be so curious and critical as to raise
Censures and Accusations upon the nicityes and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintyes
of a few <hi>Minutes,</hi> for unless we had
Clocks and Watches and quarter-Glasses (as in some
Ships) it was impossible to be exactly punctual:
however by Gods help I said I would study such
<hi>Exactness,</hi> that I would rather omit much I had to
say then fail in my promise to them.</p>
            <p>After this (as I heard) <hi>W Hitchcock</hi> of <hi>Newport</hi>
held dispute with them about Water-Baptisme, I
was withdrawn being evening and weary.</p>
            <p>I was told by many of <hi>Providence,</hi> that I knew
them they would not stand a <hi>Disputation:</hi> or if
they did they would not continue without great
<hi>Advantages</hi> and be as slippery as <hi>Eeles,</hi> and break
off abruptly, as their spirit hurried them, I therefore
studiously endeavoured to tole and drive them to
the finishing of my remaining five at <hi>Newport,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers spirit &amp; policy</note> and
the other seven at <hi>Providence.</hi> And thus by the
most wise and gracious hand of God we came to
the end of the second dayes work, and the second
Position and the end of the Week.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:43125:59"/>
It was queried by some why (at <hi>Newport</hi> and
<hi>Providence</hi> afterward) they appointed the end of
the weeks for the <hi>Disputation?</hi> and why since it
was not finished they would not proceed on the
first day? It is not immaginable that they cordially
owne that day,<note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers would not dispute on the first day and why.</note> (for the <hi>Quakers</hi> work upon it) but
they wisely resolved to have the whole first day
with the People to make up their <hi>Breaches,</hi> stop
<hi>Leakes</hi> dress wounds that might be in the foregoing
<hi>Agitations</hi> against their <hi>Consciences &amp; Credits.</hi> It
is dolefull that men of excellent parts, and of great
knowledge in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> should yet so ly under
a Sentence of <hi>Gospel justice,</hi> that they cannot but
<hi>deceive</hi> as they are <hi>deceived,</hi> that they cannot but <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
Lyes</hi> and <hi>tell Lyes,</hi> horrible and blasphemous
Lyes, as confidently as the <hi>Purest Truths,</hi> and suck
in and, powre out the poyson of Dragons, the great
<hi>red Dragon,</hi> the <hi>Father of Lyes,</hi> instead of the sweet
<hi>Milk</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> from the <hi>Breasts</hi> of the <hi>Way, the
Truth, and the Life,</hi> the son of <hi>God Christ Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>69] THe third day of our <hi>Conference</hi> being come,<note place="margin">The third dayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference at New-port</note>
being the second of the Week as was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
<hi>W. Edmundson</hi> began and said to this effect,
<hi>Roger,</hi> we have waited upon thee two dayes already
to hear what thou hadst to say to prove thy false
<hi>Charges</hi> against us: we are here according to prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ise
to spend some hours about the rest of the seven
which yet remain: we must tel thee that we will
not give thee leave to make a long work of it: if
according to thy promise thou wilt dispatch each
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43125:60"/>
af the other five in a quarter of an hour, we will
keep our promise and hear thee.</p>
            <p>I knew it was in vain, (as in the other two dayes
past I found it) to insist upon their obstinately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<hi>Advantage</hi> of three constantly engaged against
me (beside their accidental speakers who had lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty
when others were forbidden) I say notable and
<hi>Chief men</hi> in their way and <hi>Sect:</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Letter sent in to all of us.</note> and having just
then read a Letter as I sate there directed to my
self and all of us to be read in the <hi>Assembly,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
with presenting the Letter to them, and told
them that just now it was delivered to me <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I
knew not certainly from whome it came, nor of
one Tittle of the Contents of it: only I judged it
to be my Brother <hi>Robert Williams (School-Master</hi>
of <hi>Newport</hi>) his hand: I read the <hi>Superscription</hi>
and offered if they pleased to unseal and read it,
or I would deliver it into their hand so to doe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. Edmundson</hi> answered that they came not
thither to hear <hi>Papers,</hi> but to hear how I would
make out my false <hi>Charges</hi> against them and this
he speaking none would whist against it, and this
he did speak because my Brother beyond my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
and thoughts spake some words the first
morning against their <hi>Insulting</hi> and <hi>domineering</hi>
over me, as also delivered a paper to them which
was with much adoe handed and delivered to them
but never read, containing these two great <hi>Points</hi>
in every true penitent Converts eye, <hi>viz.</hi> the sight
of <hi>Sin as Sin.</hi> And 2. The sight of the material
<hi>Lord Iesus</hi> as the true <hi>Messiah</hi> or anointed, these
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43125:60"/>
were the two <hi>Daggers</hi> which they knew stab'd at
the heart of their feigned <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> within
them.</p>
            <p>I knew my Brother patiently waited there the
two first dayes,<note place="margin">The Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter refused to be opened by the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</note> and was (with others) silenced: and
now I guessed he had sent them his mind and
would trouble them no more. I told them [70] the
whole <hi>Assembly</hi> had Interest in the Letter, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to us to read to the rest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>W. Edmundson</hi> and the rest desired the <hi>Auditors</hi>
to speak if they desired to have it read: some of
the <hi>Quakers</hi> said it might be read when the business
was over: so I to make no breach put it up, and
in the end of the day offered it again, claiming
their <hi>Promise,</hi> but they regarded it not, so that
after the <hi>Conference</hi> ended (we of <hi>Providence</hi> being
called away by a Boat preparing to depart) I stept
to my Brothers house and acquainted him with
Passages, who said that not only the <hi>Superscription</hi>
was his hand but the Letter also, and I might open
and read it, and (if it might be) present it to the
intended <hi>Assembly</hi> at <hi>Providence:</hi> of which we shall
hear when it pleaseth the mercifull hand of the
Lord to bring us to those Transactions.<note place="margin">The Sum of the Letter</note> In short,
it was refused there also, &amp; therefore I have judged
it fit, since it was so solemnly flung out both at
<hi>Providence</hi> and <hi>Newport</hi> that it should have as sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn
a <hi>Publication</hi> to the whole world,<note place="margin">My self reproved in the Letter in 3 par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars</note> and the
rather because it is a <hi>witness</hi> of Truth as to the
two first dayes transactions, impartially reproving
my <hi>Opposites</hi> and me also where he conceived we
were failing: It is true I am not of my Brothers
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43125:61"/>
               <hi>Conscience</hi> as to the <hi>Discipline</hi> of Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> that I
ought to have admonished the <hi>Quakers</hi> in private,
before I had so publickly <hi>&amp;c.</hi> since they proclaimed
their sin like <hi>Sodom</hi> on the house top: and it is
preposterous to run from <hi>House-top-sins</hi> to closet
<hi>Concealments</hi> and <hi>Admonitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Nor can I own the <hi>Quakers</hi> in their wayes
and worships to be Servants of the Lord (as my
Brother calls them) any more then the greedy
<hi>Wolves,</hi> devouring the souls of the <hi>Ephesians, Act.</hi>

but that some <hi>Lambs</hi> and <hi>Chickens</hi> of <hi>Christ Iesus</hi>
are carried away in their (Soul bloody) jaws also,
whom I beseech to remember themselves, and I
humbly beseech the God and Father of mercies
to pull them out, and help all that love his Name,
to help pull them out as <hi>Brands</hi> from the <hi>Eternal
Burnings.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sharpness sometimes a duty.</note> As for the <hi>Wolves</hi> and <hi>Foxes</hi> the <hi>Blind
Leaders,</hi> the <hi>Chapmen</hi> that by feigned words make

                  <p>LOving Friends, though the Lord in his Wisdome
hath denied me from <hi>Nature</hi> the gift of utterance,
yet in his infinite mercy he hath vouchsafed to me his
free gift as to <hi>writing,</hi> whereby the private motions
arising between God and my own Soul (without

out of a sensible sadness, which is upon my Spirit
in beholding the <hi>Cloudings</hi> and <hi>Vailings</hi> of the most

But <hi>(Loving Friends</hi>) herein mistake me not at first:
This is no charge nor discharge, but an appearance
unto my Soul, even unto the moving of my Bowels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

I write not to charge nor admonish, neither for <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending

                  <p>72] Therefore I am humkly bold to speak, unto all the
contending Disputants in the plainness of my heart.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>First</hi> unto the <hi>Complaining Disputant</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
unto my Soul, that you have not dealt as a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Servant of the Lord Iesus, with your fellow Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
for you should have admonished them both first

heard you then to have told it to the Church, the great
<hi>Congregation</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p>2. It doth appear unto my Soul, that you have
assumed and presumed too much, being so large and
high proposals, which do appear unto me not as charges,
but in this first Appearance as Proposals, until they
are maintained as charges by sufficient proof, wherein
they may be molified: But in truth herein I am at a

be so (which in charity I have reason to hope other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise)
your Conscience will be more cleared in your Lord

in your Lord and Masters service, for both <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants</hi>

Lord and Master, and you must do that service which
is ordained by your <hi>Lord and Master</hi> to do in your seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
stations (either in truth or falshood) there is no hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

you shall as the Grasse wither, and as the Flower

                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That you have not done your Master faithful
service by assuming and presuming beyond the bounds of
<hi>Moderation</hi> and <hi>Christianity:</hi> but as I said before
take not these as charges, but as proceeding from your
own <hi>Expressions</hi> and <hi>Behaviours</hi> in your late actings
which have not been for that solid edification of the
<hi>Auditors</hi> which was expected but for defending and
advancing of self, which appeared:</p>
                  <p>1. By your limiting the Holy one of <hi>Israel,</hi> contrary
unto your <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Masters</hi> Commission.</p>

                  <p>73] 3. You have not dealt faithfully and Christian
like with your elder fellow servant, and then what
would you do with the Heir.</p>
                  <p>To the first appearance you would not begin before
you had stated by forced Covenant that none should
speak (though with leave in modesty and sobriety) but
those that would joyn issue with the complainant, and

that under hand writing.<note place="margin">True lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rety in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed</note> And herein (loving friends)

which you do enjoy, and cannot enjoy else where: And
will you now shut up your common Wine-presses that we
can have no fruit nor refreshing but what comes from

not only upon our Souls but upon our <hi>Temporal
Liberties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For in our Courts of Iudicature there is a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
liberty stated for any to speak freely for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
sake in any Cause in the Bounds of Sobriety
and Modesty. But this appears against the Rules and
Practises of all <hi>Christianity,</hi> not practised by the
<hi>Judicial Convocation,</hi> nor by the high <hi>Commission
Court</hi> in our Native Couutry, where often I have been,
and the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> with the rest of the <hi>Bishops</hi> in
Gravity and Christianity (though their pleadings were
by Proctors, yet) gave liberty especially for Relations
to speak: As in one Instance of a person whom you
all have heard of, when he was to come upon Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
his wife being big with Childe came with him,
the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> (though otherwise he might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper,
yet herein shewd great civility by considering
the Womans condition, and gave liberty for speaking to
the full, with replying no discomfortable Words, yea in
Christianity delayed further prosecution until she was
delivered, though afterwards they acted their improper
persecution.</p>
                  <p>But into what a condition shall we be brought (I
hope not into an high <hi>Commission</hi> nor <hi>Inquisition
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43125:63"/>
Court</hi>) if this <hi>Imprimator</hi> goes on, that none shall
speak, no not so much as suffered to desire to speak,
though they are great with Childe with the Man
Christ Iesus: But I hope the People will see their
Liberties, and your selves know this was not the true
Apostles practises.</p>
                  <p>2. Your sad quenching of the Spirit when the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it arose in any for Soul-satisfaction in any to
speak,<note place="margin">Quenching of the Spirit</note> you would not suffer them to be expressed but
stifle them in their coming forth: O dear Friends con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,

confounding of his memory, or stopping of his utterance,

under the pretence of challenging all comers (when

who shall judge? ye will not suffer the Gospel rule,
that the standers by, the Spirits of the Prophets shall

of <hi>China,</hi> judge all the World to have no eyes but
themselves excepting the Men of <hi>Europe</hi> to whom
they will grant one eye, and that is more then our
proud <hi>Pharisees</hi> will do to any that bow not down
to their most grosse <hi>Phylacteries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But from this finger of God this providential
Letter appearing upon the Wall before us: I return
to the work of the day, which was the Discussion
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43125:65"/>
and Probation (on my part) of the other five Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals
remaining.</p>
            <p>I therefore (after the Letter was put up unread
into my pocket) requested their Patience,<note place="margin">The third Position against the Quakers spirit Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed</note> while I
produced my Proof of the third Position, which
was, <hi>viz. [That the Spirit by which they were acted
was not the true Spirit of God:]</hi> Tis true I had
many things in my mind and memory) some of
them I here express) but I was forced to pick and
chufe and lay by: for I told them that according
to my promise, and their expectation I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
them with the Substance of my proof of this
Position in the compass of about a quarter of an
hour.</p>
            <p>76] I reminded them first of the nature of the
Word Spirit in Latine <hi>Spiritus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The word spirit</note> in Greek <hi>Pneuma,</hi>
in the Hebrew <hi>Ruch</hi> and <hi>Ruach,</hi> signifying some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>Breath,</hi> sometimes <hi>Wind,</hi> and from thence
applied unto God himself, unto Angels, unto Men,
as denoting a spiritual, powerful, invisible fine Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
distinct from flesh and earthly Bodies:
Hence God was said to be a Spirit, not properly
but that his Being was pure, powerful, invisible, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1, Whether God was properly a Spirit (as the
Quaker affirmed) we had some controversie at
<hi>Providence</hi> of which hereafter.)</p>
            <p>2. Concerning Spirits, I observed two great
Sects: 1 Those of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> (who were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the most Orthodox, Sound and right, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such a Spiritual Substance in Angels and Spirits
and a Resurrection. 2. The Sadduces which held
neither Angel, nor Spirit, nor Resurrection, as at this
day, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:43125:65"/>
3. It is clear there is a two-fold Spirit: 1. Holy
and pure:<note place="margin">The quality of Spirits</note> such a Spirit is God himself, and the
Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father by the
Son, such are the Spirits of the Angels, the Spirits
of Gods Children in part, and the Spirits of just
men made perfect (the <hi>Quakers</hi> say here, we say in
the life coming.)</p>
            <p>The other Spirit is a wicked Spirit, a lying and
a murtherous Spirit in Sathan and his Children, yet
often counterfeiting the Holy and pure Spirit, like
the Oile and Ointment which God prescribed and
forbad the like of it to be made on pain of death.
Therefore we are commanded not to believe every
Spirit, but to try even the very Spirits, not only of
men but of <hi>Doctrines, Churches, Religions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">All spirits must be tried</note> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Name of God, (as do the <hi>Turks, Iews</hi> and
<hi>Christians</hi>) and of the Son of God, as do all the
Antichrists and Antichristians extant.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>The Holy Spirit of God (being the</hi> seven
Lambs of Fire, the seven Eyes, and seven Horns, <hi>Rev.
5.</hi>) he is pleased to work variously.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> in an ordinary way of Regeneration and
Sanctification, &amp;c. common to all the lowest and
youngest of Gods Children, <hi>(Iohn 3. that which is
born of the Spirit is Spirit</hi>) Hence we read of the
Spirit of Prayer, and of Holiness wrought in the
Soul by the finger or power of God: so that the
knowledge of God, the fear, the love, the trusting
to and in God, the calling upon God is natural to
all Gods Children, <hi>Gal. 5. Abba Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>77] The second is extraordinary and immediate,
such as was pour'd upon the Lord Jesus, <hi>Isai.</hi> 11.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43125:66"/>
such as Christ breathed upon the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and by
the <hi>Apostles</hi> hands upon others when they spake
with <hi>Tongues,</hi> fortelling things to come, and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Holy Scriptures or Records, as did the
Prophets of old, and the first Messengers the Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
of Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>I told them I had many things to say as to the
false Spirits of the false Christs, and false Prophets,
the Spirits of Devils as well as the Spirits of God
(in the <hi>Revelation</hi>) and the three wayes of deceit
mentioned, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. by Spirit, by Word, or by
Letter: but I would contract my self, I say that their
Spirit by which they were acted was not Gods
Spirit.</p>
            <p>1. Because the Holy Spirit of God was given by
means,<note place="margin">Gods Spirit given by Gods means</note> but the <hi>Quakers</hi> pretended all along in
<hi>G. Fox</hi> and other Books, that their Spirit was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
or without means: I said in the <hi>8th</hi> of the
<hi>Romans</hi> was a <hi>Golden Chain</hi> of <hi>Gods Order</hi> or <hi>Method</hi>
of <hi>Working</hi> from <hi>Predestination</hi> to <hi>Glorification:</hi> In
the <hi>10th.</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> was a <hi>Golden Chain</hi> of the
<hi>Means appointed,</hi> &amp;c. How shall a Man be saved?
by calling upon God?<note place="margin">The Spirit of God working by means</note> How shall he call on him
except he believe in him? how shall a Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in him except he hear of him? how shall
a Man hear of him except some Preach? how shall
a Man Preach except he be sent, &amp;c, Hence <hi>Peter</hi>
Preaching Christ Jesus to the first Converts, they
were some thousands brought to Christ, when they
were pierced to the heart, and cried out <hi>what shall
we do? Peter</hi> sends them nor to a light within
them, but bids them <hi>Repent and be Baptized,</hi> Act.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43125:66"/>
14. <hi>Paul</hi> so spake that many believed,<note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers at <hi>Newport</hi> appealed too pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly</note> 
               <hi>Act.</hi> 16.
while <hi>Paul</hi> spake the Lord opened <hi>Lydias</hi> heart:
and I appealed to the Consciences of those called
<hi>Quakers</hi> at <hi>Newport</hi> there present, whether in a
contradiction this Spirit they now professed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
immediately upon them from God (as they
spake) or was not conveyed unto them by the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istry
of the former Preaching <hi>Quakers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that came
unto them: so that these now are but the waterers
and confirmers of this Doctrine of the Spirit in
them.</p>
            <p>2. As Believing and Conversion comes by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
&amp;c. so these extraordinary gifts and powrings
forth of Gods Spirits was generally by means also:
Christ used Breathing upon the <hi>Apostles:</hi> the Spirit
of God descended, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 19. in the laying on of
hands: in <hi>Peters</hi> Preaching, <hi>Acts.</hi> 10. the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Spirit of [78] <hi>Tongues</hi> and <hi>Prophecy</hi> descended
upon <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company, and not before,
yea, and what is that waiting in silence used in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
and in the publick Assemblies of the <hi>Quakers,</hi>
but a confessed means in which they wait for the
Spirit of God (as poor Souls they think) descending
on them.</p>
            <p>I was then forced to omit the <hi>Allegations</hi> out of
<hi>G. Fox</hi> his book then by me and ready, but I will
now recite a few of them.</p>
            <p>In page 6. of this Book in Folio, <hi>G. Fox</hi> brings
in <hi>Samuel Eaton</hi>
               <note place="margin">Samuel Eaton</note> saying <hi>[The Prophets and Apostles
drew people to an outward Word]</hi> He Answers, Now

and did not they bring them to Christ the power
of God, which is the end of words which is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate.</p>
            <p>Again in the same Page <hi>Samuel Eaton [Is not the

            <p>In the same Page <hi>Samuel Eaton [Are not they se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced

[The Spirit and Faith is not conveyed to any Man

            <p>I Reply, and observe how the wisdome of Men
is enmity against God, and how witty this <hi>Fox</hi> is
to catch himself and others in the Traps of eternal

<hi>Apostle</hi> was [79] manifest to every ones Conscience
in the sight of God, and that was of God which
the Children disobeyed.</p>
            <p>I Reply, 1. (As in his late Book exalting his

and prophanely joyns the <hi>Philistian Priests,</hi> and
<hi>Egyptian Conjurers</hi> with <hi>Holy Iob</hi> and his Friends,

all Mankinde with the Grace and Spirit of God
both ordinary and extraordinary as may be seen at
the first view.</p>
            <p>2. His Scope is (abominably and horribly,) to
make the holy Spirit of God capable of being

               <note place="margin">Tho. Moor.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> As if all that receive <hi>G. Fox</hi> his Book

more to this Head afterward.</p>
            <p>At present I return to my <hi>Antagonists,</hi> who (while

not hold until my quarter of an hour, and this Head

            <p>I then answered that there was a leading of a

               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:43125:70"/>

said what impiety is it, what cruelty and inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

all things as God, not to reveal unto Men, and
especially in their publick Assemblies so many
deep points of the Godhead, of Creation of the
Holy Three in Heaven and Earth, (which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess)
and all the deep Mysteries and Prophecies in

their <hi>Revelations,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Most Holy, Omniscient,</hi>

are but <hi>Childrens</hi> and <hi>Frantick Persons Dreams</hi> and

is the same with their doing all things through
Christ which strengtheneth them that is not all
things litterally,<note place="margin">Knowing and doing all things</note> (for that were ridiculous and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
to affirm it) but all things <hi>figuratively</hi> and

to require them to know and do in order to his
<hi>Glory</hi> and their <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Iohn Stubs</hi> insisted how they knew the <hi>Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
number</hi> of 1260 dayes, the 42 Months, the <hi>Time

this Word within, whether they meant in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
(the eye of the Soul) or in the Will, or
in the Memory, or in the Affections, or in all of
these joyntly: for Light is only seen with the Eye,

(which stinks up to Heaven and cries for vengeance)
in the stripping stark naked of their Women, and
discovering of themselves in the Assembly of Men

should be their Glory and the Glory of God, their

            <p>4. I did also mention a fourth Reason against
their Spirit,<note place="margin">The true Spirit wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be examined by the Scripture and every mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sceence.</note> and had prosecuted it but I knew that
(by reason of my Adversaries interposure) I had
exceeded my quarter of an hour: It was taken
from the Holy Spirit of God subjecting it self to
be tried, commanding all men to search the Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ords,
commending the <hi>Bereans</hi> for examining <hi>Pauls

this is the true meaning of the Spirit of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
are subject to the Prophets, not that a true
<hi>Prophet</hi> or <hi>Messenger</hi> of God can subject the truth
of God (which he believes so to be and will rather
suffer many deaths then relinquish) to be sentenced
by all the <hi>Prophets</hi> in the Church to be false, and
he acquiess or rest in, [87] or subject his <hi>Spirit</hi> and
<hi>Conscience</hi> to that Sentence: but that the true <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
of God</hi> are willing to have their <hi>Teachings</hi>

            </p>
            <p>On the contrary, I would have shewed (which
indeed all men know) that the thief endured not

searching the <hi>galld Horse</hi> endures not rubbing, the

dark <hi>Lanthorns,</hi> and under the covert of the night:
who may not see this in <hi>G. Fox.</hi> all along his Book,
running into the Thickets and Burroughs of Words

general,<note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers cry is Light but they dare not come

which hath been the trade of the false and

that short time be finished wherein the Lord

into the Lake that burns with fire and brimstone.</p>
            <p>How oft have I been visited by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Repent, Repent, hearken to the Light within thee,</hi>
&amp;c. And I never could perswade them to sit down

but when their <hi>Cuckoes note</hi> and <hi>song</hi> was over,<note place="margin">The two pretended Witnesses Reeve and Muggle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> and
their <hi>Fools Bolt shot,</hi> then fell they to <hi>Cursing and

and so be gone no less then <hi>Reve and Muggleton</hi>
(pretending to be Gods two last Prophets and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses)

            <p>But to return, while I was beginning to urge the
tryal of the <hi>Spirits, W. Edmundson</hi> said the <hi>Spirit of
God</hi> was above the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and not to be tryed by
them: for it gave out the <hi>Scriptures &amp;c.</hi> And I said
and say it is easie to boast of the <hi>Spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers would set the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Scripture at odds.</note> but the <hi>true
Spirit</hi> (in a Sense) and the holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> are one,
as the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> are one, and therefore can
not but be willing to be examined by the holy
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43125:74"/>
               <hi>Records,</hi> as every man or author will stand to his
own scripture, work or writing; for the Writers
were but <hi>Pens of Heaven writing,</hi> and used by the
hand of the holy <hi>Spirit.</hi> And I remember that I
said to <hi>W. Edmundson,</hi> Friend, You yesterday in
your long Sermon alleadged that <hi>holy Scripture</hi> viz,
<hi>Men will not come to the light, least they should be
reproved,</hi> [88] because their deeds are evil: This is
the true cause of your quarrel against the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
and of exalting the Spirit above them that is upon
a true ballance, your own Spirit, yea the Spirit of
Sathan to be God, and Christ, and Spirit and all.</p>
            <p>After some few interchanges and altercations,<note place="margin">The 4th Position concerning the Scriptures.</note> we
descended to the fourth <hi>Position,</hi> which they read
out of the Paper (as they did all the rest) which
was this, viz. <hi>That the People called Quakers did not
own the Holy Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In one Copy it was written</hi> Really <hi>own,</hi> viz. They
did not really own <hi>the</hi> Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I said there was a twofold owning the</hi> Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<hi>or the Writings of God as there is a twofold
owning the</hi> Scriptures <hi>or</hi> Writings of men,<note place="margin">A twofold owning of any scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Writing.</note> 
               <hi>the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
<hi>and</hi> Declarations of Kings and Princes:
<hi>The one is verbal and literal,</hi> viz. that such a writing
or Declaration, or Treatise is extant, and that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the Kings Authority and Command.</p>
            <p>The second is real and actual, when the Authority
of it is in all humble obedience submitted to and
obeyed: when the Justice and Equity, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
and goodness, as well as the royal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is embraced and magnified.</p>
            <p>I said the <hi>Iews</hi> owned verbally and wonderfully
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:43125:75"/>
that Writings of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> and the <hi>Papists</hi>
owned both old and new but it is known that in
many particulars they do in effect deny and damn
them. 1. They both set up their rotten <hi>Traditions,</hi>
their unwritten <hi>Verityes</hi> (as they speak) of equal
authority with, if not (in cases) above the <hi>holy
Scripture.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Iews and Papists and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers all of them in effect deny the holy Scriptures.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. They set up the Papists by the authority of
the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> a most defective <hi>Translation,</hi>
notoriously false in many places all over above the
first Copyes of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> whence all
<hi>Translations</hi> as <hi>Counterpanes</hi> and secondary Copyes
or <hi>Duplicates</hi> ought to flow.</p>
            <p>3. The Papists set up the <hi>Pope</hi> as the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Judg &amp; Interpreter in all <hi>Questions</hi> about the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> and the Jews make their <hi>Rabbies</hi> as so
many <hi>Popes</hi> also.</p>
            <p>4. Their <hi>Interpretations</hi> are so forraign and
strange and many of them so absurd &amp; mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
from the genuine &amp; proper Sence of the
Scriptures, and adulterated with <hi>Wresting and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorizings
&amp;c.</hi> that is truly said of them that they
bring not their <hi>Doctrines, Disciplines</hi> and <hi>Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
to the <hi>Scriptures</hi> but force the [89] holy <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
of God to attend and wait upon their Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
as a Negro Slave and Lacquey.</p>
            <p>I said the Jews and Papists did not more disowne
the holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> upon the account of their <hi>Popes
and Traditions</hi> and Interpretations than the Quakers
did upon the account of their <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> and
<hi>Interpretations</hi> also.<note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the holy Scriptures in many horrible Partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</note> Who knows not that in the
beginning of their Profession, they generally fell

from the reading of them by themselves or in their
<hi>Families,</hi> or in their <hi>Publick Assemblyes,</hi> only crying
up the <hi>Light within, the Spirit within, the Scriptures
within, their Teacher within.</hi> They stil say <hi>The
Scripture was not the Word of God, the Scripture is
but a dead Letter,</hi> they have no need of <hi>Paper-Teachers</hi>
having the spirit that gave it forth? Yea
as the Papists say, if the Scriptures were lost and
burnt out of the world, the <hi>spirit</hi> within them
could give new <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tis true the <hi>Quakers</hi> in this Dispute professed to
be tryed by the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Show of Quakers respecting the Scriptures.</note> which the first <hi>Quakers</hi>
among us wholly denied, but only by the Spirit

not but a subtle trick of <hi>Equivocation,</hi> when stil

between <hi>God, Christ, and Spirit</hi> and <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;</hi>
what should hinder but that the Scripture
is but a <hi>dead Letter,</hi> and (compared with their spirit)
a weak and needless <hi>Paper</hi> unto them that hath
such a <hi>light</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> within to guide them?</p>
            <p>I told them before and now that there was an
<hi>Irish Papist</hi> in the late warrs that spoke the very
heart and soul of <hi>Iews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An Irish Papist con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the Truth.</note> 
               <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi>
and the <hi>Quakers</hi> themselves, as to the holy
Scriptures. In plundering and rifling a <hi>Protestants</hi>
house he found a Bible and flung it in the Kennel,
and kickt and trod upon it saying, <hi>The plague of God
take this Book, it is the cause of all these Quarrels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Opposite said they owned the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43125:76"/>
their place as a <hi>Declaration</hi> of the Saints Conditions,
&amp; <hi>Iohn Burnet</hi> took a <hi>Bible</hi> and read publickly that
Passage in <hi>Luke</hi> 1. where <hi>Luke</hi> calls his Writing a
<hi>Declaration.</hi> I urged that this will of God. (for
this <hi>Declaration</hi> of what Christ said and did, and of
all the rest of the Scripture, was a <hi>Declaration and
Revelation</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> Will to his People and to the
whole World) this written and revealed [90] will
of God I said was the Judge and Decider of all
Questions, the tryer of all <hi>Spirits,</hi> all <hi>Religions,</hi> all
<hi>Churches,</hi> all <hi>Doctrines,</hi> all <hi>Opinions,</hi> all <hi>Actions.</hi>
They answered they did owne the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and
would be tryed by the <hi>Scriptures</hi> (which is a new
trick, meaning according to their own not to be
questioned <hi>Interpretations</hi>) I urged that they set up
their Spirit above the Scriptures, (fathering all their
Revilings Cursings and Abominations upon the
holy Spirit) I asked whether they owned the
Scripture as the square Rule or Guide according to
whose sentence all the Knowledge of God and of
our selves, the Knowledge of Gods Worship and
Service and our own Blessedness and Salvation was
to be determined, yea and the Spirit within them
to be tryed, determined, approved and condemned
also.</p>
            <p>They still fled to this <hi>Burrough,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servd to be Gods standing outward Record &amp; witness.</note> the Spirit that
gave forth <hi>Scripture</hi> is greater then the <hi>Scripture:</hi>
the spirit is in us, that Spirit only opens the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
the Spirit is immediate and infallible and
they only who have this Spirit know the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
I answered that I maintained the inward
breathing of the holy <hi>Spirit</hi> more than themselves,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43125:76"/>
for I quoted before <hi>Luke 11. viz.</hi> that we ought in
all our <hi>Preachings, Hearings, Readings, Prayings,
&amp;c.</hi> to beg the help of the <hi>Spirit</hi> called the Finger
and Power of God: and yet I also maintained that
this Record, this Word Will or Mind of God writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and pen'd by chosen Pen-men as Pens in the
hand of his holy Spirit, and so miraculously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
from the Rage of the Devils fiery Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>Babilonian, Assyrian, Romane</hi> and <hi>Popish Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants</hi>
and that much among the Jewes and Papists
(and much by their meanes also though they hate it)
I say this Record is the outward and external <hi>Light,
Lanthorn, Iudge, Guide, Rule</hi> by which God wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth
himself and his Truth in the World, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth
and feedeth his saints in their Dispersions,
discovers and reforms the defects and wanderings of
his People (as in <hi>Iosiah</hi> his finding this Record,
and <hi>Ezekiel &amp; Iohn</hi> eating the Book, out of which
the holy Spirit inspired them to prophesie to Kings
and Peoples <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tis true who doubts it but that God and the
Spirit were before the Scriptures, and so he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Creation, before Christ Jesus was born, and
his Redemption actually accomplished: are the
works of God therefore, and the several Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Institutions and Instruments of God in
their several times and [91] places of any whit less
power or esteem because the most holy <hi>God</hi> and his
most holy Spirit were before them? <hi>Iohn the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi>
saith that Christ Jesus was preferred before him,
for he was before him and he was not worthy to
unloose the Shoe-latchet of Jesus the <hi>Lamb</hi> of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:43125:77"/>
God; and yet for the fulfilling of all Righteousness
the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> must come to <hi>Iohn</hi> to be baptized
of him, and the holy <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> will declare
himself to be true by the holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
all other Spirits to be spurious false and Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards
and notwithstanding their cracking and prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Light if they slight this outward standing
<hi>Record</hi> and Witness of God in the World it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is no light in them,</p>
            <p>One of these two must be done either we must
subscribe to the <hi>Papists</hi> and by their pretended
Spirit and Church find out and authorize the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<note place="margin">The holy Scripture the only outward standing Rule &amp; Record like the Records in the Tower</note>
just as the <hi>Foxians</hi> say, or else we must with

maintain Learning study the Scriptures, search the

            <p>While we were thus discoursing <hi>W. Edmundson</hi>
propounded this Similitude,<note place="margin">The Holp Scriptures are Gods Love-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</note> if I should write a letter
to a friend and subscribe my name <hi>W. Edmundson,</hi>
doth it follow therefore that the Letter is <hi>W. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundsons?</hi>
I answer that the Quakers do affirm
that the Scripture is within them, what is the eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
of that? but that the Light which they and
every man in the World hath within them (the
Christ the Spirit which every one hath) is Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and in a sence I said it was a Truth that <hi>W. E.</hi>
his letter to his friend was <hi>W. Edm.</hi> not only a
<hi>Declaration</hi> of his word, mind or will to his Friend,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:43125:77"/>
but in a respect his mind and will it self that he
sent in Writing to his Friend, and so the Scripture
in a Sence is Gods mind and Will to us.</p>
            <p>Upon this occasion I told them that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
were the <hi>Love Letters of Christ Iesus</hi> to his
<hi>Church,</hi> as the <hi>Love-Letters</hi> of some mighty <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch</hi>
to his Betrothed Queen or Empress, they are
dear, not as common <hi>Paper</hi> and <hi>Ink,</hi> but as the
<hi>Good-Will,</hi> the dearest Love and heart of the King
and Emperour himself: and thus are holy <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
highly <hi>prized</hi> and embraced, and laid up in
the heart and bosome of the true <hi>Children of God,</hi>
92] believed listned to, and followed as the voice of
<hi>Christ Iesus</hi> to his true sheep and Spouse: the
<hi>Bastard Children</hi> and the <hi>Wolves</hi> covered only with
the <hi>sheepskins:</hi> they have other <hi>Words, Letters</hi> &amp;
<hi>Spirits, 2 Thes.</hi> 2. whatever they prate of Scripture,
and speak brave swelling empty words as <hi>Iude</hi>
speaketh.</p>
            <p>Tis true as <hi>G. Fox</hi> all along in his Book vapours
that the Spirit was before Scripture, and gave forth
Scripture: but I proved before, that their Spirit,
their Light, their Christ, were but hellish <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
the spirit of Sathan, and a false lying Christ,
&amp;c. 2. The Dispensations of God were many and

               <note place="margin">Luthers <hi>Light</hi>
               </note> he
freely confessed that the holy Scripture was his
first help, the second Meditation, the third earnest
Prayer to God to vouchsafe his Spirit to bless the
two former unto him. The Lord Jesus therefore
not only ordained his Messenger or Preachers of
his glad Tydings to <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh 20. 2. considered</note> but his Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
also, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. for those two great ends (as to
us) to wit,</p>
            <p>1. These things are written that you may believe
that Jesus is the Christ (to wit, that that individual
person and man called Jesus was the <hi>Christ,</hi> the
<hi>Messiah</hi> so long promised and expected (contrary to
the Blasphemous Fancies of the <hi>Quakers.</hi>)</p>
            <p>And 2. That Believing in him (that individual
person called Jesus, and not in a Fancy within) we
might have Life and Blessedness.</p>
            <p>It is no wonder therefore, that the <hi>Devil</hi> (the

the <hi>Pharisees, Iesuites</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> to make <hi>Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes,</hi>

the <hi>Candle of the Holy Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the Spirit Breath or wind of the <hi>Devil</hi> in

It is true the <hi>Iews</hi> (to whom the Oracles of God
were committed, <hi>to wit</hi> in the <hi>Old Testament:</hi> how
studious have they been in it, even to every Word,

My self have seen the <hi>Old Testament</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi>
most curious writing whose price (in way of trade)
was threescore pound, which my Brother a <hi>Turkey-Merchant</hi>
had and shewed me: But I speak of an

<hi>Luther,</hi> &amp;c <hi>viz.</hi> that he caused his six Pages each of

with the Scriptures had mighty Affection to the

<hi>Cups</hi> and <hi>Bowles</hi> the <hi>King of Kings</hi> was pleased to
convey the Wine (like <hi>Ahashuerosh</hi>) of his Eternal

            <p>It is wonderful to consider how much the study
of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and of the <hi>Hebrew and Greek

Tongues</hi> confounded and put to flight the <hi>Papists,</hi>

            <p>It is no wonder this Spirit of Lying cries out so

            <p>The blessed <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Witnesses</hi> of Jesus in all

meanes of Salvation:</hi> But to the second part, to
which <hi>G. Fox</hi> opposeth, I believe it is an <hi>Error,</hi> and
a damnable <hi>Error,</hi> and a Doctrine of <hi>Devils,</hi> to say
there is no other meanes of Salvation: for this

<hi>G. Fox</hi> sets at variance with the <hi>Meritorious Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
by Christ Jesus, between which there is an

by the mouth of his holy Prophets,</hi>

to us concerning the Lord Jesus then the

            </p>
            <p>2. Why should G. <hi>Fox</hi> here mention <hi>Cain,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Devil and the Quakers alleadging Scriptures</note> 
               <hi>Balaam,

(at the first dash for <hi>Cains, Baalams, Cores,</hi>
that they could not well tell how to miss them:
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43125:83"/>
Such persons no question, and the <hi>Foxians,</hi> and the

But doth the Divel cordially prize and love
the word of <hi>Prophesie,</hi> the <hi>Testimony</hi> and <hi>Witnesses</hi>
of Jesus? However he plainly here Confesseth that
the holy Scripture is so powerful that the very
Counterfeit, the picture and Name of it will do
him good Service, with such whom he desires to
cheat and Ruine. And yet <hi>secondly</hi> this shews the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
horrible wickedness,</hi> that although they love the
holy Scripture (for the general of them) as well as
doth their <hi>lying Father,</hi> yet turn they the Truth of
God into a lye, and with the ugly Spider sucks that
which he turns into poyson, even from the same
Flowers of Paradice, the holy Scriptures, from
whence the <hi>hony Bees,</hi> the true Believers, suck the
pure hony of Eternal Truth and Comfort.</p>
            <p>3. Again, what madness is it for this <hi>blind
Dreamer</hi> to ask his Opposite, whether the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
shines in a dark place until the [100] dawne?
&amp; whether they must be taken heed unto as to a
Light? For, how often is the holy Scripture even the
very Law before the Gospel,<note place="margin">No Light in the bold pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (to so much) the Quakers.</note> or glad News was
preached, adorn'd and beautified with the <hi>Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

world must know that if they attend unto whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perings
and peepings, <hi>Isai.</hi> 8. and leave the written
Law, the Word, and other Prophesies of Scripture,
or written Prophesies, Words and Oracles of God!
For all their Childish Vapourings and pratings of
their Light, the <hi>Eternal Father of Lights</hi> proclaims
them to be Children of <hi>howling darkness</hi> and that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43125:84"/>
there is no Light within them: I speak it with
horrour and Amazement, and also with sorrowful
Confidence that he that shall find a spark of true
Light either of the knowledge or grace of the
true Lord Jesus in this their <hi>Fantastick Light,</hi> he
shall find the Living among the Dead, he shall
prove the Prophets that spake, and the Lord God of
the Prophets whose word was spoke, to be Lyars,
for saying there is no Light within them.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Fox</hi> again demands, <hi>(Can any know the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
but with the Light within?]</hi>
               <note place="margin">The pure Scripture filthily abused.</note> And I ask him
what Light have the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Iews,</hi> and the

means in his <hi>Iesuitical, Diabolical Reservations,</hi> by
the <hi>Light within</hi> and by knowing the Scripture, his
meaning is known and Common, <hi>viz.</hi> except he
be one of those dark Souls called <hi>Quakers:</hi> But
did not the Devil bring a pertinent Scripture and

could have alleadged, though pointed and directed
as are the <hi>Papists, Iews</hi> and <hi>Quakers Allegations</hi> to a

was not before the Scriptures, But his Birth,

            <p>3. As for this saying, <hi>[They that have the Scripture

But receiving the Word from God, is, as they that
gave forth the Scriptures: which man lives by and

that the Scripture was the Ground of Christs Faith,
he was afore the Scripture was writ, and so fulfils
their Words, and is the Author and the Finisher of

their latter Books (as <hi>Christopher Houldsworths</hi>) and
some of theis latter Professions and Practices were
such that many of their Observes Conclude, that

[And the Magistrate is not to Level the Law with

            <p>G. <hi>Fox</hi> Answers, the Magistrate of Christ, the
help, Government for him, he is in the Light and
power of Christ: and he is to subject all under the
power of Christ, into his Light, else he [108] is not
a faithful Magistrate: and his Laws are agreeable
and Answer according to that of God in every
man: when men act contrary to it they do evil, so
he is a Terrour to the Evil doers, discern the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and the just from the vile, and this is a praise

               </gap>hat do well.</p>
            <p>I urged from hence, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> (and G, <hi>Fox</hi>
in his Book in many places) owne no Magistrates
but such as are godly that is in their dark Sence,<note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors.</note>
that be Magistrates for their Christ, be in the Light
and Power of Christ, for then say they, their Laws
are agreeable to that of God in every man.</p>
            <p>2. These their Magistrates (in the Light) ought
to subject even the Consciences and Souls of
all that be under them, by <hi>Corporal punishments</hi> to
come under the Power of Christ into the Light.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:43125:90"/>
3. This is Confirmed and sealed with a <hi>peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Doom</hi> upon the neglecter and failer, <hi>viz. [Else
he is not a Faithful Magistrate.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. I observe the Reason and Equity which they
alleadge of this subjecting all Subjects to the Light
of Christ, because such <hi>Magistrates, Laws</hi> and <hi>Edicts</hi>
are witnessed by God in every man, and therefore
he sins against God himself who breaks such a <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istrates
Command,</hi> and therefore is justly punished, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon my urging of some of these particulars
some of them desired to hear the <hi>Quotation</hi> read
again:<note place="margin">Yet will not own it.</note> so <hi>Iohn Burnet</hi> read the whole passage again,
and said, that G. <hi>Foz</hi> spake not there of matters of
Religion and Conscience, nor of the Magistrates
compelling men to be of his Religion and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but of punishing them for matters of wrong
between man and man, which are against the Light
in every mans Conscience, as <hi>Drunkenness, Whoredome,
Murther, Stealing,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>I Replyed, the Terms were such both of the
Question by the <hi>Opposite,</hi> and the Answer by G.
<hi>Fox</hi> which argue and Comprehend the matters of
Religion and Conscience, <hi>viz.</hi> If the Magistrate be
in the Light, and discern the mind of Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and G. <hi>Fox</hi> his Terms are the same about Christ
and the Light and bringing them subject to Christ.</p>
            <p>2. It is not Imaginable, that the Opposer would
question whether the <hi>Civil Officer</hi> ought not to
punish such incivilities and [109] Incivilities and
Inhumanities as <hi>Drunkenness, Whoredome, Stealing,
Murther,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore G. <hi>Fox</hi> must intend that
their Magistrates for Christ must Fight for their

when I come to Compare the <hi>Pope</hi> and them in the

<hi>Paul</hi> speak of his Measure in Holiness and Grace,

and they would fain make themselves &amp; others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that they are as truly perfect in their Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as God is, though their Holiness be not so much:
As if they were perfectly Gods, (though but little

there be any Measures and Degrees in God? whether
his Perfection in Holiness be not Holiness it self?
Wisdom it self, goodness it self, unto which there
there can be no Addition or [110] growth as we

               <note place="margin">The sixth Position.</note> 
               <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
to the</hi> sixth Position <hi>which was,</hi> viz. [The

matters of Gods holy worship, but also in the Doctrines
of Repentance, Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Assertion</hi> hath two main Branches: <hi>First,</hi>
that the Quakers Religion is an <hi>Heresie,</hi> and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>Hereticks</hi> in the matters of Gods worship.<note place="margin">The Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esie of the Quakers.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2. Not only so, (about the Circumstances of

differ) but also (which is more Lamentable and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous)
in the Doctrines of Repentance and Faith,
and the rest of the graces of Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>I told them <hi>first,</hi> that the word <hi>Hairesis</hi> Heresie,
in <hi>Greek,</hi> (from whence the word <hi>Hairetikos</hi> an

and a ugmented from the Greatness and <hi>Vitallity</hi> of
the matter of the Opinions, but the <hi>Formality</hi> and
<hi>Nature</hi> of it lay in the will and obstinacy thereof.</p>
            <p>

Error in the <hi>Foundation</hi> obstinately stood in: But
I said we had not time to enter upon a Dispute
about the word or thing at this time, the Substance
of my <hi>Affirmation</hi> was, that their Religion, Sect or
way was false, and gone from the <hi>Institution</hi> and
<hi>way</hi> of the Lord Jesus delivered by himself and his
Apostles, or <hi>Messengers:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. As to worship, they denyed the Converting
and gathering of the Saints into <hi>visible Assemblies,</hi>

the <hi>Ministers Invisible,</hi> the <hi>Baptisme</hi> and <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

            <p>The second (which was aur <hi>Position</hi>) was in those

works and Faith towards God: As for those two
Doctrines of laying on of hands, and of <hi>Baptismes</hi>
they concerned the Church, and worship, (concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Circumstances of which God is pleased to
permit his [115] Children to be lovingly differing
and discussing; the other four <hi>Repentance, Faith,
Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Iudgement</hi> (in which generally
Gods Children agree) in these also as well as in the
matter of worship, these wandring Souls are <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
that is, obstinately maintaining <hi>Notoriously
false</hi> and <hi>Anti-Christian Abominations,</hi> In so much
that the many Sects amongst the <hi>Protestants,</hi> yea,
and the <hi>Papists</hi> themselves do not so differ from <hi>a

            <p>1. Then as to Repentance,<note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peutance.</note> I said it was the first

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:43125:95"/>
wherein he turned back home again the whole
Soul unto himself, being revolted and run from
him into the Arms of Rebellion in the Fall of our
<hi>first Parents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the great point preached by <hi>Moses</hi> and
the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and more expressly by <hi>Iohn the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi>
and by the Lord Jesus himself: and when he
sent abroad his Apostles or Messengers into all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
they were to preach the Gospel or glad News
of the Forgiveness of sins according to <hi>Luke</hi> 24.<note place="margin">This 24th. of Luke I earnekly Insisted on.</note>
viz. that Repentance and Remission of sins should
be preached in his Name unto all Nations, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here about I remember they told me that it was

and of turning from all sin unto God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answered, that the <hi>Papists</hi> and they made a
shew and Colour of Repentance, but it had not the
Life and Substance of Repentance in it: It was no
more but an <hi>empty Title</hi> and <hi>shadow</hi> of Repentance:<note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and Quakers Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note>
we know the <hi>Papists</hi> define their Repentance by
these three. <hi>First,</hi> Contrition, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Confession,
and <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Satisfaction or Restitution.</p>
            <p>But I said the <hi>Protestants</hi> protested against this
Repentance of the <hi>Papists,</hi> and so against the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
for, who knew not the sorrow and Confessions
of <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> and the <hi>Philistins,</hi>
and <hi>Iudas,</hi> yea, and also the Restitution which <hi>Iudas</hi>
made, (not daring to keep in his hands that which
he had unjustly and wickedly gotten) and yet who
can truly ascribe unto these mens Repentance, the
Character and blessedness of a true Christian return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and coming home to God.</p>

               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:43125:95"/>
2. I said it is known in daily practice, that when
some times [116] <hi>Notorious</hi> and <hi>openly Flagitious
Persons</hi> profess to be <hi>Quakers,</hi> (for all their craking
of fear and trembling and Quaking) there hath
appeared no Sense of godly sorrow, of godly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition

be perfect Christians?</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Protestants</hi> both <hi>English, French</hi> and

            </p>
            <p>It is true, that many that hold the same <hi>Fanciful

            <p>From their Doctrine of, and their Heresie or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy

of Faith and Justification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the <hi>Papists</hi> did,

pleased, I would demonstrate by Instances out of
his Book all along that he Confounded and made
all one, both Faith and Ju- [118] stification, yea,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:43125:97"/>
and Sanctification, and made believing in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
but a <hi>meer Babel</hi> and <hi>Chaos</hi> of <hi>Nonsence</hi> and

Justification,<note place="margin">G Fox his horrible Confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Faith and all other Chistian Virtues and Graces together.</note> Sanctification, and all <hi>Christian graces,</hi>
yet to Confound and make them all one, is as to go
into a <hi>fair Garden,</hi> and say a Rose is every Flower
in the Garden: or to say, that the Letter <hi>A,</hi> or <hi>O</hi>
is every Letter in a <hi>Printers Box,</hi> or Book: Or to
say, that a <hi>Rebels</hi> receiving the <hi>Kings pardon,</hi> that is

and <hi>Adoption</hi> into the <hi>Favour</hi> and <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>

and <hi>Nonsensical Language</hi> is the Tongue or
Speech of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and G. <hi>Fox</hi> especially.</p>
            <p>2. I told them that although (with the <hi>Quakers</hi>
and <hi>Papists</hi>) G. <hi>Fox</hi> talkt much of Faith in Christ:
yet I had proved and further should,<note place="margin">True Faiah what it is</note> that the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
put out and obliterate the true Christ or Object
to be received and believed on, as before in the
matter of Faith, they put out the true living Eye
of Faith, and put in a painted, or <hi>Glass Eye</hi> in the
Room of it.</p>
            <p>True Faith is a Receiving of Christ Jesus as my
only King, Priest and Prophet: It is a believing

or <hi>Imaginary Christ</hi> in the mind of a man, or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:

up and Jugled away the Flesh of Christ Jesus, both
his and your own also altogether.</p>
            <p>This is a Trick of <hi>the Father of Lyes,</hi> and <hi>Iuglings</hi>
beyond that <hi>Monstrous Fancy</hi> of the <hi>Papissts Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi>
for although they turn the Bread into
the Flesh of Christ, yet they turn not the Bread of
Christ, nor the Flesh of Christ into their own
Flesh: The <hi>Quakers</hi> can give no Account what is
become of the Flesh or Body of that man Christ
Jesus, these <hi>Foxes</hi> have devoured the Lambs of God.
Miraculous and Monstrous is [119] the Papists <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous</hi>
and <hi>Bloody Fancy</hi> of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> but
not more miraculous and monstrous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then that
of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> which granteth Christ Jesus to have
been born, lived and dyed as We, &amp;c and yet now
Transubstantiated into a Spirit, and the <hi>Quakers
Flesh.</hi> So that in the Upshot, the Christ in whom
they believe is vanished (by an <hi>Hellish Chimistry</hi>)
into themselves, and it is most certain, (the Lord
open in great mercy some of their Eyes to see it)
they do believe on themselves, and that lying Spirit
within them.</p>
            <p>I remember, that hereabouts <hi>Iohn Burnet</hi> said, that
it was not true that they preached not true Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,<note place="margin">John Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net his Sermon</note>
and herein he fell into a Speech or Sermon to

Godliness, and Righteousness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he continued

            <p>I listned carefully and watcht his Ending (being

I speedily said (to this Effect) Friend you have here

to omit many Amplifications and Illustrations which
now I crave the Readers patience, while I present

            <p>I intended to have Charged them with the false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Hope,<note place="margin">The Hope peace and Joy of the Quakers</note> and Love, and Peace, and Joy

<hi>Secondly,</hi> That there is no other Glory to be hoped

            <p>To which I say, how many painted Anchors and

            <p>For, do they not overthrow the very Nature of

God <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. the Lye, which tells us that Hope is
not of things in possession, or which we see? doth
not <hi>Paul</hi> there tell us almost in plain Terms, that

            <p>2. Again, what Ignorance and simplicity is it to

good things which we hope for, Literally and prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly
upon the Promise, and the Power, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

(until they be fit to wean and fall to strong

               <hi>In</hi> Pag. 127. <hi>he brings in</hi> Iohn Bunyan <hi>saying,</hi>
[It is a Counterfietlng of the New Birth for men to
follow the Light wherewith men coming into the World
are enlightned.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>G.</hi> Fox <hi>Answereth,</hi> [which none comes to the New
Birth, but who comes to the Light, wherewith every man,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which believing in is a Child of the Light: believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>I Reply,<note place="margin">The new Birth of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</note> none are truly Converted, born again,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in a true Sense they come to Christ Jesus:
For the Scripture saith, <hi>he gives Repentance to Israel,
He is the Author and Finisher of our Faith:</hi> But that
Jesus Christ as God, (so the <hi>Quakers</hi> owne him) and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:43125:100"/>
as man (for so they also owne him) should be in
every man, and Woman, and Child in the World,
I have proved and shall prove it to be a <hi>blockish</hi> and
<hi>Devilish Fancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. If this Light, this Christ the Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and man be only a Spirit and not man,
why do the Scriptnre, why do the <hi>Quakere</hi> madly
say there was such a man, though they cannot tell
now what is become of him except he be (as they
say) within, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. If this Light, this Christ, this Mediator be
in every man, what should be the Reason that so
many <hi>Thousands</hi> and <hi>Ten Thousand</hi> of <hi>Millions</hi> see
him not? Only a few persons Cursing and Reviling
all the rest, and that say all but the <hi>Quakers</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived?
Can the Sun be in a Chamber and persons
not blind, but [123] seeing and awake, and using his
Light and yet not see it. Certainly it is but a <hi>painted
Sun</hi> that doth not shine equally on all, it is but a
<hi>painted Fire</hi> that doth not burn, and the <hi>Quakers</hi> are
but <hi>Pictures</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> and pictures of men to
argue aftet such a Rate, that Christ not only as
God, and Creatour should be in every man, but also
as the Mediator, as the Spirit, and yet not operate
according to the Nature of the Sun and Fire: It is
true, the Lord Jesus came into the dark world, and
their darkness comprehended him not to be He
that was to come, the <hi>true Messiah:</hi> but when Christ
Jesus as Mediator, the true or only Light shall
dwell in the Understanding and Will, and Memory,
and Affections of a man or Woman, and those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
be savingly inlightened by him as you write,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:43125:101"/>
and yet not Converted and saved by him, it can be
the Language of none but those that peep and mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Isai.</hi> 8. but have no true Light, but a false and
painted Light within them.</p>
            <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">The true and false new Birth.</note> saith <hi>Fox</hi> this turning to the Light within
is the New Birth: But the <hi>Holy Record</hi> saith, that
till the preaching of the Word, or Gospel, or glad
News come to the mind of a man, (ordinarily by
the Ear, and hearing, and preaching, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.)
there is no <hi>Faith,</hi> nor <hi>Covenant,</hi> nor <hi>Christ,</hi> nor God
in the Soul, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. and we are not only in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but darkness it self, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. and only by the

               </note> the blessing, <hi>Isai.</hi>
59., God shineth in our hearts, and not by any such
<hi>Immediate Fantastick Faith</hi> or Spirit, as the <hi>Anti
Christian Quakers</hi> dream of,<note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers put out the Eyes of their own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> yea, against the Light
of a twofold Experience in their own Souls.</p>
            <p>1. That many of them being enlightened and
formerly Convicted by the reading or preaching of
the Doctrine, Word or Will of God revealed in
the holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>2. That of their new Light (as they falsly and
foolishly prate) pretended to be brought unto their
Ears and knowledge by the means of these <hi>new
Apostles, Preachers,</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> so pretended of
Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>When God hides (that is by <hi>Spiritual Iudgements</hi>)
the Light of Scripture, of the Spirit of Reason,
and of Experience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who can find it out? No
man, no nor Devil can subsist one minute with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the power of <hi>Christs Eternal Power and God-head:</hi>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:43125:101"/>
[124] but when Christ Jesus comes into the
Soul as <hi>Mediator</hi> of the <hi>new Covenant,</hi> and be thus
idle and not operative in all mankinde in the
World, and not to Convert, and work belief in them,
which must be either because he cannot, or because
he will not, as the <hi>Leaper</hi> said, is as black and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous

            <p>Pag. 10. <hi>He brings in</hi> Iohn Bunyar <hi>saying, [It</hi> is
not Faith and works that justifies a man before God,
but it is Faith and good works which justifie in the
sight of men only, and such works will not [126] justifie in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:43125:103"/>
the sight of God: and he saith, that works is only to
justifie their Faith to be true before men.]</p>
            <p>G. <hi>Fox</hi> Answers, <hi>Abraham</hi> was not Justified only
to men by his Obedience,<note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Popish Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification by works.</note> but to God: And where
there is <hi>Faith</hi> there is <hi>Iustification</hi> which works by

only to Justifie them in the sight of men. For the
work of God is to do what he saith, &amp; the will
which who doth not is not Justified by so doing,
but to be beaten with stripes: who seek to be Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
by their Faith and works in the sight of men
are dead, Faith and works both.</p>

sent. It is true, it is the Command of God to
keep his Commands, but since the deadly Fall of
man, none, not one being able, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. (though <hi>Fox</hi>
deny it,) it is the work, the <hi>great work</hi> of God to fly
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:43125:103"/>
to that <hi>blessed Propitiation</hi> for poor sinners, (through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

the <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> of <hi>Iustice,</hi> and of <hi>Debt,</hi>
and that of <hi>mercy,</hi> and of receiving all as a <hi>Beggar,</hi>
and Condemned Rebels, <hi>poor proud Souls</hi> they know
not any difference between the Blood of Christ
Iesus and their own Blood, as we shall see afterward.</p>
            <p>3. Whereas he saith, that they do not Gods will
are not justified in so doing:</p>
            <p>I Answer, therefore it follows ronndly as his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
that they that do Gods will are justified in
so doing: that is their sins are pardoned as <hi>David</hi>
and <hi>Paul</hi> by pardon of Sin describe justification,</p>
            <p>127] Who sees not the subtlety of this <hi>Fox</hi> cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself and others with the divers signification
of this <hi>Latin word Iustification?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fox his playing with the word Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</note> It is true, a man

            </p>
            <p>I Conclude, that by these hints a broken hearted

Doctrine of true Repentance, true Faith, &amp;c these

            </p>
            <p>6 The <hi>Papists</hi> generally use not, nor have the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:43125:107"/>
holy Scripture, (no not in their Devotions) in their
own Tongue, but in the <hi>Latine,</hi> (the <hi>Whores Tongue
of Italy:</hi>) therefore no wonder they prize it not:
but even the <hi>Lights</hi> or <hi>Luminaries</hi> so pretending,
amongst them disuse it,<note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and Quakers slighting holy Scripture</note> Care not for it, read it not,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> many have it not: So that <hi>Luther</hi> tels us that
in <hi>Thirteen years</hi> or more he saw not a Bible in his
College at <hi>Erford,</hi> until by Gods merciful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
he came to see one, to his own &amp; the Comfott
of <hi>Thousands,</hi> &amp; <hi>Luther</hi> tels us that at one great As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of the <hi>Emperour</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> the <hi>Protestants</hi>
of <hi>Germany</hi> had Conveyed a Bible on the Table:
The <hi>Cardinal</hi> being first come he opened the Book,
and read here and there in it, (it is like he had not
seen [132] it before in his Life,) In comes one of
the <hi>Popish Princes,</hi> and askt the <hi>Cardinals Eminency</hi>
what Book he had there?</p>
            <p>He Answerred, I know not: but I am sure it is
agaiust us, and it is laid here for that purpose. Oh
the Infinite mercies of God to us in our times, and
our Infinite Debt to his Infinite goodness, and our
Infinite guilt in neglect of it:</p>
            <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> at first took off themselves,<note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and Quakers would be rid of the Scripture</note> 
               <hi>Families</hi>
and <hi>Assemblies</hi> from any use of it: Their Spirit they
Crake that made the Scriptures supplies all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The
<hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> both have said and printed, that
if the Scripture were consumed &amp; quite taken out of
the world, there would be no Loss, so long as they
have the Spirit. The Truth is I could by Arguments
many make it appear that the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi>
love the holy Scriptures no better than <hi>Goliah</hi> loved
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:43125:107"/>
               <hi>Davids stone and sling?</hi> nor no better then the Devil
loved <hi>Christs Gegraptai, It is written: It is written:</hi>
for the <hi>Papists</hi> and the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and the Devil
knows that if the holy Scriptures be Exalted, as
the revealed will or word, or Declaration of the
mind of God, down-falls their pretences of <hi>Tradit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions</hi>
and <hi>Revelations,</hi> whereby the <hi>Devil deceivs</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and <hi>himself also.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> shake hands in the
most <hi>hellish Doctrine</hi> of Justification by what is
within us,<note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and Quakers unite against the Blood of the Lord Jesus</note> by what Christ works within us, in short,
by what is called Sanctification put for Justification,
and the forgiveness of sin, in and for the merits of
the Lord Jesus freely imputed and given to us:
The <hi>Papists</hi> use the word <hi>Inherent Righteousness,</hi> but
the <hi>Quakers</hi> bogle at the word not finding it in the
<hi>English Bible,</hi> yet they agree that by the works of
Obedience, yea, and also by the Acts of their own
<hi>Inventions</hi> and <hi>Superstitions,</hi> they can make a pardon
under a hedge to themselves, and Crake that they
have received a pardon and Justification sealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Broad Seal of Heaven</hi> to them, but it is
against the glory of <hi>the King of Heaven,</hi> and against
the glory of <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and his <hi>glorious Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
and their own <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5 The <hi>Quakers</hi> are <hi>Papists</hi> in that Spirit of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi>
which they arrogate to themselves,<note place="margin">The Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of Papists and Quakers</note> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending

Truth,</hi> speak <hi>Immediately</hi> in [133] them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though
herein they differ, the Pope infallibly expounds

word is Gospel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, all men have this Spirit,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:43125:108"/>
and need no <hi>Teacher,</hi> and yet what an <hi>horrible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictious
noise</hi> is there of the <hi>Quakers, Apostles,
Messengers, Ministers, Preachers</hi> He and she sent into
<hi>Old-England,</hi> and <hi>New-England, Scotland, Ireland,
Turky, Italy,</hi> to bid people hearken to the <hi>Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Spirit</hi> within?</p>
            <p>6. The <hi>Quakers</hi> are <hi>Papists</hi> in that high lofty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of their Perfection,<note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</note> when <hi>Calvins time</hi> this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
came from Hell under the name of <hi>Spirituals,</hi>
and when of latter years in <hi>Lancashire</hi> under the
Name of <hi>Grindletonians,</hi> all their Religion turned
chiefly upon these two Hinges.</p>
            <p>1. They could not sin, were perfect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. They did nothing, said nothing,<note place="margin">The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</note> but God and
the Spirit did all.</p>
            <p>7. The <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> are great Friends in
their Notions &amp; practice of <hi>Revelations, Visions,
Dreams, Impulsions</hi> and <hi>Inspirations:</hi> He that hath
known so much as I have known of both their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
this way, and hath read their <hi>Legends</hi> as I have
done, and can Instance in particulars as I can, will
say, it is a <hi>foul, Popish, Devilish Spirit</hi> that haunts
them (both under this fine pretence) to turn <hi>both off
from the words of Iesus,</hi>

            <p>8. What <hi>Cart Loads</hi> of <hi>Traditions</hi> and <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
have the Papists, and I believe if the <hi>Quakers</hi> have
opportunities and means (as the Papists have had)
they will not be behind them: what a noise is made
about uncovering or bowing the Head, Knee, for
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:43125:108"/>
Courses of wearing of Lace, (yea, <hi>Bands</hi> and <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands</hi>

<hi>Idle, popish Trash and Trumpery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. The Papists and Quakers are B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ethren in Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
in their Affirmations that the Pope is not <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Christ,</hi>
and that [135] the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not
the <hi>great Whore:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers and Papists agree that that hge Pope is not Anti-Christ</note> The Papists Affirme that <hi>Anti-Christ</hi>
is not yet come, and that he shall come just
in the end of the world, and shall finish all those
wonders in the <hi>Revelations</hi> in three years and a half:
The Quakers though they hold Papists and Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
(all except the Quakers (to be <hi>Anti-Christians;</hi>
(&amp; as <hi>Fox</hi> doth) cast back all the Prophesies of
false Christs, false Prophets, and <hi>Anti-Christ</hi> to the
time of the Apostles themselves: yet the <hi>great
Whore</hi> and the Devil, and sin, (upon the point) they
simply Confound and make all one; as may be seen
in <hi>Fox</hi> his Title to this great Book, and other of
his and their writings.</p>
            <p>10. It may be wondred why the Popes when made
or created by an h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mane &amp; Devilish <hi>Fiat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers not owning freely their Names.</note> they
change their Name, and why the Quakers guided
by the same <hi>Hellish Spirit</hi> and <hi>Fancy,</hi> are so dainty
and tender about owning their Old names: The
Histories say, the <hi>Original</hi> with the Popes was with
him who was <hi>Os porce,</hi> or Swines snout, by Name,
and was not thought fit being raised so high to bear
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:43125:109"/>
so low and fordid a Title. If it were so then, yet it is
nothing now but their <hi>horrible pride</hi> being in their
Conceits so high, so Infallible, so perfect, to scorn
to be like other men that are but Hogs Snouts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. The Papists and Quakers are led by one Spirit
of feigned holiness,<note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers and Popish Monks and Munns all one.</note> Devotion, monkish Solitariness,
<hi>&amp;c,</hi> Their Monks and Friers and Nunns must be
sequestred from the world, medle with no faecular
and worldly business, which is no more but the
Beggars Life, and therefore justly called <hi>Fratre
Mendicantes</hi> Begging Friars, and the Indians Life,
formerly the men laying all Labour upon the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and all this is no more than hunger and Ease,
the Dogs Life also. It is true, the Apostles by a
true Light ought to have <hi>worldly maintenance,</hi> but
<hi>Paul</hi> wrought day and night with his hands, which
I never read of any of these lying Apostles, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
in all their Travails to have done.</p>
            <p>12. The Papists and Quakers tongues are both
spitting and belching out Fire from one Fire of
Hell:<note place="margin">The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Mother,</hi> our Church say the <hi>Papists</hi> have no God
to their Father: the <hi>Protestants</hi> hope and speak
Charitably of the Salvation of many among the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi>
but the <hi>Papists</hi> have no Charity for any that
bow not to the Image: and the <hi>Quakers</hi> (as G. <hi>Fox</hi>
for the rest) Judge all that differ from Christ that
is themselves to be in the <hi>Delusion,</hi> in differing from
them, and if they dare to oppose them, <hi>Dogs, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
Reprobates, Vipers, Cains, Pharisees, Devils,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:43125:109"/>
13. The <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> are <hi>Firebrands</hi> both
in the matter of Persecution or hunting such as
differ from them.<note place="margin">The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting Spirit of the Papists and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</note> It is known that the <hi>Papists</hi> cry
out that they persecute none but the <hi>Tares,</hi> (the <hi>Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards,</hi>
the <hi>Hugenots,</hi> the <hi>Wolves,</hi> the <hi>Hereticks,</hi> &amp;c.)
That the <hi>Quakers</hi> as do all <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi>
cry out against all Persecution when it is their own
Cases, I say the <hi>Quakers</hi> most vehemently cry out
against violence, against Creatures, but against their
Corruptious and Corrupt Principles: And yet as for
the <hi>Papists</hi> let it be considered whether there be
any one <hi>Religious state</hi> known in the world that
Answers that woman drunk with the Blood of the
Saints, and <hi>Witnesses of Iesus</hi> Comparably so near
as doth the Estate of the <hi>Romish Church</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the <hi>Quakers</hi> two things I say:</p>
            <p>1: Their Tongues are the most Cutting and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of any that I can hear of professing the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Reformation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Tongue and hand.</note> and it is certain, where the
Tongue is so, that the Heart is so first, and where
the Heart is so, the Tongue and Hand do never part
Company: and therefore they will be as bitter and
Cutting in Hand also, where God pleaseth to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a Sword to fall into it.</p>
            <p>2. I have proved, and shall prove in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
that G. <hi>Fox, Ed. Burroughs</hi> and <hi>Iohn Stubs,</hi>
&amp;c. maintain in their writings not only a <hi>Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Power</hi> in the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and in none else, rashly
not only to punish by the <hi>Material Sword</hi> Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:43125:110"/>
against men, but also sins against [136
God, his Church, his Christ, his worship and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>2, As for the Agreement between the <hi>Arminians</hi>
and the <hi>Quakers,</hi> I told them that the Papists and
the <hi>Arminians,</hi> the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Semipelagians,</hi> and
the Quakers were so Confederate and one, that in
naming one I named the other</p>
            <p>1. As to the Power of Nature and Free Will
in heavenly and Spiritual matters</p>
            <p>2. As to the loosing of <hi>true Saving Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. As to <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>predestination</hi> in time,<note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians.</note> upon
<hi>Obedience,</hi> &amp; <hi>Rejection</hi> and <hi>Reprobation.</hi> upon <hi>Rebellion</hi>
and <hi>Disobedience.</hi> Contrary to the true Protestant
Doctrine of a <hi>Certain Number</hi> of Gods Elect or
Chosen drawn by mercy, out of the Lumpe of Lost
Mankind according to Gods Appointment from
<hi>Eternity,</hi> by his Call in Time, by his holy Word
and Spirit: and all from this Grace and Spirit of
<hi>Regeneration,</hi> or <hi>New-Birth,</hi> it was not, it is not
possible that <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> or any Child of God
be <hi>un-Childed,</hi> can <hi>Finally</hi> or <hi>Totally depart</hi> and <hi>Fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Quakers are Brethren with <hi>Socinas</hi> and
the <hi>Socinians</hi> following him, in making Christ a
<hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Figure,</hi> a <hi>pattern</hi> and <hi>Example</hi> how Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians
ought to walk.<note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers and Socinians Oneness</note> Not that the Blood which he
shed upon the Cross at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was a <hi>sufficient
price</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> unto God for the sins of the
whole world.</p>
            <p>Thus all the Quakers more <hi>Explicitly</hi> or <hi>Implici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely</hi>
speak, and <hi>Humphry Norton</hi> in print, <hi>viz. Can
one mans Obedence and Suffering pay a price to God
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:43125:110"/>

the <hi>Free Grace</hi> of God in <hi>pardoning Sin,</hi> and send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that man Christ Jesus to be a <hi>pattern</hi> and <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
to all that will follow him.</p>
            <p>But they endure not to think that the Flesh and

               </gap>bstance of all the Quakers Teachings? For
although they preach Gods mercy and Grace, and
talk of such a Thing as the Blood of Christ Jesus:
Yet upon the point,<note place="margin">Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus but a Fancy with the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</note> that <hi>Body,</hi> that <hi>Blood,</hi> that

not a <hi>Literal, Real</hi> and <hi>Substantial matter;</hi> And
when they are forced to Confess such a man to have
been (though the Term <hi>Humane,</hi> G. <hi>Fox</hi> doth bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
and start as at a <hi>Rattle Snake</hi>) yet then examine
them (as I have done) what is become of him:
then he is vanished into a <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Ghost,</hi> and there
was never any such thing as a Man you talkt of:
And this is a <hi>Devilish Iesuitical Trick</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi>
have beyond the <hi>Socinians</hi> concerning the Body and
Sufferings of Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>I might here Insist upon the <hi>Quakers Notorious

to some that we might not be discouraged to go on

viz. [The People called Quakers in Effect hold no God,
no Christ, no Spirit, no Angel, no Devil, no Resurrection,
no Iudgement, no Heaven, no Hell, but what is in man.</p>
            <p>I told them that it was true, that in words and
Terms they professed and maintained all these, as
other <hi>Protestants</hi> did, but if their writings were Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
and especially this of G. <hi>Fox</hi> which I had
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:43125:115"/>
there by me it should appear that what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
in one place they overthrew in another: I
told them that they had there <hi>George Fox</hi> his Book
as well as I, and if <hi>Iohn Stubs</hi> would turn to them I
would name the <hi>Quoted Pages,</hi> and read them and
he might read them also.</p>

on the matter which was that <hi>G. Fox</hi> imagined such

               <hi>Iohn Stubs</hi> here read the words of <hi>G. Fox</hi> and said,<note place="margin">About Gods Breath.</note>
the reason was to be weighed which <hi>G. Fox</hi> used
which was; For it came out of him, and that
which came out out of him is of him, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
in him. To this end he desired the word in
<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. might be viewed, which he turned to and
read, viz. <hi>God breathed into him the breath of life
and man became a living Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Sam. Gorton</hi> sen. desired to speak,
and said, If it be affirmed that God can be divided,
&amp; that man was a <hi>Part of God,</hi> the <hi>God-head</hi> was
destroyed and the <hi>Soul of man,</hi> and upon this <hi>Basis</hi>
all the rest would follow which was asserted in this

our <hi>Translation,</hi> viz. <hi>God breathed into him the breath
of life, Mr. Gorton</hi> said it was <hi>Lives</hi> in the Margin,
the breath of <hi>Lives,</hi> which <hi>Iohn Stubs</hi> acknowledged.</p>
            <p>It is frequent in their Books, (when they will
speak plainly) for them to confess that God breathed
forth himself into <hi>Adam,</hi> and that ther fore mans

as the body of a dog or beast so it vanisheth: But
as for the <hi>Spirit,</hi> they say that returns to God, that

            <p>About this time <hi>W. E.</hi> said, what dost thou tel

we will not believe thee! But just here rose up a

against the Quakers, yet he could witness to
the truth of these speeches of the Quakers, for one
of them had spoke as much to his face lately at
<hi>Newport</hi> on <hi>Rhode-Island:</hi> but I still laboured to
keep down heat and therefore I told them I would
not trouble them with <hi>Proofs</hi> from elsewhere, but
from their own <hi>writings,</hi> and from that of <hi>G. Fox</hi>
there present, and therfore I prayed them to turn
to <hi>Pag.</hi> 39. where <hi>G. Fox</hi> brings in <hi>Magnus Bine</hi>

               <hi>The Saints are neither in the fulness of the

that be out of this part of the <hi>Fulness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I said, that <hi>G. Fox</hi> rose up contrary to what <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus

<hi>G. F.</hi> his words alone, his meaning alone, and keep
to the words. I told them the substance of my

to his Adversaryes: I took <hi>Fox</hi> his own word for

            </p>
            <p>I think here it was that <hi>W. E.</hi> said further, If

               <hi>We came to the ninth Proposal, the second in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to be debated at</hi> Providence, <hi>viz</hi> [all that the
Quakers Religion requires externally and internally to
make Converts or Proselytes, amounts to no more then
what a Reprobate may easily attain to and perform.]</p>
            <p>I did not (the Father of Spirits is my holy wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness)

against either Teachers or Followers called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers:</hi>
it is true they do so against all that ever were
not or are not or shall not be in their Opinion, but
my hope is, that many amongst these misled and

may be of their Religion, and may have gotten all
that their Religion requires or performs, yea, all
that their Principles call for outwardly or inwardly,
and yet not be accepted but rejected from the holy
and gracious presence of God.</p>
            <p>I told them that I had this notion from a man

all Popery preacht to the making of Converts or

            <p>I say the same of common Protestants, and of the

their talk, their Garments, &amp;c. But,</p>
            <p>1. I told them that true Repentance lay in a

            <p>3. <hi>That as blessed</hi> Iohn Bradford <hi>said to God:</hi>

Fornication, Adultery, and all kinde of Wickedness.</p>
            <p>156] 4. That I have not so much in me as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<hi>Deliverance,</hi> nor to be sensible of any need of it.</p>
            <p>5. That it is only mercy and rich free Grace
that worketh in me or any Soul a Sence of my
Condition a Sence of Justice a Sence of Mercy.<note place="margin">Iacobs Ladder of true Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity.</note>
            </p>
            <p>6. That it is Mercy only worketh a willingness,
a new desire, new Affections towards my Maker,
towards my Ransomer, who paid his <hi>Bloud,</hi> his
<hi>Heart-Bloud,</hi> the <hi>Bloud of God</hi> to ransome and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
me.</p>
            <p>7. That in this work, Mercy not only worketh
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:43125:124"/>
a Sence, a thirst after Pardon and Peace with my
Maker, but also after a <hi>Conformity</hi> and <hi>Likeness</hi> unto
God.</p>
            <p>8. Because I cannot reach this, the Mercy and
Pitty of God worketh in my Soul a longing after
God, and after the turning of the whole Soul unto
God, and after those seven Evidences of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>9. This is in true Christian <hi>Repentance</hi> and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>Much of this I spake publickly, as also that no

this <hi>Iacobs Ladder,</hi> much less upon those higher

               <note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Spirit far from purity and Holiness.</note> and evidencing them to be lead

            <p>5. It is wonderfull how their spirit (professing to

bloudy spirit of the <hi>Papists,</hi> against the Witnesses
and Martyrs of Jesus, compiled by that heavenly

spirit (in <hi>Iames Purnels</hi> Watcher) upbraidingly

only pretending to understand supernatural and
miraculously (in a trice and immediately) what is
to be gotten by honest and faithful labour and
industry, the holy will and mind of God from the
true Original Copies.</p>

               <hi>God,</hi> unto which they say they are restored by <hi>Christ

is no <hi>New-come spirit,</hi> I have know nit almost
sixty year, and what a motion was made and urged
by some (whome I can name) for Plantations in

            <p>These our <hi>Adamites</hi> are led by a more Savage
and Barbarous, and Monstrous Spirit, the which
under the vizird and mantle of Religion deceives
them, and of being a sign to others: And this
very bruitish practise have kept some Women (too
much inclin'd to them) from falling into their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
puddle, and of returning some which were left
by Gods Justice to go too far amongst them sure we
are the holy spirit of God (all along) abhors the
appearance of uncleanness,<note place="margin">Quakers driven on by the old Spirit of the Adam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</note> and commands the vail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

            <p>I have been too long upon the easiness of their
Religion, and of the agreement of it with corrupt
and rotten Nature which slides into it as easily as
Brooks and Rivers slide and run down into the
Ocean.</p>
            <p>There be two other causes of falling into false
Religions or ways of worshipping God.</p>
            <p>1. Hope of Gain, which was the <hi>Sechemites</hi> Bait:
(the sweet Musick propounded by <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar.</hi>)
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. The fiery Furnace, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>These moderate times have not driven the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
to bow down to their Spirit for fear of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:43125:128"/>
and the fiery Furnace but Sathan knew
well enough that the Corruption of Nature,<note place="margin">The rising of the Quakers</note> and
the hope of Gain and Glory would cheat to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
(as all may see it hath done:) Sathan knows
that some have a moving and travelling Spirit, and
cannot rest in a sedentary or quiet life:) Some are
of a rising, aspiring Spirit (though neither from
Birth nor Breeding, nor abilities) and therefore cry
down all Honour or respect to be given to any
(but themselves) some are false and [161] rotten in
their <hi>Profession,</hi> and ready to fall and tumble when
any <hi>strange wind</hi> of Temptation blowes upon them.</p>
            <p>7. Some may be <hi>Sincere</hi> and upright to God in
the <hi>Root,</hi> but <hi>Weak,</hi> and not so rooted in the <hi>Holy
Scriptures,</hi> as the Disciples themselves, who won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
for a time what the <hi>Rising</hi> from the dead
should mean,<note place="margin">Diverse Sorts suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by God to fall into the Quak Ditch.</note> and had need of their <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Take heed and beware</hi> of the <hi>Leaven</hi> of the
<hi>Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and <hi>Sadduces,</hi> &amp;c. Some
truly fear God, but have neglected the purity and
chastity of <hi>Gods holy Worship,</hi> and have reserved in
a weak Conscience a liberty of playing the <hi>Whore</hi>
against a jealous <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Husband.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But generally they that are taken by the <hi>Quakers
Bait</hi> are such as never loved <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> in Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as the Scripture speaketh, neither within nor
without, and therefore suckt in <hi>Nicolds</hi> and <hi>Nailors,</hi>

of him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:43125:128"/>
The <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> tels us that some will plead with
him at the last day, that they have heard him
<hi>Preach,</hi> that they have been at his <hi>Table,</hi> that they
have prophesied themselves, <hi>cast out Devils</hi> in his
Name, and in his Name done many <hi>Wonderfull
things:</hi>
should not this make every Soul that calls
it self <hi>Christian,</hi> startle and look about them, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when they hear Christ Jesus say, <hi>depart from me
I know you not ye workers of Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I told the Quakers that their <hi>Theora Iohn</hi> pretended
to write after the <hi>Spirits</hi> Dictate, a volume in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
Greek, Latine, Arminiack,</hi> &amp;c. which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
he understood not: what if it should please
Gods infinite Wisdom, to suffer the Quakers or
others to speak and understand all <hi>Languages,</hi> to
work great <hi>Miracles,</hi> yet if they come under the
Note Christ gives them, of <hi>Workers of Iniquity,</hi>
they fulfill the termes of my <hi>Position,</hi> and prove but
<hi>False</hi> and <hi>Reprobate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the true and infallible distinguishing
<hi>Character</hi> between the true <hi>Legitimate</hi> and the <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard</hi>
and false <hi>Christian:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The great distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of true and false Pretenders</note> The soul of the <hi>True</hi>
is broken for Sin, as Sin, as opposite to God, as fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
in his eye: The soul of the <hi>False</hi> is broken for
Sin as bringing temporal Loss or shame, or pain,
and beside temporal, Eternal. The soul of the
true, is broke off from Sin, from the least Sin, [162
from the appearances of sin from the occasions of
Sin, from the thought of Sin as worse then all the
Afflictions of this life, or the Torments of Hell
to come. The soul of the False, hath secret Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

with Popery &amp;c) in the secret chambers and
Closets of the heart, at which they willingly wink,
and to find it (when they are put to it, yea and seem
to doe it) they are willingly remiss and negligent.</p>
            <p>Hence it was a famous Principle of the first <hi>New-English
Reformers,</hi> viz. to be Christianly carefull
that their Members gave <hi>Christian Evidence,</hi> (so far
as godly eyes of Charity could reach) of the truth
of their Conversion and turning unto God, which
for ought I know is not changed by their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors.</p>
            <p>It is dolefully true that many seemingly <hi>Elect,</hi>
prove <hi>Reprobate,</hi> and many truly <hi>Elect</hi> fall into many
great <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Sorrows.</hi> How black and dolefull
then is their Condition (such as the <hi>Papists</hi> the
<hi>Quakers</hi> and others) whose <hi>Religion Principles</hi> and

take a short turn of a quarter of an hour, I am

at that time.</p>
            <p>

            <p>I named then diverse Parallels between the <hi>Popes</hi>
and <hi>Quakers,</hi> I will now name all I can remember
I named, and will name some more at this present,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Popes</hi> have exalted themselves above

their Crowns, making them lead their horses, hold
their stirrups, kiss their toes, yea lye down under
their feet bodyes and souls, and submit their neck
to this abominable foot of pride, as the <hi>Scripture</hi>
calls it.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Quakers</hi> they know it is not yet time
to put on the <hi>Lions</hi> and the <hi>Eagles,</hi> but the <hi>Sheeps</hi>
and the <hi>Foxes</hi> Skin: but no man need question that
if God should please to let loose the <hi>Quakers spirit</hi>

to the full length of its tedder,<note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers hoast of their number.</note> as he hath done
that of the Popes, the spirit of the <hi>Quakers</hi> would
scorn to come behind the <hi>pope:</hi> For who sees not
how at the first, <hi>fledging</hi> and creeping out of the
<hi>Shell</hi> how they boast and vapour of their numbers?
We (said W. E. to me in publick at <hi>Newport</hi>) are a
great People, many thousands in <hi>England,</hi> many
thousands in <hi>London,</hi> besides <hi>Virginia, Barbados,

could boast of the many <hi>Waters, Peoples, Nations,
Tongues</hi> and <hi>Multitudes</hi> upon which the <hi>Whore</hi>
sitteth?</p>

prudent and moderate spirit) was up with the same
boasting of their <hi>Numbers,</hi> and all of them are
ready to cry up their <hi>Diana</hi> whome all <hi>Asia</hi> and

without either bowing the knee, or baring

and this out of an horrible and lying pretence, that
Christs amity (even in Civil things) respecteth no
mans person, that they may trample as Gods on all

uncovering his Head and bowing to the People,

blames those (as I hear) which violently and madly

Unity of which they childishly so crake and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,

for the Spirit within them they say gave forth
the Scripture, and is above the Scripture, and both

no losse if they were gone out of the World, for
the <hi>Papists</hi> say their Traditions, and their infallible

            <p>A seventh is that great point of horrible Pride
in both <hi>Pope &amp; Quakers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A 7 paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel between the Pope and Quakers</note> exalting the Dung and

as a <hi>Merit</hi> or <hi>Desert</hi> for the pardon of their sin, for
though they both Sophistically and Hypocritically
mention the <hi>Blood of Christ;</hi> yet they count the
business of this <hi>Christ</hi> (as the Pope said) but a <hi>Fable,</hi>
and indeed and truth through the Pride of their
high spirits they think God is beholding to them:
I have spoken to this already,<note place="margin">8 Parallel as to the sinless con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</note> and of that devilish
Pride of their being without sin: yet in this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of <hi>perfection</hi> the Quakers exceed the Doctrine
of the Papists: for generally the <hi>popes</hi> attribute this
purity but to some of their rare Saints. And 2.
Generally the Popes themselves confess themselves
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:43125:134"/>
to be sinners. 3. They give respect and civill hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to all estates, although in <hi>Spirituals</hi> and <hi>Civills</hi>
too they overtop them: But the high and lofty
<hi>Devill</hi> of the <hi>Quakers pride</hi> transcends all this: <hi>G.
Fox</hi> makes all his <hi>Saints born of God,</hi> that (literally
expounded) they cannot commit sin; yea, <hi>G. Fox</hi>
tells us that the Saints (that is his <hi>Foxians</hi>) are as
holy and perfect as God, not only like to God in
quality, but in equality also. They have the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Godhead in them bodily.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>G F</hi> his proud Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy as to God himself</note> That the

Hence he saith there is no distinction between God
and Christ, and the Spirit and themselves. Hence
it follows, that they are the Father, Son and Holy
Spirit (which by Devilish Chymistry) they can
prove: and that they are the <hi>Three that bare Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ord

            <p>It is true, this is not believed (no not by some

punisheth such height of <hi>Pride</hi> even in this present

            <p>I remember while we were declaring their proud
<hi>Disrespect</hi> to all men, <hi>Iohn Stubs</hi> said, That it was
their practice to pay tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and to give
Honour to whome Honour belonged. And I ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered
to this effect, that it was against their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and practices to shew respect to any mans
Person in the World. As for tribute they paid none
but what necessity and policy forced them to, and
notoriously backward here: But they knew that I
and <hi>G. Fox</hi> knew, and all the world might know
out of <hi>Fox</hi> his <hi>Writings,</hi> that the <hi>Quakers</hi> are the

            <p>
               <hi>We came easily (with their Good-will) to the
4th.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The 4th of the seven last Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> Position <hi>of the latter seven, which they read out
of the Paper (as willing to be out of ther pain) viz,</hi>

Destructive to the Conversion and Salvation of Soules
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:43125:135"/>
of People than most of Religions that are at this day
extant in the World.</p>
            <p>I said for the proof of this it was requisite to take
a short view of <hi>Religions</hi> and <hi>Worships</hi> in the world.
We knew that the Sons of Men were justly divided
all the world over into two Sorts,</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians Religion.</note> The wild and Pagan, whome God hath
permitted to run about the world as wild Beasts all
this great fourth Part of the World, and in some
of the other three.</p>
            <p>170] They acknowledge a great supream God
and Deity, Maker of all things, yet they acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge
(as other famous <hi>Civilized Nations</hi> formerly
have done) that there be many other Petty-Gods
and Deityes in Heaven and Earth, yea within their
own Bodies, yea whatever is extraordinary, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
or strange to them, they are presently apt to
ascribe a Deity unto it, though it be but <hi>Beast, Fowle
&amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Deity or higher Power ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by Indians.</note> and say it is a <hi>God.</hi> It is commonly known
that as their garments hang loose about their
Bodyes, so hangs their <hi>Religion</hi> about their Souls:
So that (to my knowledge) they are so far from
hindring any to come to God, that when they have
seen the grave and solemn <hi>Worship</hi> of the <hi>English,</hi>
they have often said of themselves and their own,
that they are all one <hi>Dogs</hi> in comparison of the
<hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second sort of men are the <hi>Civill</hi> brought to
<hi>Cloaths,</hi> to <hi>Lawes &amp;c.</hi> from <hi>Barbarisme:</hi> these also
the infinite Wisdome of God have pleased to leave
to variety of wayes of <hi>Worshipping</hi> the <hi>Heavenly
Majesty,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:43125:135"/>
Amongst others we find four most known and
eminent,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The four chief Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions of the World.</note> The <hi>Iewish Worship</hi> famous from Gods
own appointment by <hi>Moses &amp;c.</hi> 2. The <hi>Turkish,</hi>
famous for spreading from <hi>Mahomet</hi> to most of
thirteen parts of thirty in the World.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Popish,</hi> famous for spreading over <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
and other western parts of the world. 4. The
<hi>Protestant</hi> famous for so wonderfull a <hi>Revolt</hi> and
Seperation from the Popish. All these four pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
one God and supream <hi>Deity:</hi> but they differ in
two things, 1. In the <hi>Prophet</hi> or Meanes by whome
God speaks to man; the <hi>Iews</hi> cry up <hi>Moses,</hi> the
<hi>Turks Mahomet,</hi> the <hi>Papists</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
Christ Iesus</hi> in the Scriptures,</p>
            <p>The second great difference is in the <hi>Form</hi> of
Worship, which every one of these four great Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes
practice in various and different wayes as they
are perswaded.</p>
            <p>Our selves the <hi>Protestants</hi> are divided into two
Partyes,</p>
            <p>The first is entituled <hi>Episcopal</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
in Parochyal or Parishional Assemblyes.</p>
            <p>The second is <hi>Seperate</hi> from those National and
Parochyal Assemblyes, some more some less, and
those are now known to be First, the People called
<hi>Independants.</hi> 2. The people called <hi>Baptists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We that pretend the Christian Name against the
<hi>Iewes</hi> and the [171] <hi>Mahumetans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences among the Protestants</note> we mainly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
1. In matter of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> as <hi>Repentance, Faith,</hi>
&amp;c. 2. Of <hi>Worship, Discipline</hi> &amp;c. And we gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally
agree, that as the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> and <hi>Iewish</hi>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:43125:136"/>
Worship have little in them to tempt a Soul to
turn into them compar'd with the <hi>Christian,</hi> so those
Christians that differ each from other in point of
Doctrine and Worship both, as the <hi>Papists</hi> and the
<hi>Quakers</hi> doe to be farther from the truth of the
Profession of <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and more obstructive
and destructive to the Souls of men then the other
partyes; yea and the <hi>Papists</hi> not so much as the
<hi>Quakers,</hi> who wildly profess all <hi>Ordinances</hi> and
<hi>Ministers</hi> to be invisible, and yet are hypocritically
and ridiculously found to be as visible and open as
any.</p>
            <p>If the true <hi>Foundations</hi> of <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi>
be cast down it is in vain to talk of saving of <hi>Soules,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</note>
it is in vain to talk of Worshipping of God. The
<hi>Quakers</hi> (for all their craking of <hi>Quaking</hi> and <hi>Tremh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>)
their way is more easie of <hi>Worshipping God,</hi>
and of bringing persons to their <hi>worship of God,</hi>
then the way of <hi>Iewes</hi> or <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Papists,</hi> who to
my knowledge take more paines in <hi>Religion</hi> then
do the common Protestants: I confess they all do
but paint and guild over natures old and rotten

greatest care of any in the world for true <hi>Faith</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> came not neer that care of <hi>N-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

            <p>There are two sorts of godly Soules catcht up a

to predicate the goodness of rotten nature, hell and
damnation, and that false and hellish Gospel (or
good news) of poor rotten Natures <hi>Righteousness,
Satisfaction, Penances,</hi> and to the damning of
Souls, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Devil knows that after the witnesses have
done their work against Antichrist,<note place="margin">True Preachers or messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</note> and after their
slaughters! the Lord Jesus will send abroad his
<hi>Messengers</hi> to other Nations <hi>(Iews &amp; Gentiles</hi>) and
<hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> or a new vision of peace shall then
come down from Heaven among the Sons of men:
but for the present he stirs up these Jesuites and
Quakers (with brave titles and pretences) like so
many <hi>Mahomets</hi> (under pretence of <hi>Diogenes</hi> tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on <hi>Platoes Carpets</hi>) to fish for the smoak of this
Worlds <hi>Sodome,</hi> and no doubt but the <hi>Quakers</hi> will
use the Sword as much as <hi>Mahomet</hi> or the <hi>Iesuites,</hi>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:43125:138"/>
under the cloak and colours of love to Jesus and
saving of Souls.</p>
            <p>I confess that Charity hopes and believes all
things, and yet I say, cursed is that charity that
puts out the eye of Reason, the eye of Experience,
the eye of true affection to Christ Jesus, his Father
and his Wife to the Souls of his followers, and the
Souls of poor sinners <hi>Iews &amp; Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the saving of Souls,<note place="margin">The Earthly &amp; Heavenly Sword</note> it was a Thunder from
the heavenly mouth of Christ Jesus. They that
take the Sword shall perish by the Sword: as if he
should say, <hi>the Sword is not a saving but a destroying
Tool,</hi> in Soul-humbling, and Soul-saving: making
worlds of <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> but not true <hi>Protestants,</hi> true
<hi>Christians &amp; Followers</hi> of the true Lord Jesus, and
of his Father, and of his Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>174] The <hi>Spirit</hi> say the <hi>Quakers,</hi> why thats our
<hi>Weapon!</hi> the <hi>Sword of the Spirit</hi> the <hi>Word of God,</hi>
why thats the word of God Christ Jesus our Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon:
So saith <hi>G. Fox</hi> and all our <hi>Fantasticks</hi> out of
weakness and madness, not weighing what a person
the holy Records describe Christ Jesus to be,<note place="margin">A great mystery amongst Papists and Protestants</note> but
as foolish Children and Anticks in the Lord Mayors
shews, they cry out Christ and the Spirit only for a
shew and colour, I know it that the true Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
his holy Father, and Holy Spirit is as odious
both to <hi>Iesuits,</hi> and most <hi>Papists &amp; Quakers</hi> as the
Devil, yea infinitely more then the Devil himself,
as with Gods help I have and shall make it as clear
as the Noon dayes Sun.</p>
            <p>O you considering <hi>Protestants,</hi> see you not how
the Devil would rob you of that Sword with which
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:43125:138"/>
Christ Jesus overcame him <hi>[The Holy Scripture]</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the colour and cloak of the Spirit in the

            <p>The eternal Word,<note place="margin">The mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Farmers</note> and Son, and Sun of God the

ours, &amp;c. and to this end only they talk of Souls, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We now descended to the fifth and sorrowful
point of suffering which they read,<note place="margin">The 5th. of the last 7 positions</note> 
               <hi>viz. [That the
sufferings of the Quakers are no true evidence of the
Truth of their Religion.</hi>]</p>
            <p>At the reading of this they told me, that although
their <hi>Sufferings</hi> were great in all places whither the
Lord had sent them, yet they made not their <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi>
an Evidence of the truth of their <hi>Religion,</hi> &amp;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:43125:139"/>
therefore I might have been better advised then to
175] put this in among the rest of my <hi>Lyes</hi> and
<hi>Slanders</hi> as not considerable,<note place="margin">The suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</note>
and now not worth the
mentioning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answered, that I understood what they said, and
I undestood mine own affirmation also; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
their patience also while I offered my Proofs
to two Particulars,</p>
            <p>1. That in their <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Writings &amp;c.</hi> they do
make their <hi>Sufferings</hi> a great Evidence to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and others of the truth of their <hi>Way</hi> and
<hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This their <hi>Suffering</hi> is not valid as to the
proof of their <hi>Religion, Way</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> to be of
God. So then they bid me prove it if I could.</p>
            <p>I told them that I could find no <hi>Iewes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pauls and the Quak suffrings</note> no <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
no <hi>Protestants,</hi> that did so magnifie and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly

Tis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rue that <hi>Paul</hi> did more particularize his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
then other Saints in Scripture; but it was
also true that they were so exceeding great that
<hi>Paul</hi> seemed a <hi>None-Such;</hi> but beside that it was
upon some great <hi>Insultings</hi> of the <hi>False Apostles</hi>
against not only himself, but against the Truth of
Christ Jesus: neither of which is the <hi>Quakers</hi> case.
Beside, the <hi>Quakers Sufferings</hi> generally were not to
be compar'd with <hi>Pauls,</hi> and yet they set down such
exact accounts of every <hi>hour</hi> in prison every <hi>Stripe</hi>
in <hi>Whipping,</hi>

our</hi> Persecutors wickedness, <hi>and our</hi> Christian Faith
and Patience, <hi>who for his Truths sake can endure all
this.</hi> I said it was not rational to think, that men
professing such high <hi>Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi> should
declare such <hi>Lysts</hi> and <hi>Catalogues</hi> of <hi>Sufferings</hi> (as
<hi>G. Bishop</hi> doth to the world, of the <hi>Quakers Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in N. England,</hi> in his first and second <hi>History</hi>)
only in a childish Vapour, Ostentation and Vain-Glory,
much less in hopes of <hi>Reparation</hi> or any
worldly advantage, either in <hi>England</hi> old or new,
<hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>Virginia,</hi> &amp;c. and therfore Reason per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
that these Sufferings are held forth (as the
holy Spirit speaks of the Sufferings of the <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi>
2. Thess. 2.) as a manifest Token of the
<hi>righteous judgment of God</hi> rendering <hi>Tribulation</hi> to
their Persecutors, and <hi>Rest</hi> to themselves suffering
for the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I remember, <hi>Iohn Stubs</hi> said, they did not
boast of their [176] Sufferings, but bare them pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
for the Truths sake which they preached
and professed.</p>
            <p>I said I did not charge them to say in express
terms, We have lost so much outward <hi>Gain, Favour,
Friendship, Worldly Advantage</hi> for the Name of
Christ within us, can you say the like for the Christ
without you? We have endured <hi>Imprisonments,
Whippings, &amp;c.</hi> have you done the like? only this
I say, that as all <hi>Religios Iewes, Papists, Protestants
&amp;c.</hi> are confirmed in their Perswations by their
<hi>Sufferings,</hi> and do predicate them to others as <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi>
and <hi>Signs</hi> of the truth of their <hi>Doctrines,</hi>
and of Gods presence and Assistance with them: so
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:43125:140"/>
do the <hi>Quakers</hi> and that with more Particular and
exact <hi>Accounts</hi> then most of all the rest have done.</p>
            <p>I told them, I had observed much to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in <hi>G. Fox</hi> &amp; <hi>E. Burrowes</hi> in the Book by me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They bid me alleadge what I could out of them:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>E. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes</hi> his Epistle quoted.</note>
               <hi>I took up the Book, and they theirs, I directed
them to the</hi> 12th. <hi>Page of</hi> Ed. Burrowes <hi>his large</hi>
Epistle <hi>to</hi> G. Fox <hi>his Book in Folio where I read
this passage viz.</hi> And this we did with no small oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
and Danger: yea oftentimes we were in danger
of our Lives, through beating, abusing, punishing, hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
casting over walls, striking with staves &amp; Cudgels,
and knocking down to the ground: Beside, <hi>Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Scorning, Revilings, Hooting at,</hi> Scornings and
Slanderings, and all abuse that could be thought or
acted by evil hands and tongues, and oft carried before
<hi>Magistrates</hi> with grievous Threats, and sometimes put
in the Stocks, and whipped, and often imprisoned, and
many hard dealings against us, the worst that tongues
or hands could execute, sparing life. Of this all the
<hi>North Countreys</hi> can witness. And all these things
are sustained and suffered from People and Rulers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of our <hi>Faithfulness</hi> to the Lord, and for declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against the false Deceivers. For nothing save only
the hand of the Lord and his power, could have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
us and carried us through all this: neither for
any <hi>Reward</hi> outward whatsoever, or advantage to our
selves would we have exposed our selves to suffrings,
violence and dangers which befel us daily. But the
Lord was our exceeding great reward through all these
things, and kept us in the hollow of his hand, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the shadow of his wings, and gave us dominion in
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:43125:140"/>
Spirit over all our enemies, and subdued them before us:
and though Rulers and People were combined against us,
and executed their violence and in- [177] justice against
us, yet the Lord made us to prosper and grow exceedingly
in Strength, Wisdome and Number, and the hearts of
the people inclined to us, and the Witness of God in
many stirred for us: for to that in all Consciences,
Words and wayes we did commend our selves to be known
and approved.</p>
            <p>Hereto they suddenly said, What canst thou
make of this, but that <hi>Edward Burrowes</hi> said the
truth, that the Sufferings of the people called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
were very great, &amp; that he acknowledged the
powerfull hand of the Lord toward them in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
and delivering them: But this was far
from boasting or making it any <hi>Evidence</hi> of the
truth of their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I replyed, I prayed them to consider why pious
and conscientious Souls (as they would be reputed)
should give so large a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of their <hi>Sufferings.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation weighed.</note>
2. Profess it was only for their <hi>Faithfulness</hi> to the
Lord. 3. Declare that it was the hand of the Lord
that kept them, 4, That he only could do it: I
sayd the <hi>Weaving</hi> and <hi>inter-weaving</hi> of these Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
speak plainly that for their <hi>Faithfullness</hi> to
the Lord and his Truth in declaring and suffering
for it, the Lord had been faithfull to them in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
them and comforting them in all these Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrings
for his Name sake. Why should wise men
use all these words but to this end, of <hi>Evidencing</hi>
their <hi>Faithfulness</hi> to God, and Gods <hi>Faithfulness</hi> to
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:43125:141"/>
After some words had about these kind of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
in <hi>Ed. Burrowes</hi> and other of their Writings,
I told them that we must come to that ancient and
true Maxime,<note place="margin">What true Suffering is.</note> 
               <hi>Causa facit Martyrem,</hi> not the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of <hi>Burning</hi> it self that is the evidence of a
true matter. I therefore told them that as it was
in the case of Signs<note n="1" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Interline "and"</hi> R. W. Ms. Ann.</note> Wonders <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. though
they be Signs which false <hi>Prophets</hi> give, which
come to pass, yet God commands his Children not
to be moved from his written word, and his holy
revealed and recorded <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Institutions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I told them that I had other places which I had
turned down in <hi>Edward Burrowes</hi> to produce; but
these I had suppressed in my thoughts for expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
sake, and would if they pleased pass on to my
proof of my next <hi>Position,</hi> to this they readily as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented:
but being now out of my Shackles of a
quarter of an hour (to which I wink'd to draw
them on) I crave the Readers Patience and leave to
hear me say something now which then I could
not say.</p>
            <p>178] First.<note place="margin">True Scripture Language.</note> To what I have said before of <hi>E.
Burrowes</hi> insisting so largly on the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of the
<hi>Quakers,</hi> and yet my <hi>Antagonists</hi> denying them to
make their Sufferings an <hi>Evidence</hi> of their <hi>Truth,</hi> I
present the Reader with a witness of <hi>G. Fox</hi> his
words in his <hi>Pag 64, [And there is a Proof to thee
that the</hi> Quakers <hi>are sent of God who speak to thee of
the Scripture right as they are]</hi> He that reads the
place shall see that <hi>G. Fox</hi> useth these words against
his Opposite <hi>Ieremiah Iewes,</hi> because that his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:43125:141"/>
had said, viz. That the <hi>Word of God</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the <hi>Scripture:</hi> and <hi>G. Fox</hi> checks him for
it and saith if he had said [the word which it speaks
of] he had spoken right <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this <hi>G. Fox</hi>
makes an <hi>Evidence</hi> of the <hi>Quakers</hi> being sent of
God, that they only can speak <hi>properly.</hi> How
much more is what I have produced (and have
much more to produce) a <hi>Proof</hi> that they do roll
their Souls upon their <hi>Sufferings</hi> as an <hi>Evidence</hi> and
Confirmation that they are sent of God?</p>
            <p>2. It is wonderfull what the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi>
have suffered for their <hi>Lyes</hi> and <hi>Blasphemyes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull Sufferings of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</note> What
a wonderfull Story doth <hi>Manasseh Ben-Isrel</hi> relate
of a Noble man, a <hi>Portugal,</hi> turned <hi>Iew,</hi> burn'd
in <hi>Portugal</hi> for the <hi>Iewish Faith?</hi> What <hi>Devotion</hi>
and <hi>Zeal</hi> have many of the <hi>Popish</hi> Party shewn at
<hi>Tiburn?</hi> Sure it is that a natural <hi>Valour</hi> and <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity,</hi>
a natural <hi>Melancholy</hi> and <hi>Stoutness,</hi> a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Vain-Glory</hi> will give wings which fire
and Burning cannot scorch and conquer.</p>
            <p>3. I doubt not but that tis possible for not only
<hi>Christians,</hi> but also <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> &amp;c. like <hi>Paul</hi>
in his mad <hi>Conscience,</hi> to be zealous for his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
and to put others to death for their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,</hi>
and yet neither of them to sin against their
<hi>Consciences,</hi> but ignorantly as <hi>Paul</hi> did.</p>
            <p>4. I believe that not only <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Great fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in this life.</note> and such as he,
in Unbelief may so practice, but even the true
Saints and Children of God. He that shall ponder
the Fathers <hi>Poligamy,</hi> the best Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
the <hi>High places, Davids</hi> slaying <hi>Uriah, Asahs</hi>
imprisoning the <hi>Prophet, Peters</hi> rash using the Sword,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:43125:142"/>
               <hi>Davids</hi> and <hi>Nathans</hi> unadvised <hi>Advise</hi> to build God
a Temple, the <hi>Disciples</hi> calling for Fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and shall see cause to reprove the <hi>Quakers</hi> for
their rash damning of others from whome they
have suffered. For,</p>
            <p>5. As tis possible for Gods own Children to hold,
and that [179] obstinately, false <hi>Principles,</hi> so it is
possible for other of Gods Children as obstinately
to afflict and punish those others to <hi>Death,</hi> and so
bring <hi>Affliction</hi> and <hi>Destruction</hi> one upon an other
which is that the Devil aimes at.</p>
            <p>6. Because the <hi>Quakers</hi> do so abundantly glory
in their <hi>Sufferers,</hi> and (in comparison of them)
slight the <hi>Saints</hi> under the <hi>Altar</hi> (in our <hi>Book of
Martyrs,</hi> as <hi>Iames Parnel</hi> impiously calls it) casting
all that differ from them into the <hi>Satanical Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
and <hi>Serpentine nature,</hi> as <hi>Fox</hi> doth, <hi>Pag. 5. and</hi>
253. and 99. Who forbids to receive into their
Houses, no not Kings and Princes, nor to bid them
<hi>God speed</hi> that are not in their Light.<note place="margin">True and False Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers for the Name of Christ.</note> I think it
fit to observe at this Turn some Differences between
true <hi>Sufferers</hi> and false, both pretending the Name

            </p>
            <p>First, The Persons whome the heavenly man
<hi>Iohn Fox</hi> describes, they were men and women
known to be of holy and heavenly Spirits towards
God, and of low and meek Spirits towards all, yea
their very enemyes. I would I could say so of the
<hi>Quakers</hi> (though no question but a <hi>a gold Ring</hi> may

I have cause to fear that generally they are

            </p>
            <p>The Cause of <hi>Iohn Foxes</hi> and <hi>G. Foxes</hi> Martyrs
differ as much as Day from Night, and Light from
Darkness: For it is known that <hi>I. Fox</hi> his <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi>
or <hi>Witnesses</hi> (those blessed Souls under the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar)
were slain for maintaining the Authority and

            <p>But <hi>G. Foxes Sufferers</hi> have generally suffered for

respect of Gods holy Truth) it was couragious and
gallant, yet their lowliness and humility did shine
forth gloriously also.</p>
            <p>1. As to God, being more sensible of their sins

their former peace and liberties, by their drowsiness
and sleeping upon the Earthen bed of worldly

            <p>Contrarily it is known to all, that although some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the <hi>Quakers</hi> will say we come in love to your

stark nakedness of men and women, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. As to Revenge, how patient, and pitiful, and

When the Devil is a <hi>Fisher</hi> longing for troubled and

many of the bloody prophesies of his waspish Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets

and false already.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We now descended to the thirteenth Proposal

            <p>I told them that I had not shun'd (as in the
presence of the most High) to read any of their
Books or Letters I could come at: but the truth is,
I could never pick out any Wheat (of solid, rational
and heavenly Truth) out of their heaps of Chaffe,
and Dreams, and Fancies of new Christs, new
Spirits, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is true that <hi>W. Edmund.</hi> said, that the Word
of the Lord [182] was a Fire, and a Hammer, &amp;c.
But I said the word they meant was but a painted
Fire, and a painted Hammer, and that never broke
nor burned up sin as sin.</p>

            <p>But in the <hi>Quakers Books &amp; Writings, Peter &amp;
Iude</hi> tells us (what I have found) clouds high of an

            <p>Let <hi>Io. Chandlers</hi> Writings, and the Writings of

have made it good to <hi>G. Fox</hi> himself, and to all
Christians, how poor and lame, and naked <hi>G. Fox</hi>
his writings are, who seems to be as <hi>Pighius</hi> and
<hi>Echius</hi> amongst the <hi>Papists,</hi> and as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the

And though he upbraids all his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites
scornfully and ridiculously (as poor Children
that know not the Bible nor their Accidence in

saith, <hi>[You where you are sees him nor]</hi> where it

            <p>2. I observe throughout his Book a Devillish

            <p>
               <hi>G. Fox</hi> gives a shrewd suspition that he never knew

known: of others of them I have smelt the <hi>sweet

            <p>But as <hi>G. Fox</hi> will be found to adore an <hi>Image

            </p>
            <p>3. In this Book of <hi>G. Fox</hi> (all along) he denies
the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be the Word of God: and he said,
that every man in the world hath that Spirit that
gave forth <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and that all Saints are [185

the Prophets and Apostles and holy Pen-men of
the holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> all tending to <hi>vilifie</hi> and <hi>nullifie</hi>
the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, his <hi>Impiety</hi> in these Assertions (which

               <hi>&amp; Iewes, &amp; Papists, &amp;

though he be crafty is but a Beast still) For out of
his <hi>Piety</hi> he grants the holy Scriptures through all
his Book to be the <hi>Words of God,</hi> though not the
<hi>Word of God:</hi> and for this his Grant he quotes
<hi>Exod. 20. God spake all these Words,</hi> and the four
Books of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> which I nor my Opposites
could tell in publick what to make of: But if they
are the <hi>Words</hi> of God, and fome of them fearfully
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:43125:147"/>
written by the inconceivable Finger of God once
and twice, then every particular <hi>word</hi> of these <hi>words</hi>
must needs be the <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Will</hi> or mind <hi>of God</hi>
every grain of gold is gold, and every drop in the
Ocean is Water and Salt too, as I urged to them
before concerning every word that proceedeth out
of the mouth of God) else the <hi>Words of God</hi> when
brought to particular examination, they are not the
word of <hi>God,</hi> but of <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Devills.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How sweet are (not Words but) right Words:
every man shall kiss his lips that gives a right An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
how dirty then, how filthy and bloudy are
those Lips that in so many places, debating with so
many wise and learned and pious men, drop not
<hi>Honey</hi> and <hi>Milk,</hi> but <hi>Wormwood</hi> and <hi>Gall</hi> the <hi>Venome</hi>
and the <hi>Poyson</hi> of Asps to them that lick up such
deceitfull and destroying <hi>Doctrines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. In <hi>G. Fox</hi> his Book I observe that all along
he notoriously nibbles ar <hi>VVords</hi> and quarrels at
<hi>VVords,</hi> which he saith are not <hi>Scripture,</hi> as that
wicked word <hi>[Humane]</hi> relating to the Person of the
Son of God and man.</p>
            <p>Also the word <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Sacrament.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The word Humane abominable above all words to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</note> Oh how

the words <hi>Baptisme</hi> and <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> which are

which are Latine words. That word <hi>Humane</hi> is
odious <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> sake, and therefore the

            </p>
            <p>5. I observe the loose and wild Spirit of <hi>G. Fox</hi>
in dealing with so many heavenly <hi>Champions,</hi> the
Leaps and Skips like a wild <hi>Satyre</hi> or <hi>Indian,</hi> catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and snapping at here and there a Sentence, like
Children skipping ore hard places and Chapters,

Books,<note place="margin">The simple tautologyes of the Quakers.</note> and in <hi>G. Fox</hi> his Book such <hi>Tautologies</hi> and

9. All may see what a simple <hi>Craking</hi> Sound of

Goliah</hi> and his <hi>Philistines, Rabshekah</hi> and his <hi>Assiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>

            <p>10. For a more full proof of the <hi>Lameness</hi> and
<hi>Stark nakedness</hi> of their Writings, I shall select and
mention some <hi>Particulars</hi> out of this <hi>Grand Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
of <hi>G. Fox</hi> 1. His Opposites Words, then his
Answer. And, 3. My Replyes <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page 1. He brings in</hi> Sam. Eaton <hi>saying,</hi> [He
doth not believe that there is Substantial, Essential or

the Saints had not Union with God which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
say they have.]</p>
            <p>I Reply: concerning the <hi>Essence</hi> or <hi>Being</hi> of the
Immortal, Invisible, Infinite, Eternal, Omnipotent,
and Omniscient, and only Wise: we know no more
then a Fly knows what a King is, and therefore 1

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:43125:150"/>
to:</hi> how fully doth the Holy Spirit in the
Book of <hi>Iob,</hi> and especially in that dreadful Word
or Voice of God in a <hi>Whirlwind</hi> knock out the
brains of all these proud Fancies? let this proud
<hi>Fox,</hi> or any of the stoutest <hi>Lions or Lionesses</hi>
amongst them, look but a few minutes upon the
glorious Sun in the Heavens, and then tell us how
their eyes do: and yet thus like proud and prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Children do they make a noise about their
<hi>Bibs,</hi> and <hi>Aprons,</hi> and <hi>Muckingers:</hi> and how they
are one with God his <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Essence,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Is it not enough for Sun,<note place="margin">Gods being out of our reach</note> Moon and Stars, and
Men to be enlightned by his Infinity, but they
must be God himself, and Light it self, in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
sence, because God is Light, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>What impudence would it be in a Wife, because
she is one with her Husband in Relation, to say,
She is the Husband himself, and not to keep her
just distinction and distance? or in a Subject (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Subjects and the <hi>King</hi> are Relatives, and
in a sence one) [189] therefore to say, that they are
the <hi>King himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, we know that the word <hi>Spirit</hi> is taken in
<hi>Holy Scripture</hi> for a <hi>Spiritual Nature.</hi> Hence it is
said that God is a Spirit, not that God is properly
a Spirit, no more then he is Light (though my
Opposites in our Dispute affirmed he was) but of
such a Heavenly and Spiritual Nature:<note place="margin">The nature of Spirits</note> For the
Devils also are Spirits, though defiled with sin and
wickedness: thus <hi>Ioh. 3. That which is born of the
Spirit is Spirit,</hi> not that Spirits beget Spirits, and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:43125:151"/>
that a new Creature is a young holy Spirit or God
himself, as I told one of the chief of the <hi>Quakers</hi>
at <hi>Newport,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. shews us in what respect he
that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit: For know
you not (saith <hi>Paul) that your Bodies are the Temples
of the Holy Spirit:</hi>
               <note place="margin">How God and Christ of is in us.</note> and <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. For an Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God through the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Thus God dwelt in his Temple of old, as a Man
in his House and a King in his Palace: not that a
Mans House, or the Kings Palace is of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
or Essence no more then an house is of the
Suns Essence, &amp;c. and no more was Gods Temple
of old, nor his Temples his Saints now, after the
blockish and blasphemous nonsence of the <hi>Quaker.</hi>

            <p>I Reply, as the Sun in the Heavens is the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy
or Center of all Natural Light, though some
eyes are sore, look a squint, or are stark blinde.</p>
            <p>And as the Rule or Canon (though <hi>Fox</hi> simply

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> True, but will he say these seven things:</p>
            <p>1. That all the pretended <hi>Revelations</hi> are the

               <hi>Teachings</hi> (as Children and Mad Folks do) without
chewing, and rational weighing &amp; consideration.</p>
            <p>4. That God hath not appointed his old Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

as a <hi>Standard, Rule</hi> or <hi>Touch stone</hi> to try all our own
and others Inspirations by?</p>
            <p>5. That <hi>Mahomets Inspirations</hi> are not one of
the most prevailing Snares, Traps, and Engines,
whereby he hath catcht whole Nations and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and the greatest part of this poor world at

            <p>6. That when God reveals his word or will in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

and they are slighted) it is not common and most
righteous with God to deliver up proud lazy Souls

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:43125:154"/>
the wonderfull effect of it to him that believeth

beast called a <hi>Fox,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Three Foxes.</note> a subtle and pernicious creature:
there was a famous heavenly Man, a famous writer

poor deluded &amp; deluding Soul <hi>G. Fox,</hi> to whome I
am now replying, ought not these to be <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished?</hi>
Is there not such a mischievous subtle

it) the <hi>wild Beasts</hi> name: or was not such a <hi>learned

it is that we read so often of <hi>Preaching the Gospel,</hi>
of <hi>Believing the Gospel,</hi> and that as before <hi>Paul</hi> calls
it his <hi>Glad news,</hi> or <hi>Gospel</hi> because it was his work
to tell it.</p>
            <p>Yea but saith this Deceiver throughout his Book
<hi>A man may have the Letter and Form, without the
Power and Life. &amp;c.</hi> I Answer Who knows not
that? and that a <hi>Form &amp; picture</hi> is not the man
himself? who knows not that <hi>Iudas</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

preacheth an immaginary and <hi>Allegorical Christ,</hi>
in order to establish himself the only true Christ,
and the <hi>Eternal Son of God</hi> as many bewitched
Souls call him. 9. What is this but to cheat poor

            <p>10. The truth is (search your cheating <hi>Familiars</hi>

to thrust the Eternal God out, for there can
be but one in the Throne of the Godhead: But
we are commanded to labour to be like unto God
who not only is kinde to his Friends but his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
also: As when we are bid to be like the <hi>Sun</hi>
to shine upon the Bad as well as the Good: will a
sober Soul imagine that we are bid to be as <hi>Pure,</hi>

which the Husbandman and Gardiner allows not,<note place="margin">The estate of Gods Children upon Earth</note>
nor endures not a Weed but with grief and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of their extirpation. 4. And this is far from
being Proctors and Advocates for sin (as <hi>G. Fox</hi>
most simply and impudently urgeth) for the known
truth is, that <hi>Fox</hi> and his <hi>Foxians</hi> fall most foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and fiercely upon such as profess most holiness,
most sincerity, and most Mortification, most love
to God, and his only begotten the Spirit of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

            <p>
               <hi>A ninth Instance is in page 28. where G. Fox.
tells how the same Author preached an external
word</hi> [Which the Scripture speaks not of,<note place="margin">Richard Baxter</note> but of the
word that lives, abides and endures for ever, and of
the Scriptures of Truth that cannot be broken: and of
Gods words and Christs words, and that is not exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal:
this is not agreeable to sound words that cannot
be condemned: but that is like his Doctrine that knows
not the Eternal: but the Ministers of Christ did not
tell of an external word, but you being made by the will
of man speaks to the People of an external word.]</p>
            <p>I Reply, The word (whether external, internal,
or eternal) is a [199] similitude, for we know God
hath no Mouth, nor Tongue, nor Words as we
have: but as Kings, and Generals of Armies or
Navies, or any Commanders in chief signifie their
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:43125:159"/>
minds by Speech, by Writing, yea by sign (at a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance)
this Word or will, which was before in the
Kings breast, and internal is now outward or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.
Hence Christ Jesus above all other wayes
of Gods manifesting himself externally or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
is called the Word of God, and the Word
which was God. Hence in common speech we
call our Thoughts our selves <hi>[So I think, &amp;c. this is
my Word, my Vote, or Mind.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as it is the Field: If a General himself who
first gave the external Word from his own internal
Thoughts:<note place="margin">The great consequence of a word</note> if he forget the word in the night a
common Sentinel will make him stand, or fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him: and shall men be so careful in these tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory
businesses, and shall we suffer open Enemies
to the true Lord Jesus presumptuously to pass with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the external word or mind of God, and auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
to deny such a word at all to be? When
Christ Jesus <hi>Luke</hi> 4 spake out of the <hi>Prophet Isaiah:</hi>
and when <hi>Paul</hi> disputed three Sabbath dayes out of
the Scriptures, and when <hi>Apollos</hi> mightily convinced
the <hi>Iews</hi> from the Scriptures that Jesus was the
Christ, did they not use external, audible Expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Applyings of that written word or mind
of God as the external and outward manifestation
of his internal and eternal holy Pleasure.</p>

               <hi>A tenth Instance is in page</hi> 32.<note place="margin">Ellis Bradshaw</note> 
               <hi>where</hi> G. Fox
<hi>brings in</hi> Ellis Bradshaw <hi>saying</hi> [The Quakers Spirit

[That is a Lye: for it teacheth them to have all Men in

            <p>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:43125:159"/>
I Reply, I have spoken of their proud and lofty
behaviour toward all men, the <hi>Highest,</hi> the <hi>Eldest,</hi>
the <hi>Holyest,</hi> upon the <hi>10th. Position,</hi> of their Pride &amp;c.
and therefore briefly say, 1. That all men may see
how truely they honour and esteem all men in the
Lord, and what Lord and honour it is that they
mean: when G. F. his first word to his Opposite is
in that most provoking Term, <hi>viz. [That is a Lye]</hi>
in his very pleading and the very first words of it.<note place="margin">The honor which the Quakers give to others</note>
It is true Christ Jesus and his Servants the Prophets
and Apostles used sharp and bitter <hi>Reproofs, Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes</hi>
&amp;c. but thus suddenly at the first dash to
give fire <hi>Thou Lyest, That is a Lye</hi> &amp;c. It shews nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Religion</hi> nor <hi>Civility</hi> but a <hi>Barbarous Spirit,</hi> for
they that know the <hi>Barbarians</hi> know how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
that word is in all their mouths. Tis true of
late divers of <hi>Fox</hi> his followers have followed him
in courtesie [200] looking toward you, taking you
by the hand, bowing and half uncovering the head
more or less <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is but a <hi>Revolt</hi> and <hi>Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacy</hi>
from their first <hi>Rigid Spirit</hi> and <hi>Cariage</hi> as <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey
Norton</hi> rightly maintains against them. Yea.
2. it is against all <hi>Foxes</hi> and their first Writings,
and this very place of <hi>Iames</hi> here urged, <hi>viz.</hi> they
are convinced by the Law if they respect mens
Persons.</p>
            <p>Again, tis true in Christ Jesus there is neither
Bond nor Free, Male nor Female, and consequently
no Master no Man, no Father no Child no King
no Subject, but all are one in Christ Jesus, and the
second Birth: as all are of one kinde in the <hi>first
Adam,</hi> and the <hi>first Birth.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:43125:160"/>
1. Yet first how full is the Holy Scripture of
Commands and Examples of Gods Children,<note place="margin">Civil respect</note> giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
respective Words and Titles, and Bowings, even
to persons that knew not God? 2. <hi>Fox</hi> grants dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of gifts, and saith that some (in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of others of them not so grown, &amp;c. are Elders,
&amp; sure this is some respect of persons, according to
that of the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Are all <hi>Apostles,</hi> are all <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
are all <hi>Teachers,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore how ever
they Hypocritically lye, and pretend to honour all
men in the Lord: yet the most Holy and only
Wise knows how proudly, and simply, and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
they have run into uncivil and inhumane
Behaviours towards all their Superiours, the eldest
and highest, how that they have declared by prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
and practice, that there are no Men to be
respected in the World but themselves as being
Gods and Christs. Tis true our <hi>English Bibles</hi> and
<hi>Grammar</hi> (as <hi>Fox</hi> his great Learning often objects)
makes thou to a single person, and Thou in Holy
Scripture is used in a grave and respective way unto
Superiours, unto Kings, and Parents, and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
But 1. (As I have said) the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and the
<hi>Greek</hi> signifie no more Thou then You, and so may
be truely turned.<note place="margin">Thou &amp; Thee</note> 2. Every Nation, every <hi>Shire,</hi>
every <hi>Calling</hi> have their particular <hi>Properties</hi> or
<hi>Idioms</hi> Speech, which are improper and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
with others: Hence these simple Reformers
are extreamly ridiculous in giving Thou and Thee
to every body, which our Nation commonly gives
to <hi>Familiars</hi> only; and they are extreamly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferably
proud and contemptuous unto all their <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours</hi>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:43125:160"/>
in using Thou to every body which our
<hi>English Ideom</hi> or propriety of speech useth in way
of familiarity or of Anger,<note place="margin">Incivilities ought to be moderately
punisht</note> Scorn and Contempt.
I have therefore publickly declared my self, that a
due and moderate restraint and punishing of these
incivilities (though pretending Conscience) is as far
from Persecution (properly so called) as that it is a
Duty and Command of God unto all mankinde,
first in Families, and thence into all mankinde
Societies.</p>
            <p>201] Having thus through Gods mercifull help
gone through the <hi>13th Position</hi> in publick and this

out of <hi>G. Fox</hi> his <hi>Writings.</hi> I hasten to the 14
<hi>Proposition,</hi> the last of the seven at <hi>Providence.</hi>
They read it publickly, viz. <hi>the spirit of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers

hath been, or can be practised by any</hi> Hunters <hi>or</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors
<hi>in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I told them I could adde more Branches to this
<hi>Head,</hi> as unto the peace and civil Societyes of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in the world: but I remembred my promise
of <hi>Brevity,</hi> and <hi>W. E.</hi> was often remembring me
sayinge <hi>Is this thy Quarter of an hour?</hi> for I believe
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:43125:161"/>
they stood here upon <hi>Coals</hi> and were not willing
that I should insist upon it my full <hi>Quarter;</hi> and
they hasted me on to prove that their <hi>spirit</hi> tended
to <hi>Barbarisme:</hi> they said (one and an other) that
their <hi>spirit</hi> was an <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">W E. &amp;c <hi>standing upon coals.</hi>

            <p>I told them that in our <hi>Native Countrey,</hi> and in

Courteous Salutation, and respective Behaviour was

               <note place="margin">Civility and Courtesie.</note> This I said was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such a Spirit was Christ Jesus of, even to his

them pass by their <hi>Familiars,</hi> their <hi>Kindred,</hi> [202

and therefore I said, 2. <hi>G. Fox</hi> in his book
affirms that the <hi>Conversation</hi> of these very <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
in many things were better then his <hi>Opposites</hi>
&amp;c. I mused in my self (being much acquainted
with the <hi>Natives</hi>) what <hi>G. Fox</hi> should mean, he not
having been in <hi>N. England</hi> when he wrote that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage;
but since I have heard that the <hi>Quakers</hi> have
commended the spirit of the <hi>Indians,</hi> for they have
seen them come into <hi>English Houses</hi> and sit down
by the fire,<note place="margin">The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and Quakers of one Spirit.</note> not speaking a word to any body: But
this cariage of the <hi>Indians</hi> proceeds from a <hi>bruitish
spirit,</hi> for generally they have boldly come in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Knocking</hi> or asking of leave, and sit down with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any respect in word or gesture to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
or chief of the Family whosoever (just the
<hi>Quakers</hi> general fashion and Spirit)</p>
            <p>Further I told them, that in some respect the
spirit and cariage of the <hi>Quakers</hi> was worse then
that of the <hi>Indians,</hi> for if they were sd by the
<hi>English</hi> in the <hi>high-way</hi> or coming into an <hi>House,</hi>
they are very ready to receive your <hi>Salutation</hi> kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and return you another: But commonly we
know that it is not so with the <hi>Quakers bruitish spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
2. The <hi>Indians</hi> morning and evening, and
upon all meetings, they give a respective and
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:43125:162"/>
proper <hi>Salutation</hi> to their own <hi>Superiours,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in gesture as well as speech. 3. Although
the <hi>Indians</hi> are <hi>bruits</hi> in their <hi>Nakedness</hi> both men
and women, yet they never appear (no not in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
houses) <hi>stark naked</hi> as the <hi>Quaker men</hi> and
<hi>women</hi> doe: yea they so abhor such a <hi>bruitishness,</hi>
(except it be in their mad <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> for then
they will be <hi>stark naked</hi>) that as to their <hi>Female
kind,</hi> they will carefully from their birth keep on
some modest covering before them. <hi>W. E.</hi> rose up
and said they did abhor <hi>Uncleaness</hi> as well as our
selves or any, their women were sober, holy and
Modest, and would not endure (some of them) to
have a Toe to be seen naked: but he said if the
Lord God did stir up any of his <hi>Daughters</hi> to be a Sign
of the <hi>nakedness</hi> of others he believed it to be a
great Cross to a Modest womans Spirit,<note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers again maintain their womens Nakedness.</note> but the
Lord must be obeyed. <hi>Iohn Stubs</hi> immediately
seconded him, and quoted again the Command to
<hi>Isaiah, Chap.</hi> 20. to go naked, &amp; he added, whereas
I said at <hi>Newport</hi> that it was in the time of <hi>Signs,
Types, Figures &amp;c.</hi> He would now prove that all
<hi>Signs</hi> were not abolished by the coming of Christ;
for <hi>Agabus Act.</hi> 20. took <hi>Pauls</hi> [203] <hi>girdle</hi> and
bound himself. I replyed that was indeed one of
my Replyes at <hi>Newport,</hi> and I was yet far from
binding the <hi>sweet Influences</hi> of the holy One by
<hi>Dreams, Visions, immediate Impulses Revelations,
Signs</hi> &amp;c. but withall I said that before the coming
of the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> and at his coming was the time
and season of such <hi>Appearances</hi> from God:<note place="margin">Signs and Figures discussed.</note> now he

and most wonderfull coming of his <hi>Son</hi> out of his

that <hi>(Ioh</hi> 20) We might believe in him, follow him

concern the <hi>monstrous</hi> stripping their <hi>women naked,</hi>

               <note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers spirit tending to Arbetrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> I told them the

            <p>
               <hi>That the Spirit of the Quakers tendeth to bring in
an Arbetrary Government.</hi> I said we all knew how
it had cost the blood of <hi>thousands</hi> &amp; <hi>ten Thousands</hi>
this matter of <hi>Goverment &amp; Lawes:</hi> that the Most
High &amp; only Wise choosing one <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Nation
of Israel</hi> to be his own, he wrote them Laws (some
with his own inconceivable <hi>finger</hi> written) and some
by <hi>Moses</hi> his inspired <hi>Pen-man,</hi> it pleased him not
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:43125:163"/>
to leave their <hi>Wisest</hi> and <hi>Holyest Kings &amp; Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi>
without written known Lawes, with <hi>Rewards</hi>
and <hi>Penaltyes</hi> annexed. But I argued if that were
true that all the <hi>Quakers</hi> were guided in all they
said and did by the immediate Spirit of God (as I
proved <hi>Fox</hi> maintained) then if they obtain higher
or lower Governours of their Spirits, Surely it
shines cleer that there is no need of Laws for them
to rule &amp; act by,<note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers have no need of Scripture much less of the written Laws of men</note> for they had no need of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and seing the <hi>Immediate Inspirations</hi> of God
would not suffer them to erre in Judgment, for as
they said of the holy Scripture, they had no need
of it, for they had the holy Scripture within them,
their Teacher within them, and all that they spake
was Scripture, and the voice of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So I said
much more [204] might it be said of Mens <hi>Laws &amp;
Writings;</hi> that surely they had no need of them: for
what could be more just and equal, more pure &amp;
holy in all Cases Controversies &amp; Businesses, then
the immediate <hi>Voice of God? W. E.</hi> said, what dost
thou fill peoples ears with strange <hi>Notions,</hi> as if the
People of God called <hi>Quakers</hi> were a lawless people
and would bring all Government and all Laws to
nothing? We are for righteous <hi>Goverment,</hi> and
righteous <hi>Lawes,</hi> we are not for any to rule by
<hi>Force,</hi> and more he spake to this purprse.</p>
            <p>I Replyed,<note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers &amp; none else in the World fit for Gonrn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as they judge</note> that he mistook me, by an <hi>Arbetrary
Goverment</hi> I did not intend a Goverment ruling by
<hi>Force</hi> (for there could be no Goverment in the
world without the <hi>Sword</hi>) but <hi>Arbitrary I</hi> said came
from <hi>Arbitrium</hi> which signified <hi>Will</hi> or pleasure:
and so my <hi>Argument</hi> was, that Persons immediately
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:43125:163"/>
speaking from God, it was impertinent and profane
to clog and cumber them with <hi>Lawes,</hi> for the
Voice of God (the <hi>Law</hi> of all <hi>Laws</hi>) proceeded
out of their mouth, then which there could be
none more Just, more Wise, more Holy.</p>
            <p>Here stood up an <hi>Aged man</hi> (and as able as most
in the company, <hi>T. A.</hi>) though much of late ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering

Replied, I charge them with no matter of Facts:
but I charge them and their Spirit with a tendency,

with an impulse was killing <hi>Isaak, Moses</hi> the
<hi>Egyptian, Ehud</hi> killing <hi>Eglon</hi> the King of <hi>Moab,

Sathan stir up his Instruments to pretend the like

            <p>My Antagonists joyntly bid me shew when any

not to the point, &amp;c. for I did not charge them to

his Son in imitation of <hi>Abraham,</hi> if his Sons cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, and the breaking open of the House had
not prevented: and that <hi>Iames Parnel</hi> moved by
this Spirit to Fast forty dayes, &amp;c. perished the
eleventh day, &amp;c. but perceiving more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
heats, and that <hi>W. Edm.</hi> charged me that I
had a false heart of mine own, and would measure
others by my bushel: I told them of the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
actings of <hi>Tho. Munster,</hi> and <hi>I. Becold,</hi> and <hi>Fifer

wonderful Man) he was stab'd to death by a Frier
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:43125:164"/>
pretending a Vision of Angels on Christmas night,
who commanded him from God to dispatch and
kill the King, which he most desperately effected.
<hi>W. Edm.</hi> interrupted me, and spake (to this effect)
why should we suffer this man thus to wrong the
innocent people of God? we will measure him
with his own Bushel: For thy Book declares thy
approving of the killing of the Kings Father, and
said where is the Book? At which word <hi>W. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
(a Fire-brand of <hi>Town,</hi> and <hi>Colony &amp; Country</hi>)
rose up, and carried a Book (which they said was
mine) to <hi>W. Edmundson:</hi>
               <note place="margin">W. Edm. &amp; W. Harris their mal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lice towards me</note> I perceived that <hi>W. Edm.</hi>
&amp; <hi>W. H.</hi> who was for any Religion, and a malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
mortal enemy to all good, had been a plotting:
and I said openly I knew what malicious bloody
counsel had been between <hi>W. Har.</hi> and themselves:
but they would finde themselves befooled, for there
was nothing in the matter but ridiculous malice:
for all of us knew that <hi>W. H.</hi> loved the <hi>Quakers</hi>
(whom now he fawn'd upon) no more then he did
the <hi>Baptists</hi> (whom he till now fawn'd on) but
would love any, as a Dog for his Bone, for Land,
which he had a long Suit for as was known to all
the Country and their cost. Hereupon Capt.
<hi>Green</hi> of <hi>Warwick</hi> (Magistrate) desired that such
matters might be forborn, and others spake to the
same purpose: and <hi>I, Stubs</hi> and others are said to
speak to <hi>W. Edm.</hi> to forbear, so that the Book was
laid aside and delivered again to that [206] malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

how easily the malicious Spirit of <hi>W. Edm.</hi>

had spoken more scornfully of the <hi>Quakers</hi> then <hi>W
Harris,</hi> now he extreamly, privately and publickly
fawns upon them, seeing them my Enemies, who
had ever been his Friend, and never his Enemy but
in his outragious practises against <hi>Town, &amp; Colony &amp;
Country.</hi> He was a Pretender in <hi>Old England,</hi> but
in <hi>New</hi> my experience hath told me, that he can
be one with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> yea <hi>Iesuits</hi> or <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
for his own worldly ends and advantage. He
is long known to have put <hi>Scorns &amp; Ieers</hi> upon the
eminent Inhabitants of Town and Country. He
hath been notorious for quarrelling, and challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and fighting, even when he pretended with
the <hi>Quakers</hi> against <hi>Carnal Weapons;</hi> so that there
stands upon Record in the Town-book of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
an Act of <hi>Disfranchisement</hi> upon him, for fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and shedding Blood in the street,<note place="margin">W H &amp; the Q the higher powers as they simply affirm</note> and for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
and allowing it (for ought I know) to this
day. Then he turns <hi>Generallist,</hi> and writes against
all <hi>Magist-ates, Laws, Courts, Charters, Prisons,
Rates,</hi> &amp;c. pretending himself and his Saints to be
the <hi>Higher Powers</hi> (as now the <hi>Quakers do</hi>) and in
publick writings he stir'd up the People (most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiously
and desperately threatning to begin with
the <hi>Massachusets</hi>) and to cry out <hi>no Lords,</hi> no <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:43125:165"/>
as is yet to be seen in his Writing: this cost
my self and the Colony much trouble. Then (as
the Wind favoured his ends) no man more cries up
Magistrates: then not finding that pretence, nor
the People called <hi>Baptists</hi> (in whom he confided)
serving his ends. He flies to <hi>Connecticut Colony</hi> (then
and still in great Contest with us) in hopes to attain
his gaping about Land from them, if they prevail
over us: to this end he in publick Speech and
Writing applauds <hi>Connecticut Charter</hi> and damns
ours, and his Royal Majesties favour also for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us favour (as to our Consciences) which he
largely endeavours by writing to prove the <hi>K. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi>
by Laws could not do. My self (being in place)
by Speech &amp; Writing opposed him, &amp; Mr. <hi>B. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold</hi>
then <hi>Governour,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Io. Clark Deputy
Governour,</hi> Capt. <hi>Cranstone</hi> and all the Magistrates,
he was Committed for speaking &amp; writing against
his Majesties <hi>Honour, Prerogative, &amp; Authority:</hi> He
207] lay some time in Prison until the <hi>General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,</hi>
where the <hi>Quaker</hi> (by his wicked, ungodly,
and disloyal plots) prevailing, he by their means
gets loose, and leaves open a door for any man to
challenge the Kings Majesty for being too Godly or
Christian, in being too favourable to the Souls of
his Subjects against his Laws, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I had thought to have declared thus much pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,<note place="margin">W Edm. his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and impudent zeal and upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</note>
and how seasonably the Kings <hi>Declaration</hi>

troubled with him, &amp;c. and fined him, &amp;c. but now
my <hi>Lord Edmundson</hi> grew hot, and told me that I
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:43125:166"/>
had charged the People of the Lord with many
great and grievous Charges, which he said I could
not prove, yea, he said he would speak it before
the Lord, I had not proved one of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he warned me, being an old Man, that I
should not carry such a <hi>Burden</hi> on my back to my

he heard I had been a Magistrate, and said I was a
fit man to be a Magistrate that would so wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
charge the Innocent. <hi>Io. Stubs</hi> spake to the

that <hi>Roger Williams</hi> himself had not done it:
I saw God in their <hi>Confession.</hi>

            <p>I Reply, 1. I cannot learn that they litterally
hold, that they know all things knowable as God
(though G. <hi>Fox</hi> writes that they know all things as
God (yet I can not think them so gross as to imagine
that they know all things, past<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> present, and to

they must come to some figurative meaning, as

<hi>Paul</hi> writes, <hi>Phil. 4. I can do all things:</hi> I know
they say, they are one with God and Christ, and
they know all things, and can do all things; and
yet this sense which litterally is so Proud and Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous,
must be made out by a meaning and by
a figure (which they cry out against in others.)</p>
            <p>3. Therefore doth not the Spirit of God in <hi>Prov.</hi>
28.<note place="margin">About knowing all things.</note> open this to us, saying, <hi>Evil men understand not

            </p>
            <p>I Reply in these Considerations presented to the

with mankind.<note place="margin">The two great Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains of God with mankind.</note> 1. that of Justice and due

This <hi>Bargain</hi> was made with our <hi>first Parents:</hi>
and with all mankind to this day, yea, even with

            <p>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:43125:173"/>
3. It is one thing for God to offer this Covenant
or <hi>Bargain,</hi> [wherever the sound of this Gospel or
glad News comes] and another thing to embrace
and receive it as all the Elect of God do, and
another thing to work <hi>freely</hi> and give <hi>freely</hi> the
<hi>Means</hi> and Power to fulfil this <hi>Covenant:</hi> as God
doth by the <hi>Merits</hi> of his S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

working</hi> of <hi>Repentance</hi> and belief in the hearts
of all his Chosen.</p>
            <p>4. It is Common with the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> to speak
<hi>Figuratively</hi> in the <hi>holy Scripture.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Scripture language</note> To call the Sign
the thing <hi>signified,</hi> and the <hi>Instrument</hi> or <hi>Means,</hi> the
<hi>work done.</hi> Thus the <hi>Lamb</hi> is the <hi>Passover,</hi> the
<hi>Bread</hi> is <hi>Christs body,</hi> the <hi>Cup</hi> is his <hi>Blood:</hi> God and
<hi>Christ</hi> is called the <hi>Hope</hi> of his <hi>people,</hi> and <hi>Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
the <hi>Mediator</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> called the Covenant
it self. The King pardons Rebels for his Sons sake,
his Son may in a Sense be said [8] [though not <hi>liter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally]</hi>
to be the <hi>pardon</hi> it self: A man drives a <hi>Bargain</hi>
between two Chapmen that are absent and distant
drives on a <hi>marriage</hi> between a Man and a Woman
absent each from other, and may in a Figurative Sense
be called the <hi>Bargain</hi> or <hi>Covenant,</hi> and yet not <hi>literally</hi>
and <hi>properly</hi> as the poor <hi>Quakers</hi> would their <hi>Christ</hi>
to be.</p>
            <p>5 The grace and mercy of God,<note place="margin">God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the Gospel divers wayes</note> the Gospel or

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:43125:173"/>
mercy,</hi> and the rest he justly hardeneth that
God may be <hi>All in All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For as God walketh in the midst of his (most

               <note place="margin">Two Feet and 2 Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of God</note> with his two feet of Mercy

and is not the Covenant to any but his Chosen all

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That his Opposites throw out God, if
they make the Scripture the means of Faith.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, <hi>He slights the Novelty of it, saying,</hi>
There was Faith before there was Scripture.</p>
            <p>I reply, I have had many Occasions to speak of
the Scriptures already, I shall therefore briefly say,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:43125:174"/>
it is wonderful what an aking Tooth against the
Holy Writings of God: The old Serpent and all
the <hi>Wolves</hi> and <hi>Foxes</hi> of this World have had, who

<hi>runs to the Picture, or Forms of these Forms, and

Life it is good as nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. But to come to worship, was there not a Form,

or manner of <hi>Circumsion,</hi> the <hi>Passover,</hi> the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,</hi>

against the <hi>Customariness,</hi> the Carelessness,
the pictures, and the meer [13] Formality of the

a shameless falshood is it that any of Gods Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
brought Gods people off from those <hi>heavenly

Common Sense, against all Forms, that is, wayes and

been bewitched by those Soul-witches yet generally

<hi>viz.</hi> their Religion is so easie, never coming
near the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>rotten Nature,</hi> but so wonderfully

            <p>9. As to the point of Separation: I pray Mr.

opposites who are yet (in their Judgement and

to hear me patiently four words.</p>
            <p>1. I pray them to remember what the word

my <hi>mother</hi> the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and my Brethren

            </p>

the <hi>Pharisees</hi> who by Laud and Sea sent abroad

with the glad news of a new Bargain or Covenant
of God with the Sons of men, <hi>viz.</hi> this second
sort; It pleased the God of Heaven [not to be

out wonderfully miraculously, yea, also with the

or Protestants questions the Immortality of it:
and of the Body also, in joy or Sorrow to Eternity.</p>
            <p>As for the Body the Quakers say when the Soul
is gone into God, yea, the Soul of <hi>Iudas</hi> as well as
the Soul of <hi>Peter</hi> as some of them say, and all of
them by Argument will be forced to say, the Body
returns to Earth and Rottenness, never more to be
raised, and no more then Bodies of the Beasts,
Birds and Fishes, (though we know who holds the
Bodies of Beasts, Birds and Fishes shall live again
as the Soul mortalists do) what is it then [21] that
G. <hi>Fox</hi> sputters out for Immortality, or a not dying
in this Life? If he speak of the Soul who denies
it? If of the Body he speaks a Beastly Contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the doleful Sense of all mankind, and their
own also, who die and rot as well as them.</p>
            <p>2. It is true, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. God only hath Immortality

1. hath brought Life and Immortality to Light
through the Gospel.</hi> But what is this but the joyful
Condition of the Souls &amp; Bodies of the godly?
their Souls and Bodies raised up with Jesus to a
Spiritual holy Life in this World, their Souls going
to Jesus, and their Bodies <hi>sleeping in Iesus,</hi> and the

            <p>1. As to the Creatures: For some of them must

               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:43125:184"/>
Some of them maintaind the Soul of man to be

that it was part of the <hi>Divine Essence,</hi> others that
it is created and infused by God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some that the

            <p>I Reply, G. <hi>Fox</hi> (to pass by his un-English Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence

I say G. <hi>Fox</hi> either ignorantly or willingly

Christ be the End of the Law and the Prophets, in
a true sense: or whether Christ was not more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
at his coming in the Flesh, then before in
the Prophecies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But, whether the written
word of the Prophets, of which <hi>Peter</hi> speaks and I
have spoke before be not a more sure word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and Comfort to us then any now to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
yea, then that Revelation which we have
upon that holy Testimony of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</p>
            <p>As it is with an Anchor strong enough to ride a
Ship in most weathers, yet some are as the Seamen
spake <hi>second</hi> and <hi>third Bowers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bebaiote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron Iogon a more sure Word.</note> and one the best and
Sheet Anchor: and as it is in Witnesses some speak
the Truth and Substance of the matter: and yet
others speak more plainly and fully, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So
speaks Gods Spirit in <hi>Peter</hi> of the Infinite Fulness

of the Prophecies of Scriptures, or the written

            </p>
            <p>Thus the God of Heaven most holy and only

his word, his works his word, his Providences of
mercy or Judgement, his Word, the Lord Jesus his
only begotten his word, his writings his Word; and
this in a way of Condescention to our Capacity,
seeing that all the World over Kings and Rulers,

will,<note place="margin">The Srip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or written Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</note>
and this as the Spring in Clocks and watches
turn about all other wheels and motions. Hence
it is, that if ancient Records and Deeds with Hands
and Seals be produced at the <hi>Bar</hi> of <hi>Trial,</hi> all
mouths are stopt at such Evidences. Thus the
Word of God in the mouths of the Prophets writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

            <p>I Reply, First, What is the Light of Nature, but
the Light in which every man comes into the
World with (as the <hi>Foxians</hi> speak) a Light differing
from that Light which Beasts,<note place="margin">The light of Nature discussed</note> wilde and tame, and

               </note> Supernatural, as that Light re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
from Heaven in the Holy Scriptures, and
infused into the Souls of Men by the Holy Spirit
or Power of God.</p>
            <p>2. What is the Light of Nature in Man, but
that Order which the most Glorious Former of all
things hath set (like Wheeles in Clocks or Watches)
a going in all his Creatures?</p>
            <p>Some have observed that in the Insensible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to which the most High hath only giving
Beings,<note place="margin">Male and Female</note> that there may be observed a Male and
Female amongst them.</p>
            <p>This is more observable in Vegetables or grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Creatures, as in Plants, Trees, Herbs, Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:43125:187"/>
More yet in Sensitives, as Birds, Beasts, Fishes.</p>
            <p>Most of all in Rationals: Men and Women,
whom the most High hath so wonderfully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished.</p>
            <p>It is true, that in Religious and Christian Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
there is no [26] respect of persons with God,
as of Man before the Woman: otherwise than to
order Natural and Civil.</p>
            <p>The Woman is Predestinated, is Called,<note place="margin">Men and Women compared</note> is Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
is Glorified, and wears that Golden Chain as
well as the Wisest and Strongest of Mankinde.</p>
            <p>And it is true, the Wisdome of God perfers some
Women before thousands of Men, in their being
born of Nobles, in excellent parts (as is observable
in the Lady <hi>Iane,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> &amp;c.) in some
special favour,<note place="margin">The kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God to women</note> as Christ Jesus first appearing to
<hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> and other Women, and sending
them to carry the first Tydings or Gospel of his
Resurrection to his Apostles: yea, in effusions or
powrings forth of an extraordinary measure of his
Spirit before Christs coming, as on <hi>Miriam, Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,
Anna, Huldah,</hi> &amp;c. and at his coming (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Ioels</hi> Prophesie) on his Daughters as well as
his Sons (so that as my opposites alledged to me in
publick: <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Evangelist</hi> had four Daughters
thus extraordinarily end<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wed) yet this favour of
God toward Women destroys not the order which
the God of Order or Nature hath set in those
Bounds, and Limits, and Distinctions between the
Male and Female, the Man and Woman: though
the Holy Scripture were silent, yet Reason and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
tell us, that the Woman is the weaker
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:43125:187"/>
Vessel,<note place="margin">Womens unfitness for manly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</note> that she is more fitted to keep and order the
House and Children, &amp;c. that the Lord hath given
a covering of longer Hair to Women as a sign or
teacher of covering Modesty and Bashfulness, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and Retiredness: and therefore not so fitted
for Manly Actions and Employments.</p>
            <p>Therefore because of <hi>Ioels</hi> Prophesie, or because
we must not limit or quench the Spirit, as G. <hi>Fox</hi>
saith, there is no ground in Gods ordinary course
of Nature to permit Women to pretend to be
Apostles or Messengers to the Nation, or Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Teachers in the Publick Assemblies.</p>
            <p>1. Because we finde no such Commission given
by Christ Jesus or any such Practice amongst the
first Believers.</p>
            <p>2. The Lord hath set (as Seamen speak) a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter
to such an unnatural boldness by express
Prohibitions,<note place="margin">And for being Preachers and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</note> with the Reasons and Grounds to the

us, that <hi>Paul</hi> was not a Man, nor <hi>Timothy</hi> a Man,
nor the Teachers Men, nor <hi>Corinth</hi> a City, but all
signifie Metaphorical and Mystical Business.</p>
            <p>3. Why may not Women much more be <hi>Lord

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>4. That Reason the Spirit gives to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
for the vailing of Women in publick Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:43125:188"/>
makes much more for their vailing and silence
in matters of <hi>Prophesying, Preaching</hi> and <hi>Praying,</hi>
viz. Because of the Angels: I know not any fair
and sober Exposition of this Scripture (except as
the blind <hi>Quakers</hi> who swallow down a fly &amp; Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
too) but that of the Heavenly Angels and Spirits
attending on and guarding the Assemblies of true
Christians, and rejoycing in the comliness, order
and beauty of their publick Administrations.</p>

the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and though these Women animated the
Seamen to fight, and Prophesied <hi>that not an hair of
their head should perish,</hi> yet they two were both slain,
as afterward came certain Tydings of the whole
matter.</p>
            <p>I own that it may please the Father of Spirits in

            <p>9. Hence (according to <hi>Foxes Opposite</hi>) all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind

God then the Lamb bears to a Lyon: but out of
Fear, as the old saying is, <hi>primos in Orbe Deos,</hi> &amp;c.
Fear made the first Gods. Hence the <hi>Philistins</hi>
sends the God of <hi>Israel</hi> a present and offering with

be of any worship or Religion, as most this day in
the world will be, yea, all and every Soul except to
whom (in and from the holy Scriptures) the holy

            <p>A 16th. Instance <hi>of</hi> Foxes <hi>lame writings, is</hi> pag.

[The Iustification and Redemption by obeying the Light
within, is the Mystery of Iniquity]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He Answers,</hi> [He that believeth is justified from all
things, and comes not into Condemnation: and he hath
the wietnss in himself: and that lets him see the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
the Saviour, the Light which walking in it he
is cleansed from all Sin, and so no Mystery of Iniquity
For the Mystery of Iniquity is out of the Light. None
sees Iustification and Redemption, but with the Light
within which comes from Christ who hath enlightened
him.]</p>

I Reply, This is subtle, but being examined it
will be a mystery of <hi>hellish Iniquity,</hi> and lighter
then vanity it self.</p>
            <p>For 1. He usually,<note place="margin">Babilonian Jugling, &amp; Egyptian canting</note> and here (as before I have
opened) confounds Justification and Light, and
Christ, and Faith, and obedience, (after his <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish
wont</hi>) all in a Juglers box within together:
So that the English of Faith is Christ, Obedience
is Christ, Justification is Christ, Light is Christ,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is true, sometimes it pleased Gods Spirit to
speak figuratively, and to [30] call Christ some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
our Justification, and sometimes a Curse for
us:<note place="margin">Christs Name horribly prophaned</note> Sometimes Sanctification, and sometimes Sin
for us: But it is a mystery or subtle trick of Hell
to call Faith Obedience, and Obedience to the
Light Justification and Redemption, and yet mean
Christ. So that <hi>Fox</hi> his words may be in plain
English thus rendred, <hi>[None sees Christ and Christ but
with the Christ within, which comes from Christ who
hath Christed him.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The true Sense, (as Mony) Answers all things,
but it is a <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> to darken any, much

            <p>2. It is another Gospel (or glad News) yet not

this is Contradiction to their general grant, <hi>viz</hi>

            <p>A <hi>17th. Inst.</hi> is in <hi>ag.</hi> 63. where <hi>G. Fox</hi> brings in

            <p>I Reply, <hi>First,</hi> it is a doleful Business to read and

vapourings and Crakings are but Cheatings from <hi>the
God of this World</hi> whose eyes being beat out by
Gods most righteous Sentence, he labours to keep
all in <hi>blindness,</hi> or to beat out the eyes of those
whom God hath truly enlightned.</p>
            <p>2. As I have said before, and I said truly, the
word <hi>Light</hi> is a <hi>Similitude</hi> from <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>darkness</hi>
though my Opposites in the dispute affirmed, that
God was Light in a <hi>proper</hi> and not <hi>figurative Sense,</hi>

G. <hi>Fox</hi> knows how the <hi>Papists</hi> get a world of

(as the <hi>Pope</hi> speaks of Christ) The <hi>Devils</hi> have
a more real Faith or Belief of these things and

Kingdome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Three Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> concerning God and the Soul, and Spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual
matters, according to the saying of Christ Jesus,
<hi>my Kingdome is not of this World,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. From the word <hi>Entos</hi> within you, or amongst
you, as certainly it was then amongst the <hi>Iews,</hi> and
in the midst of them in their <hi>Temple Streets</hi> and
<hi>Houses, Hearts</hi> and <hi>mouths</hi> by the most <hi>wonderful
speakings</hi> of the Lord Jesus, as never man spake
amongst them, and the <hi>wonderful power</hi> and <hi>gracious
works</hi> which never man wrought amongst them,
nor in the whole World beside</p>
            <p>3. The Kingdome of God, that is God and
Christ, and the Spirit were literally in the <hi>Pharisees,</hi>
and so Consequently in every hypocrite in the
World, and every wicked and prophane Sinner,
though they know it not, yea in all Creatures.</p>
            <p>But this is against a former, fair Exposition from
the Greek word <hi>Entos,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</note> which cannot be refused
(since so agreeing with the Truth) except Reasons

            </p>
            <p>2. The Spirit of God asks, <hi>what agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:43125:197"/>
Christ and Belial, Light and Darkness, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
&amp; unrighteousness?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is most Improperly and Impious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Objected, that <hi>the Light shines in darkness,</hi> &amp;c. I
have said,<note place="margin">The Light shining in darkness.</note> that it can not be in the same Subject or
part predominate, the mind, or will, or Affections:
but the Light is at the window, and the Eye, and the
knock at the door, (by all the wayes and means by
which God visits poor men) but the Eye, the door
is shut, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the man within is not only asleep,
but dead and rotten in <hi>Natures silthiness,</hi> and <hi>actual
Transgressions</hi> and <hi>Abominations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It is against all Colour of Reason to Imagine
that the Lord Jesus should tell the <hi>Iews,</hi> the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,</hi>
and the rest of his <hi>bloody Enemies,</hi> who some
weakly, some maliciously opposed his Kingdome,

that his <hi>grace</hi> was <hi>King</hi> within them, what ever
their Heart or Tongues said, or Hands hid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. It is notoriously contrary to what G. <hi>Fox,</hi> and
his so often [39] Clamour that the <hi>Kingdome of God

               </gap>ly, (having spoken of the
Soul before) That the Soul or Spirit of a Man
should be boundless or without limits, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
or ending, is a <hi>Blasphemous Monster</hi> begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of <hi>Hellish Pride</hi> the Father, and <hi>Hellish Ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>
the Mother: for Infinity and Infiniteness in
that sence can be no other but the Infinite and
Eternal Power and Godhead transcending the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
or Men or Angels to receive it or conceive
the nature of it.</p>
            <p>2. It is true in a secondary way <hi>(a posteriori</hi>) as
they say the Spirits of Angels and men are as a Lamp
lighted by the most high and In- [50] finite Maj<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esty
never to go out or be extinguished in joy or
sorrow, This Notion dazles the most sober and
steady Eye and Braine; but who can finde a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
or Clod of standing from whence to entertain a
thought of no Beginning; no created finite power
can reach to what Infinity is.</p>
            <p>3. We see the mighty Kings and Emperours,
their mighty Armies and Navies have Bounds as
the-roaring Waves of the Ocean have: the most
Glorious Sun and Heavenly Bodies have their limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Motions:<note place="margin">The changes of all things created and their Periods</note> the Dayes and Nights, the Summer and

Leaves and Grass of the whole World are all too
short to reach to the thought of one Minute of that
which properly is Gods only propriety, <hi>to wit,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity.</p>
            <p>4. Among all the Opinions of the Souls Being
and Rise, this of Infinity making it God himself,
commits two horrible Murthers:<note n="1" place="bottom">Add "in its tendency though not in effect." <hi>R. W. s. Ann.</hi>

            <p>And Secondly, The Infinite God himself.</p>
            <p>For the Soul of Man by such a world of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

               </gap>lf, there
would be no Infinity at all so stopt, so limited by
sins and sorrows.</p>
            <p>5. We use to say (hyperbollically) that such and
such a doing is Infinite Pride, but surely it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
and devilish lifting up of the mind of a poor
Earthen Pot, though never so high, so wise, so
learned, so holy to entertain thoughts of being the
Eternal and boundless Infinite power and Godhead.</p>
            <p>The blessed Lord proclaime his Infinite Power,
his Infinite Wisdome, his Infinite Greatness, and
Goodness, and Patience to poor sinners (as he did
unto <hi>Iob</hi> out of the Whirlwind) and then for all
<hi>Iobs</hi> Perfection and their own, (which so simply as
well as proudly they prate of) they will with <hi>Iob</hi>
see cause to abhor themselves in Dust and Ashes.</p>
            <p>6 Such is the inconceivable Infinity in God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the reach of all Creatures, that he is not
only Infinite but Infinity it self, [51] Eternity it

self, Omnipotency it self, Wisdome it self, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
it self, Justice it self in all their eminences and
perfections.</p>
            <p>7. Therefore notwithstanding most gracious and
most glorious Appearances to, and influences from
Infinity, upon poor finite Worms below, sure it is
not so sober a Language as that of Birds and Beasts,
who keep their Native Tongues and Tones: Only

very term of Swearing is used.</p>
            <p>2. As to <hi>Paul,</hi> if the attestation of the Name of

Man Swore in this World <hi>Paul did,</hi> saying to the

by <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> nor the <hi>Temple,</hi> nor their <hi>Head,</hi> nor
any <hi>Oath,</hi> to wit of such a Nature, and half a sober

could yield to give a Testmony in weighty Cases,

               <note place="margin">About true bearing.</note>
Have the <hi>Papists</hi> the <hi>Iews</hi> or any Idolaters

False Worshippers or Idolaters to try them when I
am convinced and satisfied already that they speak

either (as I believe) Worship a False God, or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the true and living God, in Wayes and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships

of the <hi>Quakers</hi> at <hi>Newport</hi> the last year, I queried
with them about the true Christ, and the true Spirit:
but I was stopt by a sudden Spirit of Prayer in a
Woman, and the unseasonable Spirit of Prayer in a
man, which forced me to stop, and occasioned me
to take this [65] way of offering an appointed and
solemn discourse and disputation with them.</p>
            <p>5. I ask, may any Soul out of Curiosity go to
hear a strange Preacher, in whom I have not Faith,
that he is sent from God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> especially, if there
be not a free liberty for my Queries and Objections,
and searchings as the <hi>Bereans</hi> did?</p>

            <p>4. I know some affirm that though the Pope
be Antichrist, yet that he that letted was not the
Roman Emperour until he was taken out of the
way,<note place="margin">Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him who letted Antichrists rising</note> but that he that letted was the Holy Spirit to

of <hi>Iohn</hi> when those gifts did most flourish, yet then
there were many Antichrists, and the gift of the
Holy Spirit did not hinder their rising; so that all
ages are full of false Teachers.</p>
            <p>5. What Ignorance doth this little <hi>Fox,</hi> yet
great <hi>Boaster</hi> discover in saying <hi>[Now are People

over all those Glorious Protestant Witnesses of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,

of them, God commanded that Heavenly <hi>I. Fox</hi> to
make Record of.</p>

            <p>He Answers, That which condemneth is Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous;
it condemns that which is not perfect, and
the Generation is Righteous and not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
            <p>I Reply, He Answers four things: First, that
which Condemns is righteous. Secondly, That
which is Righteous Condemns that which is not
perfect.<note place="margin">The hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible pride of the Foxians</note> Thirdly, That which is righteous is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
Fourthly, The Generation is Righteous (that

the Summe of his Answer is, <hi>Himself</hi> and
his <hi>Foxians</hi> are <hi>Gods,</hi> as <hi>pure,</hi> &amp; <hi>holy,</hi> as God is,

            <p>2. It is not true, that all that is not perfect (in

               <note place="margin">The word perfect in the greek and Heqrew</note> For 1. (as hath

to the <hi>proud Ignorance</hi> of these <hi>Cheators.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Generation of all Gods Children (in all

their weakness, folly, pride, and many Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
with <hi>true Quaking</hi> and <hi>brokenness,</hi> and <hi>bitter

Men and Devils be perfect, and though a poor
Child of God be born of God,<note place="margin">The Saints bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel and daily Combate</note> be past from <hi>Death</hi>

God doth all, and what God doth that is good,
therefore no Sin.</p>

which may be known of God is manifest in them,

in them was of the Spirit, <hi>who is the God of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits

            </p>
            <p>1 Reply, 1. With Amazement at the dreadful

            <p>2. It is clear, that (as in all Answers to the <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi>
of his <hi>Opposites</hi> which he picks out) that he
holds the Contrary to his <hi>Opposite,</hi> so here <hi>viz.</hi> That

<pb n="434" facs="tcp:43125:224"/>
               <hi>Rom. 1. Cor.</hi> 2. As to the first, I will not repeat
what I have before written as to the Nature of the

&amp; <hi>seven Horns, and seven Lamps,</hi> his <hi>Common work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
in all men! his <hi>special working</hi> in the Elect,

&amp;c. Nor will I repeat matters concerning
the power of Nature in the <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and all
mankinde: Only from this <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. I observe,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That</hi> the Eternal Power and Godhead <hi>cannot be

God.<note place="margin">Kom. 1. Discussed as to the Eternal Power and Godhead.</note>

            <p>6. Yet this sight of God which men and Devils

both which I shall select two or three Attributes
of the Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p>1. The State of Christianity, amongst many other
high Expressions in the Scripture, is here called <hi>the
Kingdome of Gods dear Son,</hi> which argues a distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
from all other Kingdomes, and a distinction
from his <hi>Saints,</hi> as a <hi>King</hi> is not his <hi>Subjects,</hi> nor

that there was no difference between that <hi>Blood</hi> and

the Image of the invisible God:<note place="margin">Christ the picture of God.</note> If this should res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the Godhead only, which is invisible, how
could Christ be a visible Picture of Invisibility? If
the Manhood only? is God a Man, and Man his

            </p>
            <p>The Truth is, as Christs Blood is but figuratively

            <p>1. In both these Languages, and divers other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
it signifies the will and pleasure of the Mind

            <p>2. In a <hi>Metaphor</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> it is attributed to
God, though he have no word properly, having no

he deals with us <hi>poor Infants</hi> and sucklings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It is another <hi>Metaphor</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> to say God
is the word for God is no more a word, then he is
a Man or a Spirit, or a Sun, or Shield, or a House,
or a Fountain, or a Shepard litterally <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For as a
word or Expression proceeds from the mind &amp;
thoughts within: so are the Thoughts and mind of
God declared many wayes, but chiefly by that man
Christ Jesus called the Word.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Inconceivable Godhead</hi> being pleased to

            <p>4. I was once asked by a <hi>poor Foxian,</hi> whether
God had any more words but one?</p>
            <p>I <hi>Answered,</hi> (and do now) that God hath a great
many words or Expressions of his mind and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
unto <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Angels:</hi> and so G. <hi>Fox,</hi> and all
the <hi>Foxians</hi> Confess the Scriptures to be the Words
of God, and therein Confess that all, and every word
of Scripture is a word of God.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, when God gives forth a word or
Command by <hi>Angels,</hi> by <hi>Men,</hi> and by other of his
<hi>Armies,</hi> (wherein his <hi>Infinite Power</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi>
daily appeareth) his word runneth very swiftly, as
we see when the word is given in a Kingdome,
<hi>Navy</hi> or <hi>Army,</hi> (as in <hi>Ahashueros</hi> his one hundred
and twenty seven Provinces: <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) He sends out his
word, that is, his mind or pleasure, and melteth
them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147.</p>
            <p>5. So that I Affirm,<note place="margin">Infinite millions of millions of Gods word.</note> that the <hi>two great Lights</hi>
of <hi>Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> and all the <hi>lesser Lights</hi>
the <hi>Stars</hi> are <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Preachings,</hi> and <hi>preachers of
God to us:</hi> Every wind and Cloud, and drop of
Rain and Hail, every Flake of Snow, every Leaf,
every Grass, every drop of water in the Ocean, and
Rivers, yea, every Grain of Corn, and Sand on the
Shore, is a Voice or word and witness of God

are but so many Voices or words of God,</hi> God speaks
once and twice, <hi>Job.</hi> 33. but man hears it not, in Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions,
in Dreams, in Health, and Sickness, in Ease, and
pain, in wants, in plenty, in dangers and Deliverances,
Crosses, Losses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. That the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is most full, <hi>viz.</hi> that God
spake by his Prophets (or Preachers, or declarers of
his will) divers wayes and divers times,<note place="margin">Gods Spirit in his word</note> 
               <hi>but now he
hath spoken by his Son: From the beginning of the
world,</hi> Luke 1. he hath spoken of the coming of
this Son <hi>by the mouths of all his Prophets even from
the beginning of the World.</hi> Therefore though God
have many Sons,<note place="margin">Christ the word of God</note> yet Christ Jesus (that man Christ
Jesus) among the many millions of [82] Sons is
stiled the only Begotten Son of God, the Head of
all the Elect, purchased to God out of every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by his Blood, &amp;c. so by the same excellency
and eminency (above all the manifestations and
appearances of God to the World) no word or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of God is comparable to that appearance
of God in Christ Jesus, and therefore called <hi>the
Word of God</hi> as the greatest appearance of the

            <p>8. Hence it follows, that these poor <hi>Foxians</hi> are
so much the more shameless and monstrous,<note place="margin">The shameless wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Quakers against the Scriptures &amp; Christ himself</note> not

            <p>6. What is there in G. <hi>Fox</hi> his wild Notion,
<hi>[Can that which brings Salvation be outward?</hi>] Against
all the Proofs before I mentioned, and so many

            </p>
            <p>1. If every man in the world hath this <hi>Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:43125:234"/>
work</hi> on them? what's the Reason we find
none in the world (no not the wisest) until they
have the Scripture, or the Doctrine thereof some
way opened to them, that have been able to give
us the least Tidings of any such business.</p>
            <p>2. What's the Reason that so few in the world
have any shew of Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> much less a
sound and and saving turning of the whole Soul
unto God?</p>
            <p>87] Why do the <hi>Quakers</hi> make such adoe about
their <hi>Apostles</hi> Men and Women as if that <hi>glorious
Light</hi> the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> in every man were
not able to teach <hi>Effectually</hi> (by his <hi>Extraordinary</hi>
and <hi>miraculous power</hi>) without their outward speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Seed,</hi> that is to <hi>God within</hi> them?</p>
            <p>4. If they themselves teach by such an <hi>Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi>
and <hi>miraculous power</hi> as the Prophets of old,<note place="margin">Miracles.</note>
and the Apostles of Christ Jesus did, what should
be the Cause why we see no such <hi>miraculous deeds</hi>
done by any of them? The Truth is, God is pleased
to chain up <hi>Sathan:</hi> otherwise, the <hi>Foxians</hi> would
have their longing (which it may be some shall
after them) But if they shall be permitted by God
and assisted by the <hi>Devil</hi> to do as the <hi>Magicians</hi>
did: yet if their <hi>Doctrine</hi> be other then what is
written (as I have abundantly proved it to be) while
they cry out <hi>Light, Light,</hi> there is none as <hi>Isaiah</hi>
speaketh, not a Spark of <hi>Light</hi> within them.</p>

I Reply, 1. (As before, and as thousands know)
that the word <hi>Gospel</hi> is in all <hi>Languages glad News,</hi>
the same which the <hi>Angel</hi> brought to the <hi>Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds</hi>

of men to embrace the Gospel, or glad News of a

hearing of this glad News, it is the Devils and the

               <hi>The</hi> 50th Instance <hi>of G.</hi> Fox <hi>his lame Answer is

<pb n="472" facs="tcp:43125:243"/>
God called (because of his manifold operations) the

<hi>upon Christ and his,</hi> Heb: <hi>Opposite to these are
the</hi> unclean Spirits <hi>spirits of Devils,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. The Spirits of men, first, saints, as <hi>Mary</hi> sings,
<hi>my Spirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour,</hi> &amp;c. and
opposite to these are the Spirits of the wicked as

            </p>
            <p>2. I observe that in this <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. the Spirit of
God speaks not of the Bodies of the Saints neither
Conjoynd, nor a-part. Nor secondly of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
made perfect, but the Spirits of First, the
Righteous: Therefore it seems to hold forth not a
perfect State of the Saints in this Life, Consisting
of Spirits and Bodies, [99] which our proud Boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
say of themselves, nor that they are perfect:
Nor secondly, of the Estate of the Saints in the
world to come, where all <hi>true Protestants</hi> hold, that
the Bodies and Souls of the Saints shall be perfected,
and <hi>Everlastingly</hi> (and as to us now) <hi>Inconceivably
glorified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Estate of the Souls or Spirits of the
Elect, who are (as some Translate) perfected, some
<hi>Consummated</hi> or <hi>finished,</hi> some grounded, or now
<hi>(Everlastngly Established,</hi> while their visible part,
<hi>the Body sleeps in Iesus</hi> until the <hi>joyful Resurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Thus it appears the rather to be, because we
find in all the <hi>holy Records</hi> the Spirits, Souls, and
Bodies of the highest Saints in this world defective
and subject to great failings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>I <hi>Answer,</hi> The holy spirit testifies that he is the

that he Comforts the [103] Saints in the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,

            <p>5. There have been persons professing the Order

all that had a hand in his Condemnation and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
The Drunkard hates his Sin as a Tyrant

it with the unclean person, and every other sinner.

and <hi>Quakers,</hi> who say, they can, and the <hi>Papists</hi>
more also then God commandeth?</p>
            <p>2. Christ did not mock, but meekly and savingly
teach the young man, when he Answered, <hi>If thou

he mock the <hi>Iews,</hi> dealing with them upon the
Terms of <hi>Iustice: Obey and live, Transgress and die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a pertinent question, why was the holy Law

Detracters from them? Doth he not throughout
all his Book, and all of them in word and writing
deny the holy Scripture to be the word of God,

ever the Devil vomit out more poyson (against God

do in their undermining the holy Scriptures?
Some know it not: Some of them speak Reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of it: The very <hi>Papists</hi> Confess it to be the very
word or Speech of God: But the <hi>Devil</hi> and the
<hi>Quakers</hi> abhor to hear them <hi>Verbum Dei</hi> the Word
of God.</p>
            <p>These bewitched Soules affirme they have a <hi>higher

against the Counsels and purposes of God as

            </p>
            <p>4. Until the coming of Christ Jesus we know
the Command of the most holy God to private
persons, to the Princes, to the Priests, to the whole
Assembly to offer up Sacrifice and Expiation for all
sorts of failings, yea, for Sins of Ignorance, yea, and
for their coming short in their holy offerings:
Hence <hi>David</hi> cries out, <hi>Psal. 143. Enter not into
Iudgement or Reckoning with thy Servant,</hi> &amp;c. and
<hi>Psal. 19. Cleanse thou me from secret sins, for who
