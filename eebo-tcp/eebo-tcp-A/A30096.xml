            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>TWas you, my Dear Friend, with whom I first enjoyed the Pleasures of Friendship, and 'twas you that first invited me; though not into the Garden of the <hi>Hesperides,</hi> yet into a Field of great Usefulness, and infinite Delight; where, after the


<pb facs="tcp:52910:4"/>
Fatigue and Embarrasment of a troublesome Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, like the wearied Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, I have often at Night lain down, and refreshed my tired Spirits. If I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nodded in the following Pamphlet, be you my Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Excuse.</p>
            <p>But whatever it is, to you, <hi>Dear Sir,</hi> of right it belongs, being that good Friend, that first shewed me my Faults, and moved me to a Study, which has given me a true Prospect of the Trifles of Life, and how much more valuable the Unseen Things are, than those our Senses daily converse with. For,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>

                  <pb facs="tcp:52910:4"/>
As the kind <hi>Heavenly Genius</hi> when we go</l>
               <l>Out of that <hi>Path</hi> appointed us below;</l>
               <l>Mov'd with great Pity t'our declining State,</l>
               <l>Do's softly whisper, <hi>Turn;</hi> ere 'tis too late:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>So my <hi>Leander,</hi> when I went astray</l>
               <l>From the <hi>unbeaten</hi> Path of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues Way,</l>
               <l>Swifter than Lightning dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a Cloud,</l>
               <l>Stretch'd forth his hand. —</l>
            </lg>
            <p>But I forget I am in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and that this is not my Province.</p>
            <p>

               <pb facs="tcp:52910:5"/>
This shew, that the Body is too gross to enjoy a refin'd Pleasure, and that the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of a man given to the Delights of Contemplation and Search, are too lofty to be allur'd down to sensual En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments. <hi>Aquila non capit Muscas. Des Cartes</hi> expresses it well: <q>
                  <hi>Voluptas quam percipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ex intuitu rerum, quas oculi cernunt, minimè aequiparanda est cum illa, quam adfert notitia illa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum quas Philosophando invenimus.</hi> The Pleasures of Sense, are in no sort comparable to those, which the Mind en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys by Knowledge and Philosophy.</q> So that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy and Religion, or the latter alone, have truly the better on't in this Life, as well


<pb facs="tcp:52910:5"/>
as the next. God bids fairer for our Service, than all things else besides.</p>
            <p>But to do Justice to both; I must acknowledge the <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualist</hi> has Pleasures and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions (such as they are) more ready and at hand, than a man of Thought and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement. The one had need but look out, and he sees something that is ready to fill up the narrow Faculties of Sense presently, whilst the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must go farther off, and with great industry find out an Object that is noble e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to divert and entertain him. The Pleasures of the one, are like Diamonds, rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found; but of the


<pb facs="tcp:52910:6"/>
other, like Pebbles, every where to be had. Yet this Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage the Learned and the Wise, the vertuous Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, when advanced to some Height, has over the other, that he carries his Pleasures with him, in the Streets, or in the Fields, or even in disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Company, can find use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and pleasing Thoughts, both to delight and improve his Mind; who not only dares be alone, but finds infinite Pleasure in the <hi>Contemplation</hi> of the several parts of the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse;</hi> to whom, with <hi>Jacob,</hi> the <hi>World</hi> is a <hi>Bethel;</hi> for he can turn the <hi>Darkness</hi> of a <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,</hi> into the <hi>Light</hi> o a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Palace,</hi> and behold <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ascending</hi> and <hi>descending,</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:52910:6"/>
like the <hi>Angels</hi> on the <hi>Ladder.</hi> But not to pretermit any of the excellent Advantages the Dissolute enjoy.</p>
            <p>The one, I must confess, more constantly gains his Point, than the other; for what with his sordid Flattery, and Baseness of Spirit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Great and Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his Insolence towards the Modest and Humble, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mean and disingenuous Arts towards all, he obtains what he desires. But did a Beggar gain a Crown by such means, he were not worth my Envy; for when a little Affliction befalls such an one, so loose is his Constitution, by the unsetledness of his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,


<pb facs="tcp:52910:7"/>
(if a constant Byas to Baseness of Spirit may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unsetled,) he dissolves under the weight of a little misfortune; a few Weeks im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment puts an end to his Life: But how does the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous sit smooth and sedate, whilst Lightning invades his Eyes, and Thunder his House? Who though he would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve in Tears, for the least voluntary Sin, yet would not shrink to see the World in a general Conflagration; who goes out of this Life with the same Joy a man goes to see his affectionate Friend. Give me the man, who having secur'd the Divine Love by an universal Obedience, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries his own Heaven with


<pb facs="tcp:52910:7"/>
him where-ever he goes; that can see in every Field enough of the Divine Wisdom to fill all the Powers of his Soul with a lasting Joy and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Compar'd to these, how mean are the Thoughts of a last Night's Debauch, or the expecting ones of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? How sordid the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of many Bags, and how empty the Titles of Honour? For my part, I have not Sence enough to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish any real difference between a Feather in a Child's Cap, and a Riband cross the Shoulders of a Man. Ah! how foolish is Mankind to neglect the solid Joys of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Philosophy, for the Rattles and Trifles of Life!


<pb facs="tcp:52910:8"/>
So that (the next World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part) with great Truth I may affirm, That the most voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man alive, enrich'd with the Fancy of <hi>Aristippus,</hi> or a <hi>Lord Rochester,</hi> that does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge his Senses with all the Art that Wit, Health and Riches can lay together, that has all the Court which the Devil in Nature, is capable of making to him; falls infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely short of the Pleasures of a Man, that has a good Understanding, well govern'd Affections, and but a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Fortune to enable him to enjoy the Pleasures of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, and to exert his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the pleasing Offices of Charity and Affection.</p>
            <p>

               <pb facs="tcp:52910:8"/>
The <hi>Cynicks</hi> and <hi>Stoicks</hi> will charge me with a surplus of Ingredients to the constitution of Happiness; but I conceive their Notion of it to be Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick and Fanciful; but that of the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> and <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi> sober and wise. For <hi>Externals,</hi> in the hands of a wise man are good Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments even of Beatitude; and Pleasure and Pain must have some difference even in the opinion of a Philosopher that is conversant in the World. 'Tis a foolish thing to make Vertue the Object of a wise man's choice, and then set it above his reach, at least above his desires; Vertue <note n="a" place="margin">Thus high the <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks</hi> and <hi>Stoicks</hi> advanced Vertue, whose sole Reward, which it self brought, they held sufficient to conquer the Miseries of Pain and Want.</note> I mean,


<pb facs="tcp:52910:9"/>
stripp'd of Health and Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, and clogg'd with Pain and Misery, without the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of a future Life. But the <hi>Cynick</hi> indeed had Wit, when being blam'd for giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Pattern above Human Life, said, he was like the Singing Masters, who sung a Note too high, that their Scholars (who would natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fall short of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster) might reach a true Pitch.</p>
            <p>I must confess, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Lives, not only of the <hi>Cynicks,</hi> but others of the <hi>Pagan Philosophers,</hi> and to what a Noble Height they advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their Minds, meerly by the due exercise of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings;


<pb facs="tcp:52910:9"/>
how meanly and contemptibly they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon sensual Pleasures, to that degree, that the former trampled upon Riches and Honour as vile things; <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisthenes,</hi> the Father of them, saying, he had rather be mad, than given to Sensuality; and <hi>Heraclitus</hi> contemn'd his Body, esteeming it as Dross, taking care for the Cure on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as God should command him, to use it as an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and this not as a sudden Fit or Passion, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of Wit, but as a setled Principle rooted in their minds, and exerting its Fruit and Effects in their Lives: I blush both for my self, and other Christians, to

            <p>It may be enough to make a Christian asham'd, even in Heaven, to see <hi>Hermes, Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras, Socrates, Plato,</hi> and the whole Crowd of vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Heathens there, bearing the Honourable Badges of Mortification, and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Scars of Reproach, and Wounds, for Vertue's sake, as a Sacrifice pleasing to God; whilst the Christian, at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, beholding in himself the Marks only of Professing his Religion, where there was no danger in the doing it, and having received much,

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>I Writ this <hi>Essay</hi> for my own Satisfaction and Use, and now publish it to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Honour of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> whom, though I would not, with the Heathen, Deifie for his emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Works; yet I would defend him from the Calumny of the


<pb facs="tcp:52910:14"/>
World, so unjustly cast upon him, as the Author of an erroneous Doctrine. This is a Tribute, all Men that pretend to Letters (to which I do the least) owe him, that has advanced Learning; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who seems to have been a Treasury of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and that Fountain that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire with all that Learning they afterwards boasted. Nor were his Morals less refin'd, than his Knowledge was eminent, and his Wisdom was equal to both; so that should I give an Account of his Life, how careful he was to subdue all sensual Passions; how temperate in his Diet, Cloaths and Sleep; how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable to improve and adorn his Mind with all the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that was to be attained; how


<pb facs="tcp:52910:14"/>
zealous to promote the Honour of God, and the Good of Man; how careful to reflect on the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Day; and in short, to advance all Vertue, and depress Vice; 'twould put most of us out of countenance, to be so much out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by a Heathen. The Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication therefore of so good and great a Person, I hope, will not be thought impertinent.</p>
            <p>But besides that, I propose to manifest this Opinion, not only as Orthodox &amp; Philosophical amongst the Ancients, but as True and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident in Nature. Though were it only a speculative Notion, and of no Use, as for me, it should have slept in eternal Shades; but in regard it acquaints us, in its full Latitude, with the various Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions


<pb facs="tcp:52910:15"/>
of God, the Generation and Dissolution of all Created Beings, under Heaven, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses and Recesses of Life it self; it is a Subject not so mean as to be despised, though it may be here but indifferently handled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who has defin'd Happiness well, places it in the Tranquillity of the Mind, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence of the Body. To attain this, he makes <hi>Physicks</hi> as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary as <hi>Ethicks;</hi> for without knowing the Causes of Things, Fear and Doubts perplex the Mind, and disturb that Quiet which is necessary to Happiness.</p>
            <p>I am sure it is the Duty of all Men, that have Capacity and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,


<pb facs="tcp:52910:15"/>
to look into the <hi>Works,</hi> as well as <hi>Word</hi> of God. The Heathens had no other Book to read the Majesty, Wisdom and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God in; it was <hi>the Heavens</hi> that <hi>declared</hi> to them, as well as the inspired King, <hi>his Glory.</hi> Nor does the Knowledge of God's moral Government of the World, supersede the Consideration of his Natural; the latter being as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy our Admiration and Praise, as the former is of our Love and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, God has in nothing so intensely exhibited his Love to Mankind, as in giving his Son; nor can Man receive a greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, than by being the Temple of the Divine Mind. The Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of which, may well strike us


<pb facs="tcp:52910:16"/>
with Astonishment, the Favour is so immense, and ought in Justice to raise our Thoughts above the Dregs of Sense.</p>
            <p>But though a Man, in so large a Field as this, may never want Matter to exercise his Thoughts upon, and to raise his Mind to a noble Height; yet whoever consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Nature of Mankind, will soon find, that the Mind of Man is of a very inquisitive and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Nature; that variety of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are more necessary for his Mind, than of Food for his Body; that by this he enlarges his Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, advances his Thoughts, and comes to discern a clearer Light and Knowledge of Things. Nay, the Acts of Religion it self, are often better performed, with more


<pb facs="tcp:52910:16"/>
Vigour and Zeal, after some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, than when often repeated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some Diversion. And God having created such Variety of Things, wherein dwells so great an Excellency, does more than hint to us our Duty to enquire after them.</p>
            <p>The Reproof of the <hi>Psalmist, They neglect the Works of God.</hi> — That <hi>the Works of the Lord are great, sought out by all that have pleasure in them;</hi> That <hi>they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be praised, and had in honour,</hi> and ought <hi>to be had in remembrance, and spoke of;</hi> That <hi>the Power and Glory of God might be made known unto Men,</hi> does include a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to search into them. <hi>Isaiah,</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:52910:17"/>
speaking of the <hi>Jews,</hi> saith, <hi>They regard not the Works of the Lord, neither consider the Operations of his Hands. Therefore my People are gone into Captivity, because they have no Knowledge.</hi> God preferr'd our Knowledge of him, even under the Law, to Burnt Offerings; and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is plain; for unless we know somewhat of the Nature of the <hi>Eternal,</hi> we can neither pay that Love to his Goodness, nor Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his Power, which we owe to both; we can in no sort serve him acceptably, but we shall run into the Superstition of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> who dedicated Altars <hi>Deo ignoto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

               <pb facs="tcp:52910:17"/>
For my part, I know no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that distinguisheth Men from Brutes, but Knowledge and Vertue; the first makes us like <hi>Angels,</hi> the latter like <hi>God. Be ye holy as I am holy.</hi> But <hi>Vertue without Knowledge,</hi> runs into <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition;</hi> and <hi>Knowledge without Vertue,</hi> gives us the <hi>Tincture of Satan.</hi> Both therefore are to be sought, which may be attained by a little industry; for surely we are not <hi>born</hi> to <hi>eat, drink</hi> and <hi>sleep,</hi> and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie our sensual Appetites, like Beasts, (nay they all perform some beneficial Offices to Men,) nor to snort in the Air, like a Colt; nor to trample on the Earth, like an Ox; nor to walk in the narrow Track of our Employment, like a


<pb facs="tcp:52910:18"/>
Foot-post; but to contemplate the Divine Operations, and to look up towards God with Gratitude, for making so glorious a World, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish'd with such admirable works for the Use and Benefit of Man. If this be not so, and that it is sufficient for a Man, to attain an Excellency in his Employment, though he has a liberal Education; what difference is there between a <hi>Littleton</hi> and a <hi>Van Dyke,</hi> both famous in their way?</p>
            <p>I must agree with <hi>Epicurus,</hi> That Justice is the common Tie, without which no Society can sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist; 'tis that Vertue, which gives to all their due, and takes care that none receive Injury. 'Tis therefore one of the noblest Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; yet if the knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,


<pb facs="tcp:52910:18"/>
(for I speak not of its Morals,) be confined to a City or a Country; if it be meerly municipal, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from ones Country, 'tis but Pedantry; and therefore no Man has Reason to value himself much on that account. But the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher</hi> is <hi>a Citizen of the World, acquainted</hi> with the <hi>Pandects of Nature;</hi> the other <hi>a Citizen</hi> of <hi>England, Venice,</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> and confin'd to the Walls thereof.</p>
            <p>The employing our Thoughts, how the Earth is continually send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth a Vapour; the Sea, and all its Rivers, giving up their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd Parts into the Air, to meet, and allay the scorching Influences of the Heavenly Bodies. That since the Water of it self is too


<pb facs="tcp:52910:19"/>
gross a Food for the Lungs, and the Celestial Heat too violent and intense, to cherish and support us; <hi>therefore</hi> God stretches out the Waters on the Wings of the Wind, and rarefies the same; and that it may be exempt from excessive Cold, impregnates it with Vital Heat, to become the truest Food of Life.</p>
            <p>That the Heavenly Bodies are continually at work for us, by their perpetual motion, emitting a vital Heat, which cloathing it self with an Aerial Vest, enters into the Chambers of the Deep, and there frames all that Variety, which, coming forth, we call the Works of Nature.</p>
            <p>

               <pb facs="tcp:52910:19"/>
And that the Earth may not be too dry, nor the Rivers too empty, by a constant yielding up their Moisture into the Region of the Air, on the absence of the Sun, the Vapour condenses into a fertil Dew, which descending, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes the thirsty Plants; and lest this should not be enough, the Clouds become Store-houses of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And whereas the inward Parts of the Earth are kept moist and cool by the infinite Channels, through which the Waters pass; so the upper parts are refreshed by a more plentiful Irrigation, which is of more virtue than Fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, having somewhat of the Heavenly Influences. He that beholds the Rays of the Sun against an opake Body, darting obliquely on the Earth its Seminal Virtues,


<pb facs="tcp:52910:20"/>
and considers that by the Command of the <hi>Eternal,</hi> the Wheel of Providence is continually at work for us, (which brings Life it self, being nothing else, as the Learned <hi>Monsieur d'Espagnet</hi> says, but <hi>an Harmonious Act proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Union of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Form, constituting the perfect Being of every Individual,</hi>) which the Ancients sometimes represented by <hi>Vulcan</hi> in his Shop, making and hammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out curious Works. I say, be that considers these things (which a mean Understanding is capable of,) if he has any spark of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, any Sense of Obligation; nay, if he is not worse than a Brute, and more stupid than a Block, must be inflamed with the Love of so immense a Bounty;


<pb facs="tcp:52910:20"/>
which when he is, be will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally express it, not only by an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Obedience to so infinite a Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; not only by an abstinence from all appearance of Evil; but by chusing to do what is most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently Good, and most highly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him. Of what Use such a Temper of Mind would be, both to the Person in particular, and the World in general, I need not declare, since <hi>Love,</hi> (which <hi>Plato</hi> calls the most Ancient of the Gods,) is the most ravishing Passion, and the most delightful Enjoyment: That <hi>Love,</hi> whose Centre is infinite Purity, who is continually issuing forth such ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Light, Joy and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure on the Mind of Man, that we seem but faintly to dart back somewhat of that Love to the <hi>most</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:52910:21"/>
               <hi>Munificent,</hi> which the Shallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our Capacities were unable to receive; <hi>for he first loved us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis impertine nt here to describe the Beauty of the World, the Glory and Excellency of its Parts, the Harmony and Order, the Useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Benefit thereof to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, since <hi>Tully</hi> has done it in his <hi>Natura Deorum,</hi> beyond imitation: This Sir <hi>Roger L'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strange</hi> has ingeniously Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and embellished with Learned Notes.</p>
            <p>The Wisdom and Order by which the Parts were moved, made the <hi>Stoicks</hi> think, even the Parts themselves endued with an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Mind, and therefore, weakly


<pb facs="tcp:52910:21"/>
enough, called them Gods, not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing between the Creator and his Works, which <hi>Epicurus</hi> hath well confuted. But I am pass'd my Tedder, and must ask Pardon of our Clergy for inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Province.</p>
            <p>The Sum of all is this; 'Tis the Duty of Mankind to consider the Natural, as well as Moral Government of Divine Providence. This is the Mean to attain the End of our Creation, <hi>i. e.</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Glory of God, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt and perfect our Minds. If what I have hinted, does suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently shew the Necessity of this, the Neglect of it is a Fault too obvious to need an Inference, and the doing it, an Advantage, that will justifie (at least, excuse) the following <hi>Essay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

               <pb facs="tcp:52910:22"/>
I have but this to add, That whatever are the Faults of the following Discourse, I have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided one, which the Learned generally incur; that is, of being <hi>too praeliminary:</hi> One must dig fifteen Fathom deep before one comes to the <hi>Oar;</hi> thus infolding a little Truth in so much Rubbish, makes him that has a quick Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, and little Leisure, neglect the former for the sake of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But this Fault proceeds from a foolish, though customary Fancy, that unless a Book has <hi>Folio 500</hi> at the End of it, it makes no Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure on a Shelf, but is like to dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle into the contemptible Name of a Pamphlet. Hence the dull and heavy Transcribers load Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind with intolerable Burthens, and Men, like Asses, receive that


<pb facs="tcp:52910:22"/>
Weight, which fills their Heads rather with Smoak and Fume, than Light and Truth.</p>
            <p>When I consider that the Wisest of Men have delivered their Thoughts of Men and Things, rather in short <hi>Apothegms,</hi> than tedious Discourses; and that the Witty <hi>Greeks</hi> brought even Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments into the narrow compass of a short <hi>Sillogism;</hi> that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> writ the History of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a short Chapter; and that He who is more than Man, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated himself, and what was necessary for the Good of Man, in short Parables, that make a deep impression on the Mind; and in pithy Sentences, that may be writ in a Sheet or two of Paper. I am fully of opinion with the Ingenious


<pb facs="tcp:52910:23"/>
Mr. <hi>Norris,</hi> That if Angels were to write, we should have fewer Volumes, and that the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of this Discourse is no real Exception to its Truth.</p>

            <head>OF Transmigration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THis Opinion of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration of Souls, which is father'd upon <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> is <hi>mistaken every where;</hi> but very grosly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in <hi>Pegu, Magor,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Asia:</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that the Soul doth pass into some other Creature, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its departure from the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Body, they abstain from no sort of respect to the most contemptible Creatures,


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52910:30"/>
and superstitiously avoid do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any hurt to that Animal whose Body, they think, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Soul of their deceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Father. Now, how they could tell, or why they should think, that this, or that Beast is thus animated, rather than another, I confess is strange: and what is more so, it seems from the Belief of those in <hi>Bengall,</hi> and other Parts of the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> (who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the Souls of Good Men pass into Cows, and such useful Creatures; and the Souls of Bad Men into Crows and such hurtful Birds or Beasts,) that these People think it of the Immortal Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul, rather than the Sensitive. For the Faculties


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52910:30"/>
of the Rational Soul are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted naturally in the kind Offices of Beneficence and Humanity; but those of the Sensitive, only in Growth and Sense. It looks as if Folly begot, and Superstitious Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy propagated this Opinion: Though to do Right to <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi> who was doubtless a great Man, the absurdity of this Opinion is as far remote from his Sentiments, as the <hi>Manichaean</hi> Heresie is different from the <hi>Christian Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Philosophy and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion have both suffered alike by Ignorant Expositors: For what will not a wild Fancy and little Judgment, center'd in a Man fond of his own Thoughts, produce? What


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52910:31"/>
strange Opinions in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? What barbarous Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by Humane Sacrifices to the Heathen Gods, hath the World been filled with? Nor is Philosophy it self exempt from very odd Conceits. Thus are the best Things corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>But to return to our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, whose Opinion asserted is, <hi>That the Soul, after its depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the Body, passes into some other Animal.</hi> This is as strongly put as any thing said of him (for we have all by Tradition,) will bear. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Opinion I propose to defend and free it from the Absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Men have put upon it, and restore it to its native Sence. But let me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>


               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:52910:31"/>
here, That I do not intend this Migration of the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Soul; but of the Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Vegetative Spirit; which Terms of Soul and Spirit, being often used as <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonyma's,</hi> have given occasion, especially to the Ignorant, to mistake the meaning of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that considers the Frame of this World, the Contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man, and the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Vicissitude and Change of Things, will easily believe, that either God makes new Matter and Form daily, to supply the perishing old; or that Things pass, and are changed into one another, by a continual Circulation. But we all know that the Eternal


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52910:32"/>
having made the World by his Wisdom and Power, does preserve it now by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Goodness; so that we must be forc'd to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, not a new Creation, but a Mutation of Things, that begets this Variety.</p>
            <p>Man indeed is endowed with something more than the rest of the Creatures; he hath a Rational Soul, that should sit President in his Body, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his Passions, and direct his Affections. How little it does so, proceeds from the Vileness of our Wills, rather than the Degeneracy of our Nature: but we would excuse our selves. Besides this, he hath a Vegetative or Sensitive Spirit, which is perfectly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52910:32"/>
from the Rational Soul, as well as Body: It seems to be a <hi>Medium</hi> to unite two Extreams, of a Divine Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Ray, and Gross Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>I am not discoursing now of the Government of the Mind over the Sensitive Part, and what Obedience the one ought to pay the other; nor how they contend for Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, like Prerogative and Liberty in a disturb'd State: But I am laying the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Reasonableness of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Opinion, which is the <hi>Transmigration of Souls,</hi> or Spirits; for these Terms are used equivocally.</p>
            <p>To go to the bottom of this Question, 'tis fit to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52910:33"/>
Nature in her several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, <hi>Mineral, Vegetable,</hi> and <hi>Animal;</hi> for all created Beings on this side Heaven, may be placed under one of these Heads; nor are the meanest of them without a Spirit, or Vital Principle, which is all one; and these, like the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Souls of Animals, eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate on the Dissolution or Destruction of their Bodies.</p>
            <p>To say how these Spirits leave their Habitations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I offer how they enter, may be improper; I shall speak therefore of this first, and then of the other. Nor will it be impertinent, to the Defence of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, since <hi>Transanimation</hi> of Spirits may refer as well to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals</hi>

This, I conceive, is the meaning of <hi>Democritus,</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> That the first Element of Things is void of Quality, that is, undertermin'd.

            <p>But to return from whence <note place="margin">Of their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</note> I have digress'd; taking things now as we find them, can it be a wonder that all Plants of the same sort, have much the same Figure and Colour? 'Tis not certainly from their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of pressing through the Earth, that they obtain the same likeness; for how should it happen, that the <hi>Species</hi> of every Herb should have such a particular manner of pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing through the Earth, as to make it always retain the same shape?</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52910:39"/>
But I rather conceive that the saline Particles that joyn with the Vapour, being so and so modified, (for they must have some Figure,) do determine the genéral Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, as well to a constant uniform Figure and Colour, as to a particular internal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Quality.

forth, are supplied by the Influx of new, and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by the Universal: so in the Business of Generation, as well as afterwards, the Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Spirit is enlarged and multiplied by the Influx of the General, or Universal. Now this is more or less ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how the Universal Spirit joyns with the Specifick, in the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</note> to the activity of the Specifick Spirit; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the nature of Light, doth attract its like with more or less vigor; not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like an enkindled, though not flaming Lamp, whose Smoak or Effluviums, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a neighbouring Light, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts it, and becomes enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by it at a distance; and by how much the Effluviums are more powerful, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract

a greater Proportion of Light: For Light naturally joyns and unites with Light, as Fire with Fire; and the Souls of Animals (the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal excepted,) are a Ray of Heavenly Light.</p>
            <p>Hence it comes to pass, that, in Men, Horses, and other Animals, you shall have a vast difference; the Race of some, appearing always full of Life, and, as it were, all Spirit, whilst that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, are always heavy and dull, and as it were, half ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated. And thus it is in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Plants, which every Gardener knows by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for you shall have, in the same kind, some produce great increase, and others ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

little, in the same Soil. Now I see no Reason, why the Universal Spirit may not joyn with the Specifick in Generation, as well as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. And why not in that of Animals, as well as in the Production of Vegetables? For though it is in the moist <note place="margin">That the Universal Spirit is more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully in the Air, than else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</note> Vapour latent in the Earth, as I hinted before, and imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed more or less plentifully, according to the activity of the Form; so is it more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensely in the Air, in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sphere; for the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Spirit lodging principally there, permeates through all the Parts of the Universe, and is that Nature that is always ready, and at hand, to vivifie disposed Matter.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:52910:47"/>
That the Universal Spirit <note place="margin">That the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit increases in Animals.</note> does multiply the animal one, after the Birth, is obvious to the Understanding of all Men; for that portion of animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that animates an Infant, would scarce give motion to a Manly Bulk. But I think we may with as much reason deny the Growth and Increase of the Body, as that of the Spirit. All Men that know the Benefit of good air, and the Mischief of bad, must acknowledge it. How do the weak and languishing in a good air recover Strength, and obtain new Spirit and Vigour? And how languid and sickly do Men become in a bad?</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:52910:47"/>
And this may well be; for the Animal Spirits are of an Aereal Principle; which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from hence; whilst they inhabit the Body, thro' the intimate Union with the Air, the Body is preserved sweet; the Air continually flowing in, adding new stores of Life, and giving Motion, as it were, to the whole Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine: But when the animal Spirit is departed, then for want of that Communion, the Body putrefies and stinks.

            <p>The Reason of bad Air is <note place="margin">The Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of Sulphurous Vapors flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuating in the Air; that they cause the Plague.</note> occasioned by the grossness of the Watery Humors, or Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous Vapors that annoy the Celestial Influences, by

            <p>The good Air, and the <note place="margin">The Benefit of good Air.</note> Life and Spirit it brings, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the sublimation of a light Water, acuated with a volatil Nitre, which being rarefi'd and impregnated with the Heavenly Influences, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys down Life, new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits to the Spirits of <hi>Animals,</hi> as well as to <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</hi>

The Philosophers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when they spoke of the First Principles of Nature, or of her excellent Operations, could call them no less than Gods, after the Laws of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.

He that considers how soon Sin entred into the World, and that ever since Mankind hath been beset with Sin, Error and Folly, (of which he has been very fruitful even from the beginning;) that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil hath advanced his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to a great height; that Error is more ancient than <hi>Adam,</hi> will not be easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded to believe, that what

is most ancient, is therefore most true, though gilded with a shew of Learning. Were there not erroneous Tenets in Christianity coaevous with the Apostles? Who then can say that the bare antiquity of an Opinion is a good Argument for it's Truth?

            <p>Now the Great Men <note place="margin">The Fables of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to Things, not Persons.</note> was speaking of, have been exceeding industrious to find out to what Persons the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Poets do relate;

            <p>

               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:52910:70"/>
No one sure will think this <note place="margin">Objection.</note> Opinion does invade the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Resurrection since there can be no need of <note place="margin">Respons.</note> a <hi>Medium,</hi> where there are no <hi>Extreams.</hi> The cloathing of the Blessed Spirits after this Life, will doubtless be with a Robe of Light, because they are always to appear before the Father of Lights. Our Saviour's Transfiguration may give us a glimpse of this; but where Flesh and Blood can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter, what need can there be of a Sensitive Spirit?</p>
            <p>But I think this Matter <note place="margin">Of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentity of Form in all Bodies.</note> may be carried higher than the Opinion laid down of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras;</hi> for this very Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Light and Heat, when it is free from its Body of


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52910:70"/>
whatever sort, may penetrate Matter that may concrete into Stone or Metal, produce a Vegetable, or insinuate into an Animal-Matrix, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate in the Generation of the <hi>Foetus;</hi> for it is homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous with the Vital Heat in all but their Specification. 'Tis true, <hi>Eirenaeus the Great,</hi> has said, There is nothing that has a Seminal Virtue applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to two things. But this is spoken of a Seminal Virtue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in some Body, not at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and free, but specifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and determin'd.</p>
            <p>That this Spirit is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, I need not go back to the first Abyss and Form, to shew the Identity of Matter and Form in General, (which was


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52910:71"/>
afterwards divided and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd according to the Proportion of Matter and Form,) to prove the Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Spirit in all these Three. 'Tis enough here to shew, that Minerals and Plants, (not to mention Animals,) being Physick and Food for Man, are, by application to him, assimilated into his Nature, and that only by the Power of his own Specifick Spirit; which shews them to be of his own Matter and Form, or it could not attract and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert into its own Nature what is repugnant to it (<note n="a" place="margin">Aliment (says <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>) must be the same potentially, which the Thing aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, or nourished, is in Act.</note>). But that there is an Homogeneity of Spirit in all the Three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of Nature, will appear from hence (if it be true)


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:52910:71"/>
that from the Dross of Metals reduc d to Ashes, are genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Beetles;</hi> from Plants, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillers;</hi> from Fruit, <hi>Maggots;</hi> and from putrefied Animals, <hi>Bees</hi> and <hi>Flies;</hi> so that an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Life flows from them all. And out of any <hi>Species</hi> of every one of the Three Kinds, may be drawn a Light burning, and fiery Spirit; which could not be, were they not homogeneous.</p>
            <p>The great difference which there seems to be between the several parts of the Creation, makes the People indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them of contrary Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Thus the Vulgar can hardly think that Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Water will ever become


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52910:72"/>
Wood, Leaves, Fruit, Bones, Sinews, Blood, and all the Parts of an Animal Body; But a Naturalist can easily discern, that the Water or moist Vapour, that dissolves the Seed, is by the Specifick Spirit of the Seed converted into its own Nature, and shoots up into Branches, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Leaves and Fruit, whose grosser part encreaseth the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Tree. And so the Water drank by Animals, becomes converted into Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, and is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into all the Parts of the Body, by which they all grow and are encreased to a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Time. Thus are all the Parts of the Universe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to each other by the


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52910:72"/>
common Bond of the same Universal Spirit, which <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menides</hi> in his famous <hi>Idea's</hi> calls <hi>That one Idea,</hi> which is the Foundation of all Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; out of which, as from a Thread, the whole Web, as it were, of Individuals, is woven.</p>
            <p>Now this Universal Spirit residing in many Particulars, is the Support and Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them all; and is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Zenophanes,</hi> wholly together one; though for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction sake, and that we may better understand one another in Discourse, we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it into Three Heads, which are called Kinds, and into almost infinite <hi>Species,</hi>


               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:52910:73"/>
which are the Particulars.</p>
            <p>Thus we see Nature, tho' She is One, Pure and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is yet beneficial to the whole Creation, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually supplies the perishing Old, by the Gift, as it were, of New. And thus we may see, that without God, who is Nature's Governor, we can do nothing even in this world.</p>
            <p>O Eternal Wisdom! How excellent are the Divine O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations! How manifold the divine Goodness! whose Wisdom, Power and Love are no less evident in the Conservation, than the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the World! If the Divine Mind should check

The Specification of it, naturally proceeds from the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.

            <p>As for the latter part of <note place="margin">Respons. 2.</note> the Objection, touching the Earth's having Seed enough in it self, and therefore needs not borrow of the Heavens: What I said already to the first part of the Question, may be a sufficient Answer. But to proceed.</p>
            <p>That the Earth is barren &amp; sluggish, dead and passive, we may easily see, by considering how unfruitful all places are that are surrounded with


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52910:80"/>
Buildings. For if the Earth had Seed enough in it self, she might be as fertil in a City-Garden, as in a Country. But it is plain, that the want of a free access of the Air, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by an Universal Spirit, or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating Heat is conveyed, is the only Cause of Sterility.</p>
            <p>Why do your Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, after some years plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, leave the Ground fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low? Is there not Seed or Virtue enough in the Earth to hold out? If there is not, whence does she receive it? It must proceed either inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally from the Centre, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally from the Heavens: if from her own Centre, why does she wait the accession of


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:52910:81"/>
the Sun, to call forth her Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables? And why, where his Influences are interrupted, is she barren?</p>
            <p>But may not the Earth <note place="margin">Object.</note> have a Feminine Sperm in it, and may not this vital Heat, be as a Masculine Principle, that may only excite, and bring this dormant Seed from Potency into Act, to which Opinion <hi>Xenocrates</hi> seems to be inclined? If the Earth <note place="margin">Resp.</note> were filled with such an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Seed, whenever the Sun approaches with his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livening Beams, surely all these Seeds would quickly appear to sight; what then should the Earth do for the next year's Vegetables? The


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52910:81"/>
Propagation of them only by their letting fall a Seed, and by that means another coming in its place, is weak and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; for though this in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places often happens, yet Experience shews us, that tho' Weeds are grubb'd up before they run to seed, yet the same, or others, soon grow up in their stead; And whence should this happen? Who are the Conservators of the seeds of Weeds, and noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Plants? Noxious, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their use is not known. What Enemy comes in the night and sows them? And where are their Store-houses?</p>
            <p>But may not the Birds in <note place="margin">Object.</note> the Air let fall seed, and so it may grow? This Objection


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52910:82"/>
can admit no Resolution but this: Take Earth, defend it <note place="margin">Resp.</note> as you please, so it has some access of Air, and you will find an Herb of some sort or other arise. It is therefore most evident, that by the Heavenly Bodies, or from them, a germinating Virtue is emitted; that this Virtue is universal, convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Medium</hi> of Air, filling all Places, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing divers Effects, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the plenty of Spirit, and difference of Place: That this Spirit, on the dissolution of its Body, is not annihilated, but gets loose, becomes active and vigorous, and impregnates new Matter, whose Nature


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52910:82"/>
is varied, according to the diversity of Place; as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mixing with salt things, becomes saline; and with Acids, sharp.</p>
            <p>Now, this to me, is so far <note place="margin">That Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed, not annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</note> from being a wonder, that I should admire if it were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise; since Bodies, that are but the Case of Spirits, are not annihilated, when their Spirits leave them, but lose only their external Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and Shape; for if Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies on their resolution, were annihilated, the World in time would be reduc'd to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>For the World consisting of Parts, and those Parts of


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52910:83"/>
Bodies, as Bodies are annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, so are the Parts; and the Parts being daily substra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, this Machine would fall to pieces, or rather to nothing. <q>But as in Generation, saith <hi>Epicurus,</hi> there is no new substance made, but pre-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istent substances are made up into one, which acquire new Qualities; so in Corruption, no substance absolutely ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be, but is dissipated into more substances, which remain after the destruction of the former.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So that though Bodies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve into Dust, yet this Dust remains still, and being quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a Solar Heat, shoots forth into some Plant; and


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52910:83"/>
this Plant becoming Food to Man or Beast, and Beast to Man, is assimilated into the Nature of the Eater, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes part of himself. Hence <hi>Hermes,</hi> and the rest of the Philosophers affirm, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing properly dies; but all things pass, and are changed into something else <note n="a" place="margin">In nihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum nil posse reverti.</note> So that if one would urge it, he might prove this way a <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration</hi> of Bodies, as well as Spirits; since the Bodies of the Dead become Food to the Living after a little Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Time, passing through a few <hi>Mediums,</hi> and that Food becomes part of him that eats it.</p>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:52910:85"/>
For Experience shews us, that many Men, by soft and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Habits, grow weak and effeminate; and by degrees slide into an Indulgence of all Brutal Passions. Now it is more than probable, that there was no more intended by this sort of Expression, than to shew Mankind to what a low Ebb Humane Nature might descend, to what a Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sordidness Man might sink that wallow'd in sensual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
            <p>And what is the natural Consequence of this? That Men therefore to avoid this Evil, should adorn and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate their Minds with useful Knowledge, and exert Life


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52910:85"/>
in Practical Vertues. This was the Design both of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Natural Philosophy; and this <hi>AEsop,</hi> who flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about an hundred years before <hi>Plato,</hi> inculcated by his ingenious Fables; amongst which, had this of <hi>Plato's</hi> been inserted, the Moral had been obvious to every Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>This is no new Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for <hi>Timaeus</hi> long ago commended the <hi>Ionick Poet,</hi> for making Men religious by ancient Fabulous Stories. <q>For, said he, as we cure Bodies with things unwholsome, when the wholesome agree not with them; so we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain Souls with Fabulous


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52910:86"/>
Relations, when they will not be led by the True. Let them then (continues he) since there is a necessity for it, talk of these strange Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, as if Souls did transmigrate; the Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate into the Bodies of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, given up to Ignominy; of Murtherers, into those of Beasts, for Punishment; of the Lascivious, into the forms of Swine; of the Light and Temerarious, into Birds; of the Slothful and Idle, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned and Ignorant, into several kinds of Fishes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we see how <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> has been miss-represented and what was made use of only as the last Remedy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain

Most certainly not; for <hi>Jamblicus</hi> in the Life of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> tells us, That he being the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Thales,</hi> one of the chief Things <hi>Thales</hi> advised him, was, to husband his Time well; upon which account, he abstained from Wine and Flesh; only eating such things as were light of Digestion;


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52910:87"/>
by which means, he procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red shortness of Sleep, Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, Purity of Mind, and constant Health of Body.</p>
            <p>But what if Transmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Transmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration in Plants and Minerals demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to sense.</note> may be made evident to Sense in Plants and Minerals? That it may be in Plants, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ordinary Chymist knows: For by the extracting the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or Soul of a Vegetable in the form of Oil, and by the cohobation of it on the calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Salt of a different Plant, they will impregnate that Salt with a new Life and Spirit, and give it new Virtue, Smell and Taste. Thus they draw forth a Spirit from one Plant and infuse it into the Body of another. And thus <hi>Van Suchten,</hi>

and the acuter sort of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, tell us may be done with Metals.</p>
            <p>But what need we fly to Laborious Art for the proof of this?

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Having already shewn, how variety of Plants and Metals are now generated in the Earth, from the Diversity of Salts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will endeavour to shew how the Earth comes


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52910:88"/>
to be filled with such variety of Bodies, abounding with different Qualities.</p>
            <p>First, As to the Duration <note place="margin">Of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Bodies.</note> of Bodies. Bodies, after the sensitive Spirit has left them, and before their resolution in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Dust, have a sort of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable Life remaining in them; as appears by the growth of Hair and Nails, that may be perceived in dead Bodies; and a weak Animal one that lurks in the Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture; whence in Putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Worms and divers sorts of Insects may be generated, who dying, others of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort arise.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:52910:89"/>
If therefore Bodies obtain this sort of Immortality (not to speak of the Resurrction of the Body in a Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Discourse,) why should it be denied to the Spirit, which hath a much greater Right to it, by the pure and incorrupt lasting Nature of its Essence?</p>
            <p>But I shall advance the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Bodies to a much more unmixt and pure Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: For the Radical Moisture of Bodies, that lies in the Bones, may justly challenge a Right (as things now are) to an eternal duration. For not to mention Bones that are found entire after a Thousand Years Burial, nor the Bodies


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52910:89"/>
of <hi>Egyptian Mummies,</hi> preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whole for several Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Years; there is in the Bones a Radical Moisture, that is fix'd and permanent, and is so far from giving way, or suffering loss by that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is the Destroyer of mix'd Bodies, that it is the Vessel made use of to purge the fix'd Metals in the Fire, and remains unhurt when the volatil Metals fly away; so that none of the Elements can destroy it, no not the most torrid <hi>Vulcan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for mix'd Bodies; Fire indeed may separate the Parts of a mix'd Body, change the Figure, and so alter its Appearance, as to puzzle


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52910:90"/>
the best Mechanick to reduce it to its primitive state; yet this is no Annihilation, but Division. The burning of Wood or any Fuel, is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of it, I confess, as to the Proprietor; but not with respect to the Universe, no more than there is less Money in the World by the Profuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a Prodigal; as the one doth but change Hands, so the other alters only the situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its Parts.</p>
            <p>The Watery or Mercurial Part of the Wood passeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in Smoak, the Oily or Sulphurous in Flame, and the Body of Salt rests in the Ashes. The Air preserves the two former, and the Earth retains


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52910:90"/>
the latter; each part returns to its native Country. What then can destroy this Body, except the <hi>First Cause,</hi> I am yet to learn: For though Bone-Ashes, by reason of Moisture, may flow and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Glass, the ultimate end and use of them; yet so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a lightsome body as that of Glass, is rather an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of its Essence, than diminution of its Excellency; nor does it give any termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to its Being, but only a change to its Figure. If Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linary Fire destroys the Parts of the Universe, in time it may the whole. But this is inconsistent with the Wisdom of its Maker, to create Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples destructive of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:52910:91"/>
The Light of Nature, as <note place="margin">Of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration.</note> well as Experience taught <hi>Plato,</hi> that the World was not destroyable by any other Cause, but by the same God, who composed it; which the <hi>Eternal</hi> can easily do by Fire, according as Things now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, without the Light of Holy Writ: Which makes me wonder, that <hi>Aristotle, Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophanes,</hi> and other Great Men did not see this; but thought the World of necessity as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal as God; for though the Heat of the Sun is now tolerable between the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, yet he that considers its being a little multiplied by a concave Glass, even in our Meridian, (though its Rays pass through a vast Region of


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52910:91"/>
Water rarefied,) if reflected on a Man for some time, it will scorch and destroy him, when the volatil Waters that allay his Heat, become fixed, (which the People think now are, and a Philosopher knows may easily be,) then the Sun having no Cloud to obstruct his Light, nor any Water to cool the scorching Heat of his Rays, will necessarily burn up and calcine the Earth.</p>
            <p>Thus the very Elements would destroy us, did not the <hi>Eternal,</hi> by his Providence, defend us from the Heat, by the interposition of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and from the Chilness of the Waters, by impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them with a Solar Heat,

            <p>Secondly, As to Principles <note place="margin">2. Of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Elements.</note> and Elements: being to speak of these, it will not be amiss to enquire, how and when these came into the World. The Study of <hi>Natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> was as early in the world, as Men came to call upon God: For whatever Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances God made to the <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diluvian Patriarchs,</hi> and by that means communicated his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will and Nature to them, yet we cannot suppose that the World in general had any other Light of the Divine


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52910:92"/>
Glory and Majesty, than what came to them by Tradition, and the Contemplation of the several Parts of the Universe; for God is known by his Works; they are the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of his Wisdom, Power, and Goodness. The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of these Works, comes not to Mankind (at least ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally) by Inspiration, but by exerting our Faculties.</p>
            <p>And as for Tradition, that is apt to make but a weak im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression on thinking Men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it is back'd with Reason.</p>
            <p>But besides, though the Creation of the World was a Tradition, and the manner out of <hi>Chaos;</hi> yet to give an


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52910:93"/>
account of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Things, and the manner now of Nature's Productions, could not be a Tradition. This was left to Man, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per exercise of his Rational Powers, that by improving, and advancing his Thoughts, he might come to have a clearer Light and Knowledge of God, and consequently, love him the more intensely; for it is almost impossible to have a true knowledge of God, and not to be inflamed with Love of him, such is the Purity and Perfection of the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>When Men therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to contemplate the works of God, they found all the


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52910:93"/>
Parts of Nature reduceable to two Heads or Principles; an Active, Vital or Formal one, and a Passive or Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.</p>
            <p>This I conceive <hi>Moses</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, when he tells us that in the Beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth: which things are expressed in the very same words by the <hi>Chaldeans, Assyrians,</hi> and <hi>Greeks,</hi> as I have hinted before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thales,</hi> who was one of the first amongst the <hi>Grecians,</hi> as, <hi>Laertius, Strabo, Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> affirm, that made en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into Natural Causes, conceived Water to be the Material Principle of all liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52910:94"/>
Creatures; because all Seed is humid, and Plants and Animals are nourish'd by it. This he had from a more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Nation, the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> by whom <hi>Orpheus</hi> was likewise instructed.</p>
            <p>To this Material Principle, <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> is said to be the first that added (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) the Mind, by which, I conceive, he meant the Formal. Hence <hi>Virgil</hi> calls the Universal Form the Mind.</p>

            <p>But <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Hesiod</hi> both gave an account of these two Principles long before.</p>
            <p>Various afterwards were the Opinions of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers about Principles. <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recydes</hi> the <hi>Assyrian,</hi> asserted Earth to be the Principle of all things; <hi>Anaximenes,</hi> Air; <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasus,</hi> Fire; <hi>Xenophanes,</hi> Earth and Water; <hi>Parmenides,</hi> Fire and Earth; <hi>Enopides,</hi> Fire and Air; <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> Atoms; <hi>Empedocles, Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> &amp;c. to these Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples added four Elements, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the visible Matter, as they conceived, of which all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52910:95"/>
did subsist: And this the School-men, following them, have hitherto maintained, and it is now the Doctrine of the World.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chymists</hi> hold Three <note place="margin">Of the 3 Principles of the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists.</hi>
               </note> Principles at this day; these Principles and Elements I now intend to examine: And first, for the Three Principles.</p>
            <p>I know it is no less a crime <note place="margin">Principles.</note> than Heresie, in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Chymists, to deny any of their three beloved Principles, their <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury;</hi> but being not of their Church, I need not fear their Censure. I do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>Salt</hi> in some sence, to be one of their Principles; but


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52910:95"/>
I do deny <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to be several; for their best Authors affirm <hi>Mercury</hi> to be only crude <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> ripe <hi>Mercury;</hi> they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer therefore not in <hi>specie,</hi> but in degree of Digestion.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Ancients (saith <hi>Eirenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us the Great</hi>) thought them all one; and though <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsus</hi> has invented a Liquor, by means whereof, he taught the way of separating the Sulphur in the form of a tincted Metallick Oil; yet I conceive this is nothing but an extraction of the riper, and more digested part of the <hi>Mercury.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This will appear more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by considering the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52910:96"/>
of Metals; which I will deliver in the sence of <hi>Eirenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us the Great,</hi> having translated him, but not having the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal in <hi>Latin</hi> by me.

<q>
                  <p>That <hi>Mercury</hi> (saith he) which is generated in the veins of the Earth, (and all Metals arise from the same Matter) is the universal material Mother of all things cloathed with a Metallick <hi>Species,</hi> which may be easily proved, because <hi>Mercury</hi> is accommodated to them all, and by Art may be conjoyned; which would be impossible unless they did partake of the same Nature. <hi>Mercury,</hi> saith he, is Water, yet such as will mix with nothing that is not of its own Identity; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52910:96"/>
therefore it drinks up all Metals by its moisture, it follows they have all a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency of Matter with it.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Mercury,</hi> by the help of Art assisting Nature, may be successively digested with all the Metals. And this same <hi>Mercury</hi> retaining the same Colour and Form of flowing, will assume the true Nature of them, and by succession exert their true Properties; which would be impossible to be done by Art, did not Nature shew us the possibility by their Correspondency of Matter. Besides, all Metals and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals too, that are of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52910:97"/>
Principles, may be reduced into a current <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Hence I conceive, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that current <hi>Mercury</hi> is the nighest (though not the first) Matter of Metals; which <hi>Mercury</hi> hath a Salt included in it, and becomes a more or less ripe Metal, according to the purity or impurity of its Matrix. What need then can there be of Sulphur as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Principle? But they that contend that these three, <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> are the constituent Principles of a Metallick Body, ought to shew that Nature produces these three simple Substances, and then unites them in the


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52910:97"/>
composition of a Metal. But who ever yet saw a Specifick Metalline Salt void of <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>Sulphur?</hi> Or simple <hi>Mercury</hi> without Salt, or a Metalline Sulphur by it self?</p>
            <p>The Truth is, in a strict sence there are no other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, but the moist vapor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with vital heat; for these two alone constitute all Bodies. As for the Salts I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the generation of Plants and Metals, I conceive them to be only a congelation of a former Vapor, differenced in Metals by a long circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Alembick, of the Earth; and in Plants, by a speedy resolution near the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies.</hi> Now this Homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neity


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52910:98"/>
of Salts in two such dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Bodies, will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear strange to them who consider the vast Alteration Heat makes on Bodies by time, in different Vessels: thus common gross Water, in an open Vessel, by a gentle heat is soon evaporated and rarefied into Air; whilst Dew, a much purer Substance, by the same heat, circulated in a close Vessel by length of time, is condensed into Earth.</p>
            <p>But are not the Principles of Bodies known by their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, <note place="margin">Objection.</note> and may not Metals be reduced into three distinct Principles?</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:52910:98"/>
If the various Figures into <note place="margin">Respons.</note> which the Fire is able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Bodies, must be called Principles, <hi>Monsieur L'Emery</hi> assigns no less than five; but he honestly confesseth, that this is effected by the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Fire makes on Bodies; not by a natural Analysis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their first Principles.</p>
            <p>But does not the <hi>Great Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrite</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Objection.</note> hold three Principles, <hi>Matter, Form</hi> and <hi>Privation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By Privation, he doth not <note place="margin">Respons.</note> mean a Principle, in a strict sence, <hi>i. e.</hi> an Essence consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting a Body, or part of such; but with respect to the previous Matter of each Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, before it is specificated,


<pb n="140" facs="tcp:52910:99"/>
which he calls the <hi>Terminus à quo;</hi> as when determined, the <hi>Terminus ad quem.</hi> But if it must be a Principle, let it be of Death, not of Life: For how can that be a Principle of Life, that is a separation of Soul and Body? If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Privation, he had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it Putrefaction, that might well enough have passed for a Principle, or something like it; since Putrefaction is the Gate to Life.</p>
            <p>I think therefore the Two Principles of the Ancients, <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> stand firm, notwithstanding <hi>Aristotle</hi> or the <hi>Chymists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:52910:99"/>
But if there are four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">Of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> that constitute <hi>Bodies,</hi> according to the general Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, they, I must confess, will overthrow the Two Principles of Matter &amp; Form, unless these Principles being first, the Elements afterwards are made out of them, as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> will have it; and then 'twill be disputing only about Words. But we'll consider this.</p>
            <p>Elements seem to be but modern in respect of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients: <hi>Moses</hi> speaks only of the <hi>Spirit</hi> and the <hi>Abyss;</hi> and so, for what I perceive, it continued even to the Time of <hi>Thales,</hi> who flourished in the 35th <hi>Olympiad;</hi> Principles


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:52910:100"/>
and Elements, being not then distinguished by him; for which <hi>Plutarch</hi> finds fault with him. The same Author makes <hi>Empedocles</hi> to hold Four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who, 'tis said, was a Disciple of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> who was contemporary with <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.</hi> Here I will suppose E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements to begin; the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son this; They that held four Elements, perceiving that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the moist Vapour, and heavenly Influence, or Fire and Water in the modern Language, there were Earth and Air; that Air is the Food, and as it were, the Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Fire, and Water of Earth, and that things generated in the Earth, could not but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of its Nature, as the <hi>Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>


               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:52910:100"/>
in the Womb. That two of these were active, and two passive; two heavy, and two light; must of necessity be those Parts of Matter, that constitute the Harmony of each Being.</p>
            <p>To speak clearly to this Matter, I shall take each Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment apart, and by that you will see, whether these four, or two only, are self-subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beings; Pure, Simple, Primitive, and Unmixt, which is the Notion of an Element. I will begin with the Air.</p>
            <p>That the Air we walk in, <note place="margin">Of the Air.</note> is pure and unmixt, no one will pretend; for the Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Steams, that are sublimed


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:52910:101"/>
into the Air, and the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Moisture fluctuating in this Region, shew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, what we call Air, is nothing but Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rarefied, attracted by the Heat of the Sun, or sublim'd by the <hi>Archeus</hi> of the Earth; and this may be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by many several Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as the evaporating of Water into Smoak (which is a gross Air,) or calcin'd <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> that will attract it, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve it into Water.</p>
            <p>The Earth can never be <note place="margin">Of the Earth.</note> said to be pure, simple, or unmix'd; for it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Shop of Nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in


<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52910:101"/>
bodies of all sorts and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities do reside. It is in truth, nothing more than the grosser parts of the Waters, which condensing into a body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Settlement of the Waters, which God after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards caused to become dry, by the removal of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from it, and the Spirit of Light shining on it.</p>
            <p>Though it is said, <hi>In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning God created the Heaven and the Earth;</hi> yet this is by a Figure <gap reason="foreign">

A Primitive in Nature, a middle Substance, whose one Extream constituted Earth, and its other Air or Heaven.

            <p>Fire, in its Original, is an <note place="margin">Of Fire.</note> emanation of a Solar Spirit,

its Rays darting downwards, impregnate and enkindle Passive Matter, into Motion and Vegetation. It is the Life or Spirit of the World, as Water is the Matter. To doubt this a Principle or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (for I think it no Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, under <hi>Plutarch's</hi> Favour, to make them <hi>Synonyma's,</hi>) were a mortal Sin in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</p>
            <p>Having said this, 'tis easie to infer, That Water is the passive Principle, and the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Influence, the Formal of all created Beings; and that, properly speaking, these two are the only Principles, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Ancients, and the other two only Deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:52910:103"/>
But does not the excellent —, a Learned <hi>Magus,</hi> tell us, That <hi>the Four Elements by their never ceasing Motion, cast forth a Sperm, or subtil Portion of Matter, into the Earth, where meeting, and uniting, it is digest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and brought to perfection, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the purity or impurity of the place?</hi> The Authority of this Person, and the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Admiration I have for him, as it makes me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his Name, so it does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most make me blush to lift up my Pen against him. — <hi>Sed magis Amica Veritas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Four Elements go to the Constitution of each Being, these Elements must be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately united: Now that


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52910:103"/>
cannot be, unless the purest part of one Element enter <hi>per minima,</hi> the purest part of the other. But Earth cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Water <hi>per minima,</hi> unless it be reduced to the Form and Tenuity of Water, and then what need is there of Earth, if Earth must be first resolved into Water, ere it can unite with it? Again, Water must be rarefied to the dignity of Air, or else it cannot unite intimately with Air; if so, what need is there of Water, since Water must become Air before it can assist in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of a Body?</p>
            <p>It to me therefore seems most plain, that all created <hi>Beings</hi> here below, are a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52910:104"/>
of Water, the purest part whereof being rarefied, and impregnated with a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Heat, (which is all the Element of Fire I know of,) is digested into the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous works of Nature, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sified now, according to what Nature has wrought in the Matrix, before the Form en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; for the Form is as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of divers effects, as the Water is susceptible of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Thus much for the Second, <hi>Viz. Principles</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, I shall compare some <hi>Aristotelian Hypotheses</hi> with those of <hi>Democritus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:52910:104"/>
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Heraclitus</hi> too, held the <hi>Elements</hi> to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to each other; as, <hi>Fire</hi> to <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Earth</hi> to <hi>Air,</hi> two active and two passive Principles; but <hi>Democritus</hi> denies it; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, that the Agent and Patient must be in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure alike, otherwise they cannot act upon one another. Wherein <hi>Democritus</hi> is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the right; for Fire and Water differ not in a remiss, but intense degree: witness the quiet resting of Iron (in which the Fire of Nature dwells plentifully) in Water; and witness the Generation of Animals in water, which cannot be done without heat, and witness the Seeds of all Beings (whose germinating


<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52910:105"/>
Virtue, is the Fire of Nature) involved in Moisture.</p>
            <p>There is, in truth, no more difference between these two, than between Water and Plants; of which, the one is so far from being repugnant to the other, that the Plant is nourished by the water; yet when the water is raised to an <hi>Acid,</hi> and the Plant redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to an <hi>Alkali,</hi> by the union of these two, a violent ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition is caused, a controversie even unto Death.</p>
            <p>As for the Cause of the variety of <hi>Bodies,</hi> the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his Followers, and <hi>Leucippus, Democritus</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:52910:105"/>
their Followers, is no less; and 'tis no wonder that they who differ in the Nature of their Principles, should fall out in the effects they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Aristotelians</hi> impute the effects of <hi>Bodies</hi> to secret primary Qualities, residing in them, by the conjunction of the Elements; and so under the Mask of Qualities, which they could not tell what to make of, couch all ignorance of <hi>Bodies,</hi> their Causes, if not Effects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Democritus,</hi> and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, impute nothing to Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, but all to Figure and Motion, called the <hi>Atomical Physiology.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:52910:106"/>
For my part, I think nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Opinion right; yet a middle between both may be true. I shall consider both Opinions, and then give my Reasons against both, and for the middle one. As for the <hi>Pyrrhonian</hi> Doctrine of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, 'tis too trifling to merit an Answer.</p>
            <p>I might introduce this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion with a great deal of pomp, and shew that it hath been a Controversie in the world for above Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Years; that it hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised the greatest Men, and that it is not yet determined. But I shall think my self hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py enough, if I can put an end to this Debate, without


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52910:106"/>
any other consideration. The Method I propose to take, I think, differs from those that have gone before me; for I intend to speak of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the First Matter, and Universal Form, and shew how from the various Union of these Two, various Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities arise. But it would be too Magisterial to reject Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, without shewing their Mistakes: I shall therefore endeavour to shew the Error of these two Parties, and then substitute what I conceive more true.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Aristotelian;</hi> that of Occult Qualities, 'tis <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum per Ignotius;</hi> a thing is hot or cold, bitter or sweet,


<pb n="156" facs="tcp:52910:107"/>
because of some Quality in it; and what is that Quality? 'Tis Occult, that is in plain English, 'tis so, because it is so.</p>
            <p>But the most that can be made of this Notion of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, may amount to this, That there is a Form, or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Principle latent, or occult in all Bodies, that not only retains and keeps the Parts together (be the <hi>Genus</hi> or <hi>Species</hi> what it will) and so distributes it self to all the Members, performing the Office of Life, but is the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Formal Cause of all those Qualities, with which Bodies abound; be they those of Sweet, Bitter, Sharp, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>


               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:52910:107"/>
or Hot and Cold in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral degrees. Which Form being a Vital Principle, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, (and therefore oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,) as <hi>Lucretius</hi> holds.</p>
            <q>
               <lg>
                  <l>Ex insensilibus ne credas sensile gigni,</l>
                  <l>Nimirum Lapides &amp; Ligna, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>'Of things unseen things visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are made,</l>
                  <l>'As Stones, and Wood, and all things that do fade.</l>
               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>But this, I conceive, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be; for though <hi>Galtruchius</hi> tells us in justification of this Doctrine, That there is an actual Modification, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Form to the Matter; I would fain


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52910:108"/>
know what particular Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can a Form have, that enters passive Matter? Where can it receive, before it enters Matter, such a Specification? For notwithstanding what <hi>Pliny</hi> saith of the Planet <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> that she scatters a Proli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Dew, which is but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and what the Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers say of the particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of each Planet; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to know, who can distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the Influences of <hi>Saturn</hi> from <hi>Jupiter; Mars</hi> from <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and so of the rest, except that of <hi>Sol?</hi> The Sun indeed melts Wax, but hardens Clay; but this diversity of effect proceeds from the difference of the Object, not of the Agent; for the Agent is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52910:108"/>
one and the same, tho' varied according to the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Matter that receives it.</p>
            <p>'Tis not therefore the Form alone that gives, or is the Quality in the Body; for as the Body was scatter'd Atoms loose and insipid, till its parts being collected, constituted, by virtue of the Form, a mixt Body; so was its Form sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and undetermin'd, till bound down, and tied to the Body.</p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>Atomical Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siology</hi> of <hi>Leucippus, Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> which is now called the New, by what Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure I know not. How can meer Matter, which in it self,


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52910:109"/>
loose and scattered, is insipid, <hi>i. e.</hi> in its parts hath no Taste, (<hi>for what Taste have the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Bodies of Atoms, void of Qualities?</hi>) when put together by the clinging of its Atoms, the emanation of its Particles, (or imagine what other way you please) acquire a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Taste, or give a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Odor? <hi>Nil dat quod non habet,</hi> may hold well enough here. That which it had not in its Parts, it can never have in the whole; (I speak of the same undetermin'd Matter; for I know that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of different Natures, when conjoyn'd, obtain Qualities by Fermentation, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had a part;) besides if Atoms by their Position and


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52910:109"/>
Figure, or by the manner of the flowing forth of their Particles, do give a Taste and Smell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> these Atoms are so very small, that the Body, though separated into many Parts, yet must retain not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Figure of the Atoms, the Atoms being too minute to have their Angles and Points cut off by a small division of the Body; and consequently the Parts of the Body, must have the same Taste and Odor, when divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as before, if the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are perceived by the Organs of Taste and Smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, be wholly owing to Matter, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the figuration of the Atoms.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:52910:110"/>
But this daily Experience evinces the contrary; for Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies divided, or but a little opened, as Plants and Fruit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> lose in a little time both their Taste and Smell, and yet no one can say, that the points or angles of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms were disfigured, or the Emanation of their Particles obstructed, since great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions were left untouched.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Galtruchius</hi> affirms, <q>Matter to be previously di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed to such a Form, by a Temperament of Qualities.</q> But how can this be? Are not Qualities the Effect of Life in every Body, what needs there then a Form where there is Life before? The


<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52910:110"/>
Qualities therefore of Odor and Taste cannot proceed from the configuration of the Atoms.</p>
            <p>Now if neither the Form gives the Quality of it self; for the Form, as I have shewn before, is simple, a vital Air undetermin'd; nor the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Matter, though Atomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, as I have shewn here; and yet all Bodies have Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, they must proceed from the Union of both, and not from any distinct Cause in either. So the Spirit of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre and Salt Armoniack apart, have no Qualities or Power to dissolve, or rather corrode Gold, but united, do it effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually.</p>
            <p n="4">

               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:52910:111"/>
4. This brings me to the Fourth and last Thing I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to speak to; and that is, How the Earth comes to be filled with variety of <hi>Bodies,</hi> abounding with different qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
            <p>Since I propose here to treat of the Original of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, I must, of necessity speak of the First Matter, and its Formation; and that leads me naturally to consider the first Creation; which I shall do as briefly as possibly I can.</p>
            <p>I shall not cite the various Opinions of the several Sects of Philosophers that treat of the World's beginning, (tho'


<pb n="165" facs="tcp:52910:111"/>
some thought it had none,) this would look more like Shew, than Use, which I have no Temptation to do, since I write for Pleasure, not for Bread. Besides, for Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy's sake, I shall omit it; for there is nothing so foolish, which some of them have not said. Nor shall I borrow Parts of the Many, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> did, to patch up a New one of my own. Nor shall I speak of the Creation any farther than as it relates to my present purpose. But herein I will take the Philosopher <hi>Moses</hi> for my Guide, who, exclusive of his Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, has given a wiser Account of the World's Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, than the whole Body


<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52910:112"/>
of Philosophers put together; whose Writings the most Learned Bishop <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> has defended in his <hi>Origines Sacrae,</hi> against all the World.</p>
            <p>God having created the <note place="margin">Of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</note> First Matter, which seems to be a thin, fluid Substance, an Abyss of Fume or Vapour, rather than Water, which was therefore the more pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive and tenuous, fit to be stretched out for the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Heaven, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any Form; he gave a Form fit to actuate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate this Matter, which was to be the vital Principle of this Body. This general Form was a Spirit of Light and Heat, and so are all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52910:112"/>
Forms now, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore capable of being the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of God, (not the Third <note n="a" place="margin">'Tis an usual <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braism</hi> to impute se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Causes to the first. This distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of First and Second Causes, was found out first by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who taught the World to speak Scholastically; but the <hi>Jews</hi> made them all one; which indeed, in a large sence they are; for <hi>the world is the Lord's, and all things therein.</hi> And therefore <hi>I saiah,</hi> c. 40. v. 8. saith, <hi>The Grass withereth, the Flower fadeth, because the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it.</hi> As the World is God's, and all the Spirits in it, and Parts of it, so indeed this may be said to be the Spirit of the Lord, in point of Property, but not of Identity. Can any one think that this Spirit that blows on the Grass, (or take it Metaphorically, for Man,) is the Holy Ghost? <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius</hi> translate the Words <hi>Spiritus Jehovae,</hi> the appropriate Name of the <hi>Eternal;</hi> yet in their Commentary say, 'tis not <hi>Regenitus Spiritus Sanctificationis in Christo;</hi> which, if they had remembred, they would not have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the <hi>Spiritus Dei,</hi> Gen. 1. <hi>Spiritus Sanctus, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia illa Persona Deitatis, à Deo Patre &amp; Filio procedens.</hi> But they have, I must acknowledge, not a few Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators on their side; though I conceive, the <hi>Jews</hi> never dreamed of such an Interpretation: they might believe it some <hi>Vis, Potentia,</hi> or <hi>Emanatio Dei,</hi> but not the Divine Nature himself, which it is disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to imagine was <hi>incubans superficiei Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> brooding over the Waters, as a Hen does o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her Eggs. This piece of Mechanism may be suitable to Man, or some created Power; but the Almighty <hi>Fiat</hi> is worthy only of God. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this Conjecture, the Original will bear it; for the Learned say that <hi>Ruach</hi> signisies not only <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> but <hi>Ventus, Voluntas, Angulus, Pars, &amp; Plaga.</hi> And therefore <hi>R.

            <p>This will appear more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <note place="margin">The Second Day.</note> by considering the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Day's Work, and that was the making of a <hi>Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or Expansion, which was to <hi>divide the Waters from the Waters, (i. e.)</hi> the Waters that resided with the Globe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, not only from the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52910:114"/>
Bodies, which were advanc'd above, whose ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Principle was Water; but even from the lower part of this Aery Region, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence of Watery Clouds. The manner of which, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive was thus by the Will of the most High.</p>
            <p>This Active Spirit of Light surrounding the moist Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour on all sides, drove it down lower throughout the Aery Region, and thereby compress'd this tenuous Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, into a more close and narrow compass, whence it became condensed into a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery Substance. The Vapour thus condensed into Water, and thus compress'd on all sides, flying from the Fiery


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52910:114"/>
Spirit, as from an Enemy, became still more congeal'd, whose Centre being the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Waters, became Mud or Earth. And this was the Second Day's Work.</p>
            <p>This Fiery Spirit, by the <note place="margin">The Third Day.</note> Will of God, acting upon the Waters, divided the same, so that the Waters being rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led off on each side, the Mud or Earthy Substance appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which by the <hi>Medium</hi> of the Form was made dry, and impregnated with virtue suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the Production of Plants. And this was the Third Day's Operation.</p>
            <p>But on the Fourth Day, <note place="margin">The Fourth Day.</note> the Almighty collected and


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52910:115"/>
pent in this seatter'd Universal Form into the Body of the Sun, whose Virtue being shut up, &amp; comprized in a narrow Compass, was capable of a more intense Emanation, whence followed a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Production.</p>
            <p>So that on the Fifth Day <note place="margin">The Fifth Day.</note> God created Fish and Fowl, by the Union of the Passive Matter, Water, and that of the Form.</p>

Creature <hi>Man,</hi> endowed with a Mind full of Vertue and Holiness, in resemblance to the Divine Nature, (not to speak of his Knowledge and Wisdom,) and made him Lord of all. Were I not here in Publick, I could not forbear a Rapture of Praise to the Almighty Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the World, for his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Munificence to Man, in the mighty Priviledges and Endowments of his Nature. <hi>Sed quod palàm non decet, clàm fiat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having here given a short Abridgment of the Creation, I shall proceed to shew how the Earth comes to be filled with variety of Bodies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52910:116"/>
with different Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. The Consideration of this, will take in Plants, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, and all Fossils.</p>
            <p>As for Plants, we find them mention'd in the 3d Day's ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and that they included their own Seeds, according to their several <hi>Species:</hi> So that from hence it seems that all Plants, being created from the beginning, had for their continuance a Seed infused, that <hi>might be</hi> the Future Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of raising the like; I say, <hi>might be;</hi> for that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, I have already shewed, that Plants may be generated of all sorts, without the sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Specifick seed, by the Power of the Form, and


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:52910:116"/>
the predisposition which the Solar Influx has previously wrought on Passive Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>But now it remains we give an account how the Earth comes to be altered by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Influx; or in the Words above, how the Earth comes to be filled with variety of Bodies, abounding with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Qualities.</p>
            <p>I suppose the Earth and Waters, in the first Creation, had no Qualities but the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of Cold and Moist, and after the Waters were rolled off, and the dry Land appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, those that then were, were latent in the Plants which

God created, which were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>Superficies.</hi> A weak Light, and a faint Form being sufficient for the Production of these, so that the inner parts of the Earth were still simple and undetermin'd.</p>
            <p>But God having shut up this scatter'd and wandring Light, on the Fourth Day, into the Body of the Sun, it became thence a powerful and universal Form or Spirit to this simple or general Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which wheeling about this Globe of Earth and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters continually, and darting into it on all sides Rays of Light and Heat, must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity fill the Earth with Heat and Spirit.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:52910:117"/>
This vital Heat still being multiplied and increased by the Influx of more, and this Form moving in its Sphere, by mixing with the Waters, and arising by Sublimation with them, what with the Rays flowing in, and the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours by subliming to the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies</hi> of the Earth, expiring; must of necessity work on the Passive Matter, the Earth, through which they pass, and according to the Plenty or Scarcity of the Form, cause diversity of Qualities in it; for the warm Vapour still pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies the place where it passes; but where it is stopp'd, before purification of the Place, an abortive or imperfect Thing is made.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:52910:118"/>
Thus <hi>Mercury</hi> determined to a Metallick <hi>Species,</hi> for want of sufficient Heat in the Matrix, becomes an Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. And thus the Earth, wrought upon variously to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Superficies,</hi> by the Intension or Remission of the warm Vapour, though in a most minute degree, must produce a different Salt, and thence a different Plant, as the least Stroak of a Pencil makes a different Face.</p>
            <p>This will appear more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, when we consider that the various parts of the world are productive of different and appropriated Plants and Metals, which can be owing to nothing, but the various


<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52910:118"/>
information of the Matter, which proceeds from the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or remoter access of the Parent of all Forms, the Sun, differenced under the same Meridian; as I shall shew hereafter.</p>
            <p>'Tis easie to observe how Fire alters Matter, though determined, both in Figure and Quality: Thus a Culi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Fire, moderately appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Fruit, Flesh, or Plants, by boiling, baking, or roast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, causes a Taste quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what an intense Heat, or over-boiling, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or roasting occasions</p>
            <p>Thus the most Learned <hi>Metallinists</hi> affirm of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52910:119"/>
of Metals, that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> is produc'd of the moist Vapour adhering to Places impure and cold; <hi>Venus,</hi> of that Vapour in a Matrix im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and hot; <hi>Sol,</hi> in a Place pure and hot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of these Matters, I conceive, <hi>Des Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> has spoke but meanly; for he makes the diversity of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals to arise from the different Magnitude and Figure of their three Principles, which is a Notion borrowed of <hi>Epicurus.</hi> But he acknowledges in this Matter his want of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for he tells us, <q>
                  <hi>Quae fortasse singula descripsissem hoc in loco, si varia Experimenta, quae ad certam eorum cognitionem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiruntur, facere hactenus licuis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set.</hi> These Matters (saith he,)


<pb n="181" facs="tcp:52910:119"/>
I would have described par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in this place, if I had had an opportunity of making some Experiments, which are necessary to the exact knowledge of them.</q> But I believe he had the Philosopher's Fortune, as well as Wit; so that</p>

            <p>'Tis not from the Configu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Metalline Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that Metals vary, but


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:52910:120"/>
by how much the Place is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purated, the Metal becomes more excellent, as I have shewed before. Besides the three imaginary Principles of Metals, were never yet seen distinctly produced by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore no such various Configuration is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of various Metals.</p>
            <p>The same Reason holds for all sorts of Fossils; so that the Terrestrial Heat, flowing from the Central Parts of the Earth, (which some Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers call the Terrestrial Sun, others the <hi>Archeus</hi> of Nature) and the Celestial flowing from the Sun (being both alike,) continually into the Earth, do there meet and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,


<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52910:120"/>
and what from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition of moist Vapours, arising from some Marish Places, that hinders the Solar Influx, from the Inundation of Waters into the Bowels of the Earth, in other places; the compactness of the Earth, that represses the ascending Vapours <note n="a" place="margin">I am confirmed the more in this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by an Iron Mine which I saw at <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> whose Vein running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three Miles, was stopt at a hard Rock; for this Rocky Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour.</note>, in others; the loosness in others, that gives way to it, arises all that vast variety of Bodies abounding with different Qualities, which we behold by digging in the Earth, and see in Plants in the <hi>Superficies.</hi> And this Alteration, that is, Remission or Intension of Heat in the Vapour, gives that variety of Form to the Leaves of Plants, scarce one Leaf in the same


<pb n="184" facs="tcp:52910:121"/>
Plant, being in all parts like another.</p>
            <p>This will appear more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, by considering, that the permanent Matter of all Bodies is Salt, and the Form, a Portion of Light. And for the Salt, it is much the same in all Bodies, when stript of its specificated Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and the Form differs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in degree than kind in all Bodies, as is apparent to them, who are acquainted with the Analysis of Bodies.</p>
            <p>But after all, I have not <note place="margin">Conclusion.</note> the vanity to think, that all that I have said, will obtain with the Reader: The Minds of most Men stand bent, and


<pb n="185" facs="tcp:52910:121"/>
inclin'd to the Pedantry of their Profession and Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; not one Man in ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand is other than what he learn'd from his Tutor or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; for though God has giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us large and free Faculties, yet we suffer our selves to be bow'd down to Principles and Notions, without examining them with Freedom and Judgment. This is evident from the Societies of Men, who always follow their Founder through blind and ignorant Zeal.</p>
            <p>Against this, I cannot but commend <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <hi>Plato,</hi> even whilst he taught him: By which, I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mean, he examined the


<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52910:122"/>
Food before it went down. But our Palates are so vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that we can taste nothing but what we are used to.</p>
            <p>Therefore I do not expect that they who have never looked into <hi>Natural Philosophy,</hi> or have but just made an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, should imbibe what I have offered; I have not writ to such, having only given Hints, not a System of Philosophy.</p>
            <p>There are Principles and Elements in all Sciences, that are first to be learned; there are such Difficulties in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as well as Knowledge, that what afterwards will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear plain and evident, at first


<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52910:122"/>
sight, seems to raw and crude Understandings, repugnant and contrary to Truth. 'Tis no wonder therefore that <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> taught, That the first Business of Man, was to free the Mind from Pollution and Prejudice, without which Freedom, none can perceive aright. Then the Seeds of Knowledge and Truth are to be inserted, then the Mind becomes new, has new Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, new Passions, is dead (almost without a Metaphor) to the former Life, and alive to Vertue and Philosophy. In this Soil the Tares and the Wheat will not grow toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <q>For Philosophy (saith <hi>Hierocles</hi>) is the Perfection of Humane Life, restoring


<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52910:123"/>
it to the Divine Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance. Vertue and Truth, effect this; the former sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing Excess of Passions, the latter inducing the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Form.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Mind of Man must be always filled with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what; here Nature abhors a <hi>Vacuum;</hi> and the warmer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man's Constitution, the more active his Spirit. So that he who takes no care to fill his Mind with moderate Knowledge of God and his Works, to be able from thence to entertain himself with pleasing Thoughts, will give our great Enemy an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to attack him when idle; with whom to parly, is to be undone.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:52910:123"/>
How have I known Men lost, in seeking for Game with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, meerly for want of a good Stock within! Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no Treasure like that of the Mind.</p>
            <p>But you will say, May not a Man's Business, and the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the World entertain him? Nature requires a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax of Drudgery; The Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation-Moments undo Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; not knowing how, wisely to fill up those Spaces, runs us into Miseries, hardly to be retrieved. But a Mind filled with Knowledge and Vertue, is a Fountain of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Light, has Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication night and day with Heaven, and has Raptures of


<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52910:124"/>
Pleasure, which this lower World knows nothing of.</p>
            <p>Here the crafty Politician is at a loss; here the greedy Merchant hath no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; here the subtil Casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist is puzled; the Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the Ambitious, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, the Lascivious, the Dull, the Sowre, and the Base, of these things have no Gust or Relish: To these I may say, as the Herald us'd to do at the Pagan Sacrifices; <hi>Procul este Profani.</hi> For the Wise and the Humble, the Modest and the Vertuous move only in this elevated Sphere.
