         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

&amp; who hath not seene some lofty conceites, towring very high, &amp; coying themselues sweetly on their owne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting winges, young feathers of old Icarus. The gay Peacocke is woondrously inamored vpon the glittering fanne of his owne gorgious taile, and weeneth himselfe worthy to be crowned the Prince of byrdes, and to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thronished in the chaire of supreme excellency. Would Christ, the greene Popiniay, with his newfangled iestes, as new, as Newgate, were not asmuch to say, as his owne Idoll. Queint wittes must haue a Priuiledge to prank-vp their dainty limmes, &amp; to fawne vpon their owne tricksie deuises. But they that vnpartially know themselues; seuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examine their owne abilities; vprightly counterpoise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes with sufficiencies; frankly confesse, the greatest part of their knowledge, to be the least part of their ignorance; aduisedly weigh the difficulties of the painfull and toyle-someway, the hard maintenance of credit easely gotten, the impossible satisfaction of vnsatisfiable expectation, the vncertaine ficklenesse of priuate Phantasie, &amp; the certaine brittlenesse of publique Fame; are not lightly bewitched with a fonde doting vpon their owne plumes. And they that deepely consider vpon the weakenesse of inward frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the casualtie of outward fortune, the detraction of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, the virulency of Malice, the counter-pollicy of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and a hundred-hundred empeachments of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reputation: that aswell diuinely, as philosophically haue learned to looue the gentlenesse of Humanity, to embrace the mildnesse of Modestie, to kisse the meekenesse of Humilitie, to loath the odiousnesse of Pride, to assuage the egrenesse of Spite, to preuent the vengeance of Harred, to reape the sweet fruites of Temperance, to tread the smooth Path of Securitie, to take the firme course of Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce,
<pb facs="tcp:4081:4"/>
and to enioy the felicitie of Contentment: that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciously haue framed themselues to carry Mindes, like their Bodies, and Fortunes, as apperteineth vnto them, that would be loth to ouerreach in presumptuous conceit: they I say, and all they that would rather vnderly the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche of obscuritie, then ouercharge their mediocritie with an illusiue opinion of extraordinary furniture, and I wott not what imaginarie complementes; are readier, and a thousand times readier to returne the greatest Prayses, where they are debt, then to accept the meanest, where they are almes. And I could nominate some, that in effect make thesame reckoning of Letters, Sonets, Orations, or other writinges commendatory, that they do of meate without nourishment, of hearbes without vertue, of plants without fruite; of a lampe without oyle, a linke without light, or a fier without heate. Onely some of vs are not so deuoide of good manner, but we conceiue what belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to ciuill duty, and will euer be prest to interteine Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie with curtesie, &amp; to requite any frendship with frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: vnfainedly desirous, rather to recompense in deedes; then to glose, or paint in wordes. You may easely persuade me to publish, that was long sithence finished in writing, and is now almost dispatched in Print: (the amendes must be addressed in some other more materiall Treatise, or more formall Discourse: and haply <hi>Nashes S. Fame</hi> may supply some defectes of Pierces Supererogation): but to suffer your thrise-affectionate Letters, and Sonets, or rather your thrise-lauish beneuolences to be published, which so farre surmount not onely the mediocrity of my present endeuour, but euen the possibility of any my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture emproouement; I could not be persuaded by any elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or importunacy in the world, were I not as mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strously
<pb facs="tcp:4081:4"/>
reuiled by some other without reason, as I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiuely extolled by you without cause. In which case he may seeme to a discreet enemy excusable, to an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent frend iustifiable, that is not transported with his owne passion, but relyeth on the iudgement of the learnedest, and referreth himselfe to the Practise of the wisest. In the one, esteeming <hi>Plutarch,</hi> or <hi>Homer,</hi> as an hundred Autors: in the other Valuing <hi>Cato,</hi> or <hi>Scipio,</hi> as a thousand Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. I neuer read, or heard of any respectiue, or conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate person, vnder the degree of those, that might reuenge at pleasure, contemne with autority, assecure themselues from common obloquy, or commande publique reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (mighty men may finde it a Pollicy, to take a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or extraordinary course), so carelesse of his owne cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit; so recklesse of the present time, so senselesse of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, so negligent in occurrents of consequence, so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute in his proceedings, so prodigall of his name, so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide of all regarde, so bereft of common sense, so vilely base, or so hugely hawtie of minde; that in case of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous imputation, or vnworthy reproch, notoriously scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered-abroad, thought it not requisite, or rather necessary, to stand vpon his owne defence according to Equity, and euen to labour his owne commendation according to the presented occasion. Discourses yeeld plenty of Reasons: and Histories affourde store of Examples. It is no vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory to permit with consideration, that abused Modesty hath affected with discretion. It is vanity to controwle, that true honour hath practised: and folly to condemne, that right wisedome hath allowed. If any dislike Immodesty indeede, despise vanity indeede, reprooue Arrogancy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, or loath Vainglory indeede; I am as forward with Tongue, and Hart, as the foremost of the forwardest: and
<pb facs="tcp:4081:5"/>
were my pen aunswereable, perhaps at occasion it should not greatly lagge behinde. To accomplish, or aduaunce any vertuous purpose, (sith it is now enforced to be stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring) it might easely be entreated, euen to the vttermost extent of that little-little Possibility, wherewith it hath pleased the Greatest to endowe it. Howbeit Curtesie is as ready to ouerloade with prayse; as Malice eger to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw with reproch. Both ouershoote, as the manner is; but malice is the Diuell. For my poore part, I hope the One shall do me as little harme, as fayre weather in my ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: I am suer, the other hath done me more good, then was intended, and shall neuer puddle or annoy the course of the cleere running water. Albeit I haue studied much, and learned little: yet I haue learned to gleane some ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dfulls of corne out-of the rankest cockle: to make choice of the most fragrant flowers of <hi>Humanitie,</hi> the most vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hearbes of <hi>Philosophie,</hi> the most soueraine fruites of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement,</hi> and the most heauenly manna of <hi>Diuinitie:</hi> to be acquainted with the fayrest, prouided for the fowlest, delighted with the temperatest, pleased with the meanest, and contented with all <hi>weather.</hi> Greater men may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, and can atchieue greater matters; I thanke God, I know the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, that is, the shortnes of mine owne foote.

either all, or the worst of all, I could still vow Silence in brawles, and would still professe Patience in wronges: (I hate brawles with my hart: and can turne-ouer A volume of wronges with a wett finger:) but some cunning men, that carry hoony in their mouthes, and gall in their hartes, not so sweete in the Premisses, as bitter in the Conclusion, can smoothly, and finely descant vpon the least aduantage, howsoeuer iniurious: and certaine pretty Experiences, by way of sensible instruction, haue taught some, that Malice was neuer such an hypocrite, as now; and the world neuer such a Scoggin, as now; &amp; the Diuell neuer such a knaue, as now: &amp; what a desperate dissolutenesse were it in him, that regardeth his good name, to abandon himselfe, or to relinquish the deerest thing in this life, (I know no deerer thing, then honest credite) to the fauour of Enuy, or to the discretion of Fortune?

I could yet take pleasure, and proffite, in canuassing some Problems of naturall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, of the Mathematiques, of Geography, and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drography, of other commodious experimentes, fit to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce many valorous actions: and I would vppon mine owne charges, trauaile into any parte of Europe, to heare some pregnant Paradoxes, and certaine singular questions
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4081:12"/>
in the highest professions of Learning, in Physick, in Law, in Diuinity, effectually and thoroughly disputed <hi>pro, &amp; contra:</hi> and would thinke my trauaile as aduauntageously bestowed to some purposes of importance, as they that haue aduenturously discouered new-found Landes, or brauely surprized Indies. What conferences, or disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, what Parliaments, or Councels, like those, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate vpon the best gouernement of Commonwealthes, and the best discipline of Churches; the dubble anchor of the mighty shipp, and the two great Luminaries of the world? Other extrauagant discourses, not materiall, or quarrelous contentions, not auaileable, are but wastinge of winde, or blotting of paper. What should Exercise, or studdy, burne the Sunne, or the candle in vaine? or what should I doe against my selfe, in speakinge for my selfe, if outward respectes did not inwardly gripe, and a present exigence lay violent handes vpon me? Though extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be powerable, yet an vnwilling will is excusable. Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, and Lawyers can best argue the case of inuolunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry actes: but what so forcible, as compulsion: or so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, as a passiue action? Blame him not, or blame him gently, that would be a little loth, to be dieted at the racke of the old Asse, or to be bitten of the young dog. He is no party in the cause, that pleadeth thus against <hi>Aristogiton.</hi> Sweet Gentlemen, imagine it to be a speech, addressed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your selues. <hi>Peraduenture the viper did neuer bite any of you; and the Gods forbid, it should euer bite you: but when you espie any such pernicious creature, you presently dispatch it: in like manner when you behold a Sycophant, and a man of a vipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous nature, looke not till he hath bitten some of you, but so soone as he starteth-vp, pull him downe.</hi> And againe in an other place of the same sententious, and politique Oration: <hi>Hee</hi>

                  <hi>that mainetayneth a Sycophant, is by nature and kinde an enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the good: vnlesse some-body imagine, that the seede and roote of a naughty Sycophant ought to remaine in the Citty, as it were for store, or good husbandry. Demosthenes</hi> was as deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wise, as highly eloquent: and hath many such notable sentences, as it were Caueats, or Prouisoes, against the daungerous ennemies of that flourishing Citty, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially against Calumniatours, whose viperous sting hee could by no meanes avoide: albeit otherwise such an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, as could allure heartes with perswasion, or coniure mindes with astonishment. I would no other Citty loued figges: or must an other Citty of necessity loue figges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is growne an other Athens, a mother of eloquence, a nurse of learning, a grandame of valour, a seat of honor, and as Aristotle termed Athens, a garden of Alcinous, wherein one fruite ripeneth vpon an other, one peare vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon an other, one grape vpon an other, and one figge vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon an other. The Sycophant be his owne interpreter: &amp; if he may be licensed, or permitted to bee his owne caruer too, much good may it doe him, and sweete digestion geue him ioy of his dainety figg. I must haue a little care of one, that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not easily brucke vnreasonable sawcinesse: &amp; would be loth to see the garden of Alcinous made the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Greene, or Motley. It was wont to be said by way of a Prouerbe; Hee that will be made a sheepe, shall find wolues inough: but forsooth this exceeding-wise world, is a great Asse-maker: and he that will suffer himselfe to be proclaimed an Asse in printe, shall bee sure neuer to want loade and loade inough. Who so ready to call her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, a skold, as the rankest skold of the parish: or who so forward to accuse, to debase, to reuile, to crow-treade an other, as the arrantest fellow in a country? Let his owne

mouth be his pasport, or his owne penne his warrant: &amp; who so leawd as his greatest aduersary, modesty: or so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, as his deerest frend, villany: or so learned, as his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedest counsell, vanity: or so wise, as his profoundest Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, young Apuleius. What familiar spirite of the Ayre, or fire, like the glibb, &amp; nimble witt of young Apuleius? or where is the Eloquence, that should describe the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perfections of young Apuleius? Prudence, may bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, discretion; Logique, arguments; Rhetorique, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; Phantasy, conceites; Steele, an edge; and Gold, a luster, of young Apuleius. O the rare, and queint Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ô the gallant, and gorgeous Elocution: ô the braue, and admirable amplifications: ó the artificiall, and fine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuations: ô the liuely pourtraitures of egregious pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and disprayses: ô the cunning, and straunge mingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mangles: ô the pithy iestes, and maruelous girdes of yong Apuleius: the very prodigality of Art, and Nature. What greater impossibility, then to decipher the high, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty stile of young Apuleius, without a liberall portion of the same eleuate spirite? Happy the old father, that begat; and thrise happy the sweete Muses, that suckled, and foste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red young Apuleius. Till Admiration hath found-out a smoother, and tricksier quill for the purpose: Desire must be content to leaue the supple and tidy constitution of his omni-sufficient Witt, vndisplayed. Onely it becommeth gentle mindes to yeeld themselues thanckefull; and to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their bounden duety to that inestimable pearle of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, for this precious glimze of his incomprehensible valour; one shorte Maxime, but more worth, then all the Axioms of Aristotle; or the Idees of Plato; or the Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismes of Hippocrates; or the Paragraphes of luftinian. He knoweth not to manage his penne, that was not born with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4081:14"/>
an Affe in his mouth; a foole in his throate; and a knaue in his whole body. Simple men may write against other, or pleade for themselues: but they cannot confute cuttingly, like a hackster of Queen-Hith, or bellow lustely, like the foreman of the Heard. I goe not about to discouer an Asse in an Oxes hide: hee needeth no other to pull him by the famous eares, that is so hasty to descry, and so busy to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirre his wisest partes. but what a notable Asse indeede was I, that sought the winges of a mounting Pegasus, or a stying Phenix, where I found the head, &amp; feete of a bray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creature? Some promises, are desperate debtes: and many threatninges, empty cloudes; or rather armies figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the ayre, terrible visions. Simplicity cannot dubble: and plaine dealing will not dissemble. I looked either for a fine-witted man, as quicke as quick-siluer, that with a nimble dexterity of liuely conceite, and exquisite secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryship, would out-runne mee many hundred miles in the course of his dainty deuises; a delicate minion: or some terrible bombarder of tearmes, as wilde as wildfire, that at the first flash of his fury, would leaue me thunder-stricken vpon the ground, or at the last volley of his outrage, would batter me to dust, and ashes. A redoubted aduersary. But the trimine silke-worme, I looked-for, (as it were in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per contempt of common finenesse) prooueth but a silly glow-woorme: and the dreadfull enginer of phrases, in steede of thunderboltes, shooteth nothing but dogboltes, and catboltes, and the homeliest boltes of rude folly.

they are like the renowmed Lobbelinus, when hee had gotten a new coate: and take vpon them, without pitty, or mercy, like the onely Lordes of the field. If euer Esquier raued with conceit of his new Armes, it is Danters gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: that mightily despiseth, whatsoeuer hee beholdeth from the high turret of his creast, and cranckly spitteth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the heads of some, that were not greatly acquaynted with such familiar enterteinement. His best frende, be his Iudge: and I appeale to my worst ennemy, whether he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer read a more pestilent example of prostituted Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency? Were hee not a kinseman of the foresayd viper, a Dog in malice, a Calfe in witt, an Oxe in learning, and an Asse in discretion: (time shall cronicle him, as he is:) was it possible, that any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should haue bestowed some broad, and loud tearmes, as he hath done? Who could abide it, without actuall reuenge, but hee, that enterteineth spite with a smile, maketh a pastime of Straunge Newes; tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth choler into sanguine, vineger into wine, vexation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sport; and hath a salue for a greater sore?</p>

your selues: such a new-deuised modell, as neuer saw Sun before, &amp; may make the gayest mold of antiquity to blush. Old Archilochus, and Theon, were but botchers in their rayling faculty: Stesichorus, but a grose bungler: Aristar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus but a curious, and nice foole: Aristophanes and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, but merry iesters: Ibis against Ouid; Meuius against Horace; Carbilius Pictor against Virgill; Lauinius against Terence; Crateua against Euripides; Zoilus against Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but rancke fowters. Salust did but dally with Tully: Demades but toy with Demosthenes: Pericles but sporte with Thucy dides, and so foorth. For examples are infinite; and no exercise more auncient, then Iambiques amongst Poetes; Inuectiues amongst Oratours; Confutations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Philosophers; Satyres amongst Carpers; Libels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst factioners; Pasquils amongst Malcontentes; and quarrells amongst all. But the Olde Age was an Infante in Witt, and a Grammer Scholler in Arte: Lucians Rhetor, neuer so brauely furnished, will be heard with an Eccho: Iulian will rattle Christendome: Arrius will shake the Church: Macchiauell will yerke the Commonwealth: Vnico Aretino will scourge Princes: and heere is a lusty ladd of the Castell, that will binde Beares, and ride golden Asses to death. Were the pith of courage lost, it might be founde in his penne: or were the marrow of conceite to seeke, where should witt looke for witt, but in his Incke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottle? Arte was a Dunse, till Hee was a writer: and the quickest Confuter, a drowsy dreamer, till he put a life into the dead quill, &amp; a flye into the woodden boxe of forlome Pandora. A pointe for the Satyrist, whose conceite is not a Ruffian in folio: and a figg for the Confuter, that is not a Swashbucler with his pen. Old whimwhams haue plod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded-on, long enough: fresh inuention from the tapp, must

Giue me the fellow, that is as Peerelesse, as Pennylesse; and can oppose all the Libraries in Poules Churchyard, with one wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full work of Supererogation; such an vnmatcheable peece of Learning, as no bookes can counteruaile, but his owne; the onely recordes of the singularities of this age. Did I speake at a venture, I might deceiue, and be deceiued: but where Experience is a witnesse, and iudgement the Iudge, I hope the errour will not be vnreasonably great.</p>
               <p>There was a time, when I floted in a sea of encountring waues; and deuoured many famous confutations, with an eager, and insatiable appetite: especially Aristotle against Plato, and the old Philosophers: diuers excellent Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistes, indued with rare, &amp; diuine wittes, (of whome else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where at large,) Iustinus Martyr, Philoponus, Valla, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, Ramus, against Aristotle: oh but the great maister of the schooles, and high Chauncellour of Vniuersities, could not want pregnant defence: Perionius, Gallandius, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentarius, Sceggius, Lieblerus against Ramus: what? hath the royall Professour of Eloquence, and Philosophy, no fauourites? Talaeus, Ossatus, Freigius, Minos, Rodingus, Scribonius, for Ramus against them; and so foorth, in that hott contradictory course of Logique, and Philosophy. But alas silly men, simple Aristotle, more simple Ramus, most simple the rest, either ye neuer knew, what a sharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged, &amp; cutting Consutation meant: or the date of your stale oppositions is expired; and a new-found land of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing commodities discouered, by this braue Columbus of tearmes, and this onely marchant venturer of quarrels; that detecteth new Indies of Inuention, &amp; hath the winds of Aeolus at commaundement. Happy, you flourishinge
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4081:16"/>
youthes, that follow his incomparable learned steps: and vnhappy we old Dunses, that wanted such a worthy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of all nimble and liuely dexterities. What should I appeale infinite other to their perpetuall shame: or sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon such, and such to their foule disgrace? Erasmus in Latine, and Sir Thomas More in English, were supposed fine, and pleasant Confuters in their time, and were accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly embraced of the forwardest and trimmest wittes: but alacke how vnlike this dainty minion? Agrippa was reputed a gyant in confutation; a demi-god in omnisuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of knowledge; a diuell in the practise of horrible Artes: oh, but Agrippa was an vrcheon, Copernicus a shrimpe, Cardan a puppy, Scaliger a baby, Paracelsus a scab, Erastus a patch, Sigonius a toy, Cuiacius a bable to this Termagant; that fighteth not with simple wordes, but with dubble swordes: not with the trickling water of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon, but with piercing Aqua fortis: not with the sorry powder of Experience, but with terrible gunpowder: not with the small shott of contention, but with the maine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce of fury. For breuity I ouerskip many notable men, and valorous Confuters in their seuerall vaines: had not affection otherwhiles swinged their reason, where rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son should haue swayed their affection. But Partiality, was euer the busiest Actour; and Passion, the whottest Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: whatsoeuer plausible cause otherwise pretended: and hee is rather to bee esteemed an Angell, then a man, or a man of Heauen, not of Earth, that tendereth integrity in his hart; equity in his tounge; and reason in his penne. Flesh, and bloud are fraile Creatures, and partiall discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers: but he approacheth neerest vnto God, &amp; yeeldeth sweetest fruite of a diuine disposition, that is not transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with wrath, or any blinde passion, but guided with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4081:16"/>
cleere, and pure Reason, the soueraigne principle of sound proceeding. It is not the Affirmatiue, or Negatiue of the writer, but the trueth of the matter written, that carryeth meat in the mouth, and victory in the hande. There is nothing so exceeding foolish, but hath beene defended by some wise man: nor any thinge so passinge wise, but hath bene confuted by some foole. Mans will, no safe rule, as Aristotle sayth: good Homer sometime sleepeth: S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine was not ashamed of his retractations: S. Barnard saw not all thinges: and the best chart may eftsoones ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw. He that taketh a Confutation in hand, must bringe the standard of Iudgement with him; &amp; make Wisedome the moderatour of Wit. But I might aswell haue ouerpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the censure, as the persons: &amp; I haue to do with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that valueth both alike, and can phansy no Autor, but his owne phansy. It is neyther reason, nor rime, nor witt, nor arte, nor any imitation, that hee regardeth: hee hath builded towers of Superarrogation in his owne head, and they must stand, whosoeuer fall. Howbeit I cannot ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slipp some without manifest iniury, that deserue to haue their names enrolled in the first rancke of valiant Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: worthy men, but subiect to imperfections, to errour, to mutuall reproofe; some more, some lesse, as the manner is. Harding, and Iewell, were our Eschines, and Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes: and scarsely any language in the Christian world, hath affoorded a payre of aduersaries, equiualent to Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and Iewell; two thundring and lightning Oratours in diuinity: but now at last infinitely ouermatched by this hideous thunderbolt in humanity, that hath the onely right tearmes inuectiue, and triumpheth ouer all the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Contradiction. You that haue read Luther against the Pope: Sadolet, Longolius, Omphalius, Osorius, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:4081:17"/>
Luther: Caluin against Sadolet: Melanchthon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Longolius: Sturmius against Omphalius: Haddon against Osorius: Baldwin againste Caluin: Beza againste Baldwin: Erastus against Beza: Trauers against Erastus: Sutcliff against Trauers: and so foorth: (for there is no ende of endlesse controuersies: nor Bellarmine shall euer satisfye the Protestantes: nor Whittaker contente the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes: nor Bancroft appease the Precisians: nor any reason pacify affection: nor any authority resolue obstinacy:) you that haue most diligently read these, and these, and sundry other, reputed excellente in their kindes, cast them all away, and read him alone: that can schoole them all in their tearmes inuectiue, and teacheth a new-found Arte of confuting, his all-onely Arte. Martin himselfe but a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocke: and Papp-hatchet himselfe but a milkesop to him: that inditeth with a penne of fury, and the incke of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; and hath cart-loades of papershot, and chainshot at commaundement. Tush, no man can blason his Armes, but himselfe. Behold the mighty Champion, the dubble sword-bearer, the redowtable fighter with both handes, that hath robbed William Conquerour of his surname, and in the very first page of his Straunge Newes, choppeth-off the head of foure Letters at a blow. Hee it is, that hath it rightly in him indeede; and can roundly doe the feate, with a witnesse. Why, man, he is worth a thousand of these pidlinge and driblinge Confuters, that sitt all day buzzing vpon a blunt point, or two: and with much adoe drisle-out as many sentences in a weeke, as he will powre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downe in an howre. It is not long, since the goodlyest graces of the most-noble Commonwealthes vpon Earth, Eloquence in speech, and Ciuility in manners, arriued in these remote parts of the world: it was a happy reuolution
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:4081:17"/>
of the heauens, and worthy to be chronicled in an English Liuy, when Tiberis flowed into the Thames; Athens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued to London; pure Italy, and fine Greece planted themselues in rich England; Apollo with his delicate troupe of Muses, forsooke his old mountaines, and riuers; and frequented a new Parnassus, and an other Helicon, nothinge inferiour to the olde, when they were most-so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely haunted of diuine wittes, that taught Rhetorique to speake with applause, and Poetry to sing with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But euen since that flourishing transplantation of the daintiest, and sweetest lerning, that humanitie euer tasted; Arte did but springe in such, as Sir Iohn Cheeke, and M. Ascham: &amp; witt budd in such, as Sir Phillip Sidney, &amp; M. Spencer; which were but the violetes of March, or the Primeroses of May: till the one begane to sprowte in M. Robart Greene, as in a sweating Impe of the euer-greene Laurell; the other to blossome in M. Pierce Pennilesse, as in the riche garden of pore Adonis: both to growe to perfection, in M. Thomas Nashe; whose prime is a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest, whose Arte a misterie, whose witt a miracle, whose stile the onely life of the presse, and the very hart-blood of the Grape. There was a kind of smooth, and clenly, and neate, and fine elegancy before: (proper men, handsome giftes:) but alacke, nothinge liuelie, and mightie, like the braue <hi>vino de monte,</hi> till his frisking penne began to playe the Sprite of the buttry, and to teach his mother-tongue such lusty gambolds, as may make the gallantest French, Italian, or Spanish gagliards to blushe, for extreame shame of their ideot simplicitie. The difference of wittes is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding straung, and almost incredible. Good lord, how may one man passe a thousand, and a thousande not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with one? Arte may giue out precepts, and directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes

in <hi>communi forma:</hi> but it is superexcellent witt, that is the mother pearle of precious Inuention; and the goul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den mine of gorgeous Elocution. Na, it is a certaine preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and liuely thing without name, but a queint mistery of mounting conceit, as it were a knacke of dexterity, or the nippitaty of the nappiest grape, that infinitly surpasseth all the Inuention, and Elocution in the world; and will bunge Demosthenes owne mouth with new-fangled fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of the right stampe, maugre all the thundering, and lightninge Periodes of his eloquentest orations, forlorne creatures. I haue had some prettie triall of the finest Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canisme in graine; and haue curiously obserued the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningest experiments, and brauest complements of aspiring emulation: but must geeue the bell of singularity, to the humorous witt; and the garland of victory, to the <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niering Eloquence.</hi> I come not yet to the Praise of the olde Asse: it is young Apuleius, that feedeth vpon this glory: and hauing enclosed these rancke commons, to the proper vse of himselfe, &amp; the capricious flocke; adopteth whom he listeth, without exception: as Alexander the great, had a huge intention, to haue all men his subiectes, and all his subiectes called Alexanders. It was strange newes for some, to be so assesied: and a worke of Supererogation for him, so bountifully to voutchsafe his golden name: the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate cognisance of his noble stile. God-night poore Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torique of sorry bookes: adieu good old Humanity: gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Artes, and Liberall Sciences content your selues: Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well my deere moothers, sometime floorishing Vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: some that haue long continued your sonnes in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; your apprentises in Arte; your seruauntes in Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise; your louers in affection; and your vassalles in duety: must either take their leaues of their sweetest freendes; or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4081:18"/>
become the slaues of that dominiering eloquence, that knoweth no Art but the cutting Arte; nor acknowledgeth any schoole, but the Curtisan schoole. The rest is pure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, or wondrous supernaturall. Would it were not an infectious bane, or an incroching pocke. Let me not bee mistaken by sinister construction, that wreasteth and wrig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth euery sillable to the worst. I haue no reference to my selfe; but to my superiours by incomparable degrees. To be a Ciceronian, is a flowting stocke: poore Homer, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wight, may put his finger in a hole, or in his blind eye: the excellentest histories, and woorthiest Chronicles, (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable monumentes of wisdome, and valour,) what but stale Antickes? the flowers, and fruites of delicate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, that were wont to be dainetily and tenderly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, now preserued with dust, as it were with sugar, and with hoare, as it were with hoony.

Titles, and tearmes are but woordes of course: the right fellow, that beareth a braine, can knocke twenty ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles on the head, at a stroke; and with a iugling shift of that same inuincible knacke, defende himselfe manfully at the Paper-barre. Though I be not greatly employed, yet my leisure will scarsely serue, to moralize Fables of Beares, Apes, and Foxes: (some men can giue a shrewd gesse at a courtly allegory:) but where Lordes in expresse tearmes are magnifically contemned, Doctours in the same stile may be courageously confuted. Liberty of Tounge, and Pen, is no Bondman: nippitaty will not be tied to a post: there is a cap of mainetenaunce, called Impudency: and what say to him, that in a superabundaunce of that same odd capricious humour, findeth <hi>no such want in England, as of an Aretine, that might stripp these golden Asses out-of their gay trappinges, and after he had ridden them to death with ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, leaue them on the dunghill for carrion?</hi> A frolicke mind, and a braue spirite to bee employed with his stripping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, in supply of that onely want of a diuine Aretine, the great rider of golden Asses.

Reason hath an euen hande, and dispenseth to euerye one his right: Arte amplifieth, or extenuateth at occasion: the residue, is the liberality of the pen, or the poyson of the inke: in Logique, Sophistrie; in law, iniury; in historie, a fable; in diuinity, a lye. Horace, a sharpe, and sententious Poet, after his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy manner, comprizeth much in fewe wordes:

               <p>As for his lewd supposals, &amp; imputations of counterfait praises, without anye probability of circumstance, or the least suspition, but in his owne vengeable malitious head, the common forge of pestilent surmyzes, and arrant slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; they are like my imprisonment in the Fleete of his strong Fantasie, and doe but intimate his owne skill in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifying of euidence, and suborning of witnesses to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: he museth, as he vseth; &amp; the goodwife his mother would neuer haue sought her daughter in the Oouen, if herselfe had not beene well acquainted with such shiftes of cunninge conueiance.

In coniectural causes I am not to auouch any thinge; and I mentioned not anye such supposition before: but the tenour of the style, &amp; as it were the iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titye of the phrase, togither with this newe descant of his profound insight in forgery, may after a sort tel tales out of the tytle <hi>De Secretis non reuelandis;</hi> &amp; yeld a certain strong sauour of a vehement presumption.

I will not offend your stomacke with the nice and queint regiment of the dainty Platonistes, or pure Pythagoreans: fine Theurgy, too-gant and meager a doctrine for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels Oratour: if the Arte Notory, cannot be gotten with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fasting, and praying, muchgoditch-them that haue it: let phantasticall, or superstitious Abstinence, daunce in the aier, like Aristophanes clowdes, or Apuleius witches: your owne method of those deadly sinnes, be your Castell of Health.

but as shallow as Trumpington foorde, and as slight as the newe workemanship of guegawes to please children, or of toys to mocke apes, or of trinketts to conquer sauages.

Petrarckes Inuention, is pure Loue it selfe; and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarckes Elocution, pure Bewty it selfe: his <hi>Laura</hi> was the Daphne of Apollo, not the T hisbe of Pyramus; a deliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sappho, not a lasciuious Lais; a sauing Hester, not a destroying Helena; a nimph of Diana, not a Curtisan of Venus. Aretines muse was an egregious bawd, &amp; a hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gishe witch of Thessalia: but Petrarcks verse, a fine loouer, that learneth of Mercury, to exercise his fayrest giftes in a faire subiect; &amp; teacheth Wit to be inamored vpon Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye: as Quicksiluer embraseth gold; or as vertue affecteth honour; or as Astronomy gazeth vpon heauen; to make Arte more excellent by contemplation of excellentest Nature. Petrarck was a delicate man, and with an elegant iudgement gratiously confined Loue within the limits of Honour; Witt within the boundes of Discretion; Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence within the termes of Ciuility: as not many yeares sithence, an Inglishe Petrarck did, a singular Gentleman, and a sweete Poet; whose verse singeth, as valour might speake; and whose ditty, is an Image of the Sun, voutsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing to represent his glorious face in a clowde. All posterity honour Petrarck, that was the harmony of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; the lyfe of Poetry; the grace of Arte; a precious ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet of rare conceits, &amp; a curious frame of exquisite worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship;

Were the amorous muse of my enemy, such aliuely Spring of sweetest flowers, &amp; such a liuing Haruest of ripest fruits: I would abandon other loues, to dote vpon that most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louely muse; and would debase the Dyamant in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of that most Dyamant muse. But out-vpon ranke, &amp; lothsome ribaldry, that putrifieth, where it should purify, and presumeth to deflowre the moste florishinge wittes, with whom it consorteth, eyther in familiarity, or by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour. One Ouid was too-much for Roome; and one Greene too-much for London: but one Nashe more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable then both: not bicause his witt is anye thinge comparable, but bicause his will is more outragious. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raria could scarcely brooke Manardus, a poysonous Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian: Mantua hardly beare Pomponatius, a poysonous Philosopher: Florence more hardly tollerate Macchiauel, a poysonous politician: Venice most hardly endure Arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, a poysonous ribald: had they liued in absolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, they would haue seemed vtterly insupportable. Germany, Denmarke, Sweden, Polony, Boemia, Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Moscouy, are noe soiles of any such wittes: but neither Fraunce, nor Spaine, nor Turky, nor any puissant king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in one, or other Monarchy of the old, or new world, could euer abide any such pernicious writers, deprauers of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon discipline. Ingland, since it was Ingla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, neuer bred more honorable mindes, more aduenturous hartes, more valoroushandes, or more excellent wittes, then of-late: it is enough for Filly-folly to intoxicate it selfe, though it be not suffered to defyle the lande, which the water enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, the Earth enritcheth, the aier ensweeteneth, and the Heauen blesseth.

to be fostred: wantonnesse wilbe a nurse, a bawde, a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, a Legend to itselfe: vertue hath much-a doe to hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inuiolably her purposed course: Resolution is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fellow, and Valour a braue man; but affections are infections, and appetite must sometime haue his swinge. Were Appetite a loyall subiect to Reason, and Will an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate seruant to Wisdom; as Labour is a dutifull vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal to Commodity, and Trauail a flying post to Honour; ô heauens, what exploites of worth, or rather what miracles of excellency, might be atcheeued in an age of Pollicy, &amp; a world of Industry. The date of idle vanityes is expired: awaye with these scribling paltryes: there is an other Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta in hande, that indeede requireth Spartan Temperance, Spartan Frugality, Spartan exercise, Spartan valiancye, Spartan perseuerance, Spartan inuincibility: and hath no wanton leasure for the Comedyes of Athens; nor anye bawdy howers for the songes of Priapus, or the rymes of Nashe. Had he begun to Aretinize, when Elderton be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ballat, Gascoine to sonnet, Turberuile to madrigal, Drant to versify, or Tarleton to extemporise; some parte of his phantasticall bibble-bables, and capricious panges, might haue bene tollerated in a greene, and wild youth: but the winde is chaunged, &amp; there is a busier pageant vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the stage.

When Alexander in his conquerous expeditions visited the ruines of Troy, and reuolued in his minde the valiant actes of the Heroicall Woorthies there atchieued; One offered to bring his Maiesty, the Harpe of Paris: Let it alone, quoth hee, it is the Harpe of Achilles, that must serue my turne. Paris vppon his harpe, sang voluptuous, &amp; lasciuious Carols: Achilles harpe was an instrument of glory, and a quier of diuine Hymnes, consecrated to the honour of valorous Captaines, and mighty Conquerours. He regarded not the dainety Lydian, Iônian, or Aeolian Melody: but the braue Dorian, and impetuous Phrygian Musique: and waged Zenophantus to inflame and enrage his courage with the furious notes of Battail. One Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was a thousand Examples of Prowesse: but Pyrrhus, the redoubted king of the Epirots, was an other Alexander in tempestuous execution: and in a most-noble resolution contemned the Vanities of vnnoble Pastimes: in so much that, when one of his Barons asked his Maiestie, whether of the twoo Musitians, Charisius, or Python, pleased his Highnesse better: Whether of the two, quoth Pyrrhus; marry Polysperces shall go for my money.

And thinking vpon worthy M. Asteley, I cannot ouerpasse the like labour of good M.

In a manner the onely Poet, whome Vrany hath voutsafed to Laureate with her owne heauenly hand: and worthy to bee alleadged of Diuines, and Counsellours, as Homer is quoted of Philosophers, &amp; Oratours. Many of his solemne verses, are oracles: &amp; one Bartas, that is, one French Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, more weighty in stern, and mighty counsell, then the Seauen Sages of Greece. Neuer more beauty in vulgar Languages: but his stile ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth fauour, and grace to beauty; and in a goodly Boddy representeth a puissant Soule. How few verses carry such a personage of state? or how few argumentes, such a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of maiesty? Or where is the diuine instincte, that can sufficiently commend such a volume of celestiall inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?

Happy plants, that speedily shew-foorth their generous nature: and a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne good possesseth those worthy mindes, that suffer not their affections to be inueigled, or entangled with any vnworthy thought. Great Excercises become great perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages: as the Magnes approoueth his Nobility in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding Iron, and taming the Sea: baser, or meaner pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes belong vnto meaner Persons; as Iett discouereth his gentry, in drawing chaffe, haires, and such trifles.

But when we began to renue our old

Nothing, but pure Mammaday, and a fewe morsels of fly-blowne Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phuisme, somewhat nicely minced for puling stomackes. But there be Painters enough, though I goe roundly to worke: and it is my onely purpose, to speake to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.

               <p>It was Martins folly, to begin that cutting vaine: some others ouersight, to continue it: and doubble V<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. triumph, to set it agogg.

Especially in Ecclesiasticall causes: where it goeth hard, when Scoggin, the Iouiall foole, or Skelton the Malancholy foole, or Elderton the bibbing foole, or Will Sommer the chollericke foole, must play the feate; and Church-matters cannot bee discussed without rancke scurrillity, and as it were a Synode of Diapason fooles. Some few haue a ciuill pleasant vaine, and a daine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty splene without scandale: some such percase might haue repayed the Marr-prelate home to good purpose: other obscenity, or vanity confuteth itselfe, and impeacheth the cause.

though Browne were a foole: &amp; Papp-hatchet be honest, though Barrow be a knaue: it is not your heauing, or hoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing coile, that buildeth-vpp the walles of the Temple. Alas poore miserable desolate most-woefull Church, had it no other builders, but such architects of their owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies, and such maisons of infinite contradiction. Time, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by secrcte intelligence, or resolued by curious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scouery, spareth no cost, or trauaile, to preuent Mischiefe: but employeth her two woorthy Generals, Knowledge, &amp; Industry, to cleere the coast of vagarant errours in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and to scoure the sea of rouing conuptions in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline. Roome was not reared-vpp in one day; nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pulled downe in one day. A perfect Ecclesiasticall Discipline, or autentique Pollicy of the Church, (that may auowe, I haue neither more, nor lesse, then enough; but iust the nomber, weight, and measure of exact gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) is not the worke of One man whosoeuer, or of one age whatsoeuer: it requireth an incredible-great iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: exceeding-much reading in Ecclesiastical histories, Councels, Decrees, Lawes: long, and ripe practise in Church-causes. Platformes offer themselues to euery wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king conceit; and a few Tables, or Abridgements are soone dispatched: but, whatsoeuer pretext may coulerably bee alledged, vndoubtedly they attempt, they know not what, and enterprise aboue the possibility of their reach, that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they can in a Pamflet, or two, contriue such an omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient, and incorruptible Method of Ecclesiasticall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, as could not by any priuate meditation, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike occasion be found-out, with the studdy, or practise of fifteene hundred yeeres. I am not to dispute, as a professed Deuine; or to determine, as a seuere Consour: but a schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler may deliuer his opinion with reason; and a frend may
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4081:48"/>
lend his aduise at occasion: especially when hee is vrged to speake, or suspected for silence. They must licence mee to dissent from them, that autorise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to disagree from fo many notable, and woorthy men, in the common repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of so long a space. They condemne superstitious, &amp; credulous simplicity: it were a fond simplicity to defende it, where it swarueth from the Trueth, or strayeth out of the way: but discretion can as little commend opiniotiue and preiudicate assertions, that striue for a needelesse, and daungerous Innouation. It is neither the Excesse, nor the Defect, but the Meane, that edifyeth. Superstition, and Credulitie, are simple Creatures: but what are Contempt, and Tumult? What is the principall cause of this whole Numantine Warre, but affectation of Nouelty, without ground? If all without exception, from the very schollers of the Primitiue, and heroical schoole, wanted knowledge, or zeale: how rare, and singular are their blessinges, that haue both, in so plentifull, and incomparable measure? As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly there were many excellent witts, illuminate minds, and deuout soules before them: if nothing matchable with them, what greater Maruell in this age? Or if they were not rightly disciplined, that liued so Vertuously, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianly togither; what an inestimable treasure is founde, &amp; what a cleere fountaine of holy life? Where are godly minds become, that they embrace not that sacred societie? What aile Religious handes, that they stay from building<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpp the Cittie of God? Can Platos Republique, and Mores Vtopia winne hartes: and cannot the heauenly Hierusalem conquer soules? Can there be a greater impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, then to hinder the rearing-vp of those celestiall walles? why forgetteth the grose Church, that it ought to be the pure kingdome of heauen? To zeale, euen speede is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay;

and a yeare, an age. But how maturely, and iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously some busie motions haue bene considered-vpon by their hoat sollicitours, it would not passe vnexamined. A strong Discipline standeth not vpon feeble feete: and a weake foundation will neuer beare the weight of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Hierusalem. The great shoulders of Atlas oftentimes shrinke and saint vnder the great burden of heauen. The Tabernacle of Moses; the Temple of Salomon; the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Age of the Primitiue Church; and the siluer regiment of Constantine, would be looked-into, with a sharper, and cleerer eye. The difference of Commonwealthes, or regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, requireth a difference oflawes, and orders: and those lawes, and orders are most souerain, that are most agreable to the regiment, and best proportioned to the Commonwealth. The matter of Elections, and offices, is a principall matter in question: and how many not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant, or curious, but learned, and considerate wits, haue lost themselues, and founde errour, in the discourse of that subiect? But how compendiously might it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that is so infinitly argued; or how quietly decided, that is so tumultuously debated? I relye not vpon the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie of disputable rules; or the subtilitie of intricate arguments; or the ambiguitie of doubtfull allegations; or the casualtie of fallible experiments: but grounde my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution vpon the assurance of such politique, and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Principles, as in my opinion can neither be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued grosely, nor deceiue dangerously. Popular Elections, and offices, aswell in Churches, as in Commonwealthes, are for popular states: Monarchies, and Aristocraties, are to celebrate their elections, and offices, according to their forme of gouernement, and the best correspondence of their states, Ciuill, and Ecclesiasticall: and may iustifie

their good proceeding by good diuinitie. As they graue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and religiously prooued, that in the florishing propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and mightie encrease of the Catholique Church vnder Princes, before, in, and after the Empire of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine, were driuen to varie from some primitiue Exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples: not by vnlawfull corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as is ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly surmised; but by lawfull prouisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, according to the exigence of occasions, &amp; necessitie of alteration in those ouerruling cases: as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by pregnant euidence of Ecclesiasticall histories, and Canons; wherewith they are to consult, that affect a deepe insight in the decisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of such controuersies; &amp; not to leape at all aduentures, before they haue looked about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, aswell backward, as forward, &amp; aswell of the one side, as of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Consideration, is a good Counsellour: &amp; Reading, no badd Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brancer; especially, in the most essentiall Common-places of Doctrine, and the most important matters of Gouernement. Ignorance may someway be the father ofZeale, as it was wont to be termed the moother of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion: but blind men swallow-downe many flyes; and none more, then many of them, that imagin they know all, and conceit an absolute omnisufficiencie in their owne platformes, with an vniuersall contempt of whatsoeuer contradiction, speciall, or generall, moderne, or auncient: when vndoubtedly they are to seeke in a thousand points of requisite, and necessarie consideration. Lord, that men should so please, and flatter themselues in their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises: as if none had eyes, but they. God neuer bestowed his diuine giftes in vayne: they are not so lightly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, that so grauely demeaned themselues, instructed their brethren, reclaimed infidels, conuerted countryes, planted Churches, confounded Heretiques, and inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly trauailed in Gods causes, with the whole deuotion
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:4081:50"/>
of their soules: howsoeuer some can be content to thinke, that since the Apostles, none euer had the spirit of Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, or the mindes of sincerity, but themselues. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me pure intelligences, and incorruptible mindes. The auncient Fathers, and Doctors of the Church, wanted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learning, nor iudgement, nor conscience, nor zeale: as some of their Greeke, and Latine woorkes very notably declare: (if they were blinde, happy men that see:) and what wiser Senates, or hollyer Congregations, or any way more reuerend assemblies, then some Generall, and some Prouinciall Councels? Where they to a superficiall opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, seeme to sett-vp a Glosse, against, or beside the Text; it would bee considered, what their considerations were; and whether it can appeare, that they directly, or indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceeded without a respectiue regard of the Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or a tender care of the Church, or a reuerend exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of that Text. For I pray God, we loue the Text no worse, from the bottome of our hartes, then some of them did. They are not the simplest, or dissolutest men, that thinke, Discretion might haue leaue to cutt his coate according to his cloth; and commend their humility, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, wisdome, and whole conformity, that were ready to accept any requisite order not vnlawfull, and to admitt any decent, or seemely rites of indifferent nature. Put the case, iust as it was then, and in those countries; and what if some suppose, that euen M. Caluin, M. Beza, M. Meluin, or M. Cartwright, (notwithstanding their new deseigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes) being in the same estate, wherein they were then, and in those countries, would haue resolued no otherwise in effect, then they determined. Or if they did not so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly well, I pray God we may. Howbeit none so fitt to reconcile contradictions, or to accord differences, as hee
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4081:50"/>
that distinguisheth Times, Places, Occasions, and other swaying Circumstances; high pointes in gouernement, either Ciuill, or Ecclesiasticall. As in the doubtfull Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs, and Canons of the Law of man; so in the mysticall oracles of the Law of God; <hi>Qui benè distinguit, benè docet:</hi> in the one, when hee vseth no distinction but of the Law, or some reason equipollent to the Law: in the other, when he interpreteth the scripture by the scripture, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly by conference of Text with Text, or collectiuely by the rule of Analogy. In cases indifferent, or arbitrary, what so equall in generall, as Indifferency: or so requisite in speciall, as conformity to the positiue I awe, to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Countrey, or to the present occasion? To be peruerse, or obstinate without necessary cause, is a peeuish folly: when by such a duetyfull, and iustifiable order of proceeding, as by a sacred League, so infinite Variances, and contentions may be compounded. To the cleane, all thinges are cleane. S. Paule, that layed his foundation like a wise architect, and was a singular frame of diuinity, (om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisufficiently furnished to be a Doctour of the Nations, &amp; a Conuertour of People) became all vnto all, and as it were a Christian Mercury, to winne some. Oh, that his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or Zeale were as rife, as his Name: and I would to God, some could learne to behaue themselues toward Princes, and Magistrates, as Paul demeaned himselfe, not onely before the King Agrippa, but also before the twoo Romane Procuratours of that Prouince, Felix, and Festus: whome he entreated in honourable termes, albeit ethnicke gouernours. Were none more scrupulous, then S. Paul, how easily, and gratiously might diuers Confutations bee reconciled, that now rage, like Ciuill Warres? The chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest matter in question, is no article of beliefe, but a point of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4081:51"/>
pollicy, or gouernement: wherein a Iudiciall Equity being duely obserued, what letteth but the particular Lawes, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, Iniunctions, and whole manner of Iurisdiction, may rest in the disposition of Soueraine Autoritie? Whose immediate, or mediate actes, are to be reuerenced with O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, not countermaunded with sedition, or contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with contention. He is a bold subiect, that attempteth to binde the handes of sacred Maiesty: and they loue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies well, I trow, that call their Princes proceedinges into Controuersie. Altercations, and Paradoxes, aswell in Discipline, as in Doctrine, were neuer so curiously curious, or so infinitely infinite: but when all is done, and when In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouation hath sett the best countenance of proofe, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion, vpon the matter; Kingdomes will stand, and Free-Citties must be content. Their Courts, are no Presidents for Royall Courts: their Councels, no instructions for the Councels of Kings, or Queenes: their Consistories, that would master Princes, no informations for the Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries vnder Princes: their Discipline, no Canon, or plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme for soueraine gouernement, either in Causes Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, or Spirituall. And can you blame them, that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, how of all other Tribunals, or benches, that Iewish Synedrion, or Pontificall Consistory should so exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grow in request, that put Christ himselfe to death, and was a whipp for his deerest Apostles? I am loth to enter the listes of argumentation, or discourse, with any obstinate minde, or violent witt, that weeneth his owne Conceit, a cleere Sunne without Eclipse, or a full Moone without wanes: but sith Importunacy will neuer linne molesting Parliaments, and Princes, with Admonitions, Aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Motions, Petitions, Repetitions, Sollicitations, Declamations, Discourses, Methods, Flatteries, Menaces,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4081:51"/>
and all possible instant meanes of enforcing, and extorting the present Practise of their incorruptible Theorie; it would be som-bodies taske, to hold them alittle occupied, till a greater Resolution begin to subscribe, &amp; a surer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision to execute.

All is concluded in afewe pregnant propositions: we shall not neede to trouble, or entangle our wittes with many Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Iniunctions, Statutes, or other ordinances: the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, Prouinciall, and Episcopall Councels, lost much good labour in their Canons, Decrees, and whatsoeuer Ecclesiasticall Constitutions: the workes of the fathers, and Doctours, howsoeuer auncient, learned, or Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall, are little, or nothing worth: infinite studdies, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, commentaries, treatises, conferences, consultations, disputations, distinctions, conclusions of the most-notable Schollers in Christendome, altogither superfluous.

Machiauels Positions: and seing it is prooued a peece of sound doctrine, it must not be gain-sayd. Euery head, that hath a hand, pull-downe the pride of Bishops, and set vp the humilitie of Ministers. Diogenes treade vpon Platos pompe. An vniuersall reformation be proclaimed with the sounde of a Iewes-trumpe: let the Pontificall Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie be erected in euery Parish: let the high Priest, or Archbishop of euery Parish, be enstalled in Moses chaier, (it was Moses, not Aarons Chayer, that they challenge in their Senate: &amp; he must be greater then Hercules, that can fulfill both). let the Ministerie be a Royall Priesthood; and uery Minister within the precinct of his territorie, and the dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his Segniorie, raigne like a Presbiter Iohn: let it euerlastingly be recorded for a souerain Rule, as deare as a Iewes eye, that Iosephus alledgeth out-of the Law; <hi>Nihil agat Rex, sine Pontificis, &amp; Sentorum sententia.</hi> One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let thesayd Pontife beware, he prooue not a great Pope in a little Roome; or discouer not the humour of aspiring Stukely, that would rather be the king of a moulhill, then the second in Ireland, or England.

Euery man must haue his due in his place: and honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liably belongeth to redoubted Seniours. That is their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per title at Geneua. Now if it seeme as cleere a case in Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, as in Diuinitie; that one, and the same Discipline may serue diuers, and contrarie formes of regiment; and be as fitt for the head of England, as for the soote of Geneua: the worst is, Aristotles Politiques must be burned for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques. But how happie is the age, that in stead of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Positiue Lawes, and Lesbian Canons, hath founde one standing Canon of Polycletus, an immutable Law of sacred gouernement? And what a blissefull destinie had the Commonwealth, that must be the Modell of all other Commonwealthes, and the very Center of the Christian world? Let it be so for euer, and euer, if <hi>that Pamflet of the Lawes, and Statutes of Geneua,</hi> aswell concerning Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Discipline, as Ciuill regiment; deserue any such sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, or extraordinarie estimation, either for the one, or for the other. If not; are they not busie men, that will needes beare a rule, and strike a maine stroke, where they haue nothing to doe, or are to be ruled? It were a good hearing in my eare, that some of them could gouerne themselues, but in reasonable wise sort, that are so forward to swey kingdomes, and to swing Churches after their new fashion; and can stande vpon no grounde, but their owne. If certaine of them be godlyer, or learneder, then many other, (according to their fauorablest reputation,) it is the better for them: I would also, they were wiser, then some of them, whom they impugne. Surely I feare, they will be founde more peremptorie in Censure, then sounde in Iudgement; and more smart in reproofe, then sharpe in proofe. And may it not be a probable doubt, how they haue compared togither <hi>the Law</hi> of Gods people, <hi>and the</hi>

                  <hi>Gospell</hi> of Christes Church in the Bible: or how they haue studdied <hi>Iosephus, Philo,</hi> &amp; <hi>Egesippus</hi> of the Iewish affaires; or <hi>Sigonius</hi> of the Hebrue Commonwealth; or <hi>Freigius</hi> his Mosaicus; or their owne <hi>Bonauentura</hi> of the Iudaicall Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy; that fetch their Iurisdiction from the <hi>Sanedrim</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; and ground their Reformation vpon the Iewes <hi>Thalmud,</hi> the next neighbour to the Turkes <hi>Alcoran.</hi> Had <hi>Ramus</hi> Treatise of Discipline come to light; they would long-ere-this haue beene ashamed of their Sanedrim, and haue blushed to foist-in the Thalmud, in steede of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. God helpe poore Discipline, if the water bee like the Conduit, the Oile like the Lampe, and the Plant like the Tree. Abraham was the beginning: Dauid the middest: and Christ the ende of the Hebrue history: his Gospell, not his ennemies Thalmud, the pure fountaine of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and the onely cleere resplendishing Sunne, that giueth light to the starres of heauen, &amp; earth; vnto which the Church, his most deere and sweete spouse, is more deepely, and more incomprehensibly bounden, then the day vnto the Sunne, that shineth from his glistering cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot. It is not for a Pontificall Seniory or a Mechanicall Eldership, to stopp the course of any riuer, that successiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly floweth from that liquid fountaine: or to putt-out any Candle, that was originally lighted at that inextinguible Lampe. The Church hath small cause, to dote vppon the Coosen-germane of Tyranny: and the Commonwealth hath no great affection to the Sworn-brother of Anarchy. Certainely States neede not long to interteine tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and neuer-satisfied Innouation. Good my masters, either make it an euident, and infallible case, without so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisticall wrangling, or personall brawling; that your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced Discipline, not the order approoued, is the

pure well of that diuine Spring, and the cleere light of that heauenly Sunne: or I beseech you, pacifie yourselues, and surcease to endaunger kingdomes with vnneedefull vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rores. Crooked proceedings would be rectified by a right, not a crooked line: and Abuses reformed, not by abuling the persons, but by well-vsing the things the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues.

               <p>Modesty is a Ciuil Vertue, and Humility a Christian quality: surely Martin is too too-malapert, to be discreet; and Barrow too too-hoat, to bee wise: if they bee godly, God help Charity: but in my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they little wot, what a Chaos of disorders, confusions, &amp; absurdities they breed, that sweat to build a reformation in a monarchy, vpon a popular foundation, or a mechanicall plott; &amp; will needes be as fiery in execution, euen to wring the Clubb out-of Hercules hand, as they were aëry in resolution. Alas, that wise men, and reformers of states (I know not a weightier Prouince) should once imagine, to finde it a matter of as light consequence, to seniorise in a realme, ouer the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Lordes, and euen ouer the highnesse of Maiestie; as in a towne, ouer a company of meane marchantes, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner artificers.

Caluin, the founder of the plott, (whome Beza stileth the great Caluin) had reason to establish his ministery against Inconstancy, and to fortify himselfe against Faction, (as he could best deuise, and compasse with the assistance of his French party, and other fauorites) by encroaching vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a mechanicall, and mutinous people, from whose va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable and fickle mutability he could no otherwise assecure himselfe. As he sensibly found not onely by dayly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences of their giddy and factious nature, but also by his owne expulsion, and banishment: whome after a little triall, (as it were for a dainety nouelty, or sly experiment) they could be content to vse as kindly, and loyally, as they had vsed the old Bishopp, their lawfull Prince. Could M. Cartwright, or M. Trauerse seaze vpon such a Citty, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny like popular towne, Heluetian, or other, where Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craty ruleth the rost: they should haue some-bodies good leaue to prouide for their owne fecurity; and to take their best aduauntage vppon tickle Cantons. Some one perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture in time would canton them well-enough; &amp; giue a shrewd pull at a Metropolitan Sea, as soueraine, as the old Bishoprike of Geneua. It were not the first time, that a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocraty by degrees hath prooued an Aristocraty; an Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocraty degenerated into an Oligarchy; an Oligarchy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to a Tyranny, or Principality. No Rhetorique Climax so artificiall, as that Politique Gradation. But in a iust kingdome, where is other good assuraunce for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and meeter Councels for Princes, then such swarmes of imperious Elderships; it is not for subiectes to vsurpe, as Commaunders may tirannise in a small territory. Vnlesse they meane to sett-vp a generall Deformation, in lieu of an Vniuersall Reformation; and to bring-in an order, that would soone prooue a diluge of disorder; an ouerflow of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:4081:55"/>
Anarchy; and an open Fludgate, to drowne Pollicy with licentiousnes, nobility with obscurity, and the honour of realmes with the basenesse of Cantons. They that long for the bane, and plague of their Country, pray for that many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedded, and Cantonish reformation: in issue good for none, but the high Iudges of the Consistory, and their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate Creatures: as I will iustify at large, in case I be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer particularly challenged. I am no pleader for the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the feete ouer the head, or the gouernement of the stomacke ouer the hart: surely nothing can bee more pernitious in practise, or more miserable in conclusion, then a commaunding autority in them, that are borne to obey, ordained to liue in priuate condition, made to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their occupations, and bound to homage. You that be schollars, moderate your inuention with iudgement: and you that be reasonable gentlemen, pacify your selues with reason. If it be an iniury, to enclose Commons; what iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice is it, to lay-open enclosures? and if Monarchies must suffer popular states to enioy their free liberties, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plest fraunchises, without the least instringment, or abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: is there no congruence of reason, that popular states should giue Monarchies leaue, to vse their Positiue lawes, established orders, and Royall Prerogatiues, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance, or confutation? Bicause meaner Ministers, then Lordes, may become a popular Cittie, or territorie, must it therefore be an absurditie in the maiestie of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to haue some Lordes spirituall amongst so many temporall: aswell for the fitter correspondence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of both degrees; their more reuerend priuate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in matters of conscience; their weightier publique Counsell in Parlaments, and Synods; the firmer assurance of the Clergie in their causes; and the more honorable esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:4081:55"/>
of Religion in all respectes: as for the solemner vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation of their Dioces, &amp; other competent Iurisdiction. It is Tyrannie, or vamglorie, not reuerend Lordship, that the Scripture condemneth. There were Bishops, or as some will haue them termed, Superintendents, with Episcopall superioritie, and iurisdiction; in the golden age of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles: <hi>Timothie</hi> of Ephesus; <hi>Titus</hi> of Crete; <hi>Marke</hi> of Alexandria; <hi>Iames</hi> of Ierusalem; <hi>Philemon</hi> of Gaza; the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent <hi>Apollos</hi> of Caesarea; <hi>Euodius</hi> of Antioche; <hi>Sosipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of Iconium, according to Dorotheus, of Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea, according to Origene; <hi>Tychicus</hi> of Chalcedon; <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> of Damascus; and so forth. Diuers of the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Doctours, aswell of the Orientall, as of the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall Churches, were Bishops, reuerend Fathers in Christ, and spirituall Lordes. Thesame stile, or title of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, hath successiuely continued to this age, without any empeachment of value, or contradiction of note; sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that of the angrie Malcontent, and prowd heretique Aërius, scarsely worth the naming. What cruell outrage hath it lately committed, or what haynous indignitie hath it newly admitted, (more then other aduauncementes of Vertue, or stiles of honour,) that it should now be cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or abandoned in all hast? Would God, some were no stouter, or hawtier without the title, then some are with it. Many temporall Lordes, Dukes, Princes, Kinges, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, haue showen very-notable effectuall examples of Christian humilitie: and may not spirituall Lordes carrie spirituall mindes? I hope, they do: I know, some doe: I am suer, all may; notwithstanding their ordinarie title, or an hundred plausible Epithits. I would the Lordship, or pompe of Bishops, were the greatest abuse in Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthes, or Churches. I feare me, I shall neuer liue to see
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:4081:56"/>
so happie a world vpon the Earth, that aduised Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should haue nothing worse to complaine-off, then that Lordship, or pompe. What may be, or is amisse, in any degree; I defend not: (the delict of some one, or two Prelates, were it manifest, ought not to redounde to the damage, or detriment of the Church): what may stande with the honour of the Realme; with the benefite of the Church; with the approbation of antiquitie, and with the Canon of the Scripture, I haue no reason to impugne, or abridge. I haue more cause to suspect, that some earnest dealers might be persuaded to dispense with the name of Lordship in Bishops, on condition, themselues might be the parties: that would not secularlie abuse the title to any priuate pompe, or vanitie, but religiously applie it to the publique administration of the Churche, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the first institution. Were dalliance safe in such cases; I could wishe the experiment in a person, or two, in whose complexions I haue some insight. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour Humfry of Oxford, and Doctour Fulke of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, two of their standard-bearers a long-time, grew conformable in the end, as they grew riper in experience, and sager in iudgement: and why may not such, and such, in the like, or weightier respectes, condescend to a like to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration of matters Adiaphorall? Sith it will be no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, (maugre all Admonitions, or whatsoeuer zealous Motiues) better relent with fauour, then resist in vayne. Were any fayre offer of preferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, handsomely tendered vnto some, that gape not greedily after promotion, nor can-away with thissame seruile waiting, or plausible cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for liuing: I doubt not but wise men would see, what were good for themselues, commodious for their frendes, and conuenient for the Church. If they should obstinatly
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:4081:56"/>
refuse Deaneryes, and Bishoprickes, I should verely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, they are mooued with stronger arguments, and pregnanter autorities, then any, they haue yet published in Print, or vttered in disputation: and I would be very glad to conferre with them, for my instruction. Sound reasons, &amp; autenticall quotations may preuayle much: &amp; no such muincible defence, as the armour of Proofe. In the meane time, the cause may be remembred, that incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the foresayd sactious malcontent, Aërius, to maintaine the equalitie of Bishops, and other Priestes, when himselfe failed in his ambitious suite for a Bishopricke: and all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth vpon a case of conscience, as nice and squeamish a scruple with some zealous Marr-prelates, as whither the Fox in some good respects, might be woon to eate grapes. They that would pregnantly try Conclusions, might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture finde such a temptation, the materiallest and learnedest Confutation, that hath yet bene Imprinted. Melancholie is deepely wise; and Choler resolutely stout: they must persuade them essentially, and feelingly, that will mooue them effectually. Were they entreated to yeelde, other arguments would subscribe of their owne gentle accord; and ingenuously confesse, that Opinion is not to preiudice the Truth, or Faction to derogate from Autoritie. Possession, was euer a strong defendant: and a iust title maketh a puissant aduersarie. Bishops will goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne with reputation, when Marr-Prelats must obey with reuerence, or resist with contumacie. Errours in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; corruptions in manners; and abuses in offices, would be reformed: but degrees of superioritie, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of obedience are needefull in all estates: and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Clergie as necessarie, as the Sunne in the day, or the Moone in the night: or Cock-on-ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

thousand Curates in the world, would prooue a mad Discipline. Let Order be the golden rule of proportion; &amp; I am as forward an Admonitioner, as any Precisian in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. If disorder must be the Discipline, and confusion the Reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, (as without difference of degrees, it must needes) I craue pardon. <hi>Anarchie,</hi> was neuer yet a good States man: and <hi>Ataxie,</hi> will euer be a badd Church-man. Thatsame lustie Downefall, is too-hoat a Pollicie for my learning. They were best, to be content to let Bishopricks stande, that would be loth to see Religion fall, or the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie troden vnder foote. He conceiueth little, that percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not, what bondes hold the world in order, and what tenures maintaine an assurance in estates. Were Ministers Stipendaries, or Pensionars, (which hath also bene a wise motion) and all without distinction, alike esteemed, that is, all without regard, alike contemned, &amp; abiected, (which would be the issue of vnequal Equallity); woe to the poore Ministery: and the cunningest practise of the consistorie, should haue much-adoe, to stopp those gapps, and recure those sores. Neuer a more succourlesse Orphan; or a more desolate widdow; or a more distressed Pilgrim; then such a Ministery: vntill in a thirsty, &amp; hungry zeale, it should eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soones retire to former prouisions, &amp; recoouer that auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Oeconomy Ecclesiasticall. The surest reuenue, &amp; honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest salary of that coate; much-better iwis, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours pay, or the Seruing-ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wages. Equality, in things e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, is a iust Law: but a respectiue valuation of persons, is the rule of Equity: &amp; they little know, into what inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>grui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp; absurdities they runne headlong, that are weary of <hi>Geometricall proportion,</hi> or distributiue Iustice, in the colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of publique functions, offices, or promotions, ciuile, or spirituall. God bestoweth his blessings with difference;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4081:57"/>
and teacheth his Lieutenant the Prince, to estimate, and preferre his subiectes accordingly. When better Autors are alledged for equalitie in persons Vnequall; I will liue, and dye in defence of that equalitie; and honour <hi>Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Proportion,</hi> as the onely ballance of Iustice, and sole standard of gouernement. Meane-while, they that will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be wiser, then God, and their Prince, may continue a pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish scrupulositie in subscribing to their ordinances; and nurrish a rebellious Contumacie, in refusing their orders. I wish vnto my frendes, as vnto miselfe: and recommende Learning to discretion, conceit to iudgment, zeale to knowledge, dutie to obedience, confusion to order, Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie to assurance, and Vnlawfull noueltie to lawfull Vniformitie: the sweetest repose, that the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, or Church can enioy. <hi>Regnum diuisum,</hi> a souerain Text; and what notabler Glosse vpon a thousand Texts?

Parrat; Discipline an Eccho; Reformation a shaddow; Sanctification a dreame without Charitie: in whose sweet boosome Reconciliation harboureth; the dearest frend of the Church, and the onely Est Amen of so infinite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies. That Reconciliation settle itselfe to examine matters barely, without their veales, or habiliments, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the counsell of Marcus Aurelius: and to define thinges simply, without any colours, or embellishments, according to the preceptes of Aristotle, and the examples of Ramus: and the most-endlesse altercations; being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally rather Verball, then reall, and more circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, then substantiall; will soone grow to an ende.

Wrong him not, that would gladly be well-taken, where he meaneth-well; and once for all protesteth, he looueth humanitie with his hart, and reuerenceth diuinitie with his soule: as he would rather declare indeede, then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse in worde. If he erreth, it is for want of knowledge, not for want of Zeale. Howbeit for his fuller contentment, he hath also done his endeuour, to know something on both sides; and laying-aside Partialitie to the persons, hath priuately made the most equall &amp; sincere Analysis of their seuerall allegations, and proofes, that his Logique, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie could sett-downe. For other Analyses he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed, as impertinent, or not specially materiall. After such examination of their autorities, and argumentes, not with a rigorous Censure of either, but with a fauorable Construction of both: Pardon him, though he presume to deliuer some part of his animaduersions in such termes, as the instant occasion presenteth: not for any contentious, or sinister purpose (the world is too-full of litigious, and barratous pennes) but for the satisfaction of those, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire them, &amp; the aduertisement of those, that regard them.

The finest Methodists, according to Aristotles golden rule of artificiall Boundes, condemne Geometricall preceptes in Arithmetique, or Arithmeticall preceptes in Geometrie, as irregular, and abusiue: but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Artist so licentiously heterogenised, or so extrauagant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceeded his prescribed limits, as Ambition, or Cooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Euery Miller is ready to conuey the water to his owne mill: and neither the high Priestes of Ierusalem, nor the Popes of Roome, nor the Patriarkes of Constantinople, nor the Pastors of Geneua, were euer hastie to binde their owne handes.

is a necessarie Bridle in some cases. The first Bishops of Roome, were vndoubtedly vertuous men, and godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors: from Bishops they grew to be Popes: what more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend, then some of those Bishops; or what more Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall, then some of those Popes? Aaron, and the high-Priestes of Ierusalem, and of other ceremoniall nations, were their glorious Mirrours; and they deemed nothing too-magnificall, or pompous, to breede an Vniuersall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence of their sacred autoritie, and Hierarchie. We are so farre alienated from imitating, or allowing them, that we cannot abide our owne Bishops; yet withall would haue euery Minister a Bishop, and would also be fetching a new Patterne from old Ierusalem, the moother-sea of the high-Priesthood. So the world (as the manner is) will needes runne-about in a Circle: pull-downe Bishops; set vp the Minister; make him Bishop of his Parish, and head of the Consistorie, (call him, how you list, that must be his place): what will become of him within a fewe genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but a high Priest in a low Ierusalem, or a great Pope in a small Roome? And then, where is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him, and a Bishop, or rather betweene him, and a Pope? not somuch in the qualitie of his Iurisdiction, when in effect he may be his owne Iudge, as in the quantitie of his Dioces, or temporalties. Or in case he be Politique; as some Popes haue bene glad for their aduantage, to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nise Popularly, so he may chaunce be content for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement, to popularise tyrannically: and shall not be the first of the Clergie, that hath cunningly done it with a comely grace. Something there must be of a Monarchie in free states: and something there will be of free states, in a Monarchie. The discreeter, and Vprighter the Curate is, the more circumspectly he will walke, and degenerate the

lesse. Yet what generation without degeneration: or what reuolution without irregularitie? One inconuenience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth an other: enormities grow like euill weedes: take heede of a mischiefe: and where then will be the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Or how shall defection, (acknowledging no prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or superioritie in any person, or Court) retire to his first institution: if percase there should growe a Conspiracie in fellowship; one Consistory iustifie an other for aduantage; and their whole Synods fall-out in consequence, to be like their Parts? Men may erre: and frailtie will slipp. What should I alledge Historyes, or autorities? It is no newes for infirmitie to fall, when it should stand; or for appetite to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, when it should obey. Euery sonne of Adam, a reed shaken with the wind of passion, a weake Vessell, a Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of imperfection, a Master of ignorance, a Doctour of errour, a Pastour of concupiscence, a superintendent of auarice, a Lord of ambition, a Prince of sinne, a slaue of mortalitie. Flesh is flesh; and Blud a Wanton, a chaunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, a compound of contrary elementes, a reuoulting and retrograde Planet, a Sophister, an hypocrite, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postour, an Apostata, an heretique; as conuertible as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, as variable as the weather-cock, as lunatique as the Moone; a generation of corruption, a Whore of Babylon, a limme of the world, and an impe of the Diuell. It is their owne argument in other mens case: and why should it not be other mens argument in their case, Vnlesse they can shew a personall Priuiledge <hi>ad imprimendum solum?</hi> They may speake, as they list: termes of sanctification, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are free for them, that will vse them: but the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion is, euen of the forwardest skirmishers at this day, they doe like other men; and liue like the children of the world, and the brethren of themselues. Some of them
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:4081:66"/>
haue their neighbours good leaue, to be their owne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, or Aduocats, if they please. Yet how probable is it, they are now at their very best, and euen in the neatest and purest plight of their incorruption, whiles their mindes are abstracted from worldly thoughts, to a high meditation of their supposed-heauenly Reformation: and whiles it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily behooueth them, to stand charily and nicely vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the credit of their integritie, sinceritie, precisenesse, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, Zeale, and other vertues? When such respects are ouer, and their purpose compassed according to their harts desier; who can tell how they, or their successours may vse the Keyes; or how they will besturr them with the Sword: If Flesh prooue not a Pope Ioane; and Bloud a Pope Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debrand, good enough. Accidents, that haue happened, may happen agayne: and all thinges vnder the Sunne, are subiect to casualtie, mutabilitie, and corruption. At all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures, it is a braue Position, to maintaine a souerain, and supreme autoritie in euery Consistorie; and to exempt the Minister from superiour Censure; like the high Priest, or greatest Pontiffe, whom Dionysius Haly carnasseus calleth <gap reason="foreign">

He had neede be a wise, and Conscionable man, that should be a Parlame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or a Chauncerie vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: and what a furniture of diuine perfections were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite in the Church, where so many Ministers, so many spirituall high Iustices of Oier, and Terminer: and euery one a supreme Tribunall, a Synode, a Generall Councell, a Canon Law, a heauenly Law, and Gospel vnto himselfe? If no Serpent can come within his Paradise, safe enough. Or were it possible, that the Pastor, (although a man, yet a diuine man) should as it were by inheritance, or succession, continue a Sainct from generation to generation: is it also necessary, that the whole company of the redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Euery subiect is not borne to be a Magistrate, or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer: and who knoweth not, whose creature Superiour Power is? They are very-wise, that are wiser then he, by whose diuine permission, euery one is that he is. The <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conicall Ephory</hi> hath lately borne a great swing, in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Discourses of Princes, and Magistrates; that thought they saued the world from the abhomination of desolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when they found-out a bridle, or yoke for Princes: but old Aristotle was a deepe Politician <hi>in diebus illis:</hi> and his Reasons against that Ephorie (for Aristotle confuted the Ephorie with sounder arguments, then euer it was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to this day) would not yet perhaps be altogither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned: That so great iudiciall causes were committed to men, indued with so little, or no Vertue: That the poore Plebeians for very penurie were easely bribed, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: That there ensued an alteration of the state, the good Kinges being fayne to currie fauour with their great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and to become Popular. Whither this would be the end, and may be the marke of those, or our Populars, I offer it to their consideration, that are most interessed in such motions of Ephoryes and Senioryes. The world is beholding to braue and heroicall myndes, that like Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, would practise meanes to pull-downe Tyrannie, smal, or great: and reforme whole Empires, and Churches, like the three victorious Emperours, surnamed <hi>Magni,</hi> Constantine, Theodosius, and Charles. Thankes, were an vnsufficient recompense for so noble intentions. It

must be a guerdon of value, that should counteruaile their desert, that pretend so fatherly, and Patronly a care of ree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying Commonwealthes, and Churches. Some volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie Counsellours doe well in a State: and men of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary vocation, singularly qualified for the purpose, are worth their double weight in gold. When other sleepe, they watch when other play, they worke: when other feast, they fast: when other laugh, they sigh: whiles other are content to be lulled in securitie, and nusled in abuse, they occupie themselues in deuising pregnant bondes of assurance, and exquisite models of Reformation. Which must presently be aduaunced without further consultatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: or they haue courage, and will vse it in maintenaunce of so diuine abstractes. Melancholie is peremptory in resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and Choler an aeger Executioner. Were it not for those two inuincible arguments, there might still be order taken with other reasons, and autorities whatsoeuer. They do well to presupppose the best of their owne deseignes, and to giue-out Cardes of Fortunate Ilandes, artificially drawen: but as I neuer read, or heard of any people, that committed swordes into such hands, but bought their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience with losse, and had a hard penyworth of their soft cushion: so in my simple consideration, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, how Ignoraunce should become a meeter Officer, then Knowledge; Affection a more incorrupt Magistrate, then Reason; headlong Rashnesse, or wilfull Stubbernesse, a more vpright Iudge, then mature Deliberation; base Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations enact, and establish better orders, then liberall Sciences, or honorable Professions; (any traffique, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer current, or aduantageous, hath bene iudged vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent for a Senatour); tagg, &amp; ragg administer all things ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely-well, with due prouision against whatsoeuer possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

inconueniences, where so many faults are found with persons of better qualitie; that incomparablie haue more skil in the administration of publique affaires; more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and experience in causes; more respect in procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; more regard of their credit; more sense of daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enormities, or contagious abuses; more care of the floorishing and durable estate of the Prince, the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and the Church. Na, I can see no reason, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the best groundes of Pollicie, that euer I read, but for euery Ciuill tyranny, or Pettie misdemeanour, that can possiblie happen now, the gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t standing as it doth; there must needes Vpstart a hundred, and a hundred bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous tyrannies, and huge outrages, were the new plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes, Actes of Parlament; and the Complotters, such high Commissioners, as are described in their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, the floorishes of Vnexperienced wittes. When they haue nothing else to alledge, that should make them supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, or equall to the present Officers; Conscience must be their Text, their Glosse, their Sanctuarie, their Tenure, and their strong hold. Indeede Conscience, grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Science, is a double Ancher; that neither deceiueth, nor is deceiued: and no better rule, then a regular, or publique Conscience; in diuinitie ruled by Diuinitie, in law, by Law, in art by Art, in reason by Reason, in experience by Experience. Other irregular, or priuate Conscience, in Publique functions, will fall-out to be but a lawlesse Church; a ship-mans hose; a iugglers sticke; a phantasticall freehold, and a conceited Tenure <hi>in Capite:</hi> as interchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable as the Moone, and as fallible as the winde. How barratous, and mutinous at euery puffe of Suggestion, lett the world iudge. I would there lacked a present Example, as hoat, as fresh: but hoat looue, soone cold, and the fittes

There goeth a prettie Fable of the Moone, that on a time she earnestly besought her moother, to prouide her a comely garment, fitt and handsome for her boddy: How can that be, sweet daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (quoth the moother) sith your body neuer keepeth at one certaine state, but changeth euery day in the moneth? That priuate Conscience, the sweet daughter of Phansie, be the Morall: and the assurance of the Common People, where there wanteth a curbe, the application. What Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meleon so chaungeth his colour, as Affection? or what Polypus so variable, as <hi>Populus, chorus, fluuius?</hi> Doctour Kelke, when he was Vicechauncelour in Cambridge, would often tell the Aduocats, and Proctors in the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie there, that he had a knacke of Conscience, for their knacke of Law. Truly the man, as he was knowen to be learned, and religious, so seeemed to carrie a right-honest, and harmelesse minde, and would many times be pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disposed after his blunt manner: but in very deede his Conscience (be it spoken without appeachme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his good memorie) other-whiles prooued a knacke, and admitted more inconueniences, (some would haue sayd, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more absurdities) then became the grauitie, and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that iudicious Consistorie.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount in imagination as high, as the hawtiest conceit can aspire; and platforme the most-exquisite deseignes of pure Perfection, that the nicest curiositie can deuise: were not the wisest on your side, most-simplie simple in weying the Consequents of such antecedents, they would neuer so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideratly labour their owne shame, the miserie of their brethren, the desolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Ministery, &amp; the destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church. Good Martin be good to the Church, to the Ministery, to the state, to thy country, to thy patrons, to thy frends, to thy brethren, to thiselfe: and as thou loouest thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, take heede of old Puritanisme, new Anabaptisme, &amp; finall Barbarisme. Thou art young in yeares, I suppose: but younger in enterprise, I am assured. Thy age in some sort pleadeth thy pardon: and couldest thou with any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable temperance aduise thiselfe in time, as it is high time to assuage thy stomachous and ouerlashing outrage; there be fewe wise men of qualitie, but would pittie thy rash proceeding, and impute thy wanton seurrilous Veine to want of Experience, and Iudgement, which is seldome ripe in the Spring. I will not stand to examine the Spirite, that speaketh, or endighteth in such a phrase: but if that were the tenour of a godly, or zealous stile, methinkes some other Sainct, or godly man, should someway haue vsed the like elocution before: vnlesse you meant to be as singular in your forme of writing, as in your manner of censuring; &amp; to publish as graue an Innouation in wordes,

The effect of such diuine motions was heauenly: and whiles that celestiall course continued, with an inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable consent of Vnited mindes, euen in some dissension of opinions, (for there was euer some difference in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) the Gospell reigned, and the Church floorished mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously. It would make the hart of Pietie, to weepe for ioyfull compassion, to remember how the Bloud of those, and those most-patient, but more glorious Martyrs, that might be slaine, but not vanquished, was the Seede of the Church.

Nash, the Ape of Greene, Greene the Ape of Euphues, Euphues the Ape of Enuie, the three famous mammets of the presse, and my three no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious feudists, drawe all in a yoke: but some Schollars excell their masters; and some lustie bloud will do more at a deadly pull, then two, or three of his yokefellowes. It must go hard, but he wil emprooue himselfe, the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table darling of immortall Vanitie. Howbeit his frendes could haue wished, he had not showen himselfe to the world, such a ridiculous <hi>Suffenus,</hi> or <hi>Shakerly</hi> to himselfe, by aduauncing the triumphall garland vpon his owne head, before the least skermish for the victorie: which if he euer obtaine by any valiancie, or bravure, (as he wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth himselfe, the valiantest and brauest Actour, that euer managed penne) I am his bondman in fetters, and refuse not the humblest vassalage to the sole of his boote. Much may be done by close confederacie, in all sortes of coose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and legierdemane: <hi>Monsieur Pontalais</hi> in French, or <hi>Messer Vnico</hi> in Italian, neuer deuised such a nipping Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, as might be made in English, of some leagers in the queint practiques of the Crosbiting Art: but I haue seene many Bearwardes, and Butchers in my time; and haue heard of the one, what belongeth to Apes; and haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the other, not to be affrayde of a doosen horned beastes: albeit some one of them should seeme as dreadfull, as the furious dun Cowe of Dunsmore heath, the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest foman of Sir Guy. Aesops Oxe, though he be a suer ploughman, is but a slowe workeman: and Greenes Ape, though he be a nimble Iuggler, is no suer executioner. Yet well-worth the Master-Ape, and Captaine-mammet, that had a hatcher, aswell as Papp; a Country cuffe, aswell as a figge; a crabtree cudgell, aswell as a nutt; something of a

mans-face, with more of an Apes-face. Had his pen bene muzled at the first, as his mouth hath bene bunged since, these fresh Euphuistes would neuer haue aduentured vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whip, or the bobb: but Silence is a slaue in a chaine; and Patience the common Pack-horse of the world. Euen this brat of an Apesclogge, that can but mowgh with his mouth, gnash with his teeth, quauer with his ten bones, and brandish his goose-quill; presuming of my former suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance, layeth about him with the said quill, as if it were possessed with the sprite of <hi>Orlando Furioso,</hi> or would teach the clubb of Gargantua to speake English. For the flaile of <hi>Aiax</hi> distrawght, or the clubb of Hercules enraged, were but hedge-stakes of the old world; and vnworth the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in an age of puissance emprooued horriblie. The newest Legendes of most hideous exploits, may learne a new Art to kill cow men with peremptorie termes, and bugges-wordes of certaine death. Pore I must needes be plagued; plagued? na, brayed &amp; squised to nothing, that am matched with such a Garga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tuist, as can deuoure me quicke in a sallat; and thundreth more direfull threatnings against me, that onely touched him; then huge Polyphemus rored against Vlysses, that blinded him; or banning Virgill reared against Arius, that spoiled him. <hi>Genus irritabile Vatum.</hi> The generation of rauing Poets, is a swarme of gad-bees; and the anger of a moodie rimester, the furie of a Waspe. A mad Tiger, not like a mad Waspe; and a chafed Wildbore, not comparable to a chafed gad-bee. Take heede of the man, whom Nature hath marked with a gag-tooth; Art furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with a gag-tongue; and Exercise armed with a gag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penne; as cruell and murdrous weapons, as euer drewe bloud.

When the iron Cart is made, and the fierie horses foled, they shall bring the mightie Battring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram of termes, and the great Ordinance of miracles, to towne: aske not then, how he will plague me.

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede a good Souldiour will make a shrewd shift with any weapons: but it is a maruelous hart, that threatneth Ruine, ruine, ruine, with the dint of a bodkin, and the blade of an awle. Where such an other Rodomont, so furious, so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous, so redoutable? There is a peece of a good old Song, peraduenture as auncient, as the noble Legende of Syr Beuis, or Sir Launcelot du Lake:

                  <hi>And he will not dye, kill him with a flye.</hi> He that made that Ryme in iest, little considered, what a gad-fly may doe in earnest. It is small wisedome, to contemne the smallest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: the gad-fly is a little creature; but some little creatures be stingers: neuer fauchon better managed, then some ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy penneknifes: and what will he do, when he rusheth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me with the tempestuous Engins of his owne wit, that keepeth such a horrible coile with his Schoole-fellowes poinado? An Ape is neuer to seeke of a good face, to set vpon the matter. Blessed Euphues, thou onely happy, that hast a traine of such good countenances, in thy floorishing greene-motley liuery: miserable I, the vnhappiest on earth, that am left desolate.

That, and the Vnmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifullest persecution that may be inuented, is cruelly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed against quiet him, that was once thronged and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred with followers: but when he began to giue-ouer that greene haunt, and betooke himselfe to a riper Profession, Diomedes companions were changed into birdes. Times alter: and as Fortune hath more sectaries, then Vertue; so Pleasure hath more adherents, then Proffit: I had no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner shaken of my you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g troupe, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I could not associate as before, but they were festiually reinterteined by some nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wightes, that could take the aduantage of opportunitie (with good visages you may be suer), and had purposely lyne in waite to climbe in Print, by the fall of their Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours: like ambitious Planets, that enhaunse their owne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnities, by the combustion, or retrogradation of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Planettes.

I haue already felt his pulse; and cannot well cast his water, without an Vrinall, either old, or new: but an old Vrinall will not so handsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly serue the turne: it would be as new, as the Capcase of Straunge Newes: but <hi>a pure mirrour</hi> of an impure stale; <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grose,</hi> the clearer to represent a grose substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce; <hi>nor green,</hi> the liuelyer to expresse some greene colours, &amp; other wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton accidents; <hi>nor anyway a harlot,</hi> the trulyer to discoouer the state of a harlatrie.

It is a blabb: but not euery mans blabb, that casteth a sheepes-eye out of a Calues-head; but a blabb with iudgement; but a blabb, that can make excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments blush, and teach Chawcer to retell a Canterbury Tale. But such great Iudicials requier some little studdie: and S. Fame is disposed to make it Hallyday.

I was neuer so sicke of the milt, but I could laugh at him, that would seeme a merry man, &amp; cannot for his life keepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the breath of a fumish foole. Phy, long Megg of West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster would haue bene ashamed to disgrace her Sonday bonet with her Satterday witt.

I was not wont to endight in this stile: but for terming his fellow Greene, as he was notoriously knowen, the Scriuener of Crosbiters; the founder of vgly othes, the greene master of the blacke art; the mocker of the simple world, <hi>et caetera:</hi> see, how the daggletaild rampalion bustleth for the frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenement of the dunghill.

Onely I barre thossame hoursonne vnlawfull termes, steeped in cisternes of Aqua fortis, and Gunpowder: and haue at you a gentle crash; when it shall please the Vrinall, and the Dairy, to giue me leaue to play, with a butter-fly. I doe you, the vttermost credit in the world, that am euer glad to seeke dilatorie excuses, and to craue a terme <hi>ad deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berandum.</hi> The fortune of the field, with pike, or penne, is like the lucke of Nauigation, or the hap of marriage: and I looue not greatly, to chopp vpon maine-chaunces. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Venture, nothing loose; none of the worst rules, or cautels for their securitie, that can tell Storyes of hap-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard; and haue knowen some gallants more hardie, then wise. Humanitie is desirous of Peace with the best; and of truce with the worst: and truly I neuer longed to fight it out with flat strokes, Vntill I must needesly needes: but if there be no remedy by treatie, or amicable composition, although I was euer a sloweworme in the Morning, yet I cannot abide to go to bedd with a Dromedarie. I cannot maruell enough, how the nimble Bee should be ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the sluggish Oxe, or the liuely waspe of the dead horse: but Nature is a miraculous, and omnipotent worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and I finde it true by Experience, that I must learne to imitate by Example, or preiudice miselfe by fauouring other. To preiudice, were a small matter, where the partie leuelleth at no great matter: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a mans credit is assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with bugges-wordes, and his witt beleaguered with the euer-playing shott of the Presse; Wisedome must par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, whom Follie assaileth; and Humanitie dispense with a necessary Apologie. I would I might make it a Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, to make myaduersarie much, and much, and much

better, then he is: that I might reencounter him with the more reputation, or the lesse disparagement: but it is his glory, to shame himselfe notoriously; and he will needes proclaime his owne vanities in a thousand sentences, and whole Volumes of ribaldry; not to be read but vpon a muck-hill, or in the priuyest priuie of the Bordello. Let his Vices sleepe on a downe pillow: would, I could awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his Vertues; and stopp their mouthes, that wish me in sober earnest, not to foile my hands vpon such a contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible rascall; but to let the reckles Villain play with his own shaddow: (Truth is my witnesse, diuers honest men of good reckoning, and sundry worshipfull Gentlemen, haue aduised me in those very termes expresly): but sithence I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe him no good by perswasion, it were follie to suffer him to do me harme by detraction. You that are not ascertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the lewd, and vile disposition of the man, imagin as fauorably of him, as Charitie can possibly conceiue of an impudent Railer, and a prophane mouth: but you, that can skill of learning, and looue Schollership, giue him his desert: do Equitie right, and him no wrong, that wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth whom he listeth. They that haue leysure, to cast-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, (who hath not some idle howers to loose?) may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use his guegawes with indifferency: and finde no Art, but Euphuisme; no witt, but Tarletonisme; no honesty, but pure Scogginisme; no Religion, but precise Marlowisme; no consideration, but meere Nashery: in briefe, no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but light feathers; no accidents, but lighter colours; no transcendents, but lightest phantasies; that sty abooue the highest region of the cloudes, and purpose to haue a saying to the man in the Moone. His mountaines of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, are too-apparent: his designements of Vanitie, too-visible: his plots of Ribaldry, too-palpable: his formes
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:4081:85"/>
of libelling, too-outragious: S. Fame, the goddesse of his deuotion: S. Blase, the idoll of his Zeale: S. Awdry, the lady of his loue: and the young Vicar of old S. Fooles, his ghostly Father. I haue heard of many notable prowde fooles: read of many egregious aspiring fooles: seene many hautie vayneglorious fooles: woondred at ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny busie tumultuous fooles: but neuer sawe such a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous arrogant conceited foole, the very transcendent foole of the Ship; that hugely contemneth all the world, but his owne Flimflams; and against all Pollicie, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his aduersary more then an Asse, and lesse then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; whose victory otherwise mought peraduenture haue seemed something. But to ouercrow an Asse, is a sory Conquest; and a miserable Trophy for so douty a Squier. There were wayes enough of aunswearing, or confuting, with varietie, and reason; to his owne credite, the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of other, and my contentment: although hee had not desperately, and scurrilously broken-out into the fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest and filthiest scurfe of odious termes, that Villany could inuent, or Impudency vtter. Iwis hee mought haue spied a difference, betweene staring, and starke-blinde; betwene raging, and starke-madd; betweene confuting, and rancke rayling in the grossest sort. Had hee seasoned his stile with the least spice of discretion, or tempered his vnmeasurable licentiousnesse with any moderation in the world; or hadd hee not most arrantly laboured, to shew himselfe the very brasen forhead of Impudency, and the iron mouth of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction, without all respect: he mought easily haue found me the calmest, and tractablest aduersary, that euer he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked; as reasonable for him, as for miselfe, in causes of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; and as partiall to foe, as to freend, in controuersies of Trueth. But it is the topp-gallant of his brauest bravure, to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:4081:85"/>
be a Creator of Asses, a Confuter of Asses, and a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Asses: Asses are borne to beare; and Birdes to soare aloft. No winges, to the winges of Self-conceit; nor any sailes, to the sailes of wordes: but hagard winges are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times clipped; and hoised sayles oftentymes humbled. Wordes amou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, like Castels of vapours, or pillars of smoke, that make a mighty showe in the Aier, and straight Vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away. Howbeit Enuie, is a soking Register: and Spite, a Remembrancer of trust. That would be written in a glasse of wine, is otherwhiles founde in tables of marble, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentures of wainescot. The Oestridge can deuoure the rust of Iron; and the gall of present Obloquy may be bruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: but the note-booke of malice, is a monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Tuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone; and the memoriall of Feude, the clawe of an Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant. Pride swelleth in the penne of arrogancy: Vanitie bubleth in the mouth of folly: Rancour boileth in the hart of Vengeance: mischief hammereth in the head of Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: and no such Art memoratiue, as a Crabtree deske. But in contempt of Pride, I will speake one prowde word: Vaine Nash, whom all posterity shall call vaine Nash, were thou the wisest man in England, thou wouldest not; or were thou the valiantest man in England, thou durst not haue written, as thou hast desperatly written, according to thy greene witt: but thou art the boldest bayard in Print; a hare-braind foole in thy head; avile swad in thy hart; a fowle lyer in thy throate; and a vaine-glorious Asse in thy pen: as I will prooue vpon the carkasse of thy wit, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, through-out all the Predicaments of proofe. I hate malice in miselfe: but looue not to be an Vpholster of stuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed, and bombasted malice in other. And bicause thou termest me an old Fencer; (indeede I was once Tom Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys Schollar); and needest displing, asmuch as any rake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hell
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:4081:86"/>
in England: Wheresoeuer I meete thee next, after my first knowledge of thy person, (not for mine owne reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, but for thy correction) I will make thee a simple foole, and a double swad, aswell with my hand, as with my tongue; &amp; will engraue such an Epitaph, with such a Kyrieeleson vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy scull, as shall make thee remembred, when Syr Gawins scull shall be forgotten. Some bibber of Helicon, will deeme it worth eternall record. And if thou entreate me not the fayrer, (hope of amendment preuenteth many ruines), trust me, I will batter thy carrion to dirt, whence thou camst; &amp; squise thy braine to sniuell, whereof it was curdled: na, before I leaue poudring thee, I will make thee sweare, thy father was a Ropemaker; and proclaime thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, the basest drudge of the Presse; with such a straunge Confutation of thine owne straunge Newes, as shall bring Sir Vainglory on his knees; and make Master Impudency blush, like a Virgin. Thy witt already maketh buttons: but I must haue S. Fame disclaime her blacke <hi>Sanctus;</hi> and Nashes deuout Supplication to God, to forgiue Pierces reprobrate Supplication to the Diuell. It must be roundly done: or I will with a charme for a full stomacke, make the gorge of thy belching Rhetorique, &amp; the pau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch of thy sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetting Poetry, fling figures vpward, and downeward. Phy, what neede that be spoken? True: there is choice enough of sweeter flowers; &amp; neat Oratory interteineth neatest Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilitie; (what relish so pleasant, as the breath of Suada; or what smell so aromaticall, as the voyce of the Muses?) but the mouth of a rude Asse, can tast no other lettice; and the spawne of a beastly dogfish, will vnderstand no other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage but his owne. Fury must be tamed with Fury, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Homer, that teacheth the God of the field to strike home; obstinacy awed with obstinacy; force mastred
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:4081:86"/>
with force; threatnings cooled with threatnings; contempt aunswered in his owne toungue: and seeing the wild Colt is so vnreasonably lusty, I meane percase either to make his courage crowch forward, or his Art winch backward. I haue twentie and twentie charmes, for the breaking of stubborne iades, for the biting of mad dogges, for the stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Scorpio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, for the darting of Vrchins, for the haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of sprites, for the storming of tempestes, for the bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of lightning, for the ratling of thunder, and so forth; euen for the craking of an hundred Paphatchets, or a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Greenes, or ten thousand Nashes Peagooses. And in case all happen to faile, (for it must be a mighty Exorcisme, that can coniure-downe Spite) I haue a <hi>Probatumest,</hi> of a rare and powerable vertue, that will hold the nose of his, or his conceit to the grindstone; and make gentle Villanie confesse, all the shreddes, and ragges of his slashingest termes, are worne to the stumpes. The desperate foole may clawbacke himselfe awhile: but it is possible, he may soone finde by sounde Experience; He brayeth open warre against him, that can bray the Asse-drumme in a morter; &amp; stampe his Iewes-trumpe to Pindust. Tom Drumme, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile thiselfe with a Counter-supplication: or suerly, it is fatally done; and thy S. Fame vtterly vndone world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end. As sauory a Sainct, by the verdict of that excellent Gentlewoman, as the cleanely disbursing of the dirtpurse of Sir Gargantua, that made king Charlemaine, and his worthy Chiualry, laugh so mightily, that their heads aked eight dayes after.

Neuer sory lasse so pittifully aweary of her ragged petticote, and dagled taile; the tattered liuery of the confuting Gentleman. Let it go; and the wispe go with it. I honour the meekest Humility; but scorne the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folentest Arrogancy vnder my foote; and say to the highest Imagination of Vanity, Thou art a proude Fopp. When thou carriest thy witt loftiest, and prankest-vpp thy selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looue in his gawdiest colours, Thou art but an Asses head, and a Peacockes taile. Looue other; and thou mayst be looued of other for pure Charity: hate other, and thou art one of the most odious paddes in the world: a Turke, for M. Aschams Archers to shoote-at; and a Iewes eye, for Christian needles. Now a little breathing pawse will do no harme.</p>
               <p>Were not Malice as wilfull in maintaining abuse, as rash in offering thesame; &amp; Arrogancy as obstinate in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, as violent in the Premisses: I readily could, &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly would vndertake a more temperate, and pleasing course: but the fairest offer is fowly contemned; the gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest suite vnkindly repulsed; say I, what I can, malice wilbe itselfe; or do I, what I can, Arrogancy wilbe itselfe: and no other impression can sinke into the hart of Spite, or the eare of Pride, but instigations of Spite, or suggestions of pride. Other motiues, are meere simplicities: and euery treaty of pacification, or parly of reconciliation, the shaking of an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen leafe.

is a shame: to take the foile, were a discredit; to giue the foile, is no credit. A hard case, where Patience may be supposed simple, and auengement will be reputed vnwise; where I cannot hold my peace without warre vpon warre, nor speake without blame vpon blame; where I must either be a passiue, or an actiue Asse in Print. I stand not vpon the point of honour, or vpon termes of reputation: but as it is a glory for the inferiour, to offer the combat, like the Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of prowes, or the Duellist of courage; so I would the superiour might refuse that without preiudice, which he cannot vndertake without disparagement, or performe without obloquie.

An Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Minde, and Fortune, were respectiuely as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoouefull and necessary, as an Anatome of the Body: but this Captain-Confuter, (like galla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Lobbellinus in a new li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery) neither knoweth himselfe, nor other: yet presumeth he knoweth all things, with an ouerplus of somwhat more, in knowing his Railing Grammar, his Rauing Poetry, his Roisting Rhetorique, and his Chopping Logique: with whose helpe, he hath thwitled the milpost of his huge, and omnipotent conceit, to a pudding-pricke of Straunge Newes.

What carrion Asse was the Sire of this vnappeasable Scarabe; or what Scarabe shalbe the sonne and heire of this carrion Asse; I leaue it wholy to the discourse of the learned Aegles, that were euer molested with the buzzing flye, and shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be haunted with the braying Beast.

And bicause the wild-asse wanteth a picker-deuant, let him drinke his owne Vrine, tempered with Spicknard, as he carouseth Helicon; and according to the tradition of Vitalis de Furno, it will procure, and encrease haire; as

Some, tht called him the lukewarme Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour, and likened him to milke from the Cowe, founde him at such a fitt ouerwarme for their feruentest zeale: and I remember a time, when One of the hottest furnace, shewing himselfe little better then a Cowe; He a in quaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring voyce, and a lightning spirite, taught the wild roe his lesson. Hast was not so forward to runne to a commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but Speede was swifter to fly to an aduantage: and where Hast somwhat grosely bewrayed his forwardnesse, Speede very finely marched in a cloude, and founde the goddesse Hypocrisie as sly a Conductrisse, as euer was fayre Venus to Aeneas, or wise Minerua to Vlysses, in their queint passages. We may discourse of naturall Magique, and supernaturall Cabale, whereof the learnedest and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diblest antiquity hath recorded wonderfull Histories: but it is the rod of Mercury, and the ring of Gyges, that worke miracles: and no Mathematician, Magitian, or Cabalist may counteruaile him, that in his heroicall expeditions can walke in a cloude, like a Vapour, or in his diuine pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises go inuisible, like a Spirite.

She hath in my knowledge read the notablest Historyes of the most-singular woomen of all ages, in the Bible, in Homer, in Virgill, (her three so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerain Bookes, the diuine Archetypes of Hebrue, Greeke, and Roman Valour); in Plutarch, in Polyen, in Petrarch, in Agrippa, in Tyraquell, in whom not, that haue special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tendered their diligent deuoir, to honour the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test woomen, that haue liued in the world: and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the meanest, extolling the worthiest, imitating the rarest, and approouing all according to the proportion of their endowments, enuieth none, but Art in person, and Vertue incorporate, the two preciousest creatures, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer floorished vpon earth.

Yet she is a woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and for some passions may challenge the generall Priuiledge of her sexe, and a speciall dispensation in the cause of an affectionate frend, deuoted to the seruice of her excellent desert; whom he hath founde no lesse, then the Handmayd of Art, the mistres of Witt, the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of right Gentlenesse, and the Lady of right Vertue. Howbeit euen those passions she hath so ordered, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, with such a witty temper of violent, but aduised motions, full of spirite, and bloud, but as full of sense, and iudgement, that they may rather seeme the marrow of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, than the froath of affection: and her hoattest fury may fitly be resembled to the passing of a braue career by a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gasus, ruled with the reanes of a Mineruas bridle.

            <p>KNow also, Gentle Reader, that it was the Writers meaning to deuide this Treatise into three bookes: the Second beginning at the <hi>Aduertisement to Pap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatchet, and Martin Mar-prelate:</hi> the Third at, <hi>So then of Pappadocio:</hi> but in the Originall, or vncorrected coppy there was not any such diuision expresly sett-downe: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were the Additions following, inserted in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per places, but annexed to the end of the Third booke, &amp; noted thus.</p>

What speake I of one, or two Inglish Paragons? or what should I blason the gallant, and braue meeters of Ariosto, and Tasso, alwayes notable, sometimes admirable?

Plato comparing Aristotle, and Xenocrates togither; Xenocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, quoth he, needeth a spurre: Aristotle a Bridle. And if Princes, or Parlaments want a goade, may not Subiects, or Admonitions want a snaffle? Is there pretence, for Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to aduise the wisest, or for Zeale to pricke-forward the highest: and no reason for Prudence to curbe Rashnesse, or for Autoritie to reane Licentiousnesse? May Iudgement be whoodwinked with friuolous traditions: and cannot Phantasie be enueigled with newfangled conceites? Superstition and Credulitie—</p>
