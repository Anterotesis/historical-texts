            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall not look back ſo far as to the Originall of the Government of <hi>Kings,</hi> whether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Conqueſt or ſince, nor diſpute the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity or conveniency of the principles, upon which they were eſtabliſhed; although much hath and may be ſpoken for and againſt that form, both from principles of Divinity and Reaſon; on the one hand the Divine inſtitution being pleaded, and not to be denyed; although on the other ſide, as to the manner of conveyance of, and inveſtiture in the exerciſe of the office of Kingſhip, it is alleadged, that there can be no power veſted in one man over many, but it muſt be either <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi> or <hi>mediate:</hi> An <hi>immediate</hi> power given by <hi>God</hi> (ſay they) none can claime; if they can, let it appeare and we will obey gladly; but if not, then their power muſt be <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate:</hi> and if ſo, then it muſt have its birth either from <hi>force,</hi> becauſe <hi>stronger,</hi> or <hi>conſent</hi> and <hi>election:</hi> if by <hi>force,</hi> how long ſoever continued, <hi>freedome</hi> may be regained by the people under that force, when ever opportunity ſerves: if by <hi>conſent,</hi> then there is a mutuall obligation, the one to governe by a Law, the other to obey by a Law, and this (ſay they) <hi>is the moſt ſure baſis of Government, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be exerciſed by one or many.</hi> The reaſon they give for this opinion ought alſo to be conſidered to prevent popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114988:5"/>
confuſions. They ſay where the Government of one or many is eſtabliſhed by <hi>compact,</hi> there the people do not convey a power to any to be exerciſed over them, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the luſt or will of the Magiſtrate,</hi> neither do they bind themſelves unto any <hi>ſervile</hi> or <hi>ſlaviſh obedience,</hi> unto his or their commands, and therefore they eſtabliſh on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half Truſtees, not onely to make and form the Law and compact, by which they will be governed, but alſo to ſee that the ſame be duely performed on the part of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, without which, ſay they, it were a <hi>mockery,</hi> and not a <hi>Government,</hi> each party obliged having upon principles of reaſon the ſame latitude of liberty to break the bond, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>command</hi> or <hi>ſubjection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But my deſigne driving me another way, I ſhall onely take a ſhort view of the State of the affaires and Councils of this Nation, under the Government of the late King in the yeares 1636. 39, 40. And ſo proceed till after many revolutions, we come to find <hi>England</hi> as it were clothed with feares and buryed in trouble and confuſion as at this day, from the conſideration of the cauſes whereof, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall conſequences will by all unbiaſſed perſons be readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deduced and applyed.</p>
            <p>It may be remembred into what parties the <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> and <hi>civil Councels,</hi> under that <hi>unfortunate Prince</hi> were divided, viz. <hi>Arminian</hi> and <hi>Puritane,</hi> among the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Clergy, French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> among the temporall Lords, each party ſeeming to be moſt active in advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kings intereſt, while under-hand they not onely introduced, but alſo nouriſhed and made their own deſignes to flouriſh.</p>
            <p>I need not mention the conſequences of the Councels of thoſe times, becauſe <hi>the long intermiſsion of Parliaments,</hi> the exceſſe of <hi>monopolies,</hi> even to pins and all things of neceſſary uſe, the many illegall and unwarrantable Taxes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114988:5"/>
of money upon the Subject, as in the Caſe of <hi>ſhip-money,</hi> which though but ſmall in it ſelf, yet in reſpect of the principle upon which it was demanded, (viz. <hi>a pretended neceſsity of which the King was ſole judge</hi>) by which the very propriety of every mans Eſtate was and would have been deſtroyed. It being by the ſame rule as lawfull for the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Magiſtrate to demand twenty ſhillings or twenty pounds, if he ſee cauſe, out of every mans Eſtate, as one penny or any other ſumme, becauſe by the Grand Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>England,</hi> and ſeverall other Lawes then in force, nothing ought to be leavied upon the ſubject, but by and with the conſent of the people in <hi>Parliament:</hi> I ſay theſe things are ſo freſh in memory, that I ſhall not need to ſtir thoſe embers any further that have kindled ſuch a fatall fire in the bowels of theſe divided and diſtracted Nations.</p>
            <p>Onely give me leave to mention the method that was obſerved by the Catholick Caball, then governing in Councill, to introduce thoſe troubles, that have ſince been the neceſſary conſequences of their then deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>King, an unlimited Prerogative</hi> was made the <hi>ſugred bait</hi> to allure him to a <hi>countenance of,</hi> and <hi>compliance with them;</hi> it being naturall for all men (eſpecially Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) not onely to admire, but to reach at and covet the encreaſe of power and dominion, eſpecially when the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement thereof ſeemes to be <hi>facile,</hi> and the end <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having brought him to their bent in that particular, then they began to ſpring that mine which had for ſeverall yeares lain hid, <hi>viz.</hi> the introduction of Popery, though not in its own name, nor with its own face, for as yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their their Councils nor forces were ripe for ſo great a work, and therefore the two factions <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:114988:6"/>
being joyned to the <hi>Arminian</hi> part of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who at that time greatly over-powered thoſe that were called <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi> ſet on foot the orders for <hi>conformity and uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in publick worſhip,</hi> and impoſed the publick Liturgy or Common Prayer, ſetting the ſame above preaching, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this not out of any zeal to the Glory of God, but in deſign to heat and perplex all ſuch in the two Nations of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> as were conſcientious, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that by that oppoſition which muſt conſequently be made by them, whoſe principles could not ſubmit to thoſe unwartantable innovations, an occaſion might be given them to incite the King to make uſe of his power by force to impoſe, what otherwiſe his Proclamations and commands could not effect. And this from reaſon and experience, I alleadge to be the parent of the Scotch War, begun under the command of that great <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Factor <hi>Arrundell,</hi> Generall, who indeed was the fitteſt to execute what had been ſo long hammering between him, his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cottington,</hi> and other the Cabaliſts of that faction.</p>
            <p>And by the way it is worth remembring, that while the King with all the power of the nation was engaged in the borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by force to ſubject them, to the deſignes both of his own and their enemies; the <hi>Spaniard</hi> arrives in the <hi>Downes</hi> with a powerfull Fleet and Army, the comming whereof was never ſo much as known by <hi>England,</hi> or at leaſt taken notice of untill ſeen, although forraign preparations doe and ought, generally occaſion (nay neceſſitate) domeſtick proviſions for ſecurity: But the <hi>Dutch</hi> diſſipating them, diverted the ſtorme, and left <hi>England</hi> deſtitute of that proof of their deſigne; which if it had taken, we have cauſe to believe that pretended peace patcht up with the <hi>Scots,</hi> had not been ſo ſoon made: but being put upon new Councells, and that forraign aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance failing, they feared to rely upon the ſtrength of

their Army; (which though as to men gallant and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,) yet being ſomewhat divided, and all <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them in feares, the appearance of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid having put men upon conſideration; leſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne ſhould appeare both to the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>people,</hi> I ſay <hi>a peace is patcht up,</hi> the <hi>Army disbanded,</hi> and a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment called,</hi> by the expectation whereof the people began a little to be quieted, in hopes that by thoſe <hi>Phyſitians</hi> the nation might be <hi>cured</hi> of all its <hi>diſtempers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſuch was the <hi>compoſition</hi> thereof, by reaſon of the <hi>prevalency</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> in point of <hi>Elections</hi> of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> and mixture of intereſts of the <hi>Lords Spirituall</hi> and <hi>Temporall,</hi> that as little could be rationally expected from them, as was effected by them at their meeting; for as the intention of calling, was only to juſtifie the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> War by a <hi>Law,</hi> and to get money by a <hi>loane</hi> or <hi>ſubſidie</hi> to carry it on, to which the Commons would by no meanes aſſent, ſo all expectations became fruſtrate by their ſpeedy diſſolution, and the ſetting on foot new Councells and deſignes to increaſe the flame, and encite the King to make new leavies againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> impriſon ſeverall Members of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and Scotch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners ſent and attending to ratify the Treaty, ſeize ſeverall of the Ships and Goods of the Scotch, and by all meanes endeavour to ſuppreſſe and deſtroy the <hi>Puritane</hi> party as they call them, who they judged the onely great enemies to the King; whereas they took the exacteſt courſe in the world to make them ſuch, all their deſignes and actings being clothed by his power, and ſtrengthened by his warrant and Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>And to the end the want of money might not retard or hinder the vigorous proſecution of the War, <hi>the Biſhops open their bags and raine ſhowers of Gold</hi> thereby juſtly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving occaſion for it to be called, <hi>Bellum Epiſcopale;</hi> but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114988:7"/>
notwithſtanding their haſte, the <hi>Scots</hi> who ſuſpected foule play, had formed an Army, and were upon their march into <hi>England,</hi> before they could raiſe and rendezvouz, and maugre their ſpeed, after their routing of a party nigh <hi>Newborn,</hi> engaged by the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> (as is really believed) upon deſigne to make the War certain, the <hi>Scots</hi> enter <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and poſſeſſe <hi>Durham</hi> and parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent, while the King retires to <hi>York,</hi> neither Army pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding any further to acts of hoſtility.</p>
            <p>But by the way it is obſervable, the Earle of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> who a little before could not be ſuffered upon any termes to paſs <hi>Trent,</hi> being popular in the <hi>North,</hi> and a moderate <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> muſt be made Generall, the better to colour the buſineſſe; and ſince the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> aſſiſtance failed, a new forraign force muſt be made uſe of, and the Catholick Iriſh, <hi>His Majeſties then pretended moſt loyall Subjects muſt be armed,</hi> and engaged in this religious War, contrary to reaſon, common rules of prudence or ſafety, and the conſequences whereof did ſoon after viſibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in that horrid rebellion, which ended in the ſorrow and ruine of the deſigners.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> being in <hi>England,</hi> and neceſſities encreaſing, many of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> were ſummoned to attend upon the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>York,</hi> where after mature conſideration of the State of affaires, a <hi>Paliament</hi> is agreed to be <hi>ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned,</hi> and Writs iſſue out accordingly.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Parliament</hi> being met, and an account being taken of the <hi>neceſsities</hi> and <hi>demands</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> after many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, the <hi>Parliament</hi> reſolve and declare, <hi>That unleſſe they might be ſecured to ſit untill the grievances of the people were conſidered and redreſſed, they would grant no ſupplies, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedle with the Scotch War, but leave it as they found it,</hi> or to that purpoſe. This reſolution was a bitter pill to the Court, and hard of digeſtion, but yet <hi>neceſsity has no Law,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:114988:7"/>
down it muſt, and therefore an <hi>antidote</hi> muſt be prepared and lie in readineſs as a cure for this <hi>poyſon:</hi> For the caſe ſtands thus, if the <hi>Parliament</hi> be not <hi>ſatisfyed,</hi> then no <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply;</hi> there is an enemy in the Land, and an Army ful of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents for want of pay, the <hi>biſhops bags</hi> either being <hi>empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> or <hi>ſhut up:</hi> now if the <hi>Parliament</hi> paſs an act for ſo many ſubſidies, upon the confidence of their ſecurity; then though the <hi>King</hi> continue them to ſit by a <hi>Law,</hi> yet may the <hi>Army</hi> or a conſiderable part thereof be by money hired to <hi>break them up,</hi> upon pretence of neceſſity, firſt <hi>created</hi> and then pleaded: upon which reſolution the <hi>King</hi> is wonne to paſſe that act ſo much pleaded, as matter of his <hi>juſtification</hi> and <hi>conceſsions</hi> to the <hi>Parliament.</hi> But whether he did really know, or were privy to the after game that was to be plaid upon them, after they had granted their ſupplies, I ſhall forbear to cenſure; onely leave it to the judgement of the Reader upon the conſideration of ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent tranſactions.</p>
            <p>But this is evident to the knowledge and experience of the Author, that accordingly both by Letters and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions under the <hi>hand</hi> and <hi>Seal</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> many endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were uſed to engage the Army to <hi>breake up the Parliament,</hi> the forementioned Act for their continuance notwithſtanding; and upon diſcovery whereof, the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> were conſtrained (<hi>though by contracting great debts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the publick</hi>) to undertake to <hi>ſatisfy</hi> the <hi>Scots,</hi> and to <hi>pay</hi> and <hi>disband</hi> that <hi>Army</hi> to prevent the deſignes, that were hatched and carryed on under their covert. And this I may call the firſt viſible cauſe of the <hi>Parliaments</hi> jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that the King although he did ſeemingly comply with them, yet under-hand did depend upon, and was guided by other Councells.</p>
            <p>It is not my buſineſſe to give an account of the weekly proceeds of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> onely by generall hints of

            <p>The buſineſs of <hi>Delinquents,</hi> eſpecially the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and diſpoſition of the <hi>Militia,</hi> were the moſt conſiderable viſible cauſes of difference between the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament;</hi> other things might and did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene, as additionall fuell to increaſe that flame, which ſince hath ſcorched (if not burnt) all on both ſides that had a hand in the kindling of it: but probably buſie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in each party, having deſignes retrograde to the grand end, which ſhould have been peace and unity, <hi>viz.</hi> Souldiers of fortune; that deſired to fiſh in troubled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and hoped to riſe by others ruines, animating the Court to extreames; the greateſt whereof was the illegall demand of the five Members; and others as buſie to take that advantage, to abet the people in Petitioning with ſeeming violence for ſuch things as could not but in that juncture of affaires create jealouſies and feares in the <hi>King;</hi> I ſay things being brought thus into a ſuddain hurry, and the people which not many dayes before, upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Scotland,</hi> had entertained him with acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of joy; now declaiming againſt him upon pretence of the denyall of Juſtice: And being ſeduced by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Counſellours, he firſt ſends the Queen for <hi>Holland,</hi> and afterward leaves the <hi>Parliament;</hi> and retires himſelf from place to place, till he arrived at <hi>York;</hi> to whom the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſent an humble Petition praying his return, and ſeverall Members are Commiſſioned to give his Majeſty ſatisfaction touching his demands: But the <hi>deſigne</hi> for <hi>War</hi> was laid, although <hi>peace</hi> was <hi>pretended;</hi> and a ſeeming <hi>neceſsity</hi> for his departure <hi>pleaded,</hi> upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>tumults;</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> was a burthen, and muſt be removed: and it is ſubmitted to judgement whether

            <p>To initiate the War, inſtead of returning to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>although often Petitioned to that purpoſe;</hi> a <hi>guard</hi> muſt be raiſed <hi>for the ſecurity of his Majeſties perſon,</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly is; in the meane time ſeverall Members of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> (whether through <hi>fear</hi> of the <hi>event,</hi> or <hi>hopes</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> of advantage; or by what other allurements I ſhall not determine) <hi>Betrayed</hi> their <hi>trusts,</hi> left the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and went to the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>York;</hi> thereby not onely giving countenance to thoſe proceedings, but alſo much leſſening <hi>the power of Parliament.</hi> In the mean time Commiſſions were iſſued under-hand, for leavies of men, in order to form an <hi>Army</hi> againſt the <hi>Parliament;</hi> and Proviſions in hand for the erection of his <hi>Standard</hi> at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> which was ſoon after put in execution: Theſe preparations put the <hi>Parliament</hi> upon new thoughts, and ſeeing neither <hi>Meſſages</hi> nor <hi>Petitions</hi> could prevaile, and that there was a neceſſity laid upon them, <hi>either to betray the Liberties of the people, that had truſted them,</hi> and the <hi>Lawes</hi> of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> into the power of thoſe <hi>evill Counſellours,</hi> who had as aforeſaid <hi>abuſed</hi> and <hi>betrayed</hi> the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdome</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo many <hi>troubles;</hi> or otherwiſe to caſt themſelves upon

the <hi>affection</hi> of their <hi>Truſtees,</hi> and the <hi>juſtice</hi> of their <hi>cauſe;</hi> and in defence thereof to raiſe an Army, which they accordingly did, and put the ſame under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> with Commiſſion onely to defend their <hi>Authority,</hi> and protect the <hi>people</hi> as much as might be from the <hi>force</hi> of the enemy.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not enumerate the various <hi>ſucceſſes</hi> of the <hi>Armies,</hi> being unwilling to <hi>renew the teares of the Parents, Widowes and Orphans; made Husbandleſſe, Fatherleſſe and Childleſſe in that unhappy War;</hi> onely in reſpect of ſome ſubſequent tranſactions, I muſt give a hint or two of ſome remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſages, upon the baſis whereof a great part of the ſucceeding narrative depends.</p>
            <p>The War being proſecuted with violence in all parts of the Nation, an aſſociation of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and other Counties was made, and a diſtinct Army, raiſed under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter;</hi> others were on foot in other parts, according to their reſpective neceſſities under Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>Mancheſters</hi> Army being moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the moſt part of <hi>ſober ſerious Christians,</hi> though of different judgements; God was pleaſed ſignally to own them in their actings and ſucceſſes, more then any other force imployed at that time on the behalf of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and particularly in that engagement at <hi>Marſton-Moore,</hi> and the ſiege of <hi>York:</hi> The defeat then given being the firſt conſiderable weakning that ever the Kings party received. I confeſs there were joyned in the ſaid engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the <hi>Scots,</hi> who had been called in to the <hi>Parliaments</hi> aſſiſtance: But as to their merit in that engagement, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome few of the Gentry, I think it will become me to be ſilent, the whole brunt of the day lying upon the Forces of <hi>Fairfax</hi> and <hi>Manchester;</hi> and indeed it may well be reputed a ſharp engagement, ſeeing all the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls on both ſides left the Field, not knowing the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114988:9"/>
In which dayes Exerciſe, Col: <hi>Cromwel,</hi> then <hi>Mancheſters</hi> Lieutenant Generall, did eminently merit the praiſe of a prudent and valiant Leader: Not to derogate from thoſe many others, in whoſe places reſpectively, they valiantly and faithfully diſcharged their duties.</p>
            <p>But by the way, give me leave to mention a paſſage that hapned ſoon after that engagement; during the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſiege of <hi>York</hi> as I may call it: The ſucceſs of that battaile and daily expectation of the ſurrender of <hi>York,</hi> then deſpairing of relief; put the Army upon great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of a ſudain alteration of affaires, either by a <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall conqueſt</hi> or <hi>ſpeedy and effectuall treaty;</hi> whereupon the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> and L: G: <hi>Cromwell</hi> diſcourſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the regulating the exorbitancy of the Nobility; L: Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> haſtily replyed, that it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be well with <hi>England,</hi> ſo long as the <hi>Title</hi> of a <hi>Lord</hi> remained; by which it might have been judged, that ſuch a principle of ambition as afterward manifeſted it ſelf, had not lodged in his breſt: But we ſee all is not <hi>Gold</hi> that <hi>gliſters, opportunity</hi> makes <hi>theeves;</hi> and therefore it is not ſafe to truſt the moſt ſpecious pretences, if it may be avoided, for fear of the like danger.</p>
            <p>But as the <hi>Parliament</hi> gained in the <hi>North,</hi> they loſt in the <hi>Weſt;</hi> the different <hi>Commands</hi> creating different <hi>intereſts,</hi> ſo that the work was not like to <hi>proſper,</hi> unleſs there was a new <hi>model;</hi> upon which the Gentleman laſt mentioned being a Member of the houſe, and having gained to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a conſiderable party, upon the repute he had of <hi>hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi> and <hi>gallantry:</hi> He then ſeeming, (and I really believe) at that time was a <hi>great lover</hi> of, and <hi>encourager of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> I ſay having gradually increaſed his intereſt, and yet being unwilling it ſhould appeare too conſiderable; his deſign being not probably ripe for execution, a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying ordinance was introduced, (I will not ſay by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114988:10"/>
whom;) although the conſequences thereof may and do ſpeak handſomely to that purpopſe: For that being paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, both <hi>Eſſex, Mancheſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Waller,</hi> and all the Members of Parliament, whether Lords or Commons, were out of Command, and himſelf too. So that as to the face of things, no man could judge of any deſign in him, more then the publick good: But things remaining in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, a Generall muſt be thought on, and accordingly Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax,</hi> a Gentleman of unqueſtionable inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and full fraught with gallantry; (but a perſon of a paſſive Spirit as to Councells,) was made Generall; and the Forces put under his Conduct: who no ſooner was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a march, and drawing nigh to a poſſibility of engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but he directs a letter to the Parliament, therein deſiring that Lieutenant Generall <hi>Cromwell</hi> might be ſent to his aſſiſtance, upon which the houſe by a reſolve im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power him thereto; for I never yet heard of any other Commiſſion: upon this he repaires to the <hi>Army;</hi> and in the quality of Lieutenant Generall manages the affaires, and ſteeres the Councells thereof, upon whom he had a mighty influence, as having been the inſtrument of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their advancements; ſo that in effect, what ever ſucceſs attended that Army, the Major part of the honour returned to the Lieutenant Generall; beſides the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by increaſe of intereſt and diſpoſing of Commands; he countenancing and diſcountenancing whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, according as they were inſtruments fit to be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his then growing deſignes.</p>
            <p>I ſhall wave the various occurrences of the War, and look forward till we find the War ended; and the King delivered by the <hi>Scots</hi> for a ſumme, (much exceeding the ſalary of <hi>Judas;</hi>) where remaining under an honourable reſtraint at <hi>Holmby,</hi> Commiſſioners were ſent to treat with him, upon an accommodation <hi>fit for the King to grant</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:114988:10"/>
and the <hi>Parliament to require;</hi> but as heretofore, that treaty was rendred alſo ſucceſſeleſs; the reaſon thereof is not very obvious: yet if the probable conjectures of ſome that in other things have not been miſtaken, may be believed, the Kings obſtinacy in that treaty, had its riſe from ſome encouragement given him of the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Army, then ſet on foot by a party that called themſelves <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> at leaſt ſeemed ſuch, on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the relief of <hi>Ireland;</hi> whereas in truth there was nothing leſs in deſign, then to divide the Army, and to draw off pretenſively for <hi>Ireland;</hi> ſuch a party as they knew would joyne with them in their deſign againſt them, they called <hi>Independents,</hi> and to <hi>disband the reſt,</hi> and to bring in the King meerly upon the ſettlement of a <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian intereſt;</hi> which though I cannot but judge ſome of them godly men, yet ſo far as they are rigidly acted, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that principle of <hi>coercive power over mens Conſciences;</hi> I think it would be madneſs to impower them by a Law, <hi>who have a zeal but not according to knowledge;</hi> and are led by a <hi>hot-braine party,</hi> ſome whereof are Miniſters; who could not indure the exerciſe of that power in the <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Clergy</hi> over <hi>themſelves,</hi> but cryed it down as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, &amp; yet are ready to conteſt unto fire and fagot for the exerciſe of it over their brethren, every way as <hi>lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, pious, laborious</hi> and <hi>faithfull</hi> as themſelves; though probably not ſo covetous, as to have two or three Livings and Lectures: But this by the way. The treaty was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and the <hi>Army refuſed to disband</hi> or be divided, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they had their Arreares ſecured, and ſaw the ends pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as the fruit of all that blood, and treaſure that had been exhauſted in the War, in ſome meaſure anſwered to the people, of which they were a part as Engliſhmen, as well as Souldiers: The flame being thus kindled by the <hi>hot-ſpurres of the houſe,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:114988:11"/>
               <hi>Holis, Prinne</hi> and <hi>the reſt;</hi> Major Generall <hi>Skippon</hi> and others more moderate muſt be imployed to quench the fire; and in the meane time a new deſign is ſet on foot to remove the King from <hi>Holmby</hi> to ſome place of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and then in his name to declare againſt the Army and their abettors in the houſe; and by that means to bring all the fury of the wearied people of the Nation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Souldiery,</hi> that had been in the hand of God, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that peace they then injoyed; and had it not been wiſely foreſeen and prevented, the conſequence thereof had been much worſe, to ſeverall thouſands of the godly people of this Nation, then either the <hi>Biſhops perſecution,</hi> or <hi>former War;</hi> I confeſs I muſt call the work good, though not the manner of it, nor event, to remove the King out of the hands of a party, that intended to <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolize</hi> his power, to the <hi>ruine of their brethren;</hi> I think was not only fit, but of abſolute neceſſity: But to deny the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Command, and to call God publickly to witneſs a lye, as did the L. G. in <hi>Parliament,</hi> as I have been informed; I look upon it if true as the firſt rivolet that began to let in a deluge of miſeries upon himſelf and family. But the King was removed, and the camp metamorphoſed into a Court, ſome of the then principall Commanders lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to flatter ſooner then they could to fight.</p>
            <p>How the <hi>King</hi> was courted as to the giving of honours, thereby endeavouring to render the advancement of four or five General Officers, the price of the blood and treaſure ſpent in the War; ſeverall papers printed and publiſhed by ſome that were <hi>nick-named Levellers,</hi> and confirmed with the loſſe of their bloods as ſure teſtimonies, may ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently evidence; and for my part, I do really believe when the King lay at <hi>Cauſham,</hi> and was afterward upon his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and ſolemn engagement, not to do any thing that might tend to the diſturbance of the Peace; (beſides his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114988:11"/>
private promiſes to <hi>Whalley</hi> and others) that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding part of the Army, did really intend his <hi>re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment;</hi> otherwiſe it would not have been preſſed with ſuch <hi>Candor</hi> and <hi>Zeal,</hi> by their addreſſes to the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> neither would they (having Petitioned the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> not to <hi>Command them to bring the King nearer Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>) notwithſtanding bring him to <hi>Hampton Court;</hi> and permit the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners to have free acceſs; whereby the <hi>King</hi> became lyable to the breach of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, <hi>by giving Commiſsion to Hamilton to invade,</hi> and alſo thereby gave birth to all thoſe following inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of <hi>Surrey, Kent, &amp;c.</hi> ſet on foot by the royall <hi>Presbyterian</hi> ſticklers, on purpoſe to give time by buſying the Army, for <hi>Hamilton</hi> to fall into the Aſſociation; which if effected, the conſequences thereof may be eaſily judged.</p>
            <p>I need not mention the diſpute between the parties, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Militia of London,</hi> nor the iſſue thereof; ſince it produced no good on their part that contrived it: But the <hi>flight</hi> of <hi>ſome</hi> and <hi>impriſonment</hi> of <hi>others;</hi> and the poſitive owning of that party of <hi>Parliament</hi> that were oppoſers of that intereſt. Onely it will be worthy conſideration what method was then obſerved by <hi>O. C.</hi> who then managed all the affaires of the Army in effect, and had as hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous a game to play between the Inſurrecters &amp; Levellers as ever came to hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the caſe thus ſtood, the King (by whoſe reſtauration he expected the old honour challenged by the <hi>Cromwells,</hi> as was then ſuggeſted; and upon whoſe account he had exaſperated his trueſt friends) had left him in the midſt of a divided Army, fired with diſcontents, all ready to fall on him; (a conſiderable part of the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> then ſitting, being diſobliged and angry; as having ſome jealouſies that he deſigned his own greatneſs) to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the fury of a potent Nation; backt with the power of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114988:12"/>
a rich and prevalent party in the Kingdom; beſides the <hi>reliques of Royalty,</hi> that the <hi>Sun-beames</hi> of his <hi>complacency</hi> and <hi>countenance,</hi> had alſo <hi>warmed</hi> and <hi>enlivened</hi> to give him new trouble.</p>
            <p>Seeing himſelf thus enſnared, if by the moſt reall diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his ſorrow and ſhame for his aberation and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering he could unite a conſiderable part of the Army to ſtand fixt, and <hi>disband</hi> or <hi>Caſheere</hi> the <hi>wilfull,</hi> yet they muſt divide into the ſeverall parts of the Nation; where the appearance of enemies required their ſervice: Leave the <hi>King</hi> to the charge and care of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> he dare not; and to carry him with him in his Marches both <hi>troubleſome</hi> and <hi>dangerous,</hi> therefore firſt the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of thoſe called <hi>Levellers,</hi> muſt be <hi>heightned,</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to give occaſion of telling an officious, but falſe lie to the <hi>King</hi> to incite fear, viz. <hi>that the Levellers intended his death by ſome ſudden attempt,</hi> by which <hi>bait</hi> and the <hi>treachery</hi> of ſome of his own <hi>confidents,</hi> he was dril'd unto the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Wight;</hi> whither <hi>Colonell Hammond</hi> was ſent to receive him; yet all this while the <hi>Parliament</hi> were kept in <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and muſt be, it being not ripe for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery till the iſſue of <hi>Ware-Rendezvouz</hi> was ſeen, and then juſt in the nick, as if the product of providence, newes of the Kings being taken is promulged with much joy; when he was never looſe, but trapan'd as they call a ſnare faſter then ever.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſecured the <hi>King,</hi> the next work is to quiet the <hi>Rebells,</hi> before the <hi>Scots</hi> could be ready to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade;</hi> but the work proving of greater difficulty and length then was imagined, had not the goodneſs of God, aſſiſting Major Generall <hi>Lambert</hi> in his Conduct, beyond expectation retarded their march: It had been impoſſible for the Forces out of <hi>Wales,</hi> to have joyned, or been in a condition to Fight them; much leſs give them ſuch a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114988:12"/>
totall overthrow, as the ſucceſſe of that day did mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</p>
            <p>After the rout of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and reducing of <hi>Colcheſter;</hi> we are at leiſure to conſult future ſafety, and in order to that, both parties are at work; the Royall pretended <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,</hi> whoſe intereſt depends principally upon the <hi>King:</hi> They preſs on a treaty, and the other (as they had reaſon) find no ground to truſt him, that had broke ſuch a ſolemn engagement, and put the Nation to ſo much hazard: beſides the expence of Blood and Treaſure, which at that juncture of time was a great aggravation; ſo that now the ſcale is turned, and that party that formerly thought nothing the King offered ſatisfactory, are now willing to receive any thing: And the other party that formerly were willing to depend upon the Kings perſonall engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will not now truſt his oath, though ratifyed by a Law, as knowing that Princes acted by policy, judge no obligation of force that thwart's their deſigned power or advantage.</p>
            <p>In the purſuance of theſe ends both parties act, the Royall <hi>Presbyters</hi> are at the old trade of Petitions and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements abroad, thereby to give countenance to their proceedings in <hi>Parliament;</hi> and being prevalent in the houſe, Vote not onely a treaty in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Wight,</hi> but alſo without much adoe, <hi>as if the matter were concluded by inſtruction,</hi> Vote the Kings conceſſions <hi>ſatisfactory;</hi> when if what was offered at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> upon thoſe Propoſitions, and at <hi>Holmby</hi> by the King perſonally were conſidered, it wil appeare that there was more reaſon for the acceptance of peace <hi>then,</hi> then now; the caſe being much altered: but it is evident it was not their <hi>affection,</hi> but the <hi>neceſsity</hi> of their <hi>intereſt,</hi> that drew them to this <hi>change</hi> of <hi>opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other <hi>party</hi> had no reaſon if they could avoid it, to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114988:13"/>
               <hi>ſuffer</hi> theſe <hi>proceeds;</hi> the ratification whereof muſt needs concenter in their ruines. The conſideration whereof made then, not onely to conſider the carriage of affaires by the King, <hi>who had left no meanes unattempted to deſtrey the Parliament, and inſlave the people,</hi> and that in oppoſition to that deſigne, the people (being acted by them as their Truſtees) had <hi>hazarded</hi> their <hi>Lives,</hi> and ſpent their <hi>Bloods</hi> and <hi>Eſtates;</hi> that therefore unleſs they would bring all the Blood that had been ſhed upon their own heads, they ought in <hi>judgement</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> at leaſt <hi>by a publick try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of the King,</hi> to aſſert the <hi>publick justice of the Nation;</hi> in oppoſition to that principle of being <hi>unaccountable</hi> ſave onely to <hi>God:</hi> In purſuance whereof the treaty was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, the King removed; and ſoon after the Heads of the ſaid faction, that had ſo often attempted upon the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as to <hi>breach</hi> of <hi>Priviledge;</hi> endeavour to <hi>divide</hi> the <hi>Army,</hi> under-hand contrivances as to occaſion the late <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections;</hi> of which ſeverall of them might have been convict, if the more weighty affaires of the Nation then on foot, had not conſtrained the <hi>Parliament</hi> to wave their proſecution, and remain ſatisfyed, in that the <hi>Clogs,</hi> that made their <hi>Chariot wheels</hi> go heavy, were removed.</p>
            <p>As to the reſults touching <hi>throwing down Kingſhip,</hi> as <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>chargeable, Peereſhip</hi> as <hi>uſeleſſe,</hi> and for the <hi>tryall</hi> of the <hi>King;</hi> the Records of <hi>Parliament</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, I ſhall omit to treat any further thereon, onely I ſhall adde this and ſubmit it: Whether ſeeing on all hands it is granted that the <hi>King,</hi> before he could do any <hi>regall act,</hi> did ſolemnly ſwear <hi>to rule according to the eſtabliſht Law, and to grant ſuch Lawes as the people ſhould chooſe;</hi> whether I ſay the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that were the moſt proper judges on that behalf, had not power by Law to call him to account for the breach of the ſaid oath; eſpecially ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the breach of the ſaid oath is without all manner of queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:114988:13"/>And whereas it is alleadged by thoſe who cannot deny the former, <hi>that although the King may be accountable to a Parliament, as the proper judges of Law,</hi> and the <hi>breaches of it;</hi> yet it ought to be <hi>legall</hi> and <hi>free.</hi> As touching theſe objections, they ſhall be in due time anſwered, to the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all thoſe that are not wilfully blind: But I muſt proceed with my narrative.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> being <hi>tryed</hi> and <hi>Executed,</hi> whether by directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Parliament,</hi> or to gratify a particular deſign, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not me to diſpute: however the <hi>waters</hi> that had been <hi>troubled, grew ſmooth</hi> and <hi>calm,</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi> began to cure thoſe ſores that our many yeares troubles had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned.</p>
            <p>In particular, many publick debts were ſatisfyed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted upon the publick faith, in the beginning of the War; and increaſed by new ſecurities in the progreſs thereof. In ſhort, affaires were ſo managed by the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conduct of Councells, that not onely <hi>Ireland</hi> (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>O.

to gain, who ever loſe; and to make their deſign faſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they made ſure of the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> who (as was ſaid before) was a Gentleman exceeding paſſive in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, though otherwiſe valiant and active; it becomes not me to diſpute the reaſons of his diſſatisfaction in ſome caſes, what ever is not of faith is ſin, let it now ſuffice, he refuſed to engage againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> and thereby put the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to the neceſſity; and ſending for <hi>O. C.</hi> then Generall in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who had much adoe to order his affaires there, ſo as to come timely to receive the power of Generall, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding many letters ſent him on that behalf: But Providence ordered <hi>that the Parliaments Idol ſhould be their Scourge,</hi> otherwiſe probably as <hi>able,</hi> as <hi>honeſt,</hi> I am ſure as <hi>faithfull</hi> and <hi>leſſe dangerous,</hi> might have had the Conduct of that affaire, and left <hi>him</hi> to the enjoyment of <hi>one,</hi> that by that means would not be contented with <hi>three:</hi> But <hi>he loved to be Courted,</hi> that when time offered he might <hi>twit the Parliament with their neceſsity and his ſervice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Into <hi>Scotland</hi> he marches, and to give him his due, <hi>he under-went many hard-ſhips;</hi> beſides a dangerous fit of <hi>ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> from which if God had been pleaſed in mercy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him by <hi>death,</hi> I believe he had not been guilty of that <hi>perjury, blood</hi> and <hi>apoſtacy</hi> that afterward he contracted.</p>

deſigned to <hi>perpetuate</hi> their <hi>power,</hi> whereas if I be not infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med amiſſe, when <hi>diſſolved,</hi> they were paſſing the <hi>act</hi> for <hi>ſucceſsive Repreſentatives,</hi> and had diſſolved themſelves and given a <hi>period</hi> to that <hi>Law</hi> for their <hi>continuance,</hi> within very few dayes afterwards.</p>
            <p>But ſuch a diſſolution could not ſuit with his Aimes: had they diſſolved <hi>orderly,</hi> the power in the intervall would have been legally in the <hi>Councill of State,</hi> and a <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity</hi> could not have been ſet on foot to call a <hi>Convention</hi> of, (I believe honeſt men;) but of <hi>intereſts</hi> and <hi>opinions</hi> as various <hi>as</hi> the <hi>colours</hi> in <hi>Joſephs Coate,</hi> and as unlikely to cement in order to <hi>ſecurity, ſervice</hi> or <hi>ſettlement,</hi> as <hi>tiſſue</hi> and <hi>broad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cloath,</hi> which conſtantly fret and weare out one another.</p>
            <p>But the ſucceſs of that convention was ſuitable to the deſigne of their calling; for though during their ſitting, they did nothing of any conſiderable moment; yet at their riſe, a party of them gave the power into the hands of the Generall, who under colour thereof took upon himſelf the Title of <hi>Lord Protector,</hi> but exerciſed the power of a <hi>Tyrant:</hi> all his Ordinances impoſed on the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, being the meer products of his <hi>will,</hi> and formed upon the great <hi>plea of neceſsity</hi> by him <hi>created.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Should I ennumerate the manifold advantages that <hi>England</hi> did receive by his Government, <hi>I fear this incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous generation would not believe it,</hi> or at leaſt would be <hi>diſtaſted</hi> thereat; I ſhall therefore onely mention ſome few for publick ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that honorable and advantageous peace made with <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that glorious War made with <hi>Spain, (En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> faſt friend in all the late Troubles,) by which the Trade of <hi>England</hi> is more detrimented, then by all the Wars we have had ſince 1638.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:114988:15"/>Thirdly, that gallant Expedition to <hi>Santa Domingo,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was ſent a conſiderable Army upon two accounts, as is believed, the one to rid himſelf of ſome diſcontented Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, which he feared would obſtruct his ſecond deſign of <hi>Kingſhip;</hi> the other if the deſign took to render himſelf able by the <hi>expected Treaſure,</hi> to maintain a <hi>Mercenary Army,</hi> to <hi>ſubject</hi> the people to his arbitrary Commands, which he judged the more <hi>facile,</hi> in reſpect of the pretended <hi>eaſe</hi> he gave them in <hi>abatement of Taxes;</hi> which he did not ſo much out of <hi>affection</hi> to the <hi>people,</hi> but to contract debts, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the payment thereof upon his pretended <hi>Parliaments,</hi> thereby giving the people not onely an occaſion of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint;</hi> but alſo by degrees <hi>eating out their affections to Parliaments,</hi> and rendring the onely means of their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration to freedome, burthenſome,</hi> if not <hi>irkeſome</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe his great <hi>expectation</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> proved but a <hi>golden dreame,</hi> to ſave his credit the <hi>Spaniſh War</hi> muſt be proſecuted in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and in order thereto a peace is made with the <hi>French,</hi> an Army is formed and tranſported under the Conduct of Sir <hi>John Reynolds,</hi> a new Knight made by the Protector, ſome ſay as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for his Apoſtacy from, and treachery to the Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers at <hi>Burford;</hi> of which if he were guil<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I ſhall not take upon me to give any reaſon, why the ſucceſs of this Army ſhould be different from the former, although if their <hi>principles</hi> be compared, it may give ſome little <hi>light</hi> thereto; let it ſuffice that their uninterrupted

ſucceſs gained him much <hi>credit,</hi> and rendred him very <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable abroad,</hi> though not much <hi>loved</hi> at <hi>home;</hi> his whole life being accompanied with <hi>plots</hi> and <hi>conſpiracies,</hi> ſome whereof were reall, although others tis feared of his own contriving: But to proceed.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, his frequent Impriſonment of the <hi>Gentry</hi> and others, many whereof he had no other cauſe of exception againſt, then that they were <hi>faithfull</hi> to their <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and ſo could not comply with his <hi>ends,</hi> and therefore as to be <hi>feared,</hi> ſo to be <hi>ſecured,</hi> and that not onely for <hi>months</hi> but <hi>yeares,</hi> to the <hi>ruine</hi> of <hi>themſelves</hi> and <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, his frequent <hi>mockeries</hi> of the <hi>people</hi> in <hi>calling</hi> and <hi>diſſolving Parliaments,</hi> allowing them a face of freedom in point of <hi>election;</hi> but afterwards winnowing the <hi>Wheat</hi> from the Chaff, leaving few or none to ſit, but ſuch whoſe intereſt or principles engaged them to imploy their wits in the advancement of his Aimes; they being but the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-men to do the work, that was cut out by his Cabinet Junto, and as long as they acted in order to that <hi>end,</hi> they had good <hi>words</hi> and were <hi>feaſted,</hi> but if they ran Counter, then old <hi>Harry</hi> with his <hi>dagger,</hi> I mean <hi>Oliver</hi> would clap his hand upon his Sword or breaſt, and not onely threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten but diſſolve them; of the truth whereof we had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall examples.</p>
            <p>I need not mention that <hi>great juggle</hi> of the <hi>Act</hi> for <hi>Kingſhip,</hi> and his cunning denyall of the Title, (which was the onely thing he gaped for,) becauſe he ſaw ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſons in his Army, which though neerly related, did abominate his Apoſtacy; although by ſecret threats, and ingratiating promiſes, he did endeavour to allure them to a compliance with the actings of <hi>Parliament,</hi> with whom it is believed he was really angry, becauſe they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted his anſwer, whereas he expected that they ſhould

have both <hi>paſſed</hi> and <hi>impoſed</hi> that <hi>Title</hi> upon him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled him to <hi>plead neceſsity,</hi> as he did in aſſuming the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectorſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I fear if I ſhould mention any more of his <hi>good acts,</hi> I ſhould either <hi>tire</hi> or <hi>offend</hi> the <hi>Reader,</hi> and therefore I ſhall leave him to the obloquy that is due to a <hi>Tyrant</hi> and <hi>Uſurper,</hi> and proceed to the <hi>ſhort Reign</hi> of his <hi>ſucceſſor,</hi> who was a Gentleman that had very few other faults, but that he was his <hi>Son,</hi> and ſo unhappily became heire to the fruits of his Fathers Rapines and Oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>Under whoſe <hi>Government,</hi> the <hi>difference</hi> may eaſily be <hi>diſcerned</hi> betwixt the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> the firſt Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Councell,</hi> the ſecond being <hi>governed</hi> by the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>How the intereſts in that <hi>Convention</hi> (for I call them <hi>Parliaments,</hi> for <hi>form-ſake,</hi> not becauſe I judge them <hi>legall</hi>) their proceeds being but as of yeſterday, and ſo freſh in memory, I ſhall forbear to examine, onely by the <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,</hi> you may diſcerne the <hi>compoſition, for</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the <hi>Cavalier, royall Presbyter,</hi> and new Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, the <hi>Common-wealths party</hi> (notwithſtanding they had

almoſt all the <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> of the houſe on their ſides,) yet when it came to the Vote <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong</hi> it was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed againſt them, and ſuch Councells ſet on foot in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the heightning the <hi>pretended,</hi> but not <hi>intended Court;</hi> and oppreſſing the good people under the notion of <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and <hi>Sectaries, Quakers</hi> and the like, all men that were oppoſers of that intereſt, being charged with ſome capitall Character of diſtinction, thereby to render them marks of obloquy or ſubjects, of terrour and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. And in this, being ſtrengthened with an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the <hi>Conceſsions</hi> of the <hi>Protector,</hi> they were heightned to that confidence, that contrary to all <hi>reaſon</hi> or former <hi>preſident,</hi> they took upon them to impoſe upon the <hi>Army,</hi> by denying them the liberty of meeting together to conſult their affaires either as <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> or <hi>Souldiers,</hi> although but to <hi>Petition; the peoples right whereto hath been ſo publickly aſſerted, and conteſted for by former Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>

            <p>To mention theſe things, amongſt others then in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, the effect whereof we have now ſeen, although then under <hi>Covert,</hi> gave the <hi>Army</hi> juſt cauſe, not onely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Conſequences of thoſe <hi>Councells,</hi> with the <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> accrewing; but alſo to look back to their former <hi>act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Councells</hi> and <hi>engagements,</hi> and in order to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of impending troubles, which if the <hi>Parliament</hi> then ſitting were <hi>continued,</hi> would not onely be <hi>nouriſhed,</hi> but receive <hi>Countenance</hi> to the introduction of <hi>Monarchy, and ruine of all ſuch as had been the oppoſers thereof:</hi> and not onely ſo, but a gap muſt have been opened to a bloody perſecution of many thouſands of the good people of <hi>Engl.</hi> under the notion of <hi>Anabaptiſts, Seekers, Quakers</hi> and the like, many whereof though differing in judgement, are faithfull to God and ſerviceable to the nation. I ſay theſe conſiderations amongſt others induced them to preſs
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114988:17"/>
the Protector to conſent to their orderly diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which at length he granted, and cauſed to be done by Proclamation; thereby putting at that preſent a <hi>check</hi> to the <hi>deſign</hi> which now hath manifeſted it ſelf, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all manner of queſtion, had been on foot ſooner by ſome months, had that power been continued.</p>
            <p>Being freed from that fear, they caſt about for future ſecurity; and in order thereto by a <hi>Declaration</hi> invite the <hi>Parliament, called</hi> by the <hi>King, choſen</hi> by the <hi>people,</hi> and <hi>continued</hi> by a <hi>Law,</hi> made in <hi>full</hi> and <hi>free Parliament;</hi> who in the day of <hi>Englands</hi> greateſt ſtraits ſtood in the <hi>Gap,</hi> and on whoſe <hi>Councells</hi> and <hi>actions</hi> ſo perfect an <hi>Impreſſe</hi> of the <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>owning</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was engraven in indelible Characters; I ſay calling to mind what foundations of <hi>juſtice, freedom</hi> and <hi>ſecurity</hi> to all <hi>perſons,</hi> either <hi>fearing God</hi> or <hi>living peaceably,</hi> was by them laid in the ſettlement of a <hi>free-State</hi> without a <hi>King</hi> or <hi>houſe</hi> of <hi>Peers,</hi> they not onely invite them to the exerciſe of the power from which they were <hi>illegally forced</hi> by their <hi>late Generall,</hi> but alſo <hi>engage</hi> themſelves to ſtand by them and defend them againſt <hi>their</hi> and the Nations <hi>Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon their <hi>meeting</hi> or immediately after, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectorſhip ceaſes, and all things are reduced as nigh as may be to the order they were in, when the <hi>force</hi> was <hi>put</hi> upon <hi>them.</hi> I ſhall not trouble the Reader with a journall of their proceedings, ſince the Preſs abounds with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that nature; onely in reſpect I find much diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction upon the Spirits of ſome perſons that are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe well-affected, who ſcruple their <hi>right to the exerciſe of the Supreame Authority,</hi> and ſome ſuch other frothy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, I ſhall in a ſober manner offer to conſideration, the following particulars.</p>
            <p>1. That this Parliament was <hi>called</hi> by the <hi>Kings Writ,</hi> and <hi>freely choſen</hi> and <hi>ſent</hi> up by the <hi>Country,</hi> as their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:114988:17"/>
and as ſuch <hi>owned</hi> by the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Whereas it is objected that the <hi>death</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> did diſſolve them, it is anſwered; That it is true in all <hi>Parliaments</hi> but this: and had not they been continued by an <hi>act,</hi> the <hi>death</hi> of the <hi>King had diſſolved them alſo:</hi> but if the <hi>death</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> could not <hi>repeal</hi> that <hi>Statute</hi> which is undeniable, then is their <hi>power</hi> of <hi>ſitting warranted</hi> by <hi>Law,</hi> and in this caſe there is no <hi>Interregnum,</hi> otherwiſe by the ſame rule upon the <hi>death</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> all the Lawes of the Land muſt loſe their force, and the <hi>Government di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve into its first Choas,</hi> which were madneſs for any man to imagin.</p>
            <p>3. Whereas it is further alleadged, that although they were <hi>continued</hi> by an <hi>act,</hi> yet they were then a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>free Parliament,</hi> conſiſting of <hi>three Eſtates,</hi> according to the Ancient Conſtitution of <hi>England,</hi> it is anſwered; That the <hi>peoples Repreſentatives,</hi> the <hi>Commons</hi> Aſſembled in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> were the Originall Authors and Founders of that Conſtitution pleaded for; and as former <hi>Parliaments</hi> had the liberty of eſtabliſhing that <hi>form of Government,</hi> which in that Age might to them ſeem <hi>good</hi> and <hi>convenient,</hi> or at leaſt being under a <hi>force</hi> (notwithſtanding many ſtruglings to obtain their Freedomes,) were neceſſitated to take what the Tyrants would afford them; (the truth whereof the contentions between the Kings and people in all Ages, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the great Charter of Liberties, doth plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate;) I ſay be it upon which ſide ſoever, the peoples now Repreſentative, have as good a power to alter the form then eſtabliſhed, and to introduce a new one if by them deemed moſt ſuitable and advantageous, to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that intruſted them, as the former <hi>Parliaments</hi> had to eſtabliſh that; otherwiſe the power of repeal of Lawes, though never ſo deſtructive to the people is taken from them; and they that upon the cleareſt principle of reaſon
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114988:18"/>
and Law, are the moſt proper judges, are rendred but Cyphers altogether uſeleſs and unneceſſary.</p>
            <p>But as to the main part of the objection, the <hi>Parliament</hi> conſiſted <hi>of three Eſtates,</hi> viz. <hi>Lords Spirituall, Lords Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall</hi> and <hi>Commons;</hi> for in the Conſtitution of our <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> I do wholly exclude the <hi>King,</hi> who is in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Law deemed <hi>Major ſingulis, ſed minor univerſis,</hi> and ſo cannot be brought into ballance with the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> who according to the practiſe of former Ages before the Conqueſt, (to which Governments the Conquerers ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted) <hi>Parliaments</hi> were the great and onely Concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, by whoſe Councells the <hi>Kings</hi> were wholly direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they having onely a power of adviſing with, but not of impoſing upon the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as to the election or repeal of Lawes, as by Ancient Records if examined will evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare, the late practice now pleaded as a principle, having by degrees been introduced and impoſed on the people; and that which was a violation of their Charter of Liberties, onely warranted by Cuſtom, againſt Law. But now there are no Lords, and not half the number of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> that by the Law is allowed to conſtitute an Houſe. It is anſwered, That when the <hi>Parliament</hi> was thus <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted</hi> and <hi>continued</hi> with one <hi>conſent,</hi> they agreed in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> wherein they unanimouſly declared, not onely what were the Grievances of the Nation, by reaſon of the <hi>miſgovernment</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>evil Council,</hi> but do alſo engage themſelves to act as one man for the reformation of the abuſes both in Church and State; and this I call the <hi>Good old Cauſe,</hi> at firſt <hi>owned</hi> and <hi>aſſerted</hi> by the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In their endeavours to accompliſh theſe ends, underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſo <hi>ſolemnly</hi> and upon ſuch <hi>ſerious grounds,</hi> they meet with many obſtructions; and the <hi>King</hi> endeavouring to protect Delinquents, by <hi>forſaking</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114988:18"/>
               <hi>leavying</hi> of <hi>war,</hi> many of the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> that had eſpouſed the ſaid good <hi>cauſe,</hi> and in their <hi>judgments decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> it to be <hi>ſo,</hi> baſeſly apoſtatized, and joyned with the <hi>King</hi> againſt the <hi>Parliament,</hi> of whom they were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and with whom they had engaged for the obtaining a <hi>Reformation;</hi> and I hope if they were called by Writ to ſit at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> without an adjournment of the whole, they could not upon any legal account ſet up a Juncto at <hi>York</hi> or <hi>Oxford;</hi> and in doing thereof, I hope it will not be denied, but that they juſtly forfeited their <hi>priviledge</hi> as <hi>Members,</hi> and brought themſelves under the judgment of the Parliament for ſuch their <hi>treaſonable deſertion.</hi> And thus one part of your <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> ſo much plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, are rightfully diveſted of that Authority.</p>
            <p>As to your Lords Spiritual, They were thoſe that had introduced thoſe <hi>Innovations in Church-worſhip;</hi> and in order to the ſupporting themſelves therein, had ſet on foot the <hi>Scotch war;</hi> and therefore when they ſaw the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament endeavouring to ſtrike at the root, and that they, as principal inſtruments in miſ-leading the <hi>King,</hi> were like to feel the <hi>laſh</hi> of the <hi>Law;</hi> they being back'd by a part of the <hi>Lords</hi> Temporal and <hi>Commons</hi> engaged in the ſame <hi>compact,</hi> make a <hi>protest</hi> againſt the Proceedings of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and for that unparallell'd and treaſonable breach of Priviledge are committed to the Tower; and as Obſtructers and Hinderers of that <hi>good work</hi> of <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> by a reſolve of both Houſes are diſabled to ſit in Parliament: neither did I ever hear or read that that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion was deemed illegal.</p>
            <p>The two Houſes being by this time much leſſened in number, though not in power, they tranſacted together in the management of the War againſt the King and his evil Council, &amp; ſtill in all their Declarations, Propoſitions and Treaties inſiſt upon the ſame Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114988:19"/>
of abuſes both in Church and State, and offer ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſuitable expedients for redreſs thereof.</p>
            <p>The <hi>war</hi> being ended, they that in the <hi>wilderneſſe</hi> were <hi>united,</hi> being in <hi>Canaan</hi> in peace, began to <hi>divide,</hi> as to the manner of doing what both <hi>parties</hi> agreed <hi>convenient</hi> to be <hi>done.</hi> Theſe diviſions made the Chariot-wheels go heavily, and what <hi>Reaſon</hi> could not <hi>prevail</hi> in, <hi>Faction</hi> muſt; a <hi>corrupt</hi> party, as aforeſaid, in both Houſes endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, for by-ends, to prevaricate, and after all the <hi>bloud</hi> and <hi>treaſure</hi> ſpent to obtain the forementioned ends, they endeavour to bring in the <hi>King</hi> meerly to gratifie their own <hi>particular intereſts,</hi> wholly waving the <hi>publick cauſe</hi> ſo much before contended for: and in order to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ſaid end, becauſe they could not obtain it by <hi>Vote,</hi> they bring a <hi>force</hi> upon the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate the <hi>Speaker</hi> and other the Members of the Houſe, that oppoſed their proceedings, to flye to the Army for protection; and not onely ſo, but in all their future act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and debates in the Houſe, endeavour to divide the <hi>Army,</hi> and introduce the <hi>King</hi> by a clandeſtine Treaty, ſet on foot in the Iſle of <hi>Wight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> after <hi>Hamiltons</hi> invaſion by the <hi>Kings Commiſsion,</hi> whereby he had not onely ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred himſelf an <hi>implacable enemy,</hi> but alſo a perſon not to be truſted, having made and broke ſuch ſolemn engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to the hazard of the <hi>Nations peace,</hi> and great <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence</hi> of <hi>bloud</hi> and <hi>treaſure,</hi> thereby juſtly engaging both <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Army</hi> to a reſolution of proceeding againſt him according to <hi>Juſtice;</hi> which being for the reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid oppoſed by the ſaid corrupt royal party, and all their actings being diametrically oppoſite to the <hi>peace</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> and <hi>priviledge</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> they were kept out by a party of the <hi>Army</hi> appointed for that purpoſe, <hi>and that Excluſion confirmed by the Parliament,</hi> who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly are the <hi>judges</hi> of their own Members, and may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114988:19"/>
as <hi>many</hi> or <hi>whom</hi> they pleaſe, if any <hi>juſt cauſe</hi> appear to them for ſo doing.</p>
            <p>And as to the five or ſix Lords remaining in the Upper Houſe, who, its from good reaſon believed, had never ſtaid with the Parliament ſo long, if they had judged their intereſt as conſiderable on the Kings party. If either the principles upon which they were eſtabliſhed, <hi>viz.</hi> The will of the King, or their frequent actings, not onely to ballance but overtop the intereſt of the people in their Repreſentatives, by denial to paſs many other good Laws propoſed by Parliament, as well as the Act againſt <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> but alſo their challenging and exerciſing an arbitrary juriſdiction over the lives and liberties of Commoners, over whom by Law they had no power or cognizance, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the ſubverſion of that Government, by the which they pretended to ſtand as Peers: I ſay, if theſe things be conſidered, it cannot be denyed to be as legal an Act as ever the Parliament did, when they voted them uſeleſs and unneceſſary, and reduced the Power to its firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, viz. <hi>To the ſupreme</hi> Authority <hi>the people,</hi> in their <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> the <hi>Parliament;</hi> neither can it by <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Law</hi> be alledged, that all or any theſe Mutations, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Interruptions ſhould take away or deſtroy their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal power, if there remained but Two and forty, although it be evident that there remaineth a far greater number, and <hi>ſuch too,</hi> as in all the Nations Troubles have been moſt eminent for <hi>Piety, Integrity</hi> and <hi>Stability,</hi> in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples tending to <hi>Freedom</hi> and <hi>Security.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might hereto adde the ſignal bleſſing of God upon all their <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Actings,</hi> in ſo much, that not one <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon formed,</hi> or <hi>deſign</hi> ſet on foot againſt them, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered; <hi>but they have had cauſe of rejoycing, while their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have been aſhamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I find another Objection, and that is newly ſprung
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114988:20"/>
up, <hi>viz.</hi> That they were not onely diſſolved by their <hi>General,</hi> but ſubmitted to the power of the <hi>Protector,</hi> owned and acted under the <hi>Government</hi> as <hi>Members</hi> in his <hi>Parliaments,</hi> as they call them, and as <hi>Juſtices</hi> of the <hi>peace,</hi> and the like, <hi>and therefore their power of ſitting as a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt needs ceaſe.</hi> To which I anſwer, That their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant might and did by force interrupt them, but could not diſſolve them, becauſe he had not power to repeal that law made for their Continuance; and it is worth obſervance, how he and his Accomplices were infatuated, in that in all his <hi>Conventions</hi> (in ſome of which he had power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) he never attempted the repeal of that Statute, which, although ſuch a repeal could not have been legal, yet it would have given ſome color to this Objection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the <hi>Law</hi> being <hi>continued,</hi> they could not be legally diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And as to the other part of the Objection, it is fit to diſtinguiſh between <hi>Generals</hi> and <hi>Individuals.</hi> I do believe that ſome particular Members might and did act under his power, as <hi>John</hi> or <hi>Thomas,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but not as a Parliament;</hi> the actions of one, or ſome few, not being to be applied to the whole. I confeſs, had the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of <hi>ſuch</hi> and <hi>ſo many</hi> Members, acted in order to the ſupport of his <hi>Tyranny,</hi> or ſubmitted to his <hi>Authority,</hi> by tranſacting with him, the caſe had been clear; but their actings as <hi>Individuals,</hi> while under a force, and that being upon principles of <hi>neceſsity,</hi> ſubmitted to, onely to gain an opportunity to ſtruggle for recovery of their <hi>freedom;</hi> I would fain know upon what principles of Law or Reaſon this can be judged a <hi>Diſſolution;</hi> but its no news for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented perſons to create <hi>cavils,</hi> and then diſperſe them as material principles of <hi>Reaſon;</hi> whereas if they were but duly conſidered, they would appear to be but <hi>vain Chymira's,</hi> vented on purpoſe to occaſion <hi>diſputes,</hi> and foment <hi>troubles</hi> and <hi>diviſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:114988:20"/>But the former is backt by another conſiderable <hi>plea</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Power, and that's <hi>the encreaſe of Taxes;</hi> and this ſeems to make an exceeding great noiſe, catches every ear, &amp; furniſhes diſcourſe for every buſy tongue, that otherwiſe would be at a loſs for <hi>news</hi> to tell in a <hi>Tavern</hi> or <hi>Alehouſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the increaſe of <hi>Taxes</hi> you may thank your <hi>ſelves</hi> and not the <hi>Parliament:</hi> for pray remember in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition you were, when they had that force put upon them, as to <hi>peace, trade at home,</hi> and <hi>credit abroad,</hi> nothing lying upon you but an ordinary <hi>Tax</hi> and moderate <hi>Exciſe;</hi> and yet then as certain a charge lay upon the State, in reſpect of the <hi>Dutch war,</hi> (powerful Navies being exceeding chargeable) as ever the late Powers could pretend to; and yet ſtill ſome publick debts were paid, as well as the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> and <hi>Navies;</hi> ſo that in a ſhort time <hi>England</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable hopes of great eaſe, as to an <hi>abatement</hi> of their <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes,</hi> eſpecially if an as honourable and advantageous peace had been made with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as this Power propoſed &amp; inſiſted on, and for denyal whereof they undertook that war. But if you remember further, there hath been a <hi>Spaniſh war,</hi> ſet on foot without the <hi>conſent</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and therein not onely many mens lives loſt, but much Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure hath been expended; and not onely ſo, but vaſt debts at home, and arrears abroad, contracted and owing both to the Armies and Navies, beſides the charge of a Court (for the inferiour part of it) more luxurious than the Kings: By all which means great debts now lie upon the Parliament, although you know what an exceeding great encreaſe of <hi>Exciſe</hi> was granted by one of his <hi>Conventions,</hi> to the diſcouragement (if not ruine) of Trade: now, I ſay, this was <hi>Englands,</hi> nay, give me leave to ſpeak it to the <hi>ſhame of many,</hi> it was even the fault of thoſe, <hi>who had moſt reaſon to aſſert the parliamentary intereſt,</hi> had not we <hi>repined,</hi> and like <hi>ignorant children</hi> eagerly deſired a <hi>change,</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:114988:21"/>
in expectation of <hi>better things,</hi> we had not in this manner <hi>met with worſe:</hi> neither had the <hi>General,</hi> though his <hi>Army</hi> had been united to him, (which we know for the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity were ſurprized) dared to have attempted their <hi>diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or his own <hi>uſurpation;</hi> but we, like a company of <hi>weather-cocks,</hi> are now ſo <hi>Frenchified,</hi> that every new <hi>Fingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fangle</hi> takes <hi>us,</hi> and we are more ready to run with our <hi>flattering addreſſes</hi> to them that forge <hi>ſtrong chains</hi> for our <hi>heels,</hi> (I might ſay, <hi>hearts</hi>) than thoſe that endeavour to <hi>recover</hi> and <hi>ſecure</hi> our <hi>freedoms.</hi> I need not mention the preſent occaſion, the charge is viſible in your eyes. Now pray <hi>how</hi> ſhall theſe <hi>debts</hi> be <hi>paid?</hi> The <hi>decay</hi> of <hi>Trade,</hi> which you all experience and complain of, renders the Revenue of the <hi>Customs</hi> and <hi>Exciſe</hi> very inconſiderable, and what other Incomes may happen is uncertain; you ſee there be <hi>enemies</hi> at <hi>home,</hi> and you have reaſon to ſuſpect <hi>foes</hi> from <hi>abroad;</hi> beſides the viſible neceſſity of a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſtrength, to ballance the <hi>diſcontents</hi> of <hi>honeſt men,</hi> who, as the caſe ſtands, <hi>are hardly to be truſted with the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their own peace:</hi> now, I ſay, upon all theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, how can you charge the <hi>Parliament?</hi> You would have a <hi>Protector,</hi> and ſtill ſtrive for a <hi>King;</hi> nothing but a <hi>ſingle perſon</hi> will pleaſe you: and yet although you lay all theſe foundations to contract <hi>debts,</hi> you are loth to have any hand in the payment: but <hi>ſoft</hi> and <hi>fair, ſelf do, ſelf have;</hi> if you will have <hi>Princes</hi> you muſt <hi>maintain them,</hi> and if your <hi>diſcontents</hi> endanger the <hi>peace,</hi> it is a neceſſary duty, incumbent upon the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to keep an <hi>Army</hi> to prevent you. <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> are almoſt turn'd <hi>Bedlamites,</hi> and, were not the Laſh threatned, <hi>Harmony</hi> would be turn'd to <hi>Diſcord, Cain</hi> would ſlay poor <hi>Abel,</hi> and all Parties, like <hi>Sampſon</hi> and the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> would dye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>though probably their expectations may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</hi>
