         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And as euerie commonweale is happie wherein ſubiects are good, ſo in good commonweales no ſubiect can be vnfortunate: yet what doth worke the welfare of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweales and people, is and hath beene (euen among the most learned,) long diſputed. Some ſuppoſe it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of goodlawes: others haue thought that ciuill education doth enforme it: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers imagined that the temperature of the heauens doth make men apt for ciuill life: ſome alſo do thinke it proceedeth from the endeuour of good kings: becauſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects by imitation of their Princes vertue, do (for the moſt part) become like vnto them.

               </gap>forming of which entent, I haue thought good to ſounde the depth of ciuile knowledge, and with greate diligence haue ſerched the ſecrets of moſt excellent Phyloſophers, not meaning to ſet forth any fained conceipt, but that which accordeth with authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of wiſe law makers and graue Councellors. I doe therefore thinke expedient, that in the perſon of our Councellor, there ſhoulde be ſuch ripeneſſe of age as might exerciſe the vertues beſeeming ſo honourable a perſonage, and in his calling, holde ſo greate a grauitie and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

as all other Citizens and ſubiectes may hope at his hande to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue comfort, quiet, &amp; councell profitable to the whole commonwealth. My intent is not to frame an <hi>Idaea,</hi> or Councellor imagined, ſuch a one as cannot be ſeene but onely in conceipt, or that the heauens haue ſkantly any ſo perfect, or the earth doth not containe any ſhadowe of ſuch a man; (as did <hi>Plato</hi> in his common weale and <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Orator) but our ſpeach ſhall tende to thinges poſſible, not exceeding the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie vſe of men. Yet my meaning is to gather into this booke, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer hath heeretofore beene ſpoken, knowen, or founde, eyther by learning of ſchooles, by Councels in commonweales, by pollicy, in gouernmente, by forraine experience by the Hiſtories, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the qualitie and perfection of a Councellor. And as <hi>Plato</hi> hath ſet downe thoſe things which he thought fitteſt for the felicitie of his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the like will we doe in the diſcription of our Councellor: and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining to haue mett with wiſe men of all nations, Cities and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales repayring to a market of wiſedome, we will take from euery one, ſuch vertues, cuſtomes, lawes and dueties, as ſeemeth to vs moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and therewith furniſh our Councellor. But for ſo much as through the diuerſitie of commonweales, it ſeemeth that the quality and offices of Councellors be diuers, we haue iudged that forme of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale to be of all others moſt iuſt and indifferent, where the Kinges authoritie and the peoples power, by the councellors wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and aduiſe is qualefied. We haue therefore thought fitt, firſt to diſcourſe the diuerſitie of commonweales, as well in kinde as forme, of their felicitie, of the happineſſe of ſubiectes, of the education and inſtruction of a Councellor, to the ende he may the rather vnderſtand the ſtate where he gouerneth, and be skilfull in the precepts of vertue. So as in that ſort furniſhed, he may direct his life in all honeſty, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruingly be aduanced to a charge of ſo greate honour and reputation. And we will, that the vertues of our Councellor be ſuch, as are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie profitable for the gouerment of one ſtate, but ſhall be of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celencie as the ſame may be practiſed in the proceedings of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

Therefore from ſuch a wiſe man, and ſuch a ciuill ſcience, wee haue determined to take matter, whereof to frame our excellent Councellor.</p>

Among all creatures contayned within the circle of the earth, that which we call man, is the chiefeſt and of moſt reputation. For he alone, of all other liuing thinges of what nature ſo euer, is made not onely an inhabitant and Citizen of the world, but alſo a Lorde and Prince therein. Which authoritie, honour and greatneſſe, from God the ſupreame gouernour of heauen and earth is giuen, who hath alſo vouchſafed to receiue him, as it were a companion in the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this vniuerſall Citie common to God and men, adorning him with diuine vnderſtanding, to the end that through his godly reaſon and councell, this worldly Empyre, might be wiſely, holily and iuſtly gouerned.

Citizen therein, ſhall become vnhappy and miſerable. For in vaine it were to ſtudie the welfare of any ſtate, if God be not the defendour and keeper thereof. It may then be conceyued; that all vertue and wiſedome of man proceedeth from God, which was the cauſe that our aunceſtors in times paſt, were wont to dedicate publique temples to vertue, faith, concord, wiſedome, and peace. But are the Councels of gouermente to be asked of God? or ought all requeſtes and prayers, aſwell for ſmall as greate graces, aſcende vnto his heauenly hearing? Yea ſurely. So that our ſuite and prayers doe not diſcente form reaſon. Good lawes therefore are obtayned at Gods handes by interceſſion of wiſe men, and not by holding vppe the handes of fooles, or be their lowde cries, or proſtrating their bodies vppon the earth. For God is onely preſent with wiſe men, and as <hi>Ouidius</hi> ſaith well.

God by his heauenly prouidence hath appointed, that the powers of mans minde ſhoulde reſt in three ſundry partes of his bodie; ſeeming thereby to repreſent three <hi>Idaeas</hi> or formes of commonweales, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting reaſon as King to haue his abiding in the heade &amp; hieſt part, as one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lorde and Prince to commaund all. The ſecond part as vigilant and readie to obey, hee hath placed neere vnto it in the breaſte, making the ſame as a companion and helper vnto the heade. <hi>Plato</hi> calleth it <hi>vis iraſcendi,</hi> and <hi>affectuum ſedes.</hi> The thirde reſembling a multitude, witleſſe, frowarde, and full of ſenſuall deſires, hee hath harboured beneath the hearte, ſecluded farre from both the other. In theſe parts of our ſoule (as in an image) wee may beholde three formes of commonweales. The higheſt hath the place of king, as deſtined and appoynted to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde all, the ſeconde though in place inferiour, yet in quality is of no leſſe regarde, beeing well obeyed. For where reaſon ruleth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the guarde and ayde of the affections, all actions are weake and <note place="margin">Reaſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, feable</note>without force. Euen ſo a Senate not aſſiſted by reaſon, which partlie as Captayne, and partly as Soldiour in all actions and conſultations is vſed, becommeth fearefull and effeminate. <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided the power of reaſon, making one parte abſolute and ſtanding vppon it ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other as it were depending and ſeruing, like vnto a ſonne that obeyeth his Father.

But hee that can neyther councell himſelfe, nor knoweth howe to followe an other mans aduiſe, is of all others, of leaſt wiſedome and capacitie. As touching the <hi>Optimatie,</hi> it hath not onely the force of reaſon, but in all actions is helped and incouraged by the affections, as the Poets haue written.

For the authoritie of the father ouer his children, may be likened to principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: becauſe the children are the fathers charge. He alone muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for them all, and their faultes are by him rather chaſtiſed then ſeuerely puniſhed. In like manner ought a good king to behaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe towarde his ſubiectes. Therefore <hi>Iupiter</hi> the God of Gods and men, is by <hi>Homer</hi> called Father. The husbandes authoritie ouer his wife may be compared to the <hi>Optimatie.</hi> For the husband ought to gouerne his wife according to iuſtice, and commaunde her to doe thinges honeſt. The populer ſtate is likened to brotherly ſocietie. For they ought to liue in equality, differing onely in the degrees of age. But as the Father that vſeth his children wickedly, cruelly and vnnatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is reputed a tyrant and no father: Euen ſo a king that ſtudieth for priuate commodity oppreſſing his ſubiectes, contemning his lawes, and liuing diſhonorably, doth loſe the name of a King and is called a Tyrante. Alſo a husband and wife liuing in diſcorde, eyther through negligence or wilfulneſſe reiecting the care of their children and houſeholde, doe thereby abuſe their authoritie and become vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the name of naturall parentes. In like manner brethren diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing and quarrelling, neglecting the common profite, and giuing <note place="margin">By euill go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerment, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales are chaunged.</note>themſelues to ſlouth or laſciuious life, are not to be accounted bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.

The Monarchie or kingdome, becommeth a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie. The <hi>Optimatie,</hi> is reduced vnder the authoritie of a fewe. The popular common weale is conuerted into plebeiall inſolencie. Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie (which the <hi>Graecians</hi> call <hi>Politeia,</hi> and is by <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called <hi>Reſpublica popularis,)</hi> may be referred to all kindes of commonweales well gouerned, becauſe that worde is vniuerſall and includeth all ciuill gouernment. <hi>Plato</hi> addeth a ſeuenth kinde of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, <note place="margin">The opinion of Plato touching kinges.</note>that is to witt, A King ſubiect to his lawes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> making a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie of two ſortes, and conſequently framing two Kinges, the one bounde and confined, the other free and not reſtrayned to anie lawe. This is the opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> touching Monarchie. The power &amp; autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie (ſaith he) of one Prince gouerning with good lawes, is among the ſixe kindes of commonweales, the beſt and moſt perfect. But ſuch

gouerment being without lawes, is heauy, &amp; hard to thoſe that liue therin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet if the other ſtates be alſo without lawes, that is the beſt, the ſeuenth except. For a King gouerning in that ſorte, is of all other gouernours to be obeyed and honoured as a GOD among men. The diuerſitie of commonweals doth not proceed from fortune, nor the diſpoſition of the heauens, but euery gouernment is framed according to the mindes of <note place="margin">Euery gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought be framed according to the men, and place.</note>men, their wits and education. Alſo the varietie not onely of mens incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, but alſo the nature of commonweales is made diuers, through the diuerſitie of countries, their climate and beeing. What ſhall I ſay of ſedicions, warre, and factions? for they oftimes doe vtterly ſubuert commonweales, or chaunge them into ſtates contrariwiſe gouerned. Such is the condition of worldly thinges, that miſchance ſtandeth next to good fortune, and vice is mixed with vertue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo as with facilitie men fall from good into euill. Sometimes it alſo happeneth, that common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales well framed, through euill miniſters are eyther extinguiſhed, or altered into other formes of gouerment. Hereof it commeth that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes become <hi>Tyranies; Optimaties</hi> are made the gouerment of a fewe, and populer ſtates are conuerted into licentious liberty, and from that, brought backe vnto <hi>Tyranie. Plato</hi> writeth that the change of common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales is fatall, through diſpoſition of the heauens and planets. The variations of ſtates doe alſo otherwhiles proceede from the varietie of <note place="margin">What ſorts of men are fit for euerye kinde of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For in ſome ſtate there be many rich men, in others many poore, in others plentie of noble men, ſoldiers and ploughmen, in others plenty of merchants, craftes men and artificers. Then whenſoeuer the number of merchants, artifizants and ploughmen doe ſurmount the reſt, that ſtate moſt commonly beeommeth popular: But where rich men are moſt plentifull, there groweth the gouerment of a fewe great men. Where the moſt part of Citizens be good men, wiſe and vertuous, that ſtate is apt to be gouerned as an <hi>Optimatie.</hi> There are three thinges (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> thinketh) which contende for the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Libertie, Riches,</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi> For nobilitie, (which holdeth the fourth place) is companion both to vertue and riches, becauſe the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall mixture of rich and poore men, is called a popular ſtate. A faction onely of rich men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is named the gouerment of a fewe, and the conſent of all three, that is to ſay, free men, rich men, and good men, is accounted an <hi>Optimatie.</hi> Such a one was the <hi>Carthagenian</hi> commonweale for riche men, good men, and noble men, were therein equally eſteemed.

Thus haue wee diſcouered all kinde of common weales, which either by mans experience haue beene founde, or by the induſtry of law makers or Philoſophers coulde bee deuiſed; but which of them is moſt perfect and excellent, cannot (as hath before beene ſaide) eaſilie be determined. For there is no man that preferreth and praiſeth not the ſtate wherein he <note place="margin">What people doe moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly obey the king.</note>was borne and bredde. Some more willingly doe liue in kingdomes then any other ſtate, who are chiefely ſuch men as are naturallie apt to honour thoſe, that be virtuous and fitte for action. The <hi>Cappadoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> hauing many ages liued vnder kinges (whoſe raſe was extinguiſhed) were offred by the <hi>Romaines,</hi> to haue their ſtate conuerted into popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar libertie, but they refuſed it. Then the <hi>Romaines</hi> appointed <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obarſanes</hi> their friende to bee King of <hi>Cappadocia.</hi> The contrary courſe was followed by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> for they affecting a popular ſtate, would neither conſent to be gouerned by one nor many.

For they not forgetting the <note place="margin">The beſt com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon weale is, where the people be beſt ordered.</note>condition of their gouernment, are content by turnes aſwell to obey as commaunde. But let vs nowe diſcourſe of the beſt common weales. Whoſoeuer ſhall take in hande to ſpeake thereof, it behoueth him firſt to vnderſtande what is the beſt kinde and order of life. For being ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ignorant, a perfect commonweale cannot be conceiued. It ſtandeth him alſo vpon to vnderſtand, by what meanes men be brought to good order of liueing. For the ſtate is alvvaies like vnto the men that liue therein, but which kinde of life ought bee accounted beſt the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers haue not by conſent determined. The <hi>Stoicks,</hi> the <hi>Peripatetickes</hi> &amp; the <hi>Epicures</hi> doe diuerſlie iudge of that matter, and into diuers ſectes and opinions haue deuided the vvorlde.

Wee therefore accounte their preceptes to bee moſt profitable, aſvvell for men as common vveales.

which we miſlike not, ſo as therewith they conſent, that to the vſe of vertue men haue neede of externall goods, which both nature and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune haue made for vſe of man, to the ende he might become the more happy, better and perfect.

Moreouer if all good things doe tende to mans felicitie, it is requiſite to haue of them abundance, which whoſoeuer hath, muſt vnderſtand, that onely for himſelfe he was not borne, but (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) his country, his friendes, his kinsfolke and aliance doe claime their ſhare in the fruites of his felicitie, becauſe to euery of them, if he will be thought happye, it behooueth him to giue part, not onely of his treaſure of minde, as iuſtice and wiſedome, but alſo of all other thinges beſtowed on him for the vſe and life of man. The liberall man needeth money to performe the actions of liberality, and the iuſt man therewith muſt reward, and make ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The valiantman requireth force and powre, to be therby inabled to execute ſomewhat worthy his vertue. The temperate man asketh au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and liberty, wherby he might ſhew himſelfe to be ſuch a one. The <note place="margin">Mans life of three ſortes.</note>Philoſophers affirme, that there are three ſortes of life. The firſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in action, the ſecond in contemplation, and the thirde in pleaſure, which beeing exerciſed in luſtes and licentiouſnes, is beaſtly and proper to men of baſeſt condition. That which reſteth in action<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnleſſe it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo accompanied with wiſedome and vertue, proueth improfitable, and is ſubiect to great vices and imperfections. That which is imployed in contemplation, not beieng ioyned with ſome action, becommeth vaine and without effect. For as men that earneſtly behold the brightnes of the ſunne, with the vehement heat and light thereof are made blinde: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo the minde of man continually wrought with imagimations &amp; ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of hie myſteries, doth become dull, heauy and languiſhing. Who ſo therefore deſireth to liue vertuouſly and happely, muſt participate both of the ciuill and philoſophicall liues, which are action and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.

The mixture of which two, doth make man to be like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to GOD, bleſſed and fortunate. For hee that vſeth his minde to the cogitation of thinges diuine, is thereby made moſte acceptable to GOD, who doth greatelye eſteeme of thoſe men, that liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſpirite and reaſon; becauſe it appeareth thereby, that they labour to bee like vnto him, who is alſo a ſpirite, and thinges of one nature doe willinglye conioyne in loue.

All men therefore through force of good lawes, ought be trained vnto happy life, for by ſuch meanes, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales become good and bleſſed. Let vs nowe conſider with which of theſe three ſtates firſt remembred, the diuine and happy life doth beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, which beeing knowen, the face and forme of a perfect common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale <note place="margin">What things are chiefly conſidered in the election of kinges.</note>is eaſily diſcerned. To the election of kinges men are induced, by their vertue, and beholding their egregious actes. For whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we ſee a man to excell in thoſe thinges, wee accounte him as a God among men, and forthwith conſent to make him king, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the common prouerbe. <hi>Rexeris, ſirecte facies.</hi> Becauſe that gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is iuſt, where the gouernour is vertuous, commaunding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and ruling his ſubiectes, not as as Maiſter gouerneth his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes, but as a father ruleth his children. The <hi>Athenians</hi> (as <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes</hi> in his oration againſt <hi>Neaera</hi> writeth) when <hi>Theſeus</hi> had fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their commonweale, were wonte to chooſe ſome one of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous number, and by holding vp their handes elected him Kinge. In olde time, the election of kinges was among all people holden a thing diuine and holy. <hi>Romulus</hi> after the ſight of twelue Rauens, (as <hi>Liuius</hi> ſayeth) or rather becauſe the lightning had pearced his bodie, from the lefte to the right ſide; (as <hi>Dioniſius</hi> writeth) was by diuination choſen king, which was the reſpecte, that by lawe it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, that no man ſhoulde take vppon him any magiſtracie or be made kinge, without diuination. In ſo much as that ordinance cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Ius Auspiciorum</hi> was obeyed and religiouſlye obſerued.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7093:11"/>
and mainteynour of the commonweale. The anciente <hi>Latines</hi> called their Kinges <hi>Indigetes,</hi> that is to ſaye, deified, (as <hi>Eneas</hi> and <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> were) whoſe bodies after death coulde neuer be founde. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of kinges, was in time paſte proper to the moſte vertuous people, vnto whome the gouernment of Tyrantes was odious. Yea the ancient lawe of God, doth as it were allowe, or rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende <note place="margin">Optimacy.</note>the gouernment of one. An <hi>Optimatie</hi> conſiſteth of vertuous Citizens, who deſerue commendation in reſpecte of vertue, becauſe they gouerne the commonweale, as becommeth good men, in no <note place="margin">Popular ſtates.</note>wiſe digreſſing from the rule and line of lawe. In popular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweales all thinges be contrarilie handled: for libertie beeing the ende thereof, the ſtate is ruled according to will, and popular furie, moſt commonly without vertue and reaſon. In ſuch Cities men are called good, becauſe they are profitable to the commonweale, not for that they are indued with honeſtie, which confiſteth in action of vertue: So as vertue is meaſured, not by honeſtie, but by common profite and libertie. For popular iuſtice (called <hi>Ius populare)</hi> is, where the honours are giuen, not according to vertue of him that receiueth them, but the number of thoſe that giue them, who thinke thoſe thinges not to bee iuſt which by iuſtice ought be, but that which to the greateſt number doth ſeeme iuſt, eſteeming that alſo to be honourable, which by popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar fame is accounted glorious. Therefore although in all ſortes of commonweales the lawes of vertue are ſometimes peruerted, yet doth the ſame moſt commonly happen in popular ſtates. For if any good man liuing there, ſhall happen to miſlike the plebeyall life, and doth labour by admoniſhing, reprehending, and correcting the Citizens, to reduce them to honeſty and vertue, he is forthwith iudged an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to liberty, and by the law <hi>Ostraciſmo</hi> areſted, and many times put to death. With this kind of perſecution, many notable Citizens inhabiting the popular ſtates of <hi>Graecia</hi> were afflicted, as <hi>Cymon, Ariſtides, Thucydides, Socrates, Themistocles,</hi> and <hi>Damon:</hi> alſo in <hi>Rome, Camillus</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> were in like manner handled.

               <hi>Plato</hi> vſeth that ſpeach before of vs remembred, that no ſtate doth continue, beeing go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned with Iron or Braſſe, that is to ſay, by fooliſh men, borne ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to obey then commaunde. For they after ſome fortunate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of warre, taking vnto them loftie mindes, haue at hande tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and popular Captaines to extoll and commende their vertue.

For through diuerſitie of minds, thoſe men become voyde of councell, and after much inſolencie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and faction, they yeelde their obedience eyther to a fewe, or ſome one mightie perſonage. So did the people of <hi>Athens</hi> which beeing author of the victorie by ſea, againſt the <hi>Medians,</hi> puffed vp with pride of that fortune, ſtirred greate troubles and ſeditions in that ſtate, and all good Citizens laboured in vaine to preuente that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe. Alſo the originall of popular ſtates, doth ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede of Rebellion attempted againſt the nobilitie: as it many times happened in <hi>Rome:</hi> when the people tooke armes againſt the Kings and Senate. Sometimes alſo the cauſe of ſuch popular gouerment, proceedeth through good ſucceſſe of ſome action enterpriſed by the people. Who taking vppon them the minde of Lordes, doe vſurpe the ſtate, as did the <hi>Athenians</hi> when they had vanquiſhed the <hi>Medians,</hi> and as the <hi>Romaines</hi> hauing ouerthrowne the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginenſes.</hi> The ſame alſo otherwhiles chanſeth, when the people is made deſperate, by tyrannie of their Prince and gouernours, for then by force of armes, or oppreſſion of their king, they frame a forme of gouernment among themſelues, which in our dayes the <hi>Swiſſeis</hi> haue done.

manie times gouerned iuſtlie and poletiquelye, but the ſame wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting lawes or conſente of the people, doth not merite the name of a commonweale.

Thus haue we diſcourſed the diuers formes of commonweales, with the natures &amp; diſpoſition of men there liuing.

This, for that therein moſt good men doe exerciſe the publique functions: and that, becauſe the publique commoditie is preſerued by one with gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conſente of minde. So as if any doe excell the reſte, to him the commonweale is committed. In theſe two ſtates men doe liue beſt, becauſe the order of them doth not onely preſerue Cities, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo make the Citizens happie. Some men haue thought the moſte perfect commonweale, ſhould be tempered and framed of all the three eſtates. Which is the cauſe, that they preferre the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment <note place="margin">The forme of the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale.</note>being compounded of the nobilitie, (which was the <hi>Senators)</hi> of the authoritie of one, (which was the King) and of the people (which were the <hi>Ephori.)</hi> For they were alwaies choſen among the <note place="margin">The Romane ſtate.</note>number of popular men. <hi>Polibius</hi> extolleth the <hi>Romane</hi> ſtate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it conſiſted of the King, the Nobilitie, and the people; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that the king for feare of the people, coulde not become inſolente, and the people durſte not diſobeye him, in reſpecte of the Senate. Which forme of commonweale was with good reaſon accounted moſt iuſt. For as perfect harmonie is compounded, of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7093:12"/>
treble, meane, and baſe tewnes: euen ſo a good commonweale, and the ſureſt agreement amongeſt men, is (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) made by mixture of the beſt, the meane, and the baſe people. We are alſo of opinion, that commonweale is perfect, which containeth good and vertuous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſubiectes, and is gouerned by a king, a Senate, and conſent of the people; wiſhing the King ſhould obſerue his lawes, and doe thoſe <note place="margin">A perfect co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale.</note>thinges which be honourable, and agreeable to the aduiſe of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. For the lawe is moſt perfect reaſon, whereunto whoſoeuer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth, doth ſeeme a God among men. Wee wiſh likewiſe, that all Councellors ſhould be men of much vertue: for they being a meane betwixt the king and people, may the rather giue councell, by what meanes the ſtate may be ſafely gouerned. The authoritie of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors <note place="margin">The authority of Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cellors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>conſiſteth in conſulting, iudging and commaunding. The king vſeth theſe men as friendes and Councellors, imploying their vertue and aduiſe in matters of moſt difficulty, which is the cauſe that men ſay, the king hath many hands, many eyes, and many feete. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, for that it ſeemeth a thing rather diuine their humaine, that one man alone ſhould gouerne the whole ſtate, it is neceſſary to haue the aide of many others; yet referring the determination to the king alone, all things are like to proceede well. But he that doth manage all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters without Councel, truſting only to his owne iudgement, is thought rather a ſelfe-liker, then a wiſe man. As therfore the aduiſe of Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors is profitable in commonweales, where the reſolution is reſerued to the king only. So where the determination reſteth in many, the ſame becommeth vnprofitable. For as a man hauing many ſeruantes, and commaunding ſomwhat to be done, euery one runneth, &amp; yet nothing is done; but committing his buſines to one alone, findeth the ſame performed: So happeneth it in commonweales, where many haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, one truſting to another, they become careles, &amp; the affaires of the commonweale receiue preiudice. The multitude of gouernours' doth (as experience teacheth) proue vnprofitable, &amp; therfore the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe ſaith, <hi>Rex vnicus eſto.</hi> And as the head, without perill of life, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taken from the heart, ſo may not the king be remoued from his Councell, becauſe ſuch diſiunction breedeth diſcord to the common <note place="margin">The neceſſity of Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cellors</note>weale, and in the ende confuſion and deſtruction may followe thereof. In euerye commonweale a Councell is of greate neceſſitie, for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7093:13"/>
it giueth aduiſe, not onely to the king, but vnto the ſtate alſo; not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vnto the vitall parte of mans ſoule, which being in the hearte, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth life to that which is pertaker of Reaſon, &amp; is placed in the head. The king alſo through aduiſe of the Senate doth more profitably directe the commonweale, becauſe hee onely doth gouerne, although in gouernment hee vſeth to be councelled. For as reaſon doth in all proceedinges thereof, employe the ſeruice of the ſences: Yet is it that alone which determineth, and ought aboue the reſte to bee honoured. A Prince therefore contente to be councelled, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of all other men the wiſeſt, becauſe hee beareth aboute him a iudgemente perfecte and fullye furniſhed with the inſtructions and aduiſe of many. Thus doing, a Kinge ſhall well gouerne all things, not onelye through his owne opinion, which may many waies be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, but alſo by the common aduiſe and councell of others, whereby his reaſon and iudgemente is brought to perfection. Of which two thinges who ſo euer is poſſeſſed, may deſeruinglye bee thought a GOD among men. Euen as the hand deuided into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fingers, is thereby made ſtrong and apte to laye holde of all things. So he that gouerneth with the aſſiſtance of Councellors and miniſters, ſhall doe all thinges with better diſcretion and wiſedome. For one man is not fitt to performe all actions. <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> with his ſmall hande conquered greate enemies. <hi>Pyrhus</hi> excelled in chooſing places of fortification. <hi>Haniball</hi> was often victorious, yet ignorant howe to vſe the victorie. <hi>Philopemen</hi> was skilfull in the warres by ſea. <hi>Cleon</hi> coulde manure landes and poſſeſſions. <hi>Cicero</hi> was an excellente Orator, <hi>Pompeius</hi> a Captayne, <hi>Cato</hi> a Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and <hi>Scipio</hi> skilfull both in warre and peace. So were diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: for euerye man (as ſaith the prouerbe) is <hi>Roſcius</hi> in his owne <note place="margin">Orde popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris.</note>facultie. Wee will, that the popular order or meane officers of this our commonweale (who ought alſo to participate of the gouerment) ſhall be choſen amongeſt the better and moſte vertuous ſorte of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, wherein an <hi>Optimatie</hi> is reſembled, for they are as a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie of Councellors and other magiſtrates. Betwixt which two ſortes of men, this is the onelye difference, that thoſe which are placed in the ſoueraigne offices, beeing both for age and dignitie the worthier perſons, ſhall be moſt eſteemed and honoured. As for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7093:13"/>
the reſt of the people, it ſhall ſuffice, that they bee maintayned in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill life, and obedience of the Magiſtrates. For our meaning is not, that anye of the multitude, as Plowemen, Artizanes, and other perſons of vile occupation ſhall aſpyre vnto the offices, which oughte bee giuen vnto welthye Citizens, Gentlemen, and others of good education and wiſedome. Moreouer, for ſo much as, all our diſcourſe tendeth to deſcribe a perfecte commonweale, which is that wherein the people doe liue happilye: and happineſſe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of vertue, it behooueth that men beeing borne in that ſtate ſhoulde bee capable of vertue, felicitie, and honeſtie. Wee maye not therefore permitte, that any Artizan, Merchant, or bondman ſhall exerciſe the gouerment, becauſe their trade of life is vile, and voyde of <note place="margin">Merchantes, Artizans, and ſeruants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed from gouerment.</note>vertue. And albeit they are neceſſarie for the ſocietie of men, yet in reſpect they bee occupyed in actions vnfitte for free men, they are not to bee admitted to gouerne the commonweale. Which was the reaſon that mooued <hi>Conſtantinus</hi> the Emperour to determine by lawe, that none of the baſe multitude, or mechanicall people ſhoulde beare of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the ſtate, becauſe it is preſumed, that Cities were builded aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well for the habitation of wiſe and honeſt men, as perſons of neceſſitie. Yet are not ſuch men to be contemned or reputed miſerable, for it were vniuſte, and againſte the vnitie of a commonweale, to depriue them of all honour and rewarde, beeing partakers of euerye bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and alſo of ſuch condition as withoute them, the ſtate cannot bee maintayned. It is therefore neceſſarie, that they doe participate of ſuch offices as are fit for their callinges, and receiue rewardes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to their qualitie. For as the noble and wealthie ſubiectes bee honoured in their vocation, ſo theſe hauing vertuouſlye deſerued, oughte to bee aduanced. <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> his Maiſter, doe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme there are ſixe thinges wherewith euerye Citie ſhoulde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounde, <note place="margin">Six things in all ſtates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</note>and that without them it cannot bee. The firſt is victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or foode, the prouiding whereof belongeth to husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and heardemen: The ſeconde is neceſſarye handie craftes, which is performed by the Artificers: The thirde is Armes to reſiſte forraine enemies and repreſſe ciuill diſorder. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expediente to haue Soldiours prepared, and exerciſed, to the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7093:14"/>
ende that the commonweale may be defended from forraine inuaſion, and conſerued in liberty and in peace. Fourthly the ſtate hath neede of money, both for ciuill and militarie vſes. Fiftlie it requireth mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of diuine ſacramentes. Sixtlie Iudges and Councellors are neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, becauſe euerie commonweale is gouerned by good Councell, to the ende that iniuſtice, and the iniquitie of men may be extirped. By meane whereof iniurers, contemners of lawe, and all iniuſt perſons <note place="margin">The com. con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiſteth of ſixe ſortes of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>be puniſhed. Thus it appeareth, that euery commonweale conſiſteth of ſixe ſortes of men, to witt, husbandmen, Artizans, Merchantes, Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, Prieſtes, Iudges, and Councellors. Of this number wee will leaue aſide three, as men vnfitte to gouerne, which are husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Merchantes and Artizantes, beeing borne rather to ſerue, then commaunde. For to the happineſſe of euerie commonweale, the councell of wiſe and free men is required, and the ſtate needeth libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, quiete, and honeſt ayde, which wanteth in men that are occupied in <note place="margin">Two ſortes of men onely fit for the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>vncleane and illiberall artes. Two ſortes of men therefore are onelie to be imployed as gouernours, that is to ſay, Soldiours and Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors. For ſeeing that in all commonweales, two time are looked for, that is to witt, a time of peace and a time of warre. It behooueth, that thoſe onelye ſhoulde be accounted gouernours, vnto whome the care of peace and warre is committed. For in time of warre the commonweale is defended by Armes, and in time of peace the ſame is preſerued by Councell. Therefore to Soldiours and Councellors the conſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and authoritie of gouernment ought to bee committed. To the <note place="margin">The office of meane ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes.</note>inferiour officers, which wee call <hi>Popularis ordo,</hi> wee giue power to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecte the greate Magiſtrates, with other rightes belonging to publique libertie and felicitie: Yet not to all men in generall, but to euerye one in particular, according to his vertue and office. The younger ſorte ſhall be imployed in warre, becauſe they are the ſtrongeſt and of moſt force, and the elders muſte gouerne and directe, as men of more wiſedome and experience. Of ſuch diſtribution, this good will enſue, which in euerie commonweale is commendable and holie, that men of grauitie and wiſedome ſhall without iniurie to others exerciſe the ſoueraigne offices, and the yonger ſorte wanting experience, ſhall not in thoſe places inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle <note place="margin">The office of Prieſtes.</note>nor deale in the affayres of moſte weight and greateſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Amonge theſe degrees and ſundrie ſortes of men, the order of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7093:14"/>
Prieſthoode hath the precedence, becauſe the ſame is imployed in the adminiſtration of diuine ceremonies. The dignitie of that office hath alwayes beene holden moſte holie, for in <hi>AEgypte</hi> it is vnlawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for anye Kinge to gouerne, vnleſſe hee bee alſo a Prieſte. Their duetie was to ſacrifice to GOD for the peoples wellfare, and pray for thoſe thinges which were profitable, aſwell for priuate perſons as the weale publique. When <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was condemned by the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> order was taken that the religious people of eyther ſexe ſhoulde curſe him, which one of them refuſed to doe, ſaying they had entered Religion, not to make vniuſte but iuſte prayers. <hi>Plato</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ordinances of <hi>plato</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</note>in his common weale willeth, that the election of Prieſtes ſhoulde be lefte vnto GOD, to the ende that thoſe whome hee thought fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt mighte by lotte and fortune aſpyre vnto that dignitie. Hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded moreouer, that thoſe which were in election to bee choſen, ſhoulde bee examined whether they were perſons honeſte, ſounde, of good education, and borne of noble parentage, and whether they were free from murther, and all other vices, contrarye to Gods commaundementes. Hee ordayned likewiſe, that no Prieſte ſhoulde exerciſe that function longer than one yeare, nor be of leſſe age then thirtie yeares. Theſe and ſuch like ordinances of prieſthoode, <hi>Plato</hi> the wiſe Philoſopher (as it were by diuine inſpiration) hath written.</p>
            <p>For they ſeeme to haue beene gathered rather from the Lawe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> then the diſcipline of <hi>Socrates.</hi> This Phyloſopher had his edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation among the Prieſtes of <hi>Egypte,</hi> where hee learned ſuch inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as made his Philoſophie ſo perfect, that whatſoeuer proceeded from the mouth of <hi>Plato,</hi> was accounted diuine. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> excludeth this ſpirituall miniſter from the adminiſtration of ciuill polecye, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that authoritye, to the well deſeruing Citizens. Seeing then it is neſſarie that GOD ſhoulde bee ſerued, and that the Citizens of authoritie (as is aforeſaide) are of two ſortes, that is to witte, Soldiours and Councellors, it appeareth no bondeman, Artizan, Marchante or other perſon of baſe profeſſion oughte be receiued <note place="margin">Among what ſort of men Prieſtes ſhould be choſen.</note>into the miniſterie, but that euerye Prieſte ſhall bee elected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the number of Soldiours or profeſſors of learning, and that with reſpecte of age and qualitie of bodie, to the ende they maye bee fitte to exerciſe the office of that diuine callinge.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7093:15"/>
For it ſeemeth reaſonable, that thoſe who in their youth haue carefully &amp; manfully employed themſelues in the ſeruice of their commonweale, beeing become weried and vnable for action, ſhould in their age be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to liue contemplatiuelie, and die in Gods ſeruice. Among thoſe kinde of men therefore he commaundeth, that the miniſterie ſhoulde be diſtributed. Of the <hi>Athieſte,</hi> we will ſay nothing, neyther will we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Philoſophers religions, who though not ſo impiouſly, yet otherwiſe then we, do honour God. Becauſe ours is the true God, the true religion, and our miniſters farre vnlike to theirs. It hath beene alſo determined in ſchooles and Vniuerſities, that the moſt ancient and ſincere religion ſhoulde be knowen to all men. But in what ſorte the Prieſtes of our commonweale ought to be choſen, our intent is not heere to diſcourſe, neuertheleſſe let vs conſider, whether they ought to be admitted to gouerne in the ſtate or no. It ſeemeth apparantly, that the Prieſtes in moſt ancient time were made by the author all good, and firſt lawemaker <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> who beeing himſelfe before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, a Prieſt according to the lawe of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> did thereby declare he was the head and foundation of that order, &amp; that nothing was in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen more holy, nor in earth more diuine, nor in the whole worlde bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to thoſe men he gaue the knowledge and iudgement of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine lawe and ordinance. It was therefore thought expedient, profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and neceſſary, that the Princes of euerie commonweale ſhould be accompanied and councelled with ſpirituall miniſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that not without cauſe. For what is more worthy, or in gouerment more iuſte and godly, then that thoſe who be indued with wiſedome (not learned in the temple of <hi>Delphos</hi> but receiued from the heauenly ſpirite,) ſhould execute the lawes thereof iuſtlie and holily. Who ſo then doth baniſhe thoſe men from the commonweale, ſeemeth vniuſt, barbarous, vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert, and no Citizen of our Chriſtian ſtate. And i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> euerie commonweale be conſerued by the religion of God, wherein the miniſters haue moſte knowledge, thoſe ſtates ſeeme to doe moſt godly and iuſtly, that in their gouerments haue imployed ſuch councell; as the <hi>Romanes,</hi> the <hi>Egyptians</hi> the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and many other haue heeretofore done. To ſuch men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath committed the welfare and felicitie of men. Who is then ſo ſimple or ſenceleſſe, that thinketh not their councell neceſſary for the conſeruation of libertie, goods and fortune? Heetherto wee haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared which is the beſt commonweale, and what order of life the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7093:15"/>
Citizens thereof ought to embrace. A commonweale then ſo framed, accuſtomed to vertue, and plentifully furniſhed with fortunes giftes, doth ſeeme of all other thinges to be moſt noble, moſt holy, and moſt fortunate. In the deſcription whereof, leaſt we be thought to haue one ſelfe conceit with <hi>Plato,</hi> ſo as what hath bene ſaid of his commonweale, may be likewiſe affirmed of ours, (that neuer any ſuch thing is, hath bene, or can be,) it ſeemeth neceſſary to produce examples of thoſe formes of gouerment. And although our intent is not to abandon the reaſon of Philoſophers, yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer they rely ouer much to their own wiſedom, (as ſometimes they doe) eſteeming more their priuate iudgement, then the opinion of others, our meaning is not to beleeue them.

The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that ſtate which we intend to frame, ſhalbe ordinarie, reaſonable, and according to the cuſtome of men, yet accompayning the fame with Philoſophicall hiſtories.

But what authority the Senate, vnder thoſe kings had, (which order did repreſent the <hi>Optimatie)</hi> by reaſon the time is long ſince paſſed, and few writers haue therof written, cannot be to vs apparantly knowen: yet muſt we beleeue, that thoſe kinges had about them wiſe men, whoſe councell they imployed in gouerning. The kinges of that age (as <hi>Thucidides</hi> affirmeth) did rule by conſent of the people, and with their ſuffrages determined many thinges, whereof themſelues were doubtfull.

In that kingdome the lawes are of ſo great force, as euery man religiouſly ſweareth to keepe and obſerue them, and ifcontrarie to that othe any thing be done, the ſame is accounted iniuſt and impious. That othe which they ſweare for the obſeruation of their lawes and liberty is in their language cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Captue,</hi> which ſignifieth in Latine <hi>Tegmen capitis,</hi> for as the heade is kept from cold by being couered, ſo through vertue of that othe, their lawes, liberty and welfare is conſerued, becauſe in maintayning thereof, no good man feareth to aduenture his life againſt Tyrants, and all others that labour to violate the boundes of publique liberty and happineſſe. That people therefore doe liue in great liberty, beeing perſwaded that to liue according to lawe, is indeed perfect freedome. In that kingdome, the Prince gouerneth by lawes, and proceedeth not according to will. In making of warre or concluding of peace, he vſeth the aduiſe of his Councell, neuer tranſgreſſing the lawes; which worketh this effect, that among the people the kinges perſon is not onely highly honoured, but alſo for a God rightly reuerenced and adored. For who is he that would not entirely loue, honour, and reuerence that Prince, who in gouerning, is of one ſelfe minde with the lawe, contented to be led by the line of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, directing his doings, according to the expert wiſdome of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors.

Hee therefore in all commonweales is of greate neceſſitie: for without his wiſedome, councell, fidelitie, and diſcretion, no ſtate can ſtande nor be gouerned, whereof alſo the ſtate and order of euerye commonweale may be knowen. As the ſhippe in tempeſtious ſeas is endangered, and many time drowned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe by the labour and induſtrie of the mariners it be ſaued: So the commonweale tormented with tempeſt of ſeditions and diſcord, muſt periſh, if through the diligence and wiſedome of the Magiſtrates it be not preſerued.

For ſo ſhall they commaund with more reputation, and the ſubiectes more willingly obey them. Surely whoſoeuer ſhall without indignitie aſpyre to the place of ſupreme gouerment, hath neede to vſe great art and ſingular wiſedome. For ſuch a one is to gouerne, not one onely houſe, not one onely famely, not one onely wife, not one onely raſe of children, but the commonweale, deuided into infinite and contrarie humors of men, which by his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome muſt be reduced to one conſent, equality, and concord.

The kinges <note place="margin">The office of Kinges.</note>authority contayneth great vertue, high vnderſtanding, and diuine wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; for as God is prince of the vniuerſall world, ſo is the King Lord of the whole commonweale. It behooueth him therefore to gouerne iuſtlie and godlie, becauſe in the commonweale he is accounted the Lieuetenant of God. For the Councell, wiſedome, and knowledge of kinges is not their owne, but giuen them of God. Alſo, for ſomuch as, no king can with his diligence and onely wiſedome, equally gouerne the whole ſtate, (for it is rather the vertue of God then man, exactlye to know all thinges apperteyning to good gouerment) they haue therfore vſed to call vnto their aſſiſtance ſome wiſe men, whereby the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale might be the better gouerned.

The king being but one onely man, cannot looke vnto all thinges, and ſometimes it happeneth that eyther by giuing liberty to his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, or yeelding to his affections, hee is ſeduced from true reaſon: and the ignorant multitude, being (as they ſay) without head or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion, cannot be capable of that knowledge. Yet the Senate being <note place="margin">A Senate in al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweales of much ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie.</note>choſen, and made of vertuous, wiſe and expert men, may from their place (as from a watch-tower) looke about, and prouide thinges needefull for the ſtate, preuenting all ſeditions, tumultes, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils that can be attempted: which is the reſpect, there is not skantlie any commonweale, which vſeth not to commit eyther the whole, or the greateſt charge of gouernment to the Senate. For albeit they were indeede called Kings, who firſt aſſembled the habitation of men into Cities, liuing before ſauagely, diſperſed in woods and fieldes; yet with that courſe of gouernment, the kings could not alone retayne them in obedience. Neyther did the authority and wiſdome of one Prince ſuffiſe, when the mindes of men were reduced to ciuilitie, and their <note place="margin">The originall of Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors.</note>wonted beſtialitie reiected.

If any goodnes be in nobilitie, it is as <hi>Boetius</hi> thinketh, a certaine ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity impoſed vppon Gentlemen, that they ſhould not degenerate from their anceſtors. Moreouer, as the exerciſe of our qualities and actions are diuers, ſo are the degrees of Nobility proceeding of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, likewiſe diuers. The Nobility of priuate men, and all ſuch as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7093:21"/>
liue in contemplation, may be called Philoſophicall nobilitie, but the ſame in thoſe, that eyther gaine glory by counſelling the commonweale <note place="margin">Nobilitie ciuill.</note>wiſely, or that ſhew themſelues valiant in the warre of their country, is called ciuill nobility. The force of this nobilitie extendeth to all poſterity, and the memory thereof to be recorded by portratures, badges and monuments, wherewith men are incited to imitate and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the vertue of their anceſtors. For the badges of nobility doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent <note place="margin">Badges and Armes of Nobilitie.</note>nothingelſe, but the title or claime to nobilitie, and is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of ancient vertue and dignitie, wherewith we are (as by a pledge of honeſt life) bound to follow the ancient vertue and actions of our forefathers. As in euery commonweale, there is two times, the one of peace, the other of warre, ſo be the noble Citizens of two ſorts: the one for warre, the other apt for peace. The firſt of them by Armes doe inlaige, or at the leaſt defend the confines of our country, the the ſecond with counſell and wiſedome doth gouerne and preſerue it. They ought therefore be mixed, to the ende the commonweale may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the more profit. For in all things conſultable, action followeth <note place="margin">Conſultation to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before action.</note>Counſell, which was the reſpect, thoſe men whoſe counſell in time of peace, gouerned the commonweale wiſely, peaceablie and happilie, were preferred before them, that eyther defended or enlarged the ſame by armes. For as the ſoule is more worthy then the bodie, and peace more precious then warre, ſo is the one ſort of men to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other. <hi>Homer</hi> induceth <hi>Agamemnon</hi> ſaying, he coulde more eaſely ſurpriſe <hi>Troy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

But who excelleth both in wiſedome and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall knowledge, is deſeruingly aboue all others to be eſteemed and honoured. For who ſo poſſeſſeth moſt vertue is to be reputed moſt worthie and honourable. We will therefore that our Councellor ſhall not onely be a good Citizen, but alſo a good man. For the vertue of <note place="margin">The vertue of a good Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, and the vertue of a good man, is diuers</note>a good man differeth from the vertue of a good Citizen, in that the one vſeth all vertues agreeable to honeſt life, the other obſerueth onely the lawes made for preſeruation of ciuill commoditie. And as ſometimes we ſee a cunning Artizan an euill man, ſo a good Citizen in ſeruice of the ſtate, may be politique, diligent, and ſtout, yet otherwiſe iniuſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate, and cowardly. It is ſaide that <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> was ſuch a one,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7093:22"/>
becauſe his manner of life was not vnfit for a good man, yet ſuch as did differ from the qualitie of a good Citizen. But we will that our Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſhall be ſuch a man as hath beene deſcribed.</p>

               <note place="margin">The felicitie of common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales and men, as one thing.</note> Thoſe commonweales haue euer beene accounted fortunate and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, wherein the ſubiectes be alſo bleſſed. For euerie Citie is ſuch as are the manners of the Citizens. The felicitie of men and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales doth ſeeme to ſpring from one fountaine, from one ſelfe cauſe, and through vertue they doe become both happy.

For that ſtate onely is happy, which is good. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth therfore, that therein be the goods of minde, the goods of bodie, and riches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The goods of minde are gained by vertue, by ayde wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">By what meane the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>weale is made wiſe.</note>onely, the Citie is wiſe, ſtrong, temperate and iuſt. That ſtate is wiſe, which is indued with wiſe and good Counſell, vnderſtanding what belongeth to knowledge and learning: which wiſedome or knowledge, cannot be in bace people and men mechanicall, but in ciuill perſons deſtined to honour and vertue: as Princes, Councellors, Iudges, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals and gouernours: in reſpect of whome the ſtate is called wiſe. For if thoſe ſortes of men be fooliſh, vnexpert and vnlearned, the ſame <note place="margin">By what meane the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>weale is valient.</note>doth cauſe the whole commonweale to be vaine and ſimple. The valor of the ſtate conſiſteth in Captaines and Soldiers, whoſe induſtrie, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and expertnes in cauſes militarie, doth make the commonweale valiant. Such men be formidable to foes, and defende the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale from dangers, whereby it becommeth aſſured and quiet. It great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie behoueth euery ſtate to haue expert and well trained ſoldiers, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſame continueth quiet from terrors and tumults. It is therefore neceſſary, that in time of peace the vſe of Armes be not diſcontinued, and that ſoldiers be exerciſed for vertue and not for violence. For to employ Armes againſt friendes, or the commonweale, ſeemeth not onely the part of a bad ſoldier, but alſo of an euill man. Wherefore <note place="margin">The office of Soldiers.</note>the chiefe vertue of a ſoldier ought be, to ſhew himſelfe towards thoſe of his owne country, modeſt, courteous and mercifull, and towardes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, fierce, couragious, and cruell. For while furie of warre raigneth, and enemies doe aſſault ſubiectes, into their handes, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon welfare, religion, fidelitie and liberty of the commonweale is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: becauſe they onely doe ſupport the liues and goods of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubiectes. Euery ſoldier then that deſerueth to be called a defender
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7093:22"/>
of his country, doth know, his delight ought not to be in pleaſure, idlenes, or domeſticall delicacie, but Armes, weapons, lances, labour and ſweat. A ſoldier ought alſo to auoyde, priuate quarrell and fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious enterpriſes; neyther ſhall he entermeddle with ciuill conſpiracy or rebellion, but at all times be carefull to withſtand the perils attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt his country. Doeſt thou delight to hunt the Bucke, the Boare, the Beare and Hare? or take pleaſure to teach thy Dogs to kill them? why ſhouldeſt thou not likewiſe ſtudie to aſſault Caſtles, leade ſoldiers, and vanquiſh thine enemy? If in theſe things thou be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and care onely to fill thine owne paunch, then thou makeſt warre with ſauage beaſtes onely, and lieſt in waite for thy neighbours goods or life, whereby certainly thou liueſt a ſeditious, ignoble and idle life, not worthy to be called a ſoldier, but a ſluggard; not a Gentleman, but a Iugler; and therefore as a ſlaue, vnworthy thy dignitie we doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute thee. Is the warre proclaimed? then muſt thou without delaie be readie, leaſt in long thinking what pay is prepared for thee, thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie hath fraught himſelfe with ſpoyles, and is eſcaped, wherby thy country ſhall afterwardes too late lamente thy ſlooth. It is therefore more profitable ſpedely to take armes, then with long muſing to marre all. Buthappely no wages is giuen, what then? wilt thou rather ſell thy ſeruice, or giue it to thy country; which hath giuen thee life, honour, riches, with all other things, in hope of this onely duetie, that thou ſhouldeſt hold it moſt deere, and as a faithfull and voluntary ſoldier freely defend it. God forbid thou ſhouldeſt thinke, that thy vertue were to be made Noble with money, or that thou would be called rather a couetous ſoldier, then a true ſeruant to thy country. Be perſwaded that the duetie of a ſoldier is, to know howe to handle Armes and be fit for the warre, to liue iuſtly and equally with other ſubiectes, not offending their quiet or reputation. For if thou fight for peace, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing peace, why doeſt thou make warre at home? Certainely it ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the commonweale vpon, to prouide by lawe, that ſoldiers may be compelled to honeſt life, and feared from offending others: For there is nothing more terrible, then iniurie armed. The boldnes of ſoldiers not bridled by lawe, doth paſſe on ſo farre forward, as may eyther ſubuert the ſtate, or inforce the good and modeſt ſubiectes, yea iuſtice it ſelfe to obey Armes; which we read heeretofore happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among the <hi>Romaines,</hi> where the ſoldiers for diuers yeares hauing

To the perfection of man three things (as the Philoſopher affirmeth) are required, that is to ſay, Nature, Cuſtome, and Reaſon. As touching Nature: to be thereby good and happy, it reſteth not in our power, but in the gift of God. For whomſoeuer he bleſſeth, is by the inſtinct of Nature good, wiſe, and of perfect iudgement. It many times alſo happeneth, that as one man beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth an other, &amp; one beaſt an other, ſo of wiſe and good anceſtors, wiſe &amp; good poſterity doth deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, which nature alwaies indeuoreth to bring to paſſe, but not therin preuailing, appeareth how corruptible our nature is, either through education, or (to ſpeake in Chriſtian wiſe) through the ſin of our forefathers, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bad Angel diuerted &amp; corrupted.

Whereunto may be anſwered. There are two ſortes of Philoſophers, whome I thinke in deede vnfitt to gouerne the commonweale. The firſt are they who haue ſcantlie taſted of Philoſophie, whereby the thirſting heate of vices and deſires, is not with vertue quenched: So as, thoſe men doe leade a life di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers from the groundes of true Philoſophie not yet well rooted in them. For the knowledge thereof doth make men no leſſe good then learned, and by knowledge they become learned, and through Iuſtice, Temperance, and Fortitude, they are made perfect. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is not any thing in Philoſophie more notable, then the iuſtitutions and preceptes of vertue, whereof who ſo hath the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, doth leade a happie and bleſſed life. An other ſorte of Philoſophers there is contrarie to theſe, who hauing in their youth learned Philoſophie, doe (as it were) vnto the <hi>Syrene</hi> rockes cleaue thereunto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euen the whole courſe of their liues. Such kinde of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7093:24"/>
and Philoſophie which concerneth not the profitt, nor ciuill affayres of men, is in trueth improfitable for the ſtate. For albeit thoſe Philoſophers be learned and wiſe, yet onely applying their thoughtes to Philoſophie, not hauing experience of courte or ciuill affayres, are vtterly vnfitt for gouernment. Therefore <hi>Plato</hi> commaundeth that thoſe ſolitarie worſhippers of wiſedome, being by nature apt for action in the commonweale, ſhoulde be founde out, and compelled thereunto, thinkng them fit to gouerne Cities, and appeaſe the ſedition of people. And touching the reſt, which are not apt for that purpoſe, he ſuffereth them to enioy their reſt, and were out their life in contemplation. Wherefore neyther they that be lightly learned, nor thoſe that are become ouermuch in bondage to Philoſophie, ought be admitted to gouerne the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale, becauſe the one haue not by Philoſophie attained anie ende of honeſt life whereunto to leane, and the other, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded they haue a life much better then ciuill, doe paſſe their age ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie (as they thinke) among rockes of the fortunate Ilandes. For there is not any life (as <hi>Plato</hi> writeth) which hath ciuill magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in more contempt, then that which is exerciſed in true Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie. The meane ſort of Philoſophers are therefore (in our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <note place="margin">What Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers are fit for gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>moſt fitt for gouernment: becauſe they doe not by the ſtudie of Philoſophie ſearch deeper then the knowledge whereby men may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to happie life, and become fit to gouerne the commonweale. To which kinde of Philoſophie we exhorte our Counſellor. For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not onely the knowledge of humaine happines, but alſo the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of gouerment is attained. Firſt we will that his nature be apt for philoſophie; that is, temperate, docible, and iuſt: becauſe there is no man that can well exerciſe himſelfe therein, if naturally he be not of good memorie, docible, couragious, a and louer of trueth, iuſtice and temperancie, which diſpoſition being bred onely by good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, it is neceſſary that from his childhoode he be ſo trained. The <note place="margin">Good educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the roote of wiſedome.</note>ground of all wiſedome, <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, is good education, for thereby as it were in ſporte, we profit in all kindes of vertue. Men muſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from their tender yeares be inſtructed to reioyce or be ſorie for thoſe things, which ought iuſtlie to glad them, or ſad them. It is therfore a vertue to know how to reioyce, or to be ſory, for ſuch knowledge, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> thinketh, is true educatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And as it behoueth a perfect co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale

to haue good ſubiectes whereby it may alſo become good, ſo ought <note place="margin">The Com. muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the education of youth.</note>there be great diligence in their education. For as a good husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man diligently proyneth his plants, to make them grow the faſter: So the commonweale which is the mother &amp; houſe-wife of ſubiects, ought <note place="margin">The Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note>to be exceeding carefull for the education and vertuous inſtruction of young people. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were wont for the education of their Citizens, to elect Magiſtrates among the number of their moſt ancient and graue Citizens, and them they called publique Tutors, for which reſpect, they were holden vertuous men in action, valiant and excellent in military diſcipline. It is written that <hi>Diogenes</hi> returning from <hi>Sparta</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> was by the way asked from whence he came and whither he went: Whereunto he anſwered, he came from men, and was going to women, noting thereby the effeminacie of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who were for that vice, by the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and the other <hi>Grecians</hi> mocked to ſcorne. Vpon which occaſion, <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> then King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> hearing an <hi>Athenian</hi> boaſting the thicknes of <hi>Athens</hi> walles, ſaide, that the ſame did well become them, becauſe high walles were wont to be built for women. But let vs returne to education, whereof in theſe daies to ſmall care is taken: for children, are neyther by their fathers taught a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny liberall or honeſt ſcience, nor committed to the tuition of any skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <note place="margin">The Romane education.</note>inſtructers. I cannot therefore but commend the diligence of <hi>Cato</hi> in the nurture of his ſonne, for he diſdained not to be preſent, and looke vpon his wife, at ſuch time as ſhe waſhed and ſwathed his young children, and ſo ſoone as yeares had abled them for learning, he tooke them into his owne tuition, and taught them. At that time he kept <hi>Chylo</hi> the Grammarian in his houſe to inſtruct children, who was in deed learned, yet thought he not fitt that <hi>Chylo</hi> being a ſeruant ſhould cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his ſonne, and when he erred pull him by the eares, alſo he diſday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be beholding to a ſcholemaſter for the education of his ſonne. Hee therefore himſelfe did teach his ſonne learning, lawes and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and likewiſe inſtructed him howe to darte, to handle weapons, ride, ſwime, and ſuffer heate and colde. It is ſaide moreouer, that with his owne hande he wrote an Hiſtorie, and gaue it to his ſonne, to the ende he might therein ſee the Actes of his anceſtors, and learne the skill howe to gouerne the commonweale. In his ſonnes preſence he neuer vttered any vncleane, foule, or angrie ſpeach, but vſed ſo great reſpect, as if the <hi>veſtall</hi> virgins, or Prieſts had looked on him. Such was the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7093:25"/>
domeſticall diſcipline of <hi>Cato,</hi> and the moſt of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> in educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">The educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Graecia</note>of their children. The Philoſophers in <hi>Graecia</hi> made plaies for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of young men: which diſcipline, eternall memory hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued till theſe ourdaies. From them is alſo come the vnderſtanding of vertue and knowledge, which we haue taken by tradition. Thoſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers were not onely Tutors of good and happy life, but alſo tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of ciuill gouerment. Yea this preſent age, hath (according to the <hi>Graecian</hi> cuſtome) vniuerſities, which are as Seminaries of learning and vertue. Thither young men (as vnto a harueſt of good ſcience,) may daily reſort, and gather the fruites of good diſcipline and vertue. Would God the Maſters of thoſe ſchooles, wolde frame the wittes of young men there, rather to liue well, then diſpute well: for happilie, ſo ſhould they both of the commonweale and life of men deſerue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and their ſchollers not deſire (as they ſay) rather to heare a leſter then a Philoſopher. In ancient time Philoſophers taught their pupils firſt to be ſilent, but now their chiefe inſtruction is to ſpeake a pace, which breedeth ſo many pratling Orators and witleſſe Philoſophers: For they ſtudie not to fill their breaſtes with vertues and honeſt diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, but teach their tongues plentie of wordes: So as, we ſee them commended of their teachers, for wrangling &amp; ſtrength of witt in argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not for modeſty, wiſedome, and iuſtice. But all learned men <note place="margin">The office of learned men.</note>ought know, that they ſhould not keepe ſchooles for ſuch drouſie and ſlouthfull Philoſophy, but teach ciuill knowledge, the commendation whereof conſiſteth in well doing and thinking truely. The ancient <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies</hi> of <hi>Graecia</hi> were the nurſeries of all commonweales, &amp; out of them (as from the <hi>Troian</hi> horſe) came forth moſt excellent kings, ſingular Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and gouernors. <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> (two moſt noble Chieftains) were brought vp in ſchooles. I omit many others. Thus it appeareth, that men ought to be trained in ſchooles, and there to learne honeſt life &amp; the ſkill of gouerment. Alſo euery ſtate ſhould be carefull to haue ſchooles, as ſhops filled with all ſorts of vertue. In ſuch a one therfore as ſhall become a Counſellor, we wiſh good nature, &amp; education. For that being euill, is not only to be bettred by Philoſophy, but beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth much the worſe: for mans nature is moſt prone to euil, &amp; being ſtrengthned &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed with ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; Philoſophy, gaineth therby more force &amp; ſkil to do euill: ſith the beſt knowledges poſſeſſed by a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of peruerſe nature, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued, &amp; cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged into a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherof euill cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel procedeth.

The cogitations of an angrie minde in an euill man, doe increaſe fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: which is the cauſe, that a ſubtill ſpirit moued to coller, is conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into madnes. It may then be concluded, that a good nature euill inſtructed, becommeth worſt of all, and euill nature well inſtructed, is alſo oftentimes abuſed and imployed in wicked actions. For euerie good euill vſed, becommeth worſe then euill it ſelfe: not vnlike to good ſeedes ſowed in euill ſoyle, which do for the moſt part change their nature. Great is the force of education, which changeth, and rechan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the tender mind of youth, aſwell to good as euill. <hi>Diogenes</hi> being asked, how man might lead a quiet life, anſwered. Firſt he muſt honour the Gods, who are the makers of all felicitie: Secondly, he muſt bring vp his children in vertue, for being euill inſtructed, they become the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt enemies to their aged fathers: Thirdly, he muſt be thankefull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes his friends. The ſaying of <hi>Apollo</hi> is true, that the vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <note place="margin">Education of children.</note>man is moſt hurtfull, and odious to the whole world, Moreouer, it behoueth for the better inſtitution of children, that they be inſtructed in the propertie of ſpeach, eloquence, and knowledge of the trueth, whereunto he attaineth by the ſciences of Grammer, Rhetorike, and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gike. For theſe knowledges, are as it were gates and entries of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. From them he may receiue the rules of ſpeaking, which are confirmed by vſe, domeſticall exerciſe, and the reading of antient Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets and Orators. For being inſtructed in theſe, he will leaue the cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of common and knowen things, and call vnto his conſideration matters of more importance. Becauſe the minde beginning to know it ſelfe, doth then ſeeke for true foode, wherof to feede and be ſatiſfied. The true foode and medicine of the mind is Philoſophie, becauſe it hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all ſortes of ſicknes and ſorrowes therein, making a perfect path vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to happines; and by vertue therof, our mindes are ſtirred to more worthy cogitations. The reaſon therof is, that the mind abandoneth the bodie and all terreſtrial thoughts, and ſtudieth vpon things high and coeleſtial. <note place="margin">Philoſophy of two kindes.</note>This knowledge of Philoſophy is of two ſortes, the one conſiſteth in the ſubtiltie of nature &amp; is ſubiect to the vniuerſall contemplation of the whole world: the other ſheweth the true inſtitution of mans life, &amp; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, how commonweals ſhould be gouerned, and priuate houſholdes maintained. To the firſt appertaineth theſe parts of Philoſophy, called <hi>Phyſica, Metaphyſica,</hi> and <hi>Methematica,</hi> &amp; to the other; <hi>Ethica, Politica,</hi> and <hi>Oeconomica.</hi> The end of both thoſe knowledges is not diuers. For as by the

contemplation of things diuine, the mind diſioyned from the body, by it ſelfe is made bleſſed &amp; like vnto God. So doth it come to paſſe in honeſt actions, that reaſon being garded by vertue, doth withhold the minde from the vncleane actions of the corrupt body. The minde by theſe two meanes diſſeuered from the body, becommeth like vnto God, and may iuſtly be accounted happy &amp; bleſſed. In this onely, thoſe two knowledges doe differ: that the one by action, the other by contemplation repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ſimilitude of God. Wherof a double felicity followeth, the one <note place="margin">Two kindes of felicity.</note>priuate, the other publique.

It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo more then neceſſary, that our Senator be perfect in all ordinances, concerning warre, peace, prouiſions, the qualitie of ſubiectes, the adminiſtration of the ſtate, and natures of men, knowing alſo thoſe things, wherwith their mindes be exalted or deiected, what vertue is, what ought be the diſcipline of youth, what the education of ſubiectes, what cuſtomes ſhould be confirmed, what honour belongeth to God and religion. Beſides thoſe, let him not be vtterly ignorant, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractes, leagues, and aliences with other Princes and Potentates. For we ſee all theſe things laid before the eyes of men, and daily vſed in their proceedings and in Court. And it were very vnſeemely, that a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor ſhould be a ſtranger in cuſtomes of ſtate, in examples, in lawes, and the diſpoſition of that people he gouerneth, It ſeemeth therfore that <hi>Antonius</hi> hath well deſcribed a Gouernour or Councellor ſaying, he ſhould be ſuch a man as vnderſtandeth, by what meanes the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale is pro fited or enlarged, and at occaſions to vſe them. For (ſaith he) ſuch were in <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>Lentuli, Gracchi, Metelli, Scipioni</hi> and <hi>Lelii.</hi> In this our age, there are many, that aſpyre to offices of ſtate, without

ſufficiencie, without knowledge, and without wiſedome. And if any man ſeemeth ſufficient for Counſell, the cauſe thereof is, eyther one yeares experience in warre, practiſe in the lawe, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or domeſticall authoritie: but in all good and honeſt ſciences, and and in the knowledge of vertue, they are vtterly ignorant. And in mine opinion, no Counſellor deſerueth true commendation, who knoweth not, or wanteth will to thinke well, and doe iuſtly. For it were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely, that he ſhoulde ſweare others to the execution of lawe, vnleſſe himſelfe be a man for high Wiſedome and Counſell moſt perfect: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ought be iuſt, indifferent, and praiſe worthy: which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from vertue, lawe, and perfect reaſon. All wiſedome doth aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly come from the knowledge of thinges, which vnleſſe man attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto by experience in great matters &amp; learning, he ſhall neuer think, ſpeake, or doe any thing worthy a Counſellor or wiſe man. A greate part alſo of wiſedome required in a Counſellor, conſiſteth in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note place="margin">Trauell in forraine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note>of manners, lawes and cuſtomes of diuers nations, which is beſt attained vnto by forraine trauell, as <hi>Homer</hi> writeth of <hi>Vliſſes.</hi>

Such things therfore as are honeſt, agreable with the nature of our country people, profitable for the ſtate, or not contrary to the earth and ayre where we liue, may be receiued from forraine Nations: for ſuch fruites of trauell, and no other ought be commended. Many moſt notable men haue taken pleaſure in trauell: as <hi>Nestor, Menelaus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> the great.

We thinke alſo very conuenient, that he haue ſome taſte of naturall Philoſophy, but to conſume much labour in that ſtudy, we account ſuperfluous. For among the manifold actions of mans life, it is lawfull to be ignorant in ſomwhat. The field of knowledge is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable and infinite, which was the cauſe that men applied themſelues <note place="margin">Things to be knowen of three ſortes.</note>to particular ſtudies, as impoſſible for one man to excell in all. And for ſo much as things to be knowen, are of three ſortes: that is to ſay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, pleaſant, and honeſt; the knowledge of things pleaſant and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, is not for gouernment of the ſtate ſo neceſſary, as to him that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, ſweete and contenting. Yet is ſuch ſcience very fit to recreate the minde of him that is wearied with hearing, thinking, &amp; conſulting of cauſes concerning the commonweale. At which times, knowing how to entertaine himſelfe, it will greatly content him. This kind of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie therefore is very profitable in the commonweale, chiefly if thoſe that be therein learned, doe leade a ciuill life, being conuerſant with other Citizens, and not lurking within their priuate houſes or ſolitarie places. Neuertheleſſe if eyther for lacke of health, or other impediment they be knowen vnfit for the gouernment, then doe we permit them to liue according to their owne nature, powring oyle vppon their heads &amp; crowning them with wooll, &amp; diſmiſſe them to their ſtudies, ſchooles, <note place="margin">In what ſorte priuate Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers be profitable.</note>and caues of contemplation. This kinde of Philoſophie although it be priuate, yet may it greatly profitt the commonweale. For they are not onelye to bee allowed whoſe knowledge doth gouerne the ſtate, but thoſe alſo that in writinge doe leaue eternall
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7093:28"/>
Monumentes of their wiſedome, or that by their precepts doe inſtruct others in vertue and the knowledge of gouernment. For out of their bookes we gather many thinges touching the lawes, cuſtomes, and felicity of the commonweale, ſo that their ſtudious quiet, ſeemeth greatly to aide our action. Such kinde of men were <hi>Theophrastus, Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clides Ponticus, Dicaearchus, Socrates</hi> and <hi>Pithagoras.</hi> The ſchollers of <hi>Dicaearchus</hi> wrote a booke of the commonweale, requiring, the ſame might euery yeare be publiquely reade in <hi>Sparta,</hi> and commaunded that all the youth of that Citie ſhoulde be at the reading preſent. The preceptes of Philoſophie are to bring vertue and knowledge into the mindes of men, and not to maintaine diſputation and contentions. For in my iudgement, all ſtrife, wrangling, anger, and euill ſpeach, are things vnworthy of Philoſophie, and I holde him vnwiſe that thinketh Philoſophie to conſiſt in wordes. For conſtancie, felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <note place="margin">VVhich is the true Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</note>and honeſtie, are in deede the true Philoſophie, becauſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſciences are not vertues, but the inſtrumentes and ornamentes of vertue. Neyther doe I thinke it good, that the mindes of men ſhoulde be drawen into fectes. Wherefore firſt we will vtterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpe all <hi>Epicuriſme</hi> out of our mindes, becauſe that knowledge ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of ſenſuall pleaſure, ought not to be in him, whome we ſeeke and deſire ſhoulde be a Cheiftiane in publique Counſell and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. With the <hi>Stoickes</hi> I finde no faulte, yet doe I thinke them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be diſmiſſed, as vnfit for the companie of our Counſellor. Becauſe (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) they affirme onely Philoſophers to be wiſe, and all others to be theeues, enemies, barbarous and madde men. Neyther will they conſent, that there is any wiſe man liuing. It were therefore abſurde, to admit him a Counſellor, that thinketh no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor to be wiſe, a Citizen, or a Free-man. Betwixt the ſectes of <hi>Stoickes</hi> and <hi>Peripatetickes</hi> touching this <hi>ſummum bonum</hi> diſcention hath euer beene, but our intente is, to concurre with the <hi>Peripatetickes:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the more true Tutors of manners and vertue, and out of that famelie, perfect Citizens, Emperours, Kinges, and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers (as out out of the <hi>Troian</hi> horſe) haue iſſued. Theſe moſt <note place="margin">Eloquence.</note>noble ſciences and artes in a Senator, ſhall be greatlie beautified and graced by eloquence, which is is the true ornament of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

made good and of honeſt conuerſation. For men are not onely to learne the skill of commaunding, but alſo the order of obeying, and that they ought aſwell to honour and loue the Magiſtrates, as performe their commaundements. Which thing proceeding from the due exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of lawe, the Counſellor muſt in that poynt endeuour himſelfe to become a skilfull aud learned lawier. The firſt degree to the attaining of vertue and honeſty, is to obey the lawes and Magiſtrates. For <note place="margin">What law is.</note>the lawe of euery ſtate, is nothing elſe but vertue and good order of life, reduced into rules certaine. <hi>Theopompus</hi> king of <hi>Sparta</hi> being told that the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> commonweale flouriſhed becauſe the kinges thereof were skilfull in gouerning, anſwered, no.

               <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> diſciplines, the chiefe was (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth) to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the lawes and magiſtrates, to indure all trauell patiently, and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to fight manfully, and die willingly. The like diſcipline was obſerued in all other places of <hi>Graecia,</hi> and therein the youth were exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed: to the ende that through ſuch inſtruction, they might learne, in time of warre to defend their country, in time of peace to gouerne, and ſuch as liued in priuate life, to imploy their leyſure honeſtlie, that is to wit, in learning, well gracing their ieſture, muſicke, painting and ſwimming: deriding all thoſe that were ignorant both, in good letters and the skill of ſwimming. A certaine Ciiizen of <hi>Thebes</hi> being asked how the ſtate of euery commonweale might be preſerued? anſwered, by the obſeruation of iuſtice, and chiefly where is diſcipline among young men, and no couetouſnes among olde men. Great aſſuredly is the force of ciuill diſcipline in euery commonweale, for through it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie ſubiect is made apt for all kinde of vertue. Yet is it a thing nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſome men with little or no ſtudie, vtterly voyde of arte, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing learned, and ſuch as neuer taſted of Philoſophie, nor ſcarſly euer heard thereof, doe neuertheleſſe ſeeme wiſe, good, iuſt and valiant, bearing office &amp; gouerning ciuill affaires with great reputation. Which ſo being, may happily moue ſome men to require an other kinde of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie, reiecting that we haue ſpoken of, ſuppoſing thoſe preceptes vnfit for their yeares and capacities, alledging the ſaying of Phiſitions, that, <hi>Art</hi> is long, but mans life ſhort. And <hi>Plato</hi> alſo, that he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called happy: vnto whome in age, or rather in the declination of life, knowledge and true opinion of all things is granted.

wiſedome is hardlie gotten, and (that which is moſt to be lamented) the frailtie of mans life doth cauſe many impedimentes, which hinder the attaining thereof. Many there are, whome fatall death in the middeſt of their life, or rather ſooner, haue taken away. Some alſo more willing to follow the delightes of bodie, then the vertue of minde, doe (as it were from <hi>Scilla</hi> and <hi>Caribdis)</hi> flee from knowledge, as a hard and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable life. What ſhould I ſay of thoſe that in diſpite of <hi>Minerua,</hi> are not content to doe or thinke any thing worthy Philoſophie? All which reaſons, albeit they do in ſome ſort cut of our hope, to attaine Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie and perfect wiſedome, yet ought they not vtterly diſcourage and make vs deſperate: For the length of mans life is not to be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by number of daies, but by vertue, which wanting, although thou ſuruiue the yeares of <hi>Nestor,</hi> or the <hi>Phoenix</hi> age, thy life ſhall be ſhort, miſerable, and vnhappy. What harme is it for thee to die young, if after this death, vertue doth giue thee an other being? <hi>Silenus</hi> the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et taken by theeues, and brought before King <hi>Midas,</hi> wanting money wherewith to redeeme himſelfe, deſired the king to grant him libertie; offering in recompence therof, to giue him a thing for his Maieſty more precious then any ſiluer or golde, which gift, pleaſantly and truely, he <note place="margin">Mans life mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable.</note>deſcribed in theſe wordes, ſaying. <hi>The greatest good that God can giue man, is not to be borne, the next is, to die ſoone.</hi> Which after he had by diuers reaſons proued, the king did not onely deliuer him, but alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde him. Who is he that deſireth more this frayle, miſerable, and incertaine life, then the other bleſſed happie and eternall? the poſſeſſion wherof is gained by the exerciſe of true vertue? we liue to die, why ſhould we not rather die to liue? vertue hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee happy life, thou ſhalt then die happie. Therfore our whole endeuor &amp; ſtudie ought be, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain vnto vertue; wherof Philoſophy is the nurſe &amp; Tutreſſe, for therby we ſhall either aſpire hieſt, or at the leaſt, behold many vnder vs. It ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that albeit we are inferior to the firſt, yet we are equall to the ſecond or third, ſo ſhall we be chiefe of thoſe that come after vs. Among things excellent, thoſe which be next the beſt are accounted great, for he that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Many (as is aforeſaid) haue gained the poſſeſſion of wiſedome and skill of gouerment, not by reading the bookes of Philoſophy, but by the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7093:30"/>
obſeruation of their anceſtors, example, cuſtome, experience, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall diſcipline, lawe, manners, and a certaine ſagacitie of nature, being ſomewhat graced with honeſt and liberall education. Of ſuch men, in all commonweales many examples haue euer beene. The Court is their learning; and vſe, lawe, ordinances, which the cuſtomes of their forefathers haue taught them. <hi>Demades,</hi> a man very wiſe and well practiſed in ſtate, being asked what Tutor he had to inſtruct him wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, anſwered: The Tribunall of the <hi>Athenians;</hi> thinking the Court and experience of things to excell all the precepts of Philoſophie. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the ancient <hi>Romanes</hi> frame their iuſt and honeſt forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment, ſo much according to the bookes of Philoſophers, as their own naturall wits. What ſhould I ſay of our anceſtors? who deuiſed a commonweale, not vnlike to the <hi>Romane</hi> ſtate. The diſcipline of <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, Licurgus, Solon, Ariſtotle,</hi> and other moſt notable Philoſophers, and law-makers, doe differ from the <hi>Polonians,</hi> whoſe greatnes grew on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the vertue they receiued from themſelues, and not from bookes. Their wiſedome was to honour vertue; and contrary to it, neyther to doe, or thinke any thing. Therefore they vſed not their Kings and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, to compound controuerſies, ſuppreſſe contentions, or pronounce iudgements, but to receiue from them examples and rules of vertue, and as cheiftaines in warre follow them in defence of their countrie. <note place="margin">The golden worlde.</note>That olde worlde (which the Poets called Golden) produced a race of men, of themſelues moſt happy and wiſe: and truely not vnlike, for in that time of mans firſt age, (vertue onely raigning) the miſery of vices and wickednes was not knowen, for they loued an vpright, iuſt and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple life, wherunto vertue and reaſon conſenteth. They were therfore inforced to vertue and honeſty, euen by the ſpurre of their owne nature, fleing vice, which becauſe it was to them vnknowen, might more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be eſchewed.

neſſe, as deſirous rather to knowe vice then vertue, delighting in the one and ſhunning the other. Then euery man armed himſelfe againſt vertue, thinking it was lawfull to offend others, to liue vngodly, abuſing reaſon, and employing it in euill exerciſes, as the ſame Poet ſaith.

            <p>And ſurely that floode and rage of wickedneſſe, had vtterly drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all mankind, had not the force of nature and reaſon which remained in a few; oppoſed it ſelfe againſt the fury of ſo great calamities. Thoſe fewe then (as it were proclaminge warre with vice) perſwaded other men, <note place="margin">Who thoſe were that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den world.</note>(who then liued as bruite beaſts) to reduce themſelues to humanity, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them not onely by wordes, but alſo by writing, what was ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, vertue, and honour, whereof grew lawes in Cities as a tutreſſe to good life. So as men might there learne to thinke and doe thoſe things which were honeſt, iuſt and godly: and to the ende thoſe lawes might neuer periſh, they cauſed them to be written in bookes which are records of immortality, and preſeruers of eternall memory. From hence the precepts of vertue did take their beginning, and many volumes of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and dueties of men haue bene written. After them followed others, who aſpyred not onely to knowledge of the offices and dueties belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to men, but alſo ſerched the nature of all things. This conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of humaine nature and world vniuerſall, was in one worde by the <hi>Graecians</hi> called <hi>Sophia,</hi> and the inuentors thereof were named <hi>Sophi:</hi> who afterwardes more modeſtlie (by example of <hi>Pithagoras)</hi> called themſelues Philoſophers. By this meane, the light of reaſon, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine nature which lay hidden, and was made darke with cloudes of vice, did recouer his vertue, and brought vnto vs the knowledge both of diuine and humaine thinges. Which knowledge is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Philoſophie: by the benefit whereof, mortall men recouered the ancient vertue, ſimplicitie, innocency and happines. Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in thoſe daies deſired to liue honeſtlie and well, flee vice, and knowe vertue: applied himſelfe to reade the Philoſophers bookes and marke their ſayings, as men that vtterly miſtruſted their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and witt infected with knowledge of vice, euill education,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7093:31"/>
ſlouth, delicacie, Idlenes, opiniatry, and wicked conditions. Thus was that golden world by Philoſophers reſtored, and the olde eſtate, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and felicity, was recouered. Therefore, whoſoeuer doth receiue from thence the precepts of vertue, honeſt life, and that ancient and gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den humanity, is made not onely ciuill and wiſe, but alſo happy and <note place="margin">VVho is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie wiſe.</note>moſt bleſſed. All thoſe that without Philoſophy and learning are indeed wiſe, doe attaine to their wiſedome by one of theſe two waies. The one, by being indued with diuine nature, the vertue whereof comprehendeth, foreſeeth, and vnderſtandeth all things. In olde time, amongeſt the <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, Theſeus</hi> and <hi>Cecrops:</hi> and among the <hi>Latines, Romulus</hi> and <hi>Numa</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned commonweales, not with Philoſophy, but were inſtructed by the celeſtiall Muſes. The ſecond meane to gouerne without learning is, to be perfect in forraine experience, and a vigilant obſeruer of ciuil cautions. Such men if they be good, and permit all things to be direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by lawe, are praiſeable, albeit their wiſedome is imperfect, and ſubiect to many perils and mutations: but if they be euill, then are they ſo pernicious and hurtfull to the commonweale, as nothing can be more. Therefore <hi>Mitie</hi> ſaid well, that there was nothing more vniuſt then ignorant man; for he not knowing the true rules of gouerment, thinking that the experience of one court is the whole ſumme of ciuill diſcipline, doth fill the ſtate full of tumultes and ſeditions, not concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by what meanes, reaſon, cunning or counſell, ſuch miſchiefe is happened: and ſo being, wanteth-both wiſedome and iudgement. Of which two things, ignorance the mother of vice and all euill, hath bereft him. Sith then by the benefit of nature onely, we cannot be made happy and wiſe, our mindes being ouercharged with burthen of body, indued with the knowledge of things euill, and that we liue in ſuch an age, as doth not (as in olde time) bring forth plenty of good men: It beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to deuiſe good meanes, whereby the minde may ſhake of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers and vices of body, ſo as cleared from the rage of time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, we may be reuoked to the ancient diuine and perfect life of men: which thing may be done, by the helpe of art and exerciſe, the one is attained by labour, the other gotten by Philoſophy. For the name of <note place="margin">Philoſophy.</note>Philoſophy includeth all things humaine &amp; diuine, the knowledge of all artes, all vertues, all gouernment of ſtate, and euery other thing which is eyther in heauen or in earth contained. This is that, which deliuereth the minde impriſoned in the body, from all affections, &amp; teacheth it coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7093:31"/>
to liue well, commaund, and gouerne. Our Counſellor then inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the precepts of Philoſophie, ſhall not from thence forth be ſhut vp, lurke vnſeene, be ſolitarie, walke vnaccompanied, auoyde the ſight of men, nor couer his ſlouth with keeping himſelfe within doores: but ſhall conuerſe with the multitude and Citizens, and with his preſence ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and aide the ſocietie of men. For no vertue, wit, or wiſedome, can <note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor muſt not be ſolitarie.</note>be famous, being ſhut vp within the wals, but of force it muſt come forth and ſhew it ſelfe. And the wiſdome of a ſolitary Citizen is no more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, then the treaſure of a couetous man buried in the ground, which ferueth him no more, then if he poſſeſſed it not. What can be ſo great or noble, as that the vertue of euery particular man ſhoulde be ſeene, and brought forth, to be heard &amp; ſeene of all men. For it is not eaſely knowen of what capacity, wiſedome, and iudgement man is, vnleſſe proofe be made thereof. As the ſtrength of wraſtlers is knowen by the fall, and the ſwiftnes of the horſe by his carrire: ſo the vertue of a Senator, is by his actions tried. Thus haue we (as I hope) ſufficiently ſpoken of that diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, wherby a Counſellor becommeth happy, and fitt to gouerne the commonweale according to iuſtice. And ſith onely by the vertue of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that happines &amp; knowledge cannot be attained, the ſame is to be ſupplied by vſe. For we ought to learne, &amp; ſo long to learne, as we are ignorant, or (as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith) ſo long as we liue, &amp; repent not that we haue profited. The moſt aſſured ſigne that we haue profited in vertue, is, if we finde in ourſelues, that the force of our reaſon &amp; vertue hath ſuppreſſed vnreaſonable deſires and affections, and if among men, we haue liued iuſtly, wiſely, and temperately. But let vs now diſcourſe of the manner of choſing our Counſellor, determining therin chiefly to obſerue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines and equity. Among other things which do preſerue the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale <note place="margin">The elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.</note>&amp; happines therof, there is nothing better then to elect ſuch men for magiſtrates, as be indued with greateſt wiſedome, iudgement &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: and ſuch as aſpyre vnto honour, not by power, not by force, not by ambition, not by corruption; but by lawe, vertue, modeſty &amp; worthines. Magiſtracy in all commonweales is a thing of moſt reputation, becauſe the magiſtrates are called the beſt, wiſeſt, and moſt honorable men Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, is as it were an ornament of vertue, beſtowed on the beſt ſorte of men, for their vertue and well deſeruing of the ſtate. It is therefore the part of a good Citizen and good man, entring into magiſtracy, to <note place="margin">The duetie of a good magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</note>preferre the welfare &amp; honour of the commonweale before his priuate

For they woulde not liue with equalitie, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the fruite of priuate glory, before the profit and tranquilitie of their countrie.

Inſuch ſtates, men imbrace not that which is honeſt, but that which is profitable: <note place="margin">Magiſtracy ought be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, with out reſpect of riches.</note>for finding no rewarde due vnto vertue, euerie one holdeth the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man vnder, by fraude, deceipt, and power: ſo as the poorer ſorte doe liue in the commonweale oppreſſed with miſerie, and are forced to ſerue the rich, as more worthy perſons: not in reſpect of vertue, but of power, fraude, and ſubtiltie. For they doe alwaies preferre priuate v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitie, before honeſtie and vertue, ſelling, coarſing, and reiecting all lawes, liberty, rightes and iuſtice it ſelfe. <hi>Iugurtha,</hi> ſeeing great ſtore of corruptible Senators in <hi>Rome</hi> (as it were exclaming) ſaide: That that Citie was ſalable, and would quickely periſh, if any buier coulde be founde. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> conſulting of the continuance of their ſtate, were by
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7093:32"/>
               <hi>Appollo</hi> anſwered. That <hi>Sparta</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed by no meanes, but onely by auarice: and to auoyde that fatall prediction, they reiected the vſe of all golde, ſiluer, and braſſe, making a coyne of iron, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with men ſhould be leſſe delighted, and in keeping thereof more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. Great care therfore muſt be taken in euery commonweale, that the offices ſhould not be giuen rather to the rich then the vertuous men, and that thoſe may be puniſhed, that ſeeke with money to oppreſſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. For it is a moſt readie meane to bring that ſtate to ruine, where more regard is had to riches then vertue, becauſe the ſubiectes will labour rather to attaine welth then vertue, diſpoſing themſelues wholly to heape vp coyne, which maketh them effeminate; fraudulent, deſirous of other mens goods, laſciuious, and abounding in all kindes of vices. Where vertue is not eſteemed, the Prieſt contemneth pietie, the ſoldier layeth by his ſworde, the Senator ſeeketh not wiſedome, fidelitie and diligence, and the people make no account of ciuill diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; which ſo being, into their places entereth, audaciouſnes, violence, iniuſtice, laſciuiouſnes, and barbariſme, the ſinke of all vices. It is therefore neceſſary, that good order and forme be obſerued in the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of magiſtrates, ſo as in the choiſe, chiefe reſpect may be had to the vertue of good men. As touching the meane offices of ſtate, by what order they ſhould be beſtowed, it is not our intent to diſcourſe. It ſhall ſuffice, that the lawes and common cuſtome be therein obſerued. But for ſo much as among all ſortes of magiſtrates, the place of him whom we call a Counſellor is of moſt reputation, vpon him (as it were a foundation) the whole waight of all other Counſels, and welfare of the commonweale reſteth. It behoueth therefore that the choiſe of <note place="margin">Euill magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the confuſion of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweals</note>him be made with great care and circumſpection.

               <note place="margin">In the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors three things to be conſidered.</note>Therefore in election of Counſellors, theſe three things are chiefly to be obſerued: of whome, to whome, and how they ought be choſen. To the firſt we haue (as I hope) already ſufficiently ſpoken, when we ſaid that in the number of naturall ſubiects the Counſellor ought be
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7093:33"/>
elected, and thereof a little before we diſcourſed: Nowe are we to tell to whome, and how Counſellors are to be choſen. Wherein we haue thought good to reſite the cuſtomes of other commonweales, which being knowen, we may the more eaſely conceiue what kinde of election fitteth with euery ſtate, and which of them ought be accounted beſt and moſt profitable. In the election of all Magiſtrates, and chiefly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, all people in euery ſtate were wont to reſpect three things, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, riches and vertue. For what doth depende of thoſe three, and euery of them, is to be conſidered. Thoſe that deſire the forme of a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular ſtate, doe chiefly reſpect liberty, for there is nothing that l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Becauſe they thinke libertie conſiſteth principall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e in commaunding and obeying by turne, iudging it reaſonable, that all Citizens ſhould commaund, or at the leaſt ſomtimes to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to obey. Therfore in all ſuch commonweales, the Magiſtrates are choſen by lott, wherin Chance &amp; Lucke doe helpe more, then Reaſon or Wiſdome. Which order was inuented for the preſeruation of liberty. For all men deſiring to be thought and accounted equals, doe vſe therein the ayde of fortune &amp; chance, to the end that the rich &amp; poore, the eloquent and ſimple, the mightie and weake, the wiſe and fooliſh, ſhoulde be equall, &amp; that no one by wealth, eloquence, wiſedome or friendſhip, ſhoulde oppreſſe an other, and conſequently vſurpe the ſtate with the libertie thereof common to them all. Imagening moreouer, that the common good, profit, and liberty, may be preſerued, better by many then one, or diuers. In thoſe ſtates therefore the condition of all men is a like, and it maketh no matter whether they be rich or poore, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or fooliſh, ſo long as they be borne free men. In commonweales gouerned by a fewe, the order is, that a ſmall number of wiſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete, or rich men ſhould gouerne, but in popular ſtates it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, for there the ignoble, poore men and artifizers, haue equall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caedence with the rich men. Wee reade that the popular ſtate of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Athenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale.</note>was gouerned in two ſortes: the one, by fewe Magiſtrates, which were eyther rich men or wiſe men, the other conſiſted of all the whole number of free Citizens. The firſt was inſtituted by <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus,</hi> who aſſembled the people into Cities, liuing before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed ſauagely in the fielde, perſwading the moſt potente per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, that the <hi>Democratie</hi> ought be preferred before the Monarchie;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7093:33"/>
to the ende the ſoueraigntie ſhould reſt in the people, and he himſelfe would be but as a Captaine generall in warre, and defender of the law: but in all other reſpectes euery of them ſhould be his equals. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he inſtituted a conuocation of the whole people, making this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the Noble men and Artificers &amp; Houſbandmen; that is to wit, that the noble ſort ſhould haue the miniſterie of the Church, the ſoueraigne offices, and iudiciall places: but otherwiſe to liue in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall honour and dignitie with the reſt. This firſt Prince (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) would not frame any kingdome, but conforming himſelfe to the diſpoſition of people, contriued ſuch a commonweale, as in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all men was thought moſt allowable, moſt iuſt and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentfull. In like manner he deuiſed ſuch a popular ſtate, as ſhould not be gouerned by violence and furie of the multitude, but all things to be qualified by iudgement and reaſon, ſo as by honeſt liuing and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of lawe, the commonweale might enioy her happines. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale begon by <hi>Theſeus,</hi> was after gouerned by <hi>Draco,</hi> who gaue thereunto certaine bloodie lawes. Then <hi>Solon</hi> through ſedition &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of the Citizens, reduced the gouerment into the handes of a fewe, ſomewhat altering the lawes and magiſtrates. Laſt of all, that <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratie</hi> came vnto the hands of <hi>Cliſthenes, Ariſtides</hi> and <hi>Pericles,</hi> and after all them, to <hi>Demosthenes.</hi> Theſe men being pleaſers of people, reduced all the Citizens to equalitie, increaſing the tribes, entering ſeruantes and ſtrangers into the company of Citizens. <hi>Cliſthenes</hi> inuented the lawe called <hi>Oſtraciſmus,</hi> which was executed vpon thoſe of whome there was any opinion conceiued, that their wiſedome or vertue might hinder the popular liberty. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> iudged it a thing reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that baniſhed men and the baſeſt multitude, ſhould be capable of magiſtracie. <hi>Pericles</hi> diminiſhed the authoritie of the Senate, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the dignitie thereof. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> finding the ſtate fully in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the multitude, by a ſolemne oration allowed and commended <note place="margin">What kinde of Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is iuſt.</note>thereof. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and his Tutor <hi>Plato,</hi> with other politicall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, doe thinke that the popular forme of commonweale is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, being accompanied with good lawes, and a people willing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the ſame. For who is he that can miſlike that ſtate, wherein each man hath a lawe, to be as king and keeper of his libertie, and of the lawe, himſelfe is Prince and Lorde. Surely I coulde well allowe of ſuch a commonweale, where it not ſubiect to greate tumultes,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7093:34"/>
               <note place="margin">Democracy inconſtant.</note> ſeditions and ſodaine mutations. Firſt, who is he that knoweth not the nature of common people is mutable, and will vſe libertie immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately. For indeed, the multitude eyther obeyeth ſlauiſhly, or doth commaund cruellie: being alſo entiſed or rather filled with the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of libertie, ſo ſoone as it hath by ſome action aſpired to greatneſſe or glorie, it becommeth inſolent, deſiring to be thought chiefe, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding equalitie vniuſt, doth vſe moſt intemperately to beare hate, ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ambition. So as, of ſuch a commonweale groweth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent plebeyall domination. It alſo ſometimes happeneth, that men blinded with loue of riches and wealth, doe choſe rich men onely to be gouerners and keepers of common libertie, ſuppoſing them to be moſt worthy and fit to beare office in the ſtate. Such a commonweale is called the authoritie of a fewe, or an <hi>Oligarchia,</hi> for thoſe Citizens doe beare the ſoucraigne offices, who are aboue the reſt of moſt wealth and ſubſtance. The Senators and other Magiſtrates in that ſtate, are <note place="margin">Who are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates in an Oligarchia.</note>partly by election, partly by lot, and partly by generall conſent, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time by a fewe created. And becauſe the choiſe is made according to mens riches, each man indeuoreth himſelfe not to attaine vertue but welth, knowing the offices are as it were thereunto due. In ſuch commonweales, ſo greate veneration and worſhip is giuen to riches, as there is nothing ſo holie, ſo godlie or religious, that coueto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſneſſe, (the fatall plague of all gouermentes,) cannot violate and ſubuerte. They that in the election of Magiſtrates doe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpect vertue, and by it doe meaſure the felicitie of the ſtate, doe <note place="margin">VVhat kinde of magiſtrates are choſen in Monarchies and Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note>inhabite kingdomes or <hi>Optimaties.</hi> For thoſe that obey Kinges, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be by election or naturall diſcent, the people beleeue them aboue all other men to be moſt diuine, moſt wiſe and moſt worthy. And they that deſire to be gouerned not by one alone but diuers, doe in election of their gouernours obſerue the like reaſon. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe among thoſe men choiſe is made of the beſt, moſt iuſt, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient perſons to be Magiſtrates, without attributing any thing to lot or fortune: for each man examineth his owne iudgement touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vertue of them, whome they deſire to aduance, which is a reſpect of ſingular commendation in the beſtowing of honours. For (as the Poet ſaith) it is a great matter to be poynted out with the finger, euerie one ſaying, this is he. Whereſoeuer chance hath more power then reaſon, there is little place left for vertue.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7093:34"/>
Yet doe I not, in a free ſtate miſlike the ſuffrage of chance, that goeth <note place="margin">What kinde of lotting is beſt.</note>before or followeth the iudgement of good men, touching particular mens vertue. For in that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale where is moſt plenty of good men, there to admit chance for iudge of each mans worthines, may be thought reaſonable. By that meanes men in office ſhall account themſelues the moſt worthie Citizens, knowing they are aduanced aſwell by the iudgement of good men, as the ſentence of fortune. This order of election is obſerued by the <hi>Venetians.</hi> The like inſtitution <hi>Solon</hi> did make in <hi>Athens</hi> for choſing the 500 Senators. For out of euery Tribe was choſen ſo many, as were thought fit to become Senators whoſe names they vſed to put into one Pott, and into an other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Pott as many beanes, the one halfe white, the other halfe blacke, then ſo many as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened vpon the white beanes were pronounced Senatos, and thoſe that lighted vpon the blacke beanes as repulced, returned home without office. Therefore <hi>Thucydides</hi> called that Counſell <hi>Senatum a Faba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the <hi>Romaines</hi> (ſometime Lordes of the whole worlde) the Senators were choſen diuers waies, according to the diuerſitie of times. <note place="margin">VVhat conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations the Romans had in the electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Senators.</note>For eyther they were choſen by the Kings, Conſuls, Dictators, Tribunes of the people, Cenſors or Chieftaines. In all which elections till the time of <hi>Augustus</hi> no mention is made of lottings, but the vertue, fame, familie, age, order, office before borne, wealth, and profeſſion were chiefly reſpected Nowe for ſo much as there is nothing more excellent, nor more diuine then vertue, we thinke expedient, that in the choiſe of Counſellors chiefe regard muſt be had thereunto, becauſe through it, Counſellors be made iuſt, valiant and wiſe. It behoueth all Magiſtrats, in euery well gouerned commonweale to be indued with vertues, and chiefly thoſe that are aſpired to the dignity of Couſellors. For Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors be reputed the defenders of lawes, the moderators of liberty, and conſeruers of the whole commonweale. And as the commonweale is many times infected and corrupeed, by the vices and wickednes of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates: <note place="margin">The euill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates worſe then their vices.</note>ſo is the ſame corrected and repaired by their vertues: Neyther is the miſchiefe of their faultes ſo great, as that many others will imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate thoſe euill examples. Such are the people of euery ſtate, as are the manners of thoſe that gouerne; and what mutation of manners the Prince vſeth, the ſame is by the ſubiectes followed. <hi>Plato</hi> moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently and wiſely ſaith, that the eſtate of commonweales is changed, like vnto the alteration of muſitions voyces. But it was better ſaid of one
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7093:35"/>
other, that the change of a Princes life, &amp; the alteration of maners in great Magiſtrates, would alſo change the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners, cuſtoms, inſtitutions, rights &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale it ſelfe. And truely I think that euil Princes do deſerue worſt of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweale, not in that they do euill-themſelues, but that thereby all others become infected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore the vices are noe ſo hurtful, as are their vicious exſamples. Such men therefore as not onely with their owne actions, but their examples doe preiudice the ſtate, are moſt ſeuerely to be puniſhed. How is it poſſible, for any man to perſwade others to vertue and obſeruation of lawe, himſelfe liuing otherwiſe? The <hi>Romaines</hi> laughed <hi>Scylla</hi> to ſcorne, that being a man moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate and delighting in licenciouſnes, did notwithſtanding vſe to exhorte and compell others to ſobrietie, temperance and frugali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <note place="margin">Lyſander.</note>Who woulde not alſo finde faulte with <hi>Lyſander,</hi> though he did contrarie to <hi>Scylla,</hi> allowe thoſe vices in the Citizens from which <note place="margin">Lycurgus.</note>himſelfe refrained. But <hi>Lycurgus</hi> is in deede iuſtlie to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, becauſe he neuer commanded others to doe any thing, which himſelfe would not firſt doe and firmely obſerue. Therefore they, vnto whome the commonweale hath giuen authoritie to chooſe Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors and other Magiſtrates, ought to be of greate iudgement, and high wiſedome. For they ſhoulde electe thoſe whome they thinke to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell all others in witt, wiſedome, iudgement, vertue and good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I doe therefore greatly diſlike the popular order of lotting, to finde out men fitt for this purpoſe, becauſe the people by helpe thereof, deſiring to preſerue their equalitie and libertie, doe incurre ſuch errour, as they commonly chooſe men moſt vnworthy the name and vertue of a Senator. Wherefore they ought in preferuing of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, to be moſt carefull of that which might chiefly profit the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale, not giuing (in reſpect of commaunding and obeying by turne) the gouernment to the ſlouthfull and fooliſh ſort: for euery man liueth with equalitie enough in the ſtate, ſo long as the ſame be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">VVhat elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratesis moſt perfect.</note>by the wiſeſt, diſcreteſt and graueſt Citizens.

Surely it is a thing moſt perilous, that the magiſtrates of any ſtate ſhould be choſen by the multitude, which is no reaſonable of indifferent iudge of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthines. For many times, eyther it enuieth or fauoureth thoſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome they giue their libertie, not iudging according to reaſon, but is often moued by fauour, or drawen with deſire to honour thoſe that ambitiouſly labour to aſpyre. And to conclude, whenſoeuer the multitude doe make choiſe, the ſame is not performed according to diſcretion, knowledge, and iudgement, but fury and raſhnes. There is not (as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith) any Counſell, Reaſon, Iudgement, or diligence in the baſe people, and wiſe men haue euer thought good to ſuffer thoſe things which the people doe, but not euer to commende their doings. The multitude haue alwaies had the deſire, but not the iudgement to beſtow the dignities, for their voyces are wonne by flattery, not gained by deſert. This cuſtome being by lawe or vſe allowed in other common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales, <note place="margin">The election of Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to one.</note>ſhall not be admitted in our ſtate; forwe recommend the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Counſellor, to one alone, being of all men iudged for vertue, wiſdome &amp; knowledge moſt worthy: thinking, that one may more eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then many, eſchew thoſe perils, which happen in choſing Counſellors. But let him to whome this authority belongeth, receiue the ſame as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him by lawe or conſent of the people, &amp; not aſpyre therto by force, corruption or Tyranny. The cuſtome of free people, in the election of their Senators, vnto whome they commit their welfare, is to choſe them
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7093:36"/>
among themſelues, or elſe to giue that authoritie of election to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which we reade the <hi>Romaines</hi> ſometimes to haue done, who did not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues chooſe the Senate, as they did other magiſtrates, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the doing thereof to one man alone, of moſt excellencie, good life, manners, authoritie, wiſedome, and iudgement. <hi>Romulus</hi> the firſt father of that Citie, elected a hundred Senators, which cuſtome was vſed by the other kings ſucceeding. But when the kings (through the inſolent gouernment of <hi>Tarquintus)</hi> were remoued, this power of election (according to the qualitie of time) was ſomewhat altered, yet not giuen to many. For till the ſtate returned to a Monarchie, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators were choſen eyther by the Conſuls, the Cenſor, the dictator, or cheiftaine. Our anceſtors haue moſt diſcretely brought that cuſtome of the <hi>Romaines</hi> into this commonweale, giuing vnto the Kinge power and authority to make choiſe of Counſellors, and be an onely iudge of each mans vertue; electing thoſe whome for age, wiſedome, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie he thought worthie. We therefore doe determine the power and right of electing Counſellors, to appertaine onely vnto the king, wherein, his greateſt wiſedome and iudgement ought be employed, not calling any to Counſell for ſkill in domeſticall affaires, for riches gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by agriculture, nor for ſkill in architecture: but for wiſedome in gouernment of the commonweale, for preſeruation of Subiects, and knowledge in good and wholſome lawes. If our bodies be diſeaſed with ſicknes, we conſult with learned Phiſitions, or if we want gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or howſes, we ſeeke for ſkillfull Artificers: why ſhould we not alſo (as a thing of moſt importance) looke out and chooſe ſuch men to gouerne the people and commonweale, whoſe wiſedome can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the ſame in peace and tranquilitie. It therefore behoueth a Prince in the choiſe of ſuch men, to vſe the whole force of his capacitie, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <note place="margin">What things are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected in choiſe of Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For he is not onely to ſee, that in the Counſellor there be thoſe partes whereof we haue ſpoken; to wit, that he be a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſubiect, well borne and bred, and indued with thoſe artes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines, which are thought worthy a ciuill man deſtined to gouerne the ſtate, but he muſt alſo conſider the quality of his manners, fame, fame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, age and vertue. It is moreouer to be knowen in what office or ſeruices the Counſellor (before his election) hath bene vſed, and with how much endeuour, fidelity, wiſedome, and diligence he hath ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: For from ſome other place of imployment, the Counſellor
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7093:36"/>
ought be choſen: which the <hi>Romaines</hi> vſed, electing their Senators onely out of that number, whome they called <hi>Patres,</hi> which was as it were, the nourſerie of Counſellors. To be ſhort, whoſoeuer cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Counſellors, ought aboue all, to lay before his eyes the profit of the commonweale, whereby he ſhall eaſely conceiue, what men and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors the ſtate wanteth, and how much or little euerie one can helpe, how great a burthen each man can beare, and what is to waighty for his force. Let vs hereafter diſcourſe wherein all theſe thinges conſiſt, what good the ſtate receiueth by a Counſellors wiſedome, and what dueties he is bound vnto. By that which hath beene alreadie ſaide, the King may ſufficiently conceiue what things are conſiderable, to knowe a perfect Counſellor, and likewiſe a Counſellor ſhall finde what is to be obſerued and vſed in gouerning.

               <hi>Cyrus</hi> in conquering kingdomes was happy, but in holding them vnhappy, he knewe the arte to winne, but was ignorant how to keepe. And ſurely thoſe daies wherein we are preſerued, ought be to vs more deere, then that wherein we were borne. Likewiſe they doe better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue of mankinde, whoſe wiſedome hath deuiſed the welfare of men, then they, from whome their generation or conception proceedeth. I doe therefore wiſh the Counſellor to be indued with ſuch knowledge, as conſulteth not onely vpon things preſent, but alſo foreſeeth things to come, comprehending in minde the whole ſtate, diligently conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the chances, perils, mutations and inclinations thereof, wherby he ſhall with more facilitie conceiue the miſchieues which happen, and <note place="margin">The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſtates ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable.</note>eyther by foreſeeing diuert them, or being growen, extirpe them. Neyther doe I thinke fit, that our Counſellor ſhould be igorant in the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of other ſtates, for by ſuch examples he may conceiue the lawes wherewith they are gouerned, the manners they haue vſed, in what
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7093:38"/>
ſort they haue beene altered, amended, and preſerued. Likewiſe with what authoritie each lawe is made, what is the order of their publique Counſels, with the duetie belonging to euery of them, what libertie, dignitie, authoritie and iuriſdiction appertaineth to euerie common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale. In this our ſtate, for ſo much as the Senate is a meane betwixt the king and people, it behoueth euery Senator to know, what is the <note place="margin">The ſtate of Polonia.</note>maieſty of a king, his greathes and iuriſdiction, and likewiſe what is the right and libertie of ſubiectes, becauſe the king and people many times contende one againſt the other, the one deſiring immeſurable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, the other affecting oppreſſion. The intemperate contention of thoſe humors doe greatly afflict the commonweale. For if the one doth preuaile, he putteth on the perſon of a Tyrant, or if the other be victorious, thereof are engendred as many thouſande Tyrantes as heads of men. The tyrannie of many, is alwaies more cruell then of one. For the one taketh ende eyther by death, or by ſacietie of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding, but the inſolent and inſatiable licentiouſnes of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, doth feede the vaine of tyrannie; the venome whereof, doth long after infecte their poſteritie. Therefore the Senate ought be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding diligent in preſeruing the libertie due and common to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one, and from that meane place, (as from a watching houſe or tower) to foreſee the welfare of all, and take order that through ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or contention the commonweale be not indemnyfied. For the Senate is a iudge betwixt force and feare, libertie and ſeruitude, the <note place="margin">The art of Tyrantes.</note>king and people. Tyrantes were wonte to vſe certaine ſleightes, in arming themſelues againſt the liberty of people. Firſt by remouing all good and wiſe men, with euerie other perſon hauing power in the ſtate (becauſe the vertue of good men is to Tyrantes ſuſpected) and that one, compell the reſt eyther by feare or force to become ſeruile, and they themſelues to doe all things according to their owne luſt and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Such counſell <hi>Periander</hi> gaue vnto <hi>Thraſibulus,</hi> perſwading him to cut of the higheſt ſpikes of corne, meaning be ſhould put the moſt noble <hi>Athenians</hi> to death. The like ſubtiltie was followed by <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Tarquinius</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Lucius.</hi> He being ſuborned by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, pretending to be baniſhed, fled fraudulently vnto the <hi>Gabii,</hi> where hauing ſo much acquaintance and friendſhip as he thought ſuffized, ſent ſecretly vnto his father to knowe what his pleaſure was ſhoulde be done, who leading the meſſenger into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7093:39"/>
there walked, and in his preſence with his ſtaffe ſtrake of the heads of all the Dazles, which being reported to his ſonne, he put the chiefe noble men of <hi>Gabia</hi> to death, by force and iniuſtice vſurping the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale and liberty. The Tyrants doe alſo oftentimes inhibite the ſocietie of Subiects, their meetings, their conferences, conuentions, feaſtings, and the ſtudie of honeſt diſciplines. Tyrantes alſo many times, doe ſowe diſcord among the people, to the ende, that filled with hate and priuate diſpleaſure, they may diſpoſe themſelues to warre and ſedition, and thereby be impoueriſhed, and being poore, and the warre ended, the offenders are forced to pay for pardon, ſo that euery way fleeſed of their riches and made needie, they doe become baſe minded and vnſit to defende both liberty and well doing. Theſe and many ſuch like things the Counſellor ought indeuor himſelfe to knowe, and by foreſight prouide that the commonweale be not by thoſe meanes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. <note place="margin">The office of Kinges.</note>Let him likewiſe vnderſtand, that the office of a king is not to care or ſtudie ſo much for his owne priuate profit, as the common commoditie of his ſubiectes, to obſerue his lawes; to preſerue the rights and liberty of the people, and to maintaine the authority and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his counſell. For kings were inſtituted to aid good men againſt the wicked and vngodly, and to them was giuen abſolute power to reuenge iniuries, preſerue liberty, and beiudges of each mans vertues and vices. A good king ought therefore to haue no leſſe care of thoſe he gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, then hath the ſhepheard of his flocke, that is, to make them bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and happy. <hi>Homer</hi> calleth king <hi>Agomemnon</hi> the ſheepheard of people, whom <hi>Plato</hi> doth imitate, calling him ſheepheard and keeper of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. Moreouer a king ought to gouerne his people: Not as maiſters doe their ſeruants, but as the father ruleth his children. Wherefore, as it is the part of good parents ſometimes to rebuke their children, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to admoniſh and cheriſh them; and ſometimes alſo to correct and puniſh them. So ſhoulde a Prince behaue himſelfe towardes his ſubiectes, as well for the peoples preſeruation, as the ſafetie of the commonweale, ſhewing himſelfe ſometimes ſeuere, ſometimes gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and placable, defending and enlarging the common profit with no leſſe care, then a father prouideth for the ſuſtentation of <note place="margin">The differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixt kings and Tyrants.</note>his children. Thus appeareth the difference betwixt kinges and Tyrantes, the one doth care for the common commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the other ſtudieth onely for priuate profitte. The ende
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7093:39"/>
of the Tyrants indeuour, is voluptuouſnes, but the ende of a kinges ſtudie is honour. To excell in riches is proper to Tyrants, but a kings chiefe deſire, is honour. A Tyrant deſireth the ayde of ſtrangers, but a king is garded with his owne ſubiectes. <hi>Alfonſus</hi> king of <hi>Arragon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked which of his ſubiectes he helde moſt deare? anſwered, I loue them better that wiſh me well, then thoſe that feare me: which ſeemeth reaſonable, becauſe feare is accompanied with hatered. A King therefore ſhould be no more ſafe by defence of Armes, then loue, good will, and fidelitie of ſubiectes. He is alſo to be honored as the miniſter of publique Counſell, the defender of lawes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruer of common right and liberty. For better performing of all which offices, he ſhall doe well to harken to the aduiſe of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors and (as his parentes) loue and honour them. <hi>Traianus</hi> that great Emperour of the world, vſed continually to call the Senate his father: For like as the father doth foretell his ſonne of thoſe things he thinkes profitable: ſo doth a Senate Counſell the king howe the ſtate may be preſerued, and by what lawes and orders it ſhoulde be gouerned. Of theſe and other thinges appertayning to the office of a king, or that haue beene receiued by lawe, vſe or cuſtome, a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor <note place="margin">The popular ſort incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</note>ought to be fully enformed. The popular ſorte of men, is for the moſt parte mutable, by reaſon of the diuerſitie of their ages. For of them, ſome being young, ſome olde, and ſome of middle age, it muſt needs be, that great diſſentions ſhould ariſe, euery man hauing a will and opinion diuers from others, and becauſe they are all free men, each man frameth his life and manners according to his owne fancie, ſuppoſing there is libertie, where all men doe that which they luſt and like. The diuerſitie of manners doth breede among them varietie of mindes, and thereof doth followe ſundry iudgementes touching the ſtate, lawe, and liberty, whereof hate, diſpleaſure and ſeditions doe enſue, ſo as all men are not equallie affected to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale.</p>

               <note place="margin">VVho are good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes.</note> Thoſe that be honeſtlie brought vp, naturally good, and well trained in learning, not ſurious, nor voluptuous, not womanniſh or licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly giuen, are moſt willing obſeruers of lawes, rights, concord, and ciuill ſociety, not ſweruing (as men ſay) one inch from the rules of vertue, fidelity, &amp; glory of their anceſtors, becauſe they keepe and retaine all thoſe things as inheritance deſcended from their forefathers. That ſorte
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7093:40"/>
of men is in the commonweale to be reputed good ſubiectes: But they whoſe follie hath bene nouriſhed by domeſticall libertie, being borne at home and not trained vp abroad, wherby they haue neuer ſeene, done, or <note place="margin">Seditious ſubiectes.</note>heard any thing notable, magnificent or noble, are to be thought perſons ſeditious, craſtie and perilous ſubiectes, yet would they be called and thought good, honeſt, quiet and modeſt, notwithſtanding the contempt they haue to imitate honeſtmen. And to the ende they ſhoulde not be thought blockheades and fit for nothing, deuiſe ſome new practiſe to gaine themſelues fame, glory and commendation. And it commeth many times to paſſe, that pretending the patronage of liberty, by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique perſwaſion and furie, they take matters in hande in apparance godlie, but in trueth profane. And if any of them be by birth or educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion apt for ſedition, and excell the reſt in witt and eloquence, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelues vnto the ignorant ſort to be captaines and reformers of lawes, religion, and order, conſpiring againſt the King, the Counſell and all good ſubiectes, as men that had taken in hand the renoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole commonweale: Such men were of the <hi>Romanes</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Plebicolae.</hi> who to ſaue themſelues from ſome puniſhment which before they deſerued, doe take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the name of defending liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſtirring newe troubles and alterations in the ſtate; eyther elſe moued by ſome ſodaine furie of minde, doeperſwade the people to diſcorde and ſedition, or elſe hauing intangled or rather prodigally conſumed their inheritance and ſubſtance, (deſirous to haue fellowes in miſerie, and periſh rather publiquely then alone,) were alwaies wont to attempt rebellion. Of ſuch diſpoſition were the <hi>Romaines</hi> called <hi>Gracchus, Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, Catiline.</hi> And in <hi>Athens Caliſtines,</hi> with many others.</p>
            <p>As the bodie of our commonweale conſiſteth in the coniunction of three eſtates, whoſe vniuerſall conſent and temperature doth make it moſt perfect and happy: ſo if the ſame bodie be deuided or diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that ſtate becommeth of all others the moſtlame, imperfect, and infortunate. For all other commonweales are ſubiect to one onely mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, becauſe they reſt vpon one onely ſimple gouernment: But our ſtate being mixed and made of three, muſt of force be ſubiect to as many conuerſions and inclinations. If the king abuſeth his office, the ſtate hath one Tyrant, if the Senate ſo doe, there are diuers Tyrants. But if the power of people doth ſurpaſſe the authority and force of both the other, then the commonweale is afflicted with an infinite number of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7093:40"/>
moſt pernicious Tyrants. Wherefore if in ſuch a State, the office, libertie, dignitie, authoritie and iuriſdiction of euery of them, be not confined and bound by lawes certaine, ſo as both by feare and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they be compelled to obſerue lawe and liue honeſtlie, all good men ſhall there in vaine looke for quietnes.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The office of Counſellors.</note> The proper office of a Conſellor (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) is to imagine he beareth the perſon of the ſtate: the reputation whereof, he is bound to maintaine, to obſerue the lawes, ſet forth the proceedinges, and be mindfull of things, committed to his fidelitie. Alſo it becommeth him <note place="margin">The duetie of priuate perſons.</note>as a priuate man, to liue in equality with other ſubiects, neither debaſing nor extolling him ſelfe, and to deſire onely thoſe things in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, which be peaceable and honeſt: ſo ſhall euerie one performe the true duetie of a good and loyall ſubiect. It alſo becommeth ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects moderately to vſe their libertie. For as <hi>Quintius</hi> ſaide, temperate libertie is profitable to euery Citie, but ouermuch libertie is euill, and maketh men headdie or deſperate. To ſuppreſſe the licentiouſnes of euill ſubiects, ſeueritie of lawe is required: Therefore it behoueth the ſtate to foreſee, that through not puniſhing of euill mens offences, the good ſubiects be forced to ſuffer at their handes. For the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale ought be accounted the poſſeſſion of good and not of euill men. Moreouer, it cannot be, but in euery commonweale, ſeditions and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will ariſe, and <hi>(Hannibal</hi> ſaid) there was no great Citie that could liue long in quiet, vnleſſe it had ſome enemies abroade, becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, domeſticall foes would therein ariſe. And as mightie bodies <note place="margin">Great ſtates moſt ſubiect to trouble.</note>ſeeme aſſured from externall harme, ſo are they euer bourdened with their owne waight. Beſides that, ſith we are men, we muſt not (as the <hi>Comoedian</hi> ſaith) thinke our ſelues free from any miſaduenture that may happen to mankind. For although we be wiſe, prouident and good, yet are we men, and by inſtinct of nature leſſe proan to vertue then vice, and in like ſort there is no Citie that wanteth wicked, vicious and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly people. Therefore whenſoeuer the floode of troubles doth <note place="margin">In appeaſing ſedition, what order is to be taken.</note>happen to ariſe in the ſtate, the office of a Counſellor (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) is patiently to indure the peoples wilfulneſſe, to winne the heartes of thoſe that are vnaſiured, keepe them that are alreadie wonne appeaſe the offended, and aboue all prouide that the worſt ſort may not in any thing haue the aduantage: It is not alſo amiſſe that ſometimes he winke and ſeeme not to ſee, ſo that thoſe faultes whereat he winketh
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7093:41"/>
doe proceede rather of errour then wilfulneſſe. But to pardon ſuch as voluntarilie haue offended or committed any impious act againſt the commonweale, the honeſt orders of men, or the lawe, is not onely to be thought pernicious, but alſo wicked and deteſtable. Wherefore in ſuppreſſing ſo great a furie and raſhneſſe of mens fancies, the Counſellor ought to employ great wiſedome and diligence, and let him therein chiefly vſe thoſe two precepts which <hi>Cicero</hi> reciteth from <note place="margin">Precepts of Plato.</note>the mouth of <hi>Plato,</hi> the one is, that alwaies he looke well vnto the common profit, referring thereunto all his actions, and forget euery priuate reſpect: the other is, to be carefull for the whole bodie of the commonweale, leaſt in taking the protection of part, he doth aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the reſt. For who ſo defendeth one onely ſort of men, doth induce hatred and ſedition: which two plagues, doe debilitate and ſubuert the ſtate. He ought therefore to be as carefull of the people as of the King, of the nobilitie as of the meaner ſort, of the rich as of the poore, of the wiſe, as the ſimple, and ſo conſequently of all ſortes and eſtates of men. The omiſſion of which rule, was that which afflicted the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> and filled <hi>Rome</hi> with ſedition, tumults and ciuill warres. Let him therefore in al things obſerue indifferencie and equalitie, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the commonweale ſhalbe aſſured, and the people in good will, loue, <note place="margin">Equalitie of commonw. of great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie.</note>and peace preſerued. In that ſtate where ſmall reſpect is borne vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie, there quarrell, contention, and enmitie doe dailie ariſe: which commeth to paſſe, for that men equall do aſpyre to things vnequall, or vnequall men to things equal. But men of one fortune do beſt conſort together, and like will to like as the prouerbe ſaith. They therfore that excell others in riches or birth, are not to be preferred, neyther are they to be equally eſteemed who are equall in liberty, but thoſe that excell <note place="margin">Wherein e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth.</note>others in vertue, are to be accounted both ſuperiors and equals: that is, in reſpect of law or number, (as the <hi>Arithmetricians</hi> call it) they are equall, but in dignitie, they are ſuperiour, becauſe in the beſtowing of honours, vertue is chiefly reſpected. For who ſo is moſt vertuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerueth moſt honour and glorie, and this equalitie becauſe it is meaſured by reaſon and iudgement, is called <hi>Geometricall.</hi> I doe therefore thinke fit that the Senator ſhould obſerue both equalities. In the diſtribution of iuſtice and conſeruation of libertie, he is to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men indifferent. For whom the law hath made equall, ought to liue in rule and libertie, neither giuing nor taking from one more then
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7093:41"/>
an other, as the line of law doth direct him. The rule of which equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">Equalitie A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticall.</note>is eaſely obſerued. For the condition thereof is in all commonweales preſcribed, which is, that each man ſhould enioy ſo much as by lawe, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, or conuention to him appertaineth, wherin heede muſt be taken, that neither wealth, powre or parentage be reſpected, but that aſwell the poore as rich, the noble as ignoble may be equally iudged. As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equalitie, according to the iudgement of reaſon, whereby men <note place="margin">Equalitie Geometrical.</note>would be preferred and honoured more then others, is not ſo eaſelie diſcerned. For to iudge of each mans valewe, wiſedome and vertue, with the honours to them due, is rather proper to a deuine, then humaine wit. The reaſon thereof is, we are often deceiued in our opinion of that which is accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted good, neither be we euer vpright Iudges of other mens deſeruing. Herein therfore reſteth the difficultie, for who ſo can truely iudge of mens vertue, ſhall therby ſhew himſelf rather a God then man. In concluſion, the commonweale is not preſerued by any vertue more, then that: who ſo then in gouerning is a iuſt iudge of ech mans value &amp; vertue (for it reſteth in his cenſure,) &amp; knoweth alſo, vnto whoſe hands to commit or not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit the ſtate, whom to loue and whom to hate whom to reward and whom to puniſh, ſhall make the gouernment moſt quiet: but not knowing ſo to do, the ſame becommeth of all other the moſt wicked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> corruptible and diſordered. Therefore in popular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweales where the multitude is rude and ignorant of diſcourſe and reaſon the people are rewarded and puniſhed by lot, for they pray God that each man may find fortune according to his merit. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for ſo much as the temeritie of lotting, obeyeth rather to fortune then reaſon, in the conſeruation of equalitie we allowe of wiſedome and humaine pollecie to be Iudge, rather then fortune. With which vertues if the Counſellor be indued, he ſhal eaſelie diſcern what ought in all things to be done. And therein he ſhall imitate the duetie of a good husband. For he hauing within his houſe diuerſe honeſt perſons, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth one for his age, an other for his vertue, &amp; a third for his condition: So the Counſellor in the commonweale ſhould haue reſpect to each mans age, vertue, condition and calling. He muſt alſo vnderſtand the <note place="margin">Wherin law and populer libertie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth.</note>right &amp; liberty of people, (which as they think) do conſiſt chiefly in being capable of the offices, to haue power to make &amp; correct lawes, to ſpeake freely in matters that concerne liberty, law or iniury, not to be arreſted
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7093:42"/>
or impriſoned without order of lawe or authoritie, nor be vniuſtly iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, robbed or forced to pay tribute. They deſire moreouer not to obey officers contrarie to lawe, not to be hurt of thoſe that be more mightie, nor be oppreſſed by force, to haue libertie to deſire and doe allthinges that is not by law and reaſon forbidden, to defend their law and libertie from Tyrants, to be partakers of the Parliaments, to beleue the King of higheſt authority, &amp; the Councell of greateſt vnderſtanding. For where the Senate is Lord of publique Councelles, and all thinges by it deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, are of other eſtates of men obeyed, where libertie is in the people, authoritie in the King, the Councell in the Senate, there is the beſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of libertie and equalitie, chiefelie if the lawes be alwaies o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed. The Counſellor ought likewiſe to foreſee, that the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monweale be not moleſted with any ſedition, for in times of ſuch troubles, the life of men is miſerable and vnhappie. There is nothing <note place="margin">Sedition the po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſon of Commonw.</note>ſo deuine, humaine, holie or religious that ſedition doth not conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminate, diſturbe and ſubuert: That is the poyſon
of all ſtates, which maketh the greateſt dominions, ſmall and mortall. The cauſes of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in all commonweales are more then the witt and reaſon of man can imagine. Wherefore continuall watch ought to be, leſt the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe begun, ſhould more and more increaſe. The mindes of great men much honoured in the ſtate, muſt be reconciled, for the diſcords of mightie perſonages doe drawe the whole commonweale, &amp; of ſmall beginnings moſt miſerable euentes doe follow. In appeaſing ſedition two things are chiefly to be obſerued, that is, in what ſorte men are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <note place="margin">What to be conſidered in appeaſing ſedition.</note>to rebellion and for what cauſes. It happeneth ſometimes that mens mindes are moued with furie, deſire, feare, anger or ſuch like af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: eyther elſe they are drawen with couetiſe, gaine, contempt, iniurie, diſdaine, honour, and ſometimes with religion. Sedition doth alſo follow, where one part of the people doth gaine great reputation and authoritie ouer the reſt, and by ſome proſperous ſucceſſe beeing inſolente, deſire to be aduanced aboue others, as the <hi>Areopagi</hi> among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and the noble men of the <hi>Argiui,</hi> who hauing victorie of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> ſought to reiect the popular gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Alſo the multitude of <hi>Siracuſa</hi> puffed vp with pride of their proſperous warre vppon the <hi>Athenians,</hi> changed their ſtate from a <hi>Democratie</hi> to an <hi>Ochlocratie.</hi> In <hi>Rome</hi> likewiſe the multitude not induring the dignitie of the Senate, made manie motions,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7093:42"/>
and in the ende created <hi>Tribunes,</hi> by whoſe furie and inſolency, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Senate was diminiſhed, and by ſedition and troubles brought the ſtate to vtter deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Sedition doth alſo ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the commonweale, by reaſon one man doth exerciſe diuers offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which thing is perilous in euery ſtate, for that others doe ſeeme thereby defrauded, and iudged vnworthy of honour. Let each man therefore content himſelfe with one office, ſo ſhall the ſtate haue many miniſters with diligence to attende the well doing thereof. Yet is it ſometimes profitable, that in ſmall commonweales, one man ſhoulde exerciſe diuers offices, but in great ſtates the ſame vſeth to <note place="margin">In preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what the Counſellor ought doe.</note>moue ſedition. A Counſellor therefore ought foreſee, chiefly in extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of ſeditions, that nothing be done contrary to the ordinances, lawes and cuſtomes, preuenting all diſorders in due time: for miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe growing by little and little is not eaſely perceiued, but hauing gained force, it ſheweth it ſelfe and cannot be lightly ſuppreſſed. He ought alſo not to be ouer credulous of perſwaſions craftely inuented to abuſe the people, which are many times deuiſed by popular men and flatterers, who louing innouation, dare enterpriſe any thing to make them owners of their deſire, and reſting in that minde, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpyre againſt the proſperitie of good men, cloaking their vice with the raſhneſſe and fury of people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which flame and inſolency not being quenched in time, doth commonly runne ſo farre, as with the fire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the whole ſtate is conſumed. The commonweale therefore requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Counſell of ſome notable and diuine man, in whome it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſethe care of hir happines and welldoing. By his directions and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, all perils, ſeditions, diſcordes, mutations and inclinations may <note place="margin">In a perfect Counſellor fower vertues chiefly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note>he ſuppreſſed, and therby enioy a happy peace and tranquility. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer endeuoreth himſelfe to be ſuch a one, it behoueth him to be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, iuſt, valiant and temperate, for from thoſe fower vertues, all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine things, wordes, and workes doe proceede. Surely wiſedome is a great &amp; ſingular vertue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; ſo great, as I know not any thing in this world that may be therunto compared. For without it, the other vertues can neither be exerciſed nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended, which is the cauſe that <hi>Socrates</hi>

               <hi>Aristotle)</hi> doth call Prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the only ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: meaning, as I think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that without Prudence no vertue can be, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. <hi>Bion</hi> thought that Prudence excelled all other vertues, as far as the ſight doth exceed all the other ſenſes, affirming moreouer, that vertue to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7093:43"/>
be as proper to olde men, as ſtrength or currage was to yoong men. Wherfore we will that our Senator ſhould be indued with this vertue, for he can neyther ſay or doe any thing worthy his commendation and age, if the ſame be not, (as with a ſawſe) ſeaſoned with wiſedome. But what this prudence is and wherein it conſiſteth, it ſeemeth neceſſary we ſhoulde <note place="margin">What Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is.</note>heere declare. The <hi>Latines</hi> haue called this vertue <hi>Prudentia,</hi> of <hi>proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo,</hi> becauſe through it, the minde doth foreſee things to come, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth of things preſent, and remembreth things paſſed. For he that thinketh not of things paſt, forgetteth his life, and he that foreſeeth not things to come, is ſubiect to many perils, and vnaduiſedly falleth into euery miſaduenture. Prudence (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith,) is the knowledge of things good, euill, and indifferent, conſiſting wholly in the choſing and knowing what is to be deſired or eſchewed, and (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> thinketh) it is an habit coupled with perfect reaſon, apt for good action, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in thoſe things which may happen to men, well or euill. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Theoricall wiſedome. differeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Prudence.</note>
               <hi>Theoricall</hi> wiſedome, doth differ from <hi>Prudence:</hi> becauſe that paſſeth not the boundes of contemplation, and this is wholly giuen to action and humaine buſines. Moreouer this kinde of wiſedome needeth counſell and fortune, to defend thoſe things wherein it delighteth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is occupied in certaine and no variable ſciences, which is the cauſe that <hi>Geometricians, Mathematicians,</hi> (with all the crew of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and ſolitarie Philoſophers) are men learned, and skilfull, but not <note place="margin">Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, called rightly Sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes, but not Prudentes.</note>prudent. In like manner <hi>Diogenes, Zenocrates, Chryſippus, Carneades, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus, Metrocles, Ariſtippus, Anaxagoras</hi> and <hi>Thales</hi> were men of great knowledge, but not prudent; becauſe their manner of wiſedome or Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy was different from true prudence, being ignorant in thoſe things which were profitable for themſelues and others, delighting in matters ſecret, hidden, and obſcure; which ſciences, although they be good and notable, yet vnprofitable and impertinent to humaine felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Becauſe prudence conſiſteth in thoſe things whereof deliberation and counſell is to be taken, but if thoſe contemplatiue Philoſophers, had not eſtranged themſelues from the conuerſation and actions of men, but beene employed in the affayres of gouernment as was <hi>Pericles, Solon, Lycurgus, Plato, Demoſthenes, Cato, Cicero</hi> and others, they had (no doubt) <note place="margin">The originall of Prudence.</note>beene men in wiſedome moſt excellent. For true wiſedome proceedeth from perfect reaſon, which if the Counſellor attaineth, eyther by Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, ciuill diſcipline, or experience, he ſhall thereby know how to foreſee
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7093:43"/>
things to come, gouerne well and wiſely things repreſent, and when trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or doubtfull accidents happen, ſpeedely reſolue, and giue preſent counſell; according to the time and occaſion. <hi>Plato</hi> ſaide there were two things moſt notable in the life of man: the firſt was, a wiſe man to knowe all things, the ſecond to know himſelfe. Therefore with this moſt notable, great and diuine vertue, let our Counſellor be fully fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, for without it no reaſon, no vertue, no action nor cogitation can be good or perfect. The chiefe propertie or force of this wiſedome (as wiſe men affirme) it to be wiſe for our ſelues: becauſe the prudent man doth firſt ſettle his owne affaires, for wanting wiſdome to gouerne well his owne priuate eſtate, he may be rightly called fooliſh. Vnder Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is contained the skill of well handling matters domeſticall; the knowledge of making lawes, ciuill wiſedome, and the conning of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting and iudging. Therefore Prudence in a mans owne affaires, is <note place="margin">Prudence of two kindes.</note>by <hi>Cicero</hi> called domeſticall wiſedome; and the ſame vſed iu publique matters, is named ciuill wiſedome. For the perfect conceiuing of all theſe things, it behoueth him to vnderſtand what is true and iuſt, becauſe the knowing of trueth, is proper to Prudence. For if we abandon trueth, all things ſaid or done, will be falſe iniuſt and euill. Wherefore who ſo wiſely &amp; with a ſharpe conceipt ſeeth &amp; knoweth what in all things is <note place="margin">A wiſe man.</note>comely and true, performing the ſame ſpeedily &amp; wittely, is in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be reputed a wiſe man. And to the ende the wiſedome of a Counſellor may haue certaine groundes, whereunto his imagination may reſort for reaſons to leade him to the trueth, let him keepe in minde theſe two things: that is, honeſty and profit. Then whatſoeuer he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth or doth, eyther in priuate or publique, the ſame muſt be, (as at a marke) directed and leuelled by honeſty and profit. For all things which are conceiued by reaſon or expreſſed by ſpeach, within the boundes of theſe two are included. We therefore require a ſharpe and ſounde conceipt in finding out what is honeſt and profitable, leaſt the minde blinded with affections and deſires, doth ſeduce the iudgement of our Counſellor and leade him from the path of true reaſon. Many men there are, who finding themſelues to haue a little abuſed reaſon by giuing head to their affections &amp; luſtes, do fall forth with into opinions, from wiſdom diuers and contrarie, wherof followeth, that they are not onely deceiued in their opinion of things honeſt &amp; profitable, but are alſo with the loue of diſhoneſty &amp; improfitable deſires blinded. For auoiding wherof theſe
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7093:44"/>
               <note place="margin">What is to be eſchewed in Prudence.</note> two errors muſt be eſchewed. Firſt not to take things vnknowen for knowen and raſhly aſſent vnto them; next, not to yeeld vnto that which is euill, and contrarie to vertue and honeſty. A thing moſt eaſie it is for the Counſellor, to comprehend the endes of honeſty and profit, if he layeth before his eyes the good and welfare of the ſtate, which is the end and ſcope whereunto all wiſedome and prudence of euery <note place="margin">The end of Counſellors wiſedome.</note>Counſellor ought be referred; becauſe neyther God, the people, his country, nor wiſedome it ſelfe, can at his hand require more, then that the commonweale may be preſerued in ſafetie and happines. And <note place="margin">The felicity of common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales.</note>euery ſtate is happy, which doth abound with all good things, and if the people therein be iuſt, temperate, valiant, free, wiſe, and therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all rich, healthy, vnited and voyde of factions. The office of a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator is alſo, not onely to take care of thoſe things which tend to the felicity of the commonweale, but he ought be much more carefull to know by what meanes it may be therin continued and preſerued. For it oftimes happeneth, that by negligence of magiſtrates, the ſubiects (as each man is by nature proane rather to euill then good) by little and little doe decline from vertue, infecting the ſtate with diuers miſchiefes, wherin the commonweale muſt of neceſſity be drowned. For preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Law the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruer of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</note>wherof, it behoueth, thoſe euill accidents to be met with and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by law. For the nature of law in all commonweales is a bond to tye each man to his duty, and defend them in vertue and fidelity. But it ſufficeth not onely to make lawes, wherby men are rewarded <note place="margin">What is to be conſidered in making of lawes.</note>or puniſhed according to their merrits: but it behoueth (as the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi> did) to preſcribe examples, cuſtomes, and exerciſes of vertue, wherin the people may take delight. Therunto ciuill diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline is to be added: which both in time of peace &amp; warre ſhall make men apt and obedient to all exerciſes of vertue.

He ought ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be informed, what life euerie notable ſubiect leadeth, how he is affected to the ſtate, whether he obeyeth the lawes or be enclined to faction, whether the magiſtrates be faithfull and diligent in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique affaires, whether they be couetous, cruell and vnmercifull, or whether they be iuſt, gentle and pitifull. Alſo whether the Iudge be wiſe and learned in the ciuill ordinances, and whether they determine accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to lawe, or their owne pleaſure. Let him alſo ſo well compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in mind the whole commonweale, as to know all rightes, liberties &amp; lawes belonging to the people, &amp; as <hi>(Cicero</hi> doth counſel) what mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition <note place="margin">Knowledges neceſſary in Counſellors</note>the ſtate hath, what ſoldiers, what treſure, what confederats, what friendes, what ſtipendaries, and by what lawe, condition or compact euery of them is bound: he muſt alſo be perfect in the cuſtome of iudgements, and the preſidents of times paſt. All theſe things it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth a Counſellor to know, and continually to thinke of them, for he is the man at whoſe hand the people and countrie doe looke for their welfare: and he fayling of his endeuor, or refuſing to worke the weldoing thereof, doth commit an error not onely reproue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but alſo impious. The chiefe duetie of our loue and fidelitie (next vnto God,) is due vnto our countrie: which who ſo loueth not, is perhaps to be holden inferior to beaſtes: many of which kinde, drawen onely with loue to their naturall ſoyle (as captiues to their countrie) doe chooſe rather to die then abandon the place wherein they had their birth and education. This loue to our country ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto high wiſedome, doth make ſuch an vniuerſall agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Loue to our country.</note>among men, as nothing can be in counſell ſaide or done offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely, vnwiſely or vniuſtly, but euery thing in the ballance of perfect iudgement equally and indifferently examined. Thus we ſee the force
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7093:45"/>
of wiſedome is great, ſith through it (as by a gate,) we paſſe vnto all the other vertues, and without it no vertue can defend it ſelfe, becauſe onely by benefit of it, we become iuſt, temperate and valiant. Alſo by it, we are inſtructed where, when, and how to vſe all other vertues.</p>
            <p>Prudence hath alſo vnder her certaine other vertues, which are as it were followers and companions, by which meane, her power becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth enlarged and ornified, which if the Counſellor doth carefully remember and diligently obſerue, he ſhall thereby in his actions and counſell gaine great praiſe and glory worthy the wiſedome of ſo great <note place="margin">Companions to Prudence.</note>a perſonage. Wherfore firſt it behoueth him to be witty, docible, of good memory, of ſound vnderſtanding, circumſpect, prouident, warie, and wilie: For theſe vertues (as <hi>Plato</hi> and the <hi>Peripatetickes</hi> affirme) are the followers and ſeruants of Prudence.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Witt.</note> Witt is a certaine naturall force, by nature incident to reaſon, hauing power to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue things proceeding from reaſon, which although many times it be not nouriſhed by induſtrie, art and memory, yet is it alone of force, and without vſe or learning, doth make many men very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. Lot the Counſellor therfore know his owne wit, and become ſharpe in the excogitation of reaſons, eloquent in delating and ornifying his ſpeach, and firme in memory. This wiſedome whereby we firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue all things, doth ſpring from the quicknes of wit, and is increaſed by memory and aptnes to learning, of which two, men are called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, and is confirmed by learning and experience. That witt is moſt laudable, which is conſtant, ſtrong, ſharpe, immutable, noble, pleaſant, gallant and liberall.</p>
            <p>The ſharpnes of witt is much ornified by docilitie and memory: by the one, we be taught to conceiue thoſe things which are laid before vs, by the other we retaine in minde whatſoeuer is eyther by our ſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, or by others vttered. In the exerciſe of thoſe things, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth a Counſellor to be moſt diligent: for not to conceiue quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and remember what hath beene ſpoken of others, is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a dull and fooliſh witt, which was the cauſe that <hi>Demostines, Alcibiades, Mithridates</hi> and diuers others moſt notable men, haue beene (as we read) in thoſe things much practiſed. Furthermore we muſt know, that as witt is the grace of euery Counſellor, ſo vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <note place="margin">Vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding</note>is the light of wit, by vertue whereof, thinking and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, we conceiue all things, or their <hi>Ideas,</hi> as well true as falſe.

For by common vnderſtanding we comprehend the knowledge of things, and through it iudge, that euery thing honeſt ought be referred to vertue, and whatſoeuer is diſhoneſt muſt be included in vice; which vnderſtanding is not diſioyned from the ſences, who are, as it were interpreters and reporters of knowledge, yet muſt we take heede not to be deceiued by ſenſuall iudgement: and therefore all feblenes, dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and inſenſibilitie ought be eſchewed. For it often happeneth that eyther by art or ſubteltie, we become ſhamefully deceiued, which error in all things (and chiefly in the knowing and iudging of good and true from bad and falſe) is to be auoyded.</p>

And as the Phiſition findeth the diſeaſe increaſing, the Captaine conceiueth the ſubtiltie of his enemies, and the ſhipma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter preuenteth the tempeſt of the ſeas: So ought the wiſe Counſellor to foreſee the perils, inclinations, chances and mutations of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale.

Notwithſtanding, for that we haue in vs a certaine ſhadow or likenes of diuinitie, it happeneth that we alſo doe coniecture and forſee things to come, which may be by two meanes: eyther by inſpiration and will of God, or by our owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inſtinct.

But if the minde of our Counſellor be holy, pure, and vndefiled with dregs or ſpot of vices, and that his bodie be an habitation of that celeſtiall ſpirit and diuine minde, abſolute and perfect, by vertue thereof he may prognoſticate and foreſee things to come, and may be called not onely prudent, wiſe or prouident, but alſo holie, diuine, godly and religious. Such men were the prophets in our law, and the <hi>Sibille</hi> and ſouthſaiers, with all thoſe (whom they ſay) were inſtructed by the Nymphes and Gods: as <hi>Tircſias, Mopſos, Amphiaraus, Calchantas.</hi> But how this celeſtiall prouidence is attained, our intent is not here to diſcourſe.

If the Pilot before the tempeſt prouide not that the ſhip may ſaile in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; when windes do rage, his prouidence proueth to no purpoſe: So the Counſellor ſhould thinke how the ſtate may be preſerued, before the ſame be hurt, offended, or aſſaulted with enemies.

carefull that whatſoeuer is determined, may before execution with great wiſedome, and found iudgement be conſidered and examined. The force of all conſultation conſiſteth in thoſe things which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">VVhereof to conſult.</note>to the common life of men and conſeruation of a commonweale. He ought not therefore to conſult of things eternall or celeſtiall, as of the world, or of things which cannot happen, or of them that doe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by nature, chance, or fortune, as of findings treaſure and ſuch like, neither ſhall he conſider of trifles, as of emptines, nor of things paſt: for what is done, cannot be againe to doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But all conſultation ſhould be of things to come, and that which may happen or not happen after this or that ſort, the reaſon whereof ſeemeth to belong vnto the profit of men. Of which things, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> rekoneth fiue kindes: Of getting money, of peace and warre, of conſeruation of our countrie, of commodities to be brought in or caried out, and making of lawes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If conſultation be for leuying money, then muſt the reuennues, cuſtoms <note place="margin">Conſultation touching mony.</note>and impoſts of ſtate be ſeene and knowen, to the ende they may be increaſed or diminiſhed. Yet vnleſſe great neceſſitie ſo requireth, the impoſts would not be inlarged. For all new impoſitions (although reaſonable) are commonly offenſiue to the ſubiects, and breede much occaſion of trouble. <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperor being perſwaded to increaſe the tributes of his people, ſaid it was the propertie of a good ſhepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard to ſhere his ſheepe, but not to fleae them. He ſhall alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade neceſſary charges of ſtate to be continued and remoue ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous expences. For the better knowing whereof, let him aſwell imitate the examples of other nations as his owne country, wherein the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of hiſtories will greatly helpe him. If conſultation be of warre <note place="margin">Conſultation of warre.</note>and peace, it is to be conſidered of what force the enemie is or may be, what kind of warre is to be made, and againſt whom. It is alſo good to know the ſtrength of neighbours, whether their force conſiſteth in footemen or horſe, whether it be equall or vnequall to ours, in what reſpect they be ſtronger or weaker, to the end that peace may be made with the ſtronger, and warre with the weaker, which thing muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with great iudgement &amp; ſound deliberation. Moreouer he ſhall conſider whether the cauſe of warre be iuſt, and whether without armes our deſire may be brought to paſſe. For a wiſe man ought to proue all meanes before he taketh armes, becauſe honeſt peace is euer to be preferred before cruell warre. Touching the defence of our <note place="margin">Conſultation of defence.</note>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:7093:49"/>
countrie, it behoueth to know how much force is required, how it is garded, and what places of ſtrength is thereto belonging. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <note place="margin">Conſultatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of marchandize</note>neceſſary to remember the order of our warre and ſeruice. But if we conſult of portage and reportage of commodities, aboue all heede is to be taken, that the commonweale may not at any time want things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and that whatſoeuer is ſuperfluous may be ſolde and caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Care muſt be likewiſe taken, that in exchanging marchandize the priſes of things may be conſidered, to the end that the ſtate be not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

In <note place="margin">Conſultation of lawes.</note>the ordaining of lawes alſo, great wiſedome is required: For in them reſteth the well doing of the whole commonweale. Therein it hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth much to vnderſtand the courſe of the ſtate, what lawes haue bene receiued, and by which of them it hath bene conſerued, and by what new ordinances it may be aſſured. Whereof may be inferred that the lawes ought be framed for the commonweale, not the commonweale for the lawes: becauſe one kind of lawes are not fit for all countries. Neither are theſe knowledges onely profitable, but it is alſo neceſſary to know all the confines of our countrie, the better to forſake thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine things which be euill and receiue the good. In co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſultation of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of moſt importance, it is many times good to vſe the aduiſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for one man foreſeeth not all, which proueth that ſaying of <hi>Homer</hi> to be true.

            <p>For of good and prudent conſultation wiſe counſell doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly proceed: which is the chiefe foundation to performe things commendable. It therefore behoueth a Counſellor to excell all others in Counſell. For Counſell is a certaine aduiſed reaſon touching the <note place="margin">Counſell.</note>doing or not doing of things propounded, which a Counſellor muſt of neceſſitie at all occaſions be readie to giue, grauely, wiſely and honeſtly. For ſith in all matters three things are required, that is counſell, reaſon and ſucceſſe, it is requiſite, that good conſultation ſhould aſwell go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore action, as good ſucceſſe follow good conſultation. And as a man fighting doth deuiſe how to hurt his enemie: ſo muſt the Counſellor in counſelling accommodate his counſell vnto the time and perſons. The
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7093:49"/>
things wherof we are to conſult (as <hi>Cicero</hi> teacheth) are of three ſortes, <note place="margin">Matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultable of three ſortes.</note>eyther we conſult of things honeſt, things profitable, are of thoſe things wherein profit and honeſtie doe contend. Theſe three being exactly knowen to a Counſellor, doe fully informe him how to giue Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell in all matters whatſoeuer. Yet is great wiſedome required in knowing what is honeſt and what is profitable, and it is a matter of no leſſe vertue to vnderſtand of two honeſt and profitable things, which is the moſt honeſt or moſt profitable. We vſe ſometimes to take counſell of the matter, the time and occaſion, wherein (as in all other things) we muſt neuer flie from honeſty or profit, for we flie that which offendeth, imbrace that is profitable, and among many euils, chooſe the leaſt. Furthermore in euerie good Counſell we ſhould reſort to that which of all other good things is the beſt, as well in the particular good of our owne life, as the publique good whereon common felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie dependeth. Herein all the originall cauſes of our cogitations and Counſels ought to conſent. For all Counſels are vaine, which tende <note place="margin">The ende of good counſel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>not vnto this ende of publique felicitie, as no winde is proſperous for him, that knoweth not in what hauen he deſireth to ariue. In ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king counſell, great wiſedome, and in giuing counſell, fidelitie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is deſired. For euill counſell is worſe in him that counſelleth, but wiſe and faithfull aduiſe, is accounted moſt commendable. Let the Senator alſo take heede leaſt in giuing counſell he attribute any thing to fortune or chance, for they doe ſeldome or neuer perfectly follow the trueth: Euen as the man is not valiant, who doth valiantly by chance or vnaduiſedly: So he that followeth fortune or hap without reaſon and iudgement, is not wiſe. The Counſell of a ſenator muſt be wiſe, <note place="margin">The qualitie of counſell.</note>good, faithfull, mature, deliberate, and free: not fooliſh, craftie, haſtie or pernicious. All craftie and audatious Counſels are in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance pleaſant, in execution hard, and in euent dangerous. Let him alſo know, that there is nothing ſo great an enemie to good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell as haſt, being alwaies followed by vile and ſhamefull repentance: <note place="margin">Haſtie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous</note>which is proued true not onely in ordinarie actions, but alſo in martiall enterpriſes. Neuertheleſſe we perſwade not our Counſellor to trifle the time, but execute ſpeedely. For celeritie tempered with wiſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, is alwaies profitable, many things there are alſo, wherein a wiſe Counſellor ſhould not intermeddle, but if he happen ſo to doe, they may not be abandoned. Therefore wee commonly ſaye,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7093:50"/>
that, aduiſe ſhould be ſlowe, but execution ſpeedie, for the end and not the beginning of euery Counſell muſt be conſidered, and all things referred to neceſſitie. Neither haue commonweales appointed meetings and aſſemblies of Counſellors for other purpoſe, then that of aged and wiſe men, all matters might be firſt pondered, and after maturelie performed. At which deliberations and conſultations of great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, we will that theſe men ſhould be preſent. For it proueth greatly expedient and profitable, that matters propounded in Counſell, ſhould be much and long conſidered, &amp; it were follie in one howre to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine matters of moſt importance.</p>
            <p>After Counſell followeth ſentence, which is nothing elſe then the <note place="margin">Sentence.</note>plaine demonſtration of a mans minde and counſell. For it behoueth in words and ſpeach to expreſſe what we haue thought, to the end we may know what lieth hid in the minde and reaſon of man. This ſecret, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to proceede of nature, that diuers men who are not wiſe, yet in vttering their ſentence and concept, doe ſeeme reddie witted, of good vnderſtanding, and ſubtill: all which giftes they commonly attaine vnto by a certaine habit of age, whereunto Prudence is an handmaid and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower. <note place="margin">Old men moſt apt to vtter ſentence.</note>Olde men are therefore moſt perfect in vttering their conceits, notwithſtanding they be vnlearned: for by vſe and experience they haue (as it were) a third eye wherewith they eaſely deſcerne the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and euents of things. As euerie man is by ſpeach diſcouered, So a Counſellor by vttering his opinion declareth how wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he ought be accounted. <hi>Socrates,</hi> vpon a time, behoulding a young man neuer before ſeene, ſaid vnto him, ſpeake, that I may know thee, as though a man ſhould ſay vnto a Counſellor, by grauity of thy ſpeach let me know thee for a good Counſellor. And we commonly ſay, ſpeach <note place="margin">The ende of ſentence.</note>is the touchſtone of mens mindes. Therefore a Counſellor ought in vttering his ſentence, employ all the force and ſtrength of minde, to ſpeake things profitable for the ſtate, which is the ende of ſentence. Some men doe vſe certaine cunning and plauſible ſpeaches ſet forth with painted words, which ſeeme more then true, yet triall ſheweth, that in them there is no ſinceritie, fidelitie, or grauitie. And indeed it is not euer neceſſarie that the Counſellor ſhould ſpeak to the wiſer ſort eloquently, nor to the fooliſh truely. Others there be ſwelling with pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie grudge, anger and hate, ſo ſoone as they haue caught occaſion to ſpeake, doe forthwith fall into blaming and ſlaundering others, hoping
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7093:50"/>
by that meanes to win good will and reputation. Which kinde of men, doe no waies profit the commonweale, but rather by hatred, diſpleaſure and diſcords hinder the ſtate. For if they were good men, in cauſes concerning their countrie, they eyther would not or ſhould not be angrie, hate or grudge at others. Some alſo being ſcarſe of counſell in pronouncing their ſentence doe follow the footeſteps of other Counſellors, ſaying after them, and therfore were among <hi>Romaines</hi> called <hi>Pedar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> they ſo doe not through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ought be allowed: for it is reaſonable and profitable for the ſtate, to imitate and follow the opinion of wiſe and good Counſellors. And ſometimes it happeneth, that all Counſellors are of one minde and meaning, which ſo being, it is better to affirme that which was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by others, then with many wordes, as it were of one effect, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the time. A Counſellor muſt alſo beware that in ſpeaking his ſentence, there appeareth in his ſpeach not ſelfe liking or oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And albeit diuerſitie of opinions, will ſometimes occaſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in Counſell, yet therein all ſlaunder, offence and other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation, (which may peruert or diſturbe the ſtate) ought be eſchewed. And in reconciling of opinions, let the greater number preuaile, for that which ſeemeth good to moſt men, muſt be thought iuſt and moſt agreeable to reaſon. The order of ſpeaking in Counſell, is <note place="margin">The order of pronouncing ſentence.</note>in diuers ſtates diuerſly vſed: for in ſome the eldeſt men do ſpeake firſt, in other the yonger Counſellors, and in ſome alſo they that are of moſt experience and wiſedome, are preferred. In that matter the cuſtome of euerie place is to be obſerued, and that order to be reputed good, iuſt, profitable, &amp; conuenient, which reaſon &amp; common vſe among men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time hath receiued. Yet doth it ſeeme beſt that the opinions of the moſt aged and experienced men ſhould be firſt hard, to the end the yonger ſort may haue the more time to deliberate of their ſpeach. Beſides that, the younger Counſellors opinion, being firſt pronouun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, doe ſometimes deuide the elder; and drawe them into ſundrie conceipts. Therefore the beſt is that euerie one ſhould ſpeake, not when he would, but when he is asked. For by ſuch meanes order ſhall be obſerued, and all occaſion of contention remoued. In ſpeaking, it is lawfull ſometimes to ſpeake doubtfully, becauſe the difficultie of the matter may excuſe the ſpeaker, alſo by the diuerſitie of other mens opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, the minde is diſtracted, not knowing to which ſide to yeeld, wher

And it is fit each man ſhould ſpeake ſworne, to the ende God may be the witnes of his minde. It importeth not much whether his ſentence be written or rehearſed in words, yet the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons written are commonly ſet downe with more diligence, chiefly if the matter requireth a long oration. His voyce would be manly, and <note place="margin">The voice of a Counſellor.</note>framed rather to grauitie then effeminacie, cleare and audible: not ſoft, nor ſo low as cannot be well heard. In concluſion, the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor ought to obſerue three things by <hi>Cicero</hi> preſcribed; that is, to be <note place="margin">Three things ſpecially to be obſerued by Counſels.</note>preſent in counſell, (for the ordinarie meeting of Counſellors doth adde thereunto a grauitie,) to ſpeake in place vnto that is asked: and in good ſort or vſe meaſure, which is, that this ſpeach be not infinite. That the Counſellor which abſenteth himſelfe is blameable, wherefore being called he muſt obey. Neither is it fit that any Counſellor, ſhould goe into forraine nations, vnleſſe he be publiquely ſent as Ambaſſadour, Gouernour, or Commaunder in warre, leaſt by ſuch abſence the commonweale be damnified. The chiefe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and ground of a Counſellors wiſedome, is, that in all his wordes and workes he performe the part of a good and iuſt man, which chieflie conſiſteth in the comlineſſe of his life. For it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not, that we be wiſe, vnleſſe we are alſo good. For prudence without iuſtice is meere ſubtiltie, and holden rather a vice then ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. By the benefit of vertue we are made good, that is iuſt, courteous and honeſt, but by wiſedome we become onely wiſe. Beſides that in reſpect of vertue we are called good,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7093:51"/>
but for wiſedome alone we are not. Therefore he is indeed (as <note place="margin">Who is a good man.</note>
               <hi>Plato</hi> alſo affirmeth) to be named a good man that embraceth the vertues, liuing accordingly, and feareth not to die for his countrie, whenſoeuer the ſame is aſſaulted or oppreſſed, and be content to ſuffer all things, rather then that the ſtate ſhould be changed: which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly brought to paſſe by men of the worſt condition. Wherefore the Senator muſt be carefull to be no leſſe good and iuſt, then prudent or wiſe. For wiſedome without iuſtice is euill, ſith of iuſtice men are called good: Some men in authoritie doe prooue themſelues eloquent <note place="margin">Abuſe of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</note>and wiſe, but therewith full of ſubtiltie and diſhoneſt ſleight. For they hauing in hand the patronage of libertie and lawe, doe in ſpeach and apparance ſeem carefull therof, but (their actions well examined) dee detect them for men vniuſt, vnworthie, and diſſembling. And being indued with a falſe kinde of wiſedome, hauing their tongues but not their mindes inſtructed, doe commonly indeuor to alter and not amend the publique pollicie. There is not in anie commonweale a worſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe then the authoritie of ſuch men. For they doe alwaies ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance perſons licentious, ſubtill, deceiptfull vniuſt, and ſeditious, and in practiſing ſubtiltie, doe ſomewhat whereby to be thought good <note place="margin">Iuſtice.</note>men. But as a man come to his perfection is of all creatures the beſt: So if he forſake iuſtice and lawe, is of all other accounted the worſt. For extirpation of which ſortes of ſubiectes, we ought pray vnto God, and euery Counſellor carefull that his life be well exerciſed and employed. But men being wiſe muſt alſo be iuſt, therefore what iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ought be in a Counſellor, we are now to diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Whoſoeuer will with an attentiue minde behold and ſearch the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of things diuine and humaine, ſhall ſee that nature hath giuen to euery thing a firme, ſtable, and conſtant courſe, which of it ſelfe cannot be changed, but by a certaine and determined way doth paſſe and returne. Firſt we behold the celeſtiall orbes, the Elements, beaſtes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> foules, and creeping creatures haue their properties, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by chance, but by ſuch naturall inſtinct, as leaue them they will not; or if they would, they cannot. What ſhould I ſay of men? doe not we ſee a certaine way to felicitie, prepared of GOD for good men, and likewiſe deſtruction made for euill men. Alſo the path which leadeth to vertue is narrowe, wrong, and hard to be diſoerned, but the waie vnto vice on the left hand
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7093:52"/>
to be large, plaine, and open to manie. But to ſpeake of the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Cities and ſtates, if their courſes of life and adminiſtration, be certaine, perfect, and abſolute of nature, that is to ſay, proceeded from God or reaſon, they doe neuer abandon them, but are of long continuance, but otherwiſe become of no force, weake and decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I ſpeake not of all. Let it ſuffice that nature hath made all things we ſee, to be good, certaine, perfect, and in all reſpects abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute: <note place="margin">Naturall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </note>which moued the <hi>Stoicks</hi> to affirme, that to liue according to nature, was the chiefe felicitie of man: for nature is in deede the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductrix</hi> and Tutreſſe of perfect life, whereby we follow and obey the Author thereof. This harmonie of nature, may righty be called Iuſtice: For this is that vertue which defendeth lawe and conſent of nature: ſith whatſoeuer conſenteth with nature is iuſt, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer diſſenteth with it, is called vniuſt. Such men then as liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to nature and in all things obey her, are of all others moſt iuſt. For it is a thing contrarie to nature to doe or thinke againſt God or man: Whereupon Iuſtice is thought to be of three kindes naturall, diuine, and humaine. The firſt foundation of Iuſtice <note place="margin">Iuſtice. of three ſortes.</note>naturall, proceedeth from nature it ſelfe, which doth informe vs what to embrace, and what to eſchue. Naturall equitie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth vs to abſtaine from iniuries, and therefore we ought to doe nothing whereby an other may be offended. By this vertue men are ſo faſt bound one vnto another, as euerie man wiſheth well to all mankinde. In that antient age, which the Poets called golden, through the benefit of Iuſtice, no deceipt, fraude, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie was knowen. Then were no ſeditions, no tumult, no hate, but beneuolence, fidelitie and loue. Then needed not they any law-maker, any iudge or pleader: For equitie and goodneſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined all things, and euery man thought his owne things to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine as much to his friends as himſelfe. By which inſtinct, we loue our parents, our children, our alliance and kindred. The Iuſtice due vnto our Parents is called pietie: with which vertue (we reade) that aboue others the daughter of <hi>Cymon</hi> was indued. For ſhe by giuing her owne milke vnto her father, (in priſon condemned to die) thereby ſaued his life, and wonne her ſelfe immortall fame. This propertie alſo is with men common to other creatures, that euery kind do naturally conſpire to defend themſelues. Iuſtice doth alſo require at
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7093:52"/>
our hand, that ech man ſhould nouriſh, defend and gouerne himſelfe: for he that by wilfull hunger, negligence, or death, is diſtroyed, ought be iudged iniuſt and an enemie to nature. We are alſo bound by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to relieue our friends with our goods, and by generation of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to continue a poſteritie. In fine, thoſe that obey nature, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted iuſt, and thoſe that do thecontrarie, are iudged vniuſt: for nature <note place="margin">Iuſtice natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note>abhorreth euill, and embraceth that which is good. <hi>Socrates,</hi> and his ſchollers, defined this naturall Iuſtice, ſaying it was the ſcience of good and euill according to nature: which if a man doth exerciſe alone, (fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing nature as guide) he ought be called a good man: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating it with others, deſerueth the name of a good Citizen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then he is not onely profitable for himſelfe, but others alſo. To be iuſt after this manner, in liuing according to nature, doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly become a Counſellor, but alſo euery other man. Moreouer, they that by nature are indued with more ſinguler gifts, ought to be aboue others moſt iuſt. And therefore ſith nature hath aduanced a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor before other men, it behoueth him to excell in Iuſtice, for being inferiour herin, is reputed diſhonorable &amp; ignominious. Theſe are thoſe things which in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation &amp; maners of men ought tobe obſerued.</p>
            <p>That Iuſtice which belongeth vnto God, and whereby we are by <note place="margin">Iuſtice diuine</note>nature bound to acknowledge, worſhip, reuerence, loue and honour him, is onely proper to men. And it hath pleaſed nature, the mother of all things, that in the minde of man onely the knowledge of God ſhould be impreſſed: leauing all other creatures to eate, feede, and pamper their bodies. Man onely is that creature among enumerable others, to whom the honour, reuerence, ad worſhip of God is committed. No people therefore inhabiting the circle of the earth, but honoureth ſome God: which they thinke a thing honeſt, iuſt and neceſſarie. The ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of God and men is by a certaine naturall neceſſitie and beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence conioyned, and cannot be broken, as though men were borne of God, and therefore him they worſhip and reuerence as a father. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth that the honour giuen to God, ſhould be moſt pure, moſt holy and full of pietie, that is, we ſhould honour him with a chaſt, intire, and <note place="margin">What teligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is.</note>incorrupt minde. All the ſubſtance and force of holines and pietie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in religion: which is a vertue conteyning the knowledge how God ſhould be honoured. By it we are alſo enformed how to render vnto him thanks with true honour and holy minde. Hereof men are
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7093:53"/>
called religious and holy, becauſe they loue, and (as it were) binde themſelues to do deuine honour. God fauoureth pietie and faith, and in reſpect of them extolleth kingdomes. All things doe proſper with thoſe that obey God, and euerie thing decayeth in the handes of others, that honour him not. Moreouer, religion is of ſuch force, as through it, men are indued with all vertues, and in retaining them, are made no leſſe conſtant then religious. In him that honoureth God, there groweth a conſtant, true and inuentable hermonie of vertues: For whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doth honour him religiouſly, is prudent, and temperate, which ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are ſo tyed vnto religion, as by no poſſible meanes they may be ſundered. A conſtant religion doth worke a firme continuance of lawes, cuſtomes, vertues, and commonweale it ſelfe. It behooueth our Counſellor therefore, to haue no wauering or mutable, but a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and certaine beliefe of God and religion, for that is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his wiſedom, vertue, and dignitie. Neither ſhould any Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor be admitted to counſell, whoſe religion is inconſtant or vnſetled. For in counſell nothing ought be done contrarie to religion, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt God: but euerie thing performed with conſtancie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſynceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, holineſſe, and religious meaning. Therefore a Senate is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſacred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe all things in it done, are reputed holy: not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among men, but before God alſo. The place alſo wherein the Senate doth aſſemble, is accounted holy: ſith euerie Senator ought (with reuerence,) to lay a ſide all vnlawſull counſels and euill cogitations. The <hi>Romanes</hi> going to Counſell offered Franken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to that God in whoſe temple the Senate was aſſembled. But the Chriſtians ought obſerue other cuſtomes, for all their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſupplications, ſhould be to obtaine grace and goodneſſe from the almightie God, becauſe their praiers onely are holy, and religious. Thus it appeareth, that falſe or vnſetled religion in Counſellors, is not onely accounted euill and vnworthie but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <note place="margin">Ciuil Iuſtice.</note>impious and wicked. But of diuine Iuſtice, let this we haue ſaid, ſuffice.</p>
            <p>The knowledge of humaine iuſtice, which is alſo called ciuile, is a thing ſecrete and hidden. For albeit hath originall from natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Iuſtice, and therefore the precepts and vſe of it ſeemeth eaſie and common: yet is it not truely conceiued or exerciſed but of ſuch men, as are eyther indued with ſome diuine nature, or that haue bene employed in all kindes of vertue and good ſtudies. For
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7093:53"/>
that Iuſtice requireth a learned and wiſe man, who endeuoureth himſelfe therein, not caſually, or againſt his will, but aduiſedly, reaſonably, conſtantly and willingly. Such a one we will our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors ſhould be, poſſeſſed with ſo noble and experienced a iudgement.</p>
            <p>All force and vſe of ciuill iuſtice conſiſteth partly in the preſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſocietie among men, and is partly exerciſed in court and place of iudgement. And there is no vertue more fit or profitable, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh, conſerue, or amende the Senate, then this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All other vertues are referred to their particuler endes, and may be well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out man exerciſed: but Iuſtice reſteth in the tuition of mans ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, which is the cauſe we call it Reconciler and conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of mankinde. This vertue alloweth of no foule, cruell, barbarous, or vnſeemely thing, but embraceth things honeſt, quiet, and peaceable, caring for nothing more, then that men ſhould liue together louingly, free from iniuries, ſeditions, hate, and enmitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not deſiring the goods of others, but giuing to euerie one that which to him appertaineth. With this vertue, we will that our Counſellor ſhould be indued, for thereby he becommeth the defender of common profit, the protector of innocents, weake and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons, a repreſſor of proude men, a louer of the good, an <note place="margin">The office of a iuſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor.</note>obſeruer of trueth, an enemie to euill men, and ſo to vice. The foundation of this vertue is fidelitie, which <hi>(Cicero</hi> defineth it) to be a conſtant and true performing of more and promiſe. A iuſt Counſellor therefore doth affirme things true, not doubtfull, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth his promiſes, ſtandeth to compactes, reſtoreth what he bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth, and to the performing his faith is not compelled by lawe, by witneſſe, or oath, but by his owne willing conſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> freewill and word, which he accounteth as a lawe. Moreouer, being called from the priuate life to gouerne in ſtate, he laboureth by counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, caring and prouiding that iniuſtice be kept vnder; and that by the ſtronger, the weaker ſort be not oppreſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euer eſchewing the deſire of riches. Whatſoeuer ought be giuen for vertue, or well deſeruing, he beſtoweth vpon honeſt and well deſeruing ſubiectes.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, he iudgeth valiant men worthie to be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſlouthfull ſubiectes to be puniſhed. For by theſe two, paines and preferment, the welfare of euerie common weale is preſerued. In the beſtowing of offices, he declareth himſelfe vpright<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:7093:54"/>
reputing thoſe worthie of moſt honour, that are men of moſt merit. And in euery ſtate I thinke it fit, that care ſhould be had of the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution <note place="margin">To whom ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ought be giuen.</note>of offices: becauſe honour is the reward of vertue, and euery good man accounteth it the fruite of his labour, and ſeruice. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought that ſtate be commended, where offices and honours are giuen without reſpect, aſwell to the euill, as the good, the fooles as the wiſe men. It ought therefore be prouided by lawe, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours may be made due to thoſe, whoſe vertue and induſtrie is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by good men. In the commonweales of ancient time, Images of metall, arches tryumphall, publique ſepulture, open praiſe, and ſuch like honours were giuen to men of ſeruice and good deſeruing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In company and conuerſation, regard muſt be had to each mans age, degree, and condition: and diligent conſideration, what is in euery man of neceſſitie, vertue, or vſe. We account thoſe moſt worthy honour, who are men well borne, vertuous, in authoritie, and rich: becauſe they are moſt profitable for other men and the ſtate alſo. We likewiſe vſe to honour &amp; reuerence our elders, by bowing our bodies &amp; giuing them place. Moreouer, for ſo much as the good in men, is of three ſortes, that is, goods of the minde, of the bodie, and of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, they are all in the beſtowing of honours to be iuſtly reſpected. Therefore the goods of minde muſt be preferred, next vnto them the goods of body, and laſt the goods of fortune ought be regarded. To euery of theſe ſomewhat belongeth, according to the worthines <note place="margin">Equality to be obſerued in the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing of honor.</note>thereof and each man ought to haue his right and honour due. All theſe things a Counſellor ought to know, and in beſtowing offices, honours and gifts obſerue equalitie; for that is the ballance of iuſtice wherewith each mans manners, vertues, and actions, are waied and examined. In which, heede muſt be taken, that by ouermuch leaning towards one ſide, we ſeeme vnequall iudges aud eſteemers of other mens vertue. For he that giueth ouermuch to him that deſerueth it not, doth giueto little vnto him that is of better deſart, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no rightfull or iuſt iudge. Whereupon, this iuſtice is defined by the Philoſophers, to be an habit of the minde deſtined to common v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitie, giuing to euerie man the honour he deſerueth. Among the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which chalenge intereſt in the conuerſation of humaine ſocietie, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie is not the laſt, beingthe handmaiden, ſeruant, and follower of iuſtice: becauſe it doth not (as men ſay) remoue one hai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

from her. This equalitie in iuſt pondering and eſteeming things and <note place="margin">Equalitie of two ſortes.</note>perſons, vſeth a double manner of proceeding: the one ordinarie and common, iudging by number, waight, and meaſure: the other more difficile and ſecret, that is, waying euery thing by reaſon and iudgement. Which knowledge is onely vnderſtood of wiſe men, and thoſe that are practiſed in great affaires: and the other chiefly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to ſuch as are occupied in barrating buying and ſelling. Let the Counſellor therefore haue the skill of that equalitie which proceedeth from reaſon and iudgement, whereby he may conceiue what is due to each man, what honours ſhould be giuen, what giftes beſtowed, what offices dſtributed, what is iuſt, indifferent, good and wiſe, in all things, in all perſons, and in all places. This equalitie is aſſuredly a notable thing, and for the ſeruice of euerie ſtate, exceeding neceſſarie. And in deed we ſee many therein dull and incapable, whereby matters are handled at all aduentures and contentiouſly, greatly diſturbing not onely the ſocietie of men, but the commonweales alſo. Thus much we hope ſhall ſuffice, to haue beene ſaid of Iuſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in vſe, ſocietie, and conuerſation of men; not intermedling with courts of Iudiciall ſeats.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Fortaine Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</note> An other kinde of Iuſtice there is, not farre vnlike to this, and that concerneth iudgement: the foundation whereof is lawe and the iudgement of wiſe and iuſt men. Before ſuch time (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid) that the skill of written lawes was inuented, each man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a lawe vnto himſelfe, and ſought not the ſame in the books of lawmakers or Doctors. For in thoſe moſt ancient times, that chaſt and pure virgin (Iuſtice I meane) had her habitation within the mindes of men, giuing them lawes and precepts how to liue iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and vprightly: for ſhe being preſent, ſuffered not among men any thing to be done, vniuſtly, deceitfully, or wickedly. But ſo ſoone as men grewe wearie of iuſtice, beginning by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to couet other mens goods, offer iniuries, and take ouermuch to themſelues, not reſtoring that they borrowed: forthwith aroſe hate, diſſimulations, enemities and warre: and thereupon martiall inſtruments were deuiſed, hauing in them ſo great furie as might force not onely iuſtice, but <hi>Iupiter</hi> himſelfe to giue place. Iuſtice with feare of theſe terrors driuen away) left the earth to be gouerned by
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7093:55"/>
humaine licentiouſnes, and fled to heauen, making her houſe of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation there betwixt <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Libra</hi> the celeſtiall ſignes. Euer ſince which time thoſe that deſired to gouerne iuſtly, were forced to looke <note place="margin">Iuſtice to be ſought in heauen.</note>for wiſedome from heauen, becauſe the precepts of true iuſtice, defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with our vices, cannot without the ſpeciall grace of God be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. <hi>Homer</hi> not without cauſe, was wont to call kings and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers inſpired with the wiſedome of gouerning, Sonnes of <hi>Iupiter.</hi> Therefore this gift of diuine iuſtice muſt be deſired of God, that through the precepts and lawes therof, men may be reduced to their ancient and golden perfection, and ſuch effect be wrought in the tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mans ſocietie and in gouernment of commonweales, as in olde time that celeſtiall and incorrupt virgin (during her preſence on earth) was wont to performe. Wherby we may ſuppoſe to haue called her from heauen to dwell with vs againe vpon the earth. And ſith reaſon cannot preuaile in vs ſo much, as thereby to liue iuſtly, godly, &amp; holily, by Iuſtice it muſt be obtained, ſith ſhe by her lawes forewarneth, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and correcteth vs, preparing rewardes of vertue for the good, and <note place="margin">VVhat is Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</note>puniſhment for the euill. This iuſtice, (as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpianus</hi> teacheth) is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and perpetuall deſire to giue vnto euerie man, that which to him belongeth. The ordaining of lawes is proper to Counſellors, becauſe they are of all other men, accounted the wiſeſt, and ſo the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians, Romaines,</hi> and other people haue euer thought them. Alſo in the making of lawes, theſe things (as <hi>Plato</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) ought be obſerued, that is, the law-makers ſhould write them with a certaine fatherly loue, and no Lordly intent or tyrannicall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, framing them to the terror of others, and with threatnings cauſe them be proclaimed to the people, themſelues neither obeying, nor regarding any order or lawe at all, but practiſe the common ſpeach. <hi>Sic volo, ſic <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The intent of euerie law-maker is, that by the lawes men may be made good and happie, and that offendours ſhould be puniſhed rather for neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, than ſet purpoſe. For which cauſe the Emperour <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> deuided the commaundements of lawe into three. To liue honeſtly, <note place="margin">Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth three things.</note>to hurt no man, and giue to euerie one that which was his owne. And ſith lawes doe proceede from true reaſon, it muſt needs be,

that they doe onely reſpect vertue, and from it diſſent nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are (as it were) rules of honeſtie, reaſon, nature, and good life. Who ſo therefore doth abandon lawes, is wicked: and to contemne them is no leſſe euill, then to diſpiſe nature, God, vertue and reaſon. <hi>Heràclitus</hi> the <hi>Epheſian</hi> was wont to ſay, that free men ought as manfully to defend the lawes, as the walles of their Citie, for without walles a Citie might be preſerued, but without lawes it cannot. In all commonweales therefore the lawes ought be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, and from them the rules of life, good cuſtomes, and of all things to be done or not none, muſt be taken. <hi>Licurgus</hi> and <hi>So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> are commended for making ſuch lawes as preſcribed not onely what was preſently to be done; but alſo what was after to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed. Which our Counſellor muſt conſider, and doe to the end he may know by whatmeanes and exerciſes men be made good, and what is the ende of perfect life in euery commonweale. By this meane each man will apply his minde to ſuch ſtudies, as be agreeable to his owne nature, thinking it praiſable to excell, and for excellent men the rewardes of vertue be prepared. And in trueth there is nothing ſo hard which men leaue vnattempted if great giftes and rewardes be thereunto due. Which onely thing doth remooue and driue away all ſlouth and idle life, the mother of euery vice. For by idlenes we ſee the mindes of men to growe wanton and periſh, and as <hi>Cato</hi> ſaid truely, by nothing doing, the people did learne how to doe euill. <hi>Diodorus</hi> writeth of a certaine lawe among the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi>

By which meanes, the commonweale ſhalbe furniſhed with ſubiectes, aſwell for warre as peace, and by their vertue, ſeruices both diuine and humaine may be performed, the countrie from inuaſion defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <note place="margin">Change of lawes dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</note>and the bonds thereof enlarged.

And as the nature of people is alwaies apt to innouation, ſo ſoone as one lawe is altered, forthwith they deſire the alteration and ſubuertion of all the reſt. Which thing breedeth not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of lawes, but alſo ſedition, and mutation of the ſtate. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient lawes therfore ought be obſerued, and ſometimes wiſely correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and reformed. For euery mutation in the commonweale, (be <note place="margin">The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Locrenſi a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the change of lawes.</note>it neuer ſo ſmall) is a thing moſt perilous. Among the <hi>Locreuſes</hi> it was prouided, that if any man did inuent a newe lawe, he ſhould firſt propound the ſame to the people, wearing a halter about his necke, to the ende that if it were thought pernitious or vnprofitable, as an author of euill, he might forthwith be hanged. <hi>Periander</hi> was wont to ſay, that olde lawes ought be obſerued, and they being growne <note place="margin">The princes life a lawe to the people.</note>from vſe, newe might be receiued. It doth alſo greatly profit the ſtate, that princes and others hauing authoritie to ordaine lawes ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well obſerue them in their owne perſons as compell them to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by others. For there is nothing which ſubiects ſo much behold as their Prince, whoſe life is looked vpon and followed as a lawe. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus</hi> made a lawe, that whoſoeuer were token in adultrie ſhould looſe both his eies. Afterwardes his owne ſonne being found in that fault, was deſired by all his ſubiects to pardon him: but that ſuite preuailed not otherwiſe then that firſt he cauſed one of his ſonnes, an other of his owne eies, to be taken out, to the ende the ſeueritie and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of lawe might be obſerued, and that the force thereof might be <note place="margin">Lawes are made for two endes.</note>more regarded then the authoritie of men. The endes why lawes be ordained in euerie ſtate are two, the one that Iuſtice may be entred into men, the other to continue it in them. The firſt appertaineth to the lawmaker, who frameth the people fit for vertue, the ſecond belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the Iudge, for he repreſſeth the deſires of offenders, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth all the right appertaining to the commonweale. The Iudge (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thinketh) ought from the lawmakers to receiue the lawes whereupon he ſhould giue iudgement. Firſt for that it is intended
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7093:56"/>
one law-maker is of more wiſedome, then many iudges. And next becauſe he foreſeeing things to come, doth determine without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation. Which the Iudge doth not, being ſubiect to affection, in that he dealeth with things preſent and iudgeth of perſons certaine. Euen as to make good lawes and obſerue them, is profitable for the ſtate, ſo to determine and end contentions by lawe, is thought a thing commendable. Among men ſometimes contention of doubtfull matters doth ariſe, whereof it behoueth the iudge to determine. The Iudge therefore is no leſſe neceſſarie to compound controuerſies in the commonweale and adminiſter iuſtice, then is the ſoule in a liuing bodie. For being indifferent to both parties, he reduceth that to equalitie which he thinketh vnequall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not vnlike vnto a line cut into vnequall partes, that part which is to long is cut ſhorter and added to the other: So doth the Iudge being the liuing lawe, and as it were an Oracle in the commonweale. The Iudge ought alſo to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count himſelfe an interpreter to law-makers, a miniſter of iuſtice &amp; his chiefe vertue muſt be to know what is iuſt and true. He ought ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to ſwerue from lawe and the meaning therof, but giue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the lawes, equitie, and iuſtice doth commaund: For which reſpect it behoueth him to be ſworne, to the end God may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to witneſſe his intent and conſcience, which of all other things God hath made in man moſt diuine. Let the Iudge likewiſe be free from ire and all ſuſpition of hope, loue, and hatred, not corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">Qualities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a Iudge.</note>with giftes, not fearefull of threats, nor by flatterie abuſed or ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. For where iudges are ſubiect to theſe paſſions, Iuſtice is farre remoued both from the iudiciall ſeate, and the Iudge himſelfe: and there is nothing that infecteth the commonweale more with ſeditions, hate, and iniuries, then the corruption and iniuſtice of iudges.

In like manner ought our Counſellor, to take heed that his iuſtice (which extendeth to all ſorts of people) may be moſt duetifull, and that both in making and executing of lawes, he may declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a man of ſinguler iuſtice, for it were ſhame to him not to obſerue lawes, who is the executor and maker of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: he commaundeth others, and the lawe commaundeth him: not that lawe onely which is written in bookes and tables of braſſe, but the liuing lawe of reaſon which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in our mindes. <hi>Solon</hi> being asked how the commonweale might be preſerued, anſwered, if the people obey the magiſtrates, and the magiſtrates obey the lawe. <hi>Bias</hi> alſo ſaid, that commonweale might be beſt aſſured, where all men feared the lawes, no leſſe then a Tyrant. It were a thing moſt inconuenient in all ſtates, that the lawes ſhould be reputed like the ſpiders webbe, to take hold of the weake or ſimple, and ſuffer the ſtrong and mightie to paſſe. Of which errour our Counſellor ſhall be heedfull, indeuouring himſelfe to loue, obſerue and continually be carefull howe the lawes may in violablely be preſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued.</p>

               <note place="margin">The office of a Counſellor.</note> For it is the true office of a Counſellor to know the lawes, and honour iuſtice: yetdo we remember him, in the execution of lawe, to auoid ouer much ſeueritie &amp; crueltie.

Crueltie is proper to tyrants &amp; barbarous people, neither is there any vice in the commonweale more vile, cruell, and deſtable. Let the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor be neither extreame, nor ouer pitifull, ſo as in puniſhing, the puniſhment ſhall not be greater then the offence.

Albeit that Iuſtice in ayding the ſocietie of men doth imploy the ſeruice of all other vertues, and is therefore called their Queene: Yet hath ſhe her peculiar companions, handmaidens, and followers, which are not ſo common to all other vertues.

            </p>
            <p>Through pietie we gaine the good will not onely of God but men alſo, by it we are counſelled to imagine no vaine, fooliſh, or deceipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing, thereby our words and actions doe purchaſe credit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the godly man is accounted in the fauour of God, and by his counſell to be gouerned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> to gaine himſelfe credit in the religion which he deuiſed for the <hi>Romaines</hi> (diſſembling pietie) brought them in beliefe, that he with his wife <hi>Aegeria</hi> vſed to meete the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gods in a certane place ſacrificed to <hi>Camena,</hi> and there receaued the lawes and religion, which the <hi>Romaines</hi> were to liue in. They ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who neither by perſwaſion nor force could be reduced to religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by colour of pietie were drawen to be moſt religious. That re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (though fained) was profitable for the <hi>Romaines:</hi> but howe much more profitable ſhall the ſame be in our Counſellor whoſe religion is true, holy &amp; ſincere? What rights what ceremonies, and what workes of pietie ought be in a Senator, is not in this place to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed. It ſufficeth (I thinke) that each man is inſtructed in the rules of true religion, whereof we haue ſaid ſomewhat in our treatie of diuine iuſtice. In the obſeruation of pietie, two things are chiefly <note place="margin">VVhat to be eſchewed in Pietie.</note>to be eſchewed, that is, hereſie, and ſuperſtition: which vices doe many times in weake mindes peruert true pietie. We owe alſo a certaine pietie to our parents which is performed by loue &amp; reuerence. For to them we are bound to to do all honour, ſeruice, &amp; duetie: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aged, (if need ſo requireth) we ought with our owne hands to helpe them, and defend them from all miſaduentures, Goodnes requireth we ſhould be good, which is to performe the actions of vertue. Our Senator <note place="margin">Goodnes.</note>therefore ſhalbe a iuſt and goodman, and attaine to ſuch perfection of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7093:58"/>
minde, as he will not onely refraine euill doing, but alſo though he would doe euill, yet he could not: ſo as, the prouerbe of countrie people which <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaketh of, may be in him verified. Where it behoueth that in all his actions he doe follow vertue as a Captaine, which doing, he ſhall rightly performe all things belonging to the duty <note place="margin">Innocencie.</note>of an honeſt iuſt man. For nothing, reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth a Counſellormore then innocencie of life, ſeeing thereby he ſhalbe euill willed of no man, feare no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, norbe enemie to no man, but liue happy, without ſuſpicion, feare, force, and ſubtiltie; ſyncere, perfect, true and without reproach. Of the innocencie required in a Counſellor this is the foundation: to do good to all he is able, and to hurt no man. This vertue Ioueth ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie, conioyned with prudence, allowing of nothing that is clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, diſſembled, fayned or ſhadowed: therefore ſycophants, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, lyars, talebearers, and ſlaunderers muſt be excluded from the number of Senators. It behoueth him in all his actions to deale libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally: For diſſimulation is a ſeruile thing. As he is not rightly called innocent that hurteth a little, but he that offendeth not at all: ſo is he to be accounted no diſſembler, that in deed is voide of all diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And like as no man entered the temple of <hi>Ceres Elucina</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he were innocent: being written vppon the doore: Let no man enter, but he that knoweth his owne innocencie; ſo into the holy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, which is temple of Iuſtice and trueth, I wiſh that onely Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors innocent, and men of integritie ſhould come. Let the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors mind be open and ſincere, not hidden, obſcure, or deceiptfull, ſaying one thing and meaning another: but his tongue muſt be a true interpreter of his minde, and his face, countenance and eyes free from diſguiſing, and full of naturall ſinceritie: for ſuch cuſtomes be common to light perſons, and barbarous people, who know not how to be good men, but abuſe both the office &amp; name of men, &amp; therfore to them either little or no credit ought to be giuen. Our Senator therfore ſhall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſalow theſe vices, but alſo contemne all thoſe that allow them, reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting them from his preſence &amp; companie, not hauing to do eyther pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately or publiquely with any light, vaine or babling companion. Our Counſellor ſhalbe alſo courteous to the good; for courteſie, &amp; affable <note place="margin">Courteſie.</note>ſpeach do greatly win the good will of all men. Let him the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be willing to anſwer, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented to heare, auoiding all ſowernes, &amp; inſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy in words, geſture &amp; motion.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7093:58"/>
moderately, or ſeldome vſing vaine ſports and youthfull paſtimes. For ſpeach not merry but graue, not ſubtle but true, not ridiculous but conſtant, becommeth a Counſellor. Vnto courteſie, grauetie beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a Counſellor, ought be ioyned, yet ſuch as containeth no pride, diſdaine, or inſolency, but that which is modeſt, milde, and gentle. Alſo for that kindneſſe or benignitie is neceſſarie to lead an honeſt life, <note place="margin">Benignitie;</note>the example of god doth ſhew, that through his benignitie we are iuſt &amp; happie. For as God is to vs kinde, ſo ought we be gentle &amp; courteous to others: becauſe man ſhould be (as is commonly ſaid) a God vnto man. Gentlenes, priuately containeth in it humilitie, temperatenes, mildnes, and a certaine ſweetnes of manners and ſpeach: and publiquely it hath clemency and moderation. Wherefore it ſhall become the counſellor in conuerſation to be gentle, courteous and ſweet: not ſowre, auſteare and (as <hi>Timon</hi> was) a hater of men. Let him therefore diſpoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to loue others, profit, and helpe them. For as we owe vnto God religion and pietie, ſo is loue and beneuolence due vnto men. Clemencie belongeth onely to magiſtrates and men in authoritie, for <note place="margin">Clemencie.</note>by force thereof their diſpleaſure towards offendours becommeth qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified. The oppoſit to this vertue, is cruelty and bitter extreamitie in puniſhing, a thing proper to Tyrants, and men void of all humanitie. <hi>Draco</hi> was ſo cruell, as by his lawes he ordained the puniſhment of death to be due aſwell for idle life, as murther: And being asked for what cauſe he made the penaltie of the leaſte offences, to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with the greateſt: anſwered, that he thought ſo great a paine due vnto the leaſt faults, and for the greateſt he could not deuiſe any great enough. But with much more clemencie <hi>Scipio</hi> was wont to ſay, he had rather ſaue the life of one Citizen, then ſlea a thouſand enemies. There is no vertue that maketh men ſo much loued as clemencie, and chiefly thoſe that haue authority: For that vertue is moſt noted, which is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with authoritie, and it is a thing againſt nature for great men to hurt others. It is therefore no leſſe reprochfull in magiſtrates to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon puniſhers, then for phiſitions to to bury many patients. Alſo the gouernours clemency, doth breed in men a baſhfulnes and feare to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend. Yet do I thinke that clemency and mildnes are ſo to be vſed that ſeueritie (at occaſion) be not neglected. For without it no common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale can be well gouerned. To ouermuch clemency there belongeth a certaine ſuperfluous pitie conceiued of the aduerſitie of others: which
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7093:59"/>
the <hi>Stoicks</hi> would euerie wiſe man ſhould want, ſaying it is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of a baſe minde yeelding to the nature of other mens of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences: and therefore ſuch may be reſembled to fooliſh women that would haue theeues deliuered, becauſe they ſee them ſhed teares in priſon. Moreouer the <hi>Stoicks</hi> affirme, that mercy ought to reſpect the cauſe, and not the fortune wherein clemency is vſed, for that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of reaſon, the other ſhould be eſchewed. But omitting their opinions, we will that our Senator ſhalbe indued with clemency &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, imploying them in all things that are honeſt and iuſt.</p>

Alſo whatſoeuer nature hath made for the commoditie of man, It willeth that the ſame ſhould be common for all men, yet not ſo, that each man ſhould haue therein property, but that by imparting, giuing, and lending, it ſhould (ſo much as reaſon requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth) be made common: Of which coniunction of mindes, neceſſities, amities, and inward good will ſhould grow. This vertue whereby we are perſwaded to giue and ſupply the neceſſities of other men, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led liberalitie, becauſe it is a thing worthy a free man, and requireth a free minde. But for that there are diuerſe degrees of mens ſocietie, whereof ſome ought be preſerued before others, the offices of liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">In what ſort to be liberall.</note>ſhalbe obſerued, if we become moſt liberall, and beneficiall to thoſe that are to vs neareſt and moſt deare: wherein the order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to be followed, preferring our parents, children, and kindred <note place="margin">VVhat to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew in libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie.</note>before others, and our friendes, before men vnknowne. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe our countreymen before ſtrangers. In liberalitie heede muſt be taken, that we giue not more then our powre ſuffereth, nor leſſe then the office of dignitie and humanitie requireth. For thoſe that haue no ſtaie in giuing, are prodigall; and they that giue nothing, be called ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly and miſerable, which vices, who ſo deſireth to eſchew (for all vices are indeed to be eſchewed) let him looke to whom he giueth, when, how, what, in what place and time. For to giue vnto him that hath inough, (vnleſſe ye beleeue he needeth more then he hath, or doe it to ſhew magnificence) by ſo doing, liberalitie is abuſed. We muſt therefore know, what is fit to be giuen to each man, for it were vnfit to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7093:59"/>
giue a targat vnto a prieſt, a booke to a ſoldier, a gowne to a plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. We ought therefore to giue, firſt things neceſſary, then things profitable, and laſtly things pleaſant and durable. For neceſſitie &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit are the cauſes of giuing. In giuing chiefe reſpect muſt be had to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie, to the ende we abuſe not the office of liberalitie, by giuing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill things, or to euill perſons: For benefits euill beſtowed, are (as <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> thinketh) reputed euill deeds: ſith (as men commonly ſay) he that giueth to a perſon worthy, receiueth a benefit. Some men become li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall moued thereto by a certaine furie of minde: whoſe gifts doe merit no praiſe, becauſe they are not giuen as they ought be, deliberatly, and with iudgement: Such gifts are commonly beſtowed by vaine and vnaduiſed perſons. Theſe cuſtomes are therefore to be eſchew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in liberalitie, and the other to be obſerued. There is no vertue that winneth the good will of men more then this: For through it we relieue others, and make proofe of our owne liberall, iuſt and well diſpoſed minde. To be liberall, what is it elſe, then to imitate God? For as he is liberall towards vs, ſo we ſhould be liberall to others. We muſt moreouer be warie leaſt our liberall deeds be not performed with the ſpoyle of other men, for that libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie <note place="margin">VVhereof to be liberall.</note>which is done to harme other is greatly vniuſt. We muſt therfore giue of ſuch goods which are iuſtly gotten by our owne or others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie: and chiefly to thoſe, that by our giuing ſhalbe the better, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſtudie of liberall ſciences or in the diſcipline of warre, which are things moſt profitable to commonweale. Among many errors which men commit, thoſe are moſt perilous, whereby we are ſo blinded, as we neither know how to giue, no of whome to receiue a benefite.</p>
            <p>Therefore difference of men is to be made, alſo the manners &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of each man towards vs with his worthines ought to be wayed: for nothing is done liberally, but that which is done iuſtly. Neither is the office of liberalitie exerciſed only by money: for ſome are helped with the preſence of frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds; others with credit, others with fauor, others with counſell, others with authoritie, others with labour, and ſuch like: which kind of benefits are moſt honourable, &amp; fit for a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſellor: for the one, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth from the cofers of the liberall man, &amp; the other fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be exhauſted or diminiſhed. Amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g many other vertues in <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> this is not the leaſt: that he neuer returned home, but
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7093:60"/>
before his returne, he made ſome one or other man beholding vnto him. The Sonne of <hi>Titus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>espatianus</hi> was wont to ſay, that the day wherin <note place="margin">Lawes of liberalitie.</note>he beſtowed no benefit, was time vtterly loſt. It is alſo the office of a liberall man to acquite a benefit with more abundance then it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. In giuing, theſe two precepts muſt be obſerued: to forget the benefit we giue, and remember well that we haue receiued: for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of a good turne receiued, is a kinde of exprobation, and a minde vnthankefull is odious both to God and men. We muſt alſo in giuing not be miſerable, as though we were both vnwilling orſory to giue, but doe it willingly and with a franke minde, for be it money or other thing, whatſoeuer is giuen, the ſame is not to be called the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, but the ſigne of the benefactors minde: Neither ſhalt thou obſerue what, but how willingly it is giuen, for liberalitie is meaſured chieflie by the will of the giuer: and therefore a certaine man receiuing a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of an other that gaue it vnwillingly, called that gift a loafe made of <note place="margin">Magnificence</note>ſtones. Next liberalitie, Magnificence followeth, which vertue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in greate expences and giftes, differing from liberalitie in this onely, that the one is employed in ſmall and meane giftes and the other in great. Magnificent men were wont to ſhew their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in building Churches, erecting cities, townes, villages, and doing all things wherby eyther God might be honoured, or their owne good ſame encreaſed. In which actions, comelines muſt be obſerued, and reſpect muſt alſo be had to the perſon, place, time, and matter, wherein the magnificent charge is beſtowed. For it were folly for him to ſeeme <note place="margin">VVhat to be eſchewed in magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</note>magnificent, that wanteth both powre and iudgement to performe great matters. Let him alſo beware of that which is commonly ſaid, that each mans coat muſt be cut according to the qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tity of his cloath. And albeit that parcimonie is reputed a great reuenew, yet ought we not be ſo ſparing as to ſeeme void of liberalitie, couetous, miſerable, &amp; careleſſe, both of others and ourſelues, alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we muſt not only be fillers of bagges, or hoorders of coyne, as men that ſtudie more to enrich a laſciuious heire, then profit the commonweale, friendes or kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes.

In chooſing friends chiefe reſpect is to be had vnto vertue, for the nature of vertue is ſuch as vertuous men doe not onely refuſe the friendſhip of euill men, but alſo deeme them vnworthy to be looked on. Few friends are better then many: for perfect friendſhip cannot remaine in the minde of great numbers. They that are deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with familiaritie of many, are not accounted friends, but men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinable and faire conditioned: for it is one thing to be conuerſable and gentle in the entertainment of all men, and an other thing to be a friend to one whom we make a perpetuall fellow and continuall companion of our cogitations and life. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> was wont to ſay, a man ought not go from court, till ſuch time as he had wonne ſome new friend to be ioyned vnto the number of his old.

Wherefore let our Counſellor be a defendour and cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of concord: For diſcord is the poiſon of all commonweales. Seeing there was neuer any Emperour, Tyrant or gouernour that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed againſt conſent. Therfore the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> did moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly inhabit the houſe of concord, to ſhew thereby that in counſell, nothing ſhould be done ſeditiouſly or contentiouſly, but all things performed courteouſly and peaceably. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> king of <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> keing asked why <hi>Sparta</hi> was not inuironed with walles, informed the asker, that the Citizens liued vnited and armed, and ſhewing him the men ſaid, Lo, heere are the walles of <hi>Sparta. Scilurus</hi> hauing fowreſcore ſonnes before his death offered them a bondle of arrows to be broken at once: they anſwering it were a thing impoſſible: he tooke the arrowes one by one, and brake them all, thereby war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his ſonnes, to liue in concord, ſaying that by force therof they ſhould be inuincible and happy. In like manner <hi>Mycypſa</hi> king <hi>Numedy</hi> being readie to die, aſſembled his children, and admoniſhed them in any wiſe to be louers of concord, alledging the ſaying which neuer
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7093:62"/>
ought be forgotten, which is: that by concord ſmall things encreaſe, <note place="margin">Diſcord of Counſ: da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</note>but by diſcord the greateſt are conſumed. The diſcord of Senators ought aboue all to be eſchewed, leſt by ſuch example the other ſubiects be infected. It were diſhonorable for them to ſpend time in chiding, and not in counſelling, for there is nothing ſo agreeable to their calling, as loue, peace, concord, and good will: and that ſtate is in apparant pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, where the Senate is deuided. For how ſhould thoſe that contend one againſt the other conſult of peace, concord, or quietnes in the commonweale? Wherefore, eyther the contendors mindes muſt be reconciled, or without reſpect to ſay their mindes: for thoſe ought be remoued from Counſell and puniſhed, that preferre priuate hate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore publique peace and tranquillitie. In Counſell nothing ſhould be done contentiouſly, vnwillingly, or ſeditiouſly. Of concord and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice let this we haue ſaid ſuſtice.

Notwithſtanding, all men (in my opinion) be greatly deceiued, that think the life of man may be pleaſantly paſſed without the mixture of perils &amp; perturbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.

Neither can there be any taſte of vertue or happines, if without miſhaps we alwaies did liue. For ſorrowes being paſſed (like reſt after labour) do make the fruit of felicitie much more pleaſing.

               </note>other vertues. For the ſubſtance and nature of Prudence, Iuſtice, and Temperance, is of it ſelfe without fortitude ſoft, and effeminate: For the propertie of them is to thinke and doe onely; but the qualitie of this vertue is, to thinke and execute conſtantly, manfully, and valiantly. This vertue is aſſuredly moſt requirable in a Counſellor, for without it he ſhall neuer imagine nor performe any thing noble or worthie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie. <note place="margin">VVhat to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew in forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note>Yet therein we muſt take heede neither to be fooliſh, hardie, proud, raſh, timerſome, ſlouthfull, or cowardlie. Who ſo would be valiant, it behoueth him to be ſo affected, as to do all things for loue to vertue, and in attempting perils be lead by reaſon, and not by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, chance, or deſperation. All commendation due to Fortitude conſiſteth partlie in Domeſticall, and partly in Publique, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie <note place="margin">Domeſticall Fortitude.</note>actions. Domeſticall Fortitude doth ornefie the happines of life: and the qualitie thereof is to remooue all perturbation of mind, deſire, feare, ſorrow, voluptuouſnes, anger, and euery other affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: poſſeſſing our mindes with tranquillitie, conſtancy, and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe <note place="margin">Fortitude mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie.</note>of life. Fortitude militarie conſiſteth in ſuffering all labour and perill, and chiefly in diſdaining death for cauſe of honeſtie, and the quarrell of our countrey. It is therefore the office of a valiant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor not to be diſmaid in time of danger, induring and ſuffering all things which to be done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are thought honourable, and not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note>them, ſeemeth vile, and reprochfull. The chiefe properties of a greate and valiant minde, are, to feare nothing, to contemne all worldlie thinges, and be perſwaded to ſuffer whatſoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falleth.</p>
            <p>Moreouer it behoueth a Counſellor to be ſo couragiouſly affected and diſpoſed, that all his gifts of wit &amp; minde, together with his vertues be (as with a certaine ſauce) tempered with Fortitude: For as our meats
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7093:63"/>
without ſalt, ſo all vertues wanting fortitude, are iudged vnſauerie. This is that, which defendeth both bodie and minde from all furies of misfortune. This is that, which maketh vs in Prudence quiet, in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance conſtant, and in Iuſtice ſtout, valiant, and inuincible. Wee ought therefore be alwaies valiant in minde, in enterpriſes reſolute, in diſdaine magnanimious, and in ſuffering neuer diſmaid. This vertue called fortitude, wanteth not a flocke of meane vertues companions, and followers: As, magnanimitie, conſtancie, patience, confidence, <note place="margin">Followers of fortitude.</note>and ſecuritie. It is the propertie of men nobly minded, to doe and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre to thoſe things which in euery vertue are thought greateſt &amp; moſt honourable. This vertue is chiefly knowne by aſpyring to honours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it diſdaineth thoſe whome ſhe thinketh inferiours in vertue. The noble minded man aſcendeth to honour by the ſtayrs of vertue, and as it were imitating the courſe of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who of the <hi>Siracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan</hi> ſpoyles builded a temple conſecrated to honour, making the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage thereunto in ſuch ſort, that no man could enter it vnleſſe he firſt paſſe through the houſe of vertue to it adioyning: beeing perſwaded there was no way open to honour but by vertue, which the noble Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator in aſpiring and ſeeking his honour ought aſſuredly to beleeue. Moreouer, let him contemne ſmall imaginations: for to men of ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vertue, no blot or touch of infamie can be imputed. He muſt aſwell in aduerſitie as proſperous fortune beare one ſelfe ſame minde, declaring the nobilitie of his valiant, and honourable heart in great <note place="margin">The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a mag<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nanimious Counſellor.</note>and extreame dangers, and not in any wiſe to faint though death ſhould therof follow: for to ſuch men, honeſt death is the beginning of life, whereunto a valiant Counſellor muſt giue himſelfe willingly for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and immortall glories ſake. The fame of <hi>Codrus</hi> ſhall liue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, becauſe he, to ſaue his armie and countrie, ſacrificed himſelfe. Alſo the names of <hi>Curtius</hi> and <hi>Sceuola,</hi> the one caſting himſelfe hedlong into a deuouring pit to deliuer <hi>Rome</hi> from plague, the other burned of his owne hand, to make the enemies know that the <hi>Romaines</hi> were reſolute in the defence of their libertie. The memorie of valiant men is hallowed with immortall honour, and by record of all Chronacles are preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued aliue for euer. It is alſo the part of a noble Senator to iudge true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and conſtantly of all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not following the opinion of common people, who determine by chance, or as preſent occaſion requireth. He ſhal likewiſe willingly take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him the defence of trueth, and therin
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7093:64"/>
not diſſemble, proteſting himſelfe an open enemie to all euill men, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he ſometimes thinke good to diſguiſe (as wiſe men do) being therto forced by neceſſitie, reſpect of perſons and time. Let him willingly and freely beſtow his benefits, &amp; vnwillingly, baſhfully and diſcretly receiue of others following the aduiſe of <hi>Heſiodus,</hi> who willed, that a good turne receaued ſhould be reacquited with encreaſe: for he that receaueth is <note place="margin">Taxilis.</note>therein inferiour to him that giueth. <hi>Taxilis</hi> one of the <hi>Indian</hi> kinges, meeting with <hi>Alexander</hi> the great (as <hi>Plutarchus</hi> reporteth) ſaide vnto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I challenge thee, not to warre nor combat, but vnto an other kinde of contention: if thou be our inferiour receiue a benefit, or if thou be our ſuperiour, beſtow a good turne vpon vs, to whom (it is written) <hi>Alexander</hi> anſwered: thus it becommeth vs to contend, not who ſhould receaue, but who can excell &amp; ouercome an other in well deſeruing, and with thoſe words imbraced him, &amp; ſuffered him to enioy his kingdome with encreaſe. The Counſellor muſt alſo be liberall of his authority &amp; indifferent to all men, but chiefly to thoſe that be of meane fortune. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong great perſonages, he ſhalbe magnanimious &amp; high minded: for in that preſence to extoll himſelfe, and diſcretly ſpeake in his owne glory is the qualitie of a generous mind: but in companie of inferiours to do ſo, would be accounted a light part, for of the one glory, and of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">How to take quarrell.</note>hatred, groweth. In taking quarrell or offence, he ſhall attend iuſt cauſe, &amp; honeſt occaſion: therin ſhewing himſelf neither ſecret nor craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but plaine and open. For it is the propertie of a great mind to hate apparantly, &amp; without diſguiſing or diſſembling countenance to cloke diſpleaſure. The magnaminious Counſellor ſhall rather repulſe, then of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer iniurie, diſdaining thoſe wrongs that be done him, for it is the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of great ſpirits to ſet light and contemne ſmall iniuries, and a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manniſh thing it is to feare with anger, ſith ſome beaſts are ſo ſilly and of ſo ſmall force, as neither Elephant nor Lion will vouchſafe to offend them. Let our Counſellor alſo be an earneſt delighter in things honeſt, and a moderate ſeeker for profit. His life muſt be gouerned rather to his owne content, then the fancy of others, and truſt rather to <note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor no fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of each mans fancy.</note>the counſell of friends, then the examples of other men. Let him be no euill conceiuour or ſpeaker, nor willingly heare any man euil ſpoken of. Neither ſhould he be without iuſt cauſe angry or offended, for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is a ſeruile thing, as the Poet ſaith.

            <p>Some men through a haughtie and proud arrogancie haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured the brightnes of their magnanimious mindes: which are chiefly thoſe, that doe not rightly examine the duetie of their owne vertue or honour, arrogating to themſelues more then becommeth good and wiſe men: which vice our Counſellor ſhall in any wiſe eſchew: following that precept of <hi>Tullie,</hi> which ſaith, that the higher we are in authoritie, the more lowlie we ought behaue vs. For indeed arrogancy is both o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and offenſiue to all men. In like manner, lightnes, viletie, and cowardice muſt be auoided, for he that putteth vp iniuries, and for feare or want of knowledge doth beare them, doth ſeeme a ſlaue or bondman. Some there are, who being good and wiſemen, yet through faint heart and cowardice doe thinke themſelues vnfit to performe great enterprices, and ſtand in feare to take in hand the defence of their countrie and friendes. Therefore are to be reputed fooles and ſlothfull.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Conſtancie.</note> It alſo becommeth a valiant Counſellor in all ſpeeches, actions, and aduerſities (if any happen) to be conſtant: for a moueable and vnconſtant minde more mutable then <hi>Proteus,</hi> is in ſuch a man no leſſe vnſeemely then fraud or deceipt. True it is, that things are praiſable, which be taken in hand with iudgement and reaſon: notwithſtanding, if thereunto perſeuerance be not ioyned, they be accounted diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. The conſtancie of <hi>Ariſtides</hi> meriteth high commendation: for when <hi>Dioniſius</hi> deſired his daughter in mariage, he anſwered that he had rather ſee her dead, then the wife of a Tyrant: and hauing ſlaine her, was againe asked whether he continued in that minde ſaid: he was ſorie for the fact, but glad that he had ſo ſpoken. Who would not alſo admyre the conſtancie of <hi>Cato?</hi> In whom (notwithſtanding the affliction of his countrie) was neuer ſeene any alteration, but had alwaies one cheere, one countenance, aſwell being repulſed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, as when he was <hi>Pretor:</hi> continuing the ſame conſtancie in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, in counſell, in warre, in time of his death, and in that terrible feare, when the ſtate was vanquiſhed, <hi>Caeſar</hi> armed and as victorious vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the commonweale. <hi>Xantippe</hi> was wont to ſay, that <hi>Socrates</hi> her husband returned alwaies home with the ſame countenance he went
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7093:65"/>
forth: for indeed ſuch was the minde of that Philoſopher, as neither with aduerſitie or proſperitie it could be diſturbed. It behoueth vs therefore in ſuffering ſorrow and griefe to be firme and ſtable, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing all perils of bodie and cares of minde, like vnto <hi>Regulus</hi> who rather then the priſoners ſhould be reſtored, deliuered himſelfe to the <hi>Carthagenienſes.</hi> It is reported that when <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> was beaten by <hi>Nicorontus</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> he ſaid vnto him, thou maiſt for thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure perſecute and torment this bodie, but my conſtancy of minde can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">VVhat to be eſchewed in Conſtancie.</note>not be harmed. Notwithſtanding, the Counſellor ſhall aboue all things take heede not to be ouer conſtant in matters vniuſt, for conſtancy ſhould onely accompanie vertue. Moreouer to defend any conceipt obſtinately againſt reaſon and the opinion of good and wiſe men, or to perſeuere in trouble, for an vniuſt cauſe, is the qualetie not of a conſtant but a ſelfe willed ſtubborne, fooliſh, and peruerſe minde. Conſtancie is alſo required in the choiſe of mans life, for who ſo perſeuereth not in that courſe and trade he hath choſen and embraced, is thought in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things worthy to want the praiſe of conſtancy. Conſtancie is the conſeruer of all good counſels and actions: for vaine were our wiſe conſultations, if the ſame ſhould ebb and flow like the riuer of <hi>Eurip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus.</hi> Alſo great conſtancie ought be, to keepe ſecret matters of counſell, for many things there ſpoken, are neither to be told to ſtrangers nor do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall friends. It is the propertie of a light and vnconſtant head, to blab out myſteries done or ſpoken in counſell: which was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that the <hi>Romaines</hi> conſulting of great matters, would not admit the <hi>Pedarij</hi> Senators, nor any of the Clerks to be preſent, but they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues performed that office. At the beginning, the Senate houſe was open to all young men that were diſcended of the number of <hi>Patritii,</hi> til after that noble &amp; memorable part, of <hi>Papirius</hi> they were forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, leaſt through inconſtancie of youth, the ſecrets of ſtate ſhould be diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <note place="margin">Papyrius.</note>and thereby the commonweale damnified. <hi>Papirius</hi> being one day asked by his mother, of what matter ſo long diſputation was held in Counſell, (diſſembling the trueth,) anſwered, merely: whether it were more profitable for the ſtate that one man ſhould haue two wiues, or one wife haue two husbands. Moreouer, in fortitude, patience and a certaine <note place="margin">Patience.</note>ſuffering is looked for, which <hi>Tullie</hi> defineth, ſaying; patience is a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie and continuall induring of aduerſitie for honour or commodities ſake, the vſe thereof is in warre greateſt. For they that be ſoldiers, doe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7093:65"/>
often aduenture their liues, and patiently ſuffer all dangers for the loue they beare to honour and profit. This vertue is alſo at ſome times ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for the Counſellor, when he is wearied with domeſticall and publique buſines: for many troubles and cares doe happen in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale, which of force muſt be borne with patience. Surely if <hi>Corio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus</hi> in his repulſe, aſpiring to the conſulſhip, had vſed patience, he had thereby done more wiſely, and his life ſhould not haue beene followed with ſo many miſaduentures. The olde ſaying is aſſuredly true: that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is a remedie againſt all griefes: for things paſt and not recouera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble may be endured, but not amended. Our Senator indued with this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ſhall eaſely finde a meane to diſgeſt and contemne both priuate and publique ſorrowes: he that cannot endure griefe, is ſoft and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, but who ſo can, is rightly called patient, yet in the vſe of patience <note place="margin">VVhatto be eſchewed in Patience.</note>we muſt take order, leaſt through the multitude &amp; greatnes of iniuries we become diſtraught: for patience ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offended &amp; moued, prouoketh furie. Therefore griefe muſt be qualified with moderation of mind, and whatſoeuer neceſſarily muſt be borne, becommeth euery man to endure ſith all ſorrows are ouercome by patience. There is alſo a certaine aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of mind, orco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceipt of good ſucceſſe, which many times doth make vs valiant. That vertue is called Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence encouraging vs to hope well <note place="margin">Confidence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>in great &amp; honorable enterprices. Which conceipt proceedeth of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, counſell, &amp; perfect hope: For whenſoeuer we haue gotten the knowledge &amp; opinion of ſomthing, not haſtely aſſenting to reaſon: that imagination doth draw vs on, as that which we thinke honeſt, &amp; without feare reſolutely we performe it: becauſe he that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fident, feareth not. It is reported, that <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> ſeeing <hi>Caius Crastinus</hi> prepared with good hope, to fight in the <hi>Pharſalike</hi> warre, asked of him what (as he thought) would be euent of that battell? wherto <hi>Craſtinus</hi> holding vp his hand armed, ſaid, <hi>Caeſar</hi> thou ſhalt be victorious, &amp; haue cauſe eyther to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me aliue or dead: which indeed came to paſſe, for fighting moſt valiantly in that exployte he was ſlaine: and <hi>Caeſar</hi> aſſembling all his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, made an oration in his praiſe. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith that men accuſtomed to victorie doe therby conceiue a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fident hope of happie proceeding.

It is ſuppoſed that nature hath giuen vnto euery King, Prince, and great perſonage a certaine Angell to be defendor of his life, and forewarner of that he is to take in hand: which ſpirit <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> doth call <hi>Genium,</hi> other doe name it <hi>Laris, Demon, Lemuris,</hi> and we haue termed it <hi>Angelus.</hi> Which Angell doth aſſiſt valiant men in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell; and many times doth enforme them what is to be done. Of them, there are two ſortes, the one good the other euill. We reade that <hi>Vladiſlaus Iagelonus</hi> king of <hi>Polonia</hi> in the warre of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> againſt the <hi>Germaines</hi> did ſee an Angell armed aſſiſting him in fight, whome he religiouſly called <hi>Diuum Staniſlaum.</hi> By reaſon of this ſight he fought cofidently, was victorous, and in diſpite of the Tyrants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered <hi>Pruſſia. Plutarcke</hi> writeth of an euill Angell which accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Brutus,</hi> for he vpon a time reaſoning of the warre, there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a man of exceeding greatnes: and <hi>Brutus</hi> asking what he was, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered his euill ſpirit whom he ſhould ſee in the <hi>Philippian</hi> warr: which ſeemed true, for thereby he foretold both the infortunate ſucceſſe of that warre, and his death alſo. The <hi>Romaines</hi> were wont to haue confidence in the predictions of their ſpirits: as is appeareth by the inſcriptions of the ancient <hi>Romoine</hi> coyne, <hi>Genio Auguſti, Genio Senatus, Genio populi Romani,</hi> and therupon <hi>Ouid</hi> ſaith.

            <p>Moreouer, there is nothing better in confidence, then to truſt vnto wiſedome and counſell, with which confidence let our Senator be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, to make him in euery action valient, and couragious, for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpes and hopes doe ſometimes fayle, becauſe they are not in our <note place="margin">VVhat to eſchew in confidence.</note>power. Therefore as it is moſt noble, ſo is it alſo moſt ſure to haue a confident hope in vertue.

As ſecuritie is the ende of good life, ſo is it alſo the ende of a valient life: ſith thereof commeth repoſe of cares and tranquilitie

The profit of ſecuritie appeareth in the commonweale, when therein all things are peaceable, quiet, and free from perils, feares, quarrels, and troubles: which euery man calleth common happines. Yet are we to take heed, not to build our ſocietie vpon light, vncertaine, or fallible things: neither ſhall we hold our ſelues ſecure by being ſlouthfull, careleſſe, or negligent. <hi>Pompeius</hi> hauing a <note place="margin">VVhat to be eſchewed in ſecuritie.</note>great armie and comming to fight with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſeemed ſecure: yet thoſe Captaines who feared the diligence of <hi>Caeſar</hi> warned him to be vigilant; to whom he anſwered, that all was ſure, and willed them to ſleape on both ſides. But this ſecuritie deceaued him, for he was vanquiſhed by <hi>Caeſar</hi> and forced to flie. This error happeneth to many common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales: for being vſed to long peace, they deeme themſelues in ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, which may more rightly be called ſlouth, cowardice, dulnes, or negligence. In ſuch ſtates we ſee all things neglected, which appertaine vnto good gouernment: eyther to withſtand publike dangers, or make the ſubiects valiant or iuſt.

be valiant, and willingly imploy their perſons in actions militarie. There are many that onely lead with loue to honeſtie and vertue, doe rather chooſe to hazard their bodies and liues in fight, then in time of danger to abandon their Countrie, Prince, or friends. Which commendation our countrey men may challenge, becauſe they are willing to ſerue in warre, onely for honour and vertues ſake. We read that the <hi>Romaines, Germaines,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Captaines, at ſuch times as they brought their ſoldiers to fight, did alwaies animate them with perſwaſions of their owne great forces, the excellency of their Generall, the vertue of their anceſtors, and the ſpoiles of the enemies: but our chieftaines do vſe none other eloquence to incourage their armie, then this, <hi>Let each man now remember his owne vertue and reputation:</hi> which onely perſwaſion ſufficed the <hi>Polonians,</hi> whoſe propertie is eyther to be victorious, or die in the field. Who ſo therefore is ſo affected, as for loue to hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and vertue will refuſe none aduenture (the ſame being performed according to iudgement) ought iuſtly to be called valiant: as he that <note place="margin">The rewardes due to ſoldiers</note>for deſire of glorie and praiſe doth attempt all things valiantly. Which kind of men for their noteble actes, ought be honoured with rewards and badges of dignitie. And albeit ſoldiers doe more commonly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour themſelues to vnderſtand how enemies ſhould be vanquiſhed, then how ſubiectes may be gouerned, yet being wiſe men, they ought be aduanced to the dignitie of Counſellors. For it is reaſonable, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much labour in ſeruice of their countrie, they ſhould be clad in long robes, and enioy the benefit of ciuill ttanquilitie. In <hi>Rome,</hi> all ſuch ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were adopted Senators, as brought home any ſpoyle that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the perſon of the enemie, or that did weare a garland, for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a Citizen by fight. Thoſe that had borne office in the field by the ſpace of ten yeares, were admitted to ciuill magiſtracie. <hi>Regulus</hi> being remoued from the dignity of a Senator, receiued that diſgrace in ſo great diſdaine, as he tare his clothes open, and ſhewed the woundes of his bodie: thereby claiming a place in Senate, and recounted what martiall ſeruices he had done for thewelfare of his countrey.

It is the part of a wiſe and valiant man, to take for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune when ſhe offereth her ſelfe, and imploy her according to counſell. Some men voide of experience, finding things proceed to their owne liking, doe aſcribe the ſame to fortune: and ſurely not without cauſe: for as of beaſtes, ſo of fooles, fortune hath domination: yet no wiſe nor <note place="margin">Temperance.</note>good man would euer make her the guide or directer of his life. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ſo determined, that betwixt the mindes and bodies of men, there ſhould be a certaine fight and contention, ſuſpending &amp; diuerting their diſpoſitions from the true offices of vertue. For the alluring and pleaſing luſtes of the bodie doe labour to oppreſſe the minde, and hold the ſame vnder: and the minde being armed and aided with reaſon, doth reſiſt and repugne, all it is able. That vertue of minde which reſiſteth the affections and bringeth them vnder her rule, is called Temperance, commanding vs both in deſiring &amp; eſchewing to follow reaſon. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance is employed in contemning of pleaſuresand chiefly, thoſe that take end by taſte and touching. Yet doth it not generally abhorre all pleaſures, but onely ſuch as be contrarie to vertue and reaſon. There are ſome pleaſures by nature honeſt, and ſome others diſhoneſt, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them as incident to the mind, as the bodie. The comprehenſion <note place="margin">How perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man, is attained.</note>of all theſe pleaſures conſiſteth in the ſences, which are (as it were) their ſeruants and champions. Certainly it behoueth man to be not onely ſound of bodie, but alſo perfect of minde: which perfection muſt of force be attained by the exerciſe of vertue. That vſe of vertue which pertaineth to the bodie is called Temperance, working ſuch effect that it yeeldeth to reaſon, leading a life honeſt and worthie a good man. The pleaſures of bodie, be borne and from our birth bread vp with vs, which is the reſpect they are with great difficultie reftained: chiefly for thoſe men that take more delight in the exerciſes of bodie then of minde;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7093:68"/>
which among men, is of all other things moſt beaſtly and vngracious. Therefore it ſtandeth vs vpon that the body be bound to the obedience of the minde, and from it be neuer ſeparate nor remoued: for ſuch coniunction doth make men perfect. All vertues doe alſo make the commonweale happie, bleſſed, and peaceable: but Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance alone is the keeper and preſeuer of felicitie: for it forſeeth that the <note place="margin">Temperance the preſerued of ciuill feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.</note>ſtate be not infected with exceſſe and vnreaſonable pleaſures, whereby many great and moſt notable Cities haue beene ſubuerted. Euerie commweale furniſhed with good lawes and cuſtomes, ought to take heed, leaſt riott, and exceſſe ſhould poyſon the ſubiects, for thereof groweth couetuouſnes the mother of all vices. We read that in <hi>Rome</hi> lawes were deuiſed againſt exceſſe in expences and apparrell, whereby an order of good and honeſt life was preſcribed. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> alſo did keepe their feaſts in publique places, to the ende that no man ſhould dare to be waſtfull in the ſight of other Citizens. In old time the magiſtrates of <hi>Gallia Belgica,</hi> permitted not any cuſtome that might make the people effeminate. At this day in ſome Cities of <hi>Italie,</hi> the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of immoderate expences is by law inhibited. The luſte of men is inſatiable, and cannot be ſtaied but onely by the bridle of law: for it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lureth the minds of all ſubiects, and conſequently moueth them to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert their owne countrey. The conſpiratours with <hi>Cateline</hi> are therof an example, who being thriftles and licentious people, attempted to make warre againſt the commonweale. Therefore the life of euery ſubiect ought be trained to temperance, prouiding that the ſtate do not abound with exceſſe: for by that meane the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon quiet, the happines of ſubiects, their welfare, health, and ſubſtances ſhalbe preſerued, and they at all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions be ready to take armes for their country, not fearing either want of wealth, nor exceſſe of pleaſure: which two, do many times bring Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties into ſeruitude. It alſo ſtandeth the ſtate vpon, to forſee that the life of ſubiects be neither in priuate or publique, intemperate, nor that any man ſhould abuſe welth and ſubſtance. A temperate &amp; moderate life in priuate men, is an ornament of common foelicitie. Inſolency of life is therfore to be ſuppreſſed, for from thence as the head, all conductes of miſchiefe do take their beginning. And the Counſellor himſelfe ought to be no leſſe free from intemperancy, then he would haue others.

Yet do I not require in our Counſellor that baſhfulnes which is peculier to yong men, or offendors. Becauſe ſuch perſons are moſt <note place="margin">Two ſorts of baſhfulnes.</note>commonly againſt their will baſhfull, and aſhamed. That pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of mind doth misbecome a graue &amp; temperate man. But the baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes we ſeeke for, doth imitate vertue: and therby a certaine habit and exerciſe of eſchewing euill; ſo as, if at any time through ignorance error be committed, we are therof aſhamed, which is very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable. <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> fighting with the yonger <hi>Pompeius</hi> at <hi>Corduba,</hi> and ſeeing his ſoldiers readie to runne away, paſſed forth before the foremoſt ranke, &amp; there moſt valiantly fought in perſon: which the ſoldiers ſeing, could not for ſhame but turne face to the enemie, prouoked partly with the the valure of the generall, &amp; partly with their owne ſhame faſtnes</p>

For they commaund not onely to contemne the inticements of deſires, but alſo ſtaie our mindes, our eies, and our handes from following vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble affections. There is no ſpectacle of life more noble, then to ſee men contented with their owne and not couet things appertaining vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> is commended, for that of all the treaſure which was brought from <hi>Macedon</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> he conuerted no part to his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate vſe, but deliuered all into the publique Threaſurie, chooſing rather to abſtaine and continue poore, then become rich by deceauing. For after death, his goods being ſold vnder the Launce (as the cuſtome was) there wanted whereof his wife might be ſuſtained. The example of <hi>Scipio Affricanus</hi> his continency is moſt admirable: he being but twentie yeares of age at the taking of <hi>Carthage,</hi> found there (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many other captiues) one maiden of moſt excellent beautie; yet would he not touch hir virginitie, but deliuered her vnto an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band whom ſhe was before betrothed vnto: and gaue her in mariage all that golde which her friends offered, to redeeme her. I omit to ſpeeke of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, and many others, who gained no leſſe glorie by continency, then martiall triumphes.

It becommeth a Pretor to haue not onely hands free from corruption, but alſo continent eyes voyd of vnchaſt lookes.

All pleaſures not being reduced to neceſſitie and honeſtie, are reprochfull: and aboue the reſt, thoſe two which are taken by touching and taſting, doe draw men moſt to offend in vice, and vncleannes. A counſellor therefore ought to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that the life of ſubiectes be not tombled into this myre of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſnes and ſoule delights, but that all things may be done with ſhamefaſtnes and honeſtie.

The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were wont to ſhew their dronken ſeruants vnto their children, to the ende that they (lothing their vile geſtures and beaſtialitie) might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide the vice of much drinking. But would God we were as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to follow, as remember thoſe ancient cuſtomes. Great was the moderation and temperance which our anceſtors vſed in their diet: for they liued not to eate, but did eate to liue. In theſe daies, the plague of intemperance is growne ſo great, as more men periſh by inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie and gluttonie, then by force or fury of warre. Alſo in ſome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions men take no delight but onely in drinking. Who would not then commend <hi>M.

beene by immortall fame preſerued. <hi>Hortentius</hi> was much reprooued for that he, at a ſupper (prepared for the <hi>Auguri)</hi> ſet before his geſts a boyled peacocke: likewiſe <hi>Caſsius</hi> was deemed intemperate, becauſe publiquelie he dranke water, and could not endure thirſt for a ſhort time. <hi>Duronius</hi> was alſo remoued from the Senate, for that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tribune, he caſſed the lawe concerning the reſtrainte of feaſting. Surely the <hi>Romaine</hi> ſtate was happy in hauing ſuch Senators as were not onely princes of Counſell, but alſo maſters of good manners and vertues. Whereof may be coniectured how temperate the people of <hi>Rome</hi> were in thoſe daies. It is reported that when the preſents which <hi>Pirrus</hi> king of <hi>Epirus</hi> (after his ouerthrow) were brought vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſhewed about the ſtreats: hoping thereby to winne good will of the people, there was nor one man ſeene to put out his hand towards them: fo as that king found himſelfe no leſſe vanquiſhed with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie then force of armes. But when exceſſe, after the victorie of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> had entred <hi>Rome,</hi> and that through plentie and idlenes, the peoples mindes began to grow wanton, ſodainly that ciuill diſcipline of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancie, parcimonie, and ſocietie, were extinguiſhed: and in liew therof, couetuonſnes accompanied with all miſchiefes poſſeſſed the Citie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which (as <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſaith) way the very cauſe that deſtroyed the <hi>Romain</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre. The Counſellor therefore muſt foreſee that in the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale exceſſe may not long indure: becauſe it peruerteth publique peace, and maketh the ſubiects ſoft, effeminate, miſerable and needy. <hi>Diogenes</hi> hearing that the houſe of a certaine prodigall man was offred to ſale; ſaid, I knew well that houſe was ſo full of meate and wine, as (or long) it would vomit out the maſter. The Counſellor ſhall alſo eſchew nothing more in his owne perſon, then immoderate eating and drinking: becauſe it conſumeth the force both of bodie and minde. Notable is that lawe of <hi>Solon,</hi> which iudgeth a drunken prince wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of death. <hi>Philip</hi> king of <hi>Macedon</hi> being diſguiſed with drinke, gaue iudgement againſt a woman: ſhe furthwith appealed, and being asked to whom? anſwered to king <hi>Philip</hi> when he is ſober. Certainly the force of wine taketh away all iudgement in man; in ſo much as thereby kings are made ſeruants, olde men become children, wiſe folkes are turned to fooles, and fooles changed to mad men. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor therefore ſhall obſerue meaſure, and drinke for neceſſitie, not for ſacietie: following the counſell of <hi>Anacharſis,</hi> who ſaid that the firſt

draught was of neceſſitie, the ſecond of ſuperfluitie, and the third of madnes. It were moſt vnſeemely in a Senator to haue a countenance full of furie, eyes full of anger, and ſpeech full of pride, all which doe accompanie dronkennes: and as euill it will become him being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with meate and wine to conſume the whole night in ſleaping. But how much good diet helpeth to preſerue health, &amp; prepare the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to action, we may learne by experience. For by moderate diet we finde not onely the minde, but the bodie alſo more obedient, but ſacie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and fulnes of belly, is no other, then a ſepulture to a liuing minde. It therfore beſeemeth a Senator not onely priuately, but alſo publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to obſerue parcimonie and frugalitie. Yet heed muſt be taken, leaſt he ſeeme ouerſparing, hard, or ſtraight in expence: for it is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a bace and abiect minde to abuſe comlines and honour in his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Therefore priuate exceſſe ſhalbe baniſhed, and publique magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence <note place="margin">Order and rule of mans life.</note>retained: needleſſe delicacy, but (much more) miſery and ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardlines muſt be auoided. For as immoderate expences be hurtfull, ſo neceſſarie and conuenient fare is honeſt and wholſome. Reſpect is alſo to be had to the place, the time, and perſons: waying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, what belongeth to priuate and publique honeſtie, dignitie, and profit, not neglecting the change of exerciſes and honeſt pleaſures. <hi>L. Tubero</hi> making a publique feaſt, couered all his beds with the skins of kids, and for ſo doing was thought indiſcrete, and ignorant in things belonging to publique honour and reputation: alſo for the ſame was depoſed from the office of <hi>Pretor.</hi> But of Temperancy let this ſuffice which we haue hitherto ſpoken: Let vs now (ſith the time and order of our matter ſo requireth) intreat of the goods of bodie and fortune, wherewith the felicitie of a Counſellor is not onely ornified but alſo made perfect. For ſo much as the bodie of man, is, (as it were) a dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place, and tabernacle of his mind, it behoueth vs and our liues to be furniſhed no leſſe with the perfections of minde, then of bodie. For as the actions of vertue cannot be exerciſed by a weake bodie, ſo the bodie wanteth power to performe his duetie, being gouerned by an imperfect minde. Theſe two are ſo coopled and conioyned together, that as the Maſter without a ſeruant, ſo the minde may not execute his duetie without obedience of the bodie. Therefore the philoſophers writing of pollicy, doe conioyne the exerciſes of bodie and minde, as though men imperfect eyther in bodie or mind were improfitable in the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7093:71"/>
ſocietie of men. Euen as ciuill diſcipline and good lawes doe worke the <note place="margin">How perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind and bodie is attained.</note>perfection of minde: ſo nature (chiefly ioyned with exerciſe) doth make the ſoundnes of bodie: which is conſerued by phiſicke. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in commonweales well gouerned certaine lawes and ages for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ought be preſcribed &amp; likewiſe education ordained for children, to theende they may be informed in ciuill diſcipline. So as by nature and art, the people may become both of minde and bodie moſt perfect. But ſith heretofore we haue diſcourſed of the qualities of mind, and the perfections thereof: it reſteth now to ſpeake of thoſe qualities of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die which ought to be in a Counſellor. For it behoueth him much to be as perfect in bodie as of minde. True it is, and that trueth by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men confirmed, that the felicitie of man, cannot be defended with the vertues of minde onely, but needeth alſo vnto the perfection therof, externall commodities. Which albeit are not by themſelues laudable, yet becauſe vertue is knowne in their vſe and moderation, they ought greatly to be deſired. The goods of the bodie do ſeeme to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt partly in the whole bodie, and partly in particuler mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: <note place="margin">Perfection of bodie.</note>for health, beautie, ſtrength and ſoundneſſe, are required in the whole bodie: but perfect ſence, and nimblenes of legs and hands, are wiſhed for onely in ſome parts. As there is a ſociety and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of body and minde, ſo is there a certaine liking and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence betwixt the vertues of bodie and minde. Health reſembleth Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: becauſe it reduceth the diuerſe conſtitution of bodie to an equall temperance: ſo beautie is likened to Temperance: and they both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire in the perfections of bodie &amp; mind. Strength is compared to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, becauſe in the enduring of labour &amp; danger, the one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth aide the other. Soundnes of bodie is likened to Prudence: For as Prudence doth reconcile all opinions and iudgements, euen ſo in a ſound bodie, all partes doe ioyne and make one perfect bodie. How much health auaileth to lead a good and happy life, experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. For there is nothing that we can doe or thinke, but therein good <note place="margin">Health.</note>health doth helpe vs, and the want thereof doth hinder vs. We will therefore that our Counſellor ſhould be healthie, for thereby he may the better attend publique affaires, vſe the exerciſes of bodie, &amp; lead a quiet and contented life, free from griefe &amp; all ſorts of ſorrow. The firſt cauſe of health, is God, the maker of all bodies: the ſecond good diet and exerciſe. For great regard muſt be had, leaſt health be
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7093:72"/>
taken away by negligence or intemperancie. Health (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith) is maintained by knowing a mans owne bodie, and obſeruing of thoſe things, which agree, or diſagree with nature: alſo by being continent, in diet, apparrell, and contempt of pleaſures: whatſoeuer elſe apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to this matter, muſt be learned of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates. Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> was wont to laugh thoſe to ſcorne that by ſacrifice ſought for health of the gods, and notwithſtanding lead an intemperate life. A good conſtitution of bodie is alſo commendable in a Counſellor. Let him therefore eyther be (as the phiſitians doe terme it) ſanguine, <note place="margin">VVhat tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of bodie, is beſt.</note>or colloricke: for thoſe humors doe make men apt for vertue: and ſuch perſons are commonly wittie, docible, healthie, and of good memories. <hi>Aristotle</hi> calleth melancholy men wittie, for being incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to anger they are diſpoſed to haue in them certaine diuine thoughts and deepe cogitations. Notwithſtanding we vtterly exclude them from counſell, as men vnmeete for affaires of ſtate, becauſe their liues are, for the moſt part, gouerned by malancholy and not by wiſedome. The humor moſt abounding in that complexion, is cold and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ie; which maketh their cogitations to be ſolitarie, inclined to enuie, ſowerneſſe, ſadneſſe, and ſorrow. <hi>Cicero</hi> reading that place of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> which calleth melancholy men ingenious, ſmiling ſaid, that he reioyced much that nature had made him dull witted and not melancholy. <hi>Caeſar</hi> being war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to beware of a certaine fat, merry, and liberall ſpeaker, anſwered that ſuch men were not to be feared, but thoſe rather that were ſad of ſwarfie complexion and leane; pointing to <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſsius.</hi> We al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo miſlike that any flegmaticke perſon ſhould be ſo much as the <hi>Romaines</hi> called him <hi>Pedarius Senator:</hi> leaſt his humor be offenſiue to all the reſt: For as the motion of flegmatike bodies, is ſlowe, and heauie, ſo likewiſe is their diſpoſition of minde. Alſo good propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or comelines doth recommend, not onely the bodie, but alſo the minde, ſo as, it ſeemeth, the Poet ſaid well.

bodies (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) there is no great vertue, and in ſhort perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, as little. Moreouer, his bodie ſhould not be exceeding groſſe, nor exceeding leane and drie, for the one is apt for trauell, the other ouerweake to indure paine. We alſo commonly take heede of thoſe whom nature hath marked by defect of any member, as they that are lame of one legge, ſquint eyde, or deformed in perſon: for ſuch men are accounted craftie and ſubtill. Neuertheleſſe, if any ſuch perſonage be knowen for good, and by the excellency of vertue hath ouercome the imperfection of nature; then ſhall he deſeruingly be admitted to the dignitie of Counſellors. The proportion of face or viſage, is much beautified by good collour or complexion, which oftimes bewraieth the ſecret conceits of mind. Our inward diſpoſition is alſo ſometimes knowen by the outward collour of skin. <hi>Philopaemen</hi> a notable Captaine <note place="margin">Philopemen.</note>of the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> was an euill fauored man, and being taken priſoner, was forced to cut wood. Afterwards he became knowen, and ſaide; that he ſuffered the puniſhment due to his deformitie. We therfore commend a graue &amp; pleaſant face in our Counſellor: and allow moſt of ſuch eies as are ſweet &amp; not cruell; for that countenance is fitteſt for men of ſuch qualitie. Yet is not the coniecture we haue by the features of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſo certaine, as thereby we may exactly iudge the vertue of mind: for many there are, whoſe perſons be not beautifull, yet in mind are vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, that is to ſay, iuſt, prudent, &amp; temperate. The mind is not ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed by deformitie of bodie, but by beauty of mind the bodie is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified. Vertue is not bound eyther to a beautifull or deformed body, but is of it ſelfe comely, and doth grace all bodies with beautie therof. And therfore it behoueth vs in knowing of men, to vſe not onely eyes, but alſo iudgement: euen ſo not onely the perſon countenance &amp; eyes of a Counſellor, but alſo the whole face of a Counſellors minde ought be conſidered &amp; preferred before all beautie &amp; good proportion of bodie. All theſe things may be wiſhed for the perfection of men, but are not commonly looked for.

The Senators of <hi>Rome</hi> vſed a garment ſet full of ſtuds or tufts of gold, and on their hoſe they weare like vnto
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7093:73"/>
a moone, which were the cogniſants or badges of moſt honour. That kind of ornament, the <hi>Romaines</hi> ſeeme to haue receiued from other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <note place="margin">Cal ceilunats.</note>For <hi>Eſaias</hi> the prophet foretold the noble women of <hi>Iudaea,</hi> that God would take away thoſe moones and ornaments of hoſe. <hi>Plutarch</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth ſower cauſes, why the <hi>Romaines</hi> ware ſuch hoſe: which to delight the reader, I wil recyte. The firſt was, becauſe they thought that the ſoules of great men ſhould by light of the moone be guided the next waie vnto heauen. The ſecond reaſon that moued them, was that the ſigne of the moone, did ſhew they were diſcended from the <hi>Archadians,</hi> who came into <hi>Italie</hi> with <hi>Euander,</hi> for the <hi>Archadians</hi> did imagine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues more ancient then the moone. The third cauſe why they ware the moone was, to the ende, that in proſperitie they ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the inconſtancie and mutabilitie of Fortune: For as the moone moſt commonly is in parte lightened and in parte darkened, ſo no honour or felicitie of men, can be ſo perpetuall, but is ſometimes obſcured or extinguiſhed. The fourth cauſe was, for that the ſigne of the moone, doth ſtirre vp mens mindes to modeſtie and obedience: mouing them to pray vnto God for wiſedome, whereby both to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund and obey: euen as the moone doth take her brightnes from the ſunne, being a more noble and excellent light, ſo ought men to ſeeke for wiſedome from heauen. Others doe fable and affirme, that the Senators of <hi>Rome</hi> ware not the image of the moone, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the letter <hi>C,</hi> as though the hundereth whom <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi> did chooſe to be, (as he called them) <hi>Patres</hi> ſhould thereof take <note place="margin">The degrees of men ought be knowen by their appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.</note>their title. In good commonweales the vſe hath euer beene, that a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of eſtates and degrees of men, ſhould both by lawe and vſe be knowne by the peoples garments: and that cuſtome is aſſuredly of much moment to make them conſtant in their profeſſions, and in the couerſation of common tranquilitie. Which was alſo the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that among the <hi>Romaines</hi> no man might weare purple, but onely Senators, Magiſtrates, Prieſtes, and young men of noble families. I omit to ſpeake of rings, chaines, and bracelets which were giuen to men of vertue, aduanced to dignitie. How theſe cuſtomes are in theſe daies obſerued, it ſufficiently appeareth: for we may behold a greate alteration not onely of vertues and manners, but of times alſo: ſith the garments of ſoldiers, magiſtrates, and ſenators, doe not differ from the habite of ſeruantes, marchantes, artiſans, and plowemen.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7093:73"/>
True it is, that the vertue and condition of men is not bound to any badge or ornament: yet is he thereby put in mind, with more diligence to maintaine and exerciſe the office belonging to his dignitie. For Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Crownes, Cheynes, Rings, Gownes, Robes, and Saddles, are no dignities, but the badges of dignitie, wherewith men are ſtirred vp to performe and doe honour to the office and place whereunto that badge <note place="margin">Badges of honour.</note>belongeth. <hi>Romulus</hi> (as <hi>Liuie</hi> writeth) intending to gouerne a newe people, apparrelled himſelfe with an habit of maieſtie, and called twelue <hi>Littori</hi> with maſes, to attend vpon his perſon, thereby to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare with more reputation, and reuerence. It ſhall therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our Counſellor to be apparrelled according to his grauetie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> honour, and dignitie: taking heede that his garments doe not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe any varietie, lightnes, or inconſtancy. He muſt euer obſerue therein a certaine comely neatnes, ſuch as beſeemeth men and not wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; not exquiſite or curious, but comely and manly, yet void of ruſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. Let him alſo in all motions, geſtures, ſtandings, goings, ſittings &amp; lyings, frame a good grace and grauetie beſeeming a Counſellor. It is alſo very neceſſary, that he be ſtrong of bodie, well knit, and manly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned. <note place="margin">Strength of bodie.</note>Which things becauſe they proceede from nature, he ſhall be more carefull in vſing and conſeruing them, then diligent in attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto them. Strength is commonly in thoſe men that be ſound, nimble, and firme fleſhed: which things with age doe naturally encreaſe and decreaſe: for young men are ſtrong and mightie, but olde men be broken and feeble. And for ſo much as, the force of minde is more requiſite in a Senator then the ſtrength of bodie: therefore we deſire not in him the force of a gyant, but conuenient and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſtrength. <hi>Milo</hi> being growne olde, beholding cettaine wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers contending in ſtrength, looked vpon his owne loynes weping. and called them dead: becauſe (as I thinke) his whole vertue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour reſted in the ſtrength of his bodie, We are now to diſcourſe, what <note place="margin">The age of a Counſellor.</note>age is moſt fit for the perfection both of bodie and minde, and of what yeares a Counſellor ought be. They that haue deſired the length of mans life, doe confine the ſame within a certaine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of time. <hi>Plato</hi> aſſigneth eightie one yeares, <hi>Solon</hi> eightie, and others affirme the life of man to be determined within ſeauentie yeares: becauſe they referre all to the number of ſeauen, ſith euerie ſeauenth yeare ſome mutation of bodie appeareth. The firſt ſeuen years

the teeth of children doe fall: the next ſeauen yeares, their heare doth grow, the third, their bodie is at the longeſt: the fourth, their bredth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the fift, they are ſtrongeſt: the ſixt, deſirous of pleaſure, the ſeauenth wiſe, the eight aged, the ninth feeble, and the tenth prepared for death. Others affirme that the change in mans life is euery nine yeares: and ſome aſcribeth alteration therof at euery vnequall number till twentie and one. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> called the eightie yeare of mans life, fatall deuiding the ſame into fower times twentie: ſo as childhood ſhould laſt till twentie, youth other twentie, mans eſtate other twentie, and olde age doth determine all, after the fourth twentie: comparing it to the foure ſeaſons of the yeare: the ſpring time was likened to children, ſommer to young men.

With this opinion we thinke good to concurre: but the diſtinction of ages by number, <note place="margin">Critici vel iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiarii dies.</note>doth chiefly appertaine to phiſitions, for they in their fomentations and mede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But our opinion is that the fortie fiue yeare of mans age is moſt meete for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, becauſe about that time, man is of moſt force both in bodie and minde.

When <hi>Rome</hi> flouriſhed, the Senators were choſen of that age: becauſe thoſe yeares were accounted apt for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, in reſpect the heate of youth was cooled, and the minde attained to perfection: for as the perfection of bodie commeth by age, ſo is the minde thereby made ripe in wiſedome and experience. Yet denie I not that many men are olde at thirtie yeares, that is to ſay, they be then both prudent and wiſe, for they deſiring to be olde long, begin ſoone to be graue.

            <p>In <hi>Athens</hi> no man was created a Counſellor before fiftie yeares of age, and in <hi>Rome</hi> it was lawfull for any man of ſixtie yeares to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Senate, although he had neuer beene elected a Senator, and after that yeare he had liberty to come or not at his pleaſure. In that point therefore the cuſtome of each commonweale muſt be obſerued, and euery Counſellor (though he were in age euen with <hi>Nestor)</hi> ought to endeuour himſelfe at all times and in all places to employ his power for the Commonweale. <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith; that men ſhould learne, till they be ſo aged, as one foote is entred the graue: but why doth it not become them aſwell to counſell and ſerue their countrey? Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we forbid men much aged, decrepit, and decayed as well in <note place="margin">The qualitie of decrepit age.</note>minde as body, to giue counſell. Becauſe their counſels be common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doubtfull, and their iudgements are rather coniectures then affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, alwaies vſing theſe wordes, perchance and perhaps. The cauſe thereof is, that they haue proued ſundrie perrils, and are affraid to <note place="margin">Goods of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune requiſite for a Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor.</note>feele them againe. Now for ſo much as the felicitie of man without externall goods cannot be abſolute: therefore they are for a Senator of much neceſſitie, aſwell to ornefie his eſtate and dignitie, as the more commodiouſly to performe the actions of vertue. Vpon this pointe, the philoſophers doe grealty contend: for ſome of them doe exclude the goods of Fortune: and others affirme the poſſeſſion of Fortunes giftes to be of neceſſitie in mans felicitie. Both which opinions are true, if we conſider the condition and ende of each mans life. For they that affect priuate felicitie, haue none or very little need of Fortune: but others that doe exerciſe vertue publiquely, liuing in the ſocietie of men and gouerne the commonweale, cannot without the goods of Fortune performe any great, notable, or liberall action. Therefore riches, lands, and poſſeſſions are of neceſſitie for a ciuill man &amp; magiſtrate: aſwell to exerciſe the offices of vertue, as to relieue the people, and repulſe iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7093:75"/>
ſo as it is apparant, that without externall goods euery ſtate is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> miſerable and vnhappie. Me thinks therfore, the philoſophers had done more wiſely, if they had diſputed of the vſe of riches, and not of riches it ſelfe, deuiding felicitie according to the condition of perſons. For it is not felicitie, but the life of man, which needeth things requirable to the ſuſtentation of life. Whereof the condition being diuerſe, it behoueth each man aboue all things, to know the ſtate of his life &amp; felicitie, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſo much ſubſtance as is thought neceſſarie to liue well and happely. For which reſpect, the felicitie of <hi>Diogenes</hi> was farre other, then the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie <note place="margin">The felicitie of Alexand. and Diogenes diuers.</note>of great <hi>Alexander:</hi> the one was poore, the other rich: the whole world could not ſuffice the one, the other was contented with a ſilly cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin. Their orders of life were diuerſe, ſo was alſo their felicitie: yet were they both philoſophers, but the one delighted in priuate felicitie, and the other affected publique happines: this ought be commended, the other not diſpraiſed. That courſe of life is to be followed imbraced and retained, whereunto God, nature, election or will hath called vs: and the ſame ſhould be ornified, as vertue, reaſon, God, and nature it ſelfe requireth. Which is the cauſe, that ſome had rather be poore then rich, learned them wealthie, priuate then publique, ſoldiers then prieſts: for for each man eſteemeth the life he beſt liketh. But for ſo much as the life and felicitie of a Counſellor is laid open to the face and ſight of the commonweale: it behoueth him in any wiſe to be furniſhed with the goods of Fortune, as, good parentage, honour, glorie, fame, friends kinsfolke, children, riches, and money. I wiſh the parentage of <note place="margin">Good paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſellor.</note>a Counſellor ſhould be good, for that many times of honeſt parents good children be gotten. Let him therfore be borne a gentleman, and diſcended from a ſtocke or houſe of nobilitie or gentrie: for that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour left from his anceſtors, was giuen by the commonweale, to the ende that at occaſions he ſhould with the more fidelitie fight for his countrey. There was a lawe in <hi>Rome,</hi> whereby Senators were forbidden to marry women that had beene ſlaues. Neither was it lawfull for any gentlewoman to take a husband of baſe parentage, or that was diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">New nobility.</note>from ſuch parents as exerciſed any miſtery or gainfull traffique. Yet do I not diſlike of thoſe that take the badges of honor from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and make the foundation of their nobilitie vpon their owne vertue. For vertue entreateth both new and ancient men after one faſhion, for ſhe refuſeth none that reſorteth vnto her for honour. It is reported that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7093:75"/>
               <hi>Cato</hi> being in contention with <hi>Scipio Affricanus,</hi> ſaid merely, that <hi>Rome</hi> would become glorious, if great noble men, did not yeeld the chiefe part of vertue vnto their inferiours: and contrariwiſe, if the multitude (whereof he was one) did contend in vertue with thoſe that were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in parentage. Moreouer touching the beginning and originall gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie is to be conſidered, who is in deed aſpired to honour by the right degrees of vertue, for the new gentleman ought not be accounted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the olde, if he be aduanced for no light or fained vertue, but <note place="margin">How new no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie is Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable.</note>is made noble in reward of his great, labourſome, and honeſt induſtrie. In conſideration whereof, the vertue militarie and the vertue of wiſdom &amp; dou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell, be preferred before all conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>platiue vertues, wealth &amp; riches. In euery commonweale two rewards are prepared for vertue: the one <note place="margin">Honour and glorie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</note>is honour, the other glorie: which who ſo hath, cannot be called infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate. Honour conſiſteth partly in hauing authoritie and office, and partly in the reputation which is giuen by great and notable men for the excellent vertue they thinke to be in him who is honoured. <hi>Tullius</hi> ſaith, that is true honour, which is giuen to noble men, not in hope to haue benefit from them, but for their excellent deſerts. Who ſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſireth honour, muſt not onely attaine therunto by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing olde painted armes or images engraued in braſſe, but by his owne vertue; whereunto the true and euerlaſting rewardes are belonging. <hi>Cato</hi> ſeeing <hi>Rome</hi> filled with the portratures of noble men, refuſed to haue any made of him, ſaying, he had rather men ſhould aske why he had none, then why he ſtood there. For the honour due to vertue, ought be perpetuall and euerlaſting: not fading or ſubiect to ruine. Of three hundreth portractures ſet vp for king <hi>Demetrius,</hi> not one was by time decayed, nor by negligence defaced; but in his owne life they <note place="margin">Glorie.</note>were all turned vpſide downe. Yet a counſellor ought to deſire glory, as the moſt notable reward of vertue. And he is in glory moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that paſſeth all others in vertue. <hi>Theſius</hi> asked of the Gods three things, that is, good fortune, want of inward ſorrow, and ſuch glory as was neither falſe, counterfeite, nor fained. Who ſo ſeeketh glorie for vertue, and noble acts, doth not commit any thing diſhonourable, eyther towards himſelfe or others: becauſe he meaſureth his fame and dignitie by vertue and iudgement. It is the propertie of men well borne <note place="margin">Fame.</note>and liberally brought vp, to deſire the good report of his countrey, ſtrangers, friends, and leaue good fame to his poſteritie by conſent of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:7093:76"/>
all honeſt people. All men therefore (but chiefly Counſellors) muſt take heede, leaſt they make any euill impreſſion to deface their good name or fame, for ſeldome eyther in time preſent, or age to come, by vertue of poſteritie it can be cancelled. For time ſpeaketh, and fame is neuer ſilent, alſo libertie of tongue remaineth to thinke and pronounce the ſayings and actions of other men. Moreouer we one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe not reape the fruite of good fame, but our neighbours, friends, and children are thereof partakers: in ſo much as all people and their poſteritie doe commend vs, admyring our liues, and extolling the time wherein we liued, the commonweale where we gouerned, and the lawes by vs ordained. In our owne life time it behooueth vs to doe the like, leaſt vertue, faith and religion doe ſeeme in vs altered and extinguiſhed, or that our poſteritie ſhould imagine that we did degenerate from the vertue of our anceſtors, or willingly reiected their precepts. Fame is the ground of perpetuall commendation: therefore let each man eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewe vice with the danger of diſeſtimation: for the loſſe of Fame and fidelitie, are greater diſaduentures then can be imagined. It was proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by lawe, that no wan of corrupt fame ſhould be choſen a Senator <note place="margin">The loſſe of Fame of all others grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt.</note>of <hi>Rome.</hi> And he was holden of corrupt fame, that had beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for a diſer, a deceiuer of others, a theeſe, an vniuſt man, a falſe performer of teſtaments, a lyar, an hereticke, a baniſhed man, or knowne guiltie of any other enormitie whereby good fame was blea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed. In <hi>Athens</hi> there was an order, that the life of euery Senator before his creation ſhould be examined. Alſo <hi>Solon</hi> prouided by lawe, that no man miſliked of honeſt men, or noted of diſhoneſtie, ſhould be admitted a Senator. Which kinde of men we alſo diſalowe, iudging them not onely vnfit for the place of Counſellors, but alſo vnworthie the name of men. Therefore the whole life of our Counſellor muſt be referred to vertue and honeſtie: for of them all true glorie, fame, praiſe renowne and dignitie groweth.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Friendes.</note> Moreouer the vſe of friends and neighbous, doth greatly beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the honour of Counſellors: ſith they doe not onely make mans life happie, but alſo comfortable. For it is a ſinguler pleaſure to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate our affaires with friends, vſing their fidelitie, and both in priuate, &amp; publique buiſines, to be helped with their aide and aſſiſtance. <hi>Alexander</hi> being asked where he would haue his treaſure preſerued: anſwered, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his friends, becauſe he thought, good will to be the owner both of his,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7093:76"/>
and other mens riches. Alſo to ſuch a Counſellor as is deſirous of <note place="margin">Children.</note>poſteritie, a number of good and honeſt children are an inlargement of felicitie. For men haue no treceiued from God any benefite ſo great, as is ofspring and diſcent of children, whereby we enioy immortall and eternall increaſe of life. <hi>Bercilidas</hi> a chieftaine or gouernour in <hi>Sparta,</hi> ſitting at meate, did forbid that the yonger ſort ſhould doe him reuerence: reprouing himſelfe of barrenneſſe, becauſe he had not begotten any children to doe them the like honour when they were olde. In <hi>Rome</hi> the cuſtome was, that they who had furniſhed the commonweale with children ſhould be after exempted from the payment of taxes, and in token thereof, thoſe men were called <hi>Proletarij.</hi> But let vs now ſpeake of riches, the poſſeſſion wherof is for a Counſellor of ſinguler neceſſitie: for money is not onely needed in <note place="margin">Riches.</note>priuate, but alſo in publique affaires, and without it he cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any notable or vertuous action. Maieſtie without force is ſlenderly aſſured, and wiſedom without authoritie, muſt yeeld to folly. The opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> is, that the gouernours of Cities, ſhould be ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ouer rich, nor ouer poore: for the one doth make them coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſlouthfull, ſubiect to pleaſures, and deſirous of nouelties the other maketh them ſilly, weake, and ruſticall. Therefore the wealth fit for a Counſellor, ſhould be ſufficient for his degree, and gotten without reproch. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> produceth two meanes of gaining riches: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one is according to nature, and honeſtie, the other againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and diſhoneſt. The naturall meanes of getting, is by agriculture hunting, fiſhing, fowling, and ſuch like, which containe not in them any deceiptfull permutation. Agriculture (as <hi>Cicero</hi> affirmeth) is of all other things the beſt, the moſt profitable, moſt pleaſing, and moſt worthie a free man. <hi>Cato</hi> being asked by what meanes a man might ſoone become rich, anſwered, by feeding of cattell: and being asked the ſecond time, ſaid: by well and fat feeding. Whereby he ſeemed to thinke, that riches gotten by tillage, and nouriſhing beaſtes, was of all other the moſt honeſt. When the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi> would commend any man, they vſed to call him a good man, and a good husband, in ſo much as the Senators themſelues liued in the countrey, and at occaſions, were by purſuiuants called to the Citie. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Quintius Cincinnatus</hi> &amp; diuerſe other notable men were called from the countrey, to be made <hi>Dictators.</hi> But it is to be thought, that their
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7093:77"/>
dwelling the villages was rather for ſolace, and recreation, then for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any neceſſitie wherein they liued. Gaines againſt nature, are all kind of craftes for lucre, merchandiſe, and vſurie: becauſe men doe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſeeke diſhoneſt profit, and be therein onely occupied. <hi>Cato</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked what he thought of vſurie, anſwered. What is it to kill a man? A Senator therefore muſt in no wiſe meddle with any diſhoneſt gaine, he muſt alſo auoide all baſe and fowle trauelingetting his riches: for by ſuch exerciſes the honour of a Counſellor is defiled. It was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prouided in <hi>Rome,</hi> that no Senator ſhould be owner of any ſhip containing 300. Amphore, becauſe immoderate gaines was not in the noble men allowed. Alſo it muſt needs be, that thoſe that binde themſelues prentice to bace and ſoule gaines, will not thinke vpon ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt matters and be carefull of the commonweale: therefore ſuch Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators were depoſed from the <hi>Romaine</hi> Senate. All honeſt riches do ſeeme to conſiſt in money, lande, houſes, houſhold ſtuffe, ſheepe, ſlaues, and ſuch like things which are imployed in honeſt and liberall <note place="margin">Valewation of wealth.</note>labours. There was a cuſtome in many commonweales (and chieflie populer ſtates) to create the Senators according to their wealth, and for that purpoſe a valewation was made of each mans ſubſtance. <hi>Solon</hi> deuided his valewation or ceſments into foure. The firſt was of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thoſe that were rated at the ſecond valewation, were called <hi>Equites.</hi> They that were rated in the third valewation, were termed <hi>Zeugitae,</hi> as men that deſerued one horſe, and in the firſt valewation, all Senators, Magiſtrates, and great no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men were included. Among the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> no man was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a magiſtrate, that had not of wealth ſufficient to contribute to the publique feaſt called <hi>Phidicia. Plato</hi> likewiſe deuided his commonweale into foure valewations, ſo as the whole number of Citizens were included in the firſt, ſecond, third, and fourth valew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. In like manner the <hi>Romaine</hi> ſtate had a certaine diuerſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lewation, for in the one the Senators and in the other the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens <note place="margin">Valewation neceſſarie.</note>were valewed. It ſeemeth therefore neceſſarie in all common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales, (for thereby order of ſtate is obſerued) that cuſtomes and taxations be continued, the famelies numbred, the peoples manners reformed, all exceſſe extyrped, and men made diligent in defending their countrey. The Cenſors or valewers of <hi>Rome,</hi> were the tutors
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7093:77"/>
for good manners, and conſeruers of ciuill and honeſt diſcipline, as were the <hi>Nomophilaces</hi> among the <hi>Graecians.</hi> Notwithſtanding, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not good to me (be it ſpoken without offence) the Counſellors <note place="margin">Riches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vertue nor worthy honor</note>ſhould be choſen onely in reſpect of their riches. For to giue the gouernment into the handes of the moſt wealthie ſort, doth ſeeme as though the charge of a ſhip, were deliuered, not to the beſt ſaylor, but the richeſt paſſenger: whereof perils and ſhipwracke will enſue: <hi>Plinius</hi> finding fault with the <hi>Romaine</hi> magiſtrates, their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and euill manners, doth attribute the cauſe of all their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to the reſpect they bare towards the wealth of men: ſaying thus: after Senators were created for their riches, Iudges promoted for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, magiſtrates aduanced for money: and chieftaines elected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were rich, the price of mans life was troden vnder foote. True it is, that riches without vertue it little worth, but being ioyned to vertue, doth increaſe a happie life. Therefore Counſellors ought be both rich and vertuous: and if any tich and good man being of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie to gouerne in the commonweale do refuſe the dignitie of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, he ought by the law of Senſures to be therunto co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled, for it is a ſhamefull thing not to ſerue that ſtate which begot him, &amp; that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey which gaue him life, honour ſubſtance, &amp; education. But here heed muſt be taken, that witleſſe rich men, fit for nothing, ſhould not in any ſort be made magiſtrates: for honour giuen to ſuch perſons, doth transforme them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fooles to mad men. It is very reaſonable that rich men of good deſert ſhould haue ſome preferment in the ſtate, becauſe they haue moſt ſubſtance, chiefly, if they be iuſt, prudent and learned. Otherwiſe, to aduance men for riches only is againſt Iuſtice: for they are apt to iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the poore, and proane to ſedition and innouation. We are now to <note place="margin">Reward due to Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors.</note>declare what rewards are due to Counſellors, what fruit belongeth to their labour, and what recompence the commonweale ought giue to their excellent wiſedome and worthines. For we are all allured and drawen by hope of reward to exerciſe the actions of vertue. The opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Solon</hi> was, that commonweales were preſerued by two things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is to ſay, by reward and puniſhment: which not being beſtowed according to the vertue and vices of men, the ſtate might be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnhappy and miſerable. It is therefore fit that Counſellors ſhould <note place="margin">Rewards of vertue diuers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>receiue rewards, not only of vertue, but alſo of honour, &amp; authority. The reward beſtowed by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monweales (as <hi>Cicero</hi> thinketh) do conſiſt, either
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7093:78"/>
in fauours, in profit, or in honour. Theſe are therefore to be looked for, eyther at the hande of the commonweale, or of God. But the moſt noble reward is glory, for vertue deſireth none other recompence of her labour, but the glory and praiſe thereunto due. All honeſt tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell of Senators ought be rewarded with honour glory, and renowne. There is no pleaſure among men (as <hi>Xenophon</hi> ſaith) which approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo neare the nature of God, as to enioy honour and glorie. The graces which God hath beſtowed on men are ſo great, as neyther in word or thought can be expreſſed; Yet doe we giue vnto him, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, praiſe, and glory, as that which is thought greateſt, and moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. As therefore in all other things, ſo therein let the Counſellor imitate God, eſteeming that reward for his vertue, dignitie, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to be greateſt, which conſiſteth in commendation, glorie, and exaltation of his name. And euerie good man ſetteth his chiefe glorie <note place="margin">VVherein the glorie of a Counſellor conſiſteth.</note>in vertue; As the ſoldier in fight, and the captaine in victorie: So the whole glorie and honour of a Counſelor is diſcerned by preſeruing the people, wel gouerning the ſtate, and doing things worthy commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. He muſt alſo account the office of a Senator to be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt reward of his vertue: For as dignitie in a perſon vnworthie is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie, ſo the ſame in a man worthie is a ſigne of greateſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glorie. For indeed to greate men greate honours are due. Our Senator therefore ſhalt repute himſelfe to be beſt honoured and rewarded for his vertue: When he is applauded of the people, of all men highly eſteemed and by publique conſent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to be a father, preſeruour, and defendour of his countrie. The badges due to ſuch honour are not vaine or mortall, but immortall and eternall: for they remaine for euer impreſſed in the Poeples mind, extant in the memory of poſteritie, and in mouthes and the eares of the whole commonweale. Of that praiſe and honour, our children, our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and friends doe participate: ſuppoſing it their duetie to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate ſuch actions, to be equall vnto ſuch anceſtors, and (if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) ſurpaſſe them in glory: ſo as, all good men by this deſire of praiſe and glorie, doe deſerue well of their commonweale, and countrey. The houſes of Senators muſt be as it were nurſeries of vertue, where <note place="margin">Counſellors ought be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.</note>the commonweale may (as a field repleniſhed with vertue,) reape good fruit. The Senators ought therefore to be highly honoured and reuerenced of other ſubiectes, not onely in reſpect of their
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7093:78"/>
age (which is due to all aged men) but for their authoritie, dignitie, wiſedome, fidelitie and diligence in gouerning the commonweale. Who ſo therefore ſhall diſhoneſtly or irreuerentely abuſe them, is <note place="margin">Iniurie of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

By the law (called <hi>Lex honoria)</hi> it was prouided that no man ſhould doe iniurie to any Senator, for he that ſo did, ſhould be reputed a traitor, &amp; offendor: <note place="margin">Ornaments and rewards of the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Rome.</note>not onely againſt the gouernours, but alſo the Senators, being reputed as members of the lawe.
