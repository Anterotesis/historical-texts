            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>THE LIFE OF DEMETRIUS POLIORCETES
Rendred into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> By <hi>JOHN NALSON,</hi> LL. D. VOLUME V.</head>
               <p>INgenious men have frequently compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Arts and Learning to our Natural Senſes; and doubtleſs they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to do ſo from that reſemblance, which the one hath to the other in diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing between different objects: But
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36410:6"/>
ſtill, we muſt allow the precedence to Learning and Knowledge; for that the higheſt attainments of ſenſe, arrive only to an Exact deſtinguiſhing between mean and Common Objects, as black and white, ſweet and bitter, hot and cold, ſoft and hard, and this too, in an humble ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to the Underſtanding, to which they make reports according to the different im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which they do receive: Whereas skillful Arts and Sciences, having the more elevated advantages of Inquiry and Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, do not only enable us to know what is moſt agreeable, but by a prudent foreſight to abſtain from what is Evil, and prevent what may be dangerous. Thus the Wiſe <hi>Phyſician</hi> comes by his ſucceſsful Art, not only to underſtand how to combat a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſtemper; but to ſecure the Health of his Patients for the future; and the art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Muſician</hi> does not only know how to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ungrateful diſcords, but even from thoſe diſagreeing Notes to compound a wondrous Harmony.</p>
               <p>But above all, Temperance, Juſtice and Prudence, the nobleſt of all the Moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, do not only aſſiſt us with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what is Honourable, Juſt and Good, but give us the Reverſe of the contrary Vices, which ought to be avoided, as diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, unjuſt, and altogether diſadvantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36410:6"/>
to us: and even this ſort of knowledge of what is evil, is ſo neceſſary to the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conduct of humane Life, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, there would be no glory or vertue in abandoning thoſe evils which we did not know; ſince otherways it muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the ſtupid ſimplicity of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Chance, and not to a wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Choice. It was for this Reaſon, that the ancient <hi>Spartans</hi> were uſed in their moſt celebrated feſtivals and entertainments, to load their <note n="*" place="margin">Ilotas</note> ſlaves with prodigal glaſſes, and then expoſe thoſe drunken miſerables to the publique view; that ſo, the young Gentlemen of the City ſeeing the deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and antick dreſſes into which that transforming Vice degrades Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they might at the expence of thoſe poor wretches, imprint an early averſion to debauchery, in their tender minds. And tho' poſſibly it is but an indifferent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, nor very conſiſtent with Humanity, to chaſtiſe vice in one, by forcing it upon another, yet it will not be unacceptable, amidſt the great variety of examples in this Book, to expoſe to the view of the World, ſome pairs of noble Lives, who being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in the triumphant Chariot of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Authority, have, by their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate folly and imprudence, tumbled from the height of Fortune into great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36410:7"/>
and thereby have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves great examples of the Impotence and danger of great vices, even in the greateſt Men. There is a ſtrange pleaſure in variety, but yet I muſt averr, That my deſign is not only to divert the Fancy of the Reader, by ſhewing diverſity of curious Figures, but to advantage him in the management of his own Affairs; to which nothing can contribute more, than the eaſy way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wife and Vertuous at the expence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mens Misfortunes; for as <hi>Iſmenias,</hi> the fam'd <hi>Theban</hi> Artiſt, was wont to ſhew his Scholars both the moſt excellent Maſters in Muſick and the verieſt Bunglers in the Science, that ſo they might imitate the one, and deſpiſe the other; and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genidas</hi> was uſed to ſay, that ſuch young Gentlemen as applied themſelves to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining skill in Muſick, would be more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in their Induſtry by the pleaſure they received from hearing ſprightly Airs and Compoſures, after they had been firſt tired with the dull entertainments of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and unskillful Muſicians; ſo it appears highly reaſonable, that the examples of thoſe Lives, whoſe Vices and Follies have deſervedly expoſed them to the Cenſure of the whole vertuous World, ſhould raiſe in us a Noble Emulation to imitate the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſuch others, as were the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious

                  <hi>Antigonus</hi> had by his Lady <hi>Stratonice,</hi> the beautiful daughter of <hi>Correus,</hi> two Sons, the one after the Name of his Uncle he called <hi>Demetrius,</hi> the other carried the name of his Grandfather <hi>Philip,</hi> and died young. This is the moſt authentick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, although ſome have reported, that <hi>Demetrius</hi> was not the Son of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> but of his Brother; and that his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dying young and his mother being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards married to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to adopt him his Son.</p>

                  </note> Princes of the World, tho' he was not altogether ſo tall as his Father <hi>Antigonus,</hi> yet he was of the largeſt proportion of men; but withal he had a Face ſo delicate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, that the moſt curious Painter or Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, was not able to form any <hi>Idea,</hi> out of his own Imagination, comparable to thoſe ſweetneſſes, which every feature of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable Face had only peculiar to it ſelf: there was ſomething, one knows not how to expreſs it, ſo ſoft, and yet ſo fierce, that it did at the ſame time appear both charming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tender, and Imperiouſly aſtoniſhing; challenging both an irreſiſtible, venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a paſſionate kindneſs; ſuch a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Majeſty, Youth, beauty and vivaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as gave him one of the moſt Auguſt and Noble Airs in the World. Nor did his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36410:8"/>
outward adornments at all contradict the inward Inclinations of his nature, for there was no perſon who had ſo great an Art to render himſelf both lov'd and fear'd; for as he was the moſt eaſie and agreeable perſon in his converſation, the moſt ſplendid in his entertainments, and in ſhort, one who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged himſelf and his friends the utmoſt liberty and freedoms in the enjoyment of his pleaſures, ſo was he, of all the Princes of his age, the moſt vigilant, dexterous, and addreſsful in the proſecution of his martial affairs; ſo that his whole life ſeemed divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded between the Love of pleaſure and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; herein propoſing to himſelf the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> the Divinity he chiefly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored, equally famous for his ſucceſsful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements in the time of Action, and his luxuriant gaieties in the Leiſure of Peace.</p>
               <p>He was a moſt paſſionate lover of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and the natural tenderneſs and deference which he had for his Mother, obliged him, for her ſake, to redouble that love, which it was evident was not ſo much owing to fear, or barely Duty, as the more powerful ties of Choice and Inclination: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that it is reported, that returning one day, from hunting, he went up imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately into the Apartment of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who had newly given Audience to certain
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36410:9"/>
foreign Embaſſadors, and after he had made his Obeyſance to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who tenderly careſſed and kiſſed him, he repoſed himſelf upon one of the chairs, ſtill holding the Javelins in his hand, which he had brought with him from the chace; whereupon <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus,</hi> who had juſt diſpatched the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, commanded them to be again introduced, and ſhewing them his Son in that free poſture and equipage, <hi>You may, my Lords,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if you ſo pleaſe, relate to your Masters, above what you have already recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Commiſſion, after what manner of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jealous freedom, my Son and I live together:</hi> By this Action informing them, that this was no flender mark of the power and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of this Government, where there was ſo perfect a good Underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Prince reigning and his Heir ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent; and that whereas commonly unſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable Majeſty is ſurrounded with Armed Guards, and inward jealouſies and diſtruſts, it was the glory of the Greateſt of all the Succeſſors of the mighty <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he had the happineſs to be ſo perfectly aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his ſon, that he could without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty permit him the freedom of coming thus Armed into his preſence. And to ſpeak the truth, among all the Succeſſors of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> was the only Houſe, which for many deſcents was
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36410:9"/>
exempted from bluſhing, with the ſhedding of their own Royal blood: and whereas in this illuſtrious Family, only <hi>Philip</hi> was guilty of the death of his ſon, all the reſt afforded frequent examples of Fathers who brought their Children, Husbands their wives, Children their Parents, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Funerals; and for the Brothers to diſpatch each other was ſo common, that as Mathematicians lay down to themſelves certain firſt Principles, ſo this was eſteemed by them as a <hi>Maxim,</hi> to aſſure themſelves of the Royal Diadem, by ſacrificing their Brothers to the fears and jealouſies of their proving dangerous Rivals to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty.</p>
               <p>But that we may the better underſtand the excellent temper of the young <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> and what juſt and honourable ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, even his early years had for his Friendſhips, we muſt recount an odd ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture which paſſed betwixt him and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi> the ſon of <hi>Ariobarzanes;</hi> this young Prince, who was about the ſame age with <hi>Demetrius,</hi> was educated in the Court of <hi>Antigonus;</hi> and although he had the Reputation of an innocent and undeſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſon, yet could he not avoid falling into the diſpleaſure of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <note place="margin">The Dream of <hi>Antigonus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </note> extreamly ſuſpicious of him by reaſon of a Dream which he had one night con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36410:10"/>
him; for in his ſleep, Imagination, which then moſt abuſively plays the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton with us, when ſhe has put all our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the ſervants of reaſon, into their dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny manacles, preſented <hi>Antigonus</hi> with this Fantaſtique ſcene: He thought himſelf in a fair and ſpacious Field, where he ſowed Golden ſeed, from whence he ſaw a moſt wondrous crop of that ſhining Metal imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to ſpring, and ſucceſſively to grow up to that maturity to hang its ripened heads, ready to bow to the fatal ſtroak of the ſickle; that ſhortly after, returning in high expectancy to reap the tempting Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, he found it all cut down, and nothing left but chaff and ſtubble; whereupon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly diſcontented at the unexpected diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, he thought he overheard cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſons diſcourſing that it was <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi> who having reaped the Golden Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, was returned with it into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Pontus. Antigonus,</hi> ſtrangely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with this Dream, relates it to the Prince, and having firſt obliged him, by whatever was ſacred, not to diſcover his intention, acquaints him with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution he had taken againſt the life of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates. Demetrius</hi> was moſt ſenſibly touched with this cruel reſolution of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> againſt an Innocent Prince, his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, his Confident, Companion, and Friend,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36410:10"/>
and not knowing how to manage himſelf with Innocence, betwixt his Friendſhip to the Prince, and his promiſe to his Father; but the next morning <hi>Mithridates</hi> coming ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his cuſtom to divert himſelf with <hi>Demetrius,</hi> he drew him aſide from the Company, and without opening his lips, with the point of his Javelin he traced theſe few words in the Duſt, obliging <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> to read them, <hi>fly inſtantly, and ſave your Life, Dear Mithridates,</hi> and without further notice, putting them out with his foot, they returned to their Company, and purſued their accuſtom'd Divertiſements and Sports.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who was very apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, eaſily perceived by this Artifice that ſomething fatal was determined againſt him by <hi>Antigonus;</hi> and therefore ſecretly taking Poſt that very Night, he quitted the Court, and made his Eſcape into <hi>Cappadocia;</hi> where reſolving to be revenged of <hi>Antigonus</hi> for this intended Perfidy, he immediately rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a numerous Army, and not long after accompliſhed the Dream of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> whom, by the force of his Armies, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoiled of many large Provinces and Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories; and by his great ſucceſſes Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Royal Houſe of <hi>Pontus:</hi> The laſt of his Race and Name, and the eight in lineal ſucceſſion from him, being that unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

                  <hi>Mithridates</hi> King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> whoſe deſtiny ſo lately made an addition to the Triumphs of the irreſiſtible <hi>Roman</hi> Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles.</p>
               <p>This may ſerve for a ſpecimen of the Early and uncommon Generoſity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Demetrius;</hi> but it was not long before his boyling youth, tranſported with the ardent deſire of Fame and Glory, met with greater occaſions of ſignalizing his Courage and his Arms; for as <hi>Empedocles</hi> wittily obſerved, that there was a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual hoſtility among the four Elements which Compoſe the Univerſe, every one of them ſtill combating with his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and all of them continually ſtriving to inlarge the boundaries of their Empires; ſo did it happen among the potent Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the great <hi>Alexander,</hi> betwixt whom, eſpecially thoſe whoſe Dominions lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous, there was an Eternal Jealouſie, and almoſt perpetual Wars: For <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who kept his Reſidence in the Metropolis of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> being advertiſed that his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> having paſſed from the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> did with a potent Army invade <hi>Syria,</hi> and had reduced moſt of the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable places in that Country under his Obedience, either by force or Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he diſpatched his Son <hi>Demetrius,</hi> not then much above the Age of twenty two
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36410:11"/>
years, at the head of a Gallant Army, to arreſt the ſucceſſes of the Victorious <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:</hi> This was the firſt time, that he had appeared in Arms as an Abſolute General and Commander; and our young Captain, whoſe heat was ſomething too diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate to his Conduct, with mighty Eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and haſty Marches, advances with his Army to ſeek his Enemy? and receiving intelligence that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was with all his Forces ſate down before <hi>Gaza,</hi> he marched directly thither; upon his approach <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy</hi> drew off his Army from the Siege, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as willing as <hi>Demetrius</hi> was haſty to put the matter to the fatal deciſion of the Sword: But here Fortune, who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reſolved to ſhew her inſtability, was not at all Propitious to <hi>Demetrius;</hi> for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Cruel Battle, which was obſtinately maintained by <hi>Demetrius</hi> with the loſs of five thouſand of the moſt Valiant of his Soldiers, he was compelled to reſign the Victory and the field to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who took, beſides eight thouſand Priſoners, all his Arms, Carriages, Ammunition, and his Camp, which was exceeding Rich: Nor was it at all ſtrange, that a young Prince of ſo ſlender Experience in military affairs, ſhould be vanquiſhed by an Old beaten Captain in the Trade of War, and one trained up under the Diſcipline of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:36410:12"/>
by whoſe prodigious Fortune even vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory herſelf ſeemed to be overcome, and to ſubmit her ſelf tamely to his conquering Arms. However <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who was as truly generous as he was great, made a moſt honourable uſe of this advantage, for he immediately returned all the Rich ſpoils of the Field, together with the inlarged Priſoners, with this Complement to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius, That he had not combated with him for Riches, but for Glory and Empire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> was infinitely ſurprized at this unexpected generoſity, and one might ſee the warm blood mount into his Face, to be a ſecond time vanquiſhed by this oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing civility of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> which was more inſupportable than what he had ſuffered by his Arms, but as ſoon as he had a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the diſorder, into which this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had put him, <hi>May the Gods, cried he, accord me this only bounty, that I may not long be indebted to</hi> Ptolomy, <hi>but that it may one day come within my Power to return him the ſame Complement and favour, which he hath now put upon me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It might well be expected the diſgrace of this diſaſter, to be defeated in the very firſt enterprize of his Arms, would have cooled the courage of our young Warriour; and poſſibly few perſons of his Age, would have been able to ſupport ſuch a notable
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36410:12"/>
Overthrow, with ſo much Temper: but <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who was a very extraordinary perſon, demeaned himſelf upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion even to admiration; rather like an old Captain who had been long acquainted which the traverſes of a capricious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant Fortune, than a young and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced Prince: for he ſet himſelf, with all the application imaginable, to provide Arms and Magazines; to rally his diſperſed Troops, to reinforce them with Recruits, and to exerciſe his new Levies in the diſcipline of War, he ſtrengthned all the conſiderable Garriſons, and with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied deligence performed all the Duties of an expert General, and by his example infuſed new Life and Courage into the hearts of his Soldiers, inſomuch that they, who before were almoſt ready to preſent the Conqueror with the Keys of thoſe Cities which they were to defend, now put on Reſolutions, not to part with an inch of Ground, which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> ſhould not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe with the hazard of his Life. When the news of this Defeat was brought to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus,</hi> he received it without any greater emotion, than ſaying, <hi>Ptolomy has indeed got a Victory over a Company of Youths, but ere long he ſhall find, that he must combat with Men:</hi> intimating, that ſhortly he would undertake the management of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36410:13"/>
War in his own perſon. But <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſending to beg the favour of him, that he might once more throw the Dye of War, and Command the Army againſt <hi>Ptolomy: Antigonus</hi> who feared leaſt the diſgrace of being denied, might more abate the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the Prince than the loſs of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Battel, ſent him a new Commiſſion to execute the Office of an abſolute Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
               <p>Not long after <hi>Cilles, Ptolomy</hi>'s Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General, with a powerful Army took the Field, and looking upon <hi>Demetrius,</hi> ſince his laſt overthrow, as the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a baffled and half vanquiſhed Army, he had in his imagination driven him out of <hi>Syria,</hi> before he ſaw him: but he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found himſelf deceived; for <hi>Demetrius</hi> by haſty marches came ſo unexpectedly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that he ſurprized the General and his Army, making him, and 7000 of the principal Officers and Soldiers, priſoners of War, before they heard of any approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Enemy: the whole Booty of the Camp, which was very rich, fell likewiſe into his hands; but it was not that which gave <hi>Demetrius</hi> any ſatisfaction, comparable to the pleaſure which he took, when, by this advantage, he found himſelf in a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be generouſly revenged upon <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> for his laſt obliging courteſie: Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,

                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> in this affair was reſolved to comport himſelf according to his Duty, and therefore he diſpatch'd an Expreſs to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> to give him an account of this good Fortune, and to receive his directions and commands, how to diſpoſe of his Conqueſt. <hi>Antigonus</hi> who was moſt ſurprizingly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with Joy at this unexpected news, and not leſs at the Noble Inclinations of his Son, immediately returned him in Anſwer, that he left him intirely at his own Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Diſcretion, to make what Uſe he pleaſed of the Victory which he had gain'd. <hi>Demetrius</hi> was even raviſhed with content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at his Commiſſion, which was ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his wiſhes; and therefore ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>Cilles,</hi> he not only gave him his own, and the Liberty of all the Priſoners, but diſmiſs'd them loaden which magnificent preſents, and the Admiration of his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity; deſiring <hi>Cilles</hi> to oblige him with carrying this Meſſage to <hi>Ptolomy, That he made him that ſmall preſent, in return of the Favours he had received from him at</hi> Gaza.</p>
               <p>This defeat was ſo cloſely followed by <hi>Demetrius,</hi> that in a little time he obliged <hi>Ptolomy</hi> to abandon <hi>Syria;</hi> and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled the affairs of that Province, he haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to return into the Arms of his Father, who then kept his Reſidence at <hi>Celene:</hi> So ſoon as <hi>Antigonus</hi> was advertiſed of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:36410:14"/>
he had not the patience to attend the ſhort delay of his coming, but with a noble Train he immediately left the City, and went to meet the Prince; and with what careſſes and indearments ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Father entertained a Son ſo hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and promiſing, is difficult to imagine, but impoſſible to expreſs; but he conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him home in great triumph, amidſt a thouſand acclamations and other ſigns of joy, which ſeemed to be owing rather to his ſafe return than the proſperous ſucceſs of his Arms.</p>
               <p>But it was not long before <hi>Antigonus</hi> was forced to loſe the ſatisfaction of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; being obliged to ſend him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the <hi>Nabathean Arabians</hi> to their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: and in this Expedition <hi>Demetrius</hi> ran one of the greateſt hazards of his whole Life; for the Wild <hi>Arabs,</hi> decoyed him into thoſe parched Deſarts, which afforded no manner of ſubſiſtence, nor ſo much as a drop of water to refreſh his Army; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reduced him to this extremity, they drew up their forces to give him Battel: But when thoſe barbarous people obſerved the courage and reſolution of the Prince, and that he was ſo far from being in the leaſt daunted at their approach, that he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeemed to flie like a hungry Lion upon the prey, as if he had reſolved to quench
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36410:14"/>
the thirſt of his Soldiers with the blood of his Enemies, they were ſo aſtoniſhed, that conſulting their fear, they thought it fitter to commit their ſafety to their heels than hands, and therefore with great precipitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diſorder, they quitted the field, leaving <hi>Demetrius</hi> not only poſſeſſed of the Victory, but of a very conſiderable Booty, among the reſt 700. Camels with all their Lading of Water and other proviſions, with which he refreſhed his Army, and ſafely retreated out of that ſcorched Country, more barbarous than its wild Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Not long after, <hi>Seleucus,</hi> whom <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> had formerly chaſed out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving raiſed all the forces he was able, with his Army inveſted that mighty City, and without much reſiſtance, made himſelf Maſter of it, and elevated with this ſucceſs, he puſhed on his good Fortune, and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the Countries next adjacent to Mount <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> and the neighbouring <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> hoping to ſubdue thoſe Regions, and range them under his Dominion and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> being advertiſed of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and conjecturing, that he had left <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> but flenderly guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his abſence, he paſſed the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> with his Army, with ſuch ſecrecy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, that with his whole power he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:36410:15"/>
had inveſted <hi>Babylon,</hi> before they had heard of the march of his Troops. He immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately command an attacque to be made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one of the Cittadels, which <hi>Seleucus</hi> had raiſed for the ſecurity of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant place, which was performed with that vigor and reſolution, that he carried the Fort; but finding himſelf not in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to maſter the City, he left 7000 Men in Garriſon in the Fortreſs, and with the groſs of his army retreated homewards; but in his return he gave his Soldiers the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to live at deſcretion, who in their march took from the Inhabitants of thoſe Countries, through which they paſſed, whatſoever they thought fit; by which ill treatment of thoſe People, though he did extreamly enrich his Army, yet he impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed his own Reputation, and loſt the affections of thoſe Countries, who ever after, by the ill uſage they received from <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> were the more firmly devoted to the Obedience of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> to whom he ſeemed to yield the Title of their Sovereign, by treating them like Enemies, and not his own Subjects.</p>
               <p>In his return having received Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> laid cloſe Siege to the City of <hi>Halicarnaſſus,</hi> he marched directly thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and obliging him in ſome diſorder to decamp, and retire from before it, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36410:15"/>
that City from an imminent danger, and by his Expedition and ſucceſs in that Action, brought a great Addition to the Reputation and Glory of his Arms.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Demetrius,</hi> burning with the ardent deſire of Glory, had fixed his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns upon an enterprize, which was ſuitable both to his own, and the Inclinations of his Father <hi>Antigonus;</hi> and that was to break the Yoke of ſlavery, which <hi>Caſſander</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> had laid upon the neck of the little <hi>Grecian</hi> Commonwealths, and to render thoſe Countries Maſters of their ancient Laws of Freedom; and certainly never any Princes undertook a War more generous and brave, ſince the only motive that induced them to it, was the glory to reſtore their Freedom to the miſerable <hi>Grecians,</hi> and that they undertook it wholly at their own charges, and with the treaſure which they had recovered from barbarous Nations, they attempted the aſſiſtance of the moſt civilized and learned, tho' moſt oppreſſed People of the World. To effect this great Deſign, it was reſolved, at a Council of War, that the firſt attempt ſhould be made upon the City of <hi>Athens;</hi> upon the debate of which point, when one of the great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains gave his opinion, that if they could make themſelves Maſters of that City they ought to keep it in their own poſſeſſion,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36410:16"/>
for that it would ſerve them as a Bridge, over which they might at deſcretion, paſs into the reſt of <hi>Greece; Antigonns</hi> moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly as well as prudently replied, that the ſureſt Bridge to paſs over upon ſuch an Enterprize was the Hearts and Inclinations of the People, which would moſt aſſuredly be loſt, if that City were kept; and that <hi>Athens</hi> being one of the moſt celebrated <hi>Academies</hi> of the World, one ought to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer nothing prejudicial to that Repoſitory of Arts and Learning, if, at leaſt, they conſult their own future reputation, which muſt in time to come be meaſured by thoſe accounts, which from thence would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to Poſterity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who had raiſed a Fond of five Thouſand Talents to defray the charges of this War, having with great applications rigged and equipped a Fleet of two hundred and fifty Gallies, he weighed Anchor, and the Wind ſtanding fair, he ſteered a direct courſe to the City of <hi>Athens,</hi> where at that time <hi>Demetrius Phalereus</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as Deputy Governor under <hi>Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> had his reſidence, and had placed a ſtrong Garriſon in the Fortreſs of <hi>Munychea.</hi> Upon the twenty fifth of May, the Wind freſhing up into a briſque Gale, and <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> who was reſolved to improve the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour which Fortune ſeemed to lend him,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36410:16"/>
by the addition of Artifice, hanging out <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Flag, bore directly in for the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeeum</hi> or Port of the City: The Centinels, who diſcryed the Fleet at ſome diſtance, made no doubt but that they were Friends, nor was the Error diſcovered till it was too late. It may well be imagined, that this ſurprize put the Captain of <hi>Caſſander</hi>'s Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and the whole Garriſon into ſuch great confuſions and diſorders, as uſually happen upon ſuch approaches of an unexpected Enemy; and while they were preparing to make the beſt defence and oppoſition, which the ſuddenneſs of the Accident would permit, <hi>Demetrius</hi> who perceived the Mouth of the Haven defenceleſs and open, ſtood in directly into the Port: as ſoon as he was entred, mounting upon the Poop of the Admiral Gally, and making a ſignal with his hand, that he had ſomething to ſay, he cauſed a <hi>Herald</hi> with a loud voice to make Proclamation, that he was come thither with that mighty Fleet, by the Command of his Father, but with no other Deſign than what he prayed the Gods to proſper with ſucceſs proportionable to his pious Intention, which was to deliver them from the oppreſſion of <hi>Caſſander;</hi> to chaſe out that Armed force, by which he held them in a cruel Subjection, and to reſtore to them the freedom of their ancient Laws and Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:36410:17"/>
The People hearing this, preſently threw down their Arms, and clapping their hands, with loud acclamations of Joy they immediately intreated. <hi>Demetrius</hi> to land, calling him their Deliverer and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor, and aſſuring him of a Welcome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. This ſuddain revolt of the Citizens obliged <hi>Phalerius,</hi> who ſaw it impoſſible to reſiſt, to ſend certain of his Officers to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> to requeſt from him, upon his Surrender, honourable Uſage and Protection from the outrages of the People, who hated him for <hi>Caſſander</hi>'s ſake, and whoſe inſolences, in this change of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, he had but too juſt apprehenſions to be afraid of. <hi>Demetrius</hi> according to his accuſtomed Generoſity, treated the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers very reſpectfully, and having an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Veneration for the perſon, and Vertue of <hi>Phalerius,</hi> he ſent <hi>Ariſtodemus</hi> of <hi>Miletus,</hi> a particular favourite to <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> back again with the Meſſengers, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <hi>Phalerius,</hi> and thoſe under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, not only of their Liberty but ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and accordingly he ſent them away with a ſufficient convoy to the City of <hi>Thebes;</hi> whither <hi>Phalerius</hi> deſired he might have Liberty to retire.</p>
               <p>Now though <hi>Demetrius</hi> had the moſt paſſionate deſire in the World to view the ſo much celebrated City of <hi>Athens,</hi> yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:36410:17"/>
ſolemnly Vowed he would not enter into it, till he had given it entire Liberty from <hi>Caſſander,</hi> he forbore it for the preſent, and having blocked up the Cittadel of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichia</hi> with a ſtrong Rampart and deep Graff, he immediately weighed, and with his Fleet ſtood over for <hi>Megara,</hi> where alſo <hi>Caſſande</hi> had a ſtrong Garriſon, which would if not removed, prove an uneaſie Neighbourhood to his newly delivered <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whileſt his Army laid cloſe Siege to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara, Demetrius</hi> underſtanding that <hi>Crate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipolis</hi> the Widow of <hi>Poliperchon,</hi> a Lady whoſe beauty was in greater Reputation than her Vertue, was at <hi>Patras,</hi> and that as he underſtood, ſhe had no Averſion for him, he reſolved ſecretly to make her a Viſit; and therefore leaving the Siege, he took only a few light Horſe-men for his Attendants, and went in purſuit of this extravagant A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: And that he might without diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and with more freedom injoy the converſation of this celebrated beauty, he commanded his Retinue to Pitch a Tent at ſome diſtance from <hi>Patras,</hi> and there to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his return, and ſo with only two or three of his moſt intimate confidents, he took his way towards the City; but whether by the treachery of the Lady, or by pure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident is uncertain, ſo it happened, he fell
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36410:18"/>
into an Ambuſcade of a party of <hi>Caſſander</hi>'s Troops, and was ſo warmly purſued, that he was obliged by changing his Coat with one of the ordinary Soldiers, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſing himſelf by the ſwiftneſs of his Horſe to purchaſe a diſhonourable ſafety, the juſt reward of ſuch an adventure, narrowly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaping being made a Priſoner to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by rendring up his Liberty to the charms of a Laſcivious Woman, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtifiable Paſſion; the Party finding he was too well mounted to be taken, returned and ſeized his Tent where they found many cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious preſents intended for his Miſtreſs, which made another addition to the loſs of his Honour and Deſign, tho a reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the undertaking.</p>
               <p>But he had better ſucceſs in his Wars than in his Amours, for returning to the Camp, he ſtormed the City of <hi>Megara,</hi> but at the requeſt of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who had aſſiſted him in the Expedition, he would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his Soldiers to commit any violences or ſpoil, but having chaſed away the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he reſtored the Inhabitants to their freedom and laws, as he had before treated the <hi>Athenians:</hi> It happened that the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher <hi>Stilpon</hi> did at that time reſide near <hi>Megara,</hi> a perſon of great Reputation for his retired and contemplative Life; <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> who had a great Curioſity to ſee him,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:36410:18"/>
ſent for him, and the Philoſopher being come into the preſence, <hi>Stilpon,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I hope you have received no ill <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage; nor loſt any of your Goods by my Soldiers; my Lord,</hi> replyed he ſmartly, <hi>I have not met with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who have thought knowledge or Virtue ſo valuable as to plunder them from me;</hi> but it ſeems, that upon the taking of the City <hi>Demetrius</hi> had beſtowed Liberty upon all the Slaves, and among the reſt upon the only one belonging to the poor Philoſopher; and when he was about to take his leave, <hi>Demetrius,</hi> having Extreamly careſſed him, <hi>Well Stilpon,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I leave your City in perfect Liberty and freedom; True my Lord,</hi> anſwered he briskly, <hi>for you have not left us ſo much as one Slave belonging to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> returning from <hi>Megara</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſate down before the Cittadel of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nychia,</hi> which in a few days he took by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault and cauſed the fortifications to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed; and thus having accompliſhed his Deſign, at the importunity of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> who requeſted him to refreſh himſelf after his Fatigue, he ſolemnly entred the City, where cauſing the People to be ſummoned, in the Audience of a numerous Aſſembly, he publickly acquainted them; that he did not only freely reſtore them to the Liberty of their former Popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36410:19"/>
but would prevail with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Antigonus,</hi> to beſtow upon them fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand Meaſures of Wheat, and ſuch a proportion of Timber, as would enable them to build an hundred Gallies for the defence of their City. In this manner did the <hi>Athenians</hi> recover their Popular ſtate, after they had loſt it for the ſpace of fifteen Years, from the time of the fatal War of <hi>Lamia,</hi> and the unlucky Battle before the City of <hi>Cranon;</hi> after which they had been under a ſeeming <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> but really un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſingle Government of <hi>Demetrius Phalerius</hi> the Deputy Lieutenant of <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the exceſſive honours which the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> beſtowed upon their deliverers <hi>Antigonus</hi> and <hi>Demetrius,</hi> drew upon them the envy of other Princes, and an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Jealouſie among all their neighbours; for here it was, that by the Courtſhip of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> they firſt took upon them the Stile of Majeſty and the Title of Kings, which hitherto they had declined, as only of right appertaining to the lineal deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, and which the reſt of his Captains ſeemed to renounce. But ſo tranſported were the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that with a Wild and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Gratitude, they beſtowed upon them not only the Title of Kings, but of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36410:19"/>
their <hi>Tutelary Deities and Deliverers:</hi> and to enhance the complement, by a common Vote it was decreed to change the ſtile of the City, which formerly named the year according to the Name of the Annual Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate; ſo that now a Prieſt of the two <hi>Tutelary Divinities,</hi> who was to be year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly choſen, was to have that honour; and all publick Acts and Inſtruments were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to bear their <hi>Teste</hi> under his Name. And in the Enſigns of their City they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Pourtraicts of theſe two Princes to be drawn among the reſt of the Gods, the Patrons and Guardians of their City. They alſo cauſed an altar to be erected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated in the place where <hi>Demetrius</hi> firſt alighted from his Chariot, calling it the <hi>Altar of the Deſcent of Demetrius;</hi> they added two new Companies or Tribes to their former Number, calling them after the Names of thoſe Princes <hi>Antigonides</hi> and <hi>Demetriades;</hi> and to the Senate which conſiſted of five hundred perſons, fifty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choſen according to the ancient conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, out of every Tribe, they added one hundred more out of theſe two new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies. But the moſt ſordid of all their groſs and unmanly flatteries, was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree propoſed by <hi>Stratocles,</hi> by which it was ordained and Enacted, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, which they ſhould ſend to <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:36410:20"/>
and <hi>Demetrius,</hi> ſhould have the ſame ſtile and Character with thoſe which were accuſtomed to be ſent to <hi>Delphos,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Oracle of the <hi>Pythian Apollo,</hi> or to <hi>Elis</hi> to the <hi>Olympian Jupiter,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the <hi>Grecian</hi> Solemnities, and to make oblations for the ſafety and preſervation of their City, whom they called, <hi>the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of the Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Stratocles</hi> was a perſon of a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent and vicious temper, one who had led a lewd and diſhoneſt life, not much unlike the infamous <hi>Cleon;</hi> for his Concubine one day bringing him a diſh of certain heads for his Dinner; <hi>Look,</hi> ſaid he diſdainfully, <hi>I muſt dine upon heads, which we ſtateſmen play with like Tennis-balls.</hi> At another time, when the <hi>Athenians</hi> received that notable defeat near the Iſland of <hi>Amorgos,</hi> he haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the encounter, and before the news could arrive at the City, having got a Chaplet of flowers upon his head, he came riding through the <hi>Ceramique</hi> ſtreet, with ſuch a ſhew of triumph, as if the <hi>Athenians</hi> had been Conqucrors, and inſtantly commanded all the People to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thanks to the Immortal Gods, and keep a ſolemn Feſtival for the happy Victory. But whilſt they were in the height of their gaity and joy, the Meſſengers, who had made no haſt to bring the evil tidings, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:36410:20"/>
with a true account of the Diſaſter, and the People being inraged that he had thus impoſed upon them, he confidently came among them, and made this jeſt of the matter, <hi>Very fine,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and I warrant you think you do bravely now to be angry, and to reproach me for having made you two Holidays.</hi> This was the way of this humoriſt <hi>Stratocles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that I may allude to the words of the Poet <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi>
               </p>

                  <l>Such ſtrange exceſs tranſported their deſire,</l>

               </lg>
               <p>For there was another of theſe audacious flatterers, who reſolving to out ſhoot <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocles</hi> in his own Bow, propoſed, that it ſhould be decreed, that whenſoever <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> ſhould honor their City with his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al preſence, they ſhould treat him with the ſame Ceremonies and Honours, as they were accuſtomed to pay to the Deities of <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and that to make his reception more ſplendid and magnificent, a Talent of ſilver ſhould be iſſued out of the Exchequer to provide Sacrifices and oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to be offered to this new Divinity.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, they ſtrained their invention to that degree of extravagance, that they changed the name of the Month of <note n="*" place="margin">January.</note> 
                  <hi>Muny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chion,</hi> and called it <hi>Demetrian,</hi> and the Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals

A ſtrange crop of Poiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Hemlock, a weed formerly an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Foreigner to that ſoil, ſprung up about the Altars which they had erected to thoſe new Divinities; they were forced alſo to intermit the ſolemn Feſtivals of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> for that upon the very day upon which they uſed to be annually celebrated there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſuch a ſevere and Rigorous froſt, that not only the Vines and Fig trees were all blaſted, but the very Wheat was periſhed with it; which gave occaſion to <hi>Philipides</hi> a declared Enemy to <hi>Stratocles,</hi> to abuſe him in theſe Comique Verſes.</p>

               <p>This <hi>Philipides</hi> was a perſon for whom King <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> had ſuch an extraordinary Value, that for his ſake he conferred many Royal favours upon the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and had ſuch, even a ſuperſtitious veneration for him, that when he was about to undertake any affair of great Importance, he ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted firſt with <hi>Philipides,</hi> and was uſed to ſay, that he always took his very preſence for a lucky <hi>Omen</hi> in his enterprizes. Nor was it altogether without reaſon that he thus eſteemed him, for <hi>Philipides</hi> was a perſon of an honeſt and divertive converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wholly free from the nauſeous humors of the ſervile and officious Courtiers; and as his humor was eaſie and innocent, ſo was it alſo gay and pleaſant, as may appear by this paſſage. <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> upon a certain time being extreamly obliged with his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Company, demanded of him, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipides,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>what will you that I ſhould gratifie you withal, and I will do it?

But that which exceeds all the former follies and flatteries was that of <hi>Dromoclides</hi> of <hi>Sphetus,</hi> who when there was a debate concerning ſending to the <hi>Delphian</hi> Oracle to enquire the lucky minute for the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of certain Bucklers, he propounded in the Aſſembly, that they ſhould rather ſend to conſult the Oracle of <hi>Demetrius;</hi> and for the horrible rarity of the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I will repeat the very words of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal Order, which was in theſe terms. <hi>May it be happy and propitious? The People of</hi> Athens <hi>have decreed and ordained, that a fit perſon ſhall be choſen among the</hi> Athenian <hi>Citizens, who ſhall be deputed to be ſent to our great</hi> Deliverer, <hi>and after he hath duly performed the juſt Rites and Sacrifices, ſhall enquire of him, in what most Religious and decent manner he will pleaſe to direct the Conſecration of the Bucklers; and according to the anſwer which his</hi> Oracleſhip <hi>ſhall be pleaſed to return, the People ſhall be obliged to put it in ſpeedy execution.</hi> Thus did theſe Officious flatterers, with their impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous breath, blow up poor <hi>Demetrius,</hi> alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy crazed with his ſucceſſes and honors, almoſt into a perfect pleuriſie and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who was naturally amorous in this interval of leiſure from his Martial affairs, became paſſionately in love with a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:36410:22"/>
fair <hi>Athenian</hi> Lady, whoſe name was <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice:</hi> She was deſcended of the ancient Houſe of <hi>Miltiades,</hi> that Celebrated Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and had been Married very young to <hi>Opheltas</hi> Prince of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> but having the misfortune to be divorced from him by his untimely Death, ſhe was not able to brook that Melancholy Court, but retired her ſelf to <hi>Athens,</hi> whence <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who was as fortunate at ſtorming the tender hearts of fair Ladies, as the Walls of the moſt obſtinate Cities, after a ſhort ſiege of Courtſhip overcame the difficulties and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions, with which ſhe defended her ſelf againſt ſecond Nuptials, and was Married to her. The <hi>Athenians</hi> took this Marriage for an extraordinary favour done to their City of which the Lady was a Native, when as in truth it was the effect of a Natural propenſion which he had to variety, for he had many Wives at the ſame time; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them all <hi>Philla</hi> was the Lady to whom he paid the moſt reſpect and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; ſhe was the Daughter of <hi>Antipater,</hi> and the Widow of <hi>Craterus,</hi> who while he lived was of all the Succeſſors of <hi>Alexander</hi> the moſt beloved, and at his death the moſt univerſally lamented by the <hi>Macedonians:</hi> And for theſe reaſons <hi>Antigonus</hi> had oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to Marry her, notwithſtanding the diſparity of their years, <hi>Demetrius</hi> being
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:36410:23"/>
much younger than that Princeſs; and when upon that account he made ſome difficulty of complying with his Father's pleaſure, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> whiſpered him ſoftly in his Ear this Couplet, alluding to thoſe verſes in <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides.</hi>
               </p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Let not her years your Love abate,</l>
                  <l>But Marry where's the beſt Eſtates.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>But as it frequently happens in ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Matches, how much reſpect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſoever <hi>Demetrius</hi> paid to her Birth, Quality and Fortune, <hi>Philla</hi> was never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely poſſeſſed of his heart; for beſides ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Ladies whom he married, he had always many Miſtreſſes, and was a Prince that ſurpaſſed all others of his time, in abandoning himſelf to the infamous ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his Paſſions, and unbounded plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
               <p>But he was not ſo abſolutely charmed with the ſoft Lute of <hi>Venus,</hi> but that he had ſtill an Ear for the ſhrill Notes of <hi>Bellona's</hi> Trumpet; and there happening at this time a new conteſt with King <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus, Antigonus</hi> ſent for him to command his Troops in that expedition; his unwillingneſs to abandon the glorious Enterprize of the deliverance of <hi>Greece,</hi> which he had ſo fortunately begun,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:36410:23"/>
did for ſome time ſtruggle with his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the King's command; and ſeeing that he could not at preſent effect his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign by the force of his Arms, he attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to accompliſh it by cunning and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: He ſent therefore to <hi>Cleonides, Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> Governour in <hi>Sicyone</hi> and <hi>Corinth,</hi> and privately made him very advantageous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, if he would only retire from thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and leave them at intire liberty: But <hi>Cleonides</hi> diſdainfully rejecting all ſorts of conditions, which might blemiſh his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with the infamy of ſo baſe a treachery to his Maſter, he was for that time forced to quit the proſecution of his deſigns in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and to apply himſelf to the War with <hi>Ptolomy:</hi> He therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked his Troops, and with a mighty Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy ſailed directly to the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where immediately upon his arrival, he fell upon <hi>Menelaus</hi> the Brother of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and gave him a notable defeat. The news of this affront ſo inraged <hi>Ptolomy</hi> that he came in perſon with all his Naval Power and Land forces, to revenge the diſgrace of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's overthrow.</p>
               <p>When both theſe Fleets were come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſight, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> having commanded his to drop their Anchors, he ſent this inſolent Meſſage to <hi>Demetrius, That if he conſulted his ſafety or honor, he would take this time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:36410:24"/>
advice, and inſtantly retire, before his whole Fleet and Land forces were come up, for that otherwiſe he would compel him to do it with ſhame and ignominy. Demetrius</hi> not in the leaſt ſhock'd by theſe impotent Menaces, returned him an anſwer more ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in appearance, but not leſs high and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. <hi>You may acquaint</hi> Ptolomy, ſaid he to the Meſſengers, <hi>that I will do him the favour to permit him to eſcape, if he will oblige himſelf upon his honor, to withdraw his Garriſons from</hi> Sicyone <hi>and</hi> Corinth, <hi>and make thoſe Cities poſſeſſors of their own Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The conteſt between theſe two potent Princes, and the iſſue of this War was ſuch, as had not only a ſingle influence upon themſelves, but muſt draw after it the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of many other Princes and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Lords; for it was apparent that he upon whom victory ſhould incline to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow her Lawrels, would thereby become not only Maſter of the Kingdoms of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> but moſt undoubtedly the moſt Potent and formidable Monarch of all the Succeſſors of <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fleets had not long lain within view of one another, but that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> reſolving to put it to the iſſue of a Combat, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereunto, having Commanded <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> who lay in the Port of <hi>Salamine</hi> with

ſixty Gallies, that in the heat of the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he ſhould attack the Rear of <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> his fleet, he inſtantly weighed, and with all the force of ſails, and Oars he aſſailed <hi>Demetrius</hi> with a fleet of one hundred Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, excellently well manned and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Combat. But <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who apprehended his deſign, commanded ten of his Gallies to row up to the very mouth of the Haven of <hi>Salamine,</hi> and there to place themſelves ſo advantageouſly, that <hi>Menelaus</hi> could neither come out with his fleet, nor be able to combat them, but upon equal numbers; and after this, having ranged his Land-Army upon the ſhoar, he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to meet <hi>Ptolomy</hi> with 180 Gallies; and attacked him with ſuch a furious impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, that in a little time he forced him with only eight of the lighteſt and moſt nimble Sailers in his Fleet, to ſave himſelf by flight; leaving <hi>Demetrius</hi> in ſo entire a poſſeſſion of the Victory, that 70 of his ſtouteſt Gallies were taken, and the reſt ſunk, together with all the Sea-men, Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, Victuallers, and the Gallions, which carried his Women, Friends, Officers, and principal Servants, his Treaſure, and all the Engines and Ammunition which he had provided for the War.</p>

                  <hi>Demetrius,</hi> the celebrated <hi>Lamia</hi> chanced to be one; a Lady, whoſe Beauty, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Skill upon the Lute, and charming Voice had rendred her extreamly admired; and after ſhe began to entertain much Courtſhip, ſhe ſtill increaſed in that infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous kind of Fame; and although ſhe was now paſt the Meridian-Glories of her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet had ſhe ſomething ſo agreeable in her Humour and Converſation, that <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> quickly exchanged his Liberty with her, and became a Priſoner to her Charms, to that degree, as that it was ſaid, <hi>All other Ladies were amorous of</hi> Demetrius, <hi>but</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius <hi>was amorous only of</hi> Lamia.</p>

To carry this happy News, <hi>Ariſtodemus</hi> of <hi>Miletus,</hi> the moſt affected Flatterer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Court, was diſpatched to <hi>Antigonus;</hi> and he, to enhaunce the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Meſſage, was reſolved to raiſe the expectation of <hi>Antigonus</hi> to the higheſt Pitch, by delaying his ſatisfaction to the lateſt moment: He therefore commanded the Frigat, which tranſported him, to come to an Anchor in the Road; and having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all the Ship's-Crew to remain aboard, he took the Long-Boat, and was ſet aſhore alone: One may well imagine the King was in great pain to know the Iſſue of this Encounter, and when he was informed, that <hi>Ariſtodemus</hi> was coming all alone, it put him into ſtrange Inquietudes and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, leſt he ſhould be charged with ſome fatal Tidings; his impatience growing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate, he ſent one Meſſenger after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to enquire what news; but <hi>Ariſtodemus,</hi> walking very gravely, and with a ſettled Countenance, without making any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſtill marched on ſoftly towards the Palace: <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who could not divine the meaning of this Delay, and no longer able to ſupport the eagerneſs of his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations, deſcended to the Gate of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, followed by a Train of inquiſitive Courtiers, and trembling, betwixt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie Combat of the Paſſions of Hope and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:36410:26"/>
Fear, he advanced to meet this Fantaſtick <hi>Envoy;</hi> as ſoon as <hi>Ariſtodemus</hi> ſaw him within hearing, ſtretching out his Hands, he accoſted him with this loud Exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Royal Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Rejoyce!

               <p>The Courtiers, who were extaſied with this good News, taking a ſudden Limit from this Appellation of <hi>Ariſtodemus,</hi> in great Pomp proclaimed <hi>Antigonus</hi> and <hi>Demetrius</hi> Kings, and immediately placed a Diadem upon the Head of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who ſent a rich Crown alſo to his Son; the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcription of the Letter which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it, being, <hi>To the moſt excellent Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of King</hi> Demetrius.</p>
               <p>This News arriving in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that they might not ſeem to be dejected with the late Defeat, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> alſo took occaſion to beſtow the Stile of King upon <hi>Ptolomy;</hi> and the reſt of the Succeſſors of <hi>Alexander,</hi> reſolving not to be behind-hand with them,

               <p>But this new addition of Honour was not confined only to the Name of King, or the Royal Ornaments, but ſeemed to inſpire them with ſuch haughty Sentiments, as in a manner changed their very Natures, and way of Living: for now they aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the former Familiarities towards their Friends, and in their very Mien, Gate, Salutations, and other Deportments, began to affect a ſupercilious State, and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Reſervedneſs, and Affectation of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur; appearing rather like formal Actors upon a Theatre, than thoſe eaſie, free, and obliging Perſons they were before; and to render themſelves more feared, they put on with the Royal Habit, a certain Cruelty to their Subjects, to whom the ſight of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments had formerly been very rare and unfrequent; but throwing away the Vizor
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:36410:27"/>
of Popularity, they now openly avowed themſelves abſolute Sovereigns. This Fear of their diſpleaſure begot the unmanly vice of Flattery among their Followers, the whole Court ſtriving who ſhould be moſt forward in theſe obſequious and mean com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances with theſe Humours, which, upon this Change they had taken up.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Antigonus,</hi> though now he was near the Eightieth Year of his Age, yet ſeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of the Fatigues of War, by the Bulk of his Body, (which, beſides that it was extraordinary, was alſo inclined to be corpulent) rather than by his Age, which was very green and vigorous at thoſe years; he therefore committed the management of his greateſt Affairs unto the Prince, whoſe Conduct was very admirably dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous in Military Matters; and the old King was induced to bear with thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Liberties, wherein he drowned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the time of Peace, becauſe he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to be the moſt temperate and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemious Perſon in the World in the time of War and Action.</p>
               <p>It happened, that returning one day from his Field-Exerciſes, and coming to the King, as his Cuſtom was, to kiſs him, and doing it with a little more than uſual warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>What!

this was the true Temper of this Prince, that to whatever he addicted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whether good or bad, he reſigned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wholly to it for that time; and not after the Cuſtom of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who, in the midſt of their Cups, were wont to call for their Arms, as it were, to awaken their Courage, ready to drop aſleep with their plentiful Glaſſes. As for <hi>Demetrius,</hi> if he devoted himſelf to his Pleaſures and Luxury, he abandoned himſelf entirely to them; and if the Trumpet ſounded to Horſe, he was no leſs aſſiduous in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of War; he was, beyond all doubt, a very great Captain, and moſt notably dextrous, not only in his Conduct, but in forming his Levies, and raiſing an Army, and in making all the neceſſary Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Stores and Magazines, the very Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles and Nerves of War, which he ever took care to provide in great abundance.</p>
               <p>His great Divertiſement was in building Gallies, and inventing Engines of War; and having naturally a Genius addicted to Mechanicks, he did not apply it to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of frivolous and unuſeful Toys, after the humour of ſome other Princes, who ſpent their vacant hours in Painting, Muſick, or Turning; as <hi>Aeropus</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> who took great pleaſure in making pretty little Lamps and Tablets;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:36410:29"/>
or, as <hi>Ptolomaeus Philometor,</hi> whoſe Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was to cultivate <hi>Hellebore, Henbane, Hemlock, Aconite, Dorichnium,</hi> and other noxious Plants, which he uſed to ſow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Royal Gardens, and with great diligence, to gather the Seeds in their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Fruits and Juices, and to try Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of their Natures, Qualities, and Virtues. The <hi>Parthian</hi> Kings employed themſelves ſomething better becoming their Dignity and Martial Humour; for their Diverſion was to ſharpen the Points of their Arrows, Darts, and Javelins. But the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick Inventions of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> though deſigned for Uſe and Service, had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing noble and magnificent withal; and the wondrous contrivance of them was ſo uncommon, that one might eaſily read the Character of a great Mind and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Spirit in the Princely Artifice; they were ſuch as by their magnificent and coſtly Structure, beſpoke themſelves the Products of a Royal Engineer, inſomuch that they did not leſs ſurprize his Friends with their ſtupendious Magnificence, than they did aſtoniſh his Enemies with their dreadful Beauty; and it is no leſs pleaſant than true, which is related of them, that the very Enemies againſt whom they were to be employed for their deſtruction, could not forbear running to gaze with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:36410:29"/>
upon his Gallies of five and ſix ranges of Oars, as they paſſed near their Coaſts; and the Inhabitants of thoſe Cities which were to be beſieged, and ſtormed by thoſe terrible Engines, could not forbear throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe Walls which they were about to batter, to ſatisfie their curioſity with the agreeable proſpect of thoſe ſtately Machines, which from their uſe were called deſtroyers of Cities. And even <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> of all the Kings of his time, the greateſt Enemy of <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> coming to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Solos</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> ſent to deſire the permiſſion to ſee his Gallies, and admirable Engines, which <hi>Demetrius</hi> eaſily accorded him, and having gratified his Curioſity by a full view of them, ſtruck at once with fear and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, he quitted the Place, and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of relieving the beſieged City. The <hi>Rhodians</hi> alſo, whom he had long beſieged, and at laſt reduced to compoſition, made their humble Requeſt, that he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſome one of theſe Engines upon them, which they might preſerve as a Monument of his Puiſſance, and their brave reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>The Quarrel betwixt him and the <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> was upon the occaſion of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Allies to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> whom they had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted againſt <hi>Demetrius;</hi> and in the Siege the greateſt of all the Engines was planted
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:36410:30"/>
againſt their Walls; the Baſis of it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly ſquare, each ſide containing twenty four yards; the height of it was thirty three yards, ſtill from the Baſis to the Top growing narrower, ſomething like a Cone or Pyramid; within it were ſeveral Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Chambers, which were to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with armed Men, and in every Story or Apartment, the Front towards the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had windows which were to be opened, in order to their diſcharging their Shot and Arrows againſt the Beſieged; but that which was moſt admirable, was, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the vaſt Bigneſs of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, yet, when it was moved, it never ſo much as once tottered, but went upon the Baſis with an equal poiſe, making a moſt dreadful noiſe as it was forced along, and thereby gave both Wonder and Terrour to the Spectators.</p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Demetrius</hi> was at this Siege, there were preſented unto him two compleat Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſes of poliſhed Steel, weighing each of them no more than forty pounds, and <hi>Zoilus,</hi> who had forged them, to ſhew the excellence of their Temper, deſired that one of them might be tried with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſhot out of one of the Engines at no greater diſtance than ſix and twenty yards; and upon the experiment, it was found, that though the Dart did exactly hit the Curaſs,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:36410:30"/>
yet it made no greater impreſſion, than ſuch a ſlight ſcratch as might be made with the point of a Style or Graver. <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who was wonderfully delghted with the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, having well rewarded the Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, himſelf wore one of them in all his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, and beſtowed the other upon <hi>Alcimus</hi> the <hi>Epirot,</hi> one of the moſt robuſt and gallant Captains in his Army: This <hi>Alcimus</hi> was one of the ſtrongeſt men in the World; for his compleat Armor weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſixſcore pound, whereas the Arms of the ableſt of the other Souldiers rarely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded half that weight; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his ſtrength and courage, no Armor was proof againſt his ill Deſtiny; for in a furious Attack, whilſt he was gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly fighting, and encouraging his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers by his example, he was flain near the Theatre during this Siege.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rhodians</hi> all the time made a brave Defence, in ſo much that <hi>Demetrius</hi> evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſaw he was not to maſter them without great difficulty and hazzard; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs he perſiſted in his Reſolution to try the laſt extremities: and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the <hi>Rhodians</hi> having taken a Veſſel in which there was inbarked cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rich Hangings for his Pavilion, Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and other Neceſſaries, as alſo the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the Princeſs <hi>Philla,</hi> who had ſent
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:36410:31"/>
them to him, they had undecently ſent them together with the Ship to <hi>Ptolomy;</hi> being herein far from imitating the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable example of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſurprized an Expreſs ſent from King <hi>Philip</hi> their Enemy, they opened all the Letters he was charged with, excepting only thoſe directed to Queen <hi>Olympia,</hi> which, with great Civility they ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken open to her. Notwithſtanding this Provocation, <hi>Demetrius,</hi> into whoſe power it ſhortly after came to have re-paid the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, would not ſuffer himſelf to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with revenge, ſo as to do a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Action, which he condemned in them; for it happened that the Deſign of the City of <hi>Jalyſus,</hi> which the celebrated <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togenes</hi> had been ſeven years painting, and wanted only the finiſhing ſtrokes, being ſurprized by his Souldiers in the Suburbs of the City, the <hi>Rhodians</hi> ſent a Herald at Arms, to requeſt of him, that he would be pleaſed to ſpare that rare Piece of Art and Curioſity; <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſent them in anſwer, that he would as ſoon permit the burning of the Picture of his dear Father and King, <hi>Antigonus,</hi> as ſuffer the leaſt injury to be done to ſuch a curious Piece of laborious Skill and Beauty. And ſo admirable was this Painting, that 'tis ſaid, when <hi>Apelles,</hi> that fam'd Maſter firſt ſaw it, he was ſo
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:36410:31"/>
ſurprized, that unable to ſtifle his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ſtood mute, ſtruck at once with wonder, and a little emulation at the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Work; but recovering his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and his tongue, <hi>A most admirable and marvellous Piece!</hi> ſaid he; <hi>but yet here want ſome of thoſe Sweetneſſes and ſoftning Touches which my Paintings have,</hi> of which he was wont to boaſt, <hi>That he painted for Eternity.</hi> This curious Piece, among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, was afterwards carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> where it was conſumed by an accidental Fire in that City.</p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Demetrius</hi> thus fruitleſly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Siege, and the <hi>Rhodians</hi> no leſs obſtinately defended their City, the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Ambaſſadors came luckily to reſcue his Reputation, by propoſing an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation between them, that ſo <hi>Demetrius</hi> might be at liberty to aſſiſt them againſt <hi>Caſſander,</hi> who had taken this opportunity to beſiege the City of <hi>Athens:</hi> In ſhort, a Peace was concluded, by which the <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> were obliged to aſſiſt <hi>Antigonus</hi> and <hi>Demetrius</hi> againſt all their Enemies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſo ſoon as the Ratifications were exchanged, <hi>Demetrius</hi> with a Fleet of 330 Gallies, and a great Land-Army, ſailed directly to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> where he not only preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodged <hi>Caſſander,</hi> but falling upon his Rear,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36410:32"/>
very much incommoded his Retreat, and purſuing him to the Straits of <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> obliged him there to a Battel, which ended in the total overthrow of <hi>Caſſander</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
               <p>After this Victory, he took in the City of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> the Citizens voluntarily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening their Gates to receive the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; and the Garriſon conſiſting of 6000 <hi>Macedonians,</hi> revolted to him, and took Service under his victorious Enſigns. In his Return, having given Liberty to all the <hi>Grecians</hi> on this ſide the Straits of <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mopylae;</hi> made an Alliance with the <hi>Baeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and taken in the Cities of <hi>Cenchrees, Phylen,</hi> and <hi>Panacton,</hi> in which <hi>Caſſander</hi> had placed ſtrong Garriſons to awe the Country into obedience, he beſtowed them upon the <hi>Athenians;</hi> and they, in requital, though they had before been ſo profuſe in beſtowing Honours upon him, that one would have thought they had exhauſted all the ſtore of Invention, yet ſtrained and put their Wits upon the Rack, to extort from them new deviſed Honours and Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries. They ordered him a Lodging be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Temple, in the Apartment of the Virgins, the vowed Votaries of that Goddeſs; upon which occaſion ſome of the Wits exerciſed their Talent, and took the Liberty to ſay, <hi>That</hi> Minerva <hi>had got a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36410:32"/>
dangerous</hi> Inmate, <hi>and that it was not much to the Reputation of her Virgins Chaſtity to keep company with</hi> Demetrius, <hi>who was not ſo over ſtrait-laced in that ſort of Vertue;</hi> though it ſeems <hi>Antigonus</hi> had not given him the Example; for of him it is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That one time, obſerving that his other Son <hi>Philip</hi> had Lodgings appointed in a Houſe where there were three pretty young Ladies, the King, without taking any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to his Son, ſent for the Officer who had taken up the Lodgings; to whom he ſaid, <hi>Pray, good Sir, oblige me with remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my Son out of thoſe little pent Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; for I do not care to have theſe young People crouded one upon another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Demetrius,</hi> he was ſo far from ſhewing any reverence to the Goddeſs, with whom he had taken up his Quarters, and whoſe younger Brother he had the vanity to have himſelf ſtiled, and upon that ſcore might have paid her ſome little decent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that he gave himſelf up to the moſt infamous Liberties; he debauched the young Women and ancient Matrons of the City of <hi>Athens,</hi> to that degree, as is as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the Reputation of a modeſt Pen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, as it was diſhonourable to the City; which may for ever bluſh at thoſe laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Liberties in which this diſſolute Prince, by their ſervile compliances, was not only
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36410:33"/>
permitted, but even tempted to debaſe both theirs, and his own Honour and Glory; in ſo much, that his Court ſeemed innocent, when he had only <hi>Chryſeis, Lamia, Dema, Anticyra,</hi> and ſome other Ladies of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ill Fame, for the Companions of his Revels.</p>
               <p>But among ſuch a heap of Vice, there was found one Jewel of ſevere Vertue and Chaſtity, whoſe Name deſerves to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Poſterity in the Records of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, the young <note n="*" place="margin">Hic quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que mut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi ſexum.</note> 
                  <hi>Damoclea;</hi> whoſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing Beauty gave her the particular Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the <hi>Fair Damoclea. Demetrius</hi> had eſſayed all the ways of paſſionate Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Gifts, Threatnings, and Flatteries, to make himſelf a paſſage into her Heart; but all in vain: Nay, ſhe grew ſo weary of his importunate Addreſſes, and repeated Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that ſhe declined all manner of publick Converſation, perfectly out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to avoid his diſdained Paſſion; but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a private Bath, and the laſcivious Prince being informed of it, he followed, and ſurprized her there: In this Diſtreſs, the innocent <hi>Damoclea</hi> taking counſel from Deſpair, and reſolving to ſecure her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, though with the loſs of her Life, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily throwing off the Cover of the Caul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, ſhe leap'd into the boiling Veſſel, and by that untimely Fate, becoming a Martyr
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:36410:33"/>
to her Vertue, purchaſed an Immortality of Fame and Glory.</p>
               <p>Some time after <hi>Demetrius</hi> had left <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, Cleonetus</hi> the Son of <hi>Cleomedon,</hi> made application to him, by his interceſſion, to procure that the Fine of fifty Talents, in which his Father had been condemned by the People of <hi>Athens,</hi> might be remitted; <hi>Demetrius</hi> gave him Letters to that effect; which, when he had produced at a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Counſel, it did not only diminiſh his Reputation, but ſtrangely ſhock'd the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens; who, though in compliance with the Letters, they remitted the Fine, yet they made an Edict, prohibiting any Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen for the future to endeavour the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Letters of the like Tenor from <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius;</hi> but being informed, that <hi>Demetrius,</hi> to whom an Account of it was carried, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it as an high Indignity and Affront, and that he gave out ſome paſſionate and menacing Words about it, theſe trembling Flatterers did not only reſcind and vacate the former Order, but inhumanely put ſome of the Propoſers and Adviſers of it to death, and baniſhed others; and to make up the Matter, it was in a full Aſſembly enacted and decreed, That whatſoever King <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſhould in time to come Ordain, ſhould be eſteemed ſacred and inviolable to the Gods and to Men: Upon which, when
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36410:34"/>
ſome of the beſt of the Citizens had ſaid, That certainly <hi>Stratocles</hi> muſt be ſtark mad, and out of his wits to make ſuch a horrid and impious Decree, <hi>Demochares,</hi> the <hi>Laconian</hi> replied, <hi>That if</hi> Stratocles <hi>had not been ſo mad, all the World muſt conclude him out of his Wits;</hi> thereby intimating what an advantageous Trade he made of this impious and ſervile Flattery; But <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mochares</hi> paid dearly for his Wit; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accuſed for it before the Criminal Judges, the People, who, as it muſt needs be where they govern, were not able to endure any thing leſs frantick than themſelves, they adjudged this honeſt Man to perpetual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile, for being in his Senſes, and making an unſeaſonable uſe of his Wit and Reaſon: This was the natural Reſult of their new regained Liberty, and the true Character of the Temper of a Popular State, which is only a Liberty for all Perſons to be Slaves to the wild, arbitrary, and extravagant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of a giddy, raſh, and inconſtant multitude of Fools, managed by a Set of more cunning Knaves.</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Demetrius</hi> marched with his Forces into <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> where the Terrour of his Victories had ſo benummed the Hearts and Hands of his Enemies, that not one of them had the courage to oppoſe the Torrent of his Arms; but before his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:36410:34"/>
abandoned all the Towns and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons which they were poſſeſſed of; ſo that he reduced all <hi>Arcadia</hi> under his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, except the Cities of <hi>Mantinea</hi> and <hi>Argos;</hi> he alſo by compoſition had <hi>Sicyon</hi> and <hi>Corinth</hi> ſurrendred unto him, paying to the reſpective Garriſons an hundred Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents.</p>
               <p>About this time it happened that the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Feſtivals of <hi>Juno</hi> were to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the accuſtomed Sports at <hi>Argos;</hi> and <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who was reſolved by aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at them, to render the Solemnity more ſplendid and magnificent, at his being there, fell in love with, and married the fair <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damia,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Eacus,</hi> King of the <hi>Moloſſians,</hi> and Siſter to <hi>Pyrrhus;</hi> which Nuptials did not a little contribute to the heightning of thoſe Solemnities and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments dedicated to <hi>Juno,</hi> the Goddeſs of Marriages: At the ſame time alſo, he prevailed with the <hi>Sicyonians</hi> to change the Situation of their City, to a place far more pleaſant and commodious, where they built a new one, and complemented him with giving it the Name of <hi>Demetriada;</hi> and in concluſion, his Affairs being conducted to this proſperous Iſſue, he ſummoned a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly of the <hi>Grecians</hi> to meet him at the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> in <hi>Peloponneſus;</hi> where, by an extraordinary concourſe of People, he
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:36410:35"/>
was with an unanimous conſent proclaimed Captain General of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> as before him <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great had been: And being blown up with the freſh Gales of his proſperous Fortune, he had the vanity to fanſie himſelf not only equal, but ſuperiour to thoſe two famous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Kings: In this indeed he out-did great <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf, who would never take upon him the Title of King of Kings, as did <hi>Demetrius,</hi> though many Kings paid Homage to him; nor did he ever go about to leſſen, or diveſt any of them who were his Tributaries, of the Stile of Kings; whereas <hi>Demetrius</hi> uſed to ridicule all thoſe who gave the Title of Kings to any of the Succeſſors of <hi>Alexander,</hi> except his Father and himſelf; and in his Entertainments, it was a common diverſion with him, after his own and Father's had paſſed round by the Name of Kings, to drink the Healths of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> with the Title of great Maſter of the Elephants; of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> by the Name of Lord High Admiral; of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimachus,</hi> with the Addition of Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer; and of <hi>Agathocles,</hi> by the Name of Governour of <hi>Sicily</hi> and the Iſlands. This vain Humour being reported to theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, gave none of them any other emotion, than that of deriding the inſolent Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances of <hi>Demetrius;</hi> only <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:36410:35"/>
it with deep indignation, it being in effect, to reproach him, as being an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch; ſuch being uſually then deputed to the Office of Treaſurers; which made <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimachus,</hi> who mortally hated him for this Indignity and Affront, reproach him with his Amours to <hi>Lamia;</hi> of whom he ſaid, <hi>That ſhe was indeed a pretty Stage-Queen, and acted her Part very admirably.</hi> Which, when it was told <hi>Demetrius,</hi> the Reflection touching him in a tender place: <hi>Well!</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I would have</hi> Lyſimachus <hi>know, that my Miſs is every whit as honeſt and vertuous as his</hi> Penelope.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, <hi>Demetrius</hi> being about to return to <hi>Athens,</hi> ſignified by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the City, that he had a deſire to be enrolled in the Fraternity of the Prieſts of <hi>Ceres,</hi> and his Requeſt was, That, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attending the time commonly allotted from the Initials, to the confirmation of thoſe admitted into that Order, he might at once be admitted to the uſual Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Myſteries which were to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed upon that occaſion: Now this was an Innovation abſolutely contrary to the Rules of the Foundation, and a thing which had never been allowed before; for from immemorial Antiquity the leſſer Myſteries were celebrated in the Month of <hi>November,</hi> and the great Solemnity in <hi>Auguſt</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:36410:36"/>
ſo that conſequently none of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices were admitted to the latter, till they had at leaſt ſpent an entire year in the ſtate of Probationer: Yet all this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, when, in the publick Aſſembly, theſe Letters of <hi>Demetrius</hi> were produced and read, there was not one ſingle Perſon, who had the courage to oppoſe them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Pythodorus</hi> the Prieſt, who was Torch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer in thoſe Solemnities; but it ſignified nothing; for <hi>Stratocles,</hi> who was always wickedly ingenious, propoſed as an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, that the Month of <hi>March,</hi> then cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, ſhould by Edict be taken and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be the Month of <hi>November;</hi> which being as ſoon agreed as offered, and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> thereby admitted to the leſſer Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; by another Vote, they turned the ſame Month of <hi>March</hi> into the Month of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> by which contrivance, <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> was alſo gratified with being an Actor in the Greater, and admitted to the moſt ſecret Myſteries of that Solemnity; which gave the Comoedian <hi>Philipides</hi> an occaſion to exerciſe his Wit upon <hi>Stratocles</hi> in this Couplet
<q>
                     <l>Prodigious Skill! how ſtrangely Flatt'ring Fear</l>
                     <l>Into one Month hath crowded all the Tear.</l>

Affliction to theſe fooliſh People; tho' the Story is variouſly reported; and ſome affirm, it was the <hi>Theſſalians,</hi> and not the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who were thus treated by him.

But the confident Woman having heard the Story, with the Effrontery of thoſe unbluſhing Brutes, commences a Suit againſt him, and lays her Action for ſo much Money as ſhe had demanded of him; alledging, it was but juſt that ſhe ſhould have ſatisfaction,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:36410:38"/>
ſince he confeſt he had had his Bargain: <hi>Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choris,</hi> who thought it the greateſt Juſtice to put an Affront upon ſuch Confidence, adviſed the Youth, to bring into the Court ſo much Money as ſhe had demanded, and to count it over, ſo as <hi>Thonis</hi> might hear the Noiſe; which being done accordingly, <hi>Miſtreſs,</hi> ſaid <hi>Bocchoris, you may go about your Buſineſs if you pleaſe, for you are paid in your own Coin, one Fancy being as good as another.</hi> But <hi>Lamia,</hi> who, it ſeems, would turn Advocate for one of her own Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, moved in Arreſt of Judgment, That the Sentence was no way equal, in regard, that the deſire which <hi>Thonis</hi> had to finger the Money, was in no ſort ſatisfied by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it chink, but rather increaſed; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, on the contrary, the Youth was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfied with the enjoyment of <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> in the Entertainment of his amorous Imaginations: But this is ſufficient to have related concerning <hi>Lamia,</hi> we muſt how return to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> whoſe Fortune, beginning to bend her Brows, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct us from the Comical, to the more Tragical Occurrences, and darker Scenes of his following Life.</p>
               <p>For now all theſe Kings whom he had diſobliged, or who were jealous of his growing Ambition and formidable Power, entred into a ſtrong Confederacy againſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:36410:39"/>
him and his Father, King <hi>Antigonus;</hi> and aſſembling their united ſtrength, <hi>Demetrius</hi> was conſtrained to abandon <hi>Greece,</hi> and to joyn with his Father, to weather the ſtorm which was gathering from all Quarters, and threatned to diſcharge its violence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Heads: <hi>Antigonus,</hi> upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this War, ſhewed a Courage and Fierceneſs much diſproportionate to his Years; he was a Prince of an undaunted Spirit; and could he but have preſerved a little Temper in his vain Ambition, in aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at an abſolute Sovereignty over others, he might in all probability, not only have continued in the firſt Rank of the Princes of his Age, but have left that Honour to his Deſcendants; but he was of a violent and haughty Spirit, much addicted to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue all other Princes, and to treat them both in his Words and Actions, more inſolently than was either conſiſtent with his Intereſt, his Prudence, or the Honour due to Kings; and though by this raſh freedom of his Language, he had drawn a moſt formidable Power of the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Princes againſt him; yet when he firſt heard of the Confederacy, he could not forbear deſpiſing the Confederates, by a Vanity peculiar to him: <hi>Oh!</hi> ſaid he, <hi>are they flocking? I'll make no more to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe them, than a Company of Rooks in a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:36410:39"/>
Corn-field, with throwing a Stone among them, and crying</hi> Huſh.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as the Troops which compoſed the Groſs of his Army could be brought together, <hi>Antigonus</hi> took the Field at the Head of ſeventy thouſand Foot, and ten thouſand Horſe, and ſeventy five Elephants. His Enemies were little inferiour to him in number of Men; for they had ſixty four thouſand Foot, and ten thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe; but they far ſurpaſſed him in Elephants, of which they brought four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred into the Field, and a hundred and twenty Chariots of War.</p>
               <p>When theſe two mighty Armies approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched near, there happened an odd kind of alteration in the Humour of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and though his Courage and Reſolution re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no great abatement; yet his Hope and Confidence ſeemed ſomething to flag and hang their Wings; for whereas former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there was wont to be a certain joyous Fierceneſs dwelling in his Eyes, that he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſpeak boldly and bravely, and even in his Encounters, to drop ſome witty Ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, to encourage his Souldiers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn their Enemies, he now became very thoughtful, ſilent, and retired: One Day above all the reſt, taking <hi>Demetrius</hi> along with him, he ſhewed him to the Captains, and the whole Army, which was drawn out
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:36410:40"/>
upon this occaſion, and recommended him to them, as his declared Succeſſor; theſe uncuſtomary Actions occaſioned ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration in thoſe who obſerved them; but that which increaſed the Wonder, was, that now he took <hi>Demetrius</hi> into his moſt ſecret Counſels; whereas formerly he never uſed to communicate his Deſigns to any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but when he had reſolved any thing, to give out his peremptory Commands for the execution; in ſo much that it is reported, that when <hi>Demetrius</hi> was a youth, he enquiring of the King, what time the Army ſhould decamp: He anſwered him in a little Paſſion, <hi>What do you trouble your ſelf? Are you the only Perſon that are afraid you ſhall not hear the Trumpet?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there were other very ominous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages beſides this Change in the Humour of <hi>Antigonus;</hi> which according to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of thoſe Times, abated the hopes and courage of the Army: For in his Dream, the Great <hi>Alexander,</hi> compleatly armed, ſeemed to appear to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and demanded of him, what <hi>Word</hi> they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give in the time of the Battel? And <hi>Demetrius</hi> anſwering, That he intended the <hi>Word</hi> ſhould be <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Victory:</hi> Well, then I ſee, ſaid <hi>Alexander,</hi> turning ſhort from him with an Air of Diſpleaſure, you have no Service for me, I will go over to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:36410:40"/>
your Enemies, who, I am aſſured will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain me with Joy. And the very Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Combat, as the Armies were drawing up, <hi>Antigonus</hi> going out of the door of his Tent, by ſome Accident or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſtumbled, ſo that he fell flat upon the Ground, and bruiſed himſelf very ſorely: this he, as well as others, took for no good Augury; and therefore, ſo ſoon as he had recovered his Feet, lifting up his Hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, <hi>O ye immortal Gods,</hi> cried he, <hi>if you ſo pleaſe, I beg a Victory from you this day; but if that cannot be granted, let me obtain the Favour of death at your hands, and that I may not live to bluſh to ſee my ſelf vanquiſhed, and with ſhame ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive my dying Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When theſe two great Armies had for ſome time faced one the other, the Signal being given, after whole Showers of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Arrows, which obſcured the very Sun, had been exchanged, as the firſt Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Death, they quickly came to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-blows; and <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the greateſt and beſt part of the Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, gave ſuch a furious Charge upon <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> the Son of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> that unable to endure the Shock, he and the Body which he commanded, turned their Backs and fled; and <hi>Demetrius,</hi> tranſported with the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, purſued them ſo eagerly, and ſo far,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:36410:41"/>
as that it fatally loſt him the Day; for, when perceiving his Errour, he would have come in to the aſſiſtance of his own Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he was not able, the Enemy with their Elephants having cut off his Retreat; and on the other hand, <hi>Seleucus</hi> obſerving the main Battel of <hi>Antigonus</hi> left naked of their Horſe, he made an Offer of charging them in Front; but then ſuddenly by wheeling about, as if he intended to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack them in the Flank and Rear, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by gave opportunity to thoſe among them, who had before reſolved it, perfidiouſly to revolt from <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and come over to his Party, as great numbers of them did; and this put the reſt into ſuch a conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no man knowing who were Friends, and who Enemies, that the whole Army was inſtantly put to the Rout. In this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing ſtate of his Affairs, the old King <hi>Antigonus</hi> ſtill kept his Poſt, and when a ſtrong Body of the Enemies drew up to charge him, one of thoſe about him, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, cried out to him, <hi>Sir, conſider with your ſelf what you will do; do you not ſee that Party which are coming down upon you;</hi> to which he only replied, <hi>And how ſhall they know me?</hi> Demetrius <hi>will come in to my reſcue and aſſiſtance.</hi> There was his laſt Hope: But alas! it was in vain; for after he had looked on every ſide to ſee if he
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:36410:41"/>
could perceive <hi>Demetrius</hi> coming to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, he was with a Storm of Arrows, Darts, &amp; Javelins, born down dead upon the earth; where being fallen, there remained with him, of all the numerous Company of his flattering Followers, not one to take care of his Body after his Death, beſides only <hi>Thorax</hi> of <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> the <hi>Theſſalian;</hi> thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this fatal Battel, and thus the Life of the unfortunate <hi>Antigonus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the unlucky event of this deciding Combat, the Kings, who had gained the Victory, tore all the Empire, which <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> and <hi>Demetrius</hi> before poſſeſſed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>to pieces, and ſhared thoſe large Territories among themſelves. As for the unfortunate <hi>Demetrius,</hi> he with five thouſand Foot, and four thouſand Horſe marched with great haſte to the City of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where being arrived, it was the common Opinion, that he would ſeize upon the Treaſures of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s Temple, to enable him to raiſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits, and put himſelf into a capacity, to arreſt the progreſs of his Enemies Arms, and endeavour to re-inſtate himſelf in his former Empire; but he was ſo far from that, that fearing leſt his Souldiers might be tempted to make ſome ſuch impious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, he haſted from thence, and embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſmall Remains of his Army; he ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>Athens;</hi> for there it was that he had
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:36410:42"/>
placed his greateſt hopes, having left there the beſt part of his Navy, his Treaſure, and Queen <hi>Deidamia;</hi> and from them he had not the leaſt doubt, but he ſhould in this his extremity find a ſeaſonable and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſiſtance. And conſidering what he had done for them, it is no wonder if <hi>Demetrius</hi> was exceedingly ſurprized, when at the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands of the <hi>Cyclades,</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors met him with this ingrateful Meſſage, that he muſt not think of a Retreat to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> for that the People had made a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, That no Crowned Head ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who had hitherto warded all the croſs-blows of Fortune with a dextrous Conſtancy, and marvellous height of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, was not able to bear this without Tranſports and Emotions: It was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him to reflect upon his former Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to them, or without the moſt ſenſible reſentment and diſpleaſure, to find all thoſe Applauſes and Honours, with which they had oppreſſed him in his more proſperous Eſtate, ſo falſe and treacherous, as that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his laſt Hopes, and reaſonable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectances, they ſhould ſo baſely deſert him in this important Turn of Affairs; and from thence he drew a clear Inference,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:36410:42"/>
                  <hi>That there can be nothing more uncertain than the Judgement that is drawn of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of Princes and Potentates, from the aery Honours, and ſervile Flatteries of a Populace; ſince it is difficult if not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to determine, whether thoſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary heats of popular favour, are effects of their Inclinations, with reſpect to the vertue and merit, or of their Fears of the Power of Great and Proſperous Princes; and that the People are equally tranſported into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, both by Fear and Love.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Judicious Princes are wiſely accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, not to value themſelves ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the erecting of Statues, Triumphant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or paying even Divine Honours to them, as upon the Foundation of their own juſt Actions and Deportment, being aſſured, that as nothing is more common than for the unconſtant multitude to hate exceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe, who receive immoderate Honors from them, even then when they ſeem moſt willingly to beſtow them.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who found himſelf at that time not in a Condition to revenge the affront, cunningly diſſembled his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and only gently expoſtulated the matter with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> by his Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, deſiring them, that ſince they would not permit him the Favour of coming to their City, that at leaſt they would be ſo
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:36410:43"/>
kind to ſend him his Gallies, among which there was one of thirteen Ranges of Oars: and this being accorded him, he ſailed to the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> and finding his affairs in very ill condition, his Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being either taken, or revolted to the Enemy, he left <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> to attend the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Greece,</hi> and took his courſe into <hi>Cherſoneſus,</hi> where he ravaged the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> and by the Booty which he took, both maintained and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented his ſhattered Troops, nor did any of the other Princes once go about to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach his enterprize on that ſide; for <hi>Lyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi> had as little reaſon to be beloved for his virtue, and as much to be feared for his Power, as <hi>Demetrius;</hi> and they were very well ſatisfied to be Spectators to ſee them leſſen one the other.</p>
               <p>In the midſt of theſe tranſactions, <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> ſent Embaſſadors to treat with <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> for a Marriage betwixt himſelf and the Fair <hi>Stratonice,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> by the Princeſs <hi>Philla:</hi> It is true, that <hi>Seleucus</hi> had already a Son by <hi>Apamia</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> Lady, whoſe name was <hi>Antiochus,</hi> but it was alſo true, that he was poſſeſſed of ſo many ſpacious Territories, as might well ſatisfie the ambition of more than one Succeſſor; and that which the rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to this Alliance with <hi>Demetrius,</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:36410:43"/>
was that <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> to ſtrengthen his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances, had married himſelf to one Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of King <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and his Son <hi>Agatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> to another. <hi>Demetrius</hi> who looked upon the offer, as an unexpected piece of good Fortune, preſently imbarked Himſelf and Daughter, and with his whole Fleet ſailed directly for <hi>Syria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During this Voyage he was often obliged to touch upon ſeveral Coaſts, for the benefit of Proviſions and freſh Water, and among other places in <hi>Cilicia;</hi> which by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionment of the Kings, after the defeat of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> was allotted to <hi>Pliſtarchus</hi> the Brother of <hi>Caſſander: Pliſtarchus,</hi> who took this Deſcent of <hi>Demetrius</hi> upon his Coaſts as an infraction of the mutual Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty betwixt the Confederate Princes, poſted away to <hi>Caſſander,</hi> to oblige him to expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulate the matter with <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and to know the Reaſon, why he had entred into amity with <hi>Demetrius</hi> the common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, without firſt acquainting the other Confederates with his intention. <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> receiving information of this, laid hold of the opportunity of his abſence, and ſuddenly, tacking about, fell upon the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Quindon,</hi> and ſurprized it, and in it a thouſand two hundred Talents being part of the Treaſure, which had been taken in the Battel from his Father <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and

               <p>He was ſcarcely come to an Anchor on the Coaſt of <hi>Syria,</hi> before he was met by his Queen <hi>Philla,</hi> the Mother of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Bride; and immediately after they landed, and were all received by <hi>Seleucus</hi> at the City of <hi>Oroſſus,</hi> with all the innocent Freedom and Royal Gallantry imaginable: firſt <hi>Seleucus</hi> treated <hi>Demetrius</hi> and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue aſhore, in a ſtately Pavilion in his Camp; and then <hi>Demetrius</hi> entertained his new Son-in-Law, in a moſt ſplendid man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner aboard the Admiral Gally, the then Wonder of the Seas: all theſe viſits were made to ſhew their mutual confidence, without all manner of armed attendants; and the Solemnity was continued for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days, until at length <hi>Seleucus</hi> took his leave, and conducted the fair <hi>Stratonice,</hi> to the City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> where they were wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed with all the ſtate and ſolemnity ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuch an occaſion.</p>

incommodiouſneſs of that paſſage, which was too rough for ſo delicate and tender a conſtitution, ſhe contracted an indiſpoſition, whereof ſhe ſhortly died.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:36410:45"/>
his affluence he wants that contentment and moderation of his deſires, which only can render any Perſon Rich and Happy.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Demetrius</hi> whoſe courage was not ſunk with his Fortune, reſolutely ſent him this anſwer, that though he were to be vanquiſh'd a thouſand times over again, he would never purchaſe the friendſhip of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus</hi> at ſo tame a rate; and therefore to ſecure them againſt his attempts, he rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced thoſe ſtrong Cities with ſufficient Garriſons, and all manner of Warlike ſtores, to enable them to make a brave defence againſt <hi>Seleucus,</hi> if his inſatiable ambition ſhould tempt him to attack them. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken care of theſe important Places, and receiving information, that one <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charis,</hi> taking the opportunity of their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Diſſentions, had ſet up himſelf as an Uſurper over the <hi>Athenians,</hi> he imagined, that if he made a ſudden attempt upon the City, he might now reduce it to his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and therefore with great diligence he ſailed with a powerful Navy towards <hi>Greece:</hi> But Fortune, who was now grown very uncourtly to him, treated him with ſo rough a tempeſt, juſt when he came upon the Coaſt, that he loſt divers of his Veſſels, and a great number of Soldiers which were aboard them. As for himſelf he eſcap'd, and began to make a little kind
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:36410:45"/>
of War with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> but finding himſelf unable to effect his deſign, he ſent to aſſemble the reſt of his Fleet and Forces, which had been diſperſed by the late ſtorm, and with thoſe Troops which he had he marched and laid Siege to the City of <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſena.</hi> While he lay before this place, he ran one of the greateſt dangers of his whole life, for in making an attack upon the Turn, an arrow from an <hi>Engine</hi> ſtruck him full in the mouth, and paſſed clear through his jaw; but by the skill and care of his Chirurgeons, it was not long before it was healed; and as ſoon as he was in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to take the Field, he regained divers Cities which had revolted from him, and made an incurſion into the Territories of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> where he took <hi>Eleuſina</hi> and <hi>Rhamnus,</hi> and waſted all the whole Country thereabout. And that he might ſtraiten the <hi>Athenians</hi> by cutting off all manner of Proviſion, a Veſſel laden with Corn bound thither, falling into his hands, he ordered the Maſter and Merchant who had freight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to be immediately hanged, thereby to ſtrike a terror into others, that ſo they might not adventure to ſupply the City with Proviſions; by which means they were reduced to ſuch extremities that a buſhel of ſalt was worth forty drachma's of Silver, and a buſhel of wheat was ſold at
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:36410:46"/>
the exceſſive Rate of three hundred. In this diſtreſs, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> had ſent to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief an hundred and fifty Gallies, which came ſo near as to anchor before <hi>Egina,</hi> but this ſhort blaze of hope was ſoon extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the arrival of three hundred ſail which came to the aſſiſtance of <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> from <hi>Cyprus, Peloponneſus,</hi> and other places, which ſtruck ſuch a pannick fear into the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that they cut and ſlipp'd their Anchors, and with Sails and Oars ſtood away for <hi>Egypt;</hi> which the Tyrant <hi>Lacharis</hi> underſtanding, he inſtantly quitted the City in order to his own ſafety and preſervation.</p>
               <p>And now the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who, before by a Popular Edict, had made it Capital for any perſon ſo much as to propoſe a treaty, or accommodation with <hi>Demetrius,</hi> were compelled to ſend Embaſſadors to him, not ſo much out of hopes of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any honorable Conditions from his Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, as out of pure neceſſity, and to avoid a lingring Death by Famine, a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Enemy, which they were not able to reſiſt; for this imperious Tyrant had reduced them to thoſe extremities, that there happened many odd adventures du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of the Siege, the effects of his irreſiſtible Power: among which this ſtory is very remarkable, That one day, a Father
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:36410:46"/>
with his Son, ſitting diſconſolately in their Houſe, lamenting their deplorable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which had not left them any thing to ſuſtain their lives, a dead Rat happened to drop from the Cieling between them; whereupon they immediate fell into a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſcuffle, which of them ſhould have the veniſon for his dinner: And in this Famine, the Philoſopher <hi>Epicurus,</hi> ſo celebrated for indulging his appetite, was forced to ſave his own, and the lives of his Scholars, by a ſmall quantity of Beans, which by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were every day diſtributed to them.</p>
               <p>In this miſerable condition was the City when <hi>Demetrius</hi> made his publick En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and he was no ſooner poſſeſſed of the Place, but he made Proclamation, that all the Inhabitants ſhould inſtantly aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the publick <hi>Theatre,</hi> which being done he ſurrounded them with his Armed Troops, ſetting alſo a ſtrong Guard about the Stage. This adminiſtred no ſmall ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and perplexity to the amazed People, who looked for nothing leſs than a Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Executions; but it was not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he diſſipated thoſe Fears, for entring the Stage in Perſon by the paſſage through which the Actors uſed to enter, he made an Oration to them, wherein he only gently reprehended their former ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him, but withal told them, that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:36410:47"/>
he would receive them again into his grace and favour: And that it might appear his intentions were real, he beſtowed amongſt them the welcome Donative of a hundred thouſand Buſhels of Wheat; and to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate himſelf the more, he promoted ſuch Perſons into the Offices of the Magiſtracy as he knew to be moſt agreeable to the People; ſo that nothing now was heard but loud acclamations of joy among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and the Stages reſounded with ſpeeches in the praiſe of <hi>Demetrius;</hi> all the celebrated Orators of the City vying with one another in commendation of his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity; and upon this occaſion the Orator <hi>Dromoclides</hi> propoſed a Decree, that the Port of <hi>Pyneum,</hi> and the ſtrong Cittadel of <hi>Munychia,</hi> might be put into the power of <hi>Demetrius</hi> to uſe them at his own diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was no ſooner offered than paſſed by unanimous ſuffrage of the People, and <hi>Demetrius</hi> having put ſtrong Garriſons into thoſe two places, by his own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity placed another in the <hi>Muſeum,</hi> to the end that thoſe People, who had ſhewed ſo much levity in their diſpoſitions, might be kept in ſubjection, and not by their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture perfidies be able to divert him from the proſecution of his other enterprizes.</p>
               <p>He had not been long Maſter of <hi>Athens</hi> before he had formed a Deſign againſt the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:36410:47"/>
                  <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> of which <hi>Archidamus</hi> their King being advertiſed, he to prevent it, drew out an Army and marched againſt <hi>Demetrius;</hi> but in this wiſe Method of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying War out of his own Territories, he had not Fortune anſwerable to his Courage, for he was overthrown in a Battel near the City <hi>Mantinea;</hi> and <hi>Demetrius</hi> following his blow entred the <hi>Laconian</hi> Confines, and in a ſecond Battel defeated him almoſt within view of the City of <hi>Sparta,</hi> wherein two hundred <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> were ſlain, and five hundred taken Priſoners; and now it was eſteemed almoſt impoſſible, for the Virgin City of <hi>Sparta,</hi> which hitherto had never ſubmitted to a Conqueror, to eſcape being raviſhed by his victorious Arms. But certainly, there never was any Prince, upon whom Fortune made ſuch ſhort turns, mounting him to the Pinacles of Hope and Glory, from thence to precipitate him into the utmoſt deſpair and miſery: To day he would be great and potent, to morrow weak and broken, even almoſt beyond the relief of Hopes or Miracles, which made him ſometimes in the low Ebb of his adverſe condition reproach that inconſtant Goddeſs with theſe verſes of the Poet <hi>Aeſchilus,</hi>

Whereupon <hi>Eraſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus</hi> taking him by the hand, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>You have then no need of the aſſiſtance of</hi> Eraſiſtratus, <hi>for you, who are a Husband, a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:36410:52"/>
Father, and a King, are the most proper and in this caſe only Phyſician for your own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, 'tis you only that can recover the life of Prince</hi> Antiochus, <hi>by refigning to him</hi> Stratonice, <hi>for that's his Diſeaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon <hi>Seleucus,</hi> inſtantly ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Counſel of all his great Officers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto them the ſtate of this Affair, and that he was reſolved to beſtow <hi>Stratonice</hi> upon the Prince, and to create him King, and her the Queen of all the Provinces of the Higher <hi>Aſia;</hi> telling them, that he thought he had ſo abſolute a Power over the Prince's will, that he hoped he ſhould find in him no repugnance to obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; and for the Queen he hoped all his Friends would endeavour to make her ſenſible, if ſhe manifeſted any reluctancy to this Marriage, that ſhe ought to eſteem thoſe things juſt and honorable, which were ſo abſolutely neceſſary to the general and publick Good. And by theſe Arguments, <hi>Stratonice</hi> was perſwaded to this ſecond Marriage, which quickly reſtored the health of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and was celebrated with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Joy and Solemnity.</p>
               <p>But to return to the affairs of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> he having obtained the Crown of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and being poſſeſſed of <hi>Theſſalia,</hi> and the greateſt part of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> the Cities of <hi>Megara</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> the two Keys of the

               </p>
               <p>It happened, not long after, that <hi>Lyſima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> had the misfortune to be taken Priſoner by <hi>Dromichaetes,</hi> whereupon <hi>Demetrius</hi> haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Army into <hi>Thracia,</hi> in hopes that in the diſorder, into which this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:36410:53"/>
muſt have put the affairs of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, he might find an opportunity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs himſelf of it; but <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly regaining his Liberty, and the newly conquered <hi>Baeotians,</hi> breaking out into a general Revolt, he was obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire with his Army, and in great haſt, to look after his own affairs at home. Upon his return he found that his Son <hi>Antigonus</hi> had in a Battel defeated the Forces of the <hi>Baeotians,</hi> and therefore he preſently laid Siege to <hi>Thebes,</hi> whither they had retreated with their broken Troops; but underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> had made an incurſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> and that he was advanced as far as <hi>Thermopylon,</hi> leaving <hi>Antigonus</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Siege, he marched with the reſt of his Army to oppoſe the King of <hi>Epyrus;</hi> But <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> gave him no occaſion to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his Courage; for upon the firſt news of his approach, he made a very haſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat out of the Country, whereupon <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> leaving ten thouſand foot and a thouſand horſe for the Guard of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> he returned to the Siege of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and there he brought his dreadful Engine in order to ſtorm the City, but by reaſon of its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy Bulk, and the unevenneſs of the Ground, it was moved with ſuch labour and difficulty, that in two Months, it did not advance two furlongs; In the mean
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:36410:54"/>
time the Citizens made a ſtout defence, and <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who was reſolute to be revenged on them for their Perfidy, obſtinately main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Siege, and expoſed himſelf and his Soldiers to very hard and dangerous Service, inſomuch that <hi>Antigonus,</hi> obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that many gallant Men daily loſt their lives, being ſenſibly mov'd with pity, he addreſſed himſelf to the King his Father, and finding him as he thought in good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I beſeech your Majeſty, what reaſon is there to expoſe ſo many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Men to ſuch continual danger, without a greater neceſſity, when</hi>—But <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> in a great paſſion, without permitting him to proceed; <hi>And you, good Sir, why do you afflict yourſelf for this Matter, the more there are kill'd, the fewer there will be for you to make a proviſion for.</hi> But that the Soldiers might ſee he valued his own life at no dearer rate than theirs, he expoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the ſame dangers to which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them; and in a deſperate attack, which he one day made, he was wounded with a Javelin, which ſtruck quite through his neck, and put him into very great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of his life; but notwithſtanding his illneſs he continued the Siege, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion took the Town; and after his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, when the Citizens expected all the ſeverities which an incenſed Conqueror
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:36410:54"/>
could inflict, he only put to death thirteen of the Capital Rebels, and baniſhed ſome few others, graciouſly pardoning all the reſt: Thus the City of <hi>Thebes</hi> after it had been ſo long raiſed from its ruins, was twice taken in the ſpace of thoſe ten years.</p>
               <p>Shortly after, the Feſtivals of the <hi>Pythian Apollo,</hi> being to be celebrated, and the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolians,</hi> having blocked up all the paſſages to <hi>Delphos, Demetrius</hi> cauſed them to be kept at <hi>Athens,</hi> alledging it was great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thoſe Honours ſhould be paid to <hi>Apollo</hi> in that place, both in regard he was the Tutelar Divinity of that City, and that the <hi>Athenians</hi> pretended to derive from him their Original and Pedigree.</p>
               <p>From thence <hi>Demetrius</hi> returned to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> and being not only of a reſtleſs tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per himſelf, but conſidering the Genius of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who were ever the beſt Subjects when imployed in military expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, but ſeditiouſly buſie and deſirous of change in the idleneſs of Peace; he led them againſt the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and having waſted their Country, he left <hi>Pantanchus,</hi> with a great part of his Army to perfect the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and with the reſt he marched in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to find out <hi>Pyrrhus;</hi> but ſo it fell out, that by taking different ways, theſe two Armies did not meet, but whileſt <hi>Demetrius</hi> entred <hi>Epyrus,</hi> and laid all waſt before him,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:36410:55"/>
                  <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> at the ſame time encountred <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanchus,</hi> where in the heat of the Combat, the two Chief Commanders, meeting, bountifully entertained one the other with the Complements of their Swords, till their Arms bluſhed at that kind of rude Civility, but in concluſion Victory perched upon the Standards of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who beſides great numbers ſlain upon the place, took five thouſand Priſoners.</p>
               <p>This blow would not have been ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable as to have given <hi>Demetrius</hi> any great hurt, had it not been, that <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> by his brave and fierce deportment in this encounter, did not only win the Glory of the Field, but the hearts of the inconſtant <hi>Macedonians;</hi> for now they began loudly to proclaim, that they ſaw in him the very picture of the hardy Courage and perſonal bravery of their adored <hi>Alexander;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the other Kings his Succeſſors, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Demetrius,</hi> they ſaid, reſembled him in nothing ſo much as in his extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant humors and haughty vanity: And to ſay nothing but truth, <hi>Demetrius</hi> was ſomething ſo affected in his Garb, as too nearly related to the Pageantry of the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre. For not only his Body was uſed to be clothed with the moſt exquiſite travels of the needle in Gold and Purple Robes, and his Head incircled with the uncommon
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:36410:55"/>
novelty of a double Diadem, but even his Shooes were made of curiouſly embroider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Purple with Golden ſoles: And ſuch was the profuſe vanity of this Prince, that he had commanded a Robe to be made for him, wherein with proud Art, there was to be wrought the Repreſentation of the Univerſe, Sea and Land, the Celeſtial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Figures of the Sun, with all his Golden Glories, and the Silver Moon, and the ſparkling Courtiers of the Night, which were to be imitated with the richeſt Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds that could be procured. But the reverſe of his more gloomy Fortune over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking him, the work was never finiſhed; but as it was, it was long preſerved as a Monument of his magnificent vanity: Not any of the Kings of <hi>Macedon</hi> his Succeſſors, though reported divers of them to be haughty enough, arriving to that degree of Pride, to have it finiſhed, or to adventure to wear it.</p>
               <p>But it was not this outward Garb and Pomp alone which diſguſted the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> but his profuſe and diſſolute Way of living; and above all the difficulty of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to his preſence was extremely diſobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging: For either he would not be ſeen at all by ſuch as attended long for diſpatch of their affairs, or if he permitted them to come before him, he would treat them
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:36410:56"/>
roughly and with diſreſpect; nor were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly private Perſons thus uſed by him, but even ſuch Miniſters as negotiated publick affairs: Thus he made the <hi>Athenian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, to whom yet he was more civil than to all the other <hi>Graecians,</hi> attend two years in his Court, before they could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an Audience from him; at another time when the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> ſent a ſingle Perſon on an Embaſſy to him, thinking it was done in contempt, in great indignation he demanded of him, <hi>Whether the</hi> Spartans <hi>had but one Man that was fit to be ſent upon an Embaſſy, ſince they ſent no more?</hi> To whom the Embaſſador according to the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conian</hi> mode, tartly replied; <hi>Sure one Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador is enough to ſend to one King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It chanced one time that an humor took him to be a little more than ordinarily Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, and therefore going abroad, he was immediately accoſted by a multitude of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Petitioners; he very courteouſly received their Supplications, and put up their Petitions in the skirt of his Robe, the poor People over-joyed at this unuſual Grace and Favour followed him cloſe, in hopes to be preſently diſpatched in their ſuits; but when he came upon the Bridge of the River <hi>Axius,</hi> opening his lap, he drop'd all the Petitions into the River. This action did ſtrangely exaſperate the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians,</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:36410:56"/>
who ſeeing their Hopes and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions both drowned, looked upon it as a very injurious and unkingly Frolick; and this brought to their remembrance, what ſome of them had ſeen, and others had heard related of King <hi>Philip,</hi> who by a pretty accident was reclaimed from this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging humor; for King <hi>Philip</hi> being one day abroad, an old Woman made her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to him with a Petition, the King told her, he could not then diſpatch her, in regard he had affairs of greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance upon his hands; to which the old Woman in a pet replied, <hi>What! greater than doing Juſtice? if you refuſe to do Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, pray lay aſide your Royalty, and leave being a King.</hi> This ſharp reprimand ſo nettled the King, that returning to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and ſetting all other matters apart, for ſeveral days together he did nothing elſe, but receive the complaints of all that would come, and redreſſed their real grievances, to the general contentment and ſatisfaction of his People.</p>
               <p>And certainly there is no other vertue more commendable or popular in a Prince, than Juſtice; which made <hi>Timotheus</hi> ſay that <hi>Mars</hi> is a great Tyrant, but Law, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the incomparable <hi>Pindar,</hi> is the moſt Glorious Queen of the Univerſe. And upon this ſubject, <hi>Homer,</hi> the Prince of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:36410:57"/>
Poets, obſerves, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> did not beſtow upon Kings, terrible Engines or Ships of War for the deſtruction of Cities, but had committed the Oracles of Law and Juſtice to their Cuſtody in order to their good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Preſervation, and that the moſt juſt Princes, and not the fierce and violent were the Genuine Offspring of the Gods. But <hi>Demetrius</hi> was not at all ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous of the Title of ſuch a King as refem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Gods; for diſdaining the appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Polieus,</hi> or <hi>Polioukos,</hi> the Tutelary preſerver of Cities, he rather affected the Name of <hi>Poliorcetes,</hi> the Deſtroyer of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. By his affected folly miſtaking the very nature of vice and vertue, placing his glory in injuſtice, and eſteeming baſe and ungenerous actions, as if they had been the laudable Ornaments of a vertuous Prince.</p>
               <p>But to return to the hiſtorical purſuit of his life, <hi>Demetrius</hi> being at <hi>Pella,</hi> fell into a deſperate malady, the true daughter of Intemperance and Luxury; and while he lay ſtrugling with the violence of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> laying hold of this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, took from him the greateſt part of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and advanced as far as the City of <hi>Edeſſa.</hi> But <hi>Demetrius</hi> recovering his health, quickly recovered from him his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions alſo, and obliged <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:36410:57"/>
himſelf with his own Kingdom. And that he might not imploy his whole time in theſe little conflicts with a neighbour, his thoughts being fixed upon another deſign from which he was unwilling to be diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this petty War, he concluded a Peace with <hi>Pyrrhus.</hi> For now he had formed a deſign to endeavour the recovery of the whole Empire which his Father had poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and his preparations were every way ſuitable to his aſpiring Hopes, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Enterprize. He gave out Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions for the levying of ninety eight thouſand Foot, and twelve thouſand Horſe; and orders for the building and rigging out a Fleet of five hundred Gallies; ſome to be built at <hi>Athens,</hi> others at <hi>Corinth, Chalc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s</hi> and <hi>Pella.</hi> And ſo aſſiduous and diligent was he, in the forwarding of theſe vaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, that he was continually poſting from place to place, to give advice and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to the Carpenters and Artificers for the building them, more ſtrong and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: And herein he was ſo great a Maſter, that the Artizans themſelves, as well as all others, were amazed, not ſo much at the number, as at the ſtupendious bulk and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of this extraordinary Navy; for hitherto there had never been ſeen a Gally with fifteen or ſixteen ranges of Oars. It is true, that afterwards <hi>Ptolomy Philopater</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:36410:58"/>
built a prodigious Gally of eighty Rows of Oars, which was two hundred and eighty Cubits in length, and the height of her from the Water to the top of her ſtern was forty eight Cubits, ſhe had four hundred Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and four thouſand Rowers, and beſides there was convenient ſtanding for very near three thouſand Soldiers to fight above the Decks. But this unwieldy Hulk after all this, was only fit for ſhew, and not for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for ſhe looked like an immovable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle upon the Water, and was not to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without extreme toil and peril; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as theſe Gallies of <hi>Demetrius</hi> were not the leſs ſerviceable for their magnificence, but notwithſtanding their beauty and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, were as light and nimble, as they were extraordinary and ſumptuous.</p>
               <p>The noiſe and ſtorm of theſe great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations; the like whereof had never been made ſince the expedition of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, threatning to fall upon <hi>Aſia,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened <hi>Seleucus, Ptolomy,</hi> and <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> to look to themſelves, which obliged them to enter into a confederacy for their mutual defence and ſecurity: They therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched Embaſſadors to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to him the neceſſity of rejecting the peace he had made which <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and to perſwade him to give him a deverſion, by
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:36410:58"/>
making an incurſion into <hi>Macedon;</hi> for that <hi>Demetrius</hi> had only concluded the late Peace with him, to be at liberty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute his greater Deſigns, and that ſhould he become victorious, he would too late be ſenſible of the danger of ſo potent a Neighbour. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> finding Reaſon in the Propoſition, preſently cloſed with them; ſo that in an inſtant <hi>Ptolomy</hi> with a mighty Navy invaded <hi>Greece; Lyſimachus</hi> entred <hi>Macedon</hi> upon the ſide of <hi>Thracia,</hi> and <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> fell in upon that part next to <hi>Epirus,</hi> ſpoiling and waſting the whole Country. This was an unexpected Surprize to <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius;</hi> but however, leaving his Son <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> to look after the Affairs of <hi>Greece,</hi> he marched in great diligence to the relief of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and to oppoſe <hi>Lyſimachus:</hi> He was no ſooner arrived near the Frontier, but he received the ill News that <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> had taken the City <hi>Beraea;</hi> and the Report being once gotten among the Souldiers, the whole Camp was filled with Diſorders and Confuſion, Cries and Lamentations; the Souldiers grew inſolent and mutinous, and beſtowing a thouſand Execrations upon <hi>Demetrius,</hi> they openly declared, that they would march home to take Care of their Country, Friends, and Families; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality the Deſign was to revolt to <hi>Lyſima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</hi>

                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> finding them in theſe Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, reſolved to remove further from <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimachus;</hi> for he judged, that though by reaſon of their former kindneſs to that Prince, under whoſe Conduct many of them had ſerved in the Wars of <hi>Alexander,</hi> might make them unwilling to combat with him; yet they would make no difficulty to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> a Foreigner and Invader, who had ſpoiled their Country; but he found himſelf under great Miſtakes in theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures: for when he was advanced near to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> theſe Mutineers took occaſion to extoll the Gallantry and Courage of <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus,</hi> his generous uſage of thoſe who had been his Priſoners, and to declare, that the Kingdom by the fundamental Cuſtom, the Law of Antiquity ought to devolve upon the braveſt Man; and in ſhort, to meditate a general Defection and Revolt: For at firſt, ſome ſtragling Parties only deſerted, but in a little time the whole Army broke out into an univerſal Mutiny; inſomuch that ſome of them inſolently told him, that if he conſulted his own Safety, he were beſt to make haſte to be gone; for that the <hi>Macedonians</hi> were reſolved no longer to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their Lives, to combat for the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his Luxury and Ambition; theſe were moderate Reproaches in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome others which he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

               <p>And certainly this changeable.

time, by the coming of divers Troops to his aſſiſtance, which gave him encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to hope for the re-eſtabliſhment of his Affairs: He had not however, ſince his laſt diſgrace, re-aſſumed the Royal Robe; whereupon a certain <hi>Theban,</hi> ſeeing him in the mean habit of a private Perſon, applied to him the Diſtich of <hi>Eurypides,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Of an immortal God, again a Mortal made,</l>

               </p>
               <p>But ſo ſoon as he began to entertain a proſpect of Hope, of the change of his Fortune, he re-aſſumed the Regal Habit, and kept a little kind of Court at <hi>Thebes,</hi> though at the ſame time he reſtored their Democratick Government to that City.</p>
               <p>As for the treacherous <hi>Athenians,</hi> in this Misfortune, they again baſely deſerted him, and to do him the greater Diſgrace, they diſplaced <hi>Diphilus,</hi> who was that year the Prieſt of the <note place="margin">The Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> ond <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius.</hi>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:36410:61"/>
to the City: In this Diſtreſs they ſent out to him <hi>Craterus</hi> the Philoſopher, a Perſon of great Authority and Reputation, to mediate a Compoſure; who managed his Negotiation with ſo much dexterity, that, what with his humble Intreaties and Remonſtrances, and the ſolid Reaſons which he offered, <hi>Demetrius</hi> was perſuaded to raiſe the Siege; and ſhipping his Army which conſiſted of eleven thouſand Men, he reſolved upon an Expedition into <hi>Caria</hi> and <hi>Lydia,</hi> to take thoſe Provinces from <hi>Lyſimachus;</hi> arriving at <hi>Miletus,</hi> he was met there by <hi>Eurydice,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Philla,</hi> his deceaſed Lady, who brought along with her <hi>Ptolemaida,</hi> the Daughter whom ſhe had by King <hi>Ptolomy;</hi> which young Lady had before been affianced to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and with whom he now conſummated his Nuptials; but he was too intent upon his other Deſigns, to be diverted from them by his new Amour; and therefore he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently began the Campagne, and was ſo fortunate in the beginning, that many Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties revolted to him; and others, as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, the City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> he took by force, divers Troops of <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> alſo came over to him with a conſiderable Sum of Money. But his Fortune, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſtant, was now never laſting; for <hi>Agathocles,</hi> the Son of <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> with a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:36410:61"/>
powerful Army made head againſt him; which obliged him, with his Army to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert into <hi>Phrygia,</hi> with an intention to paſs into <hi>Armenia;</hi> for he had an imagination, that if he could perſuade the <hi>Medes</hi> or <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians</hi> to revolt, he ſhould thereby gain many convenient Sea-Ports, and Places of Retreat, to ſecure him againſt any ill Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident or Diſaſter that might befall him: <hi>Agathocles</hi> preſſed very hard upon him, and many Skirmiſhes and Conflicts paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Parties, wherein <hi>Demetrius</hi> had ſtill the Advantage: But <hi>Agathocles</hi> being much ſuperiour in number, ſtraightned him ſo much in his Forage, that his Souldiers were forced to conflict more with Famine, than with their Enemies, and ſhewed a great unwillingneſs to go into <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia;</hi> ſo that for freſh Quarters he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to paſs over the River <hi>Lycus,</hi> and in the paſſage, many of his Men, by the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidneſs of the Torrent, were carried down the Stream, and drowned: This Miſchance exaſperated the Souldiers to that degree, that one of them fixed this Paper upon the Door of his Pavillion, taken out of <hi>Oedipus,</hi> with a little variation of the Name.

And to add to his Misfortune, the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as is uſual, when Armies are driven to ſuch Neceſſities, as to ſubſiſt upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſom Diet, began to aſſail them as well as the Famine; ſo that he loſt eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of his Men, and with the reſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to <hi>Tarſus;</hi> and becauſe that City was under the Dominion of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> he ſtrictly prohibited his Souldiers the committing any manner of outrages or violence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling to create himſelf a new Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of <hi>Seleucus;</hi> but when he perceived it was impoſſible to keep the Souldiers in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they being reduced to extreme neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and <hi>Agathocles</hi> having block'd up all the Avenues of Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> to prevent their foraging in his Territories, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to write to <hi>Seleucus,</hi> to appeaſe him in this Matter: The Letter contained a long and tragical Relation of the miſerable ſtate to which he was reduced, and paſſionate Interceſſions for his commiſeration to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed King and Relation, who was fallen into ſuch a deplorable condition, as might extort Tenderneſs and Pity from his very Enemies.</p>
               <p>Theſe Letters did ſo mollifie the Heart of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> that he gave out poſitive Orders, to the Governours of thoſe Provinces, that they ſhould furniſh <hi>Demetrius</hi> with all Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations ſuitable to his Royal Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:36410:62"/>
and with ſufficient Proviſions for his Troops. But <hi>Patrocles,</hi> a Perſon of great Authority, and the Confident of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> perſuaded him, that this entertainment of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> eſpecially of his Souldiers, within his Dominions, was not at all agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſound Maxims of Policy; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, that of all the Kings of his time, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> was the moſt violent in his Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and addicted to bold and daring En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes; and that now being driven to Extremities by his adverſe Fortune, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which many times tempted Perſons of the greateſt Temper and Moderation, to the moſt deſperate Attempts, he could not with any Security to himſelf, afford him this Retreat or Entertainment: <hi>Seleucus</hi> animated with this Diſcourſe, advanced with a powerful Army towards <hi>Cilicia;</hi> and <hi>Demetrius,</hi> aſtoniſhed at this ſudden alteration, betook himſelf for ſafety to the Strengths and moſt inacceſſible places of Mount <hi>Taurus;</hi> from whence he ſent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys to <hi>Seleucus,</hi> to requeſt from him, that he would permit him the liberty with his Army to ſeek to repair his broken Fortunes among the barbarous Nations, and there to eſtabliſh a Kingdom, where he might paſs the remainder of his Life in quiet and repoſe; and not in that rigorous Seaſon of Winter, to expoſe him in this diſtreſſed,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:36410:63"/>
naked condition, to the fury of his impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Enemies; but to allow him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Time, and Maintenance for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his ſmall Army, till he might with convenience depart.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Seleucus,</hi> whoſe Jealouſie was now the governing Paſſion of his Soul, ſent him this peremptory Anſwer, That he would permit him to ſtay two Months and no longer in <hi>Cataonia,</hi> provided he preſently ſent him the principal of his Friends and Officers, as Hoſtages for his departure then; and in the mean time he ſhut up all the Paſſages into <hi>Syria:</hi> So that <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who ſaw himſelf thus encompaſſed as in a Toil, like an enraged Lion, flew upon the Prey, and fell to waſting the Territories of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and in many Encounters had the advantage of him; and particularly, when he was aſſailed by the Armed Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, he entirely defeated them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by opened his paſſage into <hi>Syria:</hi> And now finding his Souldiers animated by theſe Succeſſes, he was reſolved to puſh at all, and to have one deciding Blow for the Empire with <hi>Seleucus;</hi> but that crafty Prince having refuſed the aſſiſtance of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimachus,</hi> whom he both miſtruſted and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, made no great haſte to the Encounter, but choſe rather to weary <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and waſte his Power by Delays; for there was
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:36410:63"/>
nothing that he dreaded more than the perpetual viciſſitude of that Prince's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which he had ſo often known to have been raiſed from the moſt deplorate ſtate, to the greateſt exceſs of Glory.</p>
               <p>But now all things ſeemed to conſpire to the Ruine of this miſerable Prince; for he was ſeized with a violent Diſtemper, which did not only endanger his Life, but depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him of his Reaſon; ſo that his Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to moulder away inſenſibly; ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting, and others ſtealing away from the Service, which they concluded deſperate; after forty days he began to be ſo far reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, as to be able to rally his Forces, and marched as if he directly deſigned for <hi>Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia;</hi> but in the Night, in great ſilence he took a Counter-March, and paſſing the Mountain <hi>Amanus,</hi> he forraged all the Country as far as <hi>Cyrrheſtica.</hi> Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Seleucus</hi> advanced towards him, and encamping at no great diſtance, <hi>Demetrius</hi> took a reſolution to ſurprize him in his Camp; but the Deſign being by ſome Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives diſcovered to <hi>Seleucus,</hi> he had but juſt time in great conſternation to leap out of his Bed, and give the Alarm to his men; as he was putting on his Boots to mount to Horſe, <hi>Sirs,</hi> ſaid he to the Officers about him; <hi>Look well to your Charges; for we muſt now expect to combat with a furious,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:36410:64"/>
and enraged wild Beaſt.</hi> But <hi>Demetrius,</hi> by the Noiſe and Murmur he heard in the Camp, finding they had taken the Alarm, drew off his Troops, and began to retreat in the beſt order that he could; but the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning quickly appearing, <hi>Seleucus</hi> followed hard upon his Rear, and obliged him to a diſadvantageous Encounter. <hi>Demetrius,</hi> having drawn his Army into Order, and given the Command of one half of his Troops to one of his moſt expert Captains, with the other he in Perſon charged ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, that he forced his Enemies to give Ground: But <hi>Seleucus</hi> lighting from his Horſe, and covering his Arm with a Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, advanced to the foremoſt Ranks, and having put up the Vizor of his Helmet, that he might be known, he addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Souldiers of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to lay down their Arms, and not deſperately throw away their Lives; telling them withal, that it was for their ſakes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he had ſo long forborn coming to Extremities: And thereupon, without a Blow more, theſe perfidious Mercenaries ſubmitted, and ſaluted <hi>Seleucus</hi> as their King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who in the whole courſe of his Life, had been accuſtomed to ſtrange Turns, from thence drew a hope that he ſhould weather this Storm alſo; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:36410:64"/>
with the ſlender attendance of his Friends, he fled to the Mountain <hi>Amanus,</hi> where, in a thick and ſpacious Wood he ſecured himſelf, reſolving, under the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the Night, to make his Eſcape to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Caunus;</hi> where he hoped to find his Shipping ready to tranſport him: But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Enquiry, finding that they had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for more than one day, that Deſign was quaſh'd, and he began to think of ſome other Project, whilſt he was rowling over a thouſand irreſolute Thoughts, his Friend <hi>Soſigenes</hi> arrived, who had four hundred Pieces of Gold about him, and with this little Relief, he again re-aſſumed his firſt Reſolution and Hopes to recover the Coaſt; ſo ſoon as it began to be dark, he ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards the Mountains; but percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by their Fires, that the Enemies had poſſeſſed themſelves of all the Paſſages, and that it was impoſſible for him to paſs undiſcovered, he retreated to his old Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Wood, but not with all his Troop: for divers had deſerted him, and the little Remainder were extremely dejected and diſheartned, ſo that ſome of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to talk of rendring themſelves and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> to <hi>Seleucus,</hi> as the only Means left them for their Safety: Which <hi>Demetrius</hi> over-hearing, he drew out his Sword, and had infallibly paſſed it through his own
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:36410:65"/>
Heart, but that ſome of his Friends interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, prevented the fatal Attempt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to perſuade him, that it was much more manly to try the Generoſity of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus,</hi> and to reſerve his Life for a better Deſtiny, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uture Hopes: and with theſe Arguments, but principally by irreſiſtable neceſſity, he ſuffered himſelf to be overcome; and therefore diſpatched ſome of his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants to <hi>Seleucus,</hi> to let him know that he was willing to ſurrender himſelf and his Friends to his Generoſity and Mercy. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus</hi> tranſported at this News, cried out: <hi>It is not the good Fortune of</hi> Demetrius, <hi>which hath found out this Expedient for his Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but my own; which I eſteem the greateſt favour ſhe ever did me, ſince thereby ſhe hath given me opportunity to ſhew my Clemency and Generoſity.</hi> And inſtantly he gave Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his Domeſtick Officers to prepare a Royal Pavillion, and all things ſuitable, for the ſplendid Reception and Entertainment of <hi>Demetrius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was in the Court of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> one <hi>Apollonides,</hi> who formerly had been inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately known to <hi>Demetrius;</hi> he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the fitteſt Perſon, diſpatched from the King, to attend <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and to deſire him to diſſipate all manner of fear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, and to give him aſſurance that <hi>Seleucus</hi> was reſolved to treat him with all
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:36410:65"/>
the Honour due to a King, and the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Relation. No ſooner was this meſſage known, but all the principal Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers and Officers of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> thinking <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> would preſently become a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite with the King, made haſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate with <hi>Demetrius</hi> and kiſs his hand: but this ill tim'd application and over offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs, proved very miſchievous to that poor Prince; for it gave occaſion to his Enemies to inſinuate to <hi>Seleucus,</hi> that this Uſage of <hi>Demetrius</hi> was a moſt dangerous Civility, and that his preſence might have very fatal influences upon the Army, the Officers ſhewing more inclination to him already than was conſiſtent with their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or the ſafety of <hi>Seleucus;</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations made ſuch impreſſions upon the ſpirit of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> as produced diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſentiments and reſolutions from the former.</p>
               <p>For whileſt <hi>Apollonides,</hi> and after him many others were relating to <hi>Demetrius</hi> the kind expreſſions of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and the Orders he had given; and that poor Prince, who before thought this Rendition of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the greateſt misfortune of his Life, now began in his thoughts to applaud the Action, and to flatter himſelf with vain hopes, <hi>Pauſanias</hi> with a Guard of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe and Foot, amidſt all the Careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:36410:66"/>
of his Friends, came, and by order from the King ſeized him, and carried him, not as he hoped, as a Prince to the Preſence of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> but a Priſoner to the Caſtle of <hi>Cherſoneſus</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> where he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the ſafe Cuſtody of a ſtrong Guard. It is true he wanted nothing but Liberty, for by the command of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> he had a moſt liberal allowance for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and retinue; he had the liberty of a curious Garden and delightful Walks, and was for his Exerciſe permitted the Freedom of hunting in a large Park excellently ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Game of all ſorts, and had Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes likewiſe provided for his diverſion, and for his Chariots, and to make his life more eaſie, ſuch of his Servants as were willing to follow his Fortune, had the freedom of attending upon his Perſon; continual meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of kindneſs alſo, from time to time were brought him from <hi>Seleucus,</hi> requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to ſupport the preſent Reſtraint of his Liberty chearfully, aſſuring him, that ſo ſoon as <hi>Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Stratonice</hi> ſhould arrive at the Court, the Conditions and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of reſtoring him to his Liberty ſhould be perfected.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Demetrius</hi> had learnt to give little credit to theſe deluding pretences, and therefore ſo ſoon as he was fallen into the misfortune of this Captivity, he ſent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:36410:66"/>
command to his Son <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and to his Captains and Friends, at <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Corinth,</hi> that they ſhould give no manner of credit to any Letters written to them in his name, though they were ſealed with his own Signet, but, that looking upon him as if he were already dead, they ſhould reſerve what was left of his Empire for <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and eſteem him as their lawful King.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Antigonus,</hi> he received the ſad news of his Father's Captivity, with all the Teſtimonies of a moſt afflictive ſorrow; he put himſelf into deep mourning, and writ the moſt paſſionate and tender Letters to <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and the reſt of the Kings, that his grief could dictate; he offered not only whatever they had left in the World, but himſelf to be a Hoſtage for the Liberty of the King his Father. Several other Princes, and divers Cities alſo, became interceſſors for his freedom: only <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> by his Embaſſadors, baſely offered a large ſum of mony to <hi>Seleucus</hi> to take away his life; but by this barbarous propoſal, he rendred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf moſt deteſtable to <hi>Seleucus,</hi> to whom he was ſufficiently odious before; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs he ſtill protracted the time of his deliverance, reſolving, as he pretended, that he ſhould owe it to the Interceſſion of <hi>Antigonus</hi> and <hi>Stratonice.</hi>

                  <hi>Demetrius,</hi> to whom misfortunes had been cuſtomary, grew ſo familiar with this, that by long continuance, it became habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually eaſie: At firſt he accuſtomed himſelf to frequent exerciſes, Hunting, Horſe-races, and ſuch other divertiſements as were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him, but by degrees he came to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe them, and applied himſelf to Dice and Drinking, and to divert the importunity of his melancholy thoughts, with which he was haunted when ſober, he took the Remedy of Intemperance, a Cure worſe than the Diſeaſe; and whether this was the reaſon, or that this ſort of pleaſure was what he moſt naturally affected, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he had committed an error in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering himſelf to be diverted from it by his mad and vain Ambition, which had crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo much trouble to himſelf and others, he now ſpent the greateſt part of his time in this Way of conſuming both that and his health; and he, who had ſo reſtleſly toiled to find glory and happineſs, by Sea and Land, in mighty Fleets, and formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Armies, now thought he had found the only Way to tranquillity and repoſe, and he would often paſſionately ſay, <hi>What o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Period is there of all thoſe Wars, which miſerable Princes are wont to make, and what recompence can they hope for, to balance the pains they are at, and the dangers to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:36410:67"/>
which they are continually expoſed, beſides ſitting down quietly at laſt, and enjoying their pleaſures and delights?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demetrius</hi> having thus continued three years a Priſoner in <hi>Cherſoneſus,</hi> for want of exerciſe, and by indulging himſelf in Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, in the 54th. year of his Age fell ſick of a Diſtemper, which ended not but with his life: And <hi>Seleucus</hi> was extremely cenſured for making ſuch profeſſions of kindneſs, and reſtoring his Liberty to this Unfortunate Prince, but not performing them; and herein he did not imitate the bravery of <hi>Dromichetes</hi> of <hi>Thrace,</hi> who not only treated <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> when he was his Priſoner, nobly and like a King, but quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtored him to his former condition of Liberty.</p>
               <p>And now we muſt attend the Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Demetrius</hi> with our laſt ſervice to his Funerals, which ſuitable to his life, were very pompous and magnificent. For his Son <hi>Antigonus</hi> underſtanding that his aſhes were coming over from <hi>Syria,</hi> he went with a noble Fleet to the Iſles of the <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelagus</hi> to meet them, and cauſed them to be depoſited in an <hi>

He was not very rich, and withal diverted from the exerciſe of his good Nature by his Wife, a Friend of his that ſtood in need of money came to borrow of him; money he had none, and therefore commands his Servant to bring water in a ſilver Baſon with which he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd himſelf, as though he had deſign'd to ſhave, and ſending away the Servant upon another Errand, gave his Friend the Baſon, deſiring him to make what uſe he pleas'd on't, but this making a great ſtir among the Servants, and putting his Wife into very ill humour, to ſave her the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any further enquiry he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what he had done, and begg'd her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. His Wife was <hi>Julia</hi> of the Family of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> who for her diſcretion and fair behaviour was not inferiour to the moſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Ladies of that time. 'Twas under her that <hi>Antony</hi> received his Education, ſhe being after the death of his Father remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to <hi>Cornelius Lentulus,</hi> who was put to death by <hi>Cicero</hi> for having been of <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi>'s Conſpiracy: This probably was the firſt ground and occaſion of that mortal grudge that <hi>Antony</hi> bore <hi>Cicero,</hi> who alſo
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:36410:70"/>
did pretend that the body of <hi>Lentulus</hi> was denied Burial, till by great application made to <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Wife it was granted to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.</hi> But this ſeems to be a manifeſt Error, for none of thoſe that ſuffer'd in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulate of <hi>Cicero</hi> had the right of Burial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd them: As ſoon as <hi>Antony</hi> was grown <note place="margin">Is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucht by <hi>Curio.</hi>
                  </note> up, he prov'd a very beautiful youth, but by the worſt of misfortunes he fell into the acquaintance and made a ſtrict Friendſhip with <hi>Curio,</hi> a Man abandon'd to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; who, to make <hi>Antony</hi>'s dependance of greater neceſſity, plung'd him into all the inconveniencies of Whoring and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and made his Expences ſo Extravagant, that he contracted a debt that was very ſhameful in one of his age, even two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Talents. <hi>Curio</hi> was his Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which coming to the knowledge of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi>'s Father, he took an occaſion to diſmiſs <hi>Antony</hi> from his houſe. Soon after this he engaged himſelf with <hi>Clodius</hi> the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent and turbulent diſturber of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that that age had produced, but not being able long to endure his madneſs, and withal apprehenſive of the powerful Cabal againſt <hi>Clodius,</hi> he left <hi>Italy,</hi> and travell'd into <hi>Greece,</hi> where he ſpent his time in warlike Exerciſes, and in the Study of Eloquence; he affected much the Aſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick way of ſpeaking, which was moſt in
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:36410:71"/>
faſhion then, and had moſt reſemblance to his temper, which was very Rhodomantade and brave, very Ambitious, and unequal. After ſome ſtay in <hi>Greece,</hi> he was invited by <hi>Gabinius</hi> the Proconſul to make a Compagne in <hi>Syria,</hi> which at firſt he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, not being willing to ſerve in a private Character, but receiving a Commiſſion to Command the Horſe, he went along with him. His firſt ſervice was againſt <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus,</hi> who had prevail'd with the <hi>Jews</hi> to Rebel. He himſelf was the firſt that ſcal'd the Walls, and on the ſtrongeſt ſide of the Town, beat him from all his Forts, and in a pitcht Battel overcame him, though much inferior in number, put moſt of them to the Sword, and took <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> and his Son Priſoners. This War ended <hi>Gabinius</hi> was ſollicited by <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> to reſtore him to his Kingdom of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and a promiſe made of ten thouſand Talents reward, moſt of the Officers were againſt this enterprize, and <hi>Gabinius</hi> himſelf did not much approve it, though ſhrewdly tempted by the ten thouſand Talents, which had a powerful influence over him. But <hi>Antony</hi> deſirous of engaging in brave Actions, and willing to gratifie a Petitioning King, was reſolv'd to uſe all his Intereſt to bring about <hi>Gabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> to undertake this Expedition, all were of opinion that the March to <hi>Peleuſium</hi> was
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:36410:71"/>
of more dangerous conſequence than any thing elſe that could probably happen in the way; for they were to paſs over a deep Sand, where no freſh water was to be hop'd for, all along the Mariſhes of <hi>Serbonis,</hi> which the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> give out to be the hollow Canal through which <hi>Typhon</hi> takes his breath, and is in truth an Eruption cauſed by the over-flowing of the Red-Sea, which is ſeparate from the Mediterranean but by a ſmall Neck of Land. But <hi>Antony</hi> being Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd thither with a party of Horſe, did not only make himſelf Maſter of the paſſes, but won <hi>Peleuſium</hi> a ſtrong City, took in the Citadel, and by this means rendred the March ſecure to the Army, and the way to Victory not uneaſie to the General. The Enemy was ſenſible of <hi>Antony</hi>'s generous diſpoſition, for when <hi>Ptolomy</hi> had entred <hi>Peleuſium</hi> in great rage and malice, againſt the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> deſigning to put them every one to the Sword: <hi>Antony</hi> poſitively with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him, and hindred the Execution. In great and frequent skirmiſhes and battels many were the proofs he gave of his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Valor and Military Conduct, but never did it more plainly appear than in that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his, when wheeling about he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd the Rear of the Enemy, and gave opportunity to them that charg'd the Front to obtain an intire Victory, for which he
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:36410:72"/>
received both rewards and honors. Nor was his humanity leſs taken notice of towards the deceaſed <hi>Archelaus,</hi> he had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Gueſt and Acquaintance, as he was in duty bound he fought him bravely while alive, but finding his dead body, he buried him with all the Ornaments and Decency which were due to the quality of a King. Upon theſe and many other conſiderations, the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> ſpoke of him with infinite reſpect, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers lookt upon him as one of moſt worthy qualifications; to compleat all, he was a Man of Excellent Shape and Mein, his Beard was of a comely growth, his Fore-head large, his Noſe was of the <hi>Roman</hi> Shape, and ſomething he had in his Countenance of Greatneſs, that made him ſeem to reſemble the Statues and Medals we have of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and it was an ancient Tradition that the <hi>Antonies</hi> were deſcended of <hi>Hercules</hi> by a Son of his called <hi>Anteon,</hi> and this Opinion he endeavored to confirm by affecting the likeneſs of him both in his Mein and Dreſs, for whenſoever he appear'd in publick he wore his Veſt girt low about the hips, a broad Sword on his ſide, and over all a large courſe Plad, or Mantle. What might ſeem to ſome very inſupportable, as vain glory, raillery, drinking in publick, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting the Common Soldiers Tables and eating places, made him the delight and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:36410:72"/>
pleaſure of the whole Army. He was very agreeable in his Loves, and gain'd many Friends by the aſſiſtance he gave them in theirs, being very pleaſant in his Raillery upon his own intrigues. The generous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which he was of, in diſpoſing of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuities with an open and liberal hand to the Soldiers, and his Friends, gave him a fair opportunity of making his fortune, and was very advantageous to him in eſtabliſhing him in his new honours and employments, from which it is improbable he ever could have fallen, but by a thouſand follies which he was Maſter of. One inſtance of his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality I muſt relate, he had order'd to one of his Friends twenty five thouſand Crowns, and his Steward wondring at the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of the ſum, laid all the Silver in a heap as he ſhould paſs by. <hi>Antony</hi> ſeeing the heap ask'd what it meant? His Steward reply'd, the mony you have order'd to be diſpos'd of to your Friend, well perceiving the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the Action, ſays he, I thought I had order'd much more, 'tis too little, pray let the ſum be doubled; but enough of this. The Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> were divided into two parties, they that ſeemed to favor the Senate follow'd <hi>Pompey,</hi> who was then preſent, the others that conſider'd the intereſt of the People ſheltred themſelves under the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who was then making War
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:36410:73"/>
in <hi>Gaul. Curio</hi> the Friend of <hi>Antony</hi> having changed his party, had devoted himſelf to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and brought over <hi>Antony</hi> to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, the Authority which he had gain'd by his Eloquence and great expences which were conſtantly ſupply'd by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> gave him opportunity of making his Friend <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> firſt Tribune of the People and then Augur, whoſe coming into the heat of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs made him capable of rendring no ſmall ſervices to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> In the firſt place he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the Conſul <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who had deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome old Legions for <hi>Pompey</hi> with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to raiſe new ones, making an order that they ſhould be ſent into <hi>Syria</hi> to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force <hi>Bibulus</hi> his Army, who was then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king War with the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and that no one, as they ſhould anſwer it at their peril, ſhould give in their Names to ſerve under <hi>Pompey.</hi> Next finding that <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Faction would not ſuffer <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Letters to be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or read in the Senate, by vertue of his Office he read them publickly, and ſucceeded ſo well, that many were brought to change their mind, and to declare that <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands were but juſt and reaſonable; at length two queſtions being ſtarted, the one whether <hi>Pompey</hi> ſhould diſmiſs his Army, the other if <hi>Caeſar</hi> his: ſome were for the former, for the latter all, except ſome few; when <hi>Antony</hi> ſtood up and put the queſtion,

if it would be agreeable to them that both <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould diſmiſs their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which propoſal was approv'd of with great acclamations, and <hi>Antony</hi> deſir'd, after much honor receiv'd, to put it to the Vote, but this was oppos'd by the Conſuls, and <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Friends making ſome new propoſals, which did not carry the leaſt appearance of unreaſonableneſs were brow beaten by <hi>Cato,</hi> and <hi>Antony</hi> himſelf commanded to leave the Senate by Conſul <hi>Lentulus.</hi> He gave them many a bitter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:36410:75"/>
to him; but this Danger he eſcaped, by reaſon that the South-Wind was ſo high that the Enemies Fleet was not able to live in ſo rough a Water; but. withal he had like to have fallen upon a Ridge of Rocks, where the Sea wrought ſo high, that there was no hope of eſcaping Ship-wrack, when all on a ſudden the Wind turn'd about to South-weſt, and blew from land to the main Sea, where <hi>Antony</hi> ſailing in ſecurity, ſaw the Coaſt all covered with the Wreck of the Enemies Fleet; for the Gallies of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> had been miſerably toſs'd up and down, and many of them ſunk; he took many Priſoners, and much Booty; he took alſo the Town of <hi>Lyſſus,</hi> and by the ſeaſonable arrival of ſo great Recruit, gave heart to the Affairs of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> There was no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement in which he did not ſignalize himſelf; twice he ſtopt the Army in its flight, led them back to a Charge, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Victory, that not without reaſon, his Reputation, next to <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the Army; and what opinion <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf had of him, did well appear, when <hi>Pharſalia</hi> was to determine who ſhould be Emperour of the World; he himſelf choſe to lead the right Wing, committing the charge of the left to <hi>Antony,</hi> as to the moſt experienc'd Officer of all that ſerv'd under him.

this action he did incurr the diſpleaſure of the common People, and, by reaſon of his Courſe of Life, was not only not agreeable, but (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays) had in deteſtation by the better ſort of People, abominating his Midnight-Revelling, his wild Expences, and his rowling from one little Whore to another, his Naps in the Day, and his Walks to digeſt his Debauches, and then at Night again his Entertainments and Balls, for the ſolemnizing the Nuptials of ſome Comoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian or Buffoon.

And it ſeemed very unreaſonable that <hi>Caeſar</hi> out of <hi>Italy</hi> ſhould fare hard, and with great fatigue and danger purſue the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a dangerous War, whilſt others, in pretending his Authority, left no inſolence unpractis'd upon their Fellow-Citizens, and this undoubtedly was occaſion of great Trouble in <hi>Rome,</hi> and gave the Souldier encouragement to injure and plunder the People; upon this, it is probable that <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> at his return, acquitted <hi>Dolabella,</hi> and being created the third time Conſul, took not <hi>Antony,</hi> but <hi>Lepidus</hi> for Colleague. <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Houſe being to be ſold, <hi>Antony</hi> would buy it, but was much troubled at the paying for it. This, and that he thought his former Services had not been recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced as they deſerved, made him not follow <hi>Caeſar</hi> with his Army into <hi>Libya;</hi> and it is apparent, that <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing his Follies, was a great Means of his amendment; being weary therefore of this Courſe of Life, he marries <hi>Fulvia</hi> the Widow of <hi>Clodius,</hi> the great Ring-leader of the People, a Woman not born for Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or Houſwifry, nor one that could be

content with the power of ruling a private Husband, but a Lady capable of adviſing a Magiſtrate, and of ruling the General of an Army, ſo that <hi>Cleopatra</hi> had great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to her for having taught <hi>Antony</hi> to be ſo good a Servant, he coming into her hands tame and broken in all obedience to the Commands of a Miſtreſs. <hi>Antony</hi> had many Devices by which he uſed to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and divert her from her more ſerious way of Carriage. As when <hi>Caeſar</hi> after his Victory in <hi>Spain,</hi> was on his return, <hi>Antony,</hi> among the reſt, went out to meet him, and a Rumour being ſpread that <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> was kill'd, and the Enemy marching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy,</hi> he return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> and diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf, came to her by night, as a Servant that brought Letters from <hi>Antony;</hi> but ſhe, with great impatience, before ſhe receiv'd the Letter, asks if <hi>Antony</hi> were well? inſtead of an Anſwer, he gives her the Letter, and as ſhe was opening it, took her about the Neck and kiſs'd her. This little Story, of many of the ſame nature, we thought fit to give you, by which you might gueſs of his humour. There was no body of Quality in <hi>Rome,</hi> that did not go ſome days journey to meet <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Spain;</hi> but <hi>Antony</hi> was the beſt received of any, admitted to ride the whole Journey with him in his Coach; behind

came <hi>Brutus, Albinus,</hi> and <hi>Octavian,</hi> his Siſter's Son, well known afterward by the name of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar.

Theſe Paſſages gave great encouragement to <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> who in making choice of truſty Friends for ſuch an Enterprize, were thinking to engage <hi>Antony;</hi> every one approved the Man, but <hi>Trebonius,</hi> who did inform them that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> and he had been very intimate in the late Journey they took to meet <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and that he had let fall ſeveral Words concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Matter now in hand, on purpoſe to ſound him; that <hi>Antony</hi> very well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood him, but did not at all approve of the Diſcourſe; howſoever the Matter was never reveal'd to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but ſtill kept as a great Secret. The Conſpirators then propoſed that <hi>Antony</hi> ſhould die with him, which <hi>Brutus</hi> would in no wiſe conſent to, not thinking fit that an Action under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in defence of Juſtice and the Laws, ſhould be liable to ſo foul an Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Antony</hi> therefore, who was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a Man of Bodily Strength, and one that bore great Office in the State, was at <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Entry to the Senate, to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:36410:79"/>
be amuſed without, in a Diſcouſe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Buſineſs. Juſt as it was ordered, <hi>Caeſar</hi> was ſlain, and <hi>Antony</hi> ſurpriz'd at the Action, took the Diſguiſe of a Servant's Habit, and retir'd; but underſtanding that the Conſpirators had aſſembled in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol, and had no further Deſign upon any one, he gave them his Honour they might come down in ſafety, and ſent his Son for an Hoſtage. That night <hi>Caſſius</hi> ſupp'd at <hi>Antony</hi>'s Houſe, and <hi>Brutus</hi> with <hi>Lepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> where they reſolved the Senate ſhould be call'd; and having paſs'd an Act of Oblivion for the ſettlement of Affairs, Governments were aſſign'd to <hi>Caſſius</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> and whatſoever Acts had paſſed during the Reign of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> were ratified with the conſent of the whole Senate. Thus <hi>Antony</hi> went out of the Senate with that Reputation and Eſteem that never Man had gain'd before him; for it was apparent to the World that he had taken away all the Grounds of a Civil War, and had ſhewn himſelf an able Miniſter of State, that knew how to unravel and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Matters of ſo great Danger and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty.

               <p>While Matters went thus in <hi>Rome,</hi> the young <hi>Caeſar, Julius Caeſar</hi>'s Siſter's Son, and by Teſtament left his Heir, arrived at <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Apollonia,</hi> where he was when his Uncle was kill'd. The firſt thing he did was to viſit <hi>Anthony,</hi> as one his Uncle had greateſt Obligation to; he ſpoke to him concerning the Money that was in his hands, and reminded him of the Legacy <hi>Caeſar</hi> had made of ſeventy five <hi>Drachms</hi> to every <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen: <hi>Antony</hi> at firſt laughing at ſuch Diſcourſe from ſo young a man, told him, he wiſh'd he were in his Health, and that he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good Counſel, and good Friends; to tell him the Burden of being Executor to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> would ſit very uneaſie upon his young Shoulders. This was no Anſwer to him, but ſtill he inſiſts to have the Money and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:36410:80"/>
other goods which were his Inheritance, inſomuch that <hi>Antony</hi> us'd him injuriouſly, thwarted his Intereſt upon all Occaſions, oppos'd him in his Election of Tribune, and when he urged the dedication of his Father's Golden Chair (as had been Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted) he threatned to ſend him to Priſon if he deſiſted not from ſoliciting the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This made the young <hi>Caeſar</hi> apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>Cicero,</hi> and all thoſe that hated <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,</hi> by them he was recommended to the Senate, while he himſelf courted the People, and from their reſpective quarters took the old Soldiers, and form'd them into a Body: this made <hi>Antony</hi> ſo apprehenſive, that he gave him a meeting in the Capitol, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome words they came to an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
               <p>That night <hi>Antony</hi> had a very unlucky Dream, fancying that his right hand was Thunder ſtruck, and ſome few days after he was inform'd that <hi>Caeſar</hi> deſign'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his life. <hi>Caeſar</hi> would have juſtify'd himſelf, but was not believ'd, ſo that the breach was now made as wide as ever, each of them poſted day and night all about <hi>Italy</hi> to engage the old Troops that lay ſcatter'd in their Quarters, and great were the promiſes that were made to the Legions that were yet ſtanding. <hi>Cicero</hi> was of great reputation in <hi>Rome</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:36410:81"/>
and made uſe of all his Art to exaſperate the People againſt <hi>Antony,</hi> and at length perſwaded the Senate to declare him a publick Enemy, and to ſend to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Rods and Axes, and all other Marks of Honour, that are uſually given to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and withal an Order was given to <hi>Hirtius</hi> and <hi>Panſa,</hi> who were their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls to drive <hi>Antony</hi> out of <hi>Italy.</hi> The Armies engag'd nigh to <hi>Modena,</hi> and <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> himſelf was preſent. <hi>Antony</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, though both the Conſuls were ſlain. <hi>Antony</hi> in his Flight was purſued by all the misfortune imaginable, and the worſt ſhape it appear'd in was famine, but it was in theſe extremities that he natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fell into a behaviour, that made him appear a Man much above himſelf; and <hi>Antony</hi> in misfortune was not eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd from a vertuous Man. It is no extraordinary matter for Men that fall into great difficulties, to reaſon right, and underſtand what by their duty and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour they are bound to do and ſuffer: Yet there are but a very few, who in great extremities have courage enough to truſt to their own Judgment, either to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate what they admire, or avoid what they Condemn, but abandon themſelves to their beloved Eaſe, and for very want of induſtry become irreſolute. <hi>Antony</hi> was
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:36410:81"/>
a moſt illuſtrious Example of patience to the Army, who accuſtomed to ſo much Luxury and delicacy, could be contented to drink ſtinking water, and feed upon wild Fruits, and Roots, nay 'tis reported they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the very Barks of Trees, and in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing over the <hi>Alpes</hi> they lived upon the Fleſh of Beaſts, that man had never before taſted of, his deſign was to joyn <hi>Lepidus,</hi> who commanded the Army on t'other ſide the <hi>Alpes,</hi> who he imagined would ſtand his ſure Friend, he having done him many kind Offices to <hi>Julius Caeſar;</hi> he encamped near <hi>Lepidus</hi> his Army, but receiving from him no ſort of encouragement, was reſolv'd to puſh his Fortune and venture all. His hair was very long and diſorder'd, nor had he ſhaved his beard ſince his laſt defeat, in this guiſe, and a mourning Mantle flung over, he came into the Trenches of <hi>Lepidus,</hi> and began to Harangue the Army, ſome were moved at his habit, others at his words, that <hi>Lepidus</hi> liking it not, ordered the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets to ſound, that he might be heard no longer. This rais'd in the Soldiers a greater ſenſe of pity, ſo that they reſolv'd to ſend and conferr with him, and dreſt <hi>Laelius</hi> and <hi>Clodius</hi> in Womens Cloaths, and ſent them to <hi>Antony,</hi> they advis'd him preſently to attack <hi>Lepidus</hi> his Trenches, aſſuring him that a ſtrong party ſhould receive him, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:36410:82"/>
if ſo he thought fit kill <hi>Lepidus.</hi> But <hi>Antony</hi> would not ſuffer that any injury ſhould be done him, and next morning he marched his Army to paſs over the little River that parted the two Camps, he was the firſt that gain'd the other ſide of the River, where he eſpy'd <hi>Lepidus</hi> his Soldiers in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers reaching out their hands to help him; and beating down the works to make him way: Being entred the Camp, and finding himſelf abſolute Maſter, he treated <hi>Lepidus</hi> with great civility, and gave him the title of Father, when he ſpoke to him, and though he had every thing at his own Command, he left him the honour of being called the General. This fair uſage brought over to him <hi>Munatius Plancus,</hi> who was not far off with a conſiderable Force. Thus being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong he repaſs'd the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and led with him into <hi>Italy,</hi> ſeventeen Legions, and ten thouſand Horſe, beſides ſix Legions he left in Garriſon under the Command of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> one of his familiar Friends, that uſed to debauch with him, and was therefore ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Cotylon</hi> (which ſignifies a bottle,) <hi>Caeſar</hi> perceiving that <hi>Cicero</hi>'s intention was to re-eſtabliſh the State in its former liberty, did ſoon quit that party, and by the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Friends came once more to a good underſtanding with <hi>Antony.</hi> They both met together with <hi>Lepidus</hi> in a ſmall Iſland,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:36410:82"/>
where the Conference laſted three days. The Empire of the World was ſoon deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd of, it being divided amongſt them, as if it had been their paternal Inheritance: That which gave them all the trouble was to agree who ſhould be put to death, every one intending to deſtroy his Enemies and to ſave his Friends. The thirſt of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of their Enemies did in the end take off all manner of deſire to preſerve their Friends, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſacrific'd <hi>Cicero</hi> to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, Antony</hi> his Uncle <hi>Lucius</hi> to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and both of them did eaſily grant to <hi>Lepidus</hi> the Liberty to murther his own Brother <hi>Paulus,</hi> though there are thoſe that ſay it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him. I do not believe any thing was ever heard of ſo barbarous as this Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for in this exchange of blood for blood, they did not only murder thoſe that were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd up unto their Fury, but them alſo that they abandon'd to the range of others. This Agreement being made the Army deſir'd it might be confirm'd by ſome Alliance of Marriage, ſo that <hi>Caeſar</hi> married <hi>Claudia</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Fulvia</hi> Wife to <hi>Antony.</hi> This affair being diſpatch'd, three hundred more were adjudg'd to dye (by proſcription) <hi>Antony</hi> had given order to thoſe that were to kill <hi>Cicero,</hi> to cut off his head and right hand with which he had writ his invectives againſt him, when they were brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:36410:83"/>
him, he beheld them with an inward ſatisfaction, not being able to contain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from often ſmiling at ſo horrid a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, when he had ſatiated himſelf with the ſight of them, he ordered them to be hung up in the Court where the uſual pleadings were, not conſidering that the affront he deſign'd to the memory of the dead redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his own diſgrace, who by this barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Action rendred himſelf unworthy of that power he exercis'd. His Uncle <hi>Lucius</hi> being cloſely purſued had taken refuge in his Siſters Chamber, who when the murderers had broke into her houſe, and were preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing into her Chamber, ſhe met them at the door, and holding them by the hands cry'd out ſeveral times, Ye ſhall never kill <hi>Lucius, Caeſar,</hi> till you firſt diſpatch me, me that gave your General his life and being; and ſhe order'd the matter ſo well that ſhe ſav'd her Brother.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Triumvirate</hi> was very hateful to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Antony</hi> was moſt of all to blame, for he was Elder than <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and had greater Authority than <hi>Lepidus,</hi> and withal was no ſooner ſettled in his affairs, but he return'd to his debauch and diſſolute way of living: Beſide the ill reputation he had gained by his intemperance, it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſadvantageous to him his living in the houſe of <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, a Man as much
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:36410:83"/>
celebrated for his temperance and honeſty, as ever he was admir'd for having Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed three times. They could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regret ſee the doors of that houſe ſhut againſt the Magiſtrates and Foreign Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who were ſhamefully refus'd admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, while it was open to Players, Juglers, and devouring Flatterers, upon whom he ſpent the greateſt part of his ill acquired Riches, for they did not only take the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of the Eſtates of ſuch as were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, defrauding the poor Widows and Orphans, and lay impoſitions upon all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Goods, but hearing that ſeveral ſumms of money were, by as well Strangers as Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> depoſited in the hands of the Veſtal <hi>Virgins,</hi> they went and took the money away by force. <hi>Caeſar</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how extravagant <hi>Antony</hi> was in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, demanded a diviſion to be made of the Revenues: The Army was alſo divided upon their march into <hi>Macedonia</hi> to make War with <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> they leaving the Command of the City to <hi>Lepidus,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving paſs'd the Sea they encamped nigh the Enemy; <hi>Antony</hi> nigh <hi>Caſſius,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> nigh <hi>Brutus: Caeſar</hi> did nothing worth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, but ſucceſs and Victory did ſtill wait on <hi>Antony.</hi> In the firſt Battel <hi>Caeſar</hi> was routed by <hi>Brutus,</hi> all his Baggage taken, and he himſelf very narrowly eſcaping by
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:36410:84"/>
Flight, but as he himſelf writes in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs, he retir'd before the Charge by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a dream of one of his Friends. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> overcame <hi>Caſſius,</hi> but as ſome write he himſelf was not preſent at the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that he joyn'd them afterwards in the purſuit. <hi>Caſſius</hi> with earneſt entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had perſwaded his faithful Friend <hi>Pinda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> not knowing any thing of <hi>Brutus</hi> his good Fortune, to kill him. Shortly after they fought another Battel, in which <hi>Brutus</hi> loſt the day and ſlew himſelf. <hi>Caeſar</hi> being ſick, <hi>Antony</hi> had the honour of the Action, who finding <hi>Brutus</hi> his Body among the ſlain, he gently reproach'd him with the death of his Brother <hi>Caius,</hi> who was put to death by <hi>Brutus</hi> his order in <hi>Macedonia</hi> in revenge of <hi>Cicero,</hi> but he ſaid <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was moſt to blame, who was therefore order'd to be ſlain upon his Brother's Tomb. He caſt his rich purple Mantle upon the dead Body of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and gave in charge to one of his Servants to take care of his Funeral, who not burning the Mantle with the Corps, as <hi>Antony</hi> came to underſtand, and detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the money which was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in the Funeral, was order'd to be ſlain. <hi>Caeſar</hi> was carryed to <hi>Rome,</hi> no one expecting that he ſhould recover from his ſickneſs.

he entred <hi>Greece</hi> at the head of a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Army. And the Impoſitions of neceſſity were to be very great ſince they had enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that every common Soldier ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive for his pay five hundred Crowns.</p>

                  <hi>Antony</hi>'s behavior towards the <hi>Grecians</hi> was very obliging, he was pleas'd to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf in hearing the learned men diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, in ſeeing their ſports, frequenting their Religious Ceremonies, and ſhew'd a great deal of equity in deciding of Controverſies: He was fond of being ſtil'd the Lover of <hi>Greece,</hi> but above all in being call'd the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Athens,</hi> to which City he had made very conſiderable preſents.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Megareans</hi> in imitation of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> muſt needs invite <hi>Antony</hi> to come and ſee their Senate Houſe, which whilſt he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd, they ask'd him how he lik'd it? he told them 'twas very narrow and ruinous, he cauſed an exact ſurvey to be made of the Temple of <hi>Apollo Pythius</hi> as if he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to repair it, and indeed he had enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf to the Senate ſo to do, but paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing into <hi>Aſia,</hi> he forgot all theſe glorious Projects, and leaving <hi>Lucius Cenſorinus</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> his whole application was to inrich himſelf with the Spoils of <hi>Aſia.</hi> There Kings every morning waited his Leaſure at his Chamber door, and Queens were rival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling one another, who ſhould make him the

Thus whilſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in War, and ſtrugling with Seditions in <hi>Rome, Antony</hi> at his Eaſe, fell naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>his old courſe of life: The <hi>Anaxenores</hi> a ſet of Harpers, the <hi>Xuthi,</hi> a company of Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers upon the Flute, and <hi>Metrodorus</hi> a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Maſter, with ſome other bands of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Muſick, did ſo much ſurpaſs his <hi>Italian</hi> Maſters, that they had got great credit at Court: Nothing ran in the uſual Channels, all buſineſs paſſing through their hands, ſo that all <hi>Aſia</hi> was like the City that <hi>Sophocles</hi> ſpeaks of, Where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>When he made his Entry into <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the Women met him in the ſame habit they ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize the Feaſts of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> the Men and Boys were dreſt like Satyrs and Faunes, and quite throughout the Town nothing was to be ſeen but ſpears wreath'd about with Ivy, Harps, Flutes and Hautbois, they ſaluted <hi>Antony</hi> in their Songs by the Name of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> the gracious and the gentle, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he was to ſome, but for the moſt part he was barbarous and inhuman, for he would deprive perſons of worth and quality of their Fortunes to gratifie Villains and Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:36410:85"/>
who would ſometimes beg the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of Men yet living, pretending they were dead, and obtaining a Grant, take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion: He gave his Cook the Houſe of a <hi>Magnetian</hi> Citizen for dreſſing his Supper well. But when he burthened <hi>Aſia</hi> with doubling the Impoſts, <hi>Hybreas</hi> the Agent for thoſe Cities made his remonſtrance in very pleaſant language, and not ungrateful to <hi>Antony,</hi> ſhewing him that ſince he thought fit to double their Taxes he would take ſome care that they might have their Summer and Autumn doubled too, that they might be in a condition to ſatisfie his demands: Then he added with ſome ſharpneſs and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance; In <hi>Aſia</hi> has been raiſed for your ſervice two hundred thouſand Talents, which if you have not received, take an account of them that Levy'd it, but if it be receiv'd and yet you are in want, we are for ever ruin'd. Theſe laſt words did touch <hi>Antony</hi> to the quick, who, very ignorant of many things that were done in his name, not that in his nature he was eaſily to be impos'd upon, but by reaſon he had too great confidence in the integrity of thoſe he employ'd. He was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally very ſincere, but ſomewhat ſlow of apprehenſion, but ſo ſoon as he was made ſenſible of his faults, he was much troubled, and very ready to ask pardon of them he had offended, he was very prodigal in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:36410:86"/>
and very ſevere in his puniſhments, but his Generoſity was much more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant than his Severity; his Raillery was very ſharp, but the edge of it was taken off, and rendred inoffenſive by his ſuffering any thing of Repartee; for he was as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be handſomely rallyed, as he was pleas'd to rally others; this freedom had its inconvenience, for he imagined that thoſe Friends, who uſed ſo much freedom in their mirth, would never flatter or deceive him in any buſineſs of conſequence, not perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that theſe ſubtil Paraſites dreſt their ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome flattery with a little pointed ſauce to make it go down the better, which muſt have given him a ſurfeit had it not been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed, and great uſe was made of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in buſineſs of importance, for upon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining any difficulty they order'd their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair ſo that they might ſeem not to yield to him out of complaiſance, but that he had a reach much Superior to their capacity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antony</hi> being of this diſpoſition, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <note place="margin">He falls in Love with <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
                  </note> miſchief that could befal him was the Love of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> which awaken'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd many a hidden dormant Vice, and if there were any ſpark of Virtue yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it ſtifled it intirely. And thus it was his Love began; making preparation for the <hi>Parthian</hi> War, he ſent to Command her to make her perſonal appearance in <hi>Cilicia</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:36410:86"/>
to anſwer an accuſation that ſhe had given great aſſiſtance in the late Wars to <hi>Caſſius. Delleus</hi> who was ſent on this Meſſage had no ſooner ſeen her admirable beauty, and with what a quickneſs and grace ſhe receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, but he began to conſider how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it was that ſo beautiful a Creature ſhould receive any ill treatment at the hands of <hi>Antony,</hi> and therefore he behaved himſelf with all reſpect to her, courted her with all humility to paſs into <hi>Cilicia</hi> in ſplendid Equipage, and intreated her not to be apprehenſive of <hi>Antony,</hi> a brave and courteous Soldier. She had great Faith in the words of <hi>Dellius,</hi> but more in her own Beauty, which having formerly recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her to <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> and the young <hi>Pompey,</hi> ſhe did not doubt but it might prove ſucceſsful with <hi>Antony:</hi> Their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance was with her when a <hi>Girl,</hi> young and ignorant in the Arts of Love, but ſhe was now to meet <hi>Antony</hi> in the flower of her age with all the Charms of Beauty, and all the artifice of riper years: ſhe makes great preparation for her Journey, of Money, Gifts and other Ornaments of great value, which ſo wealthy a Kingdom did eaſily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, but in her own irreſiſtible Charms lay her great aſſurance: many were the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhe received from <hi>Antony</hi> to haſten her coming, but ſhe did not ſeem to make any
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:36410:87"/>
great account of his Orders. At length ſhe embarks upon a ſmall Galley in the River <hi>Cydnus;</hi> the head of the Barge did ſhine with inlaid Gold, the Sails were of Purple Silk, the Oars of Silver, which beat time to the Flutes and Hautbois; ſhe herſelf lay all along under a Canopy of Cloth of Gold curiouſly embroider'd, dreſt as <hi>Venus</hi> is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily repreſented, and beautiful young Boys like <hi>Cupids</hi> ſtood on each ſide to fan her, her Maids were dreſt like Sea Nymphs and Graces, ſome ſteering the Rudder, ſome working at the Ropes; the perfumes diffus'd themſelves from the Veſſel to the Shore, which was all cover'd with multitudes meeting and following the Galley, all the People running out of the City to ſee this ſtrange ſight, left <hi>Antony</hi> alone upon the Tribunal, and a rumor was ſpread abroad that <hi>Venus</hi> was come to Feaſt with <hi>Bacchus</hi> for the common good of <hi>Aſia:</hi> Aſſoon as ſhe was arriv'd <hi>Antony</hi> ſent to invite her to Supper, but ſhe thought it more decent that <hi>Antony</hi> ſhould come to her, who to ſhew his civility to a Stranger made no difficulty to wait on her; he found the preparations very magnificent, but nothing was ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable as the great number of Lights, for on a ſudden there was let down altogether ſo great a number of branches with Lights in them ſo ingeniouſly diſpoſed, ſome in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:36410:87"/>
ſquares, and ſome in circles, that Fame can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak of a greater piece of curioſity. The next day <hi>Antony</hi> invited her to Supper, and was very deſirous to out-do her as well in Magnificence as contrivance, but he came ſhort of both, and was ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of it that he began to deſpiſe and laugh at his own way of ſervice. She per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that <hi>Antony</hi>'s raillery was very groſs, and ſavour'd more of the Soldier than the Courtier, ſhe gave herſelf the liberty to uſe him in the ſame manner without any ſort of reſerve. <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was not, as is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, of ſo ſurprizing a Beauty, that no one could be compared with her, or that no one could behold her without aſtoniſhment, but her Converſation had thoſe Charms that were not to be reſiſted, and that natural grace and ſweetneſs which appear'd in every thing ſhe ſaid or did, ſtung her beholders to the Soul. Her tongue was hung ſo harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly, that no Inſtrument was capable of more variety of ſounds. She ſpoke moſt Languages, there were but few of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Nations that ſhe anſwer'd by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, to moſt of them ſhe gave Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience herſelf, as to the <hi>Aethiopians, Troglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites, Hebrews, Arabians, Syrians, Medes, Parthians,</hi> and many others, which is the more admirable in conſideration that the moſt of the Kings her Predeceſſors could

ſcarce attain to the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> tongue, and that ſeveral of them had quite forgot the <hi>Macedonian,</hi> which was their original Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antony</hi> was ſo ſtrangely taken with this Woman, that notwithſtanding <hi>Fulvia</hi> his Wife maintain'd his quarrels in <hi>Rome</hi> againſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> with great difficulty, and that the <hi>Parthian</hi> Troops commanded by <hi>Labienus</hi> (that King having made him General) were aſſembled in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> and ready to enter <hi>Syria,</hi> could yet ſuffer himſelf to be carried away by her into <hi>Alexandria,</hi> there to lead an eaſie Childiſh life in diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements too youthful for his age, ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring away as <hi>Antipho</hi> calls it his moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and not to be retrieved time. They gave their way of living a particular name, calling it, the inimitable life. They treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one another by turns, and their Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were without reaſon or meaſure. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I have heard my Grandfather <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prias</hi> relate that <hi>Philotas</hi> a Phyſician of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſſa,</hi> who was at that time a Student in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> had told him, that he having an acquaintance with one of <hi>Antony</hi>'s Cooks was invited by him to ſee what ſumptuous preparations they were making for Supper, coming into the Kitchin, he admir'd the prodigious variety of all things, but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſeeing eight wild Boars roaſted

whole, ſays he, ſurely you have a great number of Gueſts; the Cook laugh'd at his ſimplicity, and told him there was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twelve to ſup, but that every Diſh was to be ſerved up juſt roaſted to a turn, and if any thing was but one minute ill timed 'twas ſpoil'd, for, ſaid he, may be <hi>Antony</hi> will ſup juſt now, may be not this hour, may be not theſe two hours, for that he has a mind to ſpend ſome time in drinking or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing, ſo that it is not one but many ſuppers muſt be had in readineſs, for it was not eaſie to gueſs at his hour. This was <hi>Philotas</hi> his Story, who related beſides how coming afterwards into the ſervice of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi>'s eldeſt Son by <hi>Fulvia,</hi> and being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with others of the better rank of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to ſit at Table with him, when he did not eat with his Father, it happen'd that another Phyſician, full of argument and noiſe had given great diſturbance to the Company, whoſe mouth <hi>Philotas</hi> ſtopt with this Sophiſtical Syllogiſm: It is proper to give cold water to one that has a Fever in ſome degree; every one that has a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath it in ſome degree; it is good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to give cold water in a Fever. The Man was quite ſtruck dumb, and <hi>Antony</hi>'s Son very much pleas'd, ſaid, <hi>Philotas</hi> all that is yours, pointing to a ſide-board co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with rich plate. <hi>Philotas</hi> thank'd

him for his good will, but could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the young Man had power to diſpoſe of things of that value, but ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Plate was all brought to him, and he deſired to ſet his mark upon it, who fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to accept the preſent, what ails the Man (ſaid he that brought it) do you know that he that gives you this is <hi>Antony</hi>'s Son, who could very well ſpare it if it were all gold, but if you will be advis'd by me, I would counſel you to accept of the value in money, for there may be amongſt the reſt ſome piece of antiquity, or the Work of ſome famous Maſter that <hi>Antony</hi> may have a particular eſteem for.

The <hi>Parthians</hi> ſtanding ſtill while the <hi>Romans</hi> march'd by them, were in great admiration of their man-like Behaviour, and exact Diſcipline, nothing could be more juſt than the diſtance which was kept between the Ranks, and the ſhaking their Pikes as they paſs'd by, in a profound ſilence, was very graceful; but when the Signal was given, the Horſe turn'd ſhort upon the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and with loud Cries charg'd them home; they were bravely receiv'd at firſt; but the Legions coming up with loud ſhouts and ratling of their Arms, did ſo frighten the Horſes, and ſoon the <hi>Parthians</hi> themſelves, that they could keep their ground no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. <hi>Antony</hi> preſs'd them hard, in great hopes that this Victory ſhould give an end to the War; the Foot had them in purſuit three Leagues, and the Horſe nine, and the Advantage ſumm'd up, they had but thirty Priſoners, and there was but fourſcore ſlain: This was a great diſcouragement to them,

to conſider, that when they were victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, their Advantage was ſo ſmall, and that when they were beaten, they loſt ſo great a number of Men; as it happened when the Carriages were taken.</p>
               <p>The next day, having put the Baggage in order, they marched back to the Camp before <hi>Phraata:</hi> in the way, meeting with ſome ſcattering Troops of the Enemy, and as they marched further, with greater Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, at length with the Body of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Army, freſh and in good order, who charg'd them, and broke their Ranks, that it was not without great difficulty that they reach'd the Camp.

Some few days therefore being ſpent in ordering the Baggage, he reſolv'd upon his March; and here it was that <hi>Antony,</hi> the man in the world the fitteſt to harangue the Army, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf oppreſs'd with ſhame and grief, could not find in his heart to ſpeak him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but employed <hi>Domitius Aenobarbus;</hi> many of the Souldiers reſented it, as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing of them; but the better ſort ſaw the true cauſe, and thought this rather an argument, why they on their ſide ſhould treat their General with more reſpect than ordinary. <hi>Antony</hi> having reſolved to return by the ſame way he came, which was thro' a plain flat Country, a certain <hi>Mardian</hi> came to him (one that was very converſant with the Manners of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and whoſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to the <hi>Romans,</hi> had been tried at the

diſpoſing of the Slingers in the Front, to make the on-ſet; but the <hi>Parthians</hi> came pouring upon them, thinking to encompaſs the Army; they were receiv'd by the light Horſe, which were ſore gall'd by their Jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins, but they themſelves being warmly entertain'd, and many wounded, made their retreat, but ſoon after rallying up afreſh, they were beat back by a Battalion of <hi>Gallick</hi> Horſe, and appear'd no more that day. By their manner of Attack, <hi>Antony</hi> being inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted what to do, did not only place the ſlings and javelins in the Front, but lin'd both the wings with the ſame, and ſo march'd in a ſquare Battel, giving order to the Horſe to charge and beat off the Enemy, but not to follow them too far as they retir'd. So that the <hi>Parthians</hi> not doing much more Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief for the four enſuing days than they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, began to abate in their heat, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining that the Winter-Seaſon was much advanc'd, preſs'd for returning home.</p>
               <p>On the fifth Day <hi>Flavius Gallus,</hi> a brave Officer, who had a conſiderable Command in the Army, came to <hi>Antony,</hi> deſiring of him ſome Troops of light Horſe out of the Rear, and ſome other Horſe out of the front, with the which he would undertake to do ſome conſiderable ſervice. Which when he had obtain'd, he beat the Enemy back, not retiring, as was uſual, to the Groſs of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:36410:101"/>
the Army, but making his ground good, and preſſing on with great obſtinacy, the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers who commanded in the Rear of this Detachment, perceiving how far he had got from the Body of the Army, ſent to warn him back, but he took no notice of them. 'Tis ſaid, that <hi>Titius</hi> the Queſtor ſnatch'd the Colours, and retreated, telling <hi>Gallus</hi> that he did very ill to lead ſo many brave men on to certain deſtruction, he on the other ſide, reviling him again, and commanding the men that were about him to ſtand firm, <hi>Titius</hi> made his retreat, but <hi>Gallus</hi> charging the enemies in the Front, was encompaſs'd by a Party that fell upon his Rear; which at length perceiving, he ſent a Meſſenger to demand ſuccour; but they that commanded the Legions, among which was <hi>Canidius,</hi> a particular Favourite of <hi>Antony</hi>'s, ſeem'd to have committed a great overſight; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of marching up with the whole Army, they ſent ſmall Parties, and when they were defeated, they ſtill ſent out ſmall Parties; ſo that by their ill management, the whole Army was in danger of being routed, which had certainly happen'd if <hi>Antony</hi> himſelf had not march'd from the front of the main Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel at the head of the third Legion; which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through them that fled, fac'd the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, &amp; hindred them from any farther pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. In this Engagement, were killed three
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:36410:101"/>
thouſand, five thouſand were carried back to the Camp, the wounded, amongſt the reſt, <hi>Gallus</hi> ſhot through the Body with four Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, of which wounds he died. <hi>Antony</hi> went from Tent to Tent, to viſit and comfort the wounded, and was not able to ſee his men without weeping, but they would take him by the hand chearfully, and intreat him to go and get his own Wounds dreſs'd, and not concern himſelf for them; calling him their Emperour and their General, and that if he did well, they were ſafe. For in ſhort, never ſince that time can Fame make mention of a General at the Head of ſo gallant a Body of Men; whether you conſider Strength and Youth, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Sufferance in all Labours and Fatigues; but as for the exact Obedience, and particular Reſpect they bore their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that good will and perfect Friendſhip, that was ſo univerſal in the Army amongſt Small and Great, Nobles and Peaſants, Officers and common Souldiers, ſo affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate, and ſo devoted to him, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr his good Opinion of them to their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Lives and Being; that in this part of Military Diſcipline I may boldly ſay they equall'd the Glory and Reputation of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Rome.</hi> Of which Love, as I have ſaid before, many were the Reaſons, as the Nobility and Antiquity of his Family, his
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:36410:102"/>
Eloquence, his Behaviour, his Liberality, and Magnificence, his Familiarity in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining every Body, and particularly, his Kindneſs in aſſiſting, viſiting and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing the ſick, furniſhing them with all things neceſſary, that the poor Wretches that were ſick and wounded, were as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily diſpoſed to ſerve, as thoſe that enjoy'd their Health and Vigour. But this laſt Victory had ſo encouraged the Enemy, that they began to deſpiſe the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſtaying all night on horſeback, nigh the Camp, in expectation of Plundering their Tents and Baggage, which they concluded they muſt deſert, as a great impediment in their flight; and in the morning new Forces arrived, that their number was grown to be at leaſt 40000 Horſe. The King having ſent Guards that attended upon his own Perſon, as to a ſure and unqueſtion'd Victory; for he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was never preſent in fight. <hi>Antony</hi> deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to harangue the Souldiers, call'd for his mourning-habit, that he might move them the more; but he was perſuaded by his Friends to put on the habit of General. In his Speech he gave great commendations to them that had gain'd the victory; as for thoſe that fled, he blam'd them much; the former gave him great Encouragement in their brave Promiſes; and the latter excuſing themſelves as well as they could, told
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:36410:102"/>
him they were ready to undergo decima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or if there were any other puniſhment he would pleaſe to inflict upon them they did ſubmit chearfully, only intreating that he would forget and not diſcompoſe himſelf with their faults, at which he lifted up his hands to Heaven, and prayed the Gods, that if to balance the great favours he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of them, any judgment lay in ſtore, that they would pour it upon his head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and grant that Army victory. The next day they took better order for their march, and the <hi>Parthians,</hi> who thought they were marching rather to plunder than to fight were ſurpriz'd to find the enemy not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartened, but freſh and reſolute, ſo that they themſelves began to loſe courage; but for all this, at the deſcent of a little Hill, where the <hi>Romans</hi> were oblig'd to paſs, the <hi>Parthians</hi> got together, and let fly their arrows in great ſhowers upon them, and by reaſon of the difficulty of the way, their march was very ſlow. Here the Legions that were arm'd at all points were order'd to defend on each ſide the light arm'd, by kneeling down on their knees, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d holding their ſhields ſtooping over them, the next rank holding theirs over the firſt, and ſo on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that the army in this figure did much reſemble the order that is obſervable in the tiling of a Houſe, or the degrees in a Theatre,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:36410:103"/>
and is a ſure defence againſt Arrows, which glance upon them without doing any harm. The <hi>Parthians</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Romans</hi> down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their knees could not imagine but that it muſt proceed from wearineſs; ſo that they laid down their Bows, and taking their Spears made a fierce onſet: when the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> with a great cry leaped upon their Legs, and with their Lances ſlew the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt and put the reſt to flight. After this rate it was every day, and the trouble they gave <hi>Antony</hi> was ſo vexatious that his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were ſhort, by reaſon of which the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine was very great in the Camp, for they could get but little Corn, and that which they got they were forc'd to fight for, and beſides this they were in great want of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to grind their Corn, and make their Bread, they had left them behind, the baggage horſes being dead, or otherwiſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in carrying the ſick and wounded: Proviſion was ſo ſcarce in the Army, that half a Peck of Wheat was ſold for five Crowns, and Oats for the weight in Silver; they were brought to feed upon Herbs and Roots, ſuch as are commonly eaten were very ſcarce, ſo that they were conſtrain'd to venture upon any they found, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers they happen'd upon an Herb that was mortal, which did firſt take away all ſenſe and underſtanding. He that had eaten of it
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:36410:103"/>
remembred nothing in the World; and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed himſelf wholly in removing of ſtones from one place to another, which he did with as much earneſtneſs and induſtry, as if it had been a buſineſs of the greateſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and required diſpatch; through all the Camp there was nothing to be ſeen but Men grubling upon the ground for ſtones, which they carried from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but in the end after having vomited much Choler they fell down dead, and chiefly this when their Wine began to fail, which was a ſovereign remedy againſt this diſtemper. When <hi>Antony</hi> ſaw them die ſo faſt, and the <hi>Parthian</hi> ſtill in purſuit, he was heard to cry out, <hi>O the ten Thouſand, the ten Thouſand!</hi> In remembrance of the famous retreat of <hi>Xenophon,</hi> who when he had a longer journey to make from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and a more powerful enemy to deal with, brought his Men home ſafe. The <hi>Parthians</hi> finding that they could not defeat the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, nor in no wiſe break the order of their Battel, and that withal they had been ſo often worſted, began to treat the forra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with a great deal of humanity; they came up to them in all appearance of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with their Bows unbended telling them that they were going home to their houſes, that they had quite given o'er the purſuit, and that only ſome <hi>Median</hi> troops would
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:36410:104"/>
follow them for two or three days, not with any deſign to annoy them, but only for the defence of ſome ſcattering Villages, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, they ſaluted them and embraced them with a great ſhew of friendſhip. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,</hi> who had all along a great deſire to march through the flat Country, hearing theſe diſcourſes was almoſt reſolv'd to march the open way, and ſo much the more in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that no water was to be hoped for in thoſe Mountains. But while he was delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, <hi>Mithridates</hi> arriv'd in the Camp, he was firſt couſin to <hi>Moneſes,</hi> of whom we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated that he came for refuge into the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, and receiv'd in gift from <hi>Antony</hi> three <hi>Cities.</hi> Upon his arrival he deſired ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy might be brought to him that could ſpeak <hi>Syriack</hi> or the <hi>Parthian</hi> Tongue. One <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> a friend of <hi>Antony</hi>'s was brought to him, to whom the ſtranger declar'd, that he was ſent to <hi>Antony</hi> from <hi>Moneſes</hi> in acknowledgment of the favours and honours he had received from him, and to make him a return if it were poſſible; he asked <hi>Alexander</hi> if he ſaw thoſe high Hills, pointing at ſome diſtance: He told him yes. 'Tis there ſaid he the whole <hi>Parthian</hi> Army attend your paſſage, the great Plains behind thoſe Hills will be very advantageous to you in your march, and therefore there they do expect you in ambuſh, being perſwaded you
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:36410:104"/>
will confide in their promiſes, and leave the way of the Mountains; 'tis true that in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing o'er the Mountains you will ſuffer the uſual inconveniences for want of water, and the fatigue will be ſomewhat the greater; but if you paſs through the plains, <hi>Antony</hi> muſt in all appearance run the fortune of <hi>Craſſus.</hi> This ſaid, he departed. <hi>Antony</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his friends in Council, ſent for the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> guide, who was of the ſame opinion. He told them that the way through the plain was a great way about, and very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to find, that the other indeed was rough, but then it was but for a day. Changing therefore his mind, he march'd away that night, and commanded that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one ſhould carry water ſufficient for his own uſe, but moſt of them being unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of veſſels; they made ſhift with their helmets, thoſe that had bottles fill'd them for their own uſe. The <hi>Parthians</hi> were no ſooner acquainted that the <hi>Romans</hi> were on their march, but they followed them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their cuſtom, the ſame night, and by break of day they fell in with the rear, which was quite tired with marching, and want of ſleep, that they were not in condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of making any conſiderable defence, for they had march'd fifteen leagues that night, and at the end of their journey found the enemy at their heels, which put them out
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:36410:105"/>
of all patience; beſides being to fight for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſtep of the way they made in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat their thirſt was increaſed beyond all ſufferance. Thoſe that were in the front of the Army were come up to a River, the water of which was extremely cool and clear, but brackiſh and medicinal, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drank cauſed an unquenchionable thirſt, and acute pains in the Bowels; of this the <hi>Mardian</hi> had forewarn'd them, but their thirſt was ſo great, that beating back them that oppos'd them, they drank largely of it. <hi>Antony</hi> ran from one place to another, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging they would have a little patience, that not far off there was a River of wholeſom water, and that the reſt of the way was ſo difficult for the Horſe that the Enemy could purſue them no further; and ſaying this, he order'd to ſound a retreat to call them back that were engaged, and commanded the Tents ſhould be ſet up, that the Soldiers might refreſh themſelves in the ſhade; but the Tents were ſcarce well put up, and the <hi>Parthians</hi> retired according to their cuſtom, when <hi>Mithridates</hi> came again to them, and inform'd the Interpreter, with whom he had before ſpoken, that he ſhould do well to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe <hi>Antony</hi> to ſtay where he was no longer than needs he muſt, that after having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh'd his Troops, he would endeavour with all diligence to gain the next River, that
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:36410:105"/>
the <hi>Parthians</hi> would purſue them no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but ſo far they were reſolv'd to follow them. <hi>Alexander</hi> who was the Interpreter made his report to <hi>Antony,</hi> who order'd a good quantity of Gold Plate to be preſented to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who taking as much as he could well hide under his Gown went his way. Upon this advice <hi>Antony</hi> decamp'd while it was yet day, and the whole Army march'd without receiving any moleſtation from the <hi>Parthians;</hi> but they themſelves were the cauſe that that night was the moſt terrible of any they had yet paſt; for ſome of the Army had robb'd and kill'd ſuch as they ſuſpected to have any Money, ranſack'd the Baggage and ſeiz'd on the Money which was to pay the Army, in the end they laid hands on <hi>Antony</hi>'s own equipage, broke all his inlaid Tables, and Cups of precious Stones, dividing the fragments amongſt them. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> hearing ſo great a confuſion could not imagine any thing leſs than that the Enemy, falling upon his Troops, had utterly routed them, upon which he ſent for one of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>ards called <hi>Rhamnus,</hi> to whom he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given his liberty, and made him ſwear, that whenſoever he ſhould give him orders, he ſhould run his Sword through his body, and cut off his head, that he might not fall alive into the hands of the <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> nor dead be known to be their General.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:36410:106"/>
While he was in this conſternation and all his friends about him in tears, the <hi>Mardian</hi> came into the Tent and gave them all new Life, he did convince them, that by the coolneſs of the Air, and the freſh gales that blew ſo temperately, the River which he ſpoke of could not be far off, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the difficulties of their retreat, and the danger of the Enemies purſuit, were now at an end, the which he was the more aſſured of, becauſe they had marched a great while and the night almoſt ſpent; he was inform'd at the ſame time that the great confuſion, which was in the Camp, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the avarice of ſome few Soldiers that were pillaging one another. In order to compoſe this unruly tumult, he made a halt, and commanded the Signal to be given for incamping, the day began to break before the tumult was well appeas'd, and the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> bore hard upon the Rear with their Arrows; the light arm'd Troops were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to make head againſt them, and being ſeconded by the Legions, who covered one another with their Shields; they bravely receiv'd the onſet of the Enemy, who did not think convenient to advance any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Army marching very leiſurely, they at laſt came in ſight of the River, where <hi>Antony</hi> upon the Banks drew up the Horſe in a poſture to receive and oppoſe
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:36410:106"/>
the Enemy, and to favour the paſſage of his Army o'er the River, he firſt paſt over the ſick and wounded, and then all the reſt; thoſe that were left drawn up on th' other ſide had leiſure to drink at their eaſe, for the <hi>Parthians,</hi> being now come to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which was to be the bounds of their purſuit, unbent their bows, and told the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> they might paſs over freely, and made them great complements in praiſe of their valour and conduct. At length the Horſe paſs over too, without being in the leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted by the enemy, and when they were on the other ſide the river, they drank their fill, as the others had done before, and joyn'd the reſt of the Army, not giving any credit to the fair words of their deceitful enemies. It was ſix days after the laſt skirmiſh that they arrived at the River <hi>Araxes,</hi> which divides <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> and ſeemed, both by its deepneſs and the violence of the current, to be very dangerous in paſſing, and a report had crept in amongſt them, that the Enemy was in ambuſh ready to ſet upon them as ſoon as they ſhould be amus'd in their paſſage. But when they were got over on the other ſide, and found themſelves in <hi>Armenia,</hi> juſt as if they were come into harbour after a tempeſt, they worſhip'd the Land, and ſhedding tears for joy, every one embraced his friend; but taking their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:36410:107"/>
through a Land that abounded in all ſorts of plenty, and having ſuffer'd great want, they eat with that exceſs of every thing they met, that they fell into Dropſies, and Dyſenteries. Here <hi>Antony</hi> making a review of his Army, found that he had loſt twenty thouſand Foot, and four thouſand Horſe, of which the better half periſhed, not by the Enemy but by Diſeaſes; their march was of twenty ſeven days from <hi>Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ata,</hi> in which the <hi>Parthians</hi> were worſted in eighteen Battels, by which it is manifeſt that <hi>Artuaſdes</hi> was the cauſe why <hi>Antony</hi> could not bring this War to a happy end, for had the ſixteen thouſand <hi>Median</hi> Horſe, skilful in the Diſcipline of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and accuſtomed to their manner of fight, been preſent, the <hi>Romans</hi> having put them once to flight, and the purſuit left to the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> it is impoſſible they could have rallied after their defeat, and appear again as they did in a poſture to receive the Enemy; for which reaſon the whole Army was very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt with <hi>Antony</hi> to march into <hi>Armenia,</hi> but he taking advice of his neceſſities, did not upbraid him with his diſſertion, nor in the leaſt abate of the uſual civility, with which he was wont to treat him; for he found the Army wearied out, and in want of all manner of neceſſaries, but upon another occaſion coming into <hi>Armenia</hi> with invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:36410:107"/>
and fair promiſes, he prevail'd with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaſdes</hi> to meet him, where he ſeized him, bound him and carried him to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> there to be led in triumph; by which he very much offended the <hi>Romans,</hi> in that he carried into <hi>Egypt</hi> the triumphal Ornaments due unto his Country, only to ingratiate himſelf with <hi>Cleopatra:</hi> But theſe matters happen'd afterwards. For the preſent mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his Army in great haſte in the depth of Winter through continual ſtorms of Snow, he loſt eight thouſand of his Men, and came very ill accompany'd to a place called <hi>Leucocome,</hi> ſituated betwixt <hi>Sydon</hi> and <hi>Beryte</hi> nigh the Sea ſide, where he ſate down in expectation of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and being impatient of the delay ſhe made, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelf of ſhort'ning the time in drink and debauchery, and not being able to endure the tediouſneſs of a Meal, he would ſtart from Table and run to ſee if ſhe were coming, and this laſted till ſhe came into Port. She brought with her Cloaths and Money for the Soldiers. Some ſay that <hi>Antony</hi> having received the Cloaths of her, diſtributed his own Money in her name.</p>
               <p>About this time a difference happen'd 'twixt the King of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Phraortes</hi> King of <hi>Parthia</hi> about diviſion of the booty that was taken from the <hi>Romans,</hi> which cauſed great apprehenſion in the <hi>Median</hi> leaſt he
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:36410:108"/>
ſhould loſe his Kingdom, he ſent therefore Ambaſſadors to <hi>Antony</hi> with offers of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into a confederat War againſt <hi>Phraortes,</hi> which gave <hi>Antony</hi> great hopes of obtaining his deſire, ſeeing that by this means he ſhould have ſuch horſe as was neceſſary to reduce the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and upon this conſideration he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into <hi>Armenia,</hi> and joyning the King of <hi>Media</hi> nigh <hi>Araxes</hi> they began the War.</p>

                  <hi>Octavia</hi> having a deſire to ſee <hi>Antony</hi> ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily obtained leave of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> not ſo much to gratifie her humour, as to find a good pretence to begin the War upon her ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: She no ſooner arrived at <hi>Athens,</hi> but in Letters from <hi>Antony</hi> ſhe underſtood his new expedition, and his will that ſhe ſhould attend him there, though ſhe were much diſpleas'd, not being ignorant of the ground of this uſage, yet ſhe writ to him to know to what place he would be pleas'd ſhe ſhould ſend the things ſhe had brought with her for his uſe, for ſhe brought cloaths for his Soldiers, many horſes, money and preſents for his Friends and Officers, and two thouſand choſen Soldiers well arm'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit the <hi>Praetorian Cohorts.</hi> This Meſſage brought <hi>Niger</hi> from <hi>Octavia</hi> to <hi>Antony;</hi> in the relation ſpeaking much of her praiſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting much upon her merit. <hi>Cleopatra</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inform'd that <hi>Octavia</hi> was coming, and fearing leaſt that her eaſineſs of behaviour

and obſervance of <hi>Antony</hi>'s humour joyn'd with her diſcretion, and powerful alliance, ſhould render her charms irreſiſtible, ſhe betook her ſelf to die for love of <hi>Antony,</hi> bringing her body down with a ſlender opening Diet; when he entred the room ſhe fix'd her eyes upon him in a rapture, and when he took his leave, ſhe never fail'd to ſwound; when ſhe deſign'd to cry, ſhe would turn about and wipe her eyes as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling to let him know the greatneſs of her concern, all this was acting while he prepar'd for <hi>Media,</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that were to help forward the deſign, upbraided <hi>Antony</hi> with his inſenſibility, who could baſely ſee a Lady periſh, whoſe ſoul depended upon him, and him alone; they added, that it was true <hi>Octavia</hi> was his Wife, and did enjoy that honourable Title, becauſe it was found convenient for the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of her Brother that it ſhould be ſo, but <hi>Cleopatra</hi> the ſoveraign Queen of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, muſt be contented with the name of his Miſtreſs, nor did ſhe ſhun or deſpiſe the character, whilſt ſhe might ſee him, whilſt ſhe might live with him and enjoy him, if ſhe were bereav'd of this, ſhe would not ſurvive the loſs. <hi>Antony</hi> was ſo well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that <hi>Cleopatra</hi> muſt die if he forſook her, that he put off all thoughts of the War, and return'd to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> deferring his

                  <hi>Median</hi> expedition till next Summer, though he were inform'd of great ſeditions among the <hi>Parthians.</hi> Some while after he went into that Country, and made an alliance with the King of <hi>Media</hi> by Marriage of a Son of his by <hi>Cleopatra</hi> to the King's Daughter, who was yet very young; and ſo return'd with his thoughts taken up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Civil War. When <hi>Octavia</hi> return'd from <hi>Athens, Caeſar</hi> who thought ſhe had been treated very injuriouſly, commanded her unto his own houſe, but ſhe refuſed to leave the houſe of her Husband, and intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, that unleſs he had other motives to make War with <hi>Antony,</hi> that he would deſiſt, thinking it very ſcandalous to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of the two greateſt Commanders in the World, that they had involved the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> People in a Civil War, the one to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie his Miſtreſs, the other the reſentment of his Siſter's uſage. Her behaviour did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm her words to be her reſolution, for ſhe retired to his houſe and took that worthy care, not only of his Children by her, but of thoſe by <hi>Fulvia</hi> alſo, as if he had been preſent. She received very kindly all the friends of <hi>Antony</hi> that had any pretenſion to preferment; or came to <hi>Rome</hi> upon any buſineſs, and was ready to prefer their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> but this honourable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment of hers was injurious to the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:36410:109"/>
of <hi>Antony,</hi> who could be capable of treating ill, a Woman of that merit; nor was the dividend he made unto his Sons at <hi>Alexandria</hi> look'd upon but as inſolent, and derogating from the honour of the <hi>Romans;</hi> for aſſembling the People in the publick place, and cauſing two Golden Thrones to be placed in a State of Silver, the one for him, and another for <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and at their feet lower Seats for his Children, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed <hi>Cleopatra</hi> Queen of <hi>Aegypt; Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus, Africa</hi> and <hi>Caeloſyria,</hi> and with her to be joyn'd <hi>Caeſario</hi> the ſuppoſed Son of <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Dictator, who left <hi>Cleopatra</hi> with Child; as for his Sons by him and <hi>Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> they were to be treated in the ſtile of King of Kings: To <hi>Alexander</hi> he gave <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia</hi> and <hi>Media</hi> with <hi>Parthia,</hi> ſo ſoon as it ſhould be overcome, to <hi>Ptolomy, Phaeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, Syria, Cilicia. Alexander</hi> was brought out before the People in the <hi>Median</hi> habit, in a Gown and narrow Hat, and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> in Slippers and a Mantle, with a Cap done about with the Diadem; for this was the habit of the ſucceſſors of <hi>Alexander;</hi> this the <hi>Median</hi> and <hi>Armenian</hi> dreſs: and as ſoon as they had ſaluted their parents, the one was received by a Guard of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> the other by one of <hi>Armenians. Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi> was then, as at other times, when ſhe appear'd in publick, dreſt in the habit of the

Goddeſs <hi>Iſis,</hi> and did give audience unto the People under the name of the new <hi>Iſis. Caeſar</hi> relating theſe things in the Senate, and often accuſing him to the People, had created in them an ill will towards him: Nor was <hi>Antony</hi> backward in his part to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate. The principal of his Articles were theſe; Firſt, that he had not made any diviſion with him of <hi>Sicily,</hi> which was lately taken from <hi>Pompey.</hi> Secondly, that he had not made reſtitution of the Ships he had lent him. Thirdly, that the power of <hi>Lepidus,</hi> his Collegue being abrogated he had retained his Army, his Governments, and the Revenues to him appropriated: And Laſtly, that he had parcell'd out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all <hi>Italy</hi> amongſt his own Soldiers, and deviſed nothing to his. <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s anſwer was as follows: <q>That ſince <hi>Lepidus</hi> was not fit to Rule he had diſmiſt him, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that what he had got in War he would divide with <hi>Antony,</hi> ſo ſoon as he would give him his ſhare of <hi>Armenia:</hi> That his Soldiers had not their ſhare in <hi>Italy,</hi> becauſe they were in poſſeſſion of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Parthia,</hi> which having fought bravely under their Emperour they had joyned to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</q> 
                  <hi>Antony</hi> was in <hi>Armenia</hi> when this news came to him, he preſently therefore ſent <hi>Canidius,</hi> with ſixteen Legions towards the Sea, but
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:36410:110"/>
he in the company of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> went for <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where the Rendezvous of the Fleet was order'd, which conſiſted, reckoning in the tenders, of eight hundred Veſſels, of which <hi>Cleopatra</hi> furniſh'd two hundred, and * twenty thouſand Talents, with Proviſion <note place="margin">Nigh one million of our Mony.</note> for the whole Army during the War. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> was adviſed by <hi>Domitius</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to ſend <hi>Cleopatra</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> there to expect the event of the War; but ſhe dreading a Peace might be contriv'd by the mediation of <hi>Octavia,</hi> had prevail'd with <hi>Canidius</hi> by a conſiderable ſumm of Money to plead her Cauſe with <hi>Antony,</hi> and to let him know that it was not juſt, that one that bore ſo great a part in the charge of the Wars, ſhould be robb'd of her ſhare of Glory in the carrying it on; nor wou'd it be politick to diſoblige the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who were ſo conſiderable a part of his Naval Forces: Nor did he ſee how ſhe was inferior to any of his Companions in Prudence, conſidering how well ſhe had govern'd a great Kingdom by her ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and by the conſtant management of affairs, had arrived to a great Capacity. Theſe arguments gain'd upon his Spirit, for it was deſtin'd by Fate, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould have all: So that joyning their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they made Sail for <hi>Samos,</hi> where they made very good Chear; for as it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:36410:111"/>
that all Kings, Princes, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, all Common-wealths, and Cities within the Circuit and Dependances of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> the <hi>Maeotide</hi> Lake, <hi>Armenia,</hi> and <hi>Illyria,</hi> do bring, or cauſe to be brought all Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Munition neceſſary for War; ſo was it alſo proclaim'd, that all ſuch as made any profeſſion of divertiſement, ſhould make their appearance at <hi>Samos;</hi> ſo that (while the whole World was in Tears and Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) this Iſland alone for ſome days was fill'd with all ſorts of Harmony, and the Theatre crowded with Dancers and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medians, each City ſent Oxen for Sacrifice, and the Kings that accompanied <hi>Antony,</hi> were in a perpetual diſpute, who ſhould make the moſt magnificent Feaſts, and the greateſt Preſents; every particular man aſtoniſh'd at what he ſaw, ſaying, What will they do to be glad enough when they have got the Victory, ſince they are at ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Merriment at the opening of the War? This over, he gave <hi>Priene</hi> to his Players for a Habitation, and ſet Sail for <hi>Athens;</hi> where a-freſh, Sports and Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres were his Joy. <hi>Cleopatra</hi> being jealous of the Honour <hi>Octavia</hi> had receiv'd at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> (for <hi>Octavia</hi> was much beloved by the <hi>Athenians)</hi> ſhe inſinuated her ſelf into the favour of the People with all the Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities imaginable: The <hi>Athenians,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:36410:111"/>
having decreed her Publick Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, deputed ſeveral of the Citizens to wait upon her at her Houſe; amongſt the which, <hi>Antony</hi> was one, as being free of the City; and he it was that made the Speech: He ſent order to <hi>Rome</hi> to have <hi>Octavia</hi> removed out of his Houſe, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by all <hi>Antony</hi>'s Children, except the Eldeſt by <hi>Fulvia,</hi> who was then with his Father; weeping and grieving that ſhe muſt be look'd upon as one of the Cauſes of the Civil War, ſhe was pitied by the <hi>Romans,</hi> but more was <hi>Antony</hi> pitied by them that had ſeen <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who was not preferable to <hi>Octavia,</hi> neither for Youth nor Beauty. <hi>Caeſar</hi> having an account what great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations <hi>Antony</hi> had made, was afraid leſt the War ſhould be begun that Summer; for he wanted many Neceſſaries, and the People grudged very much to pay the Subſidies, for they that were obliged to pay the Fourth of what their yearly Revenue was; and the <hi>Libertines,</hi> who paid an Eighth, did do it with ſuch reluctancy, that great Troubles had like to have enſued throughout all <hi>Italy;</hi> and this is looked upon as one of the greateſt of <hi>Antony</hi>'s O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſights, that he did not then preſs the War; for he gave <hi>Caeſar</hi> leiſure to provide himſelf, and ſatisfie the People; for while that Money is ſqueezing out of the People,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:36410:112"/>
they are very mutinous, but when they have parted with it, they are well enough ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to be quiet. <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Plancus,</hi> Men of Conſular Dignity, and Friends to <hi>Antony,</hi> having been ill us'd by <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> whom they oppoſed in her Deſign of being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the War; came over to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and being acquainted with the Contents of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi>'s Teſtament, did inform him, it was depoſited in the hands of the Veſtal-Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, who did deny to deliver it up, but ſent him word, if he pleaſed, he might come and ſeize it himſelf; which he did; and reading it over to himſelf, he noted thoſe Places that were moſt for his purpoſe, and having ſummoned the Senate, did read them publickly: Many were ſcandalized at the Proceeding, thinking it very hard that they ſhould think of puniſhing a man for what was not to be, till after his Death. He did more urgently preſs what <hi>Antony</hi> had left in his Will concerning his Burial; for he had order'd, that though he died in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> his Body ſhould be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly carried through the Market-Place, and ſent to <hi>Cleopatra</hi> at <hi>Alexandria.

He anſwered, that his Buſineſs might very

well deſerve a ſerious Conference; but one thing he had to deliver, which might be ſpoke either full or faſting; which was, that Matters would bear much a better Face, if <hi>Cleopatra</hi> would return into <hi>Egypt: Antony</hi> being very angry, <hi>Gleopatra</hi> told him, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,</hi> you have done very well to tell us this important Secret without a Rack: <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi> took an occaſion to make his eſcape, and got to <hi>Rome:</hi> Many more of <hi>Antony</hi>'s Friends were driven from him, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent uſage they could not bear from <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi>'s Flatterers; amongſt the which were <hi>Marcus, Syllanus,</hi> and <hi>Dellius</hi> the Hiſtorian.

Theſe Prodigies were ſaid to forebode the War. <hi>Piſaurum,</hi> where <hi>Antony</hi> had ſettled a Colony near the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, was ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in an Earthquake; a Marble Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Antony,</hi> that was at <hi>Alba,</hi> did ſweat for many days together; and though it were often wip'd, it continued to ſweat: When he himſelf was in the City of <hi>Patras</hi> the Temple of <hi>Hercules</hi> was burnt by light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: At <hi>Athens Bacchus</hi> was by a great Wind blown out of the Battel of the Giants and the Gods, and laid flat upon the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre; for <hi>Antony</hi> did derive himſelf from <hi>Hercules</hi> as we ſaid before: And in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Bacchus</hi> in his way of living, was called young <hi>Bacchus;</hi> the ſame Whirlwind at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> did bring down from amongſt many others, the great Statues of <hi>Eumenes</hi> and <hi>Attalus,</hi> which were called the <hi>Antonine</hi> Statues.

how things ſtood, chang'd his opinion, and now was of adviſe that <hi>Cleopatra</hi> ſhould be ſent back, and that retiring into <hi>Thracia</hi> or <hi>Macedonia,</hi> the quarrel might be decided in a Land fight, and that <hi>Ditomes</hi> the King of the <hi>Getes</hi> was in a readineſs to attend him with a great Army, and that it was not in the leaſt any diſparagement to him to quit the Sea to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who in the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Wars had gain'd ſo great experience in Sea affairs, but that it would ſeem very ridiculous for <hi>Antony,</hi> the greateſt Captain of the World, to make no uſe of his well diſciplin'd and ſtout Troops, but to ſcatter them, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them uſeleſs in the defence of a Navy; but for all this, <hi>Cleopatra</hi> prevail'd that a Sea-fight ſhould determine of all, having then an eye to flight, and ordering all her affairs, not as if ſhe had the leaſt thought of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but how ſhe might, when all was loſt, make her eſcape with greateſt ſafety. There was a long neck of Land, which from the Camp ran into the Sea, where the Fleet rid at anchor; here <hi>Antony</hi> uſed to walk without ſuſpecting any danger, but <hi>Caeſar</hi> upon infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from a Servant that it was not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to ſurprize him, laid an ambuſh, which riſing up ſomewhat too haſtily, ſeized the Man that came juſt before him, he himſelf eſcaping narrowly by flight; when it was reſolved to ſtand to a Fight at Sea, they ſet

fire of all, but ſixty of the beſt <hi>Egyptian</hi> Veſſels, and theſe he mann'd with twenty thouſand armed Men, and two thouſand Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers: Here it is reported of a foot Captain, well experienc'd in War, and one that had fought often under <hi>Antony,</hi> and had his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy all mangled with wounds, that he ſhould cry out, <hi>O moſt noble General, why do you mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt theſe Wounds and Swords you ſee, to put your confidence in rotten Wood, let</hi> Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians <hi>and</hi> Phoenicians <hi>contend at Sea, give us the Land where we will die upon the ſpot or gain the victory:</hi> To which he anſwer'd nothing, but by his look, and motion of his hand, ſeeming to bid him be of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, he paſſed forwards having no opinion of the poſture of affairs; and when the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters propos'd the leaving of Sails behind them, he commanded they ſhould be put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, <hi>for we muſt not,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>let one Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my eſcape.</hi> That day, and the three follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Sea was ſo rough they could not engage, but on the fifth there was a calm, and then they fought. <hi>Antony,</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Publicola</hi> the right, and <hi>Celius</hi> the left Squadron. <hi>Marcus Octavius</hi> and <hi>Marcus Juſtius</hi> the middle Squadron. <hi>Octavius</hi> had given the charge of the left Squadron to <hi>Agrippa</hi> commanding in perſon the right: As for the Land Forces, <hi>Canidius</hi> was Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for <hi>Antony; Taurus</hi> for <hi>Caeſar,</hi> both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:36410:116"/>
being drawn up in great order all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Shoar. <hi>Antony</hi> in a ſmall Veſſel went from one Ship to another encouraging his Soldiers, and adviſing them to ſtand firm, and that the largeneſs of the Ships would render the fight, as fix'd as if they were at Land: To the Maſters he order'd that they ſhould receive the Enemy lying ſtill as at Anchor, and maintain the entrance of the Port, which was a dangerous Paſs. They relate of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that going out of his Tent before day in order to viſit his Fleet, that he met a Man driving an Aſs, and asking his name, he told him it was <hi>Eutychus</hi> (which ſignifies fortunate) and my Aſs, ſays he, is called <hi>Nicon</hi> (which is Conquerour;) and afterwards when he diſpoſed the Beaks of the Ships in that place in token of his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, the Statue of this Man and his Aſs in Braſs were placed amongſt them, having viewed his whole Fleet, and from the right Squadron diſcovering the Enemies poſture, he much admired the quiet order they were in, for in all appearance they ſeemed as if they had been at Anchor; and therefore he ſlack'ned his courſe, for they were not above half a League from one another; about noon a gentle Southern Wind did blow, and then <hi>Antony</hi>'s Men being weary of expecting the Enemy ſo long, and truſting to their large tall Veſſels, as if they had been invincible,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:36410:117"/>
began to advance the left Squadron. <hi>Caeſar</hi> was overjoyed to ſee them move, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the right Squadron to retire, that he might get out to Sea as far as he could, his deſign being to encompaſs him round with his light Gallies that were full mann'd; the Enemy being ſcarce able to move by reaſon of their great bulk, and in proportion to their bigneſs being very ill furniſh'd with Seamen and Soldiers. When they engaged there was no ſtriking of one Ship againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, becauſe <hi>Antony</hi>'s Ships, by reaſon of their great burthen, were uncapable of being in a quick motion, by which the ſtroke is made effectual; on the other ſide, <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Ships durſt not ſtrike upon the head of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi>'s, which were all arm'd with Spikes of Iron, nor durſt they give upon the Sides, by reaſon they were made of ſtrong ſquare pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Timber faſten'd together with Maſſy Pins of Iron. So that this engagement reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a Land Fight, or that I may ſpeak more properly the attack of ſome ſtrong place, for there were always three or four Veſſels about one of <hi>Antony</hi>'s, preſſing them with Pikes, Javelins, Darts, and ſeveral inventions of Fire, which they flung among them: <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi>'s Men pouring upon them with their Machines from off their Wooden Towers. <hi>Agrippa</hi> drawing out the Squadron under his command, to hem in the Enemy, <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licola</hi>

was oblig'd to obſerve his motions and deſert the middle Squadron, which was ſore preſled by <hi>Arruntius,</hi> Fortune not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving yet determined on the day; when on a ſudden <hi>Cleopatra</hi> with her ſixty Sail was ſeen to make out to Sea, and to take her way quite through the Ships that were engaged, for they were placed behind the great Ships, which in breaking through they put to great diſorder, the Enemy was aſtoniſhed to ſee them with a fair wind to make for <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſus:</hi> Here it was that <hi>Antony</hi> betray'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; here his behaviour was ſo below the Character of a Captain, nay, indeed of any thing that was Man, and much more below himſelf, that he confirm'd what has former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been obſerv'd, that a Lover's Soul lives in another body, for as if he had been born part of her, and ſo to be carried whereſoever ſhe went, as ſoon as he ſaw her Ship under Sail, he abandoned all that were to ſpend their lives for him, and put himſelf aboard a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of five Ranks of Oars, taking with him only <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Scellius,</hi> to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her that had ſo well began his ruine, and would be ſure to accompliſh it. She perceiving him to follow, gave the ſignal to come aboard; ſo ſoon as he came up with them, he was helped into the Ship, but without ſeeing her, he ſets himſelf down very melancholy in the Stern, with both his

hands ſupporting his head; in the mean while, <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s light Ships that were in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of <hi>Antony,</hi> came into ſight, but <hi>Antony</hi> commanding to tack about they all gave back, but one <hi>Eurycles</hi> the <hi>Laconian</hi> a ſtout fellow, who from off the Deck ſhaked his Lance in a very threatning poſture. <hi>Antony</hi> ſtanding at the Stern, demanded of him, who he was that purſued him ſo hard: <hi>I am,</hi> ſays he, Eurycles <hi>the Son of</hi> Lachares <hi>arm'd with</hi> Caeſar'<hi>s Fortune to revenge my Father's death.</hi> This <hi>Lachaesr</hi> had been condemned to death by <hi>Antony</hi> for a robbery; but he did not venture to attack <hi>Antony,</hi> but ran with his full force upon the other Admiral, for there were two Ships ſo diſtinguiſhed, and with the blow turn'd her round and took her and another Ship, wherein was all his rich Plate and Furniture: So ſoon as <hi>Eurycles</hi> was gone, <hi>Antony</hi> returned to his poſture and ſate ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; thus he behaved himſelf for three days, either angry or aſham'd, and then arriv'd at <hi>Tenarus.</hi> There the Ladies that were intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with their moſt important Affairs, firſt brought them to ſpeak together, then to eat, and at laſt perſwaded them to lie together; ſeveral Ships, and many of his friends fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, and brought him the news of his Fleets being quite deſtroy'd, but that the Land Forces did yet ſtand firm, ſo that he ſent Meſſengers to <hi>Canidius</hi> to march his

Army through <hi>Macedonia</hi> into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and deſigning to go from <hi>Tenarus</hi> to <hi>Africk,</hi> he gave one of the larger Ships laden with vaſt Summs of Money, and Veſſels of Silver and Gold of an ineſtimable price, to his friends, deſiring them to ſhare it amongſt them, and provide for their own ſafety; they refuſing his kindneſs with tears in their eyes, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted them with all the goodneſs and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity imaginable, intreating them to retire, and writ Letters in their behalf to <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> his Steward at <hi>Corinth;</hi> that he would provide for their ſecurity, and keep them conceal'd till ſuch time, as they could make their Peace with <hi>Caeſar.

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:36410:119"/>
Horſe upon the Sea-ſhore, could ſo baſely deſert them, and he above all the world, who had ſo often ſeen Fortune in all her ſhapes, and been ſo accuſtomed to changes: His Soldiers who did paſſionately deſire his arrival, ſtill fancying he would appear from ſome part or other, gave great Teſtimony of their generous fidelity to his ſervice, who when they were throughly perſwaded that he was fled in earneſt, kept themſelves in a body ſeven days, making no account of the Embaſſadors that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſent to them, but at laſt, ſeeing that <hi>Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> himſelf, who commanded them, was fled from the Camp by Night, and that the chief Officers had abandon'd them, They put themſelves into the hands of him that was ſtrongeſt. After this <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſet ſail for <hi>Athens,</hi> where he made a peace with <hi>Greece,</hi> making a diſtribution of the proviſion of Corn which <hi>Antony</hi> had made for his Army, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Grecian</hi> Cities which were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to extreme poverty; having been rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of their Money, their Slaves, their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and all their Beaſts of Service.

they were upon the ſecond expedition, news came of <hi>Antony</hi>'s defeat, this ſaved <hi>Cheronea,</hi> for the perſons concern'd in the General's affairs, and all the Soldiers fled upon this news, and left the Inhabitants to divide the Corn amongſt them.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Antony</hi> came into <hi>Libya,</hi> from the Town of <hi>Paretonium,</hi> he ſent <hi>Cleopatra</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſtaid himſelf in a very ſolitary condition, having no Company but two of his familiar friends, the one <hi>Ariſtocraces</hi> a <hi>Grecian,</hi> the other <hi>Lucilius</hi> a <hi>Roman.</hi> We have already ſpoken of the laſt in the life of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and how that to give him leiſure to eſcape at the Battel of <hi>Philippi,</hi> he ſuffer'd himſelf to be taken, pretending to be <hi>Brutus.

               <p>To add to the afflictions of <hi>Antony,</hi> he underſtood, that he who commanded for him in <hi>Libya,</hi> to whoſe care he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all the Troops of that Country, was gone over to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> there he had a great mind to kill himſelf, but was hindred by his friends, and coming to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he found <hi>Cleopatra</hi> buſied in a moſt prodigious enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.

had formed a project of dragging her Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies over this Neck of Land, and of ſetting them on Float in the Red-Sea, with all her riches aboard to ſeek ſome remote Country, where ſhe might live in peace, ſecure from War and Slavery: But the firſt Gallies which were carried over, being burnt by the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> of <hi>Petra,</hi> and <hi>Antony</hi> not knowing, but that the Army before <hi>Actium</hi> ſtood yet firm; ſhe deſiſted from her enterpriſe, and gave orders for the fortifying all the avenues of her Kingdom, but <hi>Antony</hi> leaving the City and the converſation of his friends, built him a houſe nigh <hi>Pharos</hi> upon a little Mount, which he had caſt up in the Sea, and there ſecluding himſelf from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of mankind, he reſolved to imitate the life of <hi>Timon,</hi> becauſe he had received the ſame hard uſage; and that for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and injuries, which he ſuffer'd from thoſe he had obliged and eſteemed his friends, he would hate and miſtruſt all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>

ſaluted him and embraced him. <hi>Ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus</hi> was aſtoniſh'd and demanding the reaſon; <hi>Oh,</hi> ſays <hi>Timon, you cannot imagine what miſchief this young Man will one day do the</hi> Athenians: He never admitted any one into his Company, but this <hi>Apemantus,</hi> who was much of the ſame humour, and a zealous imitator of his way of Life.

               <p>Thus much of <hi>Timon,</hi> of whom much more might be ſaid. <hi>Canidius</hi> brought <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> word of the loſs of his Army which was before <hi>Actium;</hi> then he received news that <hi>Herod</hi> of <hi>Judea</hi> was gone over to <hi>Caeſar</hi> with very conſiderable Troops, that ſeveral great Commanders had deſerted him, and that his intereſt was quite ruin'd every where: All this did not in the leaſt move him, but quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all hope that he might be rid of all care, and leaving his habitation by the Sea, which he call'd the <hi>Timonium,</hi> he was received by <hi>Cleopatra</hi> in the Palace, and the whole City was diverted by him with feaſting, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and preſents.

and luxury, and called it the Diers together; for all thoſe that would die with <hi>Antony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> gave in their Names, paſſing their time in all manner of pleaſures, and treating one another by turns. But <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was buſied in making a collection of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of poyſonous drugs, and deſirous to know which of them were the leaſt painful in the Operation, ſhe ſent them to be tried upon ſuch as were condemn'd to die, but finding that thoſe poiſons that had a quick effect cauſed ſharp pains and great convulſions, and that the milder were ſo very long a working, ſhe ſet her ſelf to the examination of venomous Creatures, applying one ſort to one Body, and another to others; and this was her daily practice, ſtill finding that nothing was comparable to the bite of the Aſp, which, without the leaſt convulſion or groaning, cauſed a great heavineſs in the head and deſire of ſleep with a gentle ſweat all o'er the Face, the ſenſes being ſtupify'd by degrees; the patient in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, being ſenſible of no pain, but rather troubled to be diſturb'd or awaken'd, like thoſe that are in a profound natural ſleep.

He ſent back with the Ambaſſadors his own Servant <hi>Thyreus</hi> a Man of no ordinary parts, and not unlikely to ſucceed, coming from an Emperour in his youth to a vain Woman eaſily puſt up with her own prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:36410:122"/>
and putting ſo great truſt in her Charms. This Man making his audience much longer than ordinary, and receiving great honours from her, made <hi>Antony</hi> very jealous; ſo that he order'd him to be firſt whipp'd, and then ſent back to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him word, he had been provok'd by his proud inſolent Carriage, and that a Man in his Circumſtances was no great Maſter of his paſſions, but that if he took it ill, he had his Servant <hi>Hipparchus</hi> by him, whom he might uſe after the ſame manner, that they might be upon even Terms. But <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> that ſhe might make atonement for her own indiſcretion, and lay his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, made all the ſubmiſſion imaginable: When her Birth-day came, ſhe kept it as was ſuitable to their deplorable Fortune; but his was obſerv'd with great ſplendor and magnificence, ſo that many of the Gueſts ſate down in great want, and went home wealthy Men.

               <p>WHoever it was, <hi>Soſſius,</hi> that wrote the Poem in praiſe of <hi>Alcibia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> upon his winning the Horſe race at the <hi>Olympian</hi> Games, whether it were <hi>Euripides,</hi> (as 'tis moſt commonly reported) or ſome other perſon, he ſays, That to a Man's being happy, it is in the firſt place requiſite he ſhould be born in ſome famous City; But for him that would attain unto true happineſs, which for the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:36410:133"/>
moſt part is placed in the qualities and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the mind, it is in my opinion, of no other diſadvantage to be of a mean obſcure Country, than to be born of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that is uncomely and low of ſtature. For it were ridiculous to think that <hi>Julis</hi> a little part of <hi>Ceos,</hi> which it ſelf is no great <hi>Iſland;</hi> and that <hi>Aegina,</hi> which a certain <hi>Athenian</hi> once ordered to be removed, as a ſmall eye ſore, out of the Haven of <hi>Piraeus,</hi> ſhould breed good Actors and Poets, and yet ſhould never be able to afford a Juſt, Temperate, Wiſe, and Valiant Man. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arts indeed, whoſe end it is to acquire Riches or Honour, are ſikely enough to wither and decay in poor obſcure Towns; but Vertue like a ſtrong and durable plant takes root and thrives in any place, where it can lay hold of an ingenuous Nature, and a mind that is induſtrious. Wherefore if either in our judgment of things, or courſe of Life, we fall ſhort of what we ought to do, ſuch failer we may juſtly attribute to our ſelves, and not to the meanneſs of our Country.—</p>

Upon which occaſion, that which happened to me, may ſeem ſtrange, though it be true; for it was not ſo much by the knowledge of Words, that I came to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Things, as, having gained ſome ſort of experience in Things, by this means I attained to the ſignification of Words.

So that if there were a Trial of Skill between Nature and Fortune, as there is ſometimes between Artiſts, it would be very hard to judge, whether that made theſe men more alike in their Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and Manners, or, this in their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures and affairs.—</p>

                  <note place="margin">His E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</note> being as yet but ſeven years old, was left by his Father in a plentiful conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; (for the whole Value of his Eſtate was little ſhort of fifteen Talents:) But he was injur'd by his Guardians, part of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune <note place="margin">Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> being by them imbezzled, and the reſt neglected; inſomuch that even his Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were defrauded of their Salaries. This was the reaſon that he had not ſo liberal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, and wanted ſuch Learning as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an ingenious Youth: Beſides that, his Mother, for the tenderneſs and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Body, did not put him upon La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, nor did his Maſters force him. He <note place="margin">Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> was thin and ſickly from the beginning of his Age; and 'tis ſaid, that in reſpect of his Bodily Infirmities, the Boys in ſcorn put upon him the reproachful Nick-name <note place="margin">Nick-names. <hi>Batalus.</hi>
                  </note> of <hi>Batalus;</hi> now this <hi>Batalus</hi> (as ſome ſay) was a weak effeminate Piper; and <hi>Antipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> made a Play on this Subject, in deriſion of him: Others make mention of <hi>Batalus,</hi>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:36410:135"/>
as a Poet, who wrote wanton Songs and Lampoons; and it ſhould ſeem that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain part of the Body, not fit to be named, was about that time, called <hi>Batalus</hi> by the <hi>Athenians.</hi> But the Name of <hi>Argas</hi> (for <note place="margin">Argas.</note> this alſo they report to have been a Nick-name of <hi>Demoſthenes)</hi> was put upon him for his Behaviour, as being fierce and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe (for ſome of the Poets call a Serpent <hi>Argas)</hi> or for his way of ſpeaking, which was offenſive to his Hearers; (for <hi>Argas</hi> was alſo the Name of a Poet, who made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bad and harſh Sonnets.) But ſo much for this, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſays.</p>
               <p>The firſt occaſion of his eager inclination <note place="margin">The firſt beginning of his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</note> to Oratory, they ſay was this; <hi>Calliſtratus</hi> the Orator, being to plead in open Court for <hi>Oropus,</hi> the expectation of the Iſſue of that Cauſe was very great, as well for the Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Orator, who had then a moſt flouriſhing Reputation, as alſo for the Fame of the Action it ſelf. Therefore <hi>Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> having heard the Tutors and School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters agree among themſelves to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at this Trial; with much importunity he perſwades his Tutor to take him along with him to the Hearing; who having ſome Acquaintance with the Door-keepers, eaſily procur'd a place where the Boy might ſit unſeen, and hear what was ſaid. <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus</hi> having got the Day, and being much
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:36410:136"/>
admired, the Boy began to look upon his Glory with a kind of Emulation, obſerving how he was Courted on all hands, and magnified by the Multitude. But much more did he wonder at the ſorce of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence, able to ſubdue and win over any thing. From this time therefore bidding Farewell to other ſorts of Learning and Puerile Diſciplines, he now began to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe himſelf, and to take pains in Declaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as one that meant indeed to be an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator: He made uſe of <hi>Iſaeus</hi> as his Guide <note place="margin">What Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters he bad.</note> to the Art of ſpeaking, though <hi>Iſocrates</hi> at that time kept a School: Whether (as ſome ſay) becauſe he was an Orphan, and was not able to pay <hi>Iſocrates</hi> his Salary, being 10 <hi>l.</hi> or becauſe he preferred <hi>Iſaeus</hi> his way of ſpeaking, as being more effectual, and ſit for Uſe and Buſineſs. But <hi>Hermippus</hi> ſaith, That he met with certain Memoirs without any Author's Name, in which it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> was a Scholar to <hi>Plato,</hi> and by him was much furthered in the Study of Eloquence: And he alſo menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>Cteſibius,</hi> as reporting from <hi>Callias</hi> of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and ſome others, that <hi>Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> ſecretly got, and throughly learned the Arts of <hi>Iſocrates</hi> and <hi>Alcidamas.—</hi>

Subterfuges and Tricks to renew the Suits. But <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> (as <hi>Thucydides</hi> has it) being thus exerciſed by declaiming, and ſucceeding in it, though not without ſome toil and hazard, could not for all this reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any conſiderable part of his Father's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; however attaining hereby to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in Speaking, and ſome competent experience in it, and having got a taſte of the Honour and Power which are acquired by Pleadings; he now ventured to come ſorth, and to undertake Publick Buſineſs. And as 'tis ſaid of <hi>Laomedon</hi> the <hi>Orchomeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> that by advice of his Phyſician, he uſed to run long Stages for the curing of ſome indiſpoſition of his Spleen, and by that means, having through Labour and Exerciſe fram'd the Habit of his Body, betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the <hi>Garland-Games,</hi> and became one of the principal Runners at the long Race: So it happened to <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> who firſt applying himſelf to Oratory for recovery of his own private Eſtate, and ſo getting an ability of ſpeaking; at length, in publick Buſineſs, as it were, in thoſe <hi>Games,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to have the pre-eminence of all thoſe <note place="margin">Begins to plead pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly.</note> Citizens who contended for Maſtery in Pleading at the Bar.

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he met with great Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <note place="margin">His diſcou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ragements</note> and was derided for his odd and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:36410:137"/>
uncouth way of ſpeaking; for his Periods were confus'd, and his Arguments forc'd, which made all ſeem very harſh and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Beſides, he had (it ſeems) a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his Voice, a perplex'd and indiſtinct Utterance, and a ſhortneſs of Breath, which by breaking and disjoynting his Sentences, much obſcur'd the ſence and meaning of what he ſpoke: So that in the end, being quite diſheartned, he forſook the Aſſembly; and as he was walking careleſly, and ſaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering about the <hi>Piraeum, Eunomus</hi> the <hi>Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſian</hi> (then a very old Man) ſeeing him, upbraided him, as one who having a way of ſpeaking much like that of <hi>Pericles,</hi> through ſoftneſs of Mind, and Cowardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was wanting to himſelf; neither bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up with Courage againſt popular Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, nor fitting his Body for Action, but ſuffering it to flagg and languiſh through meer Sloth and Negligence. Another time, when he was exploded the Aſſembly, and went home with his Head muffled up, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it very heavily, they report, that <hi>Satyrus</hi> the Actor, followed him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his familiar Acquaintance, fell into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him: To whom, when <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes</hi> bemoaned himſelf, that having been the moſt induſtrious of all the Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and having almoſt ſpent the wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Employment, he could not yet find any acceptance with the People; that drunken Sots, Mariners, and illiterate Fellows were heard, and poſſeſſed the Pulpit, while he himſelf was deſpiſed. You ſay true <hi>(Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes)</hi> replied <hi>Satyrus,</hi> but I will quickly remedy the Cauſe of all this, if you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat to me ſome Sentence out of <hi>Euripides</hi> or <hi>Sophocles:</hi> Which when <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> had pronounced, <hi>Satyrus</hi> preſently taking it up after him, ſo humour'd and rendred the ſame Sentence with ſuch a becoming Mien and Geſture, that to <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> it ſeemed quite another thing. By this being convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced how much Grace and Ornament ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues to Speech from due Action, he began to eſteem it a ſmall matter, and as good as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for a Man to exerciſe himſelf in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming, if he neglected Pronunciation, and the Decency of Speaking. Hereupon, he built himſelf a place to ſtudy in under <note place="margin">His ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</note> ground (which ſtill remains with us.) And hither he would come conſtantly every day to form his Action, and to exerciſe his Voice, and here he would continue oftentimes, without intermiſſion two or three Months together, ſhaving one half of his Head, that ſo for ſhame he might not go abroad, tho' he deſired it never ſo much. Nor was this all; but he alſo made his Converſation with People abroad, his Diſcourſe, and his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:36410:138"/>
ſubſervient to his Studies, taking from hence Occaſions and Arguments as Matter to work upon. For as ſoon as he was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his Company, down he would go preſently into his Study, and run over eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing in order that had paſſed, and the Reaſons that might be alledg'd for and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. Beſides, ſuch Speeches as he was preſent at, he would recollect with himſelf, and reduce into Periods; and whatever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpoke to him, or he to them, he would correct, tranſlate, and vary ſeveral ways. Hence it was that he was looked upon as a Perſon of no great Natural Wit; but as one who owed all the Power and Ability he had in ſpeaking, to Labour and Induſtry: Of the truth of which, this was no ſmall ſign; that a Man ſhould not lightly hear <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi> ever ſpeak upon the Occaſion, but <note place="margin">Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes <hi>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domſpoke</hi> ex tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</note> though he were by Name frequently called upon by the People as he ſate in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſembly; yet he would not riſe up to plead unleſs he had well conſidered the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and came prepared for it: So that many of the Popular Pleaders uſed to flout at him: And <hi>Pytheas,</hi> once ſcoffing him, ſaid, That his Arguments ſmelt of the Lamp. But <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> replied upon him ſharply; 'Tis true indeed, <hi>Pytheas,</hi> (ſaid he) your Lamp and mine is not conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the ſame things. But to ſome others

he would not much deny this; but would freely confeſs, that in his Pleadings he did neither commit all to Writing, nor yet wholly ſpeak without Notes. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he would affirm, that he ought to be accounted the moſt Popular Speaker who uſed Premeditation; ſuch Preparation being a kind of reſpect to the People; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as to ſlight, and take no care how what is ſaid, is like to be reſented by the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſavours more of an Oligarchick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and of one that intends Force ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Perſwaſion.

                  <hi>Thebans</hi> and <hi>Olythians,</hi> and at the <hi>Olympian Games</hi> recited it publickly; how was it, that he preſently riſing up, and rehearſing hiſtorically and demonſtratively what Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and Advantages all <hi>Greece</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the <hi>Thebans</hi> and <hi>Chalcidians;</hi> and on the contrary, what Miſchiefs the Flatterers of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> had brought upon it; ſo turned the Minds of all that were preſent, that the Sophiſter fearing the Tumult, privily withdrew himſelf out of the Aſſembly? But <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> it ſhould ſeem, thought the other Qualities of <hi>Pericles</hi> to be of little uſe to him; but for his Action and Behaviour, and his forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſpeak on the ſudden, and upon every occaſion, as being the things to which prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally he owed his Greatneſs, theſe he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and endeavoured to imitate; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wholly neglecting the Glory which the preſent occaſion offered, nor yet willing too often to expoſe his Faculty to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Chance.

And in his Houſe he had a large Looking-Glaſs, before which he would ſtand and repeat his Declamations. It is reported,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:36410:140"/>
that a certain Man coming to crave his advice and aſſiſtance, and relating at large what blows he had received from his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary; ſure ſaid <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> thou haſt ſuffered nothing of all this thou talk'ſt of: Upon which the Man ſtraining his Voice and crying out a loud, How, <hi>Demosthenes!</hi> have I ſuffered nothing? I marry, replied he, Now I hear the Voice of one that has been injur'd and beaten. Of ſo great conſequence towards the gaining of belief, did he eſteem the tone and action of the Speaker. The action which he uſed himſelf was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pleaſing to the Common People; but by thoſe of the better ſort (of whom <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius Phalereus</hi> was one) it was looked upon as low, mean, and unmanly. Yet <hi>Hermippus</hi> ſays of <hi>Aeſion,</hi> that being asked his opinion concerning the ancient Orators and thoſe of his own time, he anſwered that one would have wondred to hear thoſe Ancients, with what <hi>decorum</hi> and grandure they addreſs'd themſelves to the People, but the Orations of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> appear moſt admirable upon reading, both for their artificial compoſure and ſtrength of Argument. The Speeches indeed which were penn'd by him, a Man may well ſay, were written with much ſeverity and with ſome kind of bitterneſs; but in his repartees on the ſudden he was uſually facetious and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:36410:141"/>
pleaſant. To <hi>Demades</hi> ſaying <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partees.</note> teach me?

                  <hi>Calchus</hi> attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to upbraid him for ſitting up late, and writing by Candle-light; I know very well, ſaid he, that my Candle troubles you; but wonder not (O ye Men of <hi>Athens)</hi> at the many Robberies which are ſo frequently committed, ſince <hi>we have Thieves of Braſs, and Walls of Clay.</hi> But concerning theſe matters, though we have much more of this kind to ſay, we will here put an end to our Diſcourſe; it being but juſt and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that we now proceed to take an eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of his Nature, and Manners from his actions, and management of Affairs in the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>His firſt entring into publick Buſineſs <note place="margin">His firſt appearing in Civil Affairs.</note> was much about the time of the <hi>Phocian</hi> War, as himſelf affirms, and may be collected from his <hi>Philippick Orations;</hi> For theſe were made ſoon after that Action was over, and the firſt of his Speeches relate to Affairs which hapned very near the ſame time. The Accuſation he had prepared againſt <hi>Meidias</hi> 'tis manifeſt was writ by him when he was but Two and Thirty years old, having as yet no intereſt or reputation in the Common-wealth: And it ſeems to me, that upon this
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:36410:141"/>
Conſideration only, being afraid to proceed, he let fall his Action and was reconcil'd for a Sum of Money. For of himſelf
<q>
                     <l>He was no eaſie or good natur'd Man:</l>
                  </q>
But of a diſpoſition implacable and revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: However, finding it an hard matter and above his ſtrength to deal with <hi>Meidias</hi> a Man ſo well ſecured on all ſides with Money, Eloquence, and Friends, he yielded to the intreaties of thoſe who interceeded for him. But had he ſeen any hopes or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of prevailing, I cannot believe that 3000 Drachma's could have taken off the Edge of his Revenge. The cauſe he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took in the Commonwealth was fair and <note place="margin">The Party of <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes.</hi>
                  </note> juſt; the defence of the <hi>Grecians</hi> againſt <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip;</hi> in which he behaved himſelf ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, that he ſoon grew famous, and was every where admired for his Eloquence and Courage in ſpeaking: He was adored through all <hi>Greece,</hi> the Great King of <hi>Perſia</hi> courted him, and by <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf he was more eſteemed than all the other Orators. His very Enemies were forced to confeſs, that they had to do with a Man of Worth and Honour; for ſuch a Character even <hi>Aeſchines</hi> and <hi>Hyperides</hi> have given him, where they accuſe and ſpeak againſt him. So that I cannot imagine what ground <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opompus</hi>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:36410:142"/>
had to ſay, that <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> was of a wavering unſettled humour, which could not long continue firm either to the ſame Men, or the ſame Affairs; whereas the contrary is moſt apparent; for the ſame par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and way of Government which he held with from the beginning, to thoſe he kept <note place="margin">His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy.</note> conſtant to the end; and was ſo far from leaving them while he lived, that he choſe rather to forſake his life than his Party. He was not heard to Apologize for his ſhifting of ſides like <hi>Demades,</hi> who would ſay, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſpoke againſt himſelf, but never againſt the City. Nor as <hi>Melanopus,</hi> who being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally againſt <hi>Calliſtratus,</hi> but often bribed off with Money, was wont to tell the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, The Man indeed is my Enemy, but we muſt ſubmit for the good of our Country. Neither as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> the <hi>Meſſenian,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt appear'd on <hi>Caſſander</hi>'s ſide, and afterwards took part with <hi>Demetrius,</hi> ſaid, Theſe things were not in themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it being always moſt adviſeable to obey the Conqueror. But we have nothing of this kind to ſay againſt <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> as one who would turn aſide or prevaricate, either in word or deed: For he ſtill kept one conſtant Tenor in his actions, as if they had been all govern'd by one unalterable Scheme of Policy. And <hi>Panetius</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher ſaid, that moſt of his Orations are
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:36410:142"/>
ſo written, as if they were to prove this one concluſion, that what is honeſt and vertuous is for it ſelf only to be choſen; as that <hi>of the Crown,</hi> that <hi>againſt Ariſtocrates,</hi> that <hi>for the Immunities,</hi> and the <hi>Philippicks;</hi> in all which he perſwades his Citizens to purſue not that which ſeems moſt pleaſant, eaſie, or profitable; but declares that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caſes, they ought in the firſt place to preferr that which is juſt and honourable, before their own ſafety and preſervation. So that if he had kept his hands clean from Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, if his courage for the Wars had been anſwerable to the Generoſity of his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and the Excellency of his Orations, he might deſervedly have his Name placed in the higheſt Rank with <hi>Cimon, Thucydides,</hi> and <hi>Pericles,</hi> and not in the Number of ſuch Orators as <hi>Myrocles, Polyeuctus</hi> and <hi>Hyperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi> Therefore amongſt thoſe who ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, <hi>Phocion,</hi> though he appeared on that ſide in the Commonwealth which was not ſo well eſteem'd of, and ſeem'd to favour the <hi>Macedonians;</hi> yet for his Valour and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, he was thought a Perſon no way infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to <hi>Ephialtus, Ariſteides</hi> and <hi>Cimon:</hi> But <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> being neither fit to be at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied <note place="margin">Not free from Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery.</note> on for his Courage in Arms, (as <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> ſays) nor on every ſide well fortified againſt Bribery, (for how invincible ſoever he was againſt the giſts of <hi>Philip</hi> and the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:36410:143"/>
                  <hi>Macedonians,</hi> yet lying open to aſſaults, and being over-power'd by the Gold, which came down from <hi>Suſa</hi> and <hi>Ecbatana)</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared that he was much better able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend than to imitate the Vertues of our Anceſtors. And yet (excepting only <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion)</hi> even in his Life and Manners he far ſurpaſſed the other Orators of his time. None of them diſcourſed to the People with <note place="margin">His free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Speech to the People</note> ſo great freedom and boldneſs: He would not ſpare their faults, but oppoſed himſelf againſt the unreaſonable deſires of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude (as may be gathered from his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.) And <hi>Theopompus</hi> writes that the <hi>Athenians</hi> having by Name appointed <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes,</hi> and calling upon him to accuſe a certain Perſon, he refus'd to do it: Upon which the Aſſembly being all in an uproar, he roſe up and ſaid, <hi>Your Counſellor whether you will or no (O ye Men of</hi> Athens) <hi>you ſhall always have me, but a Sycophant or falſe Accuſer, though you would have me, I ſhall never be.</hi> His carriage in the Caſe of <hi>Antipho</hi> was plainly Ariſtocratical; whom, after he had been acquitted in the Aſſembly, he took and brought before the Court of <hi>Areiopagus,</hi> and, ſetting at naught the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of the People, convicted him of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving promiſed <hi>Philip</hi> to burn the <hi>Arſenal;</hi> whereupon the Man was condemned by that Court and ſuffered for it. He accuſed

alſo <hi>Theoris</hi> the <hi>Prieſteſs,</hi> amongſt many other miſdemeanors, for having inſtructed and taught the Slaves to deceive and cheat their Maſters, for which the Sentence of Death paſs'd upon her, and ſhe was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

Of his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which were made in publick to the People, that againſt <hi>Androtion,</hi> and the other againſt <hi>Timocrates</hi> and <hi>Ariſtocratus</hi> was written for others, before he dealt himſelf in Affairs of the Common-wealth, for theſe it ſeems were publiſhed by him, when he was yet but Seven or Eight and Twenty years old. That againſt <hi>Ariſtogeiton,</hi> and that for the <hi>Immunities</hi> he ſpake himſelf, at the requeſt (as he ſays) of <hi>Creſippus</hi> the Son of <hi>Chabtias,</hi> but, as ſome ſay, out of Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the young Man's Mother; though he never married her: For his Wife was a Woman of <hi>Samos,</hi> as <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſian</hi>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:36410:144"/>
writes in his Book, <hi>de Synonymis.</hi> It is not certain whether his Oration againſt the <hi>Embaſſie of Aeſchines</hi> was ever ſpoken; although <hi>Idomeneus</hi> ſays, that <hi>Aeſchines</hi> wanted only Thirty Voices to acquit him; but this ſeems not to be true, at leaſt ſo far as may be conjectured from both their Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions writ <hi>concerning the Crown:</hi> For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them hath mention'd any thing clearly or directly of it, as a Cauſe that ever came to Trial. But let others decide this Controverſie.</p>
               <p>Now it was evident even in times of <note place="margin">Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Philip.</note> Peace, what courſe <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> would ſtear in the Commonwealth: For whatever was done by the <hi>Macedonian</hi> he could not forbear finding fault with it; but upon all occaſions was ſtirring up the People of <hi>Athens,</hi> and inflaming them againſt him: Therefore in the Court of <hi>Philip,</hi> no Man was ſo much talk'd of, or of ſo great account as he: And when he came thither one of the Ten Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, who were ſent into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> though all had Audience given them, yet his Speech was anſwered with moſt care and exactneſs: But in other reſpects <hi>Philip</hi> entertain'd him not ſo honourably as the reſt, neither did he ſhew him the ſame kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and civility with which he applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the party of <hi>Aeſchines</hi> and <hi>Philocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:</hi> So that when the others commended
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:36410:144"/>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> as an able Speaker, a beautiful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nay, and as a good Companion that could drink ſtoutly; <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> could not contain himſelf from Railery and Scoffing at the Praiſes they gave him: The firſt, he ſaid was a quality which might well enough become a Rhetorician, the ſecond a Woman, and the laſt was only the property of a Spunge; but none of them any away ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Character or Commendation of a Prince. When things look'd towards a War, <hi>(Philip</hi> on the one ſide being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to live in peace, and the <hi>Athenians</hi> on the other ſide, being ſtirr'd up by <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes)</hi> the firſt Action he put them upon, was the reducing of <hi>Eubaea,</hi> which by the Treachery of the Governors was brought under ſubjection to <hi>Philip.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he having procured a Decree, they croſs'd over thither and chaſed the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> out of the Iſland. The next was the Relief of the <hi>Byzantines</hi> and <hi>Perinthians</hi> with whom the <hi>Macedonians</hi> at that time made War. He perſwaded the People to lay aſide their enmity againſt thoſe Nations, to forget the offences committed by them in the Wars with their Confederates, and to ſend them ſuch Succours as ſaved and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them. Not long after, he undertook an Embaſie to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> whom he ſolicited and ſo for incens'd againſt <hi>Philip,</hi> that (a
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:36410:145"/>
few only excepted) he wrought them all into a general inſurrection: ſo that beſides the Forces to be raiſed by the Cities, there was an Army conſiſting of 15000 Foot and 2000 Horſe, and the Money to pay theſe Strangers, was levied and brought in with great chearfulneſs; but when the Allies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that their contributions for the War might be aſcertain'd and ſtated, <hi>Crobylus</hi> the Orator (as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> ſays) told them plainly, <hi>That War could not be kept to any ſet diet.</hi> Now was all <hi>Greece</hi> up in Arms, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licites and prevails with the <hi>Thebans.</hi>
                  </note> and in great expectation what would be the event of theſe things. The <hi>Eubaeans,</hi> the <hi>Achaians,</hi> the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the <hi>Magarians,</hi> the <hi>Leucadians,</hi> and <hi>Corcyraeans,</hi> their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and their Cities were all joyn'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a League: But the hardeſt task was yet behind left for <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> to draw the <hi>Thebans</hi> into this Confederacy with the reſt. Their Country border'd next upon <hi>Attica,</hi> they had great Forces for the War, and at that time they were accounted the beſt Soldiers of all <hi>Greece,</hi> but it was no ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie matter to make them break with <hi>Philip,</hi> who by many good Offices had ſo lately obliged them in the <hi>Phocian</hi> War; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidering the quarrels and diſputes between theſe two Cities, occaſion'd from the nearneſs of their Frontiers, and by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent light skirmiſhes on both ſides dayly

renewed and exaſperated. But after <hi>Philip,</hi> being now grown high and puffed up with his good ſucceſs at <hi>Amphiſſa,</hi> had on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſurprized <hi>Elataea,</hi> and poſſeſſed himſelf of <hi>Phocis,</hi> the <hi>Athenians</hi> were under a great conſternation, none durſt venture up into the Pulpit, or knew what to ſay, all were at a loſs, and the whole Aſſembly in deep ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and great perplexity. In this extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of affairs, <hi>Demosthenes</hi> was the only Man who appear'd, adviſing to apply themſelves to the <hi>Thebans;</hi> and having otherways en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the People, and (as his manner was) raiſed their ſpirits up with hopes, he with ſome others, was ſent Embaſſador to <hi>Thebes.</hi> To oppoſe him (as <hi>Marſias</hi> ſays) <hi>Philip</hi> alſo ſent thither his Embaſſadors, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myntas</hi> and <hi>Clearchus</hi> two <hi>Macedonians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Daochus, Theſialus,</hi> and <hi>Thraſydaeus.</hi> Now upon conſultation the <hi>Thebans</hi> were well enough aware what ſuited beſt with their own intereſt; but every one had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Eyes the dreadful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Calamities of War, and the wounds they lately received at <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> were remaining yet green and freſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. But ſuch was the force and power of our Orator (as <hi>Theopompus</hi> tells us) that enkindling their minds, and inſlaming them with a deſire of Glory, he took away their ſight, and caſt a miſt before all other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations; ſo that without farther delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:36410:146"/>
or any regard had to the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which lay upon them, they caſt away all fear, like Men poſſeſs'd, and by his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence inſpired with worthy and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſolutions. This ſo famous an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize accompliſhed by an Orator, was thought to be of ſuch great conſequence, <note place="margin">The Credit of <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Battel.</note> that <hi>Philip</hi> immediately ſent Heralds to treat and deſire a Peace.

The Commanders in chief, not only of <hi>Attica,</hi> but of <hi>Baeotia,</hi> applied themſelves to <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd his directions: He managed all the Aſſemblies as well thoſe of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> as thoſe of the <hi>Athenians:</hi> He was beloved both by the one and by the other, and had the ſame Authority with both. Neither was all this reſpect ſhewed him without good cauſe; for (as <hi>Theopompus</hi> has declar'd) it was no more than was decent and due to his merit. But there was, it ſhould ſeem, ſome fatal deſtiny in the revolution of theſe Affairs, which, having determin'd to put a period at this time to the Liberty of <hi>Greece,</hi> oppos'd and thwarted all their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and by many ſigns foretold what ſhould happen.

there is of Truth in theſe reports. But of <hi>Demosthenes</hi> 'tis ſaid, that he had ſo great confidence in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Forces, and ſeeing the courage and reſolution of ſo many brave Men ready to engage the Enemy, grew ſo high and lofty, that he would by no means endure they ſhould give any heed to Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or hearken to Propheſies, but gave out that he ſuſpected even the Propheteſs her ſelf, as if ſhe had been tamper'd with to ſpeak in favour of <hi>Philip.</hi> The <hi>Thebans</hi> he put in mind of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> of <hi>Pericles,</hi> who always took their own meaſures and govern'd their Actions by reaſon, looking upon ſuch Fopperies as a pretence only for cowardiſe. Thus far therefore, <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> acquitted himſelf like a Man of Honour. But in the Fight when <note place="margin">His Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe in the Fight.</note> it came to blows he did nothing honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor were his performances any way anſwerable to his ſpeeches.

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:36410:147"/>
ſtamping, and dancing, and raiſing his Voice to the meaſures of his feet, he ſung the firſt words of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> his Decree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus ſpoke</hi> Demoſthenes <hi>the Son of</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes <hi>of the</hi> Paeanean <hi>Tribe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when he came to himſelf and had well conſidered the dangerous circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he was lately under, he was ſtruck with horror, reflecting upon the ſtrength and mighty power of ſuch an Orator who had enforced him, within the compaſs of a few hours, to run the hazard both of his Life and Empire. His Fame alſo reached even to the Court of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the King ſent Letters to his Lieutenants, commanding them to feed <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> with Money, and to make their chief application to him, as the only Man of all the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who was beſt able to give <hi>Philip</hi> a diverſion, and to imploy his Forces nearer home in the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of <hi>Greece.</hi> This afterwards came to the knowledge of <hi>Alexander</hi> by certain Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> which he found at <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> and by other Papers of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers expreſſing the vaſt Summs which had been given him.</p>
               <p>At this time upon the ill ſucceſs which <note place="margin">

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:36410:148"/>
to frame ſeveral Informations and Indictments againſt him. But the People not only acquitted him of theſe Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but continued towards him their former reſpects, and as a Man that meant well, they reſtor'd him to the management of their publick Affairs: Inſomuch, that when the Bones of thoſe who had been ſlain at <hi>Cheronea,</hi> were brought home to be ſolemnly interr'd: <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> was the Man they pitched on to make the Funeral Oration. The misfortunes which befel them, they did not bear with a baſe, low, or ignoble mind, but (as <hi>Theopompus</hi> writes in his Tragedies) by the Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects ſhewn to their Counſellour, they made it appear, that they were no way diſſatisfied with the Counſels he had given them. The Speech therefore was ſpoken by <hi>Demoſthenes:</hi> But his decrees he would not have paſs'd in his own name, but made uſe of his Friends one after another; for he look'd upon his own Genius as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate and inauſpicious; till at length he took courage again after the death of <hi>Philip,</hi> who did not long out-live his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at <hi>Cheronea.</hi> And this it ſeems was that which was ſoretold in the laſt Verſe of the Oracle.</p>

                  </note> death of <hi>Philip;</hi> and laying hold of this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to prepoſſeſs the People with Courage, and better Hopes for the future; he came into the Aſſembly with a chearful countenance, pretending to have ſeen a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, from whence the <hi>Athenians</hi> were to expect ſome great Matters; and not long after arrived the Meſſengers, who brought the News of <hi>Philip</hi>'s Death: No ſooner had the People received it, but immediately they offered Sacrifice to the Gods, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſhould be crown'd: <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes</hi> appear'd publickly in a rich Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, with a Chaplet on his Head, though it were but the ſeventh Day ſince the Death of his Daughter (as 'tis ſaid by <hi>Aeſchines)</hi> who upbraids him upon this account, and rails at him as one void of natural affection towards his Children; whereas indeed he has by this means rather betray'd himſelf to be of a poor low Spirit, and effeminate Mind, while he ſeems to make immoderate grief and lamentation, the only ſigns of a gentle and compaſſionate Nature, and to condemn thoſe who bear ſuch Accidents with more temper, and leſs paſſion. For my
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:36410:149"/>
own part, as I cannot ſay that the Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the <hi>Athenians</hi> on this occaſion, was any way decent or honourable, to crown themſelves with Garlands, to ſacrifice to the Gods, and all for the death of a Prince, who in the midſt of his Succeſs and Victories, when they were a conquered Nation, had uſed them with ſo much Clemency and Humanity; (for it was a practice both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and baſe to make him free of their City, and to honour him while he lived; and yet as ſoon as he fell by another's hand, to ſet no bounds to their Jollity, to inſult over him dead, and to ſing triumphant Songs of Victory, as if by their own Valour they had vanquiſh'd him.) So I muſt needs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Carriage of <hi>Demoſthenes;</hi> who leaving vain Tears and Lamentations to the Women, made it his Buſineſs to do that which he thought moſt profitable for the Common-wealth. And I think it the Duty of him, who would be accounted to have a Soul truly valiant, and fit for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that, ſtanding always firm to the common Good, and neglecting his own private Calamities and Affairs, when they come into competition with the Publick, he ſhould maintain the dignity of his Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter and Station; much more than it is of good Actors, who repreſent the Perſons of Kings and Tyrants; and yet theſe, we ſee,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:36410:149"/>
when they either laugh or weep on the Stage, do not follow their own Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but obſerve that <hi>Decorum</hi> in their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Subject requires. Moreover, if we ought not to leave the unfortunate, forlorn, and comfortleſs, overwhelm'd with ſorrow, but to uſe ſome ſuch ſpeeches as may alleviate their Afflictions, and divert their Minds with more pleaſing Objects (as we uſe to adviſe thoſe who are troubled with ſore Eyes, to withdraw their ſight from bright and offenſive Colours, to Green, and thoſe of a ſofter mixture.) From whence can a Man furniſh himſelf with better Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of Conſolation for the Afflictions of his Family, than by endeavouring to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper and allay his own private Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes with the good ſucceſs and recovery of his Countrey out of publick Calamities; that ſo the better Fortune of the one may in ſome meaſure obſcure and conceal the ill Circumſtances of the other.</p>
               <p>I have been the larger in this Digreſſion, becauſe I obſerve in a Speech of <hi>Aeſchines</hi> upon this Subject, that he endeavours to move, and ſoften the Minds of the People with Womaniſh Pity and Commiſeration.</p>

               <p>He had not fled far from the City, when finding that he was purſued by ſome of thoſe Citizens who had been his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he endeavoured to hide himſelf.

Inſomuch that there remain upon record ſome Sayings of his, no way ſuitable to that generoſity and bravery, with which he uſed to expreſs himſelf, when he had the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Common-wealth. For as he was departing out of the City, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that he lifted up his hands towards the <hi>Acropolis,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>O Lady</hi> Minerva, <hi>how is it that thou takeſt delight in three ſuch fierce untractable Beaſts, the Owl, the Dragon, and the People?</hi> The young men that came to viſit, and converſe with him, he deterr'd from medling with State-affairs, telling them, that if at firſt two ways had been propos'd to him, the one leading to the Pulpit and the Aſſembly, the other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly tending to Deſtruction, and he could have foreſeen the many Evils which attend thoſe who deal in publick Buſineſs, ſuch as Fears, Envies, Calumnies, and Contentions, he would certainly have taken that which led ſtraight on to his Death.</p>
               <p>But now hapned the Death of <hi>Alexander</hi> while <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> was in this kind of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which we have been ſpeaking of.

                  <note place="margin">His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from Exile.</note> were ſo well pleaſed, that they decreed the recalling of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> from baniſhment.

the Haven of <hi>Piraeus,</hi> where he was met, and joyfully received by all the Citizens, not ſo much as the <hi>Archon,</hi> or the Prieſt ſtaying behind.

There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd only his pecuniary Fine, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law could not be remitted by the People. But they found out a way to <note place="margin">His Fine remitted.</note> elude the Law. It was a Cuſtom with them to allow a certain quantity of Silver to thoſe who were to furniſh and adorn the Altar for the Sacrifice of <hi>Jupiter Soter.</hi> This Office for that turn they beſtowed on <hi>Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> and for the performance of it ordered him fifty Talents, the very ſumm in which he was condemned.

as if he ſhould meet with no hard uſage from him. But, <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> in his ſleep, the Night before had an odd unuſual Dream: It ſeem'd to him that he was acting a Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and contended with <hi>Archias</hi> for the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; <note place="margin">

Wherefore as <hi>Archias</hi> was diſcourſing to him with many expreſſions of kindneſs, he ſate ſtill in the ſame poſture, and looking up ſtedfaſtly upon him, <hi>O</hi> Archias <hi>(ſaid he) I was never much taken with your Action here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and now I am as little moved by your Promiſes.

And <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias</hi> drawing near, deſired him to riſe up, and repeating the ſame kind things he had ſpoken before, he once more promiſed him to make his peace with <hi>Antipater.</hi> But <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes,</hi> perceiving that now the Poyſon had pierc'd and ſeized his Vitals, uncovered his Head, and fixing his Eyes upon <hi>Archias.

But <hi>Pappus</hi> a certain Hiſtorian (whoſe Hiſtory was recovered by <hi>Hermippus)</hi> ſays, that as he fell near the Altar, there was found in his Paper this beginning only of a Letter and nothing more, <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> to <hi>Antipater.</hi> The ſuddenneſs of his Death was much wondred at, and the <hi>Thracians</hi> who guarded the Doors, reported that he took the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into his Hand out of a Rag, and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:36410:156"/>
put it in his Mouth, and that they imagined it had been Gold which he ſwallowed. But the Maid that ſerv'd him, being examined by the followers of <hi>Archias,</hi> affirm'd that he had worn it in a Bracelet for a long time as an Amulet. And <hi>Eratoſthenes</hi> himſelf ſays, that he kept the Poyſon in an hollow Ring, and that Ring was the Bracelet which he wore about his Arm. Many and various are the reports of thoſe who have writ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter, which it is no way needful to recount: Yet I muſt not omit what is ſaid by <hi>Democharis,</hi> a familiar inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate acquaintance of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> who is of opinion, it was not by the help of Poyſon that he met with ſo ſudden and ſo eaſie a death; but that by the ſingular favour and providence of the Gods, he was thus reſcued from the barbarous cruelty of the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi> He died the Sixteenth of <hi>October,</hi> a day the moſt ſad and ſolemn of all the year, on which the Women celebrate the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mophoria</hi> of <hi>Ceres,</hi> and faſt all day in the Temple of that Goddeſs.</p>
               <p>Soon after his death the People of <hi>Athens</hi> beſtowed on him ſuch honours as he had <note place="margin">Honours beſtowed on him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death.</note> deſerved. They erected his Statue of Braſs; they decreed that the Eldeſt of his Family ſhould be maintain'd in the <hi>Prytaneum;</hi> and on the Baſe of his Statue was ingraven this famous Inſcription:</p>
               <lg>

               <p>For it is very ridiculous, which by ſome Men is reported, that <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> ſhould make theſe Verſes himſelf in <hi>Calabria,</hi> as he was about to take the Poyſon.</p>
               <p>A little before we came to <hi>Athens,</hi> 'tis ſaid, there hapned ſuch an accident as this.

At length the Soldier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, and finding his Treaſure entire; the fame of this accident was ſpread abroad: And many of the Wits upon this occaſion ſtrove to vindicate <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, in ſeveral Epigrams which they made on the ſame ſubject.</p>

Howſoever he, who firſt of that Houſe was ſirnamed <hi>Cicero,</hi> ſeems to have been a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon worthy to be remembred; becauſe thoſe who ſucceeded him did not only not reject, but were fond of that name, though vulgar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made a matter of reproach.

The young Man being thus deſerted, fled for refuge to <hi>Cicero:</hi> His Friends encouraged him, as never being like again to have a fairer and more honourable introduction to Glory; he therefore undertakes the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, carries the Cauſe and was admired for it.</p>
               <p>But fearing <hi>Sylla,</hi> he travelled into <hi>Greece,</hi> and gives it out, that he did it in order to his health; And indeed he was ſo lean and meagre, and had ſuch a weakneſs in his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, that he could take down nothing but a ſpare and thin Diet, and that not till late in the Evening: His voice was loud and good, but ſo harſh and unmana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that in vehemence and heat of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he always raiſed it to ſo high a tone, that there was reaſon to fear the endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Body by it.</p>
               <p>When he came to <hi>Athens,</hi> he was an Auditor of <hi>Antiochus</hi> the <hi>Aſcalonite,</hi> being taken with the volubility and elegance of his Speech, altho he did not approve the Novelty of his opinions: For <hi>Antiochus</hi> had now fallen off from the new Academy, as they call it, and forſaken the Sect of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neades,</hi> either moved by clear conviction and the evidence of ſenſe, or, as ſome ſay, through ambition and oppoſition to the followers of <hi>Clitomachus</hi> and <hi>Philo,</hi> and had changed his opinion, in moſt things, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing

               <p>But after he had receiv'd the news of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s death, and his body again ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by exerciſe, was come to a vigorous habit, his voice managed and render'd ſweet and full to the Ear, and pretty well fitted to the diſpoſition of his Body, his Friends at <hi>Rome,</hi> earneſtly ſolliciting him by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and <hi>Antiochus</hi> as much perſwading him to return to publick Affairs, he again furbiſh'd up his Rhetorick, as the proper inſtrument of a Stateſman; and re-excited his political faculty, both diligently exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing himſelf in declamations, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the celebrated Orators of that time.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It is reported, that <hi>Apollonius</hi> not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the <hi>Roman</hi> Language, deſired <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> to declaim in <hi>Greek,</hi> and that he readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obey'd him, as knowing it the beſt way to have his defects amended: After he had ended his declamation, others were aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and mutually contended in praiſe of the Orator, but <hi>Apollonius</hi> as he had diſcovered no great tranſport whilſt he heard him, ſo when he had done, he ſate muſing with himſelf for ſome conſiderable time, at which <hi>Cicero</hi> being diſturbed, he ſaid unto him; <hi>Thee, O</hi> Cicero, <hi>I praiſe and admire, but I pity the Fortune of</hi> Greece <hi>to ſee Arts and Eloquence the only Ornaments that were left her, by thee tranſported to the</hi> Romans.</p>
               <p>And now when <hi>Cicero</hi> full of expectation, was again bent upon political affairs, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Oracle blunted the edge of his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for conſulting the God of <hi>Delphos</hi> how he ſhould arrive at the top of Glory, <hi>Pythia</hi> anſwer'd, By making his own genius, and not the opinion of the People the guide of his life; and therefore at firſt he paſſed his time in <hi>Rome</hi> cautiouſly, and was very backward in pretending to publick Offices, ſo that he was at that time in little eſteem, and had got the names of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But being by Nature very deſirous of Fame, and by his Father and Relations alſo incited thereto, he apply'd himſelf to plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in which he arrived at eminence, not by gentle and ſlow degrees, but on a ſudden his glory ſhone forth, and he far ſurpaſs'd all the Advocates of the Bar.</p>
               <p>At firſt it is ſaid, he was, as well as <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes,</hi> very defective in Action, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he diligently apply'd himſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to <hi>Roſcius</hi> the Comedian, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to <hi>Aeſop</hi> the Tragedian.</p>
               <p>They report of this <hi>Aeſop,</hi> that whilſt he was repreſenting on the Theatre <hi>Atraeus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberating the revenge of <hi>Thyeſtes,</hi> he was ſo tranſported beyond himſelf in the heat of Action, that with his Truncheon he ſmote one of the Servants haſtily croſſing the Stage, and laid him dead upon the place.</p>
               <p>And ſuch afterwards was <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Action, that it did not a little contribute to render his Eloquence perſuaſive, deriding the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricians of his time, for delivering their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations with great noiſe, he ſaid it was want of Ability to ſpeak that made them bawl, as lame Men who cannot walk get on horſe-back.</p>
               <p>And indeed his facetious humour in jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and jeſting ſeemed very proper and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:36410:162"/>
at the Bar, but his uſing it to exceſs offended many, and gave him the repute of ill manners.</p>
               <p>He was appointed <hi>Queſtor</hi> in a great ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Corn, and had <hi>Sicily</hi> for his Province, where tho at firſt he diſpleaſed many by compelling them to ſend in their Proviſions to <hi>Rome;</hi> yet after they had had experience of his Care, Juſtice, and Clemency, they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him more than ever they did any of their Governours before.</p>
               <p>Not long after ſome young Men of good and noble Families charged with diſorder and diſſoluteneſs againſt Martial Diſcipline, were ſent back from <hi>Rome</hi> to the Pretor of <hi>Sicily.</hi> But <hi>Cicero</hi> ſo excellently managed their defence, that he got them all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>
               <p>Returning to <hi>Rome</hi> with a great Opinion of himſelf for theſe things, a pleaſant acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent befell him, for lighting upon an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> whom he accounted his Friend, and asking him what the <hi>Romans</hi> ſaid and thought of his Actions, as if the whole City had been fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the noiſe and glory of what he had done, he anſwered, <hi>Why</hi> Cicero <hi>where haſt thou been all this time:</hi> It ſtruck him dead at Heart to perceive, that the report of his Actions was fallen into the City of <hi>Rome</hi> as an immenſe Ocean, without any return of
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:36410:162"/>
publick Glory. And therefore afterwards conſidering with himſelf, that the glory he contended for was an infinite thing, and that there was neither end nor meaſure in ſuch purſuits, he abated much of his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious thoughts: Yet, nevertheleſs he was exceſſively pleaſed with his own praiſe, and continued to the very laſt moſt paſſionately deſirous of Glory; which often interrupted the proſecution of his wiſeſt Reſolutions.</p>
               <p>Applying himſelf more reſolutely to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Buſineſs, he accounted it an abſurd thing that Artificers uſing Veſſels and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments inanimate, ſhould know the Name, Place, and Uſe of every one of them; and yet the Stateſman, who mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth publick Affairs by Men, ſhould be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and careleſs in the knowledge of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and things relating to the Common-wealth; and therefore he not only acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf with the Names, but alſo knew the particular Place where every one of the more eminent Citizens dwelt, what Lands he poſſeſſed, the Friends he made uſe of, and thoſe that were of his Neighbourhood, and when he travelled the road of <hi>Italy,</hi> he could readily name and ſhew the Eſtates and Seats of his Friends.</p>
               <p>Having ſo ſmall an Eſtate, tho a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient competency for his own expences, it was much wondred that he took neither
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:36410:163"/>
Fees nor Gifts from his Clients, more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, that he did it not when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the proſecution of <hi>Verres:</hi> This <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> who had been Pretor of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and ſtood charged by the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> of many evil pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices during his Government there, <hi>Cicero</hi> cauſed to be condemned not by ſpeaking, but in a manner by holding his Tongue. For the Judges favouring <hi>Verres,</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd the Tryal by ſeveral Adjournments to the laſt day, in which it was evident there could not be ſufficient time for the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates to be heard, nor to bring the Cauſe to an Iſſue; <hi>Cicero</hi> ſteps up, and ſaid there was no need of Speeches, and therefore produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and examining Witneſſes he required the Judges to proceed to Sentence.</p>

Now this <hi>Manilius</hi> had the good opinion and favour of the Common People, and was thought to be proſecuted only for <hi>Pompey</hi>'s ſake, whoſe particular Friend he was; and therefore, when he had asked a ſet time for his Tryal, and <hi>Cicero</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him but one Day, and that the next only; the common People grew highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, becauſe it had been the cuſtom of the Pretors to allow Ten Days at leaſt to the Accuſed; when the Tribunes of the People having called him to the Bar, and accuſing him <hi>(of an unuſual Practice)</hi> he deſiring to be heard, ſaid, that as he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways uſed the Accuſed with Equity and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, as far as the Law allowed, ſo he thought it hard to deny the ſame to <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> and that he had ſtudiouſly appointed that day of which only, as <hi>Pretor,</hi> he was Maſter, and that it was not the part of thoſe that were deſirous to help him, to caſt the judgment of his Cauſe upon another <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> Theſe things being ſaid, made a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful change in the People, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him much for it, they deſired that he
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:36410:165"/>
himſelf would undertake the defence of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nilius,</hi> which he willingly conſented to, and that principally for the ſake of <hi>Pompey,</hi> who was abſent, and therefore ſtepping up again, he made an Oration of the whole Matter, from the beginning, briskly reflecting upon the Factious, and the Enemies of <hi>Pompey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet he was preferr'd to the Conſulſhip no leſs by the Nobleſs, than the common People for the good of the City; and both parties joyntly aſſiſted his promotion upon this account. The change of Government made by <hi>Sylla,</hi> which at firſt ſeem'd intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, by time and uſage did now appear to the People, no ill way of ſettlement; there were indeed ſome that endeavoured to alter and ſubvert the preſent State of Affairs, but more for their own private gain than pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> being at this time employ'd in Wars with the Kings of <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> there wanted ſufficient force at <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſuppreſs thoſe that affected change in the Commonwealth: Theſe had for their Head a Man of a bold, daring and reſtleſs Humor, <hi>Lucius Catiline,</hi> who was accuſed beſides o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Offences of deflouring his Virgin Daughter, and killing his own Brother, of which latter fearing to be proſecuted at Law, he perſwaded <hi>Sylla</hi> to ſet him down as though he were yet alive, amongſt
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:36410:166"/>
thoſe that were to be put to death by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
               <p>This Man the profligate Citizens choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for their Captain, gave faith to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, by Sacrificing a Man and eating of his fleſh; and a great part of the young Men of the City were corrupted by him, he providing for every one, Pleaſures, Drink, and Women, profuſely ſupplying the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of thoſe debauches.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Etruria</hi> was in a diſpoſition to revolt, and a great part of <hi>Gallia Ciſalpina,</hi> but <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf was in the moſt dangerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to change, by reaſon of the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual diſtribution of the Wealth of that place, for Perſons of the greateſt Honour and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, had made themſelves poor by ſhews, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, ambition of Offices, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous Buildings, and by this the Riches of the City were fallen into the hands of mean and deſpicable Perſons, ſo that there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but little Weight to remove the Seat of Affairs, it being in the power of every da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Man to overturn a ſickly Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Catiline</hi> being deſirous of procuring a ſtrong Fort in order to his future Deſigns, pretended to the Conſulſhip, and was in great hopes of having <hi>Caius Antonius</hi> for his Collegue, a Man of himſelf, neither a fit Leader for the beſt nor worſt deſigns, but
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:36410:166"/>
ſuch a one as might make a good acceſſion to the others Power: Theſe things the greateſt part of the good and honeſt Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens apprehending, put <hi>Cicero</hi> upon ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Conſulſhip, whom the People readily receiving, <hi>Catiline</hi> was put by, ſo <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>C. Antonius</hi> were choſen, altho amongſt the Competitors <hi>Cicero</hi> was the only Man deſcended from a Father of the <hi>Equeſtrian,</hi> and not of the <hi>Patrician</hi> Order.</p>
               <p>Tho the Deſigns of <hi>Catiline</hi> were not yet publickly known; yet great previous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions immediately followed upon <hi>Cicero</hi>'s entrance upon the Conſulſhip; for on the one ſide, thoſe which were forbidden, by the Laws of <hi>Sylla,</hi> publick Offices, being neither inconſiderable in power nor num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſtood and careſſed the People for them, ſpeaking many things truly and juſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Tyranny of <hi>Sylla,</hi> had they not diſturbed the Government in an improper and unſeaſonable time; on the other ſide, the Tribunes of the People propoſed Laws upon the ſame <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> conſtituting a <hi>Decemvirate</hi> with unaccountable power; with whom, as Lords, ſhould be the Right of ſelling the publick Lands of all <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and whatſoever <hi>Pompey</hi> had newly Conquered, of judging and baniſhing whom they pleaſed, and of planting Colonies, of taking Monies out of the Treaſury, and of
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:36410:167"/>
levying and paying what Soldiers ſhould be thought needful, and therefore ſeveral of the Nobility favoured this Law, but eſpecially <hi>C. Antonius, Cicero</hi>'s Collegue, in hopes of being one of the Ten; but that that gave the greateſt fear to the Nobleſs was, that he was thought privy to the Conſpiracy of <hi>Catiline,</hi> and not to diſlike it, becauſe of his great Debts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> endeavouring in the firſt place to provide a Remedy againſt this danger, got a Decree of the Province of <hi>Macedonia</hi> for <hi>Antonius,</hi> and <hi>Gallia</hi> which was given to himſelf, he relinquiſhed. By this kindneſs he ſo wrought <hi>Antonius</hi> to his beck, that like a hired Player, he was always ready to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond him for the good of his Country, and when he had made him thus tame and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable, <hi>Cicero</hi> with greater courage attacked the affectors of Innovation, and therefore in the Senate, making an Oration againſt the Law of the <hi>Decemvirates,</hi> he ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded thoſe which propoſed it, that they had nothing to reply: But if when they again endeavoured, and having prepared things beforehand, had call'd the Conſuls before the Common Hall; <hi>Cicero</hi> fearing nothing went firſt out, and commanded the Senate to follow him, ſo that he not only threw out the Law, but vanquiſhed the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes</hi> with his Eloquence, that he made them lay aſide all their other pretences.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:36410:167"/>
For <hi>Cicero</hi> was the Man who principally demonſtrated to the <hi>Romans,</hi> how great a reliſh Eloquence gives to that that is good, and how invincible a juſt propoſal is, if it be well ſpoken, and that it is neceſſary for him, who would dextrouſly govern a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, in action always to preferr that which is honeſt before that which is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, and in ſpeaking to ſeparate that which is offenſive, from that that is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
               <p>And there was an accident in the Theatre in the time of his Conſulſhip, which was a demonſtration of the prevalence of his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
               <p>For whereas formerly the Knights of <hi>Rome,</hi> were mingled in the Theatre with the common People, and took their places amongſt them as it happen'd, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vel po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius L. Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Otho</hi> Tribune of the People, for ſo were his Names and Office, and the Law inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that Matter, is ſtiled <hi>Lex Roſcia.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Marcus Otho</hi> the Praetor was the firſt, who in Honour diſtinguiſhed them from the other Citizens, and appointed them a proper Seat, which they ſtill enjoy as their more eminent place in the Theatre: This the common People took as an indignity done to them; and therefore when <hi>Otho</hi> appear'd in the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre, they in reproach hiſſed him; the Knights on the contrary received him with loud clapping, the People repeated and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed their hiſſing; the Knights continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their clapping, upon this turning upon
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:36410:168"/>
one another, they fell to reproaches, ſo that the Theatre was in great diſorder: <hi>Cicero</hi> being informed of it, came himſelf to the Theatre, and ſummoning the People into the Temple of <hi>Bellona,</hi> he ſo effectually chid and chaſtiz'd them for it, that they again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into the Theatre, received <hi>Otho</hi> with a loud applauſe, contending with the Knights who ſhould give the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of honour and reſpect to the Praetor.</p>
               <p>The Conſpiracy of <hi>Catiline</hi> at firſt time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and diſheartned, began again to take courage, and therefore aſſembling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together, they exhorted one another more boldly to undertake the Deſign before <hi>Pompey</hi>'s return, who, as it was ſaid, was now on his March with his Forces for <hi>Rome.</hi> But the <hi>Veterane</hi> Soldiers of <hi>Sylla</hi> were <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiline</hi>'s chiefeſt confidence; theſe had been disbanded all about <hi>Italy,</hi> but the greateſt number and the valianteſt of them lay ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered about the Cities of <hi>Etruria,</hi> dreaming of new Plunder and Rapine amongſt the hoarded Riches of <hi>Italy:</hi> Theſe having for their Leader <hi>Manilius,</hi> who had eminently ſerved in the Wars under <hi>Sylla,</hi> joyn'd themſelves to <hi>Catiline,</hi> and came to <hi>Rome</hi> to aſſiſt him with their Suffrages at the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: For he again pretended to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip, having reſolv'd to kill <hi>Cicero</hi> in the Tumult of the Aſſembly.</p>

Beſides, the Gods ſeem'd by Earthquakes, Thunders, and Spectres to foretell the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and there were alſo intimations from Men concerning it, true enough in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, tho not ſufficient for the conviction of the Noble and very powerful <hi>Catiline:</hi> Wherefore <hi>Cicero</hi> deferring the Day of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, conven'd <hi>Catiline</hi> into the Senate, and there examin'd him of thoſe things that were reported; <hi>Catiline</hi> believing there were many in the Senate deſirous of Change, and to give a Specimen of himſelf to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators preſent, anſwered with a gentle Hypocriſie: <hi>What ill do I, ſays he, there being two Bodies, the one Lean and Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive with a Head, the other great and ſtrong without one, if I put a Head to that Body which wants one:</hi> Theſe things being enig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically ſpoken of the Senate and People, <hi>Cicero</hi> was the more afraid.</p>
               <p>Him, armed with Coat of Mail, the moſt eminent Citizens, and many of the Young Gentlemen conducted from his Houſe to the <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> where deſignedly throwing his upper Garment off from his Shoulders, he ſhewed his Armour under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, and diſcovered his danger to the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators, who being very much moved at it, gather'd round about him for his defence. But at length, <hi>Catiline</hi> was by a general Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage again put by, and <hi>Silanus</hi> and <hi>Murena</hi> choſen Conſuls.</p>

                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:36410:169"/>
Not long after this <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Soldiers were got together in a Body in <hi>Etruria,</hi> the Day appointed for the Deſign being near at hand: About midnight ſome of the principal and moſt powerful Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Marcus Craſſus, Marcus Marcellus,</hi> and <hi>Scipio Metellus</hi> went to <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Houſe, where knocking at the Gate, and calling up the Porter, they commanded him to awake <hi>Cicero,</hi> and tell him they were there. The Buſineſs was this; <hi>Craſſus</hi> his Porter after Supper, had delivered him Letters brought by an unknown Perſon: Some of them were directed to others, but one to <hi>Craſſus</hi> without a Name; this only <hi>Craſſus</hi> read, which inform'd him, that there was a great ſlaughter intended by <hi>Catiline,</hi> and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to leave the City: The others he did not open, but went with them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to <hi>Cicero,</hi> being affrighted at the danger, and to free himſelf of the ſuſpicion he lay under, for his familiarity with <hi>Catiline. Cicero</hi> therefore conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Matter, ſummon'd the Senate at break of day. The Letters he brought with him, and deliver'd them to thoſe to whom they were directed, commanding them to read them publickly; they all alike contain'd an account of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy.</p>

                  </note> a liſting of Men in <hi>Etruria;</hi> and that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> was ſaid to be by with a great force ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering about thoſe Cities, in expectation of ſome alteration in <hi>Rome.</hi> The Senate made a decree to put over all affairs to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, and that they taking them into their care, ſhould according to their diſcretion, order and preſerve the Common-wealth. This the Senate did not uſe to do often, but only in caſe of imminent danger: After <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> had receiv'd this power, he committed all Affairs abroad to <hi>Q. Metellus,</hi> but the manage of the City he kept in his own hands. Such a numerous attendance guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him every day he went abroad, that the greateſt part of the Market-place was fill'd with his train when he entred it. <hi>Catiline</hi> impatient of further delay, reſolved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to fly to <hi>Manlius</hi> his Camp; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Marcius</hi> and <hi>Cethegus</hi> to take their ſwords, and go early in the morning to <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>'s gates, as if only intending to ſalute him, and then to fall upon him and ſlay him. This a Noble Lady <hi>Fulvia</hi> coming by Night, diſcover'd to <hi>Cicero,</hi> bidding him beware of <hi>Cethegus</hi> and <hi>Marcius.</hi> They came by break of day, and being denied entrance, ſtormed and roared at the Gates, which render'd them more ſuſpicious. But <hi>Cicero</hi>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:36410:170"/>
going forth, ſummon'd the Senate into the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Stator</hi> ſeated on the top of the holy Street, which goeth up to the Capitol; where <hi>Catiline</hi> with others of his party alſo coming, as intending to make his defence, none of the Senators would ſit by him; but all of them left that Bench where he had placed himſelf, and when he began to ſpeak interrupted him with noiſe.</p>
               <p>At length <hi>Cicero</hi> ſtanding up command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to leave the City, for ſince one govern'd the Common-wealth with words, the other with arms, it was neceſſary there ſhould be a Wall betwixt them: <hi>Catiline</hi> therefore immediately left the Town, with three hundred armed Men, and taking to himſelf as a Magiſtrate, the rods, axes and other enſigns of Authority, he went to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> and having got together a Body of near twenty thouſand Men, with theſe he marched to the ſeveral Cities, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to perſwade or force them to revolt. So it being now come to open War, <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> was ſent forth to fight him, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of thoſe in the City which <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> had corrupted <hi>Cornelius Lentulus</hi> got together and encouraged.</p>
               <p>He had the Sirname <hi>Sura,</hi> a Man of a Noble Family, but a diſſolute liver, who for his debauchery was formerly thrown
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:36410:170"/>
out of the Senate, he was then the ſecond time Pretor, as the cuſtom was, when eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Perſons were reſtored to the Senatorian Honour: It is ſaid that he got the Sirname <hi>Sura</hi> upon this occaſion; being Queſtor in the time of <hi>Sylla,</hi> he had laviſhed away and conſumed a great quantity of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick moneys, at which <hi>Sylla</hi> being provok'd, call'd him to give an account in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, he appear'd with great inſolence and contempt, and telling him that he would make no account, held up the Calf of his leg, as boys uſe to do when they make a default at Ball, upon which he was Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Sura,</hi> for the <hi>Romans</hi> call the Calf of the leg <hi>Sura.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being at another time proſecuted at Law, and corrupting ſome of the Judges, he eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped only by two ſuffrages, but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd what he had given to one of them was a needleſs charge, becauſe one ſuffrage would have been ſufficient to have abſolved him.</p>
               <p>This Man, ſuch a one in his own nature, and incenſed by <hi>Catiline,</hi> the falſe Prophets and Magicians had alſo corrupted with vain hopes, inchanting him with fictitious Verſes and Oracles, and demonſtrating from the Sybilline Prophecies, that there were three <hi>Cornelius's</hi> deſign'd by Fate to be Monarchs of <hi>Rome;</hi> two of which, <hi>Cinna</hi> and <hi>Sylla</hi>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:36410:171"/>
had already fulfill'd the fatal decree, and that the Gods were now coming to offer the Monarchy to the third <hi>Cornelius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, and that therefore he ought by all means to accept it, and not loſe his opportunity by delay, as <hi>Catiline</hi> had done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lentulus</hi> therefore deſigned no mean or trivial matters, for he had reſolved to kill the whole Senate, and as many other Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens as he could, to fire the City, and ſpare no body but only <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Children, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſeize and keep them as pledges of his reconciliation with <hi>Pompey:</hi> For there was then a common and ſtrong report, that <hi>Pompey</hi> was returning from a great expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

at that time in a diſtreſſed condition, and very uneaſie under the <hi>Roman</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Theſe <hi>Lentulus</hi> and his party adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſeful inſtruments to move and ſeduce <hi>Gallia</hi> to revolt, admitted into the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and they gave them Letters to their own Magiſtrates, and Letters to <hi>Catiline,</hi> in thoſe they promiſed liberty, in theſe they exhorted <hi>Catiline</hi> to ſet all Slaves free, and to bring them along with him to <hi>Rome,</hi> they ſent with them to <hi>Catiline,</hi> one <hi>Titus,</hi> a Native of <hi>Croton</hi> who was to carry thoſe Letters to him.</p>
               <p>Theſe being the Counſels of inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men, and ſuch as converſed together with Wine and Women, <hi>Cicero</hi> purſued with induſtry, conſideration, ſobriety, and great prudence, having beſides ſeveral Emiſſaries abroad, who obſerved and traced with him all they did, he alſo conferr'd privately with, and confided in many, who were thought engaged in the Conſpiracy, he knew all the diſcourſes which paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and the ſtrangers; and lying in wait for them by Night, he took the <hi>Crotonian</hi> with his Letters, the <hi>Allobroges</hi> Embaſſadors being in private Conſult with him: By break of day he ſummoned the Senate into the Temple of <hi>Concord,</hi> where he read the Letters and examined the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverers.</p>

                  <hi>Cicero</hi> being got to his Friends houſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, a few only being preſent, fell to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate with himſelf, how he ſhould treat theſe Men; the ſevereſt puniſhment, and ſuch indeed as was fit for ſo great crimes he was afraid, and ſhie of executing, as well from the Clemency of his Nature as alſo leaſt he ſhould be thought to exerciſe his authority too inſolently, and to treat too rudely Men of the Nobleſt Birth, and moſt powerful friendſhips in the City, and yet if he ſhould uſe them more mildly, he had a dreadful proſpect of danger from them, for there was no likelyhood, if they ſuffered leſs than death, they would be reconciled to him, but rather adding new rage to their former wickedneſs, break forth into all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of inſolence, whilſt he himſelf ſhould gain thereby the repute of a cowardly and timorous Perſon, upon other accounts not thought over valiant by the Vulgar: Whilſt <hi>Cicero</hi> was doubting what courſe to take in theſe matters, a portentous accident hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened amongſt the Womens ſacrificing; for on the Altar where the fire ſeem'd wholly extinguiſhed, a great and bright flame iſſued forth from the Aſhes of the burnt Wood, at which others were affrighted; but the holy Virgins, call'd to <hi>Terentia, Cicero</hi>'s Wife, and bid her haſt to her Husband, and command him to execute what he had reſolved for the

good of his Country; for the Goddeſs had given great light to his Safety and Glory. <hi>Terentia</hi> therefore, as ſhe was otherwiſe in her own Nature neither pitiful nor timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but an ambitious Woman, (who, as <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf ſaith, would rather thruſt her ſelf into his publick Affairs, than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate her domeſtick to him) told him theſe things, and incenſed him againſt the Conſpirators; the ſame did alſo <hi>Quintus</hi> his Brother, and <hi>Publius Nigridius,</hi> one of his Companions in Philoſophy, whom he often made uſe of in his greateſt and moſt weighty Affairs of State.</p>
               <p>The next day, a debate ariſing in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate about the puniſhment of theſe Men, <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Syllanus</hi> being the firſt who was asked his Opinion, ſaid, It was fit they ſhould be all ſent to Priſon, and there ſuffer the utmoſt Penalty; to him all conſented in order till it came to <hi>Caius Caeſar,</hi> who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Dictator; he was then but a young Man, and had only gain'd the Beginnings of his future Riſe, having directed his Hopes and Policy that way, by which he afterwards changed the <hi>Roman</hi> affairs into a Monarchy; his guilt was unknown to others, yet to <hi>Cicero</hi> he had given many ſuſpicions, though no ſufficient proof to convict him; and there were ſome indeed that ſaid, tho' he was very near being diſcovered, yet

he had eſcaped him; but others were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that <hi>Cicero</hi> voluntarily overlookt and neglected the evidence againſt him for fear of his friends and power; for it was very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to every body, that theſe would be rather a means of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s eſcape, than <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>'s guilt an occaſion of their puniſhment: When therefore it came to <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s turn to give his opinion, he ſtood up <note n="*" place="margin">Senator ſtando ſententiam dixit.</note>, and declared that the Conſpirators ſhould not be put to death, but their Eſtates confiſcated, and their Perſons <note n="†" place="margin">Alia erat ſententia <hi>Caeſaris, viz.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juratos <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talinae</hi> in perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diam dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandos, non pro tempore, ſic teſtatur <hi>Criſp.

               <p>But all <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Friends judging <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Sentence moſt expedient for <hi>Cicero</hi> (becauſe he would incur the leſs blame, if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators were not put to death) choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the latter; ſo that <hi>Syllanus</hi> alſo chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his Mind, retracted his Opinion, and ſaid he had not declared for capital, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the utmoſt puniſhment, which to a <hi>Roman</hi> Senator is Impriſonment. <hi>Caeſar</hi> having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:36410:174"/>
his Sentence, <hi>Catulus Luctatius</hi> was the firſt who contradicted it; him <hi>Cato</hi> ſeconded, and in his Oration caſt ſuch a vehement ſuſpicion upon <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and ſo fill'd the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with anger and reſolution, that a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree was paſs'd for the execution of the Conſpirators; but <hi>Caeſar</hi> oppoſed the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcation of their Goods, not thinking it fit that thoſe who had rejected the mildeſt part of his Sentence, ſhould make uſe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt: Many inſiſting for it, he appeals to the <note n="*" place="margin">Penes Tribunos plebis erat morem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terponere Senatus conſulto.</note> Tribunes; but they would not be ruled by him, till <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf yielding, remitted that part of the Sentence about confiſcation.</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Cicero</hi> went out with the Senate to the Conſpirators; they were not all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one place; but the ſeveral Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors had them, ſome one, ſome another in cuſtody: And firſt he took <hi>Lentulus</hi> out of the Palace, and brought him by <hi>Via Sacra,</hi> through the middle of the Market-place, a Circle of the moſt eminent Citizens en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſing and guarding <hi>Cicero.</hi> The People affrighted at what was doing, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by in ſilence; eſpecially the young Men ſeem'd with fear and trembling, as if they were initiating in ſome ſacred Myſteries of Ariſtocratick Tyranny.</p>
               <p>Afterwards paſſing from the Market-place, and coming to the Gaol, he delivered <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus</hi> to the Officer, and commanded him

to execute him, and after him <hi>Cethegus,</hi> and ſo all the reſt in order he brought, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up to Execution.</p>
               <p>And when he ſaw many of the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators in the Market-place, ſtanding toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in companies, ignorant of what was done, but expecting Night, as if the Men were ſtill alive, and in a poſſibility of being reſcued, he call'd to them in a loud voice, and ſaid, <hi>They did live;</hi> for ſo the <hi>Romans</hi> to avoid harſh Language, expreſs thoſe that are dead: It was now Evening when he return'd from the Market-place to his own Houſe, the Citizens no longer attending him with ſilence, nor in order, but recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him as he paſſed, with acclamations and applauſes, ſaluted him, <hi>Saviour and Founder of his Country.</hi>

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:36410:175"/>
Commanders of that Age, for Riches, Spoils, and Power; yet to <hi>Cicero</hi> alone they ow'd the ſafety and ſecurity of all theſe, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering them from ſo great and eminent a danger; for though it might ſeem no wonderful thing to prevent the Deſign, and puniſh the Conſpirators, yet to defeat the greateſt of all Conſpiracies with ſo little damage, trouble and commotion, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry extraordinary; for many of thoſe who had run in to <hi>Catiline,</hi> as ſoon as they heard the fate of <hi>Lentulus</hi> and <hi>Cethegus,</hi> left and forſook him, and he himſelf with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Forces joyning Battel with <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> was deſtroy'd with his Army.</p>
               <p>And yet there were ſome who were very ready both to ſpeak and do ill to <hi>Cicero</hi> for theſe things, and they had for their Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſome of the Magiſtrates of the enſuing Year, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> one of the Praetors, and <hi>Metullus</hi> and <hi>Beſtia</hi> the Tribunes, theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon their Office ſome few days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Conſulate expired, would not permit him to make his Oration to the People; but throwing the Forms before the <hi>Roſtra,</hi> hinder'd his ſpeaking, commanding him, if he pleaſed, only to abjure his Office, and deſcend: <hi>Cicero</hi> upon this, moving, as going to abjure, and ſilence being made, he made his Oath not in the uſual, but a new and peculiar Form, <hi>viz.</hi> That he had
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:36410:175"/>
ſaved his Country and preſerved the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; the truth of which Oath all the People by Oath confirmed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caeſar</hi> and the Tribunes being the more exaſperated by theſe things, endeavour'd to create him further trouble, and therefore a Law was propoſed for the calling <hi>Pompey</hi> home with his Army, to ſuppreſs the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of <hi>Cicero;</hi> but it was a very lucky thing to <hi>Cicero,</hi> and the whole Common-wealth, that <hi>Cato</hi> was at that time one of the Tribunes, for he being of equal power with the reſt, and of greater eſteem, oppoſing their Deſigns, both eaſily defeated all other projects, and in an Oration to the People, ſo highly extolled <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Conſulate, that the greateſt Honours were decreed him, and he publickly declar'd the Father of his Country, which Title he ſeems <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Viz.</hi> The firſt time he had the honour of that Name given him before an Aſſembly of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for it was before given him in a full Senate by <hi>Q Catu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> as <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> himſelf teſtifies, <hi>Orat. cont.

               <p>At this time therefore his Authority was very great in the City; but he created him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf much envy, and offended very many, not by any evil Action, but becauſe he was always praiſing and magnifying himſelf: for neither Senate, nor Aſſembly of the People, nor Court of Judicature could meet, in which he was not heard to boaſt of <hi>Catiline</hi> and <hi>Lentulus;</hi> beſides, he ſo filled his Books
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:36410:176"/>
and Writings with his own <hi>Encomiums,</hi> that he rendred a ſtile in it ſelf moſt pleaſant and delightful, nauſeous, and irkſome to his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; this ungrateful humour, like a diſeaſe, always cleaving to him: Nevertheleſs, tho he was intemperately fond of his own praiſe, yet he was very free from envying others, and moſt liberally profuſe in commending both the Ancients and his contemporaries, as is to be underſtood by his Writings, and many of thoſe Sayings are ſtill recorded, as that concerning <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that he was a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of flowing Gold, of <hi>Plato</hi>'s dialogue, that if <hi>Jupiter</hi> were to ſpeak, he would diſcourſe as he did; <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> he was wont to call his peculiar delight, and being asked which of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> his Orations he liked beſt, he anſwered the longeſt.</p>
               <p>And yet ſome affected imitators of <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes,</hi> have complained of a ſaying, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>Cicero</hi> in an Epiſtle to ſome of his Friends, that <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> in ſome of his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations nodded; but they are forgetful of the many and ſingular <hi>Encomiums</hi> he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently gives him, and the Honour he did him, when he named the moſt elaborate of all his Orations, thoſe he wrote againſt <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony, Philippicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for the eminent Men of his own time, either for Eloquence or Philoſophy, there was not one of them which he did not

               </p>
               <p>In another he blames <hi>Gorgias</hi> the Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rician for ſeducing his Son to Luxury and Drinking, and therefore forbids him his Company, which latter with another to <hi>Pelops</hi> the <hi>Byzantine</hi> are the only two of his <hi>Greek</hi> Epiſtles, which ſeem to be written in Anger; in the firſt he juſtly reflects on <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gias,</hi> if he were what he was thought to be, a diſſolute and incorrigible Perſon; but in the other, he meanly expoſtulates and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains with <hi>Pelops,</hi> for neglecting to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him a Decree of certain Honours from the <hi>Byzantines;</hi> but theſe things are to be charged upon his Ambition, and the warmth and vehemency of his Speaking, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made him neglect <hi>Decorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Numatius,</hi> who had eſcaped judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by <hi>Cicero</hi>'s defence, proſecuted his Friend <hi>Sabinus,</hi> it is ſaid that <hi>Cicero</hi> fell ſo foul upon him in his Anger, that he told

To uſe this bitter rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery againſt Oppoſites and Antagoniſts in pleading ſeems allowable Rhetorick at a Bar, but to fall upon every body, only to move laughter, this created him great hatred: A few of which paſſages I ſhall relate. <hi>Marcus Aquilius,</hi> who had two Sons in Law in Exile, he call'd <note n="†" place="margin">It is a known ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draſtus</hi> King of <hi>Argos</hi> married his two Daughters to two Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives <hi>Tydeus</hi> and <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nices.</hi>

When <hi>Marcus Gellius,</hi> who was reputed the Son of a Slave, had read ſeveral Letters in the Senate; with a very ſhrill and loud voice, Wonder not, ſays <hi>Cicero,</hi> for this fellow is one of the Cryers: When <hi>Faustus Sylla</hi> the Son of <hi>Sylla</hi> the Dictator, who had during his Dictatorſhip by publick bills proſcribed and condemned ſeveral Citizens, had ſo far waſted his Eſtate, and got into debt, that he was forced to publiſh his bills of ſale, <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> told him, That he liked theſe bills much better than thoſe of his Father: By theſe things he became very odious to many.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Clodius</hi>'s Faction conſpired againſt him upon this occaſion: <hi>Clodius</hi> was one of a Noble Family in the flower of his youth, and of a bold and reſolute humour; he being in Love with <hi>Pompeia Caeſar</hi>'s Wife, got privately into his Houſe in the habit and dreſs of a Minſtrel, (for the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were then offering that Sacrifice in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s houſe, which is neither to be heard nor ſeen by Men) and there was no Man preſent; but <hi>Clodius,</hi> being a Youth and beardleſs, hoped to get to <hi>Pompeia</hi> among the Women, without being taken notice of, but entring that great houſe by Night he was loſt in the paſſages, where <hi>Aurelia</hi> one of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Mothers Women ſpying him, wandring up and down, inquir'd his name, thus being neceſſitated to ſpeak, he told her,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:36410:179"/>
he was ſeeking for one of <hi>Pompeia</hi>'s Maids, by name <hi>Aura,</hi> ſhe perceiving it not to be a Womans Voice ſhrieked out, and call'd in the Women, who preſently ſhutting up the Gates, and ſearching every place, at length found <hi>Clodius</hi> fled into the Chamber of that Maid with whom he came in: This matter being noiſed abroad, <hi>Caeſar</hi> put away his Wife <hi>Pompeia,</hi> and <hi>Clodius</hi> was <note n="*" place="margin">Not by <hi>Caeſar</hi> as the Latin Tranſlator by rendring it actively ſeems to imply, for he did not ſo much as teſtifie againſt him, but by the Tribune of the People, as our Author affirms in the life of <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
                  </note> proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for prophaning the holy Rites.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> was at this time his Friend, for he had been uſeful to him in the conſpiracy of <hi>Catiline,</hi> as one of his forwardeſt aſſiſtants and guard of his Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clodius</hi> putting the ſtreſs of his defence, upon this point, that he was not then at <hi>Rome,</hi> but a far off in the Country, <hi>Cicero</hi> teſtify'd that he came to his houſe that day, and diſcourſed with him of ſeveral matters, which thing was indeed true, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Cicero</hi> was thought to teſtifie it, not ſo much for the truths ſake, as to preſerve his quiet with <hi>Terentia</hi> his Wife, for ſhe had a ſpite at <hi>Clodius</hi> upon the account of his Siſter <hi>Clodia,</hi> who had a mind to marry <hi>Cicero,</hi> and manag'd the deſign by one <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> a Friend and intimate of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s in his greateſt affairs: And <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:36410:180"/>
viſiting and paying his Court to <hi>Clodia</hi> as a Neighbour, had given <hi>Terentia</hi> ground to ſuſpect him. And ſhe being a Woman of a ſowre humour, and having the aſcendant of <hi>Cicero,</hi> had provoked him to conſpire and teſtifie againſt <hi>Clodius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards many good and honeſt Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens did give evidence againſt him for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, forgeries, bribing the People, and deflowering of Women. <hi>Lucullus</hi> proved by his Maid-ſervants, that he had lain with his youngeſt Siſter, when ſhe was his Wife; and there was a publick Fame, that he did alſo converſe with his two other Siſters in the ſame way; <hi>Terentia,</hi> whom <hi>Martius Rex,</hi> and <hi>Clodia,</hi> whom <hi>Metellus Celer,</hi> had married; the latter of them was called <hi>Quadrantula,</hi> becauſe one of her Lovers had deceived her with a purſe of ſmall braſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney inſtead of Silver, the ſmalleſt braſs coyn being called a <hi>Quadrant.</hi> Upon this Siſters account, <hi>Clodius</hi> was principally defamed. Notwithſtanding all this, when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People appear'd in Tumults againſt the accuſers, and proſecutors of <hi>Clodius,</hi> the Judges were ſo affrighted, that a guard was placed about them for their defence; tho the names were confuſedly written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Tables, yet it was evident that the greateſt number did abſolve him; and it was ſaid there was bribery in the Caſe, and
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:36410:180"/>
therefore <hi>Catulus</hi> meeting the Judges, told them, You did well in requiring a guard for your ſafety, for fear your money ſhould have been taken from you; and when <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> upbraided <hi>Cicero,</hi> that the Judges did not believe his Teſtimony, Yes, ſaid he, five and twenty of them believ'd me, for ſo many of them have condemned you, but the other thirty did not believe you, for they did not abſolve you till they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd your Money.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Caeſar,</hi> tho cited did not give his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony againſt <hi>Clodius,</hi> nor pretended to be convinced of his Wife's Adultery, but that he had put her away, becauſe it was fit that <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Bed ſhould not be only free of the evil fact, but of the Fame too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clodius</hi> having eſcaped this danger, and got to be choſen one of the Tribunes of the People, immediately attack'd <hi>Cicero,</hi> heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up all matters, and inciting all Perſons againſt him, the common People he wheed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with popular laws; to each of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, he decreed large Provinces, to <hi>Piſo, Macedonia,</hi> and to <hi>Galinius, Syria:</hi> He mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd together a rabble of indigent Perſons to ſerve his deſign, and had always armed Slaves about him; of the three Men then in greateſt power, <hi>Craſſus</hi> was <hi>Cicero</hi>'s open Enemy, <hi>Pompey</hi> indifferently careſſed both, <hi>Caeſar</hi> was going with an Army into <hi>Gallia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:36410:181"/>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> applies himſelf to him, th none of his firm Friends, having had a ſuſpicion of him ever ſince the conſpiracy of <hi>Catiline;</hi> of him he deſires the Honour of being his Lieutenant General in that Province. <hi>Caeſar</hi> accepting him, <hi>Clodius</hi> perceived that <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> fled his tribunitian Authority, and therefore pretends to be inclinable to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement, lays the greateſt fault upon <hi>Terentia,</hi> makes always a favourable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, and treats him with kind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, as one who had neither hatred nor ill will towards him, and thus expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the matter moderately and friendly, he ſo freed <hi>Cicero</hi> of all his fears, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his Lieutenancy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and betook himſelf again to political affairs. At which <hi>Caeſar</hi> being exaſperated, he confirmed <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> againſt him, and wholly alienated <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> from him, he alſo himſelf declared in a publick aſſembly of the People, that he did not think <hi>Lentulus</hi> and <hi>Cethegus</hi> with their accomplices were well and legally put to death, without being brought to Tryal.</p>
               <p>And this indeed was the crime charged upon him, of which <hi>Cicero</hi> ſtanding accuſed and proſecuted, he changed his habit, and in a ſordid and untrimmed dreſs went about and ſupplicated the People, but <hi>Clodius</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways met him in every corner, having a pack of abuſive and daring fellows about
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:36410:181"/>
him, who with inſolence publickly derided his dreſs, and change of habit, and would often by throwing dirt and ſtones at him interrupt his ſupplications to the People. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho at firſt, almoſt the whole Equeſtrian or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der changed their habits with him, and no leſs than twenty thouſand young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men followed him untrimm'd, and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with him to the People on his behalf: Afterwards the Senate met, to paſs a decree, that the People ſhould change their habit as in time of publick ſorrow: But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls oppoſing it, and <hi>Clodius</hi> with armed Men beſetting the Senate-houſe, many of the Senators ran out, ſhrieking and tearing their Cloaths but this ſight moved neither ſhame nor pity in them, for <hi>Cicero</hi> muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fly or determine it by the Sword with <hi>Clodius.</hi> He intreated <hi>Pompey</hi> to aid him, who was on purpoſe gone out of the way, and reſided at his Country-houſe near <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and firſt he ſent his Son-in-Law <hi>Piſo,</hi> to intercede with him, but afterwards went himſelf, of which <hi>Pompey</hi> being informed, he durſt not ſtay to ſee him, for he had a great reverence for that Man, who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in ſo many quarrels for him, and had directed ſo much of his policy for his advantage, but being <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Son-in-Law, at his inſtance he ſet aſide all former kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs received from <hi>Cicero,</hi> and ſlipping out at
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:36410:182"/>
another door avoided his interceſſion: Thus being forſaken by <hi>Pompey,</hi> and left alone to himſelf, he fled to the Conſuls. <hi>Gabinius</hi> was always ſurly to him, but <hi>Piſo</hi> treated him more civilly, deſiring him to yield and give place for a while to the fury of <hi>Clodius,</hi> and to expect the change of times, and to be once more a Saviour to his Country from thoſe commotions and dangers which were raiſed upon his account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> receiving this anſwer, conſulted with his Friends: <hi>Lacullus</hi> adviſed him to ſtay, as being ſure to prevail at laſt, others to fly, becauſe the People would ſoon deſire him again, when they ſhould have enough of the rage and madneſs of <hi>Clodius.</hi> This laſt <hi>Cicero</hi> approv'd. But firſt he took the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Minerva,</hi> which had been long ſet up in his houſe, and worſhip'd with ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar devotion, and carrying it to the Capitol, there dedicated it with this inſcription: <hi>MINERVAE <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RBIS ROMAE PRAESIDI. To</hi> Minerva <hi>the Patroneſs of</hi> Rome. And receiving a ſafe convoy from his Friends, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of the night he left the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and went on foot through <hi>Lucania</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to reach <hi>Sicily.</hi> But as ſoon as it was publickly known that he was fled, <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> procured of the People a decree of Exile, and by bill interdicted him Fire and Water, prohibiting any within five hundred Miles
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:36410:182"/>
in <hi>Italy,</hi> to receive him into their Houſes. But all others, who reverenced <hi>Cicero,</hi> lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regarded the Decree, for ſhewing him all kind offices they attended him in his paſſage.</p>
               <p>But at <hi>Hipponium</hi> a City of <hi>Lucania,</hi> now call'd <hi>Vibo,</hi> one <hi>Vibius</hi> a <hi>Sicilian</hi> by birth, who amongſt many other effects of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s friendſhip, had been made Surveyor of the works when he was Conſul, would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed receive him into his houſe, yet ſent him word, he would appoint a place in the Country for his reception. <hi>C. Virginius</hi> the Pretor of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who had made uſe of <hi>Cicero</hi> in his greateſt neceſſities, wrote to him to forbear coming into <hi>Sicily.</hi> At theſe things <hi>Cicero</hi> being diſheartned went to <hi>Brundu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium,</hi> whence putting forth with a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wind, a contrary gale blowing from the Sea carried him back to <hi>Italy</hi> the next day; he put again to Sea, and having fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his Sail to <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> and putting on ſhore there, it is reported, that an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake and ſtorm at Sea happened at the ſame time, from whence the Southſayers conjectured his Exile would not be long; for thoſe things were Prognoſticks of Change. Although many viſited him with reſpect, and the Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> contended which ſhould honour him moſt, yet he continued diſheartned and diſconſolate, like an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:36410:183"/>
Lover, often caſting a look back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Italy,</hi> and indeed he was become ſo mean ſpirited, contracted, and dejected by his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, as none could have expected in a Man ſo thoroughly converſant in all ſorts of Learning as he was.</p>
               <p>And yet he often deſired his Friends not to call him Orator, but Philoſopher, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had made Philoſophy his buſineſs, but had only uſed Rhetorick as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Governing the Common-wealth, when there was neceſſity for it.</p>
               <p>But the deſire of Glory has great power in blotting the Tinctures of Philoſophy out of the Souls of Men, and of imprinting the paſſions of the Vulgar, by cuſtom and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the minds of thoſe that govern them; unleſs the politician be very careful ſo to ingage in publick affairs, as to intereſt himſelf in the affairs themſelves, but not in the paſſions that are conſequent to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clodius</hi> having thus driven away <hi>Cicero,</hi> fell to burning his Villa's, and afterwards his City houſe, and built in the place of it a Temple to <hi>Liberty,</hi> the reſt of his goods he expoſed to Sale by daily proclamation, but no body came to buy them.</p>
               <p>By theſe things he became formidable to the chiefeſt Citizens, and having got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Body of the Commonalty let looſe to all manner of inſolence and licentiouſneſs,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:36410:183"/>
he fell foul upon <hi>Pompey,</hi> inveighing againſt ſeveral things done by him in the Wars; for theſe matters <hi>Pompey</hi> falling under an ill Opinion with the People, began to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with himſelf for deſerting <hi>Cicero,</hi> and changing his mind, wholly ſet himſelf with his Friends to contrive his return, and when <hi>Clodius</hi> oppoſed it, the Senate made a Vote, that no publick Matter ſhould be decreed or acted, till <hi>Cicero</hi> was recalled: But when <hi>Lentulus</hi> was Conſul, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions grew ſo high upon this Matter, that the Tribunes were wounded in the Common Hall, and <hi>Quintus, Cicero</hi>'s Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was left as dead, and hid amongſt the ſlain; upon this the People began to change their Opinion, and <hi>Annius Milo</hi> one of their Tribunes, was the firſt who took confidence to hale <hi>Clodius</hi> by force unto Judgment. Many of the Common People, and of the Neighbouring Cities joyning with <hi>Pompey,</hi> he went with them, and drove <hi>Clodius</hi> out of the Common Hall, and Summon'd in the People to paſs their Vote; and it is ſaid the People never paſſed any Suffrage more una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly than this; the Senate alſo joyning with the People, ſent Letters of Thanks to thoſe Cities, which had received <hi>Cicero</hi> with reſpect in his Exile, and decreed, that his Houſe &amp; Villa's which <hi>Clodius</hi> had deſtroy'd ſhould be rebuilt at the publick charges.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:36410:184"/>
Thus <hi>Cicero</hi> returned Sixteen Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Exile, and the Cities were ſo glad, and the Men ſo zealous to meet him, that what <hi>Cicero</hi> boaſted of afterwards, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Italy</hi> had brought him on her Shoulders home to <hi>Rome,</hi> was rather leſs than the Truth: And <hi>Craſſus</hi> himſelf, who had been his enemy before his Exile, went then voluntarily to meet him, and was reconciled; to pleaſe his Son <hi>Publius,</hi> as he ſaid, who was <hi>Cicero</hi>'s moſt affectionate Friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> had not been long at <hi>Rome,</hi> but taking the opportunity of <hi>Clodius</hi> his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, he goes with a great company to the Capitol, and there tears and defaces the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunitian Tables, in which was recorded the Acts that were done in the time of <hi>Clodius: Clodius,</hi> calling him in queſtion for this, <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> anſwered that he being of the <hi>Patrician</hi> Order, had got the Office of Tribune a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Law, and therefore nothing was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid that was done by him: <hi>Cato</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed and oppoſed <hi>Cicero,</hi> not that he commended <hi>Clodius,</hi> but rather diſapproved his whole Adminiſtration of Affairs; yet he contended it was an irregular and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent courſe for the Senate to Vote the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of ſo many Decrees and Acts, in which alſo were the Memoirs of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Byzantium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:36410:184"/>
This occaſion'd a breach betwixt <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> which tho it came not to open enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet it made a more reſerv'd Friendſhip betwixt them: After this <hi>Milo</hi> kill'd <hi>Clodius,</hi> and being arraign'd for the Murther, he choſe <hi>Cicero</hi> for his Advocate. The Senate fearing leaſt the queſtioning of ſo eminent and high Spirited a Citizen as <hi>Milo,</hi> might diſturb the Peace of the City, committed the regulating of this, and ſuch other tryals to <hi>Pompey,</hi> to preſide for the ſecurity of the City, and of the Courts of Juſtice: <hi>Pompey</hi> therefore went in the Night, and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the outward part of the <hi>Forum</hi> with Soldiers. <hi>Milo</hi> fearing leaſt <hi>Cicero</hi> being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd by ſuch an unuſual ſight ſhould ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage his Cauſe ill; perſwaded him to come in his Chair into the <hi>Forum,</hi> and there to repoſe himſelf till the Judges were ſet, and the Court fill'd: For <hi>Cicero,</hi> as it ſeems was not only timorous in Arms, but began his pleadings alſo with fear, and ſcarce left trembling and ſhaking in ſome cauſes in the height and forms of his Oration: Being to defend <hi>Licinius Murena</hi> againſt the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Cato,</hi> and endeavouring to out-do <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> who had made his plea with great applauſe, he took ſo little reſt that Night, and was ſo diſorder'd with much Thought and overwatching, that he fell far ſhort of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt. Coming forth of his Chair to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:36410:185"/>
the Cauſe of <hi>Milo,</hi> and ſeeing <hi>Pompey</hi> placed above as in a Camp, and Arms ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning round about the <hi>Forum,</hi> he was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, that he could hardly begin his Speech for the trembling of his Body, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitance of his Tongue: But <hi>Milo</hi> appear'd at the tryal brisk and confident, diſdaining ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to let his hair grow, or to put on the mourning habit, which ſeems to be the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſe of his condemnation.</p>
               <p>And yet <hi>Cicero</hi> in theſe things was rather thought to be concern'd for his Friend than timorous. He was afterwards made one of thoſe Prieſts whom the <hi>Romans</hi> call <hi>Augurs,</hi> in the room of <hi>Craſſus</hi> the younger dead in <hi>Parthia,</hi> and having by lot obtain'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> he ſet ſail thither with twelve thouſand Foot, and two thouſand ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe; he had orders alſo to reduce <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia</hi> to the love and obedience of <hi>Arto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazanes</hi> their King, which ſettlement he effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with great acceptance without Arms; and perceiving the <hi>Cilicians,</hi> by the great loſs the <hi>Romans</hi> had ſuffer'd in <hi>Parthia,</hi> and the Commotions in <hi>Syria,</hi> grown inſolent; he reduced them into good Temper, by a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Government. He receiv'd no Preſents, tho ſent him by Kings: He remitted the Province the charge of Publick Suppers; but entertained daily at his own Houſe the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:36410:185"/>
better Quality,</hi> not Sumptuouſly, but Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. His Houſe had no Porter, nor was he ſeen in Bed by any Man; but early in the Morning ſtanding or walking before his Door, he courteouſly received thoſe that viſited him.</p>
               <p>He never commanded any to be beaten with Rods, nor to have their Garments rent: He never gave contumelious Language in his Anger, nor inflicted Puniſhment with Reproach. When he found any of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Monies purloin'd, he enriched the Cities with it; and thoſe who voluntarily made Reſtitution, without any further Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he preſerved entire in their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He made a little effort of War, and drave out the Thieves which infeſted the Mount <hi>Amanus,</hi> for which he was ſaluted by his Army <hi>Imperator.</hi> To <hi>Caetius</hi> the Orator, deſiring him to ſend him ſome Panthers from <hi>Cilicia,</hi> to be expoſed on the Theatre at <hi>Rome,</hi> with boaſting reflecting on his own Actions he wrote, that there were no Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> for they were all fled to <hi>Caria</hi> in Anger, that in ſo general a Peace they were left the only Subjects of his Arms.</p>
               <p>Leaving his Province for a time, he touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> but more willingly tarried at <hi>Athens,</hi> with a deſire of renewing his old Studies; where he viſited the moſt eminent Men of Learning, and ſaluted his Friends
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:36410:186"/>
and Familiars; and being deſervedly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd in <hi>Greece,</hi> he return'd to his own Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where Affairs were juſt as it were in a flame, breaking out into a Civil War. When the Senate would have decreed him a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, he told them, he had rather, ſo Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences were accommodated, follow the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Chariot of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> In private, he gave Advice to both; writing many things to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and entreating ſeveral of <hi>Pompey;</hi> molliſying, perſwading, and exhorting each of them: But when matters became incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> was approaching <hi>Rome, Pompey</hi> durſt not abide it, but with many honeſt Citizens left the City: <hi>Cicero</hi> avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the flight, and ſeem'd to adhere to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> tho it is very evident he was in his Thoughts much divided, and wavered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both; for thus he writes in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: <hi>To which ſide ſhould I turn?</hi> Pompey <hi>has an honeſt and ſpecious Pretence for War, but</hi> Caeſar <hi>has managed his Affairs better, and is more able to ſecure himſelf and his Friends; ſo that I know whom I ſhould flee, not whom I ſhould fly to.</hi> But when <hi>Treba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> one of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Friends, by Letter ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to him, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> thought it was his Intereſt to ſecure himſelf on his ſide, and to be partaker of his Hopes; but if his Age would not permit that, that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into <hi>Greece,</hi> and there abide and enjoy

his Quiet, remote from either Party. <hi>Cicero,</hi> wondring that <hi>Caeſar</hi> did not write himſelf, anſwer'd in Anger, that he would do nothing unworthy of thoſe things he had already done in Publick Affairs.</p>
               <p>After this manner therefore he writes in his Epiſtles. <hi>But as ſoon as</hi> Caeſar <hi>was marched into</hi> Spain, <hi>he immediately takes Shipping to go to</hi> Pompey; <hi>and he was very acceptable to all the reſt but</hi> Cato, <hi>who taking him privately, chid him for joyning himſelf to</hi> Pompey: <hi>As for himſelf, he ſaid, it had been very undecent, to have forſaken that part of the Commonwealth which he had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen from the beginning; but he might have been more uſeful to his Country and Friends, if remaining Neuter, he had attended and governed the Event, and not without Reaſon or Neceſſity have made himſelf an Enemy to</hi> Caeſar, <hi>and partner of ſo great Dangers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By theſe ſayings, <hi>Cicero</hi>'s mind was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed, but principally becauſe <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> made no great uſe of him; although indeed he was himſelf the cauſe of it, by profeſſing he repented his coming, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riding <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Preparations, by deſpiſing his Counſels, and not forbearing Jeers and pleaſant Reflections upon his Fellow-Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: For whileſt he walked ſowre and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy in the Camp, he was always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to move Laughter to others,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:36410:187"/>
who had as little reaſon to be merry, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And here it may not be amiſs to relate ſome few of thoſe Jeſts. To <hi>Demetrius,</hi> preferring one to a Command, who was no Soldier, and ſaying in his defence, that he was a Modeſt and Prudent Perſon; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, Why did not you keep him then for a Tutor for your Children? Some commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Theophanes</hi> the <hi>Lesbian,</hi> who was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Works in the Camp, for that he had excellently comforted the <hi>Rhodians</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the loſs of their Fleet: What an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary thing, ſaid he, it is to have a <hi>Greek</hi> Officer? When <hi>Caeſar</hi> had done many things ſucceſsfully, and in a manner beſieged <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey, Lentulus</hi> was ſaying, it was reported, that <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Friends were melancholy: You mean, ſays <hi>Cicero,</hi> they are wiſhing ill to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> To one <hi>Marcius,</hi> newly come from <hi>Italy,</hi> and telling them, that there was a ſtrong report at <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Pompey</hi> was block'd up; he ſaid, And therefore you ſail'd hither, that you might ſee it with your own Eyes, and believe it. To <hi>Nonius,</hi> encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging them after a Defeat to be of good hope, becauſe there were ſeven Eagles ſtill left in <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Camp: You encourage well, ſaid <hi>Cicero,</hi> if we were to fight with Jack-daws. <hi>Labienus</hi> demonſtrating from Divination, that <hi>Pompey</hi> was to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror: Yes, ſaid <hi>Cicero,</hi> and by truſting
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:36410:187"/>
to this Stratagem, we have already loſt our Camp.</p>
               <p>After the Battel of <hi>Pharſalia</hi> was over (at which he was not preſent, for want of Health) and <hi>Pompey</hi> was fled, <hi>Cato</hi> having conſiderable Forces, and a great Fleet at <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> would have had <hi>Cicero</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief, according to Law, and the Precedence of his Conſular Dignity. But <hi>Cicero</hi> refuſing the Command, and wholly avoiding to joyn with their Arms, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near being ſlain; young <hi>Pompey</hi> and his Friends calling him Traytor, and drawing their Swords upon him, had ſlain him, had not <hi>Cato</hi> interpoſed, and hardly reſcued and brought him out of the Camp.</p>
               <p>Afterwards arriving at <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> he tarried there ſome time, in expectation of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who linger'd becauſe of his Affairs in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Egypt;</hi> and when it was told him, that he was arrived at <hi>Tarentum,</hi> and was coming thence by Land to <hi>Brunduſium;</hi> he haſtened towards him, not altogether without Hope, and yet in ſome Fear of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king experiment of the temper of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and Conquerour in a publick Preſence. But there was no neceſſity for him, either to ſpeak or do any thing unworthy of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as ſoon as he ſaw him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good way before the reſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:36410:188"/>
to meet him, made his deſcent towards him, and ſaluted him; and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way, diſcourſed with him alone for many furlongs; and from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward continued to treat him with Honour and Reſpect: So that when <hi>Cicero</hi> wrote an Oration in praiſe of <hi>Cato, Caeſar</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt it, took occaſion of commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Eloquence and Life of <hi>Cicero,</hi> as moſt exactly reſembling that of <hi>Pericles</hi> and <hi>Theramenes. Cicero</hi>'s Oration was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Cato, Caeſar</hi>'s, <hi>Anti-Cato.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is reported, that when <hi>Quintus Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> was proſecuted for having been one in Arms againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken his Defence, <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaid to his F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>that after ſo long a time</hi> we ſhould hear <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeak? It being long ſince concluded, that <hi>Ligarius</hi> is an ill Man, and our Enemy.

At length, the Orator touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the <hi>Pharſalian</hi> Battel, he was ſo tranſported, that his Body trembled, and ſome of the Papers he held, dropt out of his hands; and thus being over-power'd, he acquitted <hi>Ligarius.</hi>

After this, the Common-wealth being changed into a Monarchy, <hi>Cicero</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelf from publick Affairs, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd his leiſure in inſtructing thoſe young Men that would, in Philoſophy; and by their Converſation and Acquaintance, being of the nobleſt and beſt Quality, he again got very great Power in the City. But his chief Buſineſs was to Compoſe and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate Philoſophical Dialogues; and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Logical and Phyſical Terms into the <hi>Roman</hi> Idiom: For he it was, as it is ſaid, who firſt or principally gave <hi>Latin</hi> names to <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:36410:189"/>
ſome new thing in praiſe of the Man and his Actions: As that which he ſaid of the Statues of <hi>Pompey;</hi> for theſe being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced and thrown down, <hi>Caeſar</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be reſtored, and they were ſo; and therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid, That <hi>Caeſar,</hi> by this Act of Humanity, had indeed ſet up <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Statues, but he had fixed and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed his own.</p>
               <p>He had a Deſign, as it is reported, of writing the Hiſtory of his Country, and of intermingling with it the Affairs of <hi>Greece,</hi> with the whole Body both of their true and fabulous Stories: But he was diverted by many publick and private Affairs, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther croſs Accidents; moſt of which ſeem to have befallen him by his own fault. For firſt of all, he put away his Wife <hi>Terentia,</hi> becauſe he had been neglected by her in the time of the War, and ſent away deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Neceſſaries for his Journey; neither did he find her kind when he return'd into <hi>Italy;</hi> for ſhe went not to <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> where he ſtaid a long time; nor would allow her young Daughter, who undertook ſo long a Journey, decent Attendance, or viatick Expences; beſides, ſhe left him a naked and empty Houſe, and yet had involv'd him in many and great Debts. Theſe were alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the moſt ſpecious Pretences of the Divorce. But for <hi>Terentia,</hi> who denied all
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:36410:189"/>
theſe things, <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf made an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Apology, by marrying a young Virgin not long after, for the love of her Beauty, as <hi>Terentia</hi> upbraided him; or as <hi>Tyro,</hi> his emancipated Slave hath written, for her Riches, to diſcharge his Debts; for the young Woman was very rich, and <hi>Cicero</hi> had the Cuſtody of her Eſtate, being left Guardian in Truſt; and being indebted many Myri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads, he was perſwaded by his Friends and Relations to marry this young Woman, notwithſtanding her Age, for the preſent ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his Creditors with her Money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antonius,</hi> mentioning this Marriage in his Anſwer to the <hi>Philippicks,</hi> reproaches him for putting away a Wiſe, with whom he had lived to old Age; withal wittily upbraiding <hi>Cicero</hi>'s ſitting at home as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active, and un-ſouldier-like. Not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Marriage; his Daughter died in Child-bed at <hi>Lentulus</hi>'s Houſe; for ſhe was married to him after the Death of <hi>Piſo,</hi> her former Husband. The Philoſophers from all parts came to comfort <hi>Cicero;</hi> for he took this Accident ſo grievouſly, that he put away his new-married Wife for ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to rejoyce at the death of <hi>Tullia.</hi> And thus ſtood <hi>Cicero</hi>'s domeſtick Affairs at this time.</p>
               <p>He had no Concern in the Conſpiracy againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> although <hi>Brutus</hi>'s moſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:36410:190"/>
Confident; and one who was as ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved at the preſent, and as deſirous of the former ſtate of Publick Affairs, as any other whatſoever: But the Conſpirators fear'd his Temper, as wanting Courage; and his old Age, in which the moſt daring Diſpoſitions are apt to be timorous.</p>
               <p>As ſoon therefore as the Fact was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> and the Friends of <hi>Caeſar</hi> were got together, ſo that there was fear the City would again be involved in a cruel War, <hi>Antonius</hi> being Conſul, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened the Senate, and diſcourſed ſome things briefly tending to Accommodation. <hi>Cicero</hi> interpoſing with many things agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Occaſion, perſwaded the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to imitate the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and decree Oblivion for all things that were done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Authority, and to beſtow Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces on <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius;</hi> but neither of theſe things took effect.</p>
               <p>For as ſoon as the Common People, of themſelves inclined to Pity, ſaw the dead Body of <hi>Caeſar</hi> born through the Market-place, and <hi>Antonius</hi> ſhewing his Garments fill'd with Blood, and pierced through on every ſide with Swords, enraged with Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they made a Search for the Murderers, and with Fire-brands in their hands ran to their Houſes, to burn them. But being fore-warned, they avoided this Danger, and
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:36410:190"/>
expecting many more, and greater attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, they left the City: Upon this <hi>Antonius</hi> was on a ſudden puffed up, and looking as if he would aſſume the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he became formidable to all; but moſt formidable to <hi>Cicero;</hi> for perceiving his Power again increaſing in the Common-wealth, and knowing him ſtudious of the Friendſhip of <hi>Brutus,</hi> his preſence was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uneaſie to him: Beſides, there had been ſome former Jealouſie betwixt them, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the unlikeneſs and difference of their Manners. <hi>Cicero</hi> fearing the event of theſe things, was inclined to go as Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant with <hi>Dolabella</hi> into <hi>Syria.</hi> But <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> and <hi>Panſa</hi> being deſigned Conſuls after <hi>Antonius,</hi> good Men, and Lovers of <hi>Cicero,</hi> intreated him not to leave them; underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to ſuppreſs <hi>Antonius,</hi> if he were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: But he neither wholly diſtruſting, nor truſting them, left <hi>Dolabella</hi> to go without him, promiſing <hi>Hircius</hi> that he would go and ſpend his <hi>Summer</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again when he entred upon his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. So he took his Voyage by himſelf; but lingring in his Paſſage, ſuch News came to him from <hi>Rome,</hi> as is uſual in ſuch caſes, that <hi>Antonius</hi> repented, and was ſtrangely changed; doing all things, and managing Publick Affairs at the Will of the Senate; and that there wanted nothing but his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:36410:191"/>
to reduce things to a happy Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therefore blaming himſelf for his great Cowardice, he return'd again to <hi>Rome,</hi> and was not deceived in his hopes at the beginning: For ſuch multitudes flock'd out to meet him, that the Complements and Civilities which were paid him at the Gates, and at his entrance into the City, took up almoſt one whole day's time.</p>
               <p>On the Morrow <hi>Antonius</hi> convened the Senate, and ſummoned <hi>Cicero</hi> thither; he came not, but kept his Bed, pretending to be ill of his Journey; but the true reaſon ſeem'd the fear of ſome Deſign againſt him, upon a ſuſpicion and intimation given him on his way to <hi>Rome.</hi> But <hi>Antonius</hi> took this Affront very hainouſly, and ſent Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, commanding them to bring him, or burn his Houſe; but many interceding, and ſupplicating for him, he was contented <note place="margin">Senatori abſenti mulcta in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicebatur, &amp; donec ſolveretur pignus ab eo capiebatur. <hi>Roſin. Antiq. pag.</hi> 1100.</note> only to accept Sureties for the payment of his Mulct for abſence.</p>
               <p>Ever after, when they met, they paſs'd one another with ſilence, and continued reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; till <hi>Caeſar</hi> the younger coming from <hi>Apollonia,</hi> entred upon the Inheritance of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and had a Controverſie with <hi>Antonius</hi> for two thouſand five hundred My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riads, which he detained of that Eſtate.

cruel Wars.</hi> It is ſaid, that <hi>Cicero,</hi> by this Viſion in his Dream, had framed the perfect Idea of the Youth, and preſerved it in his Mind, though he did not then know him.

And it prov'd to be this young <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who had for his Father <hi>Octavius,</hi> one of the moſt eminent Citizens; for his Mother, <hi>Actia,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and therefore <hi>Caeſar</hi> wanting Children of his own, made him by Teſtament Heir of his Eſtate and Family.</p>
               <p>From that time it is ſaid that <hi>Cicero</hi> very ſtudiouſly ſaluted the Youth whenſoever he met him, and he as kindly received the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility; and by Fortune he happened to be born when <hi>Cicero</hi> was Conſul. Theſe were the pretended Reaſons; but it was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Hatred of <hi>Antonius,</hi> and a Temper unable to reſiſt Honour, which faſtned him to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> with an opinion of uniting <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Power to his publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; for he had ſo inſinuated himſelf into the young Man, that he call'd him Father; at which thing <hi>Brutus</hi> was ſo highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, that in his Epiſtles to <hi>Atticus,</hi> he reflected on <hi>Cicero,</hi> ſaying, That it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:36410:192"/>
by his courting <hi>Caeſar,</hi> for fear of <hi>Antonius,</hi> he did not intend Liberty to his Country, but deſign'd a bountiful Maſter to himſelf. Notwithſtanding, <hi>Brutus</hi> took <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>'s Son, then ſtudying Philoſophy at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> gave him a Command, and by his Advice directed much of his Affairs. At this time <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Power was at the greateſt height in the City, and he did whatſoever he pleaſed; for he had ſuppreſſed and driven out <hi>Antonius,</hi> and ſent the two Conſuls, <hi>Hircius</hi> and <hi>Panſa,</hi> to follow him with an Army; but perſwaded the Senate to decree to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the <hi>Lictors</hi> and <hi>Praetorian</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, as fighting for his Country. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Antonius</hi> was defeated, and both the Conſuls ſlain, the Forces which came from the Battel, joyn'd themſelves with <hi>Caeſar.</hi> The Senate fearing the young Man, and his extraordinary Fortune, endeavoured by Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Gifts, to call off the Souldiers from him, and to leſſen his Power; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending there was no further need of Arms, now <hi>Antonius</hi> was put to flight.</p>
               <p>This giving <hi>Caeſar</hi> an Affright, he pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately ſends ſome Friends to intreat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade <hi>Cicero</hi> to procure the Conſular Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for them both together; and that he ſhould manage the Affairs as he pleaſed, have the Supreme Power, and govern the young Man, who was only deſirous of Name
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:36410:193"/>
and Glory. And <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf confeſſed, That in fear of Ruine, and in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſerted, he had ſeaſonably made uſe of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Ambition; perſwading him to ſtand with him, aſſiſt, and joyn his Votes for the Conſul-ſhip. And thus was old <hi>Cicero</hi> wheed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and gull'd by the young Man, to bring over his Suffrages, and engage the Senate on his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ide. His Friends ſoon blamed him for it; and within a little time after, he himſelf perceived, he was ruin'd by it, and had betray'd the Liberty of the People; for the young Man was ſo exalted, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Conſular Authority, that he bid <hi>Cicero</hi> Farewell; and reconciling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>Antonius</hi> and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> united his Power with theirs, and divided the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with them, as if it had been part of a common Eſtate. Thus united, they made a Schedule of above two hundred Perſons, who were deſigned to be put to Death: But the Proſcription of <hi>Cicero</hi> made the greateſt Contention in all their Debates: For <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> was inclinable to no Agreement, till he was firſt killed: To <hi>Antonius, Lepidus</hi> conſented; but <hi>Caeſar</hi> oppoſed them both. Their Meetings were held alone by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, remote from Company, for three days, near the City of <hi>Bononia:</hi> The Place where they met, was over againſt the Camp, encompaſſed with a River; <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as it is
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:36410:193"/>
ſaid, very earneſtly contended for <hi>Cicero</hi> the firſt days; but on the third day he yielded, and gave him up. The Terms of their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Conceſſions were theſe; That <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould deſert <hi>Cicero, Lepidus</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Paulus,</hi> and <hi>Antonius, Lucius Caeſar,</hi> his Uncle by his Mothers ſide: Thus did they fall by Anger and Fury from the ſence of Humanity, and demonſtrated, that no Beaſt is more ſavage than Man, when poſſeſſed with Power, anſwerable to his Rage. But whilſt theſe things were contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, <hi>Cicero</hi> was with his Brother at his Country-Houſe near <hi>Tuſculum;</hi> whence, hearing of the Proſcriptions, they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to paſs to <hi>Aſtura,</hi> a Villa of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s, near the Sea, and to take ſhipping from thence for <hi>Macedonia,</hi> to <hi>Brutus;</hi> for there was a Report, that he was ſtrong in thoſe Parts. They travelled together in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Litters, oppreſſed with Sorrow, and often ſtopping on the way, till their Litters came together, miſerably condoled one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. But <hi>Quintus</hi> was the moſt diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when he reflected on his want of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for his Journey; for, as he ſaid, he had brought nothing with him from home. And even <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf had but a ſlender Viatick Proviſion: It was adjudged therefore moſt expedient, that <hi>Cicero</hi> ſhould make what haſte he could to fly, and <hi>Quintus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn

               <p>But <hi>Quintus</hi> within a few days after, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd by his Servants to thoſe who came to ſearch for him, was ſlain, together with his young Son: But <hi>Cicero</hi> was carried to <hi>Aſtura;</hi> where, finding a Veſſel, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately went on board her, and ſailed as far as <hi>Circium</hi> with a proſperous Gale; but when the Pilots reſolv'd immediately to hoiſe Sail from thence, whether fearing the Sea, or not wholly diſtruſting the Faith of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he went on ſhoar, and paſſed by Land a hundred Furlongs, as if he were going for <hi>Rome;</hi> but wanting Reſolution, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his Mind, he again returned to Sea, and there ſpent his Night in Melancholy, and perplex'd Thoughts: ſometimes he reſolved to go into <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Houſe privately, and there kill himſelf upon the Altar of his Houſhold-Gods, to bring Divine Vengeance upon his Family; but the fear of Torture put him off this Courſe. And again, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving in his Mind other troubleſom and uncertain Reſolutions, at laſt he yielded himſelf to his Servants to be carried by Sea to <hi>Capua,</hi> where he had a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Houſe, and a pleaſant Retirement in the Spring, when the Eaſterly Winds blow ſweeteſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:36410:196"/>
There was in that place a Chappel of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo's</hi> not far from the Sea-ſide, from which a great flight of Crows ariſing with great noiſe, made towards <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Ship as it rowed to Land, and lighting on both ſides of the Croſs-Yard, ſome croaked, others peck'd the ends of the Sails. This was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon by all as an ill Omen; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Cicero</hi> went again on ſhoar, and entring his Houſe lay down upon his Bed, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf to Reſt: Many of the Crows ſate about the Windows, making a horrid noiſe; but one of them light upon the Bed where <hi>Cicero</hi> lay covered up, and with its Bill by little and little peck'd off the cloaths from his Face. His Servants ſeeing this, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themſelves, that they ſhould ſtay to be Spectators of their Maſter's Murder, and do nothing in his Defence, whilſt the brute Creatures did aſſiſt and take care of him in his undeſerved Affliction; and therefore, partly by entreaty, partly by Force, they took him up, and carried him in his Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But in the mean time the Aſſaſſinators were come with a Band of Souldiers, <hi>Heren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> the Centurion, and <hi>Popilius</hi> the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune (whom <hi>Cicero</hi> had formerly defended, when proſecuted for the Murder of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) finding the Doors ſhut, they brake them open, where <hi>Cicero</hi> not appearing, and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:36410:197"/>
thoſe within ſaying, they knew not where he was; it is reported, that a Youth, who had been educated by <hi>Cicero</hi> in the Liberal Arts and Sciences, an emancipated Slave of his Brother <hi>Quintus, Philologus</hi> by name, diſcover'd to the Tribune, that the Litter was carrying to the Sea through the cloſe and ſhady Walks: The Tribune, taking a few with him, ran to the place where he was to come out. As ſoon as <hi>Cicero</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Herennius</hi> running in the Walks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, he commanded his Servants there to ſet down the Litter; and ſtroaking his Chin, as he uſed to do, with his left hand, he looked ſtedfaſtly upon his Murderers. His Face was over-grown with Duſt and Hair, and worn away with Cares; ſo that the greateſt part of thoſe that ſtood by, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their Faces whilſt <hi>Herennius</hi> ſlew him; and thus was he murder'd, ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth his Neck out of the Litter, and being that very Year threeſcore and four years old. <hi>Herennius</hi> cut off his Head, and by <hi>Antonius</hi>'s Command, his Hands alſo, by which his <hi>Philippicks</hi> were written; for ſo <hi>Cicero</hi> ſtiled thoſe Orations he wrote againſt <hi>Antonius,</hi> and ſo they are called to this day. When theſe Members of <hi>Cicero</hi> were brought to <hi>Rome, Antonius</hi> was holding an Aſſembly for the choice of publick Officers; and when he heard it, and ſaw them, he cry'd out, <hi>Now let there be an end of all our Proſcriptions.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:36410:197"/>
He commanded his Head and Hands to be faſtned up over the <hi>Rostra</hi> of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; a horrid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And yet amidſt theſe Actions he did Juſtice in one thing, by delivering up <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lologus</hi> to <hi>Pomponia,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Quintus;</hi> who having got his Body into her Power, beſides other grievous puniſhments ſhe uſed, made him cut off his own fleſh by pieces, and boyl and eat it; for ſo ſome Writers have reported: But <hi>Tyro, Cicero</hi>'s emancipated Slave, has not ſo much as mentioned the Treachery of <hi>Philologus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some while after, as I have heard, <hi>Caeſar</hi> viſiting his Daughters Son, found him with a Book of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s in his Hand; the Boy for fear, endeavour'd to hide it under his Gown; which <hi>Caeſar</hi> perceiving, took it from him, and turning over a great part of the Book ſtanding, gave it him again, and ſaid, My Child, this was a learned Man, and a lover of his Country.</p>
               <p>But as ſoon as he had vanquiſhed <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> being then Conſul, he made <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Son his Collegue in that Office, in whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul-ſhip the Senate took down all the Statues of <hi>Antonius,</hi> and defaced all the other Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Honour; and decreed that none of that Family ſhould hereafter bear the

               </head>
               <p>THeſe are the moſt memorable of thoſe things delivered in Hiſtory of <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> which have come to our knowledge: But omitting an exact Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of their ſeveral Faculties in Speaking, yet thus much ſeems fit to be ſaid: That <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> to make himſelf a Maſter in Rhetorick, had applyed all the Knowledge he had natural, or acquired, wholly that way: That he far ſurpaſſed in force and ſtrength of Eloquence all his Contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, in Harangue and Pleading Cauſes; in Gravity and Magnificence of Style, all that were eminent of the Demonſtrative, and in Accuracy and Artifice, all of the Sophiſtick way. That <hi>Cicero</hi> was very Learned, and by diligent Study a general Scholar: That he hath indeed left behind him many Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Treatiſes of his own in the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick way: But yet it is very evident, that in all his Speeches and Pleadings he affected
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:36410:198"/>
to make Oſtentation of his Learning. And one may diſcover the different Temper of each of them in their Speeches: For <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi> his Oratory was without all embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment and jeſting, wholly compoſed to Gravity and Seriouſneſs; not ſmelling of the Lamp, as <hi>Pythias</hi> ſcoffingly ſaid, but of the Temperance, Thoughtfulneſs, Auſterity, and Melancholy of his Temper. But <hi>Cicero,</hi> by his jearing Humour, was often carried out to Scurrility; and by diſguiſing ſerious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments at the Bar with jeſts and laughter, for the advantage of his Client; he had no regard to what was decent: As that he ſaid in defence of <hi>Celius,</hi> That he had done no abſurd thing in ſuch plenty and delicacy, to indulge himſelf in Pleaſures; it being a kind of Madneſs, not to enjoy thoſe things we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, eſpecially ſince the moſt eminent Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers have aſſerted Pleaſure to be the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Good. It is reported, That when <hi>Cicero</hi> being Conſul, undertook the defence of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena</hi> againſt <hi>Cato</hi>'s Proſecution, that upon <hi>Cato</hi>'s account, he ſaid many things Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally againſt the <hi>Stoical</hi> Sect, for the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of their Paradoxes, as they called them; ſo that a loud laughter paſſing from the Croud to the Judges; <hi>Cato</hi> with a gentle ſmile ſaid to thoſe that ſate next him, <hi>O Gentlemen, what a ridiculous Conſul have we!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:36410:199"/>
And indeed <hi>Cicero</hi> was by a natural Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per very much diſpoſed to Mirth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in Jeering, and always appear'd with a ſmiling and ſerene Countenance. But <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes</hi> had conſtant Care and Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in his Look, which he ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver laid aſide; and therefore was accounted by his Enemies, as he himſelf confeſſeth, moroſe and ill-manner'd.</p>
               <p>And it is very evident cut of their ſeveral Writings, that this never touched upon his own Praiſes, but decently and without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, when there was need of it, and for ſome weightier end; but upon other occaſions modeſtly and ſparingly: But <hi>Cicero</hi>'s im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable boaſting of himſelf in his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, did proclaim in him an intemperate Thirſt after Glory: As when he cry'd out,
<q>
                     <l>Let Arms reſign their Honour to the Gown,</l>
                     <l>And to the Tongue the Victor throw his Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels down.</l>
                  </q>
But at laſt he did not only extol his own Deeds and Actions, but his Orations alſo, as well thoſe that were only ſpoken, as thoſe that were publiſhed; as if he were vying youthful Confidence with <hi>Iſocrates</hi> and <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximenes,</hi> the Sophiſters; not as if he were inſtructing and directing the <hi>Roman</hi> People, the hardy, warlike, and irreſiſtible <hi>Romans.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:36410:199"/>
It is neceſſary indeed for a States-man to be an able Speaker; but it is an ignoble thing for any Man to admire and relliſh the glory of his own Eloquence. And in this matter <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> had a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gravity and Magnificence of Mind; accounting his Talent in ſpeaking but a mean Acquirement, which needed great Candor in the Audience, and adjudging thoſe which are puffed up by ſuch Reflections, to be, as indeed they are, Servile and Mechanical. But the power of perſwading and governing the People did equally belong to both; ſo that thoſe who had Armies and Camps at Command, ſtood in need of their aſſiſtance; as <hi>Chares Diopithes</hi> and <hi>Leoſthenes</hi> of <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi>'s, <hi>Pompey</hi> and young <hi>Caeſar</hi> of <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>'s, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> acknowledges in his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries to <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Mecaenas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what is thought and commonly ſaid moſt to demonſtrate and try the Tempers of Men, <hi>viz.</hi> Authority and Place, by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving every Paſſion, and diſcovering every frailty, never happened to <hi>Demoſthenes;</hi> nor had he the occaſion of giving ſuch Proof of himſelf, having never obtained any eminent Office, nor led any of thoſe Armies into the Field againſt <hi>Philip,</hi> which he rais'd by his Eloquence.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Cicero</hi> was ſent Quaeſtor into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and Proconſul into <hi>Cilicia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi>
                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:36410:200"/>
at a time when Avarice was at the height, and the Commanders and Governours who were employ'd abroad, thinking it a mean thing to ſteal, ſet themſelves to ſeize by open force; ſo that it ſeem'd no heinous matter to take Bribes: But he that did it moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, was in good Eſteem; and yet then gave great demonſtration of his contempt of Riches, and as great of his Humanity and good Nature.</p>
               <p>And at <hi>Rome</hi> alſo, when he was created Conſul in Name, but indeed received Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and Dictatorian Authority againſt <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiline</hi> and his Conſpirators, he atteſted the truth of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Prediction, That then the miſeries of States would be at an end, when by a happy Fortune the Supream Power with Wiſdom and Juſtice ſhould meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame Subject.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid to the Reproach of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> that his Eloquence was mercenary; that he privately made Orations for <hi>Phormio</hi> and <hi>Apollodorus,</hi> though Adverſaries in the ſame Cauſe; That he was charged with Monies received from the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for Bribes from <hi>Harpalus:</hi> And ſhould we grant all thoſe that have written theſe things againſt him (which are not a few) to have falſified; yet it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but that <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> wanted Courage to look off of thoſe Preſents, which in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

               <p>But that <hi>Cicero</hi> did refuſe from the <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> when he was Quaeſtor, from the King of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> when he was Proconſul, and from his Friends at <hi>Rome,</hi> when he was in Exile, many Preſents, though urged to receive them, has been ſaid already. Moreover, <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> his Baniſhment was infamous, upon Conviction for Bribery; <hi>Cicero</hi>'s very Honourable, for ridding his Country of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Fellows; and therefore his Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not at all regarded: But for this Man's ſake the Senate changed their Habit, and put on Mourning, and would not be perſwaded to make any Act before <hi>Cicero</hi>'s return were decreed. And yet <hi>Cicero</hi> paſſed his Exile, ſitting down idly in <hi>Macedonia:</hi> But the very Exile of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> made up a great part of the Services he did for his Country; for whilſt he travelled the Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> he every where, as we have ſaid,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:36410:201"/>
aſſiſted the <hi>Grecians,</hi> driving out the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian</hi> Legats, and approving himſelf a much better Citizen than <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> and <hi>Alcibiades</hi> did in the like Fortune. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his return, he again apply'd himſelf to the ſame Publick Services, and continued oppoſing <hi>Antipater</hi> and the <hi>Macedonians.</hi> But <hi>Lesbius</hi> reproacheth <hi>Cicero</hi> in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, for ſitting ſilent, when <hi>Caeſar,</hi> a beard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Youth, asked leave to put in for the Conſulſhip againſt Law: And <hi>Brutus,</hi> in his Epiſtles, charges him with cheriſhing a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more heavy Tyranny, than that they had removed.</p>
               <p>But above all, none but muſt pity <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Death; for an Old Man to be carried up and down by the kindneſs of his Servants, to flie and hide himſelf from that Death, which was ſo near at hand, and yet at laſt to be Murdered.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> tho he ſeem'd at firſt a little to ſupplicate, yet his preparing, and keeping the Poiſon by him, was admirable; but more admirable the uſing of it: For when the God afforded him not a Sanctuary, by flying to a greater Altar, he got away from Arms and Guards, and laughed at the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of <hi>Antipater.</hi>

<pb n="389" facs="tcp:36410:204"/>
that he was extreamly like to <hi>Periander</hi> the Son of <hi>Cypſelus,</hi> as it is ſaid that <hi>Oron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes the Perſean</hi> did much reſemble <hi>Alcmaeon</hi> the Son of <hi>Amphiaraus;</hi> and a Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian youth, <hi>Hector;</hi> whom <hi>Myrſilus</hi> relates to have been trode to pieces by the crowd of thoſe that came to ſee him upon that report; this <hi>Nicocles</hi> governed four Months, in which after he had exceedingly plagued the City, he was very near loſing it by a ſtratagem of the <hi>Aetolians.</hi> By this time <hi>Aratus,</hi> being grown a youth, was in much eſteem, both for his noble birth and parts, which ſhewed themſelves neither ſmall nor unactive, but beyond his age tempered with firmneſs of reſolution, for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the <hi>Exiles</hi> had their eyes moſt upon him, nor did <hi>Nicocles</hi> leſs obſerve his moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but ſecretly ſpyed and watched him, not out of apprehenſion of any conſiderable or dangerous attempt, but ſuſpecting he held correſpondence with the Kings, who were his Fathers friends and acquaintance. And indeed <hi>Aratus</hi> firſt attempted this way: but finding that <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who had promiſed fair, neglected him and delay'd the time, and that his hopes from <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> were too remote, he determined to cut off the Tyrant by himſelf; and firſt he broke his mind to <hi>Ariſtomachus</hi> and <hi>Ecdelus,</hi> the one an <hi>Exile</hi> of <hi>Sicyon,</hi> the other namely

               <hi>Ecdelus</hi> an <hi>Arcadean</hi> of <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, and a daring man, having been the familiar friend of <hi>Arceſilaus</hi> the <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick</hi> at <hi>Athens.</hi> Theſe readily conſenting, he communicated himſelf to the other <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iles,</hi> whereof ſome few being aſhamed to ſeem to deſpair of ſucceſs ingag'd in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, but moſt of them indeavour'd to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him from his purpoſe as one that for want of experience was too raſh and daring.</p>
            <p>Now whileſt he was conſulting to ſeize upon ſome Poſt in <hi>Sicyonia,</hi> from whence he might make war upon the <hi>Tyrant,</hi> there came to <hi>Argos</hi> a certain <hi>Sicyonian</hi> newly eſcap'd out of Priſon, Brother to <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> one of the <hi>Exiles,</hi> who being by him preſented to <hi>Aratus,</hi> he informed him, that <note place="margin">

               <hi>Polygnotus,</hi> with orders to ſtay there; <hi>Capheſias</hi> alſo was diſpatched away before-hand lightly armed with four others, who were, as ſoon as it was dark, to come to the Gardiner's houſe, pretending to be Travellors, and lodging there to ſhut up him and his Dogs, for there was no other way to the City; and for the Ladders, they being made to take in pieces, were put into Cheſts, and ſent before hidden upon Waggons, in the mean time ſome of <hi>Nicocles</hi> his ſpyes appearing in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos,</hi>
               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:36410:206"/>
and being ſaid to go privately about watching <hi>Aratus,</hi> he came by day-break in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Market-place ſhewing himſelf open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſing with his friends; then being anointed in the place for Exerciſes, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with him thence ſome of thoſe young men that uſed to drink and ſpend their time with him, he went home, and preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeveral of his ſervants were ſeen about the Market-place, ſome carrying Garlands, ſome buying Flambeaus, ſome ſpeaking to the Women that uſed to ſing and play at Banquets; which things the Spies obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving were deceiv'd, and ſaid laughing to one another, <hi>That certainly nothing was more timerous than a Tyrant,</hi> if <hi>Nicocles being maſter of ſo great a City and ſo great power, ſtood in fear of a youth, that ſpent what he had to ſubſiſt upon in his baniſhment in pleaſures and day debauches,</hi> and being thus cheated returned home.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Aratus</hi> immediately after dinner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting and coming to his Souldiers at <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygnotus</hi>'s Tower, led them to <hi>Nemea;</hi> where <note place="margin">His mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon.</hi>
               </note> he diſcovered to them his true deſign, and having made them many large promiſes and ſpeeches, he marched towards the City, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for the word <hi>Propitious Apollo,</hi> proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning his march to the motion of the Moon, ſo as to have the benefit of her Light upon the way and to be at the Gardiners houſe
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:36410:206"/>
which was cloſe to the wall, juſt as ſhe was ſet. Here <hi>Capheſias</hi> came to him, who could not catch the dogs which run away from him; but had made ſure of the Gardiner. Upon which moſt of the Company being out of heart, and deſiring to retreat, <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> incourag'd them to go on, promiſing them to retire in caſe the Dogs were too troubleſome, and at the ſame time ſending before thoſe that carri'd the ladders, conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Ecdelus</hi> and <hi>Mnaſitheus,</hi> he follow'd them himſelf leaſurly, the Dogs already bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very loud, and baying at <hi>Ecdelus</hi> and his Companions; however they got to the wall and reared the ladders with all ſafety. But as the foremoſt men were mounting them, the Captain of the Watch that was to be reliev'd by the morning Guard, paſs'd by that way at the ſound of a little bell, with many torches, and a great deal of noiſe, hearing which they clapt themſelves cloſe to the ladders, and ſo were un-obſerv'd, but the other Watch coming to meet this, they were in extreme danger of being diſcover'd. But having eſcap'd that alſo, immediately <hi>Mnaſitheus,</hi> and <hi>Ecdelus</hi> got upon the wall, and poſſeſſing themſelves of the paſſages each way, they ſent away <hi>Technon</hi> to <hi>Aratus</hi> deſiring him to make all the haſt he could. Now there was no great diſtance from the Garden to the wall and a certain tower in
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:36410:207"/>
which a great Grey-hound was kept. Yet he heard them not as they marched forward, whether being naturally drowſy, or elſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwearyed the day before, but the Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Currs awaking him, he firſt began to grumble, and then as they paſs'd by to bark out aloud, and the barking was now ſo great, that a <hi>Sentinel</hi> that was further off called out to the Dogkeeper, to know why the Dog kept ſuch a barking, and whether any thing had happened. Who anſwer'd that it was nothing, but only that his Dog fell a barking at the lights of the watch, and the noiſe of the Bell. This reply much incouraged <hi>Aratus</hi>'s Soldiers, who thought the Dogkeeper was privy to their deſign, and therefore conceal'd what was paſſing; and that many others in the City were of the conſpiracy. But when they came to ſcale the wall, the attempt then appear'd both to require time, and to be full of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for the ladders ſhook and bent extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they mounted them not leiſurely, and one by one, and time preſſed, for the Cocks began to crow, and the Country people that us'd to bring things to the Market were upon coming to the Town. Wherefore <hi>Aratus</hi> haſted to get up himſelf, forty on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the company being already upon the wall, and ſtaying but for a few more of thoſe that were below, he made ſtrait to
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:36410:207"/>
the <hi>Tyrant's</hi> Palace, and the main guard where his mercenary Soldiers kept watch, and coming ſuddenly upon them, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them priſoners without killing any one of them, he immediately ſent to all his Friends to deſire them to come to him, which they did from all Quarters: By this time the day began to break, and the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater</hi> was full of the multitude that were held in ſuſpence, by uncertain reports, and knew nothing diſtinctly of what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, untill a <hi>Publick Cryer</hi> going before him proclaim'd that <hi>Aratus</hi> the Son of <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> invited the Citizens to recover their liberty, and then believing that what they ſo long looked for, was now come to paſs, they preſs'd in throngs to the <hi>Tyrants</hi> gates to ſet them on fire, and ſo great was the flame of the houſe, now all on fire, that it was ſeen as far as <hi>Corinth;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Delivers the City without bloodſhed.</note> wondering what the matter ſhould be, were upon the point to have come to their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Now <hi>Nicocles</hi> fled away ſecretly out of the City by means of certain under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground paſſages, and the Soldiers helping the <hi>Sicyonians</hi> to quench the fire plunder'd the <hi>Palace.</hi> This <hi>Aratus</hi> hindred not; but divided alſo the reſt of the riches of the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants</hi> amongſt the Citizens. In this exploit not one of thoſe ingag'd in it, was ſlain, nor any of the contrary party, fortune ſo
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:36410:208"/>
ordering the action as to be clear and free from civil bloodſhed. Of the <hi>Exiles</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored fourſcore expell'd by <hi>Nicocles,</hi> and no leſs than five hundred of thoſe that were driven out by former <hi>Tyrants,</hi> and had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured a long and near fifty years baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe returning moſt of them very poor were impatient to enter upon their former poſſeſſions, and retiring to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Country Farms and Houſes, gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of great perplexity to <hi>Aratus,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd that the City without was envy'd for its liberty, and aimed at by <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and within was full of diſorder and ſedition; wherefore as things ſtood, he thought it beſt to aſſociate it to the <hi>Achaean Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">And aeſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates it to the <hi>Achae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
               </note> for being <hi>Dorians</hi> they willingly took upon them the name and polity of the <hi>Achae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who at that time had neither great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority nor power. For the moſt of them liv'd in ſmall Towns, and their Territory was neither large nor fruitful, and the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sea was without Ports, entring the Land for the moſt part in rockey Creeks. And yet theſe made it evidently appear that the Grecian force was invincible whenſoever it met with order and concord within its ſelf, and a prudent General; for though they were the moſt inconſiderable part of the antient Grecian power, not equalling the ſtrength of an ordinary City, yet by pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:36410:208"/>
and unanimity, and becauſe they knew how not to envy and malign but to obey and follow him amongſt them, that was moſt eminent for vertue, they not only preſerv'd their own liberty in the midſt of ſo great and powerful Cities and Dominions, but deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd from ſlavery the moſt part of <hi>Greece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Aratus</hi> he was in his behaviour an exact Common-wealths-man, generous, more <note place="margin">The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ractar of <hi>Aratus.</hi>
               </note> intent upon the publick than his private concerns, a bitter hater of <hi>Tyrants,</hi> making the common good the meaſure of his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and enmities, ſo that he ſeems not to to have been ſo true a Friend, as a courteous and gentle Enemy, ſuiting himſelf to all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities for the ſake of the Common-wealth. So that the conſent of Nations and Community of Cities, the <hi>Senate,</hi> the <hi>Theater</hi> do with one voice proclaim that <hi>Aratus</hi> was a lover of nothing but noble actions. He was indeed backward and diffident to make uſe of war and open force; but for ſecret attempts and ſuddain ſurprizing of Cities and Tyrants moſt politick and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous. Wherefore though he affected many things beyond hope which he undertook, yet he ſeems to have left no leſs unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, though feaſible enough, for want of aſſurance; <q>for it ſhould ſeem that as the ſight of certain beaſts is ſtrong in the night but dim by day, the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:36410:209"/>
of the humors of their eyes not bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mixture of the light:</q> ſo the geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us of ſome men though eaſily daunted as to things to be attempted in the ſight of the Sun, is yet very daring in ſecret and covert enterprizes, which inequality is occaſioned in noble minds for want of <hi>Phyloſophy,</hi> whence is produced a certain wild and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated vertue without true knowledge, as may be made out by many examples.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aratus</hi> therefore having aſſociated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his City to the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> ſerving in the Cavalry was much belov'd by his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers for his exact obedience, for though he had made ſo large an addition to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,</hi> as that of his own credit, and the power of his Country, yet he was as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be commanded by any of the <hi>Achae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Generals, whether of <hi>Dyma</hi> or <hi>Trita,</hi> or though of never ſo mean a City, as the moſt common Soldier. Having alſo a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of five and twenty Talents ſent him from the King he took them, but gave them all to his poor Fellow Citizens, as well for other uſes as the redeeming of Captives. But the <hi>Exiles</hi> being by no means to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd, <note place="margin">He ſails into <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
               </note> diſturbing continually thoſe that were in poſſeſſion of their Eſtates, the City was in great danger of falling into civil diſſenſions. Having therefore no hope left him, but from the kindneſs of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> he
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:36410:209"/>
reſolved to ſail thither, and to beg ſo much mony of the King as would ſatisfie all parties. So he ſet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ail from <hi>Methone</hi> above the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of <hi>Malea,</hi> as deſigning to paſs through the channel there. But the Pilot not being able to keep the Veſſel up againſt the ſtrong Wind and high Seas, he was turned from his courſe, and with much ado got to <hi>Adria,</hi> an Enemy's Town; for it was poſſeſs'd by <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who had a Garriſon there. To a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void which he immediately landed, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Ship went up into the Country a good way from the Sea, having along with him only one Friend called <hi>Timanthes,</hi> ſo hiding themſelves in a certain woody place they had but an ill nights reſt of it. Not long after the Governour came, and inquiring for <hi>Aratus</hi> was deceiv'd by his Servants, being inſtructed to ſay, that he was fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iſland of <hi>Eubaea;</hi> wherefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Ship, the Cargo, and Servants to be Lawful prize, and detain'd them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. As for <hi>Aratus</hi> he being after ſome days reduced to extrèmity, by good fortune a Roman Ship happen'd to put in juſt in the place where he continued ſometimes peeping out to diſcover the coaſt, ſometimes keeping cloſe; ſhe was bound for <hi>Syria.</hi> And going abroad he agreed with the Maſter to land him in <hi>Caria:</hi> In which voyage he met with no leſs danger than before. From <hi>Caria,</hi>
               <pb n="400" facs="tcp:36410:210"/>
being after much time arrived in <hi>Egypt,</hi> he immediately went to <hi>the King,</hi> who had a great kindneſs for him by reaſon of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents he uſed to ſend him of drawings and pictures out of <hi>Greece.</hi> In which <hi>Aratus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving very good judgment did uſually preſent him with ſome of the moſt curious and beſt done, eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Pamphilus</hi> and <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> making collections of them at any rate.</p>

It was an extraordinary piece, and therefore <hi>Aratus</hi> was inclinable to ſpare it for the workmanſhip, but then inſtigated by the hatred he bore the <hi>Tyrants,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it to be taken down; But here, as it is reported, <hi>Neacles</hi> the Painter, one
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:36410:210"/>
of <hi>Aratus</hi>'s Friends intreated him with teares in his eyes to ſpare it, and finding that he could not prevaile, ſaid to him, that <hi>War was to be waged with the Tyrants themſelves, not with their pictures.

               <hi>Aratus</hi> was in favour with the King, who after he was more fully acquainted with him loved him ſo much the more, and gave him for the relief of his City one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Talents: fourty whereof he immediately carry'd away with him, when he ſailed to <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> but the reſt the King divided into ſeveral gifts, and ſent them to him afterwards by parcels.

Traitors and Houſe-breakers if taken, are alike puniſhed with death: <hi>Erginus</hi> ſmiling upon him promiſed to breake the thing to <hi>Diocles</hi> (for he did not ſo fully truſt his other Brothers) and returning within a few days, he bargain'd to conduct <hi>Aratus</hi> to that part of the wall, where it was no more than fifteen foot high, and to do what elſe ſhould be neceſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> together with his Brother <hi>Diocles.

            <p>Now this exploit, though dangerous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in its ſelf, was made much more ſo by an error happ'ning through miſtake in the very beginning. For <hi>Technon</hi> one of <note place="margin">Technon Servant to <hi>Aratus</hi> his miſtake.</note>

Then the reſt of them ſitting down put off their ſhoe's (both becauſe they make leſs noiſe and alſo climb ſurer, that go up ladders bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed) but <hi>Erginus</hi> taking with him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven young men habited like Travellers, got unobſerved to the gate, and kill'd the <hi>Sentry</hi> with the other Guards, and at the ſame time, the Ladders were clapp'd to the walls, and <hi>Aratus</hi> having in great haſt got up a hundred men, he commanded the reſt to follow as they could, and immediately drawing up his Ladders after him, he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Surpriſes the City.</note> through the City with his hundred men towards the Caſtle, being overjoy'd that he was undiſcover'd, not doubting of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. When immediately four of the Watch were ſeen coming towards them with a light. But they diſcover'd them not, becauſe they were in the ſhade; wherefore covering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a while near ſome walls and old ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines, they lay'd in wait for them, and three of them they kill'd. But the fourth being
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:36410:216"/>
wounded in the head with a ſword, fled, crying out that Enemies were got into the City, and immediately the Trumpets ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and all the City was in an uproar at what had happen'd, and the ſtreets were full of People running up and down, and many lights were hung out, both below in the Town, and above in the Caſtle, and a confuſed noiſe was to be heard in all parts. In the mean time <hi>Aratus</hi> laboured to get up the Rocks, at firſt ſlowly, and with much difficulty, having loſt the Path, which lay deep, and was overſhaddow'd with Craggs, leading to the wall with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny windings and turnings; but the Moon immediately and by miracle, as is ſaid, diſperſing the Clouds, gave light to the moſt difficult part of the way, till he got to that part of the wall he deſired, and there ſhe overſhadow'd, and hid him, the Clouds coming together again. Now thoſe Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which <hi>Aratus</hi> had left without the gate near <hi>Juno's Temple,</hi> to the number of three hundred, entring the Town full of tumult and lights, and miſſing the way by which the former had gone, finding no track of them, were very much affraid, ſhrowding themſelves under the ſhady ſide of a Rock, and there they ſtood, being in great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and perplexity. For now <hi>Aratus</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers being ingag'd with thoſe of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:36410:216"/>
a warlike cry deſcended, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd noiſe was heard ecchoing on all hands, by reaſon of the refraction from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and therefore uncertain whence it firſt proceeded. Being thus in doubt which way to turn themſelves, <hi>Archelaus</hi> Captain of <hi>Antigonus</hi>'s men, having a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Soldiers with him, made up towards the Caſtle with great ſhouts and the noiſe of Trumpets to fall upon <hi>Aratus</hi>'s People, and paſs'd by the three hundred, who as if they had roſe out of an ambuſh imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately charged him, killing the firſt they encountred, and ſo affrighted the reſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Archelaus,</hi> that they put them to flight and purſued them, till they had quite broke and diſperſed them about the City. No ſooner were theſe defeated, but <hi>Erginus</hi> came to them, from thoſe that were fighting above, to acquaint them, that <hi>Aratus</hi> was ingaged with the Enemy, that defended themſelves very ſtoutly, and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Stormes the</hi> Acro-Corinth,</note> fought bravely for the wall, ſo that he ſtood in need of ſpeedy help. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſir'd him to lead them on without delay, and marching up, they by their ſhouts made their Friends underſtand who they were, and incourag'd them; now the full Moon, ſhining on their harneſs, made them at a diſtance appear more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to the Enemy than they were. And
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:36410:217"/>
the Eccho of the night multiply'd their ſhouts; in ſhort falling on with the reſt they made the Enemy give way, and by break of day were Maſters of the Caſtle and Garriſon, ſo that the riſing Sun gave <note place="margin">and takes it.</note> luſtre to their Exploit. By this time the reſt of the Army came up to <hi>Aratus</hi> from <hi>Sicyon,</hi> the <hi>Corinthians</hi> joyfully receiving them at their Gates, helping them to ſecure the reſt of the Kings party; and now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put all things into a ſafe poſture, he came down from the Caſtle to the <hi>Theater,</hi> an infinite number of People crowding thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſee him, and to hear what he would ſay to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Wherefore draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the <hi>Achaeans</hi> on each ſide the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the <hi>Theater,</hi> he appeared, armed as he was, from behind the Scenes, his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance much altered by reaſon of his toyle and watching, ſo that the natural ſpirited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and gayety of his temper was overborn and depreſſed by the wearineſs of his body. The People, as ſoon as he came forth, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out into great applauſes and congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, he took his Spear in his right hand, and reſting his knee a little bent, and his body againſt it, ſtood a good while in that poſture, ſilently receiving the ſhouts and acclamations of thoſe, that extoll'd his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and admir'd his fortune; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, ſtanding upright, he began an

Oration in the name of the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the late Action, perſuading the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to aſſociate themſelves to the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> and withal deliver'd up to them the Keys of their gates, which had never <note place="margin">Makes an Oration to the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.</note> been in their power ſince the time of King <hi>Philip;</hi> and for <hi>Antigonus</hi>'s Captains he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed <hi>Archelaus,</hi> whom he had taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> refuſing quarter he cauſed to be ſlain, and for <hi>Perſaeus,</hi> when he ſaw the Caſtle was loſt, he got away to <hi>Cenchreae.</hi> Where ſome time after diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing with one that ſaid to him, <hi>that in his opinion none but a wiſe Philoſopher was fit to be a General,</hi> he reply'd, <hi>The Gods know that none of</hi> Zeno'<hi>s maxims once pleaſed me better than this, but now I am quite of another mind, convinc'd by that</hi> Sicyonian <hi>youth.</hi> This is by many related of <hi>Perſeus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Aratus</hi> preſently after made himſelf maſter of the Temple of <hi>Juno,</hi> and haven of <hi>Lechaeum,</hi> ſeis'd upon five and twenty of the King's ſhips, together with five hundred horſes, and four hundred <hi>Syrian</hi> ſlaves which he ſold. The <hi>Achaeans</hi> alſo put a Garriſon of four hundred Soldiers, fifty Dogs with as many Keepers into <hi>Acro-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthus.</hi> Now the <hi>Romans</hi> extolling <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paemen</hi> called him <hi>the laſt of the Grecians,</hi> as if no great man had ever ſince his time been bred amongſt them, but I may well
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:36410:218"/>
ſay that this was the laſt of the <hi>Grecian</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, being comparable to the beſt of them, both for the daringneſs of it and the ſucceſs as the conſequences declar'd, for the <hi>Megarians</hi> revolting from <hi>Antigonus</hi> took <note place="margin">The good effects of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit.</note> part with <hi>Aratus,</hi> and the <hi>Traezenians,</hi> and <hi>Epidaurians</hi> ingrafted themſelves into the <hi>Achaean Community.</hi> His firſt inroad was into <hi>Attica,</hi> and paſſing over into <hi>Salamis</hi> he plunder'd the <hi>Iſland,</hi> turning the <hi>Achae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> force every way, as now let looſe, and ſet at liberty. Thoſe Priſoners that were Freemen he ſent home to <hi>Athens</hi> without ranſome, inciting them thereby to throw off their fetters; he made <hi>Ptolomy</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Confederate of the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> and their General both by Sea and Land, and ſo great was his power with them, that ſince he could not by Law be choſen their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral every year, yet every other year he was, and by his counſels and actions was in effect always ſo. For they perceived that neither riches nor reputation, not the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Kings, nor the private int'reſt of his own Country, nor any other thing elſe was ſo dear to him as the increaſe of the <hi>Achae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> power and greatneſs. For he believ'd that ſmall Cities could be preſerv'd by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but a continual and combin'd force, united by the bond of common int'reſt; and as the members of the body
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:36410:218"/>
live and breath by their mutual commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication and connexion, and when once ſeparated pine away and putrifie, in the ſame manner are Cities ruin'd by being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred from one another, as well as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, when link'd together into one great body, they enjoy the benefit of that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Counſel that governs the whole.</p>

The Ladder was taken away by his Wenches Mother, and lockt up in another Room, which in the Morning ſhe brought again, and putting it to, called up this Brave and Wonderful Tyrant, who came creeping out like ſome Snake from his hole; whereas <hi>Aratus</hi> not by force of Armes, but Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and by his Vertue, having obtain'd a firmly ſetled Command, wearing an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Garment and Cloak, being the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and declared Enemy of all <hi>Tyrants,</hi>

hath left behind him a noble off-ſpring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining among the <hi>Grecians</hi> to this day; but of thoſe that uſurped ſtrong Caſtles, maintained Life-guards, fenced themſelves with Arms, Gates and Bolts, <hi>moſt like poor Hares</hi> died a violent Death, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Family, or honourable Monument to preſerve their memory.</p>
            <p>Againſt this <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> therefore <hi>Aratus</hi> made many open and ſecret attempts, whileſt he endeavoured to take <hi>Argos,</hi> though without ſucceſs, and particularly clapping ſcaling Ladders one night to the wall he deſperately got up upon it with a few of his Soldiers, and killed the Guards that oppoſed him. But the day appearing, the <hi>Tyrant</hi> ſet upon him on all hands, whileſt the <hi>Argives,</hi> as if it had not been their Liberty that was contended for, but were about to diſtribute the <hi>Nemaean Prizes,</hi> like equal and juſt Spectators ſat looking on in great quietneſs. <hi>Aratus</hi> fighting luſtily was run through the thigh with a Lance, yet he maintain'd his ground againſt the Enemy till night, and had he held out that night alſo, he had gain'd his point; for the <hi>Tyrant</hi> thought of nothing but flying, and had already ſhip'd moſt of his goods; But <hi>Aratus</hi> having no intelligence thereof, and wanting water, being diſabled himſelf by his wound, retreated with his Soldiers,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:36410:220"/>
and deſpairing to do any good this way, fell openly with his Army into <hi>Argolis,</hi> and plunder'd it, and joyning battle with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtippus</hi> near the River <hi>Chares,</hi> he is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have withdrawn out of the fight, and thereby abandon'd the Victory. For whereas one part of his Army had appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently got the better, and was purſuing the Enemy at a good diſtance from him, yet retreated he in great diſorder into his <note place="margin">

<pb n="424" facs="tcp:36410:222"/>
need there could be of his Preſence ſince the dye was caſt, and then went a-loof off to expect the ſucceſs. And ſo much did theſe reports gain credit, that when the Philoſophers diſputed whether to have ones Heart beat, and to change Colour upon any danger, be an argument of fear, or rather of weakneſs and coldneſs of conſtitution, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus</hi> was always quoted, as a valiant Capt. but ſubject to be ſo affected in time of Battle.</p>

was only to be declar'd General of the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> and together with them to have the keeping of the Citadel of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth:</hi> To which <hi>Aratus</hi> returning anſwer that the <hi>Achaean</hi> affairs were not ſo proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Power, as he was in the Power of them, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> believing himſelf to be mock'd and abus'd, immediately invaded the Country of <hi>Sicyon,</hi> deſtroying all with Fire and Sword, and beſieged the City three Months, whileſt <hi>Aratus</hi> was in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with himſelf whether he ſhould call in <hi>Antigonus</hi> upon Condition of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up the Citadel of <hi>Corinth</hi> to him, for he would not lend him aſſiſtance upon any other Terms.

But he having comforted and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd them as well as he could, got on Horſe-back, and being accompany'd with Ten of his Friends, and his Son, then a

But perceiving the preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and Juncture unavoidable, to which thoſe that ſeem to command, are conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to obey, he reſolved to put all to the venture.

For it is reported, that as <hi>Aratus</hi> was not long before offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Sacrifice, there were found in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver two Gall-bags inclos'd in the ſame Caul, whereupon the Southſayer told him, that there ſhould be the ſtricteſt Friendſhip imaginable between him, and his Greateſt and moſt Mortal Enemies: which Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <note place="margin">A Predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd.</note> he at that time ſlighted, having no great Faith in Southſayings and Prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, but depending moſt upon Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Deliberations. But afterwards things ſucceeding well in the War, <hi>Antigonus</hi> made a great Feaſt at <hi>Corinth,</hi> to which he invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a great number of Gueſts, and therein plac'd <hi>Aratus</hi> next above himſelf, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for a Coverlet, asked him if he did
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:36410:232"/>
not find it Cold, to which <hi>Aratus</hi> replying that he was ready to Shake with Cold, he commanded him to come nearer to him, and ſo the Servants threw the ſame Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let over them both: Then <hi>Aratus</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the Sacrifice fell a Laughing, and told the King what happened to him in that Sacrifice, and the Interpretation of it. But this fell out a good while after. So <hi>Aratus</hi> and the King plighting their Faith to each other at <hi>Pegae,</hi> immediately marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Enemy, with whom they had frequent Skirmiſhes, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> behaving himſelf very well, and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> making a very brisk Defence.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Ariſtotles the Argive</hi>

               <hi>Aratus</hi>'s Friend ſent privately to him, to let him know, that he would cauſe <hi>Argos</hi> to Rebel, if he would come thither in Perſon with ſome Soldiers. <hi>Aratus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted <hi>Antigonus</hi> therewith, and having fifteen hundred men with him, ſailed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> to <hi>Epidaurus.</hi> But the <hi>Argives</hi> had not Patience till he could arrive, but making a ſudden inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection fell upon <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Soldiers, and drove them into the Citadel. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> having notice of this, and fearing leſt, if the Enemy ſhould poſſeſs themſelves of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos,</hi> they might cut off his retreat home, leaves <hi>Acro-Corinth,</hi> and Marched away by

Night to help his Men. He got hither firſt, and beat off the Enemy, but <hi>Aratus</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not long after, and the King approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Forces, he retreated to <hi>Mantinea,</hi> upon which all the Cities again declared for the <hi>Achaeans</hi> and <hi>Antigonus</hi> made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of the <hi>Acro-corinth.

All theſe Miſcarriages they charged him with, not conſidering, that having once put the Reins into <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s hands, he was now hurry'd along by the impetuoſity of the Regal Power, being Maſter of nothing but his Tongue, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of which it was not very ſafe for him to uſe neither. For it was very plain, that <hi>Aratus</hi> was much troubled at ſeveral things, as appears by the buſineſs about the Statues; for <hi>Antigonus</hi> replac'd the Statues of the Tyrants of <hi>Argos</hi> that had been thrown down, and on the contrary threw down the Statues of all thoſe that had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the <hi>Acro-Corinth,</hi> except that of <hi>Aratus,</hi> nor could he by all intreaties divert him from this reſolution. Beſides the uſage of the <hi>Mantineans</hi> by the <hi>Achaeans</hi> ſeems not to ſavour of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Temper and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; for being Maſters of their City by the help of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> they put to death the Chief and moſt Noted men amongſt them: And for the reſt, ſome of them they Sold, others they ſent bound in Fetters into <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi> and made Slaves of their Wives and Children. The Money raiſed hereby was a third Part of it divided amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the other two thirds were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed amongſt the <hi>Macedonians:</hi> and this
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:36410:233"/>
ſeems to have been done by a certain Sort of Legal Revenge; for although it be a Barbarous thing for men of the ſame Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Bloud thus to Butcher one another in their Fury, yet neceſſity makes it, as <hi>Simonides</hi> ſays, Sweet and ſomething ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, being the propereſt Remedy to Appeaſe and Satisfie Inflamed and Exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Minds. But for what was afterwards done to that City, <hi>Aratus</hi> can never be excus'd upon any account, either of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or neceſſity; for the <hi>Argives</hi> having the City freely beſtowed on them by <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus,</hi> and reſolving to People it, he being then Choſen the Director of that affair and being General at that time, decreed, that it ſhould no longer be called <hi>Manti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> but <hi>Antigonea,</hi> which name it ſtill bears; ſo that by this means the Memory of the <hi>Beautiful Mantinea</hi> is quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd, that the City might bear the Name of the Deſtroyer of its Citizens. After this <hi>Cleomenes</hi> being overthrown in a great Battle near <hi>Sellaſiae,</hi> forſook the City of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and Fled into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Antigonus</hi> having ſhown all manner of Civility and Kindneſs to <hi>Aratus,</hi> retired into <hi>Macedonia.</hi>

To all which <hi>Philip</hi> gave him no anſwer, though he appear'd much nettled, and mutter'd often to himſelf whileſt he was ſpeaking; but for the Elder <hi>Aratus,</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take all that he ſaid in good part, being alſo by Nature crafty, and having a good Command of himſelf, he gave him his hand and led him out of the Theater, and carry'd him with him to <hi>Ithome,</hi> to Sacrifice there to <hi>Jupiter</hi> and take a view of the place; for it is a poſt as fortifyable as the <hi>Acro-Corinth,</hi> and with a Garriſon is as ſtrong, and does as much command the neighbouring Country. <hi>Philip</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore went up into this Caſtle, and having offer'd Sacrifice there, receiving the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails with both his hands from the Prieſt, he ſhew'd them to <hi>Aratus</hi> and <hi>Demetrius Pharius,</hi> preſenting them ſometimes to the one, and ſometimes to the other, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them what they judg'd by the tokens in the Sacrifice it were beſt for him to do with the fort, whether to keep it for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or reſtore it to the <hi>Meſſenians. Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> ſmiling anſwer'd him, <hi>if you have in you the Soul of a Prieſt you will reſtore it, but if of a Prince you will hold the Ox by both the horns.</hi> By which <hi>Aenigma</hi> he made him underſtand that <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> would be wholly ſubmiſs and at his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:36410:236"/>
if he added <hi>Ithomata</hi> to the <hi>Acro-Corinth. Aratus</hi> ſaid not a word of a good while, but <hi>Philip</hi> entreating him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his opinion, he ſpoke thus. <q>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great Hills are there in <hi>Crete,</hi> and many Rocks in <hi>Baeotia</hi> and <hi>Phocis,</hi> and many inexpugnable places are there both near the Sea, and in the mid-land in <hi>Acarnania,</hi> and yet all theſe People obey your Orders though you have not poſſeſſed your ſelf of any one of theſe Places. Thieves neſt themſelves in Rocks and Precipices, but the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Fort a King can have is fidelity and affection. Theſe have open'd to you the <hi>Cretian</hi> Sea, theſe made you Maſter of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> and by the help of theſe, young as you are, are you become Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the one, and Lord of the other.</q> As he was thus ſpeaking, <hi>Philip</hi> return'd the entrails to the Prieſt, and pulling him along with him by the hand, come on then ſaid he let us follow this courſe, as if he thought himſelf forced by him, and deprived of the Town.</p>
            <p>From this time <hi>Aratus</hi> began to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from Court, and retir'd by degrees from <hi>Philips</hi> Company; for when he was preparing to march into <hi>Epirus,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd him that he would accompany him thither, he excus'd himſelf and ſtay'd at
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:36410:237"/>
home, apprehending that he ſhould get <note place="margin">

               </note> nothing but diſcredit by his Actions. But when afterwards having ſhamefully loſt his Fleet againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> and miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd in all his deſigns he return'd into <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponneſus,</hi> where indeavouring firſt to win the <hi>Meſſenians</hi> by his artifices, and failing therein, he fell openly to ſpoil and waſt their Country, then <hi>Aratus</hi> fell out with him downright, and utterly renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his Friendſhip. For he began then to ſmell out the injuries done to his Son in his Wife, and though they vexed him to the heart, yet he concealed them from him for he could onely let him know he had been abuſed but could not help him to the means to revenge himſelf; for ſtrange and unexpected was the change made in <hi>Philip,</hi> who of a mild King, and modeſt and chaſt Youth, became a laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious man and moſt cruel Tyrant; though in reality this was not a change of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but a bold unmasking of his ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, being no longer in awe of any man, which by reaſon of his fear he had a long time diſſembled. For that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he from the beginning bore to <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> had a great allay of fear and awe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears evidently from what he did to him at laſt. For being deſirous to put him to death, not thinking himſelf, whileſt he was alive,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:36410:237"/>
to be at liberty either as King or Tyrant; he durſt not attempt to do it by open force but commanded <hi>Taurion</hi> one of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Familiars to make him away ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, and that by poiſon in his abſence. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Taurion</hi> poiſons <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus</hi> by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Philip.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Taurion</hi> therefore contracted a friendſhip with <hi>Aratus,</hi> and gave him a doſe not of your ſtrong and violent poiſons, but ſuch as cauſe gentle hectical heats, and a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Cough, and ſo by degrees bring on certain death. <hi>Aratus</hi> perceiv'd what was done to him, but knowing that it was in vain to make any words of it, bore it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently and with ſilence as if it had been ſome common and uſual diſtemper.

            <p>But there being an ancient Law that no perſon ſhould be bury'd within the Walls of their City, and a ſtrong ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition

            </head>
            <p>THE firſt <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> among all the Crowned Heads of <hi>Perſia,</hi> the moſt remarkable for a Meek and Noble Spirit, was ſurnamed <hi>Longimanus;</hi> his right hand being longer than his left: And he was the Son of <hi>Xerxes.</hi> The ſecond whoſe Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I am now writing, being for his vaſt memory ſtil'd <hi>Mnemon,</hi> was his Grand-ſon by his Daughter <hi>Paryſatis:</hi> Who brought <hi>Darius</hi> four Sons, the Eldeſt <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> the next <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and two younger than
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:36410:241"/>
theſe <hi>Oſtanes,</hi> and <hi>Oxathers.</hi> That <hi>Cyrus</hi> borrow'd his Name of the ancient <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as they ſay he had his from the Sun, which in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Language is call'd <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi> And <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was at firſt call'd <hi>Arſicas,</hi> though <hi>Dinon</hi> ſays <hi>Oartes.</hi> But it is highly improbable that <hi>Cteſias</hi> (though otherwiſe he has caſt into his book an univerſal Rapſody of incredible and ſenſeleſs Fables) ſhould be ignorant of the name of the King, as being Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian in ordinary to him, his Wife, his Mother, and Children. This <hi>Cyrus</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently even in his tender years, was fierce and violent; on the other ſide <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> ſeem'd in all reſpects more gentle and more ſoft, more effeminate in his Paſſions. He marry'd a Fair and Vertuous Lady with the conſent of his Parents, but kept her as expreſly againſt it. For King <hi>Darius</hi> having put her brother to death, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting likewiſe how to deſtroy her too. But <hi>Arſicas</hi> throwing himſelf at his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Feet, and having mov'd her with whole ſtreams of tears, at laſt with much ado perſuaded her that they ſhould neither put to death, nor divorce that his dear Conſort from him. However <hi>Cyrus</hi> was the Queens darling, and the Son whom ſhe moſt deſir'd to ſettle in the Throne. And therefore his Father <hi>Darius</hi> now ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:36410:241"/>
ill, and he being ſent for from Sea to Court, ſet out thence with a full gale of hopes, that by her means he ſhoul'd be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd his Succeſſor in the Empire. For <hi>Paryſatis</hi> urg'd this ſpecious plea in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, which <hi>Xerxes</hi> by the advice of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maratus</hi> had of old made uſe of, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſhe had brought him <hi>Arſicas,</hi> when he was a Subject, but <hi>Cyrus</hi> when a King. Notwithſtanding ſhe prevail'd not with <hi>Darius,</hi> but the eldeſt Son <hi>Arſicas</hi> was pronounc'd King, his name being chang'd into <hi>Artaxerxes;</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> left Prefect of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and Duke of the Maritine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. It was not long after the deceaſe of <hi>Darius</hi> before his Succeſſour went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Paſargades,</hi> that he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate the ceremony of his Inaugurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Perſean Prieſt.</hi> There is a Temple dedicated to a Warlike Goddeſs, which a man would gueſs to be <hi>Minerva;</hi> into which, when the Royal Perſon to be anointed has paſs'd he muſt ſtrip himſelf of his own robe, and put on that which <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Firſt wore before he attain'd to the Monarchy, then having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd a frail of Figs he muſt eat Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and drink a cup made of vinegar and milk. To which if they ſuperadd any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rites, it is unknown to any but thoſe that are preſent at them. Now <hi>Artaxerx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi>
               <pb n="462" facs="tcp:36410:242"/>
being about to addreſs himſelf to this Solemnity, <hi>Tiſaphernes</hi> came to him bringing a certain Prieſt, who having train'd up <hi>Cyrus</hi> in his Youth according to the eſtabliſh'd Diſcipline of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and having taught him Philoſophy was likely to be as much concern'd as any man that his Pupil mounted not the Throne. And for that reaſon his veracity was the leſs queſtioned when he charged <hi>Cyrus</hi> as tho' he had been about to lie in wait for the King in the Temple, and to aſſault and aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinate him as he was putting off his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Some affirm that he was apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this impeachment, others that he had entered the Temple and was point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out there, as he lay lurking, by the Prieſt. But as he was going to Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Mother claſpt him in her Arms, and having bound him with the treſſes of her hair ſhe joyn'd his neck cloſe to her own, and by her bitter lamentation, by her moſt formal interceſſion to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> for him ſhe revers'd the decree; and he remanded him to his former Province. In which he ſate uneaſie, nor did he ſo well remember his delivery as his chain, being through his rage more eagerly deſirous of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom than before. Some ſay that he revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his Royal Brother, becauſe he had not a revenue proportionable to the daily
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:36410:242"/>
expence he was at in the ſupport of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, in that proclaiming him no leſs fool than Rebel. For had he had nothing elſe, yet he had a Mother ready with a ſtretcht<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hand to ſupply him with whatever he could deſire whether for his uſe or Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur. But the great number of Soldiers, who being hired from many places were maintained, as <hi>Xenophon</hi> informs us, for his ſervice, by his Confidents both Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick and Foreign do ſufficiently evince his riches. For he aſſembled them not toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Body, as yet concealing his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize; But he had Agents every where liſting ſtrangers upon ſeveral pretences. Now both <hi>Paryſatis</hi> being at Court with his Majeſty, remov'd all jealouſies, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> himſelf always wrote in an humble and dutifull manner to him; one while ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciting Princely bounty, another draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Counter-charge againſt <hi>Tiſaphernes,</hi> as if his emulation and conteſt had been wholly with him. Moreover there was a certain natural dilatorineſs in the King, which was miſtaken by many for Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Yet indeed in the beginning of his Reign he ſeem'd to exemplifie the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the firſt <hi>Artaxexes,</hi> being more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible in his Perſon, and exceſſive in the diſtribution both of honours and rewards to the deſerving. He was obliging even in his
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:36410:243"/>
puniſhments taking out the ſting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely of them, and in the intercourſe of gifts he delighted no otherwiſe in thoſe that offer'd them to, than in thoſe that receiv'd them from him, appearing ſtill when he gave chearful and generous. Nor truly was there any thing, however inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble given him, which he did not deign kindly to accept of; inſomuch that when one <hi>Omiſes</hi> had preſented him with a very large Pomegranate, by this light, ſaid he, this man, were he entruſted with it, would ſoon turn a ſmall City into a great one. Afterwards ſome offering him one thing, ſome another, as he was in his Progreſs, a certain poor Labourer having got nothing in a readineſs to make a preſent to him of, ran ſtreight to the River ſide, and taking up water in his hands he offer'd it to him; with which <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was ſo well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that he ſent him a large goblet of maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy Gold, and a thouſand <hi>Darius</hi>'s. And to <hi>Euclidas</hi> a <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> ſpeaking many things to him like a frontleſs, arrogant fellow, he commanded one of his Tribunes thus to expreſs himſelf from him, that I give thee leave to ſay what thou wilt to me, but remember that I, as King, may ſay and do too what I pleaſe. At a Hunt <hi>Tiribazus</hi> having ſhew'd him that his Robe was rent, he demanded of him what he
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:36410:243"/>
ſhould do? He anſwering, it may pleaſe your Majeſty to put on another and give me that; the King did ſo, ſaying withal, I beſtow this on thee <hi>Tiribazus,</hi> but I charge thee not to wear it. He, little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the injunction laid upon him (tho' he was no obſtinately ill, but only an empty half-witted Man) ſtreightway put the Gown on his back, and bedeckt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with jewels of Gold, and Womaniſh attire, at which the whole Court was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry; it being abſolutely againſt the Laws of <hi>Perſia,</hi> for any but the Kings to wear them. But his Majeſty laugh'd at him, and told him, thou haſt my leave to wear thoſe Golden toys as a Woman, and the Robe of State as a Fool.</p>
            <p>And whereas none uſually ſate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>down to eat with the King beſide his Mother and Wife, the former being plac'd above, the other below him; <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> invited alſo to his table his two younger Brothers <hi>Oſtanes</hi> and <hi>Oxathres.</hi> But the Chariot of his Wife <hi>Statira</hi> preſented the <hi>Perſians</hi> with the moſt taking ſight, being always drawn with its Curtains down, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ladies of the Country both to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and approach her. Which thing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear'd his Government to the People. Yet ſome over buſie, Factious men that delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in innovation, gave it out, as their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:36410:244"/>
that <hi>Cyrus,</hi> being a man of a great ſpirit, and excellent Warriour, and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Maſter, was in theſe circumſtances deſirable, and that the largeneſs of their Empire abſolutely required a daring and ambitious Prince. <hi>Cyrus</hi> then not only relying upon thoſe of his own Low Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince near the Sea, but upon many of thoſe in the higher Countrys near the King, attempts a War againſt him. He wrote likewiſe to the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> exciting them to his aſſiſtance, and to ſupply him with ſome ſtout men, aſſuring them that to the Foot-men that ſhould appear he would give Horſes, and to the Horſemen Chariots; that upon thoſe who had Farms he would beſtow Lordſhips, that thoſe who were Lords of Villages, he would make ſo of Cities, and that thoſe who would be his Soldiers ſhould receive their pay not ſtinted by account, but in a full heapt meaſure. Beſides among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things he fondly extoll'd himſelf, for he ſaid he was informed with a greater Soul, that he was more a Philoſopher and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Magician, and that he could both drink and bear more Wine than his Brother <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes:</hi> who as he averr'd, through fear and effeminacy did neither in his Chaces ride his horſe nor in dangers ſit without tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering upon his Throne. The <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
               <pb n="467" facs="tcp:36410:244"/>
his Letter being read, ſent a Billet to <hi>Clearchus</hi> commanding him to obey <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> in all things. So <hi>Cyrus</hi> march'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King, having under his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct a numerous hoſt of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and but little leſs than thirteen thouſand Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendary <hi>Grecians;</hi> aſſigning firſt one cauſe, then another for his expedition. Yet the true reaſon lay not long conceal'd, but <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphernes</hi> went to the King in perſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it. Thereupon the Court was all in an uproar and tumult, the Queens Mother bearing almoſt the whole blame of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, and her retainers being not only ſuſpected but accuſed. But ſhe who gave her the moſt diſturbance was <hi>Statira,</hi> who paſſionately reſented this War, and cry'd out; what is now become of your Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? What of your Interceſſions? By which having free'd him that had been guilty of Treaſon againſt his Brother, you have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil'd us in War and Troubles? For which words <hi>Paryſatis</hi> hating <hi>Statira,</hi> and being naturally implicable and ſavage in her anger and revenge, ſhe conſulted how ſhe might deſtroy her. But ſince <hi>Dinon</hi> has left it upon Record, that her bloody pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject took effect in the time of War, and <hi>Cteſias</hi> after it; I ſhall not quarrel the Chronology of the latter: it being very unlikely, that he, who was a Spectator
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:36410:245"/>
of the whole Scene of affairs, ſhould not know where to fix the Aera of one ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. Nor indeed had he any cauſe deſignedly to miſplace its date in his Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of it, though in his Hiſtory upon other occaſions he frequently makes excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from truth to meer Fiction and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>
            <p>Now as <hi>Cyrus</hi> was upon the march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Court, tidings were brought him, as though the King did deliberate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and were not in haſte to fight and preſently to joyn battle with him; but to wait in the heart of his Kingdom, till there ſhould be a general confluence of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thither from all parts of his Dominions. And to convince him of this news he had caſt a Trench in his way ten fadoms in breadth, and as many in depth, the length of it being no leſs than four hundred fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs. Nor did he regard <hi>Cyrus</hi> after he had paſs'd over it, being within that place for which it was made a fence, till he had advanc'd almoſt to the City of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Then <hi>Tiribazus,</hi> as the report goes, being the firſt that was ſo hardy to tell his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, that he ought not to defer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, nor quitting <hi>Medea, Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Suſa,</hi> poorly to skulk in <hi>Perſea,</hi> as having an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my far more numerous than his Enemies and an infinite Company both of Nobles,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:36410:245"/>
and Captains that were greater Soldiers and <hi>Politicians</hi> than <hi>Cyrus</hi> himſelf; he reſolv'd to begin the fight, as ſoon as 'twas poſſible for him. Thereupon at firſt, and in an inſtant, appearing gloriouſly at the head of nine hundred thouſand well marſhall'd men, he ſo ſtartl'd and ſurpris'd the Rebels, who with a boldneſs equal to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt march'd againſt him neither in order nor well arm'd, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> with much noiſe and tumult was ſcarce able to range and compoſe them. Then the King leading on his men ſilently, and by leiſure, made the <hi>Grecians</hi> ſtand amaz'd at his good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, who expected irregular ſhouting and leaping, a huge confuſion and diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſo infinite a multitude as that was. He alſo wiſely plac'd the choice of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Chariots in the Front of his own Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanx, over againſt the <hi>Grecian</hi> Troops, that by the fierceneſs of their onſet, they might cut down their ranks before they clos'd with them.</p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as this battle hath been deſcrib'd by many Hiſtorians, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by <hi>Xenophon,</hi> who repreſents it to the eye by pointing at things, not as tho' paſt but preſent, and by his lively draught of it, engages his hearer when recited in a ſeeming concern and danger; it would be folly in me to give any larger account
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:36410:246"/>
of it then barely to mention thoſe things which he has omitted, and yet deſerve to be recorded. The place then in which the two Armies were drawn out for the fight, was call'd <hi>Cunaxa,</hi> being about five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred furlongs diſtant from <hi>Babylon;</hi> where <hi>Clearchus</hi> beſeeching <hi>Cyrus,</hi> before the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, to retire behind the Battalion of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians,</hi> and not expoſe himſelf to hazard; for his honour, they ſay, he thus replied, What ſtrange advice is this <hi>Clearchus?</hi> Would you have me, who aſpire to the Empire, appear to all theſe unworthy of it; But as <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s offence was in ruſhing head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the midſt of dangers, and not keeping aloof from what threatned him with ruine; ſo <hi>Clearchus</hi> was as much too blame, if not more, who refus'd with his men to confront the main body of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, where the King ſtood, and joyn'd his right wing to the River, for fear he ſhould be ſurrounded. For aiming altogether at ſafety, and deſiring nothing but to ſleep in a whole Skin, it had been his beſt way not to have ſtirred from home. But he having come armed a vaſt diſtance from the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt, no other thing inducing him to it, but that he might ſettle <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Throne; and yet afterwards looking out for a Place and Station, wherein he took footing, not that he might preſerve
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:36410:246"/>
him under whoſe pay and conduct he was, but that he might himſelf engage with more eaſe and ſecurity, ſeem'd much like one that through fear of preſent dangers had quitted the conſideration of his all at ſtake, and been falſe to the deſign of his expedition. For it is evident from the very event of the battle, that none of thoſe who were in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray round the Kings perſon were able to ſtand the Shock of the <hi>Grecians</hi> Charge; and had they been beaten out of the Field, and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> either fled or fallen, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> by his conqueſt had purchas'd not only ſafety, but a Crown. And therefore <hi>Clearchus</hi> is more to be condemned for his caution, which was manifeſtly the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Life and Fortune of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> than he could be for his heat and raſhneſs. For had the King made it his buſineſs to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a place, where having poſted the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> he might incounter them with the leaſt hazard, he would never have found out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, but that which was moſt remote from himſelf and thoſe near him; from whence when he was routed, he was inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it; and tho' <hi>Clearchus</hi> had the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet <hi>Cyrus</hi> being ignorant of it made no advantage of it before his fall. Yet he knew well enough what was expedient to be done, and accordingly commanded <hi>Clearchus</hi> with his men to ſtand in the middle of his
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:36410:247"/>
Forces: Who when he had reply'd that it ſhould be as well manag'd as poſſible, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſpoiled all. For the <hi>Grecians,</hi> where they were, hew'd down the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> till they were weary, and chas'd them ſucceſsfully a very great way. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> being mounted upon a fierce, head-ſtrong and unlucky Horſe, as <hi>Cteſias</hi> ſays, call'd <hi>Paſacas; Artagerſes</hi> the Leader of the <hi>Caduſians</hi> galloped up to him, crying aloud, O thou moſt unjuſt and ſenſeleſs wretch who art a reproach to that moſt Auguſt and Honourable Name among the <hi>Perſeans, Cyrus,</hi> thou art come leading on the renowned <hi>Grecians</hi> in an ominous Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to the plunder of thy Countrymen. Thou fondly hopeſt too, unnatural Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour as thou art, to deſtroy thy Sovereign and Brother; who, as thou ſhalt ſoon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally perceive, is maſter of ten thouſand times ten thouſand better men than thou art. For thou ſhalt certainly here loſe thy head, before thou ſeeſt the face of our King; which when he had ſaid he caſt his Javelin at him. But his Coat of male ſtoutly repelled it, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> was not wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet the ſtroke falling heavy upon him, he reel'd upon his Steed. Then <hi>Artagerſes</hi> turning his Horſe, <hi>Cyrus</hi> luckily threw a Dart, and ſtruck the point of it through his neck near the Shoulder-bone: So that
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:36410:247"/>
thereupon it is indeed almoſt univerſally own'd that <hi>Artagerſes</hi> was ſlain by him.</p>
            <p>Now as to the death of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſince <hi>Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon,</hi> as being himſelf no eye-witneſs of it, toucheth upon it but lightly, and in few words; it may not be amiſs perhaps to run over on the one hand what <hi>Dinon,</hi> and on the other what <hi>Cteſias</hi> has ſaid of it. <hi>Dinon</hi> then affirms that the death of <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerſes, Cyrus</hi> having violently attack'd the Vanguard of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> wounded his horſe, and ſo was he diſmounted; and when <hi>Tiribazus</hi> had ſoon lifted him up upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſaid to him my Liege, remember this day, which ought not to be forgotten, that <hi>Cyrus</hi> again ſpurring up his horſe ſtruck down <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> But at the third aſſault the King being enrag'd, and ſaying to thoſe near him, that death was more eligible than ſuch inſolence, he made up to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who madly and blindly ruſh'd upon the Spears of the Enemy. So the King ſtruck him with his javelin, as likewiſe did all thoſe that were round about him. And thus <hi>Cyrus</hi> falls, as ſome ſay, by the hand of the King; as others by the Dart of a <hi>Carian,</hi> whom <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> for a reward of that his atchievment did the honour to ſet him ever after bear a Golden Cock upon his Spear before the firſt rank of his Army. For the <hi>Perſians</hi> call thoſe of <hi>Caria</hi> Cocks, by reaſon
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:36410:248"/>
of the Creſts with which they adorn their Helmets.</p>
            <p>But the account of <hi>Cteſias,</hi> that I may draw in little what he has branch'd out at large, is thus as follows; <hi>Cyrus</hi> after the ſlaughter of <hi>Artagerſes</hi> rode up fiercely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King, as he did againſt him, not either exchanged a word with the other, But <hi>Arieus Cyrus</hi>'s confident darted firſt at the King, yet wounded him not. Then the King let fly a Dart at his Brother, but miſs'd him, though he both hit and ſlew <hi>Tiſaphernes,</hi> a man truly generous, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the intereſt of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who having directed his Lance with a ſurer hand againſt the King, pierced his breaſt with it quite through his Armour two inches deep, ſo that he tumbled with this ſtroke upon the Earth. At which thoſe that attended him being put to flight and diſorder, he riſing with a few, among whom was <hi>Cteſias,</hi> and recovering a little Hill not far off reſted himſelf. But <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s horſe being high-met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled carry'd him a great way into the midſt of his Enemies, the approaching night ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it hard for them to know him, or his followers to find him. However being made fierce with conqueſt, being withal naturally bold and violent, he paſs'd thro' them crying out, and that more than once in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Language ſubmit your ſelves
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:36410:248"/>
poor men, ſubmit; which they indeed did throwing themſelves down at his feet. Then his Tiara (which kind of Hat none but Princes of the blood, or Generals wore) dropt off his head, and a luſty young <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> by name <hi>Mythridates</hi> rnnning by, and not knowing who he was, with a Dart pierced one of his Temples near his Eye out of which wound much blood guſh'd, ſo that <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſwooning and ſenſeleſs, fell off his horſe, which ſtragling ran away. from him. But <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s Mate gather'd up the Capariſon of his horſe, and his Cap that had ſlipt off all dyed with Gore. Then ſome few <hi>Eunuchs</hi> that were with him, being by reaſon of that ſtroak ſcarcely and with much difficulty come to himſelf, endeavour'd to mount him upon another horſe, and ſo to convey him ſafe away. Now becauſe he was not able to ride, nor to walk without great toil by himſelf, they led and ſupported him, being indeed in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy vertiginous and reeling, but heal'd in his mind by the comfortable thoughts of his Victory; whileſt he hears the vanquiſtt ſalute the King, and ſhew to their Lord and Maſter <hi>Cyrus</hi> for Grace and Mercy: In the mean time ſome wretched and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>Caunians,</hi> who upon the account of ſome vile employments follow'd the Royal ſtandard, were by chance joyn'd with thoſe
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:36410:249"/>
attendants of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> ſuppoſing them to be of their own party. But as ſoon as they diſcover'd their red coats, when all the Loyal Subjects wore white ones; they knew that they were Enemies. One there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of them not dreaming that it was <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> ventur'd to ſtrike him behind with his Spear. So <hi>Cyrus</hi> being ham-ſtring'd and falling, he did at the ſame time daſh his wounded Temple againſt a Stone, and dy'd. Thus runs <hi>Cteſias</hi> account, wherein me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks he as it were, with a dull knife ſaws him to death, and has much ado to ſhut up the Tragedy. As he now lay dead <hi>Arto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyras</hi> his Majeſties Intelligencer, it ſeems, paſſed by on horſe-back; and having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> of <hi>Cyrus</hi> dolefully deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Fate, he ask't <hi>Pariſcas</hi> the moſt truſty of them; ſaying, whom doſt thou ſit by here Lamenting? He reply'd, do not you ſee, O! <hi>Artoſyras,</hi> that it is my maſter <hi>Cyrus?</hi> Then <hi>Artoſyras</hi> wondring bid the <hi>Eunuch</hi> be of good Chear, and keep the dead Body ſafe. So going in all haſte to <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> (who now diſpaired of the ſucceſs of his affairs, and was highly indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd both by his drowth and wound) he with much joy aſſur'd him that he had ſeen <hi>Cyrus</hi> dead. Thereupon he preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd in perſon to go to the place, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Artoſyras</hi> to conduct him where
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:36410:249"/>
he lay. Yet ſeeing there was a great noiſe made about the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and that they were become formidable, as being ſaid to be in Chace of their Enemies, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and carry all before them; he thought fit to ſend out no leſs than thirty men with Torches in their hands to inquire more fully into the truth of the matter. In the interim there being in appearance, but a few ſteps between him and death, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his thirſt; his Enunch <hi>Satibarzanes</hi> ran about ſeeking out drink for him. For the place had no water in it, and he was then at a good diſtance from his Camp. After a long ſearch he at laſt luckily met with one of thoſe poor <hi>Caunian</hi> Slaves, who had in a naſty leathern Bottle about four pints of baſe ſtinking water; which he took, and bare, and gave it to the King, which when he had drunk all off, <hi>Sati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barzanes</hi> ask't him if he did not altogether loath that nauſeous draught; but he ſwore by all he thought Sacred, that he never drank wine with ſuch a guſt, nor water though out of the ſwifteſt or pureſt Stream. And therefore, ſays he, if after a hearty deſire to reward him, who gave thee this, I ſhall not have opportunity to do it, I humbly beg of Heaven, to make him rich and proſperous. No ſooner had he ſaid this, but his thirty <hi>Scouts</hi> arriv'd with joy,
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:36410:250"/>
and triumph in their looks, bringing him the tidings of his unexpected fortune. And now he was encouraged, by the great number and confluence of his Soldiers that flockt to him, and he deſcended into the plain, with many lights and flambeaus round about him. As ſoon as he came near the dead Traitour, and according to a certain law of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> his right hand, and head were lopt off from his body; he gave a ſtrict charge that the latter ſhould be brought to him, and graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the hair of it, which was long and buſhy, he ſhewed it to his men, as they were wavering, and ſtill upon the Wing. Who were amazed at it, and did him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; ſo that there were preſently ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand of them got about him, and entered the Camp again together. He led out to the fight, (as <hi>Cteſias</hi> affirms) four hundred thouſand. But <hi>Dinon</hi> and <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> aver that there were many more than forty Myriads actually engaged. As to the number of the ſlain, as the Catalogue of them was given up to <hi>Artaxerxes; Cteſias</hi> ſays they were nine thouſand, but that they appear'd to him no fewer than twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Neither of which accounts is without Controverſie.</p>
            <p>But that is a manifeſt untruth of his to ſay that he was ſent along with <hi>Phayllus</hi>
               <pb n="479" facs="tcp:36410:250"/>
the <hi>Zacynthian,</hi> and ſome others to the <hi>Grecians.</hi> For <hi>Xenophon</hi> knew well enough that <hi>Cteſias</hi> was always reſident at Court; for he makes mention of him in that Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, of which he is certainly the Author. And therefore had he come, and been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the interpreter of ſuch momentous words; <hi>Xenophon</hi> ſure would not have ſtruck his name out of the Embaſſy any more than he did that of <hi>Phayllus.</hi> But <hi>Cteſias</hi> (as 'tis evident) being ſtrangely vain-glorious and no leſs a favourer of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Clearches,</hi> never fails to aſſume to himſelf ſome Province in his nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, with which being taken up he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords many and glorious things of <hi>Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> and <hi>Sparta.</hi> When the battle was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> ſent goodly and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent gifts to the Son of <hi>Artagerſes,</hi> whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſlew. He conferr'd likewiſe high ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours upon <hi>Cteſias</hi> and others, and having found out the <hi>Caunian,</hi> who gave him the bottle of water, he made him of a poor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure man a rich Peer. As for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he inflicted upon delinquents, there was a kind of harmony betwixt them and the crimes. He gave order that one <hi>Arbaces</hi> a <hi>Mede,</hi> that had fled in the fight to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and again deſerted him at his fall, ſhould take up a Whore ſtark naked, and carry her hanging by his neck a whole day round
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:36410:251"/>
about the Market-place; as one that cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd his Cowardice and Effeminacy, not his treaſon and malice. Another, beſides that he had revolted to them, having falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vaunted that he had kill'd two of the Rebels; he decreed that three needles ſhould be ſtruck through his tongue. Now both ſuppoſing that with his own hand he had cut off <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and being willing that all men ſhould think and ſay ſo, he richly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented <hi>Mithridates</hi> who firſt wounded him, and charg'd thoſe by whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd the gifts to him to tell him, that his Majeſty hath honoured you with theſe his favours becauſe you found and brought him the horſe-trappings, and hat of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> The <hi>Carian</hi> alſo by whom <hi>Cyrus</hi> being wounded in the Ham died, ſuing for his reward; he commanded thoſe that brought it him to ſay that the King preſents you with this as a ſecondary gratification for the good news told him: for firſt <hi>Artoſyrus,</hi> and next to him, you aſſur'd him of the deceaſe of the grand Traitor. So <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> retir'd without Clamour indeed, yet with much trouble and high reſentments. But the unfortunate <hi>Carian</hi> was poſſeſs'd through his indiſcretion with a common infirmity. For being raviſh'd with the ſight of the Princely gifts that were before him, and being tempted thereupon to challenge
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:36410:251"/>
and aſpire to things above him, he deign'd not to accept the Kings preſent, as a retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution for his indiligence; but ſtorming, appeal'd to witneſſes, and declar'd it aloud, that he, and none but he had kill'd <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and that he was with no ſmall injury de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of that Glory. Theſe words, when they came to his ear, did much exaſperate the King, ſo that forthwith he ſentenced him to be beheaded. But the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being in the Kings preſence, ſaid, let not your Majeſty upon ſuch eaſie terms diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge this pernicious <hi>Carian,</hi> rather let me deal out to him the chaſtiſement for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent expreſſions. When he had conſign'd him over to the Mercy of <hi>Paryſatis,</hi> ſhe charg'd the Executioners to take up the man, and ſtretch him upon the rack for ten days, then punching out his eyes to drop molten braſs into his ears till he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd with the very anguiſh of his tortures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mithridates</hi> alſo, within a ſhort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, miſerably periſhed by his own folly: For being invited to a Feaſt where the King and Queen Mothers Eunuchs were, he came array'd in cloth of Gold, a Robe he received from the King. After they went to eat, the Eunuch that was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Favourite of <hi>Paryſatis,</hi> thus ſpeaks to him; A lovely Garment ſurely <hi>Mithridates</hi> is this his Majeſty has given you, the Chains
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:36410:252"/>
and Bracelets are glorious, your Scymeter of invaluable worth: How happy hath he made you, and the object of every eye? To whom he being a little pot-valiant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, What are theſe things <hi>Sparamixes?</hi> Sure I am, I ſhew'd my ſelf to the King in that day of Tryal to be one deſerving more ſtately and ſpecious gifts than theſe. At which <hi>Sparamixes</hi> ſmiling, ſaid, I do not malign or envy you <hi>Mithridates,</hi> but ſince the <hi>Grecians</hi> tell us, that Wine is the Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Truth, I would ask you, my Friend, what glorious or mighty matter was it to find a Hat, that had ſlipt off a Horſe, and to bring it to the King? And this he ſpoke, not as ignorant of the truth, but deſiring to unboſome him to the company, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd the vanity of the man, made ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernably talkative by drink. He according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly could not forbear expreſſing himſelf to this effect, Talk you what you pleaſe of Horſe-trappings, Hats, and ſuch trifles: I tell you plainly, that this hand was the bane of <hi>Cyrus:</hi> For I threw not my dart as <hi>Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerſes</hi> did in vain and to no purpoſe, but hitting him and piercing him through the Temple very near his Eye, I proſtrated the Man and he died of that wound. Then the reſt with dejected looks did already read the deſtiny and ruine of <hi>Mithridates.</hi> But he who treated them, ſaid to him, Prithy,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:36410:252"/>
my Friend, let us eat and drink now, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereing the good fortune of our Prince, and let us wave this diſcourſe, which is too weighty for and above us. Preſently after <hi>Sparamixes</hi> told <hi>Paryſatis</hi> what he ſaid, and ſhe told the King; who was wonderfully enrag'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it, as having the lie given him thereby, and being in danger to loſe the moſt glorious and moſt pleaſant circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Conqueſt. For it was his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that every one, whether Greek or Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian, ſhould believe, that in the mutual aſſaults and conflicts between him and his Brother, he giving and receiving a blow, was himſelf indeed wounded, but that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſt his life. And therefore he decreed, that <hi>Mithridates</hi> ſhould be put to death in Boats, which execution is after the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner. Taking two Boats fram'd exactly to fit and anſwer each other, they lay down in one of them the Malefactor that ſuffers, upon his back; then covering it with the other, and ſo ſetting them together, that through the oppoſite ſections, the head, hands and feet of them may be kept out, and the reſt of his body lie hidden within; they offer him food, and if he refuſe to eat it, they force him to do it, by picking his eyes; then having eaten they drench him with a mixture of Milk and Honey for a Portion, not only pouring it into his mouth,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:36410:253"/>
but all over his face; which ſince they conſtantly turn his eyes directly towards the Sun, wholly diſappears by reaſon of the multitude of Flies, that ſtick cloſe to it: And diſcharging that within, which thoſe that eat and drink muſt needs do, creepers and vermine ſpring out of the corruption and rottenneſs of the excrement, by which peircing into the very bowels of him, his body is conſum'd. So when the man is manifeſtly dead, the uppermoſt being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, they ſee his fleſh devour'd, and ſwarms of ſuch noiſom creatures preying upon, as it were growing to his inwards. Thus <hi>Mithridates</hi> languiſhing for ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days at laſt expired.</p>

Whereas therefore he was ſo circumſpect, that he gave her no advantage againſt him, ſhe fram'd this kind of ſnare for him. She was a very ingenions woman upon other accounts, but an excellent Artiſt at Dice, and therefore before the War had often played with the King: After the War too, when he was at leaſure, and inclin'd to melancolly, ſhe challeng'd him to play at dice with her for a thouſand <hi>Darius</hi>'s, and willingly let him win them, and paid him down in Gold, yet pretending to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:36410:253"/>
for her loſs, and that ſhe would gladly have beaten him, ſhe preſs'd him to begin a new Game for an Eunuch; in which he comply'd with her. But firſt they agreed, that each o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> them might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept five of the moſt truſty Eunuchs, and that out of the reſt of them, the Loſer ſhould yield up any the Winner ſhould make choice of. Upon theſe conditions they play'd. Thus being vigorous upon her deſign, and intent upon her Game, and the Dice running luckily for her, when ſhe had got the Game, ſhe pitcht upon <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabates,</hi> who was not in the number of the five excepted. Now before the King could ſuſpect the matter, having delivered him up to the Tormentors, ſhe ſtrictly enjoyn'd them to flea him alive, to nail his diſtort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed body to three Croſſes, and to ſtretch his skin upon ſtakes ſeparately from it.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being done, and the King taking them hainouſly, and being hugely incens'd againſt her, ſhe with raillery and laughter told him, You are a jolly and happy man indeed, if you are ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb'd for the ſake of an old raſcally Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, when I, though I have thrown away a thouſand Darius's, exclaim not at, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in my fortune. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> then repenting that he had been thus deluded by her, huſh'd up all. But <hi>Statira</hi> did
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:36410:254"/>
both upon other accounts evidently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her, and was irreconcilably angry with her for this, that ſhe did againſt all law and humanity ſacrifice the Eunuchs, and the King's loyal Subjects to the Ghoſt of her darling <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now after that <hi>Tiſaphernes</hi> had circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and with Oaths perfidiouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd <hi>Clearchus</hi> and other Leaders, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them, had ſent them bound in Chains to the King; <hi>Cteſias</hi> ſays, that he was importun'd by <hi>Clearchus,</hi> to ſupply him with a Comb, and that when he had it, and had comb'd his head with it, he was much pleas'd with the uſe of it, and gave him a Ring, which might be a token of their intimacy to all his Relations and Friends in <hi>Sparta;</hi> and that the Sculpture in this Signet, was a ſett of grave Matrons dancing. He tells us that the Soldiers his fellow captives, did ſubduct from, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the food ſent to <hi>Clearchus,</hi> giving him but little or nothing of it. Which thing <hi>Cte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> ſays he rectified, cauſing a better al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to be convey'd to him, and that a diſtinct ſhare ſhould be diſtributed to the Soldiers by themſelves; adding that he miniſter'd to, and ſupply'd him thus at the expence and inſtance of <hi>Paryſatis.</hi> Now there being a Gammon of Bacon daily carry'd to <hi>Clearchus,</hi> among other diſhes,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:36410:254"/>
he ſaid, that ſhe advis'd and inſtructed him, that he ought, ſtriking it over head in the fleſh, and hiding it, to ſend him a ſmall knife, and not ſuffer the fate of his Friend to be diſpenc'd by the tyranny of the King. But withal he aſſures us, that through fear and tenderneſs he refus'd it, and the rather, becauſe <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had promis'd and ſworn to his Mother, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to ſpare <hi>Clearchus,</hi> that he would do ſo: Yet he ſays, that afterwards, at the inſtigation of his Wife <hi>Statira,</hi> he put e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man of them to death beſides <hi>Menon,</hi> and that thence forwards <hi>Paryſatis</hi> watcht her advantage againſt <hi>Statira,</hi> and made up Poiſon for her; affirming therein im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable things, and ſuch as imply the unparallel'd raſhneſs of her Guilt, if ſhe committed ſo execrable an Act, as to dare, out of reſpect to <hi>Clearchus,</hi> to attempt the life of the lawful Queen, that was Mother to thoſe, who were Heirs of the Empire. But it is evident enough, that this part of his Hiſtory, is devoted as a Shrine to the memory of <hi>Clearchus.</hi> For he would have us believe, that when the Generals were executed, the reſt of them were torn in pieces by Dogs and Birds; but as for the remains of <hi>Clearchus,</hi> that a violent Guſt of Wind, bearing before it a vaſt heap of earth did erect a Hill for a Monument to
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:36410:255"/>
cover his body: In which, after a few Dates had been ſown, in a ſmall time, he ſays, a lovely Grove grew up and ſcatter'd its ſhade all over the place; in ſo much that the King was much concern'd that he had cut off one ſo dear to Heaven, as <hi>Clearchus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paryſatis</hi> therefore having entertain'd an inveterate grudge and emulation againſt <hi>Statira,</hi> and ſeeing that the power ſhe her ſelf had with <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the honour and veneration he had for her, but that her Daughters influence was made ſtrong and unmoveable, by her love and obedience; ſhe was reſolv'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive her ruin, playing at hazard, as ſhe thought, for the greateſt Stake in the world. Among her Maids of Honour, there was one that was truſty, and in the higheſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem with her, whoſe name was <hi>Gigis;</hi> who, as <hi>Dinon</hi> averrs, aſſiſted in making up the poiſon. But <hi>Cteſias</hi> will allow her only to be conſcious of it, and that much againſt her will; expreſly charging <hi>Belita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> for actually poiſoning the Queen, tho' <hi>Dinon</hi> ſays it was one <hi>Melantas.</hi> Now theſe Princeſſes beginning again to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd, and feaſt together, yet by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their former jars and jealouſies, they did not take the ſame meats from the ſame attendants without fear and caution. There is a ſmall <hi>Perſian</hi> Bird, the Guts of which
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:36410:255"/>
are without excrement, and the inſide of it wholly fat; ſo that they ſuppoſe the little Creature lives upon air and dew. It is call'd <hi>Ryntaces. Cteſias</hi> affirms, that <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſatis</hi> dividing this Bird with a knife drencht in poyſon on the one ſide, and free from it on the other, did eat the untoucht and wholſome part her ſelf, and gave <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira</hi> that which was infected. But <hi>Dinon</hi> will not have it to be <hi>Paryſatis,</hi> but <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantas</hi> that cut up the Bird, and preſented the envenom'd part of it to <hi>Statira,</hi> who dying with horrid Agonies and Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was both her ſelf ſenſible of the viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Drug ſhe had taken, and intimated her ſuſpicion of the Queen Mother to the King, who knew her brutiſh fierceneſs, her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable temper. Whereupon, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon a ſpeedy Inqueſt, he ſeized upon his Mothers Purſivants and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Servants that attended at her Table, and put them upon the Rack. <hi>Paryſatis</hi> kept <hi>Gigis</hi> at home with her a long time, and tho' the King commanded her, ſhe would not produce her. But ſhe at laſt deſiring that ſhe might be diſmiſs'd to her own home by night, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it, and ſaying wait for her hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her away, and adjudg'd her to death. Now Poyſoners in <hi>Perſia</hi> ſuffer thus by Law. There is a broad Stone, whereon placing
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:36410:256"/>
the head of them, they do with another daſh preſs it till they have broke both it and the face in pieces, which was the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment <hi>Gigis</hi> loſt her life by. But as for his Mother, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd nor inflicted any other penalty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, ſave that he baniſh'd and confin'd her, not much againſt her will, to <hi>Babylon,</hi> proteſting that whilſt ſhe liv'd he would not come near that mighty City.</p>
            <p>This was the State of the Kings Affairs at home: But he no leſs vigourouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to captivate the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that came along with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> than to conquer him, and keep poſſeſſion of the Empire; and yet could not do it. For when they had loſt their General <hi>Cyrus</hi> and their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commanders, they eſcap'd with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty almoſt out of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Court, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and demonſtrating to all men, that the buſineſs of that Prince and People was to be Rich, Riotous and Effeminate; or elſe to be Pompous and Stately; inſomuch that all <hi>Greece</hi> took courage and diſpiſed thoſe mean Barbarians; eſpecially the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> who thought it ſtrange if they ſhould not now deliver their Country-men, that dwelt in <hi>Aſia</hi> from their Subjection to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> nor put an end to their contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious uſage of them. And firſt having an Army under the conduct of <hi>Thimbron,</hi>
               <pb n="491" facs="tcp:36410:256"/>
then under <hi>Dercylidas;</hi> but doing nothing memorable, they at laſt committed the War to the menage of their King <hi>Ageſilaus.</hi> Who, when he had arriv'd with his Men in Ships at <hi>Aſia,</hi> as ſoon as he had landed them, fell to work, and got himſelf great renown. For he defeated <hi>Tiſaphernes</hi> in a pitcht Battle, and forc'd many Cities to revolt. After theſe great Actions, when <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had wiſely conſider'd, how he might wage War moſt advantageouſly with them, he ſent <hi>Hermocrates</hi> of <hi>Rhodes</hi> into <hi>Greece</hi> with vaſt Treaſures of Gold, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him by a free diſtribution of it to corrupt the leading men in the Cities, and to ſtir up the reſt of the <hi>Grecians</hi> to an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted engagement with <hi>Sparta.</hi> So <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> following his inſtructions, the moſt conſiderable Cities conſpiring againſt it, and all <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> being in an uproar, the <hi>Ephori</hi> remanded <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> from <hi>Aſia.</hi> At which time, they ſay, as he was upon his return, he told his Friends, that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi> had driven him out of <hi>Aſia</hi> with thirty thouſand Archers, the <hi>Perſian</hi> Coyn having an Archer ſtampt upon it. He ſcour'd the Seas too of the <hi>Lacedemonians, Conon</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> and <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> being his Admirals. For <hi>Conon,</hi> after the Sea Fight, in a place, called the <hi>Goats</hi> River, reſided in <hi>Cyprus;</hi> not that he conſulted his
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:36410:257"/>
ſecurity, but looking for a viciſſitude of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs with no leſs hopes than men wait for a low or full tide in the Sea. Who perceiving, that his Stratagems wanted power to actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate them, and that the Kings forces wanted a Wiſe-man to ſteer them, ſent him an account by Letter of his projects, and charged the Bearer to hand it to his Majeſty, if poſſible, by the meditation of <hi>Zeno</hi> a <hi>Cretian,</hi> or <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratus</hi> the <hi>Mendaean,</hi> (the former being a dancing-Maſter, the latter a Phyſitian) or in the abſence of them both by <hi>Cteſias;</hi> who is ſaid to have taken <hi>Conon</hi>'s Letter, and foiſted into the Contents of it a requeſt that his Majeſty would be pleaſed to ſend over <hi>Cteſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> to him, as being a ſerviceable Man in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritine affairs. Yet <hi>Cteſias</hi> is poſitive, That the King of his own accord deputed him to this Province. But <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> geting the better of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> in a Sea-Fight under the Conduct of <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> and <hi>Conon,</hi> after he had ſtript them of their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction by Sea, did at the ſame time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce almoſt all the <hi>Grecians</hi> to their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance; ſo that upon his own terms he made that celebrated Peace with them, which is ſtil'd the Peace of <hi>Antalcidas.</hi> This <hi>Antalcidas</hi> was a <hi>Spartan</hi> the Son of one <hi>Leon,</hi> who ſtickling for the Kings In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, oblig'd the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to let all the <hi>Greek</hi> Cities in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:36410:257"/>
the Iſlands adjacent to it, to become Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and Tributary to him, when this Peace was concluded: If we may give the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable name of Peace to that which was the reproach and ruin of <hi>Greece;</hi> a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which was as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap>glorious to the vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as any War in its iſſue had ever been to them. And therefore <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> though always abominating other <hi>Spartans,</hi> and looking upon them (as <hi>Dinon</hi> ſays) to be the moſt impudent Men living, did yet put a ſtrange value upon <hi>Antalcidas,</hi> when he came to him into <hi>Perſia:</hi> So that one day the King taking a Garland of Flowers, and dipping it in the moſt precious Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſent it to him after Supper, a favour which all were amaz'd at. Indeed he was a perſon fit to be thus delicately treated, and to have ſuch a Crown, who had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Perſians</hi> in his dancing imitated <hi>Leonidas</hi> and <hi>Callicratidas.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> it ſeems, one having ſaid, O ye deplorable Fate of <hi>Greece</hi> now, when the <hi>Spartans</hi> turn <hi>Medes!</hi> Reply'd, nay rather when the <hi>Medes</hi> become <hi>Spartans.</hi> Notwithſtanding the ſubtilty of the Repar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, it did not wipe off the infamy of the Action: But a little after the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> loſt the Principality of their State, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fought unfortunately at <hi>Leuctres;</hi> tho<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their glory was utterly loſt before them in
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:36410:258"/>
that ſcandalous and diſhonourable League. So long indeed as <hi>Sparta</hi> was Empreſs of <hi>Greece, Artaxerxes</hi> did not only entertain <hi>Antalcidas</hi> generouſly, but endear'd him by the name of his Friend. But when routed and humbled at the Battle of <hi>Leuctres,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under great diſtreſſes for money, they had diſpatcht <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talcidas</hi> had addreſs'd himſelf to <hi>Artaxer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes,</hi> beſeeching him to ſupply their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; he ſo deſpis'd, ſlighted, and rejected him, that returning the ſcorn of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and in dread of the States, he pin'd himſelf to death. <hi>Iſmenias</hi> alſo the <hi>Theban</hi> and <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> who got the day at <hi>Leuctres,</hi> arriv'd at the <hi>Perſian</hi> Court; where the latter did nothing unworthy of himſelf. But <hi>Iſmenias</hi> being commanded to do obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to the King, dropt his Ring before him upon the ground, and ſo ſtooping to take it up, he ſeem'd to pay him homage. For ſome ſecret intelligence that pleas'd him he beſtowed upon <hi>Timagoras</hi> the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> ten thouſand Darius's by the hand of his Secretary <hi>Beluris,</hi> and fourſcore Milch Kine were driven after him ſtanding in need of Milk from the Cow, by reaſon of his indiſpoſition. Moreover he ſent him a Bed, Furniture, and Valets, the <hi>Grecians</hi> having not skill enough to make it, as alſo Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to carry him, being infirm in Body,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:36410:258"/>
quite to the Sea ſide. Not to mention the Treat made for him at Court, which was princely and ſplendid: Inſomuch that <hi>Oſtha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> the Kings Brother thus ſpoke to him, Be mindfull of this Table, which is not put before you thus ſpread for nothing. Which was rather a reflection upon his Treaſon, than to remind him of his Brothers boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The <hi>Athenians</hi> therefore condemned <hi>Timagoras</hi> to death for taking Bribes.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> gratify'd the <hi>Grecians</hi> in one thing in lieu of the many wherewith he plagu'd them, and that was by taking off <hi>Tiſaphernes</hi> their moſt hated and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Enemy; whom he put to death, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſatis</hi> adding her charge to thoſe accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were already drawn up againſt him. For the King perſiſted not long in wrath with his Mother, but was reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to her, and ſent for her, being aſſur'd, that ſhe had Wiſdom and Courage fit for an Empire, and there being now no cauſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable, but that they might converſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without ſuſpicion or offence. And from thence forward humouring the King in all things according to his hearts deſire, and by brooking nothing ill which he did, ſhe got a mighty influence upon him, and prevail'd in whatever ſhe requeſted of him. She perceiv'd he was deſperately in love with <hi>Atoſſa,</hi> one of his own Daughters, and
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:36410:259"/>
that he conceal'd and checkt his paſſion chiefly for fear of her ſelf, tho' if we may believe ſome Writers, he had privately enjoy'd the young Princeſs already. Now as ſoon as <hi>Paryſatis</hi> ſuſpected the intrigue, ſhe was more fond of her Grand-daughter than before, and extoll'd both her vertue and beauty to him, as being truly Imperial and Majeſtick. In fine ſhe perſuaded him to marry the Maiden, and to declare her to be his lawfull Wife, in ſpight of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and determinations of the Greek Sages; foraſmuch as ſhe ſaid he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by Providence for a Law to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> and to be the great Arbitrator of good and evil. Some Hiſtorians further affirm (in which number is <hi>Heraclides</hi> the <hi>Cumean)</hi> that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> married not only this one, but his ſecond Daughter <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtris</hi> alſo, of whom we ſhall ſpeak by and by. But he ſo intirely lov'd <hi>Atoſſa</hi> when ſhe became his Conſort, that tho' Leproſie had run through her whole body, he was not in the leaſt offended at it; but putting up his prayers to <hi>Juno</hi> for her, he ador'd her alone among the Deities, being proſtrate upon the earth. His Nobles alſo and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites made ſuch Offerings to that God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs by his direction, that all a long, for about two miles betwixt the Court and her Temple, the road was choaked up with
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:36410:259"/>
Gold and Silver, with purple and Horſes devoted to her. He wag'd War out of his own Kingdom with the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> and <hi>Iphicrates,</hi> but was defeated by reaſon of their diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. So in his expedition againſt the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſians,</hi> he went himſelf in perſon with three hundred Thouſand Footmen, and ten Thouſand Horſe. And making an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion into their Country which was ſcarce, through its roughneſs, paſſable, and withal very miſty, having neither Seed-time nor Harveſt, but with Pears, Apples, and other Tree-fruits breeding up Warlike and valiant men; he unawares fell into great diſtreſſes and dangers. For there was nothing to be got, fit for his men to eat, of the growth of that place, nor to be imported from any other. He would only have beaſts for burthen ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, inſomuch that the head of an Aſs was ſold for near forty ſhillings. In ſhort the King himſelf was at a loſs for proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and there were but few horſes left, the reſt they had ſpent for food. Then <hi>Tiribazus,</hi> a man for his Valour often in great favour with his Prince, and as often for his buffoonery quite out of it, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly at that time being low and deſpicable did yet preſerve the King and his Army. There being two Kings amongſt the <hi>Cadu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
               <pb n="498" facs="tcp:36410:260"/>
and both of them encamping ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately after he had made his application to <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and imparted his deſign to him, he went to one of the Princes, and ſent away his Son privately to the other. So each of them deceived his man, aſſuring him that the other Prince had deputed an Embaſſador to <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for friendſhip and alliance with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; and therefore if he were wiſe he told him he muſt apply himſelf to his Maſter before he had decreed any thing, and that he would lend him his aſſiſtance in all things. Both of them gave credit to theſe Words, and becauſe they ſuppos'd there was a mutual grudge betwixt them, the one diſpatcht away Envoys along with <hi>Tiribazus,</hi> the other with his Son. But <hi>Tiribazus</hi> ſtaying ſomewhat long, the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and accuſations of his Enemies made an impreſſion upon <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> Who was very Melancholick, and being ſorry that he had confided in <hi>Tiribazus,</hi> gave ear to his Rivals who impeacht him. But at laſt he came, and ſo did his Son, both of them bringing the <hi>Caduſian</hi> Agents along with them, and ſo there was a League and Peace ſign'd with both the Princes. And now <hi>Tiribazus,</hi> being great and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, return'd with the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarch, who plainly prov'd that cowardice and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminacy
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:36410:260"/>
are the effects of a baſe dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Nature, guided by erroneous noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not of niceneſs and ſuperfluous exceſſes as moſt men ſuppoſe. For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Jewels of Gold, his Robe of State, and the reſt of his coſtly attire, worth no leſs than twelve thouſand Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, with which he was conſtantly clad, his labours and toils were no leſs than thoſe of the meaneſt perſons in his Army. Nay turning up his Horſe with his Quiver by his ſide, and his Shield on his Arm he led them through craggy and ſteep ways, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the other Souldiers obſerving his cheerfulneſs, and unwearied ſtrength took wing, and went the more ſwiftly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him: Whoſe daily march was above two hundred furlongs. After he had arriv'd at one of his own Manſions, which had lovely Parks nobly kept in order though ſituated in a Region naked and without Trees; the weather being very cold he gave full Commiſſion to his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to provide themſelves with wood by cutting down any without exception even the Pine and Cypreſs. When they were at a ſtand, and for ſparing them, being large and goodly Trees, he, taking up an Ax himſelf, fell the greateſt and faireſt of them. After which his men us'd their hatchets, and piling up many Fires, paſt
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:36410:261"/>
away the Night with eaſe: Nevertheleſs he returned not without the loſs of many and valiant Subjects, and of almoſt all his Horſes. Wherefore having imagined that he ſhould grow little in the eyes of his people through the misfortune and ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this expedition, he ſuſpected that he was deſpis'd by ſome of his Nobles, many of whom he ſlew in his rage, and yet ſtill was jealous of more. For fear is the bloodieſt paſſion in Princes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the bold and couragious amongſt them are merciful, gentle, and confiding. And thus the timerous and ſluggiſh brutes are ever untractable and the moſt unruly; whilſt the Nobler being made confident by their ſpirit refufe not the acquaintance of their owners. In proceſs of time after <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes,</hi> being very old, perceiv'd that his Sons were in controverſie about his Kingdom, and that they made parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Favourites and Peers. Thoſe that were equitable among them thought it fit that as he had receiv'd it, ſo he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath it to <hi>Darius</hi> whoſe juſt inheritance it was. The younger Brother <hi>Ochus,</hi> who was hot and violent, had indeed a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable number of the Courtiers that eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his intereſt, but his chief hope was that by <hi>Atoſſa</hi>'s means he ſhould prepare his Father. For he had ſmooth'd her up
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:36410:261"/>
with the thoughts of being his Wife, and Queen, after the death of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> And truly it was buzz'd abroad that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it <hi>Ochus</hi> maintain'd too great correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with her, but ſecret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the King: Who being willing timely to daſh his Son <hi>Ochus</hi>'s hopes, leſt he attempting the very ſame things his Uncle <hi>Cyrus</hi> did, Wars and Contentions might again afflict his Kingdom, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed <hi>Darius,</hi> then fifty years old, his Succeſſor, and gave him leave to wear the Imperial Hat cockt up. It is a Rule and uſage of <hi>Perſia,</hi> that the Heir appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the Crown ſhould beg a boon, and that he that declared him ſo ſhould give whatever he askt, provided it were within the Sphere of his power. <hi>Darius</hi> therefore requeſted <hi>Aſpaſia,</hi> the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly beloved Miſs of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> but then the Kings Concubine, ſhe was originally a <hi>Phocian</hi> born in the Country of <hi>Ionia,</hi> of gentile Parents, and well educated. Once when <hi>Cyrus</hi> was at Supper, ſhe was led into him with other Women, who when they were ſat down by him, though he ſported and dallied and talked wantonly with them, did without ſhyneſs admit that his fulſome Courtſhip; but ſhe ſtood by the Table, with a graceful ſilence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to come to him when <hi>Cyrus</hi> call'd
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:36410:262"/>
her. And when his Chamberlains were going to force her towards him, ſhe ſaid, <hi>whoſoever lays hands on me ſhall rue it,</hi> ſo ſhe ſeem'd to the company a ſullen, rude country thing. However <hi>Cyrus</hi> being well pleas'd with her reſerv'd humour laugh'd it off, and ſaid to the Man that brought the Woman, doſt not thou plainly ſee that this Woman alone of all that came with thee is truly Noble, and of an impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Chaſtity? After which time he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to regard her, and lov'd her above all of her Sex, and call'd her <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> the Wiſe. But <hi>Cyrus</hi> being ſlain in the fight ſhe was taken among the ſpoils of his Camp, whom when <hi>Darius</hi> did demand, no doubt he much offended his Father. For the Barbarous people keep a very jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and watchful Eye over their Carnal pleaſures; ſo that 'tis death for a Man not only to come near and careſs any Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine of his Prince, but likewiſe in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to make an excurſion, or paſs over to the Coaches in which they are carried. And though to gratify his Luſt, he had againſt all Law marry'd his Daughter <hi>Atoſſa,</hi> and had beſide her a Seraglio of three hundred and ſixty the moſt exquiſite beauties in his Dominions; yet being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portun'd for that one by <hi>Darius,</hi> he urg'd that ſhe was a free-woman, and allow'd
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:36410:262"/>
him to take her if ſhe had an inclination to go with him, but by no means to force her away againſt it. <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> therefore being ſent for, and contrary to the King's expectation, making choice of <hi>Darius,</hi> he gave him her indeed, being conſtrain'd by Law, but when he had done ſo, a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he took her from him. For he conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated her Prieſteſs to <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Ecbatane;</hi> whom there they name <hi>Anitis,</hi> that ſhe might ſpend the remainder of her days in a ſtrict Chaſtity, thinking thus to puniſh his Son, not with rigour but moderation, by a revenge checquer'd with jeſt and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. But he took it heinouſly, either he was a paſſionate admirer of <hi>Aſpaſia,</hi> or becauſe he lookt upon himſelf as highly affronted and ſcorn'd by his Father. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribazus</hi> perceiving him thus divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Luſt and rage did exaſperate him yet farther after he had obſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rv'd in his injuries a repreſentation of his own. Of which take the following account: <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> having many Daughters promis'd to give <hi>Apama</hi> to <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> to Wife, <hi>Rodogeune</hi> to <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes,</hi> and <hi>Ameſtris</hi> to <hi>Tiribazus;</hi> whom alone he diſappointed by marrying <hi>Ameſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris</hi> himſelf, and yet was juſt to the other two. However to make him amends he betroth'd his youngeſt Daughter <hi>Atoſſa</hi> to him. But after he had, being enamour'd
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:36410:263"/>
of, marry'd her too, (as has been ſaid.) <hi>Tiribazus</hi> had an irreconciliable grudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, who was ſeldom at any other time ſteady in his temper, but uneven and inconſiderate. Wherefore whether he were in the number of the choiceſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites of his Prince, or whether he were offenſive and odious to him; he demean'd himſelf in neither condition with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: But being advanc'd, he was intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably inſolent, and in his degradation his deportment was not ſubmiſſive and peaceable, but fierce and haughty. And therefore <hi>Tiribazus</hi> was to the young Prince as Oyl thrown upon a flame, ever urging him, and ſaying that in vain thoſe wear their Hats upright, who conſult not the Succeſs of their affairs, and that he was ill befriended of reaſon if he imagin'd (whilſt he had a Brother, who that he might have his choice of Women endeavour'd to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine him, and a Father of ſo raſh and fickle a humour) that he ſhould by ſuceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion inſallibly ſtep up into the Throne. For he that out of fondneſs to a lewd <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> female hath eluded a Law Sacred and inviolable among the <hi>Perſians,</hi> is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be faithful in the performance of the moſt important promiſes. He added too that it was not all one for <hi>Ochus</hi> not to attain to, and for him to be put by his
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:36410:263"/>
Crown; ſince <hi>Ochus</hi> as a Subject might live happily, and no body could hinder him, but he being proclaim'd King, muſt either take up the Scepter, or lay down his Life. Theſe words preſently inflam'd <hi>Darius.</hi> That of <hi>Sophocles</hi> perhaps being generally true,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ill Councel ſoon is at its Journeys End;</hi> For the path is ſmooth, or upon an eaſie deſcent, that leads us to what we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd, and for the moſt part of us are propenſe to Vice through our ſtrangeneſs too, and ignorance of the lovelineſs of Vertue. And no doubt the greatneſs of the Empire, and the jealouſie <hi>Darius</hi> had of <hi>Ochus</hi> furniſht <hi>Tiribazus</hi> with materials for his remonſtrance. Nor was <hi>Venus</hi> wholly unconcern'd in the matter upon the loſs of her Votary <hi>Aſpaſia: Darius</hi> therefore reſign'd himſelf up to the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of <hi>Tiribazus,</hi> and many now conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with them, an <hi>Eunuch</hi> detected their Plot to the King, and the way how it was to be managed, being very well informed that the Traitors had reſolved to break into his Bed-Chamber by night, and there to kill him as he lay. After <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi> had been thus advertiſed, he did not think fit by diſregarding the diſcovery to deſpiſe ſo great a danger, nor to believe it when there was little or no proof of it.
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:36410:264"/>
Thus then he did; He charged the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> conſtantly to be amongſt and accompany the Conſpirators wherever they were. In the mean while he broke down the Wall of the Chamber behind his Bed, and when he had made a door, he hid it with Tapeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. So the hour approaching, and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> having told him the very nick of time in which the Traytors deſign'd to aſſaſſinate him, he waited for them in his Bed, and roſe not up, till he had ſeen the faces of his aggreſſors, and accurately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd every man of them. But as ſoon as he ſaw them with their Swords drawn, and coming up to him, throwing up the hanging he made his retreat into an inner Chamber, and bolting to the door he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd the Court. Thus when the <hi>Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had been ſeen by him, and had attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him in vain; they with ſpeed went back through the ſame doors they came, enjoyning <hi>Tiribazus</hi> eſpecially and thoſe near him to retire, becauſe clearly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. They therefore made their eſcape different ways, but <hi>Tiribazus</hi> as they were laying hold on him ſlew many of the Kings Guards, and at length being ſtruck through with a Dart at a diſtance, he fell. And as for <hi>Darius</hi> who was brought to the Bar with his Children, the King appointed Princely Judges to ſit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:36410:264"/>
him, who becauſe he was not himſelf at the Trial, but accus'd <hi>Darius</hi> for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xy, commanded his Notaries to write down the opinion of every one of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and ſhew it to him. In ſhort after they had reſolv'd all as one man, and ſentenc'd <hi>Darius</hi> to death, the Officers ſeiz'd on him, and hurryed him to a priſon not far off. To which place the Executioner, when ſummoned came with a razour in his hand, with which men of his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cut off the heads of high offenders. But when he ſaw that <hi>Darius</hi> was the perſon thus to be puniſhed, he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall'd, and ſtarted back, offering to go out, as one that had neither power nor courage enough to behead him, who a little before had been proclaim'd King, yet at the threats and commands of the Judges who ſtood at the Priſon-door he return'd, and graſping the hair of his head, and binding his face to the ground with one hand, he cut off his neck with the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zour he had in the other. Some affirms that ſentence was paſs'd in the preſence of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes;</hi> that <hi>Darius</hi> after he had been convicted by clear evidence, falling pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate before him, did humbly beg his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; that inſtead of giving it he riſing up in rage, and drawing his Scymeter ſmote him till he had kill'd him; that then lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:36410:265"/>
them to his Palace he did Worſhip the Sun, and ſaid, <hi>Be gone in Triumph, O ye</hi> Perſians <hi>and declare to your fellow Snbjects how the mighty</hi> Oramazes <hi>hath dealt out vengeance to the contrivers of unjuſt and unlawfull things.</hi> Such then was the iſſue of this Conſpiracy. And now <hi>Ochus</hi> was big with expectation, being puff'd up with the intereſt he had in <hi>Atoſſa;</hi> but yet was afraid of <hi>Ariaſpes</hi> the only Male ſurviving beſide himſelf of the Legitimate off-ſpring of his Father, and of <hi>Arſames</hi> one of his natural Sons. For indeed <hi>Ariaſpes</hi> was already declar'd Prince by the wiſhes of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> not becauſe he was the elder Brother, but becauſe he excell'd <hi>Ochus</hi> in gentleneſs, plain dealing, and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; whereas <hi>Arſames</hi> appear'd by his Wiſdom accompliſh'd for the Throne, and that he was moſt dear to his Eather, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> very well knew. So he laid Snares for them both, and being no leſs treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than bloody, he made uſe of the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of his nature againſt <hi>Arſames,</hi> and of his craft, his willingneſs againſt <hi>Ariaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes.</hi> For he ſuborn'd the Kings Eunuchs and Favourites to convey to him mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and harſh expreſſions from his Father, as though he had decreed to put him to a cruel and ignominious death. When they ſeem'd daily to communicate theſe things
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:36410:265"/>
as ſecrets, and ſaid one while that the King would do this to him ere long, at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within a few moments; they ſo aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd the good Prince, they ſtruck ſuch a terrour into him, and caſt ſuch a confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and anxiety upon his thoughts, that having prepared ſome fatal drugs he drank them, that he might be deliver'd from his hated Life. The King knowing what kind of death he died, heartily lamented him, and gave a ſhrewd gueſs at the impulſive cauſe of it. But being diſabled by his age to ſearch into and prove it, he was after the loſs of his Son more indulgent to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſames,</hi> did manifeſtly place his greateſt confidence in him, and made him privy to all his deſigns. Whereupon <hi>Ochus</hi> had no longer patience to defer the execution of his purpoſe, but having procured <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaces, Tiribazus</hi>'s Son for the undertaking, he kill'd <hi>Arſames</hi> by his hand. <hi>Artaxer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes</hi> at that time had but a little while to live by reaſon of his very old age. So when he heard of the Fate of <hi>Arſames,</hi> he could not at all bear it, but ſtraight ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the load of his grief expired, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had enjoyed life ninety four years, and an Empire ſixty two. And then he ſeem'd a moderate and gracious Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, eſpecially if compar'd to his Son <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> who outdid all his Predeceſſors in blood and Cruelty.</p>

For as <hi>Hyppomachus</hi> the Wreſtler affirm'd, he could by their port diſtinguiſh his Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars at great diſtance, tho' they were but carrying meat from the Shambles; So it is very probable, that the ingenious ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of thoſe who have had good Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation doe alike influence their Actions, and create in them a gentile Demeanour, very agreable and becoming.</p>

through many riſques ond difficulties they aimed at.

<pb n="518" facs="tcp:36410:271"/>
Now, when <hi>Dionyſius</hi> was ſick, and like to die, <hi>Dion</hi> endeavour'd to diſcourſe with him in behalf of the Children he had by <hi>Ariſtomache;</hi> but was ſtill prevented by the Phiſitians, deſigning thereby to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate themſelves with the next Succeſſor, who alſo, as <hi>Timaeus</hi> reports, gave him, as he deſired, a ſleeping Potion, which ſoon depriv'd him of his Senſes, and made <note place="margin">His Death.</note> him ſleep his laſt.</p>

But that which ſtartled them moſt, was the Propoſal he made to avert the imminent danger they feared of a War with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> undertaking to ſail immediately over into <hi>Africk,</hi> and if the King deſired it, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Peace upon honourable terms; but if he rather inclined to War, that he would fit out and maintain at his own proper coſt and charges fifty Galleys, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for the Service. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> admired his Gallantry, and received the frankneſs of
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:36410:271"/>
his Offer with great ſatisfaction. But the other Courtiers, thinking this his Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity reflected upon them, and jealous of being leſſened by his growing greatneſs, from hence took all occaſions by private inſinuations and ſlanders to render him obnoxious to the Kings diſpleaſure; as if he deſigned by his Power at Sea to ſurprize the Government, and by the help of thoſe Naval Forces confer the ſupreme Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon his Siſter <hi>Ariſtomache</hi>'s Children. But indeed the moſt apparent and prime Cauſe of their invidious and malicious proceedings againſt him, was his reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Converſation, and Singularity in his way of Living; for they who had from the beginning by flatteries and all unworthy artifices inſinuated themſelves into the favour and familiarity of the Prince, youthful and voluptuouſly bred, were wholly ſubſervient to his Pleaſures, and ſought how to entertain him daily with new Amours, and ſuch idle and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Employs, as Wine, Women, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lewd Diverſions: By which means the Tyranny, like Iron ſoftned in the fire, ſeemed to the Subject to be more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and gentle, and to abate ſomewhat of its extreme ſeverity; the edge thereof being blunted, not by the Clemency, but rather the ſloth and degeneracy of the
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:36410:272"/>
young King; whoſe diſſoluteneſs gaining ground daily, and growing upon him, ſoon weakned and broke thoſe Adaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Chains, with which his Father <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery.</note> ſaid he had left the Monarchy faſtned and ſecured. 'Tis reported of him, that having begun a drunken Debauch, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued it ninety days without intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in all which time no grave Man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, or ſerious Diſcourſe was heard at Court, but Drinking, Singing, Dancing, Buffoonry, and all ſorts of licentious Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery reigned there without controul. 'Tis likely then they had little kindneſs for <hi>Dion,</hi> who never indulged himſelf in ſuch Diverſions and Youthful Frolicks; for which reaſon they made his very Vertues the ſubject of their Calumnies, and nick-named whatever was remarkable in him, <hi>Vice:</hi> They called his Gravity Pride, his Plain-dealing Obſtinacy, the good advice he gave was all conſtrued Reprimand, and he was cenſured for neglecting and ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe whom he would not accompany in their Miſdeameanours. And to ſay the truth, he was naturally of a haughty Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, auſtere, reſerved, and unſociable <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dion</hi>'s haughty Humour.</note> in Converſation, which made his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unpleaſant and diſagreeable, not only to the young King, who delighted in none but his ſmooth-tongued Courtiers
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:36410:272"/>
and Paraſites, but many alſo of <hi>Dion</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Friends, tho' they well approved the Integrity and Generoſity of his temper, yet juſtly blamed his ſurly Carriage, as ſavouring too much of an uncouth and ſtarched humour, and wanting ſomething of Addreſs and due Civility in the recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe that applyed themſelves to him; of which <hi>Plato</hi> afterwards wrote to him, and (as it were) Prophetically ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him carefully to avoid a ſurly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, unleſs he intended to be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by all Society, and live alone by himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now, tho' <hi>Dion,</hi> by reaſon of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of Affairs, was very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and in great eſteem, as being the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtay and prop of the Government, which was in a tottering and unſafe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet he well underſtood that he ow'd not his Greatneſs to the Kings kindneſs, but to the neceſſity of his concerns; and ſuppoſing the prime cauſe of this to be his Ignorance, and want of Education, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to induce him into a courſe of ingenious Studies, and acquaint him with the Precepts of Morality; thereby hoping to take off the averſion he had to Vertue, and by degrees inure him to a complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in performing good and laudable Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> in his own Nature was

not the worſt of Princes, but his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fearing that if he ſhould come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <note place="margin">His Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> himſelf better, and converſe with wiſe and learned Men, he might complot againſt him, and diſpoſſeſs him of his Kingdom, kept him in a cloſe confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Lodgings; where for want of other Company, and ignorant how to ſpend his time better, he buſied himſelf in making little Chariots, Candleſticks, Joynt-ſtools, Tables, and the like wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Implements. For his Father, <hi>Dionyſius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the firſt very timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</note> the Firſt, was ſo diffident and ſuſpicious of all mankind, and withal ſo wretchedly fearful, that he would not ſuffer a Barber to trim him with Razour or Sciſſers, but made one of his Artificers with a live Coal ſear off his excreſcent hairs. Neither were his Brother or his Son allowed to come into his Appartment in the Habit they wore, but they, as all others, were ſtrip'd to their skins by ſome of the Guard, and put on other Cloathes before they were admitted into the Preſence. When on a time his Brother <hi>Leptimes</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing the ſituation of a place, and took a Javelin from one of the Guard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Plot, he was highly incenſed at him, and cauſed the Soldier that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him the Weapon to be put to death. He declared, the more judicious his Friends
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:36410:273"/>
were, the more he ſuſpected them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew that were it in their choice, they would rather Command, than be ſubject to a Superiour. He flew <hi>Marſyas,</hi> one of his Captains, whom he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to a conſiderable command, for dreaming that he killed him; ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that it was not a roving Fancy, but a previous thought, and reſolved deſign which had formed that Idea in his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; ſo timorous was he, ſo miſerable a Slave to his fear, yet very angry with <hi>Plato,</hi> becauſe he would not allow him to be the valianteſt Man alive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dion</hi> (as we ſaid before) ſeeing <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> the Son defective in his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and irregular in his Manners, for want of good Education, adviſed him to ſet to Study; perſuading him earneſtly to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dion</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyſius</hi> to ſend for <hi>Plato.</hi>
                  </note> entreat <hi>Plato,</hi> the greateſt Philoſopher in the World, to come into <hi>Sicily;</hi> and when he came, to permit himſelf to his direction and advice, by whoſe inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he might learn to lead a vertuous life, and be conformable to the glorious Idea of that Divine Eſſence, whoſe wiſe Conduct all things obey, and out of confuſion form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the beautiful Order of the Univerſe; by which means he would procure great happineſs to himſelf and all his Subjects, who obliged by his Juſtice and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:36410:274"/>
would then willingly pay him Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as their Father, which now grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and upon neceſſity they are forced to yield him, as their Lord. For Fear and Force, a great Navy and ſtanding Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of ten thouſand Mercenary Soldiers, are not (as his Father ſaid) the Adaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Chains which ſecure the Regal Power, but the love and affection of Subjects to their Prince, endeared to him by his Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and Juſtice; which tho' they ſeem more pliant than the ſtiff and hard bonds of Severity, are nevertheleſs the ſtrongeſt and moſt durable Tyes to fix and eſtabliſh a ſettled and laſting Empire: Moreover, it is mean and diſhonourable that a Prince, glorious in his Equipage, ſplendid in the Gallantry and Magnificence of his Court, ſhould not at all excell a Peaſant in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and Converſation, nor have his princely Mind accompliſhed, as well as Body adorned, according to his Royal Dignity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dion</hi> frequently entertaining the King upon this Subject, and as occaſion offered, repeating ſome of the Philoſophers Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Arguments, <hi>Dionyſius</hi> grew impatient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſirous to have <hi>Plato</hi>'s Company, and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plato</hi> ſent for.</note> to hear him diſcourſe: Forthwith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſent divers Letters to him to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> to which <hi>Dion</hi> added his entreaties;
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:36410:274"/>
alſo ſeveral Philoſophers of the <hi>Pythagore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Sect from <hi>Italy,</hi> perſwaded him to come and manage the plyable Youth of the King, and by his grave and ſerious Advice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the unſtable and deſultory efforts of his new-acquired Power and Grandeur. <hi>Plato</hi> (as he ſays of himſelf) being aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſeem buſie only in words, and ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Action, hoping withal that if he could work a Cure upon one Man, the Head and Guide of the reſt, he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy the Diſtempers of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Sicily,</hi> yielded to their Requeſts.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Dion</hi>'s Enemies fearing an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> perſwaded him to recall from Baniſhment one <hi>Philiſtus,</hi> a Learned <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Philiſtus</hi> the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.</note> Man, and very skilful in Tyrannical Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, whom they deſigned to ſet in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Plato</hi> and his Philoſophy. For <hi>Philiſtus</hi> from the beginning was a great inſtrument to promote the Tyranny, and being Governour of the Caſtle, kept it a long time for that Faction. There was a report that he had to do with the Mother of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Firſt; and that he was not altogether ignorant of it. But <hi>Lepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi> having two Daughters by a married Woman whom he had Debauched, gave one of them in marriage to <hi>Philiſtus</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out acquainting the King, who being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, put <hi>Leptimes</hi>'s Miſtreſs in Priſon,

and Baniſhed <hi>Philiſtus</hi> the Kingdom: <note place="margin">Why ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd.</note> Whereupon he fled to ſome of his Friends at <hi>Adria,</hi> in which retirement and leiſure 'tis probable he writ the greateſt part of his Hiſtory; for he returned not into his Country during the Reign of that <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But after his Death, as is before related, <note place="margin">Recalled from Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</note> 
                  <hi>Dion</hi>'s Enemies occaſioned him to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called Home, as fitter for their purpoſe, and a firm Friend to the Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he immediately upon his return endeavoured to abett; and at the ſame time divers Calumnies and Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt <hi>Dion</hi> were by others brought to the King; as that he held Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with <hi>Theodotes</hi> and <hi>Heraclides,</hi> to ſubvert the Monarchy: for indeed 'tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he had hopes by the coming of <hi>Plato</hi> to take off the unlimitted Power of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> and make him more moderate and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in his Authority; but if he continued averſe to that, and were not to be reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he reſolved to depoſe him, and reſtore the Common-wealth to the <hi>Syracuſians;</hi> not that he approved a Democracy or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Government, but thought it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrable to a Tyranny, when a good Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracy, or Regency of the Grandees, could not be procured.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="527" facs="tcp:36410:275"/>
This was the ſtate of Affairs when <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Plato <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives in</hi> Sicily.</note> came into <hi>Sicily,</hi> who at his firſt arrival was received with wonderful demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Kindneſs and Reſpect; for one of the Kings richeſt Chariots waited upon him when he came on ſhore. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> himſelf ſacrificed to the Gods, in thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgment for the great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which had befel his Kingdom: The Citizens alſo entertained marvellous hopes of a ſpeedy and thorough Reformation. For that at Court they obſerved a modeſt <hi>Decorum</hi> in their Feaſtings, a grave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure in their Behaviour, and the King himſelf returned kind and obliging An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to all Petitions and Cauſes that came before him. Men were generally grown very deſirous of Learning, and eagerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon the ſtudy of Philoſophy; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that the very Palace, as 'tis repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was covered with duſt by the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Concourſe of the Students in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks, that reſorted thither.</p>
               <p>Not long after, at a Solemn Sacrifice in the Caſtle, according to the Cuſtom of the Country, when the Prieſt, as he was wont, prayed for the long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the preſent Government: <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> ſtanding by, was heard to ſay, What, will you never leave off curſing me? This ſenſibly vext <hi>Philiſtus</hi> and his Party, who
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:36410:276"/>
conjectured, that if <hi>Plato</hi> by ſo little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, had thus transformed and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the young King's mind, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by longer converſe, and greater inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, he would get ſuch Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that it would be impoſſible to withſtand him. They did therefore no <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dion</hi> rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at by the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.</note> longer privately, and apart, but joyntly, and in publick all of them rail at <hi>Dion,</hi> noiſing it about, that he manifeſtly charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and bewitched <hi>Dionyſius</hi> by <hi>Plato</hi>'s So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry; to the end, that when he was perſuaded voluntarily to part with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, and throw off his Authority, <hi>Dion</hi> might take it up, and ſettle it upon his Siſter <hi>Ariſtomache</hi>'s Children. Others ſeemed to take it in great ſcorn, that the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who formerly arrived in <hi>Sicily</hi> with a great Fleet, and numerous Land-Army, but were routed and beaten off with great loſs, without being able ſo much as to take the City of <hi>Syracuſe;</hi> ſhould now by means of one Sophiſter, overturn the whole Empire of <hi>Dionyſius;</hi> inveagling him to caſhier his Guard of ten thouſand Lances, diſmiſs a Navy of four hundred Galleys, disband an Army of ten thouſand Horſe, and treble the number of Foot, and go ſeek in the Schools an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and imaginary Bliſs, and learn by the Mathematicks how to be happy;
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:36410:276"/>
while in the mean time he reſigned the ſubſtantial enjoyments of abſolute Power, Riches, and Pleaſure of <hi>Dion</hi> and his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Children.</p>
               <p>By theſe means at firſt <hi>Dion</hi> incurred <note place="margin">Out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at Court.</note> the Kings ſuſpicion, and by degrees his apparent diſpleaſure and averſion. A Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alſo was intercepted, which <hi>Dion</hi> had writ to the <hi>Carthaginian</hi>'s agents, adviſing them, that when they treated with <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius</hi> concerning a Peace, they ſhould not come to their Audience, unleſs he were there; and then he would effectually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch their buſineſs according to their minds. When <hi>Dionyſius</hi> had ſhewed this to <hi>Philiſtus,</hi> and as <hi>Timaeus</hi> relates, conſulted with him about it, he over-reached <hi>Dion</hi> by a feigned reconciliation, fairly pretending to receive him again to his favour; but lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him alone one day to the Sea-ſide, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Caſtle Wall, he ſhewed him the Letter, and taxed him with Conſpiring with the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> againſt him; when <hi>Dion</hi> aſſayed to offer ſomething in his own defence, <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſuffered him not; but immediately forced him aboard a Veſſel, which lay there for that purpoſe, <note place="margin">Is forced away into <hi>Italy.</hi>

               <p>When this was publickly known, all Men thought it very hard uſage, and a

               <p>
                  <hi>Dion</hi> was very Rich, and little inferiour to the King himſelf in the Splendor and <note place="margin">His Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</note> Furniture of his Houſe; which his Friends packt up and conveyed to him: beſides many Rich Preſents, which were ſent him by the Ladies and others of his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

and now an Exile, ſet out the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and Power of his Lord the King.</p>
               <p>Upon this, <hi>Dionyſius</hi> immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved <hi>Plato</hi> into the Caſtle, deſigning under colour of an honourable and kind Reception, to ſet a Guard upon him, leſt he ſhould follow <hi>Dion,</hi> and declare to the World in his behalf, how injuriouſly he had been dealt with. And now time and Converſation (as Wild Beaſts by uſe grow tame and tractable) brought <hi>Dionyſius</hi> to endure <hi>Plato</hi>'s Company and Diſcourſe; ſo that he began to love the Philoſopher, but with ſuch an Affection, as had ſomething of the Tyrant in it, requiring of <hi>Plato,</hi> that he ſhould, in return of his kindneſs, love him only, and admire him above all other Men; being ready to permit to his care the chief management of Affairs, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Government too, upon Condition that he would not prefer <hi>Dion</hi>'s Friendſhip before his. This extravagant Affection was a great trouble to <hi>Plato;</hi> for it was accompanyed with petulant and jealous Humours, like the fond Paſſions of thoſe that are deſperately in Love; frequently falling out with him, and preſently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating to be friends again; for now he was beyond meaſure deſirous to be <hi>Plato</hi>'s Scholar, and to proceed in the Study of Philoſophy: yet he ſeemed ſtill to have
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:36410:278"/>
ſome regret, and to be aſhamed of himſelf to thoſe that endeavoured to pervert him from this deſign, as if he were grown de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and like to be ſpoiled and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>
               <p>But a War about this time breaking <note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Dion</hi> ſojourned in the City with <hi>Calip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> one of his Acquaintance; but for <note place="margin">Dion <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journs at</hi> Athens.</note> his diverſion, he bought a Seat in the Country, which afterwards, when he went into <hi>Sicily,</hi> he gave to <hi>Speucippus,</hi> the moſt familiar Companion he had of all his Friends at <hi>Athens; Plato</hi> deſigning by his pleaſant Converſation, full of ſeaſonable and witty Mirth, to ſweeten and divert <hi>Dion</hi>'s auſtere and melancholy Temper; for <hi>Speucippus</hi> was a very ingenious and
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:36410:278"/>
merry Droll, as <hi>Timon,</hi> in his Satyrs, calls him.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Plato</hi> intending to exhibit a Play <note place="margin">Exhibits a Play for the Youth.</note> for the Youth, <hi>Dion</hi> took upon him the ordering and management thereof, and defrayed the whole Expence at his own Charge; <hi>Plato</hi> giving him this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to oblige the <hi>Athenians,</hi> which was like to procure his Friend more kindneſs than himſelf Credit. <hi>Dion</hi> went alſo to ſee ſeveral other Cities, and was entertain'd <note place="margin">Travels in <hi>Greece.</hi>

               <p>It is reported, that <hi>Dion,</hi> upon an Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, went to the Houſe of <hi>Pteodorus,</hi> the <hi>Megarenſian,</hi> who was a very Potent

and Wealthy Man; and when by reaſon of the great concourſe of People about his Doors, who waited the diſpatch of Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his acceſs was troubleſome and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, turning about to his Friends, who ſeemed concerned and angry at it, What reaſon, ſaid he, have we to blame <hi>Pteodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> who our ſelves uſed our Viſitants no better when we were at <hi>Syracuſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after, <hi>Dionyſius</hi> envying <hi>Dion,</hi> and withal jealous of the favour and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt <note place="margin">His Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues ſtopt.</note> he had among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> put a ſtop upon his Incomes, and no longer ſent him his Revenues; making his own Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners Truſtees of the Eſtate; but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to obviate the ill will and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, which upon <hi>Plato</hi>'s account might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to him among the Philoſophers, he got into his Court many that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Learned Men; and ambitiouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to ſurpaſs them all in their Debates, he was forced to make uſe of (tho' ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times impertinently) what he had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally learnt of <hi>Plato,</hi> and now wiſhed for his Company again, repenting he had not made better uſe of it when he had it, and given no greater heed to his excellent Precepts and Diſcourſes: Like a Tyrant therefore, inconſiderate in his Deſires, heady and violent in his Paſſions; on a ſudden he was eagerly bent on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſign
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:36410:279"/>
of recalling him, and left no ſtone unturned, but prevailed with <hi>Archytas</hi> the <hi>Pythagorean,</hi> by whoſe means he firſt became acquainted and familiar with <hi>Plato,</hi> to ſtand obliged for the performances of his Promiſes, and to perſwade him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>Sicily.</hi>

<pb n="536" facs="tcp:36410:280"/>
unbefriended by the Ladies, who upon all occaſions ſtudied to oblige him; but he had from <hi>Dionyſius</hi> that peculiar Credit, which no man elſe ever obtained, to that degree of confiding, that he might come into his Preſence without being examined or ſearched. When the King offered him a very conſiderable ſum of Money, and repeated the tender of his Bounty; but <hi>Plato</hi> ſtill refuſed to accept it, <hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> the <hi>Cyrenian,</hi> then preſent, ſaid, That <hi>Dionyſius</hi> was liberal without danger of hurting his Treaſury; for to thoſe that wanted much he gave very little, and a great deal to <hi>Plato,</hi> who received nothing.</p>
               <p>After the firſt Complements of kindneſs were over, when <hi>Plato</hi> began to diſcourſe of <hi>Dion,</hi> he was at firſt diverted by dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Excuſes, which ſoon after begat feuds and diſguſts, tho' as yet not publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken notice of; <hi>Dionyſius</hi> endeavouring all he could to conceal them; and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Civilities and Honourable uſage, to draw him off from his Kindneſs to <hi>Dion: Plato,</hi> for ſome time, did not divulge this his perfidious dealing, and breach of promiſe, but bore with it, and diſſembled his reſcent: While matters ſtood thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, and as they thought, they were unobſerved, and undiſcovered, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon</hi> the <hi>Cyzicinian,</hi> one of <hi>Plato</hi>'s follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:36410:280"/>
foretold an Eclipſe of the Sun, which happened according to his Prediction: for which he was much admired by the King, and rewarded with a Talent of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> drolling with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Philoſophers, told them, he alſo had ſomething extraordinary to Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticate; which they entreating him to declare, <hi>I fore-tell,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that</hi> Dionyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us <hi>and</hi> Plato <hi>will in a very little time fall out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At length, <hi>Dionyſius</hi> made Sale of <hi>Dion</hi>'s Eſtate, converted the Money to his own uſe, and removed <hi>Plato</hi> from an Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had in the Gardens of the Palace, to Lodgings near thoſe of the Guards he kept in Pay, who bore <hi>Plato</hi> an old grudge, and ſought Opportunity to make him away; ſupppoſing he adviſed <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> to lay down the Government, and disband his Soldiers. When <hi>Archytas</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the danger <hi>Plato</hi> was in, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent a Galley with Meſſengers to demand him of <hi>Dionyſius;</hi> alledging, that he ſtood engaged for his ſafety, upon the confidence of which, <hi>Plato</hi> came for <hi>Sicily. Dionyſius,</hi> to palliate his ſecret ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, before <hi>Plato</hi> came away, treated him with great Entertainments, and all ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demonſtrations of kindneſs; but could not forbear breaking out one day into
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:36410:281"/>
ſuch an expreſſion as this; <hi>No doubt,</hi> Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>but when you are at home among the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers your Companions, you will complain of me, and reckon up a great many of my faults.</hi> To which <hi>Plato</hi> ſmiling, return'd Anſwer, <hi>I hope, Sir, we ſhall never be ſo put to it in the Academy, for want of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to diſcourſe of, as to talk of you.</hi> Thus they ſay <hi>Plato</hi> was diſmiſſed; but his own Writings do not altogether agree with <note place="margin">Sent away again.</note> this Relation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dion</hi> was very angry at this, and not long after he declared himſelf an open E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> having received ſome intelligence concerning his Wife, about which <hi>Plato</hi> by Letters had held a Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with <hi>Dionyſius;</hi> now thus it was. After <hi>Dion</hi>'s Baniſhment, <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back <hi>Plato,</hi> deſired him to ask <hi>Dion</hi> privately, if he would be againſt his Wife's marrying another Man: (for there went a report, whether true, or raiſed by <hi>Dion</hi>'s Enemies, was uncertain; that his Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was not pleaſing to him, and that he lived with his Wife uneaſie and diſſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:) When <hi>Plato</hi> therefore came to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> and had diſcourſed the matter with <hi>Dion,</hi> he writ a Letter to <hi>Dionyſius</hi> in which he expreſſed every thing elſe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and intelligibly; but this affair in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and abſtruſe terms, that none elſe but
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:36410:281"/>
he might underſtand it; ſignifying therein to him, that he had talked with <hi>Dion</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the buſineſs, and that it was evident, he would highly reſent the Affront, if <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyſius</hi> ſhould attempt any ſuch thing: At that time therefore, while there were yet great hopes of an accommodation, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered nothing in his Siſters concerns, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering her to live with <hi>Dion</hi>'s Son; but when things were come to that paſs, that no Reconciliation could be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that <hi>Plato,</hi> after his ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, was again ſent away in diſpleaſure, he then forced <hi>Arete,</hi> againſt her will, to Marry <hi>Timocrates,</hi> one of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites; in this Action coming ſhort, even of his Fathers Juſtice and Lenity. For when <hi>Philoxenus,</hi> who had married his Siſter, <hi>Theſte,</hi> being in diſgrace, and is declared Enemy, for fear had fled and left <hi>Sicily,</hi> he ſent for his Siſter and taxed her, that being privy to her Husbands flight, ſhe had not declared it to him: But the Lady, confident and fearleſs, made him this reply: <hi>Do you believe me, Brother, ſo bad a Wife, or ſo timorous a</hi>

                  <hi>Woman, that having known my Husbands flight, I would not have born him company, and ſhared the worſt of his Fortunes? Alas! I was ignorant of it; for better had it been for me, and more honourable, to be called
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:36410:282"/>
the Wife of the Exile</hi> Philoxenus, <hi>than the Siſter of the Tyrant</hi> Dionyſius. 'Tis ſaid, the King admired her ready and confident anſwer; the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> alſo honoured her for her Bravery; inſomuch, that ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained her Dignity and Princely Retinue after the diſſolution of the Tyranny; and when ſhe died, the Citizens, by Publick Decree, attended the Solemnity of her Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.

               <p>From this time, <hi>Dion</hi> ſet his mind whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">

For when <hi>Plato</hi> ſojourned at <hi>Syracuſe, Speucippus</hi> being oftner than he in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with the Citizens, throughly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood how they were inclined; and tho' at firſt he was ſhy of, and ſuſpected their bold talk, fearing they were ſet on by the King to trapan him; yet at length he gave ear and credit to what they ſaid.

and ſuch as by their Example would ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and encourage to action the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Forces <hi>Dion</hi> hoped to have in <hi>Sicily.</hi> Yet theſe Men, when they firſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Expedition was againſt <hi>Dionyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> were troubled and diſheartned, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>Dion,</hi> that hurried on like a mad man by his Paſſion and Deſpair, he raſhly threw both himſelf and them into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Ruin: Nor were they leſs angry with their Commanders and Muſter-Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that they did not in the beginning let them know the deſign of the War. But when he had in an Oration ſet forth the unſafe and weak condition of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Government; and declared that he carryed them rather for Commanders than Soldiers; the Citizens of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Sicilians</hi> having been long ready for a Revolt: and after him, <hi>Alcimenes,</hi> a <hi>Grecian</hi> Noble-man of great Quality and Reputation, who accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the Expedition, harangued them to the ſame effect; they were quiet and contented.</p>
               <p>It was now the midſt of Summer, and the Winds blew which are conſtant to that ſeaſon of the year called by the <hi>Greeks E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſiae;</hi> the Moon being at the full, when <note place="margin">

not be prevailed with, but earneſt to make the beſt uſe of that Opportunity, they urged <hi>Dion</hi> to lead them ſtraight on to the Capital City.

               <p>The firſt that came in to him upon his march, were two hundred Horſe of the <hi>Agrigentines,</hi> who inhabit near <hi>Ecnomus;</hi> and after them, the <hi>Geloans:</hi> Which News ſoon flying to <hi>Syracuſe, Timocrates,</hi> who had married <hi>Dion</hi>'s Wife, the Siſter of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyſius,</hi> and was left Commander in Chief in the City in his abſence, immediately diſpatched a Courrier to <hi>Dionyſius</hi> with an Expreſs concerning <hi>Dion</hi>'s Arrival; while he himſelf took all poſſible care to prevent any ſtirs or tumults that might ariſe in the City; where all were in great ſuſpence, but as yet continued quiet, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to give too much credit to what was reported.

The Fellow accepted a piece of the Fleſh, which
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:36410:286"/>
his Friend offered him, and proceeded in his Journey with all ſpeed: But having travelled hard a good part of the Night, and being, through wearineſs, forced to take a little Reſt, he laid himſelf down in the next convenient place he came to, which was in a Wood near the Road. A Wolf winding the Fleſh, came and ſeized it as it was faſtned to the Mail, and therewith carried it away alſo, in which was the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to <hi>Dionyſius.</hi> The man awaking, and miſſing his Mantua, ſought for it up and down a great while, and not finding it, reſolved not to go to the King without his Letters, but to conceal himſelf, and keep out of the way. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> therefore came to hear of the War in <hi>Sicily,</hi> from other Hands, and that a good while after.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Dion</hi> proceeded in his March, the <hi>Camarineans</hi> joyned his Forces, and many of the Territory of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> revolting, came in to him: the <hi>Leontines</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panians,</hi> who, with <hi>Timocrates,</hi> guarded the <hi>Epipole,</hi> receiving a falſe Alarm, which was ſpread on purpoſe by <hi>Dion,</hi> as if he intended firſt to attack their Cities, left <hi>Timocrates,</hi> and haſted home to take care of their own Concerns. When this News was brought to <hi>Dion,</hi> where he lay near <hi>Macra,</hi> he raiſed his Camp by Night, and came to the River <hi>Anapus,</hi> which
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:36410:287"/>
is diſtant from the City about ten Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs; there he made a halt, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed by the River, directing his Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the riſing Sun. The South-ſayers declared, That the Gods promiſed him Victory; and they that were preſent ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him aſſiſt at the Sacrifice, with a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land on his head, one and all crowned themſelves with Garlands. There were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five thouſand that joyned his Forces in their March; who, tho' but ill provided with ſuch Weapons as came next to hand, yet by their Briskneſs and Courage, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the want of better Arms; and as if <hi>Dion</hi> were already Conqueror, they ran forward with loud Shouts and Acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, encouraging each other by the Hopes of regaining their long loſt Liberty.

               <p>
                  <hi>Timocrates,</hi> not being able to force his way to the Garriſon that kept the Caſtle, taking Horſe, fled out of the City; and by his Flight fill'd the places where he came with Fear and Confuſion, magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all he could <hi>Dion</hi>'s Forces, leſt he ſhould ſeem upon a ſlight Apprehenſion, to have deſerted the City.

<pb n="552" facs="tcp:36410:288"/>
being deſirous to harangue the People himſelf, he went up by the <hi>Acradina.</hi> The Citizens on each ſide the way brought Beaſts for Sacrifice, ſet out their Tables, Goblets, and ſtanding Plate; and as he paſs'd by, threw Flowers and other <hi>Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia's</hi> upon him, with Vows and Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, honouring him as a God. There was under the Caſtle and <hi>Pentapyla,</hi> a lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſtately Sun-Dial which <hi>Dionyſius</hi> had ſet up; getting up upon the top of that, he made an Oration to the People, perſwading them to maintain and defend their Liberty; who with great expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Joy and Acknowledgment, created <hi>Dion</hi> and <hi>Megacles</hi> Lieutenant-Generals, <note place="margin">Is choſen General.</note> chuſing at their Requeſt and Deſire, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty other Collegues of which half were of thoſe who returned out of Baniſhment.

But becauſe it was a Sun-Dial on the which he ſtood when he was made General, they expreſſed ſome Fears, that the great Actions he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, might be ſubject to decline, and admit a ſudden change of Fortune.</p>

what to do, or how to employ the Aid they brought; not being able to hear the Commands of their Officers, for the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Noiſe and Confuſion of the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> which fled from the Enemy; and do what they could, ran in among them, and broke through their Ranks; till <hi>Dion</hi> ſeeing none of his Orders could be heard, reſolved to let them ſee by his Example what they ought to do; and charged into the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the Enemy: The Fight about him was fierce and bloody; for he being ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally known, as well by the Enemy as his own Party, they ran with great Noiſe and Fury to the Quarter where he fought.

a Detachment of the foreign Soldiers out of <hi>Acradina,</hi> where he had poſted them to guard that Place, he brought them as a freſh Reſerve upon the Enemy, who were tired with the heat of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and well nigh ready to give over their Deſign; for having hopes at their firſt Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley to have re-taken the City, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their Expectation, they found ſuch <note place="margin">

               <p>Soon after this, there came Meſſengers from <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> bringing <hi>Dion</hi> Letters from the Ladies his Relations; and one <note place="margin">Letters ſent to <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> from <hi>Dionyſius.</hi>
                  </note> was ſuperſcribed, <hi>Hipparinus to his Father</hi> Dion: this was the Name of <hi>Dion</hi>'s Son, tho' <hi>Timaeus</hi> ſays, he was from his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Arete</hi>'s Name, called <hi>Aretoeus;</hi> but I think credit is rather to be given to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi>'s Report, who was his fellow-Soldier and Confident. The reſt of the Letters
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:36410:290"/>
were read publickly, containing many <note place="margin">Read pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly.</note> Sollicitations and humble Requeſts of the Ladies; but the People not admitting that which was ſent from his Son to be unſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Dion</hi> forcibly broke it open. It was from <hi>Dionyſius</hi> ſeemingly writ to <hi>Dion,</hi> but in effect to the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> and ſo worded, that under a plauſible Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, and civil Requeſts to him, was couch'd a Deſign of rendring him ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the People. He reminded him of the good Service he had formerly done the Government, and how vigorous an Aſſertor he had been of the Prerogative; adding many Threats to his deareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his Siſter, Son and Wife, if he did not comply with the Contents; conjuring him in the moſt paſſionate and moving Expreſſions to have regard to their Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But that which touched <hi>Dion</hi> moſt, was, he earneſtly entreated him, That he would not deſtroy the Government, but take it upon himſelf, and not put the Power into the Hands of thoſe men, who always hated him, and would never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their old Picques and Quarrels, but keep it in his own, and thereby ſecure from Injuries and Violence himſelf, his Friends, and Dependants.</p>
               <p>When this Letter was read, the Mobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le did not (as they ought in Juſtice) pay

a due Deference to the unmoveable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and Bravery of <hi>Dion,</hi> who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all his moſt preſſing Concerns, to be true to his Virtue, and his Honour; but from hence took occaſion to fear and <note place="margin">Dion <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</hi>

                  <hi>Heraclides</hi> openly pretended much Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance for <hi>Dion,</hi> and made him great Acknowledgments for this Favour, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with all Submiſſion, as ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Commands; but underhand he dealt with, and tainted the Mobile and Innovators, ſo that he involved <hi>Dion</hi> in perpetual Diſturbances, and created him much Perplexity and diſquiet; for if he advis'd to give <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Paſs-port to leave the Caſtle, he was cenſured as deſigning to deliver and protect him: if to avoid gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the People any Trouble or Suſpicion, he continued the Siege, they cryed out, He protracted the War the longer to keep his Command of General, and over-awe the Citizens. There was one <hi>Soſis,</hi> noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the City for a bold and wicked Villain, yet a great Pretender to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Property of the Subject; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that which conſiſts in the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable Freedom of their Tongues. This Fellow plotting againſt <hi>Dion,</hi> ſtood up one <note place="margin">Soſis <hi>plots againſt</hi> Dion.</note> Day in an Aſſembly, and having ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently railed at the Citizens, as a parcel of Sots and Blockheads, that could not ſee how they had made an Exchange of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and drunken Tyrant, for a ſober and crafty Maſter, publickly declared, he was abſolutely againſt <hi>Dion,</hi> and Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Government; and ſo he took his leave
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:36410:292"/>
of the Company. The next day he was ſeen running through the Streets (as if he fled from ſome that purſued him) almoſt ſtark naked, wounded in the head, and bloody all over: in this pickle getting the Rabble about him, he told them, that he was barbarouſly aſſaulted by <hi>Dion</hi>'s Men; and to confirm what he ſaid ſtew'd them the Wounds he had received in his Head. The Mobile in general took his part, raging and railing againſt <hi>Dion,</hi> as cruel and tyrannical, who took ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Courſes to ſtop the Mouths of the People, by knocking them on the Head. Juſt as they were in this ſeditious and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous Hurly-burly, <hi>Dion</hi> came to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate himſelf, and made it appear, That this <hi>Soſis</hi> was Brother to one of <hi>Dionyſius</hi>'s Guard; and that he was ſet on by him to embroil the City in Tumult and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: <hi>Dionyſius</hi> having now no way left for his Security, but to make his Advantage of their Diſſentions and Diſtractions. The Chyrurgions alſo having ſearched the Wound, found it was rather raz'd, than cut with a down-right Blow; for the Wounds made with a Weapon are moſt commonly deepeſt in the middle, but this was very ſlight, and all along of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual depth; that it was not one continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Wound, as if cut at once, but ſeveral
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:36410:293"/>
Inciſions, in all probability, made at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, as he was able to endure the Pain. There were ſome too that knew him, who brought a Razor, and ſhewed it openly to the Company, declaring, That they met <hi>Soſis</hi> running in the Street all bloody, who told them, That he had narrowly eſcaped with his Life from <hi>Dion</hi>'s Soldiers, who had ſorely wounded, and were ſtill in purſuit of him. They haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to take the Purſuers, could meet with no man, but ſpyed this Razor lying under a hollow Stone near the place from which they obſerved he came. <hi>Soſis</hi> was now like to go by the worſt of it. But when, to back all this, his own Servants came in and gave Evidence, That he came out of his own Houſe alone before break of Day, with a Razor in his Hand, <hi>Dion</hi>'s Accuſers ſneak'd away, and the People by <note place="margin">Is found guilty of falſe Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and condemn'd to die.</note> a general Vote, condemned <hi>Soſis</hi> to die, being once again well ſatisfied with <hi>Dion,</hi> and his Proceedings.</p>
               <p>Yet they were ſtill no leſs jealous of his Soldiers, and the rather becauſe the War was now carried on principally by Sea; for that <hi>Philiſtus</hi> was come from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulia</hi> with a great Fleet to <hi>Dionyſius</hi>'s Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, <note place="margin">

arm'd accordingly, and rather in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be protected by them, who were skilful Sea-men, and depended at preſent chiefly upon the ſtrength of their Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. They grew alſo more haughty, and ſelf-conceited, by the Advantage they got in an engagement by Sea, in which they took <hi>Philiſtus</hi> Priſoner, and us'd him in a moſt barbarous and cruel manner. <hi>Ephorus</hi> relates, That when he ſaw his Ship was taken he ſlew himſelf. But <hi>Timonides,</hi> who from the beginning of the War was with <hi>Dion</hi> in all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Actions, writing to <hi>Speucippus</hi> the Philoſopher, relates the Story, That <hi>Philiſtus</hi>'s Galley running a-ground, he <note place="margin">Taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and ſlain.</note> was taken Priſoner alive, and firſt diſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, then ſtript, and expoſed ſtark naked, tho' an old Man, to all ſorts of Scorn and Contumely; afterward they cut off his Head, and gave the Rabble his Body, who drag'd it along the <hi>Acradina,</hi> and then threw it into a Common-ſhore. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus</hi> upbraiding him, adds further, That the Boys tied him by his lame Leg, and ſo drew him through the Streets of the City, while the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> inſulted over his Carkaſs, to ſee him tied by the Leg, who ſaid, It would not become <hi>Dionyſius</hi> to be beholding to the Swiftneſs of his Horſe to fly from his Throne, but rather
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:36410:294"/>
to be drag'd from thence by the Heels; tho' <hi>Philiſtus</hi> relates, That this was ſaid to <hi>Dionyſius</hi> by another, and not by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

                  <hi>Dion</hi> then ſtood up, and began to ſpeak, but a flood of Tears ſtopt his words: his Soldiers were ſenſibly troubled at his Grief, praying him to moderate his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and proceed: When he had therefore recovered himſelf a little, <hi>Gentlemen</hi> (ſays <note place="margin">His Speech to his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> he) <hi>and fellow-ſoldiers, I have called you here together to take care of your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, for it will ill become me to conſult my ſelf if</hi> Syracuſe <hi>be loſt; which tho' I cannot ſave from Deſtruction, I will never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs haſten thither, and be buried in the Ruines of my Country, yet if you can find in your hearts to aſſiſt us, the moſt inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and unfortunate of Men, you may to your eternal Honour, again retrieve this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy City. But if the</hi> Syracuſians <hi>can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no more pity nor relief from you, may the Gods reward you for what you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly valiantly done for them, and for your conſtant fidelity and kindneſs to</hi> Dion; <hi>who you muſt remember, as he deſerted you not, when injur'd and abus'd, ſo he cannot now forſake his fellow-Citizens in their Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Misfortunes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before he had well ended his Speech, the Soldiers with a great ſhout teſtified their readineſs for the Service, crying out, <hi>To march immediately to the Relief of the City.</hi> The <hi>Syracuſian</hi> Courriers hugg'd and embrac'd them, praying the Gods to
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:36410:299"/>
ſhower down Bleſſings upon <hi>Dion</hi> and his valiant <hi>Peloponneſians.</hi> When the noiſe was pretty well over, <hi>Dion</hi> gave Orders that all ſhould to their Quarters, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for their March; and having reſreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, come compleatly Armed to their Rendezvous in the very place they now were; reſolving that very night to haſten to their Succour.</p>
               <p>Now, at <hi>Syracuſe, Dionyſius</hi>'s Soldiers, as long as day continued, ranſacked the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dionyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s Men retreat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</note> City, and did all the miſchief they could; but when Night came on, they retir'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Caſtle, miſſing very few of their number; at which the factious Ring-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders taking heart, and hoping the Enemy would reſt content with what they had done, and make no further Attempt upon them; perſwaded the People again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>Dion,</hi> and if he came with the Foreign Soldiers, not to admit him; adviſing them not to yield, as inferior to them in point of Honour and Courage; but to ſave their City, and defend their Liberties and Properties themſelves. The Popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy therefore and their Leaders ſend Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers to <hi>Dion,</hi> to forbid him to advance; but the Nobility and the Horſe ſent others to him, to deſire him to haſten his March: For which reaſon he ſlack'd his pace, and came forward but ſlowly; and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle

of the Night the Faction that was againſt him ſet a Guard upon the Gates of the City to hinder him from coming in.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Nypſius</hi> made another Salley out of <note place="margin">Make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sally.</note> the Caſtle with a far greater number of Men than before, who quite ruined what of the Rampart was left ſtanding, and fell in pell-mell to ſack and ravage the City. The ſlaughter was now very great, not only of the Men, but of the Women alſo and Children; for they regarded not ſo much the Plunder, as to deſtroy and kill all they met. For <hi>Dionyſius</hi> deſpairing to re-gain the Kingdom, and mortally ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> reſolved to bury his loſt Empire in the utter Ruin and Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Syracuſe.</hi> The Enemy therefore to prevent <hi>Dion</hi>'s Succours, reſolved upon the moſt terrible and ready way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, to lay the City in aſhes; firing all at hand with Torches and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtibles; <note place="margin">Fire the City.</note> and at diſtance with flaming Arrows, and other Fire-works, ſhot from their Bows and Engines. The Citizens in great diſtraction fled every way before them. They who to avoid the Fire for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook their Houſes, were taken in the Streets, and put to the Sword: They who betook themſelves for Refuge into the the Houſes, were forced out again by the
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:36410:300"/>
flames. Many were burnt, and many kill'd by the fall of Houſes and Ruines of Walls and Towers. This freſh misfortune by general Conſent opened the Gates for <hi>Dion:</hi> It hapned that he made no extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary haſt when he received advice, that the Enemies were retreated into the Caſtle; but early in the Morning ſome Horſe brought him the news of another Aſſault; and ſoon after ſome of thoſe who before oppos'd his coming, fled now to him, to entreat him he would haſten his Relief. The Fire and Deſolation increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, <hi>Heraclides</hi> ſent his Brother, and after him, his Uncle <hi>Theodotes,</hi> to beg him to help them, for that now they were not able to make any longer Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; that he himſelf was wounded, and the greateſt part of the City was either in aſhes, or in flames.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Dion</hi> met this ſad News, he was about ſixty furlongs diſtant from the City. When he had acquainted the Soldiers with the Exigency, and exhorted them to behave themſelves like men; the Army no longer marched, but ran forwards, and by the way were met by ſeveral who begged them to quicken their pace. By the wonderful eagerneſs of the Soldiers, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dion</hi> and his Men come to their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.</note> and their extraordinary Speed, <hi>Dion</hi> quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came to the City, and entered at the

Gate <hi>Hecatompedon,</hi> ſending his Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard preſently to charge the Enemy; that ſeeing them, the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> might take Courage: In the mean time he drew up in good Order his main Body, and all the Citizens that came in and joyn'd him; forming his Battalions long, and ſetting over them double Officers, that he might, as occaſion required, make Detachments, and to amuſe and terrifie the Enemy, fight them in ſeveral Quarters at once. As they ſaw him in the Streets advance at the Head of his Men to engage the Enemy, a confuſed Noiſe of Shouts, congratulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Vows, and Prayers was rais'd by the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> who now called <hi>Dion</hi> their Deliverer, their Tutelar-Deity, and his Soldiers their Friends, Brethren, and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Citizens; none ſeem'd to regard themſelves, or value their ſafeties, but to be concerned more for <hi>Dion</hi>'s Life, than for all their own together. So daringly he marched before them to meet the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, firſt through Blood and Fire, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heaps of dead Bodies that lay in his way.</p>
               <p>And indeed the Poſture of the Enemy was in appearance terrible; for they were fluſh'd with Victory, enrag'd, and had poſted themſelves very advantageouſly along the demoliſh'd Works, which made
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:36410:301"/>
the approach to them very hazardous and difficult: yet that which diſcouraged <hi>Dion</hi>'s Men moſt was the apprehenſion they were in of the Fire, which made their march very troubleſome and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; <note place="margin">March in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thró the Ruins.</note> for the Houſes being in flames on all fides, they were ſurrounded with them, and treading upon burning Ruines, every minute in danger of being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd with falling Houſes, through clouds of Aſhes and Smoak they labour'd hard to keep their Order, and maintain their Ranks. When they came near to the Enemy, by reaſon of the advantage of their Poſt, and the inconvenience of a Defile they were to paſs, but few of them could engage at a time; but at length fighting with great Bravery, and the <hi>Syracuſians</hi> with ſhouts encouraging their Party, <hi>Nypſius</hi>'s Men were beaten <note place="margin">Beat <hi>Nyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The next day not one of the Popular Haranguers <note place="margin">The Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues leave the City:</note> durſt ſtay in the City, but all of them, knowing their own Guilt, by their flight confeſſed it, and ſecured their Lives.

Tho' they humbly addreſſed to him, his Friends adviſed him not to pardon thoſe turbulent and ill-natured Men, but to leave them to the mercy of his Soldiers, and utterly root out of the Common-wealth the ambitious Affectation of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulacy; a Diſeaſe as peſtilent and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as the moſt Arbitrary Power what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. <hi>Dion</hi> endeavoured to ſatisfie them, telling them, That other Generals em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their thoughts and deſigns chiefly about warlike Acquiſts; but that he had long ſtudied in the <hi>Academy</hi> how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:36410:302"/>
his Paſſions, and not let Emulation and Envy conquer him. That to do this, it is not ſufficient that a Man be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and kind to his Friends, and thoſe that have deſerved well of him; but alſo indulgent and favourable to thoſe from whom he has received Injuries and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts. That he was reſolved to let the World ſee that he valued not himſelf ſo much upon excelling <hi>Heraclides</hi> in Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Conduct, as he did in out-doing him in Juſtice and Clemency; herein to have the Advantage is to excell indeed. The Honour of Victory in War is never entire; for Fortune will be ſure to claim her ſhare, tho' no man pretend to rival the Conqueror. What if <hi>Heraclides</hi> be perfidious, malicious, and baſe, muſt <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> therefore ſully his Honor, or injure his Vertue by a paſſionate Concern for it? For tho' the Laws determine it juſter to revenge an Injury, than to do an Injury; Yet it is evident, that both Originally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the ſame deficiency and weakneſs of Humane Nature: The malicious Humor of Men, tho' perverſe and refractory, is not ſo ſavage and invincible, but it may be wrought upon by Kindneſs, and habitually <note place="margin">Dion <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclides <hi>and</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odotes.</note> altered by repeated Obligations. <hi>Dion</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of theſe Arguments, pardon'd and diſmiſs'd <hi>Heraclides</hi> and <hi>Theodotes.</hi>

                  <hi>Heraclides</hi> began again to ſet up againſt him; and being ſent for one day by <hi>Dion</hi> to Council, he refus'd to come, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult otherwiſe than as a private Citizen, and in a Publick Aſſembly. Soon after, he impeacht <hi>Dion,</hi> becauſe he had not demoliſh'd the Cittadel, and becauſe he had hindred the People from throwing down <hi>Dionyſius</hi>'s Tomb, and doing deſpite
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:36410:306"/>
to the Dead; moreover, he accus'd him for ſending to <hi>Corinth</hi> for Counſellors and Aſſiſtants in the Government, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by neglecting and ſlighting his Fellow-Citizens. And indeed he had prevail'd with ſome <hi>Corinthians</hi> to come to him, hoping by their means and preſence the better to ſettle that Government he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; for he deſign'd to reſtrain the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Power of the People; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is not a Government, but (as <hi>Plato</hi> calls it) a Market, where Authority is bought and ſold; and to introduce and eſtabliſh a mixt Policy made up of the <hi>Spartan</hi> and <hi>Cretian,</hi> betwixt a Common-wealth and a Monarchy, wherein the Nobles did preſide and manage the Affairs of greateſt Conſequence; for he ſaw the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were chiefly govern'd by the Grandees, and that the People were but little concern'd in Publick Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Now, knowing that. <hi>Heraclides</hi> would be his moſt conſiderable Adverſary, who was always a turbulent, fickle, and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man; he gave way to ſome, whom formerly he hindred when they deſigned to kill him, who breaking in, Murder'd <note place="margin">He is mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd by <hi>Dion</hi>'s means.</note> 
                  <hi>Heraclides</hi> in his own Houſe. His Death was much reſented by the Citizens: <hi>Dion</hi> made him a ſplendid Funeral, follow'd his Herſe with all his Soldiers, and made
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:36410:306"/>
an Oration to the People; by which they underſtood, that it would have been impoſſible to have kept the City quiet, as long as <hi>Dion</hi> and <hi>Heraclides</hi> were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors in the Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dion</hi> had a Friend, call'd <hi>Calippus,</hi> an <note place="margin">Calippus <hi>the</hi> Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian.</note> 
                  <hi>Athenian,</hi> who, <hi>Plato</hi> ſays, grew famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar with him, and his Confident: not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the merit of his Learning, but becauſe he was introduc'd by him into ſome My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious Ceremonies of their Religion, and ſo contracted an accidental Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauce. This man was all along with him in the Army in great Honour and Eſteem, being the firſt of his Friends, who march'd by his ſide into <hi>Syracuſe</hi> with a Garland upon his Head, for that he had behav'd himſelf very well in all the Action, and made himſelf remarkable for his Courage and Gallantry. He finding that <hi>Dion</hi>'s principal and moſt conſiderable Friends were cut off in the War, <hi>Heraclides</hi> now dead, and the People without a Leader, and that the Soldiers had a great Kindneſs for him, like a perfidious and wicked Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, in hopes to get the Chief Command of <hi>Sicily,</hi> by the ruin of his Friend and Benefactor; and, as ſome ſay, being brib'd by the Enemy with twenty Talents to deſtroy <hi>Dion,</hi> inveagled and engag'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Soldiers in a Conſpiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:36410:307"/>
him, laying this cunning and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beginning of his Plot. He daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd <hi>Dion</hi> what he heard, or what he feign'd the Soldiers ſaid againſt him; whereby he gain'd that Credit and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that he was allowed by <hi>Dion</hi> to conſort privately with whom he would, and talk freely againſt him in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Company, that he might diſcover who were his ſecret and factious Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants. By this means <hi>Calippus</hi> in ſhort time got together a Cabal of all the ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Diſcontents in the City; and if any one who would not be drawn in, advis'd <hi>Dion</hi> that he was tampered with, he was not troubled or concern'd at it; believing <hi>Calippus</hi> did it in compliance with his Directions.</p>
               <p>While this Conſpiracy was a foot, a <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dion</hi> ſees ae ſtrange Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> ſtrange and dreadful Apparition was ſeen by <hi>Dion,</hi> as he ſat one Evening in a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery in his Houſe, melancholy and thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, hearing a ſudden Noiſe, he turn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and ſaw at the end of the Room, by clear day-light, a tall Woman, in her Countenance and Garb like one of the Tragical Furies, with a Broom in her Hand ſweeping the floor; being amaz'd, and terribly affrighted, he ſent for ſome of his Friends, and told them what he had ſeen; entreating them to ſtay with
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:36410:307"/>
him, and keep him company all Night; for he was greatly aſtoniſh'd and perplext, fearing that if he were left alone, the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctre would again appear to him: He ſaw that no more. But a few days after, his only Son, being almoſt grown up to mans Eſtate, upon ſome diſpleaſure and pet he had taken upon a Childiſh and frivolous Occaſion threw himſelf headlong from <note place="margin">His Son breaks his Neck.</note> the top of the Houſe, and brake his Neck.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Dion</hi> was under this Affliction, <hi>Calippus</hi> drove on his Conſpiracy, and ſpread a Rumour among the <hi>Syracuſians,</hi> That <hi>Dion</hi> being now Childleſs, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to ſend for <hi>Dionyſius</hi>'s Son, <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> who was his Wife's Nephew, and Siſter's Grand-Son, and make him his Heir and Succeſſor. By this time, <hi>Dion,</hi> his Wife, and Siſter began to ſuſpect what <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dion</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of the Plot.</note> was doing, and were from all hands confirm'd in the Belief of the Plot. <hi>Dion</hi> as 'tis probable, being troubled for <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clides</hi> Murder, which was like to be a blot and ſtain upon his Honour, and the great Actions of his Life, in great anxiety and diſquiet declar'd, he had rather die a thouſand times, and open his Breaſt himſelf to the Aſſaſſine, than live not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in fear of his Enemies, but ſuſpicion of his Friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="592" facs="tcp:36410:308"/>
                  <hi>Calippus</hi> ſeeing the Ladies very inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive to ſearch the bottom of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and fearing the event, came to them, utterly denying it with Tears in his Eyes; and offering to give them whatſoever aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of his Fidelity they deſir'd: They requir'd, That he would take the great Teſt and ſolemn Oath, which was after this manner: The Juror went<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into the Temple of <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Proſerpine;</hi> after the performance of ſome Ceremonies, he was clad in the Purple Veſtment of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, and holding a lighted Torch in his Hand, took his Oath. <hi>Calippus</hi> did as <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Calippus</hi> denies it upon Oath.</note> they requir'd, and forſwore the Fact. But he ſo little valued the Goddeſs, that he ſtay'd but till the Feſtival of <hi>Proſerpine,</hi> by whom he had Sworn, and on that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day committed his intended Murder; diſregarding the Solemnity of the Day, for that he knew he muſt at any other time as impiouſly offend her whenſoever he, who introduc'd him into her Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould be the Murderer of her Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>There were a great many in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy; and as <hi>Dion</hi> was at home with ſeveral of his Friends in his Entertaining-Room, ſome of the Conſpirators beſet the Houſe round, others ſecur'd the Doors and Windows. The Aſſaſſines were <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinthians,</hi>
                  <pb n="593" facs="tcp:36410:308"/>
who went in to him in their ordinary Habit unarm'd. The Guard without ſhut the Doors upon them, and kept them faſt. The Murderers fell upon him, endeavouring to ſtifle and diſpatch him; but not being able, they call'd for a Sword, but none durſt open the Door: There were a great many within with <hi>Dion,</hi> but every one was for ſecuring himſelf; ſuppoſing, that by letting him loſe his Life, he ſhould ſave his own; and therefore no man ventur'd to aſſiſt him. When they had waited a good while, at length <hi>Lycon</hi> the <hi>Syracuſian,</hi> reach'd a ſhort Sword in at the Window to one of the <hi>Zacinthians,</hi> and ſtunn'd and almoſt ſenſeleſs as he was, like a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at the Altar, they cut <hi>Dion</hi>'s Throat; his Siſter and Wife big with Child they hurried to Priſon, who, poor Lady, in her unfortunate condition, was there brought to Bed of a Son, which by the conſent of the Keepers they intended to bring up, the rather becauſe <hi>Calippus</hi> began already to be embroyl'd in Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
               <p>After the Murther of <hi>Dion,</hi> he was the <note place="margin">Calippus <hi>Chief at</hi> Syracuſe.</note> only man that was look'd upon, had the ſole Government of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> in his Hands; and to that effect writ to <hi>Athens,</hi> a place, which, next the Immortal Gods, being
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:36410:309"/>
guilty of ſuch an abominable Crime, he ought to have reverenc'd and fear'd. But true it is, what is ſaid of that City, That the good Men ſhe breeds are the moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and the bad the moſt notorious; as their Country <hi>Attica<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> produces the moſt delicious Honey, and the moſt deadly Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <hi>Calippus</hi> did not long continue to ſcandalize Fortune, and upbraid the Gods with his Proſperity, who ſeem'd to wink at, and bear with that wretched man, while he purchas'd Riches and Power by the moſt heinous and enormous Impieties, but he quickly receiv'd the Puniſhment he deſerv'd; for going to take <hi>Catana,</hi> he loſt <hi>Syracuſe;</hi> whereupon they report he ſaid, He had loſt a City, and got a Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Then attempting <hi>Meſſene,</hi> he had moſt of his Men cut off, and among the reſt, <hi>Dion</hi>'s Murtherers. When no City in <hi>Sicily</hi> would admit him, but all hated and abhorred him, he went into <hi>Italy,</hi> and took <hi>Regium;</hi> there being neceſſitous, and not able to maintain his Soldiers, he was kill'd by <hi>Leptimns</hi> and <hi>Polyperchon,</hi>

But this <hi>Brutus,</hi> whoſe Life we now write, having to the goodneſs of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition added the Improvements of Learning, and ſtudy of Philoſophy, and having ſtirr'd up his natural Parts, of themſelves grave and gentle, by applying himſelf to Buſineſs and publick Affairs, ſeems to have been of a Temper exactly fram'd for Vertue; inſomuch that they who were moſt his Enemies, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Conſpiracy againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> if in that whole Affair there was any honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable or generous Action done, refer it wholly to <hi>Brutus,</hi> and lay whatever was barbarous and cruel to the charge of <hi>Caſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Brutus</hi>'s moſt intimate and familiar Friend, but not at all like him in Honeſty and Virtue. His Mother <hi>Servilia</hi> was of the Family of <hi>Servilius Hala,</hi> who when <hi>Spurius Manlius</hi> had work'd the People in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Rebellion, and deſign'd to have made himſelf King, taking a Dagger under his Arm, went forth into the Market-place, and upon pretence of having ſome private

But <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidonius</hi> the Philoſopher writes, that it is true indeed what the Hiſtory relates, that two of the Sons of <hi>Brutus,</hi> who were of mens Eſtate, were put to Death, but that a third, yet an Infant, was leſt alive from whom the Family was propagated down to <hi>Marcus Brutus;</hi> and further, that there were ſeveral famous Perſons of this Houſe in his Time, and of his own Acquaintance, whoſe Looks very much reſembled the Statue of <hi>Junius Brutus.</hi> But of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject enough.</p>

In his Epiſtles eſpecially, as when in the beginning of the War he writ thus to the <hi>Pergamenians: I hear ye have given</hi> Dolabella <hi>Money; if you gave it willingly, ye muſt own ye have injur'd me; if unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhew it, by giving willingly to me.</hi> And another time to the <hi>Samians: Your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils are careleſs, your Actions ſlow; what think ye will be the end?</hi> And of the <hi>Pata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi> thus: <hi>The</hi> Xanthians <hi>ſuſpecting my Kindneſs, have made their Countrey a Grave of Deſpair; The</hi> Patareans <hi>truſting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to me, have loſt nothing of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Liberty; It is in your Power to chooſe the Judgment of the</hi> Patareans, <hi>or the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the</hi> Xanthians.

recover'd of a Fit of Sickneſs. He obey'd his Orders, but with a great deal of unwillingneſs, as well out of Reſpect to <hi>Caninius,</hi> that was thrown out of this Employment by <hi>Cato</hi> with ſo much Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; as alſo becauſe he eſteem'd ſuch a Commiſſion too mean for a Gentleman, and not at all becoming him that was in the prime of his Youth, and given to Books and Learning. Nevertheleſs, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying himſelf to this Buſineſs, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd himſelf ſo well in it, that he was highly commended by <hi>Cato,</hi> and having turn'd all the Goods of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> into ready Money, brought the greateſt part of it in his own Ship to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the Diviſion of the Empire into two Factions, when <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> taking up Arms againſt one another, the whole Government was turn'd into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, it was generally believ'd that he would have taken <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s ſide; for his Father not long before had been put to Death by <hi>Pompey.</hi> But he thinking it his duty to prefer the Intereſt of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick before his own private Reſentments, and judging <hi>Pompey</hi>'s to be the better Cauſe, took part with him; tho' former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he us'd not ſo much as to ſalute or take any notice of <hi>Pompey,</hi> if he happen'd to meet him, eſteeming it a great crime to

have the leaſt Converſation with the Murtherer of his Father. But now look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him as the General of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, he liſted himſelf under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and ſet Sail for <hi>Sicily,</hi> in quality of Lieutenant to <hi>Seſtius,</hi> who had the Government of that Iſland. But finding no opportunity there of ſhewing himſelf in any great Action, and hearing that <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> were encamp'd near one another, and were preparing to begin the Battle, upon which the whole Empire depended, he came of his own accord to <hi>Macedonia</hi> to partake in the Danger. At his coming, it is ſaid, that <hi>Pompey</hi> was ſo ſurpriz'd, and ſo pleas'd, that riſing from his Chair, in the ſight of all his Guards, he ſaluted and embrac'd him, as one of the chiefeſt of his Party. All the time that he was in the Camp, expecting that which he ſpent in <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, he employ'd in Reading and in Study, which he did not neglect even the day before the great Battle of <hi>Pharſalia.</hi> It was the middle of Summer, and the Heat was very great, and the Camp ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd many inconveniencies, by being lodged in a marſhy Ground, and they that carry'd <hi>Brutus</hi> his Tent, had ſtay'd a long while before they came.

haraſs'd, and out of order, having at laſt in the middle of the day ſcarcely anointed himſelf, and eaten very ſparingly, whilſt moſt others were either laid to ſleep, or were wholly taken up with the thoughts and apprehenſions of what would be the iſſue of the Fight, he ſpent his whole time till the evening in writing an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of <hi>Polybius.</hi> It is ſaid, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> had ſo great a regard for him, that he order'd his Commanders by no means to kill <hi>Brutus</hi> in the Battle, but to ſpare him, if poſſible, and bring him ſafe to him, if he would willingly ſurrender himſelf; but if he made any Reſiſtance, to ſuffer him to eſcape, rather than do him any Violence. And this he is believ'd to have done out of a Tenderneſs to <hi>Servilia,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Brutus;</hi> for <hi>Caeſar</hi> had, it ſeems, in his Youth, being very intimate with her, and ſhe paſſionately in Love with him: And conſidering that <hi>Brutus</hi> was born about that time, in which their Loves were at the higheſt, <hi>Caeſar</hi> had ſome Reaſon to believe that he was begot by him. There goes a Report too, that when ſome great and weighty Matters concerning the Conſpiracy of <hi>Catiline,</hi> which had like to have been the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Commonwealth, were deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Senate; <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> tho'
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:36410:315"/>
differing in their Opinions, were placed near to one another: In the middle of the Debate a little Note was deliver'd to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> from without, which he took and read ſilently to himſelf. Upon this <hi>Cato</hi> cry'd out aloud, and accus'd <hi>Caeſar</hi> for holding Correſpondence, and receiving Letters from the Enemies of the Common-wealth: Many of the Senators being much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, and the Houſe in an Uproar, <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> deliver'd the Note, as he had receiv'd it, to <hi>Cato,</hi> who reading it, found it to be a lewd Letter from his own Siſter <hi>Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> and threw it back again in Rage to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> with theſe words, <hi>Keep it to your ſelf, you Sot.</hi> And the Senate that had been interrupted, fell afreſh to the Buſineſs that was before them; ſo publick and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious was <hi>Servilia</hi>'s Love to <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the great Overthrow at <hi>Pharſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, Pompey</hi> himſelf having made his Eſcape to the Sea, and <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Army ſtorming the Camp, <hi>Brutus</hi> ſtole private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of one of the Gates, to a marſhy Place full of Water, and cover'd with Reeds, from whence ventring out in the Night, he got ſafe to <hi>Lariſſa.</hi> From <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa</hi> he writ to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who expreſs'd a great deal of Joy to hear that he was ſafe, and having ſent for him, not only forgave him freely, but honour'd and eſteem'd
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:36410:315"/>
him equal, at leaſt to his chiefeſt Friends. Now when no-body could give any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Account which way <hi>Pompey</hi> had fled, <hi>Caeſar</hi> took a little Journey alone with <hi>Brutus,</hi> to try what was his Opinion herein, and believing by ſome Diſcourſes which paſs'd between them, that he could give a good gueſs which way <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> had taken in his Flight, laying aſide all other thoughts, he fell directly to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue him towards <hi>Aegypt.</hi> But <hi>Pompey</hi> having reach'd <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as <hi>Brutus</hi> gueſs'd his Deſign was to do, was there barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly murder'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brutus</hi> had ſo much power with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that he pacify'd and reconcil'd him to his Friend <hi>Caſſius;</hi> nay, when he pleaded in defence of the King of the <hi>Lybyans,</hi> tho' he was overwhelm'd with the greatneſs of the Crimes alledg'd againſt him, yet by his Entreaties and Applications to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> in his behalf, he preſerv'd to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great part of his Kingdom. It is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> when he firſt heard <hi>Brutus</hi> ſpeak in publick, ſaid to his Friends, <hi>I know not what this young man intends, but whatever he intends, he intends vehemently.</hi> For his natural firmneſs of Mind, not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yielding or complying in favour of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that entreated him, when it was ſet on work by the Motives of right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:36410:316"/>
and the Principles of Honeſty, which way ſoever it turn'd it ſelf, mov'd with great Vigour and Impetuoſity, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally effected its Deſigns. No Flattery could ever prevail with him to liſten to unjuſt Petitions; and reckon'd that to be overcome by the Impotunities of ſhameleſs and fawning Flatteries, tho' ſome complement it with the Name of Modeſty and Baſhfulneſs, was the fouleſt diſgrace a great Man could ſuffer. And he us'd to ſay, <hi>That he ſhrewdly ſuſpected that they who could deny nothing, had not very honeſtly employ'd the flower of their Youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caeſar</hi> being about to take an Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into <hi>Africa</hi> againſt <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> committed to <hi>Brutus</hi> the Government of <hi>Gallia Ciſalpina,</hi> to the great Happineſs and Advantage of that Province. For while thoſe of other Provinces labour'd under the Violence and Avarice of their Governors, and ſuffer'd as much Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as if they had been Slaves and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of War, <hi>Brutus</hi> put an end to all ſuch Inſolencies here, and by his eaſie Government made them amends for all their former Calamities, and reconcil'd and fix'd all their Affections to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> inſomuch that it was a moſt welcom and pleaſant Spectacle to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> when in his Return he paſs'd through <hi>Italy,</hi> to ſee the
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:36410:316"/>
Cities that were under <hi>Brutus</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and <hi>Brutus</hi> himſelf increaſing his Train and Honour, and moſt obligingly attending him in his Progreſs.</p>
               <p>Now ſeveral <hi>Praetorſhips</hi> being void, it was all mens opinion, that that of the chiefeſt Dignity, which is call'd the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip</hi> of the City, would be conferr'd either upon <hi>Brutus</hi> or <hi>Caſſius;</hi> and ſome ſay, that there having been ſome little difference upon former Accounts between them, this Competition ſet them much more at variance, tho' they were related to each other, <hi>Caſſius</hi> having married <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Brutus.</hi> Others ſay, that this Contention was rais'd between them by <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s means, who had private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given each of them ſuch hopes of his favouring their Pretenſions, as made them break out into this open Competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Tryal of their Intereſt. <hi>Brutus</hi> had only the Reputation of his Honour and virtue to oppoſe to the many and gallant Actions perform'd by <hi>Caſſius</hi> in his Youth againſt the <hi>Parthians.</hi> But <hi>Caeſar</hi> having heard each ſide, and deliberating about the Matter among his Friends, ſaid, Caſſius <hi>indeed pleads with moſt Juſtice, but</hi> Brutus <hi>muſt have the firſt</hi> Praetorſhip. So another <hi>Praetorſhip</hi> was given to <hi>Caſſius;</hi> but the gaining of this could not ſo much
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:36410:317"/>
oblige, him, as he was incens'd for the loſs of the other. And in all other things <hi>Brutus</hi> was partaker of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Power as much as he deſir'd; for he might, if he had pleas'd, been the chief of all his Friends, and had Authority and Command beyond them all, but <hi>Caſſius</hi> by his Converſation drew him off from <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and turn'd him to himſelf. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he was not yet wholly reconcil'd to <hi>Caſſius,</hi> ſince that Competition which was between them; but yet he gave ear to <hi>Caſſius</hi> his Friends, who were perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally adviſing him not to be ſo blind, as to ſuffer himſelf to be ſoften'd and won up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but to ſhun the Kindneſs and Favours of a Tyrant, which they inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhew'd him, not to expreſs any Honour to his Merit or Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but to unbend his Strength, and ſlacken the vigour of his Mind. Neither was <hi>Caeſar</hi> wholly without ſuſpicion of him, nor wanted Informers that accus'd <hi>Brutus</hi> to him; but he fear'd indeed the high Spirit, and the great Authority, and the many Friends that he had, but thought himſelf ſecure in his Honeſty and Virtue. When it was told him firſt that <hi>Antony</hi> and <hi>Dolabella</hi> deſign'd ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, <hi>It is not,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the fat and the long-hair'd men that I fear, but the pale
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:36410:317"/>
and the lean,</hi> meaning <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius.</hi> Afterwards when ſome accus'd <hi>Brutus</hi> to him, and advis'd him to beware of him, taking hold of his Fleſh with his Hand, he ſaid, <hi>What? do ye think that</hi> Brutus <hi>will not wait out the time of this little Body?</hi> as if he thought none fit to ſucceed him in ſo great Power but only <hi>Brutus.</hi> And indeed it ſeems to be without doubt, that <hi>Brutus</hi> might have been the firſt Man in the Common-wealth, if he could have had patience but a little time to be ſecond to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> if he would have ſuffer'd his Power inſenſibly to decay after it was come to its higheſt pitch, and the fame of his great Actions to die and wither away by degrees. But <hi>Caſſius,</hi> a Man of a fierce Diſpoſition, and one that out of private Malice, rather than Love of the Publick, hated <hi>Caeſar,</hi> not the Tyrant, continually fir'd him and ſtirr'd him up. <hi>Brutus</hi> could not endure the Imperial Power, but <hi>Caſſius</hi> hated the Emperor: and among other Reaſons on which he grounded his Quarrel againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the loſs of his Lions, which he had procur'd when he was deſign'd <hi>Aedile,</hi> was not the leaſt, for theſe <hi>Caeſar</hi> finding in <hi>Megara,</hi> when that City was, taken by <hi>Calenus,</hi> ſeized to himſelf. (Theſe Beaſts, they ſay, were a great miſchief to the <hi>Megari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
                  <pb n="610" facs="tcp:36410:318"/>
for when their City was taking, they broke open the Lions Dens, and pull'd off their Chains, and let them looſe, that they might run upon the Enemy that was entring the City; but the Lions turn'd upon them themſelves, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wildly about, tore a great many of them to pieces, ſo that it was a miſerable ſpectacle even to their enemies to behold.) And this, ſome ſay, was the chief provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that ſtirr'd up <hi>Caſſius</hi> to conſpire againſt <hi>Caeſar;</hi> but they are much in the wrong: for <hi>Caſſius</hi> had from his Youth a natural Hatred and Rancour againſt the whole race of Tyrants, which he ſhew'd when he was but a Boy, and went to the ſame School with <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Sylla;</hi> for he ſpeaking great words among the Boys, and extolling the unlimited command of his Father <hi>Sylla, Caſſius</hi> roſe up, and ſtruck him two or three Boxes on the Ear: which when the Tutors and Relations of <hi>Fauſtus</hi> deſign'd to enquire into, and to proſecute, <hi>Pompey</hi> forbad them, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for both the Boys together, examin'd the matter himſelf. And <hi>Caſſius</hi> then is reported to have ſaid thus, <hi>Come on,</hi> Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus, <hi>dare to ſpeak before this man thoſe words, that provok'd me, that I may ſtrike you again as I did before.</hi> Such was the Diſpoſition of <hi>Caſſius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="611" facs="tcp:36410:318"/>
But <hi>Brutus</hi> by many Perſwaſions of his familiar Friends, and many Letters from unknown Citizens, was rouz'd up and puſh'd on to this Undertaking. For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Statue of his Anceſtor <hi>Brutus,</hi> that overthrew the Kingly Government, they writ theſe words, <hi>O that we had a</hi> Brutus <hi>now!</hi> And <hi>O that</hi> Brutus <hi>were alive!</hi> And <hi>Brutus</hi> his own Tribunal, on which he ſate as <hi>Praetor,</hi> was fill'd each Morning with ſuch Inſcriptions as theſe, <hi>You are aſleep</hi> Brutus; And, <hi>You are not a true</hi> Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. Now the Flatterers of <hi>Caeſar</hi> were the occaſion of all this, who among other invidious Honours which they ſtrove to faſten upon <hi>Caeſar,</hi> crown'd his Statues by night with an imperial Crown, with a deſign to ſtir up the People to ſalute him <hi>King</hi> inſtead of <hi>Dictator.</hi> But the quite contrary came to paſs, as I have more particularly ſhewn in the Life of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Caſſius</hi> went about ſolliciting Friends to engage in this Deſign againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> all whom he try'd, readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, if <hi>Brutus</hi> would be Head of the Conſpiracy; for their opinion was, that for this Enterprize they wanted not Hands or Reſolution, but the Reputation and Authority of a Man, ſuch as he was, to lead them on, and by his preſence
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:36410:319"/>
juſtifie the Undertaking: that without him they ſhould go about this Action with leſs heart, and ſhould lie under greater Suſpicions when they had done it; for if their Cauſe were juſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, they were ſure <hi>Brutus</hi> would not refuſe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſſius</hi> having conſider'd theſe things with himſelf, went to <hi>Brutus,</hi> and made him the firſt Viſit after their falling out; and after the Complements of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion paſs'd, and former Kindneſſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd between them, he ask'd him, if he deſign'd to be preſent at the Senate on the Calends of <hi>March,</hi> for it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd he ſaid, that <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Friends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended then to move that he might be made King.

               <p>Among thoſe of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Faction, there was one <hi>Caius Ligarius,</hi> whom <hi>Caeſar</hi> had pardon'd tho' accus'd for having been in Arms againſt him. This Man, not being ſo thankful for having been forgiven, as ſtomaching that Power which made him need a Pardon, hated <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but was one of <hi>Brutus</hi> his moſt intimate Friends. Him <hi>Brutus</hi> viſited and finding him ſick, <hi>O Lygarius,</hi> ſays he, <hi>what a time have you found out to be ſick in?</hi> At which words <hi>Ligarius</hi> raiſing himſelf and leaning on his Elbow, took <hi>Brutus</hi> by the Hand, and ſaid, <hi>But, O</hi> Brutus, <hi>if you are on any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign worthy of your ſelf, I am well.</hi> From this time they try'd the Inclinations of all their Acquaintance that they durſt truſt, and communicated the Secret to them, and took alſo into the Conſpiracy not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their familiar Friends, but as many as they believ'd bold and brave, and deſpiſers
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:36410:320"/>
of Death. For which Reaſon they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd the Plot from <hi>Cicero,</hi> tho' he was very much truſted, and as well belov'd by them all, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There were alſo two others that were Companions of <hi>Brutus; Statilius</hi> the <hi>Epicurean,</hi> and <hi>Favonius,</hi> a Follower of <hi>Cato,</hi> whom he left out of the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for this Reaſon: As he was diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one day with them at a diſtance, and propoſing ſome Queſtions to be diſputed of, as among Philoſophers, to try what opinion they were of, <hi>Favonius</hi> declar'd his Judgment to be, that a Civil War was worſe than the moſt unjuſt Tyranny: And <hi>Statilius</hi> held, that to bring himſelf into Troubles and Danger, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of evil or fooliſh men, did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a man that had any Wiſdom or Diſcretion. But <hi>Labeo,</hi> that was preſent, contradicted them both; and <hi>Brutus,</hi> as if it had been an intricate Diſpute, and difficult to be decided, held his peace for
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:36410:320"/>
that time; but afterwards diſcover'd the whole Deſign to <hi>Labeo,</hi> who readily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking it, the next thing that was thought convenient, was to gain the other <hi>Brutus,</hi> ſirnam'd <hi>Albinus,</hi> a man of himſelf of no great Bravery or Courage, but conſiderable for the number of Gladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators that he bred up for the publick Shews, and the great confidence that <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> put in him. When <hi>Caſſius</hi> and <hi>Labeo</hi> diſcours'd with him concerning this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he gave them no Anſwer; but meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Brutus</hi> himſelf alone, and finding that he was their Captain, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he readily conſented to partake in the Action, and the very Name of <hi>Brutus</hi> brought many others, and thoſe of the beſt Quality, over to the Conſpirators: who tho' they neither gave or took any Oath of Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, nor us'd any other ſacred Rite, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their Fidelity to each other, yet all kept their Deſign ſo cloſe, were ſo wary, and manag'd it ſo ſilently among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that tho' by Propheſies, and by wonderful Apparitions and Prodigies, and by the Entrails of ſacrific'd Beaſts, the Gods gave warning of the Conſpiracy, yet could it not be believ'd.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Brutus</hi> conſidering that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Men of all <hi>Rome</hi> for Virtue, Birth or Courage, depended wholly upon him,
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:36410:321"/>
and ſurveying with himſelf all the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers they were to encounter, ſtrove as much as poſſible, when abroad, to keep his uneaſineſs of Mind to himſelf, and compoſe his unquiet Thoughts; but at home, and eſpecially at Night, he was not the ſame Man, but ſometimes his working Care would make him ſtart out of his Sleep, and other times he was ſo taken up with Thoughts, and ſo perplex'd in his Mind, that his Wiſe that lay with him could not chooſe but take notice that he was full of unuſual Trouble, and had in Agitation ſome dangerous and difficult Affair. <hi>Porcia,</hi> as was before ſaid, was the Daughter of <hi>Cato;</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> tho' her Couſin-german, had marry'd her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry young, tho' not a Maid, but after the Death of her former Husband, by whom ſhe had one Son that was nam'd <hi>Bibulus;</hi> and there is a little Book call'd, <hi>The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs of</hi> Brutus, written by him, yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. This <hi>Porcia</hi> being addicted to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, a great lover of her Husband, and full of Courage and Prudence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd not to enquire into <hi>Brutus</hi> his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, before ſhe had made this tryal of her ſelf: She turn'd all her Attendants out of her Chamber, and taking a little Knife, ſuch as they uſe to cut Nails with, ſhe gave her ſelf a deep gaſh in the
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:36410:321"/>
Thigh, upon which follow'd a great Flux of Blood, and ſoon after violent pains, and a dangerous Fever, occaſion'd by the anguiſh of the Wound. Now when <hi>Brutus</hi> was mightily afflicted for her, ſhe in the heighth of all her pain ſpoke thus to him: <hi>I,</hi> Brutus, <hi>being the Daughter of</hi> Cato, <hi>was given to you in Marriage, not like a Concubine, to partake only in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Civilities of Bed and Board, but to bear a part in all your good and all your evil Fortunes: and for my part, when I look upon you, I find no Reaſon to repent the Match; but from me, what Evidence of my Love, what ſatisfaction can you receive, if I may not ſhare with you in bearing your moſt hidden Griefs, nor be admitted to any of your Counſels that require Secrecy and Truſt? I know very well that Women ſeem to be of too weak a Nature to be truſted with Secrets; but certainly,</hi> Brutus, <hi>a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Birth and Education, and a Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with the Good and Honourable, are of ſome force to the forming our Manners, and ſtrengthening our natural weakneſs. And I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can boaſt, that I am the Daughter of</hi> Cato, <hi>and the Wife of</hi> Brutus; <hi>in which two great Titles, tho' before I put too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle confidence, yet now I have try'd my ſelf, and find, that even againſt Grief and Pain it ſelf I am invincible.</hi> Which

words having ſpoke, ſhe ſhew'd him her Wound, and related to him the whole tryal that ſhe had made of her own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy: At which he being aſtoniſh'd, lifted up his Hands to Heaven, and begg'd the aſſiſtance of the Gods in his Enterprize, that he might live to be a Husband worthy of ſuch a Wife, as <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia.</hi> So having comforted his Wife, he left her.</p>
               <p>A Meeting of the Senate being appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at which it was generally believ'd that <hi>Caeſar</hi> would be preſent, the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators agreed to make uſe of that Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity: For then they might appear all together without ſuſpition; and beſides they had hopes that all the nobleſt and leading Men of the Common-wealth, that would be then aſſembled, as ſoon as the great Deed was done, would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately appear for them, and aſſert the common Liberty. The very Place too where the Senate was to meet, ſeem'd to be, by divine appointment, favourable to their purpoſe: it was a Porch, that had one Nich towards the Theatre, in which there ſtood a Statue of <hi>Pompey,</hi> erected to him by the Common-wealth, when it adorn'd that part of the City with the Portico's and the Theatre. To this place it was that the Senate was call'd
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:36410:322"/>
on the Ides of <hi>March;</hi> ſo that ſome God ſeem'd to bring <hi>Caeſar</hi> thither, to revenge upon him the Death of <hi>Pompey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as it was Day, <hi>Brutus</hi> taking with him a Dagger, which none but his Wife knew of, went abroad: the reſt met together at <hi>Caſſius</hi> his Houſe, and brought forth his Son, that was that day to put on the <hi>Manly Gown,</hi> as it was call'd, into the <hi>Forum;</hi> and from thence going all to <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Porch, ſtay'd there, and expected the coming of <hi>Caeſar</hi> to the Senate. Here it was chiefly that any one who had known what they had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, would have admir'd the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd Temper, and the ſteady Reſolution of theſe men, in the moſt dangerous Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; for many of them being <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> and by their Office oblig'd to judge and determine Cauſes, did not only hear calmly all that made any Application to them, or had any Suits depending before them, as if they were free from all other Thoughts, but decided Cauſes with as much Accuracy and Judgment, as they had heard them with Attention and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And when one Perſon refus'd to ſtand to the Award of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and with great Clamor and many Atteſtations ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd to <hi>Caeſar, Brutus</hi> looking round about him upon thoſe that were preſent,
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:36410:323"/>
ſaid, Caeſar <hi>does not hinder me, nor ſhall he hinder me from doing according to the Laws.</hi> Yet there were many unuſual Accidents that diſturb'd them, and by meer chance were thrown in their way: The firſt and chiefeſt was, The long ſtay of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> tho' the Day was far ſpent, and his being detain'd at home by his Wife, and forbidden by the Soothſayers to go forth upon ſome Defect that appear'd in his Sacrifice. Another was this, There came a Man up to <hi>Caſca,</hi> one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, and taking him by the Hand, <hi>You conceal'd,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the Secret from us, but</hi> Brutus <hi>has told me all.</hi> At which words when <hi>Caſca</hi> was ſurpriz'd, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid laughing, <hi>How come you to be ſo rich of a ſudden, that you ſhould ſtand to be choſen</hi> Aedile? So near was <hi>Caſca</hi> to have diſcover'd the Secret, being deceiv'd by the Ambiguity of the others Diſcourſe. Then <hi>Popilius Lena,</hi> a Senator, having ſaluted <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> very obliging<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whiſper'd them ſoftly in the Ear, and ſaid, <hi>My Wiſhes are with you, that you may accompliſh what you deſign, and I adviſe you to make no delay, for the thing is now no Secret.</hi> This ſaid, he parted, and left them in a great Conſternation, ſuſpecting that the Deſign had taken Vent. In the mean while there came one in all
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:36410:323"/>
haſt from <hi>Brutus</hi> his Houſe, and brought him News that his Wife was dead: For <hi>Porcia</hi> being extremely diſturb'd with Expectation of the Event, and not able to bear the greatneſs of her Cares, could ſcarce keep her ſelf within Doors; and at every little Noiſe or Voice ſhe heard, leaping forth, and ſtarting ſuddenly, like one of the mad Prieſteſſes of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> ask'd every one that came to the <hi>Forum,</hi> What <hi>Brutus</hi> was doing? and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſent one Meſſenger after another to enquire. At laſt, after long Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ſtrength of her Body could hold out no longer, but overcome with her Doubts and Fears, ſhe fainted away. She had not time to betake her ſelf to her Chamber, for as ſhe was ſitting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt her Women, a ſudden want of Spirits, and a great Stupidneſs ſeiz'd her, and her Colour chang'd, and her Speech was quite loſt. At this Sight her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men made a great and lamentable Out-cry, and many of the Neighbours run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to <hi>Brutus</hi> his Houſe, to know what was the matter, the Report was ſoon ſpread abroad that <hi>Porcia</hi> was dead; tho' ſhe recover'd in a little while, and came to her ſelf again. When <hi>Brutus</hi> receiv'd this News, he was extremely troubled, nor without Reaſon, yet was not ſo car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:36410:324"/>
away by his private Grief, as to neglect the publick Concern: for now News was brought that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, carry'd in a Sedan; for being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the ill Omens that attended his Sacrifice, he had determin'd to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take no Affairs of any great Importance that day, but to defer them till another time, pretending that he was ſick. As ſoon as he came out of his Sedan, <hi>Popi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Laena,</hi> he who but a little before had wiſh'd <hi>Brutus</hi> good Succeſs in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, coming up to him, diſcours'd a great while, with him, <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſtanding ſtill all the while, and ſeeming to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry attentive. The Conſpirators not being able to hear what he ſaid, but gueſſing, by what themſelves were conſcious of, that this Conference was the diſcovery of their Treaſon, were ſtrangely deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and looking upon one another, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed from each others Countenances, that they ſhould not ſtay to be taken, but ſhould all kill themſelves. And now when <hi>Caſſius</hi> and ſome others were laying hands upon their Daggers under their Robes, and were drawing them out, <hi>Brutus</hi> viewing narrowly the Looks and Geſture of <hi>Laena,</hi> and finding that he was earneſtly petitioning, and not accuſing, ſaid nothing, becauſe there were many
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:36410:324"/>
Starngers to the Conſpiracy mingled amongſt them, but with a chearful Countenance encourag'd <hi>Caſſius.</hi> And after a little while, <hi>Laena</hi> having kiſs'd <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Hand, went away, ſhewing plainly, that all his Diſcourſe was about ſome particular Buſineſs relating to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Now when the Senate was gone in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Place where they were to ſit, ſome of the Conſpirators got cloſe to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>'s Chair, pretending they had ſome Suit to make to him, and <hi>Caſſius</hi> turning his Face to <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Statue, is ſaid to have invok'd it, as if it had been ſenſible of his Prayers; <hi>Trebonius</hi> in the mean while drew <hi>Antony</hi> towards the Door, and kept him in Talk without the Court. <hi>Caeſar</hi> now enter'd, and the whole Senate roſe up to him: As ſoon as he was ſate down, they all ſeemingly very officious crowded round about him, and ſet <hi>Tulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Cimber,</hi> one of their own Number, to intercede in behalf of his Brother that was baniſh'd; they all joyn'd their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with his, and took <hi>Caeſar</hi> by the Hand, and kiſs'd his Head and his Breaſt. But he rejecting at firſt their Supplications, and afterwards, when he ſaw they would not deſiſt, violently riſing up, <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> with both Hands catch'd hold of his
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:36410:325"/>
Robe, and pull'd it off from his Shoulders, and <hi>Caſca</hi> that ſtood behind him, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Dagger, gave him the firſt, but a ſlight Wound, about the Shoulder. <hi>Caeſar</hi> preſently ſnatching hold of the Handle of the Dagger and crying out aloud in <hi>Latin, Villain</hi> Caſca <hi>what doſt thou?</hi> He in <hi>Greek</hi> calling to his Brother, bad him come and help Now being wounded by a great many Hands, and looking round about him to ſee if there was any way to eſcape, as ſoon as ever he ſpy'd <hi>Brutus</hi> with his Dagger drawn againſt him he let go <hi>Caſca</hi>'s Hand, that he had hold on, and covering his Head with his Robe, gave up his Body to the barbarous Murtherers. They ſo eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſs'd towards the Body, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Daggers were hacking together, that the Conſpirators cut one another; <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> porticularly receiv'd a Wound in his Hand, and all of them were beſmear'd with Blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caeſar</hi> being thus ſlain, <hi>Brutus</hi> ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping forth into the middle of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate-houſe, intended to have made a Speech, and call'd back, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd the Senators to ſtay; but they all frighted, ran away in great Diſorder, and there was a great Confuſion and Preſs of People about the Gate, tho'
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:36410:325"/>
none purſu'd or follow'd; for they had firmly reſolv'd to kill no Body beſides <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but to call and invite all the reſt to Liberty. It was indeed the opinion of all the others, when they conſulted about the Execution of their deſign, that it was neceſſary to cut off <hi>Antony</hi> with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> looking upon him as an inſolent Man, an affecter of Monarchy, and one that had gain'd a powerful Intereſt by his converſation and acquaintance in the Army. And this they urg'd the rather, becauſe at that time, to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Ambition and Haughtineſs of his Temper, there was added the Dignity of being Conſul and Collegue to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> But <hi>Brutus</hi> oppos'd this Counſel, inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt upon the Injuſtice of it, and afterwards giving them hopes that a great change might be worked in <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> For he did not deſpair, but that <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> being taken off, ſo honourable a Man and ſuch a Lover of Glory as <hi>Antony,</hi> ſtir'd up with Emulation of their great Attempt, would lay hold of this occaſion to be a joynt reſtorer with them, of the Liberty of his Countrey. Thus did <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> ſave <hi>Antony</hi>'s life, but he in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſternation put himſelf into a <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beian</hi> habit and fled. But <hi>Brutus</hi> and his Party betook themſelves to the Capitol,
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:36410:326"/>
and in their way ſhewing their hands all bloody, and their naked Swords, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming Liberty to the People. At the firſt all Places were fill'd with Lamentation, and the wild running too and fro occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by the ſudden ſurprize and paſſion that every one was in, made a great Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult in the City. But no other Murther following and no Man being ſpoil'd of his Goods, the Senators and many of the People took courage and went up to the Conſpirators in the <hi>Capitol:</hi> And a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude being gathered together, <hi>Brutus</hi> made an Oration to them very Popular, and proper for the State that affairs were then in. Therefore when they applauded his Speech and cry'd out to him to come down, they all took confidence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into the <hi>Forum;</hi> the reſt were promiſcuouſly mingled with one another; but many of the moſt eminent quality at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending <hi>Brutus,</hi> conducted him between them with great ſplendor from the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol,</hi> and placed him in the <hi>Roſtrum.</hi> At the Sight of <hi>Brutus</hi> the Rabble, though conſiſting of a confuſed mixture, and all diſpoſed to make a Tumult, were ſtruck with Reverence and expected what he would ſay, with order and with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: and when he began to ſpeak, heard him with all imaginable quiet and
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:36410:326"/>
attention. But that all were not pleas'd with this action, they plainly ſhow'd when <hi>Cinna</hi> beginning to ſpeak, and accuſe <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> they broke out into a ſudden rage, and rail'd at him in ſuch opprobrious Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that the Conſpirators thought fit again to withdraw to the <hi>Capitol.</hi> And there <hi>Brutus</hi> expecting to be beſieg'd, diſmiſt the moſt Eminent of thoſe that had accompanyed them thither, not thinking it juſt that they who were not partakers of the fact ſhould ſhare in the danger. But the next day the Senate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſembled in the Temple of <hi>Tellus,</hi> and <hi>Antony</hi> and <hi>Plancus</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made Orations to move the People to forget what was paſt, and to be mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reconcil'd, it was decreed, that the Conſpirators ſhou'd not only be put out of all fear or danger, but that the <hi>Conſuls</hi> ſhou'd take care of what Honours, and Dignities were proper to be confer'd upon them. After which done, the Senate broke up; and <hi>Antony</hi> having ſent his Son as an Hoſtage to the <hi>Capitol, Brutus</hi> and his Company came down, and mutual Salutes, and Invitations paſt between them and the whole Company that were gather'd together: <hi>Antony</hi> invited and entertain'd <hi>Caſſius, Lepidus</hi> did the ſame to <hi>Brutus,</hi> and the reſt were invited and
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:36410:327"/>
treated by others, as each of them had either acquaintance or friends, among the People.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as it was day, the Senate or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd thanks to <hi>Antony,</hi> for having ſtifled the beginning of a Civil War: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Brutus</hi> and his Aſſociates that were preſent receiv'd the thanks of the Senate, and had Provinces aſſign'd, and diſtributed among them. <hi>Crete</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to <hi>Brutus, Africa</hi> to <hi>Caſſius, Aſia</hi> to <hi>Trebonius, Bithynia</hi> to <hi>Cimber,</hi> and to the other <hi>Brutus,</hi> that part of <hi>Gallia,</hi> that lay about the River <hi>Po.</hi> After theſe things, they began to conſider of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Will, and the ordering of his Funeral; <hi>Antony</hi> deſir'd that the Will might be read, and that the Body ſhould not have a private or diſhonourable Interment, leſt that ſhould further exaſperate the People: This <hi>Caſſius</hi> violently oppos'd, but <hi>Brutus</hi> yeilded to it, and gave leave; in which he ſeems to have a ſecond time miſcarry'd: For as before in ſparing the Life of <hi>Antony,</hi> he could not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome blame from his Party, in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up a violent Enemy againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy; ſo now in ſuffering him to have the ordering of the Funeral, he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a total and irrecoverable Error. For firſt, it appearing by the Will, that <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
                  <pb n="629" facs="tcp:36410:327"/>
had bequeath'd to the <hi>Roman</hi> People three hundred Seſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>erces a Man, and given to the Publick his Gardens beyond <hi>Tyber,</hi> (where now the Temple of <hi>Fortune</hi> ſtands) the whole City was fir'd with a wonderful affection for him, and a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate ſenſe of the loſs of him. And afterwards when the Body was brought forth into the <hi>Forum; Antony,</hi> as the cuſtom was, making a Funeral Oration in the Praiſe of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and ſinding the multitude mov'd with his Speech, to ſtir them up yet farther to Compaſſion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded the bloody Garment of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſhew'd them in how many places it was pierced, and expoſed to their view the number of his Wounds. Now there was nothing to be ſeen but Confuſion, ſome cri'd out to kill the Murderers, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (as was formerly done when <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> was <hi>Tribune</hi> of the People) tore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Benches and Tables out of the Shops round about, and heaping them all together, built a great Funeral Pile, and having put the Body of <hi>Caeſar</hi> upon it, ſet it on fire. The place wherein this was done, was ſurrounded with a great many Temples and other conſecrated houſes, ſo that they ſeem'd to burn the Body in a kind of Sacred Solemnity: As ſoon as the fire flam'd out, the multitude flocking in,
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:36410:328"/>
ſome from one part, and ſome from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, ſnatched the brands that were half burnt out of the Pile, and ran about the City to fire the houſes of the Murderers of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> But they having before-hand well fortify'd themſelves eſcaped this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>There was a kind of a Poet, one <hi>Cinna,</hi> not at all concern'd in the guilt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, but on the contrary one of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>'s friends: This man dreamt that he was invited to Supper by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and that he deni'd to go, but that the Emperor entreated, and preſt him to it very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly; and at laſt taking him by the hand led him into a very deep and dark place, whither he was forc'd againſt his will to follow, in great Conſternation and Amazement. After this Viſion he had a Fever the moſt part of the Night, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs in the morning hearing that the body of <hi>Caeſar</hi> was to be carried forth to be Interr'd, he was aſhamed not to be preſent at the Solemnity; but came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and mingled himſelf with the People that was thus ſtirr'd up, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the Speech of <hi>Antony.</hi> The multitude perceiving him, and taking him not for that <hi>Cinna,</hi> (who indeed he was) but for him that a little before in a Speech to the People had reproach'd
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:36410:328"/>
and inveigh'd againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> fell upon him and tore him to peices. This Action chiefly, and the alteration that <hi>Antony</hi> had wrought, ſo alarm'd <hi>Brutus</hi> and his Party, that for their ſafety they retir'd from the City: The firſt ſtay they made was at <hi>Antium,</hi> with a deſign to return again as ſoon as the fury of the People had ſpent it ſelf and was abated; which they expected would ſoon and eaſily come to paſs, in an unſettled Multitude, apt to be carried away with ſuch ſudden, and impetuous Paſſion, eſpecially ſince they had the Senate ſo favourable to them: Which though it took no notice of thoſe that had torn <hi>Cinna</hi> to pieces, yet made a ſtrict ſearch, and apprehended in order to puniſhment thoſe that had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted the houſes of the Conſpirators. By this time alſo the People began to be diſſatisfied with <hi>Antony,</hi> who they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, was ſetting up a kind of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy for himſelf; they long'd for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of <hi>Brutus,</hi> whoſe Preſence they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and hop'd for at the Games, and Spectacles, which he, as <hi>Praetor,</hi> was to exhibit to the publick.

               <p>The City being now divided into two Factions, ſome betaking themſelves to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and others to <hi>Antony,</hi> the Soldiers ſelling themſelves, as it were, by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Out-cry, and going over to him that would give them moſt; <hi>Brutus</hi> began to deſpair of any good event of ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and reſolving to leave <hi>Italy,</hi> paſſed by land through <hi>Leucania,</hi> and came to <hi>Elea</hi> by the Sea-ſide. From hence it was thought convenient, that <hi>Porcia</hi> ſhould return to <hi>Rome;</hi> ſhe was overcome with grief to part from <hi>Brutus,</hi> but ſtrove as much as was poſſible to conceal it; but in ſpight of all her manly Reſolutions, a Picture which ſhe found there acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally betray'd it. The Story of it was that parting of <hi>Hector</hi> from <hi>Andromache,</hi> when he went to engage the <hi>Greeks,</hi> giving his young Son <hi>Aſtyanax</hi> into her Arms, and ſhe ſixing her Eyes upon him, with an earneſt and affectionate look. As ſoon as ſhe eſpy'd this Piece, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance it bore to her own concern, made her burſt out into Tears, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times a day ſhe walkt where that Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture hung to gaze at it, and weep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it. Upon this occaſion, when <hi>Acili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
                  <pb n="635" facs="tcp:36410:330"/>
one of <hi>Brutu</hi>'s Friends repeated out of <hi>Homer</hi> theſe Verſes, wherein <hi>Andromache</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Hector.</hi>
               </p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Be careful <hi>Hector,</hi> for with Thee my All,</l>
                  <l>My Father, Mother, Brother, Husband fall.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brutus</hi> ſmiling reply'd. But I muſt not anſwer <hi>Porcia,</hi> as <hi>Hector</hi> did <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mache.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mind you your Wheel, and to your Maids give Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For tho' the natural weakneſs of her body hinders her from acting what only the ſtrength of Men can perform, yet ſhe has a mind as valiant, and as active for the good of her Country as the beſt of us. This Relation is in the Memoirs of <hi>Brutus,</hi> written by <hi>Bibulus, Porcias</hi>'s Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brutus</hi> took Ship from hence, and ſail'd to <hi>Athens;</hi> where he was receiv'd by the People, with great demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of kindneſs, which they expreſſed in their loud Acclamations, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours that were decreed him by the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. He liv'd there with one that had been formerly his Gueſt, and was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Auditor of <hi>Theomneſtus</hi> the <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick,</hi> and <hi>Cratippus</hi> the <hi>Peripatetick,</hi> with whom he was ſo engaged in a Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:36410:331"/>
Converſation, that he ſeem'd to have laid aſide all thoughts of publick Buſineſs, and that he might be wholly at Leiſure for Study and Philoſophy. But all this while being unſuſpected he was ſecretly making preparation for War; in order to which he ſent <hi>Heroſtratus</hi> into <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi> to bring over the Commanders that were there to his ſide, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf careſs'd and won upon the Affections of all the young <hi>Roman</hi> Gentlemen, that were then Students at <hi>Athens.</hi> Of this number was <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Son, whom he every where highly extol'd, and ſaid, that <hi>Whether ſleeping or waking, he could not chooſe but admire a young Man of ſo great a Spirit, and ſuch a Hater of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At length he began to act openly, and to appear in publick Buſineſs; and being inform'd that there were ſeveral <hi>Roman</hi> Ships very richly Laded, that in their courſe from <hi>Aſia,</hi> were to touch at <hi>Athens,</hi> and that they were Commanded by one of his Friends; he went to meet him about <hi>Caryſtus:</hi> Finding him there, and having perſwaded him to deliver up the Ships, he made a very ſplendid En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, for it happen'd to be his Birth-day. Now when they came to drink ſomewhat briskly, and were making Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:36410:331"/>
for Victory <hi>to Brutus</hi> and <hi>Liberty to Rome, Brutus</hi> to animate them the more call'd for a larger Bowl, and holding it in his hand upon no occaſion or Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought on a ſudden pronounc'd aloud this Verſe.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Fate and <hi>Apollo</hi> againſt me Conſpire.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Some Hiſtorians write that in the laſt Battle which he fought at <hi>Philippi,</hi> the Word that he gave to the Soliers was <hi>Apollo,</hi> and from thence conclude that this ſudden unaccountable Exclamation of his was a Preſage of the great Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw that he ſuffered there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiſtius,</hi> the Commander of theſe Ships, at his parting gave him 500000 Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterces of the Mony that he was convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Italy.</hi> And all the Remains of <hi>Pompey's</hi> Army, which after their General's Defeat wandred about <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> readily, and joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joyn'd themſelves to <hi>Brutus.</hi> Beſides this he took from <hi>Cinna</hi> five hundred Horſe that he was carrying to <hi>Dolabella</hi> into <hi>Aſia.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he ſail'd to <hi>Demetrias,</hi> and there ſeiz'd a great quantity of Arms, that had been provided by the command of <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Caeſar</hi> for the <hi>Parthian</hi> War, and were now deſign'd to be ſent to <hi>Antony.</hi> Then was <hi>Macedonia</hi> put into his hands, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd up by <hi>Hortenſius</hi> the Pretor, and all
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:36410:332"/>
the Kings and Potentates round about willingly offer'd themſelves to joyn with him. When news was brought that <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the Brother of <hi>Antony</hi> having paſſed through <hi>Italy,</hi> was marched on directly to joyn the Forces that <hi>Gabinius</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> and <hi>Apollonia. Brutus</hi> deſign'd to prevent him, and to ſeize them firſt, and in all haſte mov'd forwards with thoſe that he had about him; his march was very difficult, through rugged places, and in a great Snow, but ſo ſwift, that he had left thoſe that were to bring his Proviſions a great way behind. And now being very near to <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> with wearineſs and cold, he fell into a Diſtemper call'd <hi>Bulimia,</hi> or Violent Hunger: This is a Diſeaſe that ſeizes both Men and Cattle, after much labour, and eſpecially in a great Snow: Whether it is caus'd by the natural Heat, which when the Body is ſeized with cold, is forc'd all inwards and ſuddenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes all the Nouriſhment laid in; or whether the ſharp and ſubtil Vapour, which comes from the Snow as it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, cuts the body, as it were, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the Heat, which is thence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed throw the Pores; for the Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which are frequent in this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſeem to ariſe from the Heat metting
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:36410:332"/>
with the cold, and being quencht by it, in the Superficies of the Body. But of this I have in another place diſcourſed more at large. <hi>Brutus</hi> growing very faint, and there being none in the whole Army that had any thing for him to eat, his Servants were forc'd to have recourſe to the Enemy, and going as far as to the very Gates of the City, begg'd Bread of the Sentinels that were upon Duty. As ſoon as they heard of the ſad Eſtate of <hi>Brutus,</hi> they came themſelves, and brought both Meat and Drink along with them; for which act of Humanity <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> when he took the City, ſhew'd all Kindneſs and Civility, not to them only, but to all the reſt of the inhabitants for their Sakes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caius Antonius</hi> being now arriv'd at <hi>Apollonia,</hi> ſummon'd all the Soldiers that were near that City to joyn him there; but finding that they nevertheleſs went all to <hi>Brutus.</hi> and ſuſpecting that even thoſe of <hi>Apollonia,</hi> were enclin'd to the ſame Party, he quitted that City, and come to <hi>Buthrotus;</hi> having firſt loſt three Companies of his Men, that in their march thither, were cut to pieces by <hi>Brutus.</hi> After this he attempting to make himſelf Maſter of ſome ſtrong places, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Byllis,</hi> which the Enemy had firſt
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:36410:333"/>
ſeiz'd; he was overcome in a ſet Battle by young <hi>Cicero,</hi> to whom <hi>Brutus</hi> gave the Command of the Army that day, and whoſe Conduct he made uſe of often, and with great Succeſs. <hi>Caius Antonius</hi> was ſurpriz'd in a Marſhy Place, from whence he could not retire; and <hi>Brutus</hi> having him in his Power, would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his own Soldiers to fall upon thoſe of the Enemy; but encompaſſing them with his Horſe, gave command that none of them ſhould be kill'd, for that in a little time they would all be of his ſide; which accordingly came to paſs, for they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred both themſelves and their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: So that <hi>Brutus</hi> had by this time a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great and conſiderable Army. He ſhew'd all Marks of Honour and Eſteem to <hi>Caius Antonius</hi> for a long time, nor took any of his Titles or Dignities away, tho' as ſome report he had ſeveral Letters from <hi>Rome,</hi> and particularly from <hi>Cicero,</hi> adviſing him to put him to Death. But at laſt <hi>Brutus</hi> perceiving that he began to hold private Conſults, and corrupt his Officers, and was raiſing a ſedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Soldiers he put him aboard a Ship, and kept him cloſe Priſoner. In the mean time the Soldiers that had been corrupted by <hi>Caius,</hi> had retir'd to <hi>Apollonia,</hi> and ſent word to <hi>Brutus,</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:36410:333"/>
him to come to them thither. He anſwer'd that this was not the cuſtom of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but that it became thoſe who had offended to come themſelves to their General, and beg forgiveneſs of their Crimes; which they did and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly receiv'd their Pardon.</p>
               <p>As he was preparing to paſs into <hi>Aſia,</hi> there was an account brought to him of the Alteration that had happen'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> where the young <hi>Caeſar</hi> aſſiſted by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, in oppoſition to <hi>Antony,</hi> was got into great Power. And having now thrown his Competitor out of <hi>Italy,</hi> began himſelf to be very formidable: Suing for the Conſulſhip contrary to Law, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a great Army, of which the Common-wealth had no manner of need. At length perceiving that the Senate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with his Proceedings, began to caſt their Eyes abroad upon <hi>Brutus,</hi> and decreed and confirm'd the Government of ſeveral Provinces to him, he was in ſome apprehenſion of danger. Therefore diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching Meſſengers to <hi>Antony,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd that there might be a Reconciliation, and a ſtrict Friendſhip between them. Then drawing all his Forces about the City he made himſelf be choſen Conſul, tho' he was but very young, being ſcarce Twenty years old, as he himſelf writes in
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:36410:334"/>
his Commentaries. At his firſt entry upon the Conſulſhip he immediately or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd a Judicial Proceſs to be iſſu'd out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Brutus,</hi> and his Accomplices, for having Murther'd the greateſt Man, and the higheſt Magiſtrate of <hi>Rome,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being heard or condemn'd; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed L. <hi>Cornificius</hi> to accuſe <hi>Brutus,</hi> and M. <hi>Agrippa</hi> to accuſe <hi>Caſſius.</hi> None appearing to Plead their Cauſe, the Judges were forc'd to paſs Sentence and condemn them both. It is reported, that when the Cryer (as the cuſtom was) with a loud voice cited <hi>Brutus</hi> to appear, the People could not keep in their ſighs, and thoſe of the beſt quality hung down their Heads for Grief. <hi>Publius Silicius</hi> was ſeen to burſt out into Tears, which was the cauſe that not long after he was put down in the Liſt of thoſe that were <hi>Proſcrib'd.</hi> Now the <hi>Triumviri, Caeſar, Antony</hi> and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> being perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd ſhar'd the Provinces among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and made up the Catalogue of Proſcription wherein were ſet down thoſe that were deſign'd for Slaughter, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to two hundred Men, to which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Cicero</hi> was ſlain. This news be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to <hi>Brutus</hi> in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> he was forc'd to ſend orders in <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> that he ſhould kill <hi>Caius Antonius,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:36410:334"/>
of the Death of <hi>Cicero</hi> his Friend, and <hi>Decius Brutus</hi> his near Kinſman, who alſo was proſcrib'd and ſlain. Upon this account it was that <hi>Antony</hi> having after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards taken <hi>Hortenſius</hi> in the Battle of <hi>Philippi,</hi> Slew him upon his Brothers Tomb. But <hi>Brutus</hi> expreſs'd himſelf more aſham'd for the cauſe of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s death, than griev'd for the misfortune of it, and could not help accuſing his friends at <hi>Rome,</hi> that they were Slaves more through their own Fault, than thoſe that Lorded over them: That could ſee and be preſent, and yet ſuffer thoſe things, which even to hear related, ought to them to have been inſufferable.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Brutus</hi> having made his Army, that was already very conſiderable, paſs into <hi>Aſia;</hi> order'd a Fleet to be made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in <hi>Bythinia,</hi> and <hi>Cyzicum</hi> for them to imbark in: But himſelf going the way by Land, took care to ſettle and confirm to himſelf all the Cities, and gave Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Princes of the Parts, through which he paſt; and ſent orders to <hi>Caſſius</hi> into <hi>Syria</hi> to come to him, and leave his intended Journey into <hi>Aegypt;</hi> letting him underſtand that it was not to gain an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire for themſelves, but to free their Country, that they went thus wandring about, and had got an Army together,
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:36410:335"/>
whoſe buſineſs it was to deſtroy Tyrants: That therefore, if they remembred and reſolv'd to perſevere in their firſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they ought not to be too far from <hi>Italy,</hi> but to make what haſt they could thither, and endeavour to relieve their fellow-Citizens from Oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſſius</hi> obey'd his Summons, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd; and <hi>Brutus</hi> went to meet him: And at <hi>Smyrna</hi> they both met; which was the firſt time they had ſeen one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſince they parted at the <hi>Piraeum</hi> in <hi>Athens;</hi> one for <hi>Syria,</hi> and the other for <hi>Macedonia.</hi> They were both over-joy'd, and rais'd to the higheſt degree of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of their Succeſs, from the Forces that each of them had got together: Since they who had fled from <hi>Italy,</hi> like the moſt deſpicable Exiles, without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, without Arms, without a Ship, or a Soldier, or a City to rely on, in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time after had met together, ſo well furniſh'd with Shipping and Money, and an Army both of Horſe and Foot, that they were in a condition to contend for the Empire of <hi>Rome. Caſſius</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ſhew as much Reſpect and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to <hi>Brutus,</hi> as <hi>Brutus</hi> did to him: But <hi>Brutus</hi> ſtill prevented him, for the moſt part coming to him, both becauſe he was the elder Man, and of a more
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:36410:335"/>
weak Conſtitution than himſelf. Men generally reckon'd <hi>Caſſius</hi> a very expert Soldier, but of a harſh and angry Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and one that deſir'd to Command rather by fear than love; though on the other ſide among his Familiar Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance he was given to ſcurrillous Jeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and lov'd to play the Buffoon. But <hi>Brutus,</hi> for the ſake of his Vertue, was eſteem'd by the People, belov'd by his Friends, admir'd by the beſt Men, and hated by none, no, not his Enemies themſelves: For he was a Man of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary mild Nature, of a great Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, inſenſible of the Paſſions of Anger, or Pleaſure, or Covetouſneſs; ſteady and inflexible in his Opinion, and zealous for what ever he thought right and honeſt. And that which gain'd him the greateſt Credit and Reputation among the People, was their belief, that his deſigns in this whole Undertaking were honourable and juſt. For they could not hope, that even <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great himſelf, if he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome <hi>Caeſar,</hi> would have ſubmitted his Power to the Laws, but would have ever managed the Publick Affairs himſelf; only ſoothing the People with the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous name of <hi>Conſul</hi> or <hi>Dictator,</hi> or ſome other milder Title than King.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="646" facs="tcp:36410:336"/>
But they thought that <hi>Caſſius,</hi> being a Man govern'd by Anger and Paſſion, and carried often by his covetous Humour beyond the bounds of Juſtice; endur'd all theſe hardſhips of War, and Travel, and Danger, rather to obtain Dominion to himſelf, than Liberty to the People. And as for the former diſturbers of the Peace of <hi>Rome,</hi> whether a <hi>Cinna,</hi> a <hi>Marius,</hi> or a <hi>Carbo,</hi> it is manifeſt that they having ſet their Country as a ſtake for him that ſhould win, did almoſt own in expreſs terms, that they ſought for Empire. But even the Enemies of <hi>Brutus</hi> can't lay this accuſation to his charge: Nay, many have heard <hi>Antony</hi> himſelf ſay, <hi>That</hi> Brutus <hi>was the only Man that Conſpir'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Caeſar, <hi>out of a ſence of the Glory and Juſtice of the Action; but that all the reſt roſe up againſt the</hi> MAN, <hi>and not the</hi> TYRANT: <hi>from private Envy and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of their own.</hi> And it is plain, that <hi>Brutus</hi> (by what he writes himſelf) did not ſo much rely upon his Forces, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own Vertue: For thus he ſpeaks in his Epiſtle to <hi>Atticus,</hi> immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was to engage with the Enemy. <hi>That his Affairs were in the beſt ſtate of Fortune that he could wiſh; for that either he ſhould overcome, and reſtore Liberty to the People of</hi> Rome, <hi>or die, and be himſelf
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:36410:336"/>
free from Slavery. That other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreed upon and ſettled, one thing was yet in doubt, whether they ſhould live or die Free Men.</hi> He adds further, <hi>That</hi> Marc Anthony <hi>had receiv'd a juſt Puniſhment for his Folly, who when he might have been numbred with</hi> Brutus, <hi>and</hi> Caſſius, <hi>and</hi> Cato, <hi>would joyn himſelf to</hi> Octavius: <hi>That though they ſhould not now be both overcome, they ſoon would fight among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> And in this he ſeems to have been no ill Prophet. Now, when they were at <hi>Smyrna, Brutus</hi> deſir'd <hi>Caſſius</hi> that he might have part of the great Treaſure that <hi>Caſſius</hi> had heaped up, becauſe all his own was expended in furniſhing out ſuch a Fleet of Ships as was ſufficient to keep all the Sea in their Power. But <hi>Caſſius</hi>'s Friends diſſwaded him from this; for, ſaid they, it is not juſt that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which you with ſo much Parſimony keep, and with ſo much Envy have got, ſhould be given to him, to be diſpoſed of in making himſelf Popular, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the favour of the Soldiers. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, <hi>Caſſius</hi> gave him a third part of all that he had; and then they parted each to their ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. <hi>Caſſius</hi> having taken <hi>Rhodes,</hi> behav'd himſelf there with very great Cruelty; though at his firſt entry, when
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:36410:337"/>
ſome had called him <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>King;</hi> he anſwer'd, that he was neither <hi>King</hi> nor <hi>Lord,</hi> but the Deſtroyer and Puniſher of a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lord. Brutus,</hi> on the other part, ſent to the <hi>Lycians,</hi> to demand from them a ſupply of Money and Men; but <hi>Naucrates,</hi> a Popular Man among them, perſwaded the City to Rebel; ſo that ſome of the Country poſſeſs'd themſelves of ſeveral little Mountains and Hills, with a deſign to hinder <hi>Brutus</hi>'s paſſage: <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> at firſt, ſent out a party of Horſe, which ſurprizing them at Dinner, kill'd 600 of them; and afterwards, having taken all their ſmall Towns and Villages round about, he ſet all his Priſoners free without Ranſom; hoping to win the whole Nation by his Clemency. But they continued obſtinate; fill'd with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for what they had ſuffer'd, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing his Goodneſs and Humanity; till <hi>Brutus,</hi> having forc'd the moſt warlike of them into the City of <hi>Xanthus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged them there. Several endeavour'd to make their eſcape by ſwimming and diving under the River, but were taken by Nets for that purpoſe let down, which had little Bells at the top, which gave preſent notice of any that was taken in them. The <hi>Xanthians</hi> after that, made a Sally in the Night, and ſeizing ſeveral
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:36410:337"/>
of the Battering Engines, ſet them on fire; but being ſoon perceiv'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> were beaten back to their Wall; and there being a very violent Wind, it forc'd the flames to the Battlements of the City with ſuch fierceneſs, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the adjoyning Houſes took fire. But <hi>Brutus,</hi> fearing leſt the whole City ſhould be deſtroyed, commanded his own Soldiers to aſſiſt thoſe of the City, and to quench the fire. But the <hi>Lycians</hi> were on a ſudden poſſeſs'd with a ſtrange and incredible deſpair; ſuch a Frenzy which cannot be better expreſt, than by calling it a violent deſire to die; for both Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children, the Bond-men and the Free, thoſe of all Ages, and of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, ſtrove to force away the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that came in to their Aſſiſtance from the Walls; and themſelves gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together Reeds and Wood, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever combuſtible matter they could, ſpread the fire over the whole City, feeding it with whatever fuel they could, and by all poſſible means exciting its fury; ſo that the flame having diſpers'd it ſelf, and encircled the whole City, blaz'd out in ſo terrible a manner, that <hi>Brutus</hi> being extremely afflicted at their Calamity, got himſelf on Horſe-back, and rid round the Walls, earneſtly deſirous to preſerve
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:36410:338"/>
the City; and ſtretching forth his hands to the <hi>Xanthians,</hi> begg'd of them, that they would ſpare themſelves, and ſave their Town. Yet none regarded his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, but by all manner of ways ſtrove to deſtroy themſelves; not only Men and Women, but even Boys and little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, with a hideous out-cry ſome leap'd into the fire, others threw themſelves from the Walls, others fell upon their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Swords, opening their breaſts, and deſiring to be ſlain. After the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the City, there was found a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had hanged her ſelf, with her young Child hanging from her Neck, and the Torch in her hand with which ſhe had fired her own Houſe: It was ſo Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical a ſight, that <hi>Brutus</hi> could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to ſee it, but wept at the very rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; and proclaim'd a Reward to any Souldier that could ſave a <hi>Xanthian.</hi> And it is ſaid, that an hundred and fifty only were preſerv'd, and that too againſt their wills. Thus the <hi>Xanthians,</hi> after a long ſpace of years, the fatal period of their Deſtruction being, as it were, accompliſh'd, by their deſperate Courage, reviv'd the memory of the Calamity of their fore-fathers, who after the very ſame manner in the <hi>Perſian</hi> War had fir'd their City, and deſtroyed themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="651" facs="tcp:36410:338"/>
                  <hi>Brutus,</hi> after this, finding the <hi>Pata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> reſolv'd to make reſiſtance, and hold out their City againſt him, was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to beſiege it; and was in great perplexity leſt the ſame Frenzy might ſeize them too. But having in his power ſome of their Women Captives, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd them all without any Ranſom; who returning, and giving an account to their Husbands and Fathers, who were of the greateſt Quality, what an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Man <hi>Brutus</hi> was; how Sober, how Temperate, and how Juſt, perſwaded them to yield themſelves, and put their City into his hands. From this time, all the Cities round about came in to his Power, ſubmitting themſelves to him, and found him gracious and merciful, even beyond their hopes. For though <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> at the ſame time had compell'd the <hi>Rhodians</hi> to bring in all the Silver and Gold that each of 'em privately was Maſter of; by which he rais'd a Sum of eight thouſand Talents, and beſides that, condemn'd the Publick to pay the Sum of five hundred Talents more. Yet <hi>Brutus,</hi> not having taken above a hundred and fifty Talents from the <hi>Lycians,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done them no other manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, parted from thence with his Army to <hi>Ionia.</hi> Through the whole courſe of
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:36410:339"/>
this Expedition, <hi>Brutus</hi> did many memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Acts of Juſtice, in diſpenſing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments to ſuch as had deſerved either: One of which I will relate, becauſe he himſelf, and all the Nobility of <hi>Rome</hi> were pleas'd with it above all the reſt. When <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, being overthrown by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> had fled to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and landed near <hi>Peluſium,</hi> the Protectors of the young King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted among themſelves, what was fit to be done on that Occaſion, nor could all agree in the ſame Opinion; ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for receiving him, others for driving him from <hi>Aegypt:</hi> But <hi>Theodotus,</hi> a <hi>Chian</hi> by birth, and a Mercenary Teacher of Rhetorick, then attending upon the King, and for want of better Men, being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Council, undertook to convince 'em, that both Parties were in the wrong; thoſe that counſell'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Pompey,</hi> and thoſe that advis'd to ſend him away: That in their preſent caſe, one thing only was neceſſary, to ſeize him, and to ſlay him; and ended his Speech with the Proverb, <hi>That dead Men don't bite.</hi> The Council agreed to his Opinion, and <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great (an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of incredible and un-foreſeen E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents) was ſlain; and ſlain by the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick and Eloquence of <hi>Theodotus,</hi> as
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:36410:339"/>
that Sophiſter himſelf had the impudence to boaſt. Not long after, when <hi>Caeſar</hi> came to <hi>Aegyt,</hi> ſome of the Murtherers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd their juſt Reward, and were put to death, as they deſerv'd. But <hi>Theodotus,</hi> though he had gain'd from Fortune a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time for a poor deſpicable and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Life; yet could not lye hid from <hi>Brutus,</hi> as he paſs'd through <hi>Aſia;</hi> but being ſeiz'd by him, and executed, had his Death made more memorable than his Life.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Brutus</hi> ſent to <hi>Caſſius,</hi> to come to him at the City of <hi>Sardis;</hi> and, when he was on his Journey, went forth with his friends to meet him; and the whole Army being in array, ſaluted each of them with the Name of Emperour. Now (as it uſually happens in buſineſs of great concern, and wherein many Friends, and many Commanders are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd) ſeveral Jealouſies of each other, and private Accuſations having paſs'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> they reſolv'd, before they entred upon any other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, immediately to withdraw into ſome private Apartment; where the Door be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhut, and they two alone, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan firſt to expoſtulate, then to diſpute hotly, and accuſe each other; after that from the liberty of ſpeech and
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:36410:340"/>
hard words, that paſs'd between them, they were tranſported into Paſſion, and at laſt burſt out into Tears. Their Friends, who ſtood without, were amaz'd, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them loud and angry, and fear'd leſt ſome miſchief might follow, but yet durſt not interrupt them, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not to enter the Room. But <hi>Marcus Favonius,</hi> one that had been a follower of <hi>Cato,</hi> and not ſo much for his Reaſon or Wiſdom, as for his wild and frantick Carriage, would paſs for a Philoſopher, was ruſhing in upon them, but was hindred by the Attendants; but it was a hard matter to ſtop <hi>Favonius,</hi> where ever his wildneſs hurried him; for he was fierce and violent in all his behaviour: And though he was a Senator, yet thinking that one of the leaſt of his Excellencies, he valued himſelf more upon a ſort of <hi>Cynical</hi> liberty of ſpeaking what he pleas'd; which ſometimes was diverting enough to thoſe that would interpret in jeſt his importunate ſcurrility. This <hi>Favonius</hi> breaking by force through thoſe that kept the Doors, entred into the Chamber, and with a mimical voice pronounc'd this Verſe that <hi>Homer</hi> makes <hi>Neſtor</hi> uſe:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Be rul'd, for I am elder than you both.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>
                  <pb n="655" facs="tcp:36410:340"/>
This made <hi>Caſſius</hi> laugh; but <hi>Brutus</hi> thruſt him out, calling him impudent and counterfeit <hi>Cynick;</hi> But yet for the preſent this put an end to their Diſpute, and they both parted. <hi>Caſſius</hi> made a Supper that Night, and <hi>Brutus</hi> invited his Friends thither; when they were ſat down, <hi>Favonius</hi> having bath'd, came in among them; <hi>Brutus</hi> call'd out aloud, and told him, that he was not invited, and bid him go ſit at the lower end of the Table: But he violently thruſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in, and ſat down in the middle, where he diverted the whole Company all the time of their Entertainment with Drollery and Philoſophy. The next day after, upon the accuſation of the <hi>Sardians, Brutus</hi> publickly diſgraced and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Lucius Pella,</hi> one that had been <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and employ'd in Offices of Truſt by himſelf, for having embezell'd the Publick Money. This Action did not a little vex <hi>Caſſius;</hi> for, but a few days before, two of his own Friends, being accus'd of the ſame Crime, he only in private admoniſh'd them; but in publick abſolv'd them, and continued them in their Office; and upon this occaſion he accus'd <hi>Brutus</hi> of too much rigour and ſeverity of Juſtice, in a time which required them to uſe more gentleneſs and favour. In
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:36410:341"/>
Anſwer to this, <q>
                     <hi>Brutus</hi> bid him remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the <hi>Ides of March</hi> (the day when they kill'd <hi>Caeſar)</hi> who himſelf did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vex nor grieve all Mankind, but was only the ſupport and ſtrength of thoſe that did; he bid him conſider, that if there was any colour for Juſtice to be neglected, it had been better to have ſuffered the injuſtice of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Friends, than to give impunity to their own; for then, ſaid he, we could have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd of Cowardiſe only; whereas now we are liable to the accuſation of Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, after all our pain and dangers which we endure:</q> By which we may perceive what was <hi>Brutus</hi>'s purpoſe, and the Rule of all his Actions.</p>
               <p>About the time that they had deſign'd to paſs out of <hi>Aſia</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> it was ſaid, that a wonderfull Apparition was ſeen by <hi>Brutus.</hi> He was naturally given to much Watching, and being us'd to great mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in his Diet, and having perpetual Employment, he allow'd but a very ſmall portion of time for ſleep: He never ſlept in the day time, and in the Night then only when all his buſineſs was finiſh'd, and when every one elſe being gone to reſt, he had no body to diſcourſe with him. But at this time the War being begun, having the whole ſtate of it to
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:36410:341"/>
conſider of; and being very careful and ſollicitous of the Event, after his firſt ſleep, which he took moderately juſt after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he ſpent all the reſt of the Night in managing his moſt urgent Affairs; which if he had diſpatch'd in time, he employed himſelf in Reading, till the third Watch; at which time the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions and Tribunes were uſed o come to him for Orders. Thus one Night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he paſſed out of <hi>Aſia,</hi> he was very late all alone in his Tent, with a dim Light burning by him, all the reſt of the Army being huſht and ſilent; and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with himſelf, and very thoughtful, as he turn'd his Eye to the Door, he ſaw a terrible and ſtrange Appearance of a prodigious and frightful Body coming towards him without ſpeaking. <hi>Brutus</hi> boldly ask'd it, <hi>What art thou? Man or God? Or, upon what Buſineſs doſt thou come to us?</hi> The Spirit anſwered, <hi>I am thy Evil Genius,</hi> Brutus: <hi>Thou ſhalt ſee me at</hi> Philippi. To which, <hi>Brutus,</hi> not at all diſturb'd, replied, <hi>Then I will ſee thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Apparition vaniſh'd, he call'd his Servants to him, who all told him, that they had neither heard any Voice, nor ſeen any Viſion: From that time he continued watching, till the
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:36410:342"/>
Morning; and then went to <hi>Caſſius,</hi> and related to him the Apparition he had ſeen. He being bred up in the Principles of <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s Philoſophy, and being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten us'd to diſpute with <hi>Brutus</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Matters of this Nature, ſpoke to him thus, upon this Occaſion: <hi>Brutus, It is the Opinion of our Sect, that all that we feel or ſee, is not real and true; but that our Senſe is a moſt ſlippery and deceitful thing: The Mind, which is more quick and ſubtile, moves and varies That into all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Idea's, which have no real exiſtence in Nature, as readily as we imprint any form upon Wax; ſo that it is eaſie for the Soul of Man, which has in it ſelf both that which forms, and that which is formed, to vary it into what ſhapes it pleaſes. This is evident from the ſudden changes of our Dreams, in which the imagination, upon very ſlight Principles, repreſents to us all ſorts of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Soul, and appearances of things; for it is the nature of the Mind to be in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual motion, and that motion is our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and Thought: But beſides all this, in your caſe, the Body being tir'd and worn out with continual labours and cares, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally works upon the Mind, and keeps it in ſuſpence and trouble. But that there ſhould be any ſuch thing as Daemons or Spirits, or if there were, that they ſhould have humane
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:36410:342"/>
ſhape, or voice, or power, that can reach to us, is altogether improbable; though I confeſs I could wiſh that there were ſuch Beings, that we might not rely upon our Arms only, and our Horſes, and our Navy all which are ſo great and powerful, but might be confident of the aſſiſtance of the Gods alſo in this our moſt Sacred and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Attempt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With ſuch Diſcourſes as theſe, <hi>Caſſius</hi> in ſome manner ſettled and compoſed the mind of <hi>Brutus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Army began to march from whence they were encamped, two Eagles flew to them, and lighted on the two firſt Enſigns, and continually fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Souldiers, and were fed by them, till they came to <hi>Philippi,</hi> and there but one day before the Fight, they both flew away. <hi>Brutus</hi> had already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced moſt of the Places and People of theſe Parts; but he marched on as far as to the Coaſts of <hi>Thaſſos,</hi> that if there were any City, or Man of Power, that yet ſtood out, he might force them all to Subjection. In theſe Parts <hi>Norbanus</hi> was encamped, in a Place called <hi>The Streights,</hi> near <hi>Symbolon:</hi> Him they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded in ſuch ſort, as they forc'd him to diſlodge and quit the Place; and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus</hi> narrowly eſcaped loſing his whole
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:36410:343"/>
Army; <hi>Caeſar,</hi> by reaſon of his Sickneſs being left behind: For he had certainly been loſt, had not <hi>Antony</hi> arrived to his Relief with ſuch wonderful ſwiftneſs, that <hi>Brutus</hi> could not believe that he was come. <hi>Caeſar</hi> came up to the Army ten days after. <hi>Brutus</hi> was encamped over againſt him, and <hi>Caſſius</hi> over againſt <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony.</hi> The ſpace between the two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, is called by the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Fields of <hi>Philippi.</hi> Never did two ſo great <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Armies appear together ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage each other. The Army of <hi>Brutus</hi> was ſomewhat leſs in number than that of <hi>Caeſar:</hi> But in the ſplendidneſs of their Arms, and richneſs of their Equipage, it did wonderfully exceed; for moſt of their Arms were of Gold and Silver, which <hi>Brutus</hi> had laviſhly beſtow'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: For though in other things <hi>Brutus</hi> had accuſtomed his Commanders to uſe all Frugality and Moderation, yet he thought that the Riches which Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers carried about them in their Hands, and on their Bodies, would ſtir up the Ambition of thoſe that were deſirous of Glory; and make thoſe that were cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and lovers of Gain, fight the more valiantly to preſerve their Arms, which were their Eſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="661" facs="tcp:36410:343"/>
                  <hi>Caeſar</hi> made a View and Luſtration of his Army within his Trenches, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed only a little Corn, and but five Drachma's to each Souldier for their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice they were to make. But <hi>Brutus,</hi> either pitying this poverty, or diſdaining this meanneſs of Spirit in <hi>Caeſar,</hi> firſt, as the Cuſtom was, made a general Muſter and Luſtration of his Army in the open Field, and then diſtributed a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Beaſts for Sacrifice to every Band, and fifty Drachma's to every Souldier: So that in the Love of his Souldiers, and their readineſs to fight for him, <hi>Brutus</hi> had much the advantage of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> But at the time of Luſtration, it is reported, that an unlucky Omen happened to <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius;</hi> for one of his Officers preſenting him with a Garland, that he was to wear at Sacrifice, gave it him with the in-ſide outward: Farther, it is ſaid, That ſome time before, at a certain ſolemn Proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Golden Image of Victory, which was carried before <hi>Caſſius,</hi> fell down by a ſlip of him that carried it. Beſides this, there appear'd many Birds of Prey daily about the Camp; and ſeveral ſwarms of Bees were ſeen in a place within the Trenches, which Place the South-ſayers ordered to be ſhut out from the Camp, to remove the Superſtition which inſenſibly
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:36410:344"/>
began to prevail with even <hi>Caſſius</hi> himſelf, in ſpight of his <hi>Epicurean</hi> Philoſophy, but had wholly inſected and ſubdued the Souldiers: From whence it was that <hi>Caſſius</hi> was very unwilling to put all to the hazard of a preſent Battel; but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed rather to draw out the War till far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time; conſidering that they were ſtronger in Money and Proviſions, but in the number and Men, inferiour. But <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> on the contrary, was ſtill, as formerly, deſirous to come with all ſpeed to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of a Battel; that ſo he might either reſtore his Country to her Liberty, or elſe deliver from their Miſery all thoſe Men that he had haraſs'd with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, and the troubles and dangers of the War. And finding alſo his Light-Horſe, in ſeveral Skirmiſhes, ſtill to have had the better, he was the more encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and reſolved: And ſome of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers having deſerted, and gone to the Enemy, and others beginning to accuſe and ſuſpect one another, many of <hi>Caſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s Friends in the Council chang'd their Opinions to that of <hi>Brutus.</hi> But there was one of <hi>Brutus</hi>'s Party, named <hi>Atel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> who oppos'd his Reſolution, adviſing rather that they ſhould tarry till the next Winter. And when <hi>Brutus</hi> ask'd him, <hi>In how much better a Condition he hoped
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:36410:344"/>
to be a Year after?</hi> His Anſwer was, <hi>If I gain nothing elſe, yet I ſhall live ſo much the longer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſſius</hi> was much diſpleaſed at this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; and among all the reſt, <hi>Atellius</hi> was had in much diſeſteem for it: And it was preſently reſolved to give Battel the next day. <hi>Brutus</hi> that Night at Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſhew'd himſelf very chearful and full of Hope; and entertain'd his Gueſts with Reaſonings and Diſcourſes of Philoſophy, and afterwards went to his Reſt. But <hi>Meſſala</hi> ſays, that <hi>Caſſius</hi> ſupp'd privately with a few of his neareſt Acquaintance; and that he appear'd thoughtful and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, contrary to his Temper and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom. That after Supper, he took him ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly by the hand, and ſpeaking to him kindly, as his manner was, ſaid in <hi>Greek, Bear witneſs for me,</hi> Meſſala, <hi>that I am brought into the ſame Neceſſity, as</hi> Pompey <hi>the Great was before me, of hazarding the Liberty of my Country upon one Battel: Yet ought we to be of Courage, relying on our good Fortune, which it were unjust to miſtruſt, though we have taken evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</hi> Theſe, <hi>Meſſala</hi> ſays, were the laſt words that <hi>Caſſius</hi> ſpake before he bad him farewell; and that he invited him to Supper with him the next Night, being his Birth-day. As ſoon as it was Morning,
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:36410:345"/>
the Signal of Battel, being a Scarlet Coat, was ſet out in <hi>Brutus</hi>'s and <hi>Caſſius</hi>'s Camp, and they themſelves met in the middle ſpace between their two Armies: There <hi>Caſſius</hi> ſpoke thus to <hi>Brutus, The Gods grant, O</hi> Brutus, <hi>that this day we may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and that all the reſt of our time we may live a happy Life together. But ſince the greateſt of humane Concerns are the moſt uncertain; and ſince it will be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for us ever to ſee one another again, if the Battel ſhould go againſt us, tell me, what is your reſolution concerning Flight and Death? Brutus</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>When I was young,</hi> Caſſius, <hi>and unskilful in Affairs, I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, I know not how, into an Opinion of Philoſophy, which made me accuſe</hi> Cato <hi>for killing himſelf, as thinking it an irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous act againſt the Gods, nor any way valiant among Men, not to ſubmit to Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, nor to be able fearleſly to receive and undergo whatever ill ſhall happen, but to fly from it. But now in the midſt of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger I am quite of another mind; for if Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſhall not diſpoſe what we now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake according to our wiſhes, I reſolve to try no fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ther hopes, nor make any more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for War, but will die contented with my Fortune. For I already have given up my Life to the Service of my Country</hi> on the Ides of <hi>March; and all the time that
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:36410:345"/>
I have lived ſince has been with Liberty and Honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſſius</hi> at theſe words ſmil'd, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing <hi>Brutus,</hi> ſaid, <hi>With theſe Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions let us go on upon the Enemy; for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we our ſelves ſhall Conquer, or have no cauſe to fear thoſe that do.</hi> After this, they diſcourſed among their Friends about the Ordering of the Battel: And <hi>Brutus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of <hi>Caſſius,</hi> that he might Command the Right Wing, though it was thought that this was more fit for <hi>Caſſius,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard both of his Age, and his Experience: Yet even in this <hi>Caſſius</hi> comply'd with <hi>Brutus;</hi> and placed <hi>Meſſala</hi> with the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianteſt of all his Legions, in the ſame Wing. <hi>Brutus</hi> immediately drew out his Horſe, excellently well equip'd, and took the ſame care of bringing up his Foot after them. Now <hi>Antony</hi>'s Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were caſting a Trench from the Marſh by which they were encamped, to cut off <hi>Caſſius</hi>'s paſſage to the Sea. <hi>Caeſar</hi> was at a diſtance in his Tent, not being able to be preſent himſelf, by reaſon of his Sickneſs; but his Soldiers not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that the Enemy would come to a ſet Battel, but only make ſome excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with their Darts and light Arms to diſturb thoſe that were working in their Trenches, nor taking enough notice of
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:36410:346"/>
them that were coming directly upon them, ready to give Battel, were amaz'd when they heard the confus'd, and the great out-cry that came from the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. In the mean while <hi>Brutus</hi> ſent his Tickets, in which was the Word of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, to the Captains; and himſelf riding about to all the Troops, encouraged the Souldiers; but there were but few of them that underſtood the Word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they engaged, and the moſt of them not ſtaying for it, with great fury and ſhouting ran upon the Enemy. This diſorder caus'd a great confuſion in the Army, and the Legions were ſcatter'd and diſperſed one from another: That of <hi>Meſſala</hi> firſt, and afterwards the next went beyond the left Wing of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and having cut off, and paſs'd that Wing, with the ſlaughter of not many of the Enemy, fell directly into <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Camp. <hi>Octavius</hi> himſelf (as his own <hi>Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> ſhew) had but juſt before been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed away, upon the perſwaſion of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius,</hi> one of his Friends, who had dreamt that he ſaw a Viſion, which commanded <hi>Caeſar</hi> to be carried out of the Camp. And it was believed that he was here ſlain; for the Souldiers had pierc'd his Litter, which was left empty, in many places with their Darts and Pikes. There was a great
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:36410:346"/>
ſlaughter in the Camp that was taken, and two thouſand <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> that were newly come to the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> were all cut off together. The reſt of the Army that had not gone round by the left Wing of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged his Front, eaſily overthrew them, being in great Conſternation for the loſs of their Camp, and ſlew upon the place three Legions; and being carried on with the ſtream of Victory, purſuing thoſe that fled, fell into the Camp with them, <hi>Brutus</hi> himſelf being there. But they that were conquered, took the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of what the Conquerours did not conſider; for they fell upon that part of the main Body, which they found ſhatter'd and unguarded, the right Wing being broke off from them, and furiouſly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away in the purſuit; yet they could not break into the midſt of their Battel, but were receiv'd with ſtrong reſiſtance and obſtinacy: Yet they put to flight the left Wing, where <hi>Caſſius</hi> commanded, being in great diſorder, and ignorant of what had paſſed on the other Wing, and purſuing 'em to their Camp, they pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and deſtroyed it, though neither of their Generals were preſent. For <hi>Antony,</hi> as they ſay, to avoid the fury of the firſt On-ſet, had retir'd into the Marſh that
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:36410:347"/>
was hard by; and <hi>Caeſar</hi> was no where to be found after his being convey'd out of the Tents. But ſome of the Souldiers ſhew'd <hi>Brutus</hi> their Swords bloody, and pretended that they had kill'd him; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing his Perſon and his Age. Now, the midſt of <hi>Brutus</hi>'s Battel had routed all that reſiſted them with great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and <hi>Brutus</hi> was every where as plainly Conquerour, as on the other ſide <hi>Caſſius</hi> was conquered. And this one miſtake was the ruine of their Affairs, That <hi>Brutus</hi> did not come to the relief of <hi>Caſſius,</hi> thinking that he, as well as himſelf, was Conquerour; and that <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> did not expect the Relief of <hi>Brutus,</hi> thinking that he too was overcome. For a Proof that the Victory was on <hi>Brutus</hi>'s ſide, <hi>Meſſala</hi> urges his taking of three Eagles, and many Enſigns of the Enemy, without loſing any of his own. <hi>Brutus,</hi> now returning from the purſuit, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deſtroyed <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Camp, wonder'd that he could not ſee <hi>Caſſius</hi>'s Tent ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing high, as it was wont, and appearing above the reſt, nor any of the others ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing round about it. For they were immediately overturn'd and pillaged by the Enemy upon their firſt falling into the Camp. But ſome that had a more quick and diſcerning ſight than the reſt,
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:36410:347"/>
acquainted <hi>Brutus</hi> that they ſaw a great deal of ſhining Armour, and Silver Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets moving to and fro about <hi>Caſſius</hi>'s Tents; and that they thought, that by their Number and their Armour, they could not be thoſe that they left to Guard the Camp; but yet, that there did not appear ſo great a number of dead Bodies thereabouts, as is probable would have been after the defeat of ſo many Legions. This firſt made <hi>Brutus</hi> ſuſpect <hi>Caſſius</hi>'s Misfortune; and leaving a Guard in the Enemies Tent, call'd back thoſe that were in the purſuit, and rallyed 'em together, to lead 'em to the relief of <hi>Caſſius,</hi> who was now in this condition; Firſt, he was angry at the firſt On-ſet, that <hi>Brutus</hi> his Souldiers made without the Word of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, or Command to Charge. Then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had overcome, he was as much diſpleaſed to ſee them all ruſh on to the Plunder and Spoil, and neglect to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round and encompaſs the reſt of the Enemy. Beſides this, by his own delay and ſlowneſs, more than by the briskneſs and conduct of the Captains of the other ſide, he found himſelf hem'd in by the Right Wing of the Enemy, and all his Horſe making with all haſt their eſcape, and flying towards the Sea; the Foot alſo began to fly, which he perceiving, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:36410:348"/>
as much as ever he could to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their flight, and bring them back; and ſnatching an Enſign out of the Hand of one that fled, he ſtuck it at his Feet, though he could hardly keep even his own Praetorian Band together: So that at laſt he was forc'd to fly with a few about him to a little Hill, that over-looked all the Plain. But he himſelf being weak ſighted, diſcover'd nothing, only the deſtruction of his Camp, and that with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; but they that were with him ſaw a great Body of Horſe, ſent by <hi>Brutus,</hi> moving towards him. <hi>Caſſius</hi> believ'd theſe were Enemies, and in purſuit of him; and ſent away <hi>Titinius</hi> (one of thoſe that was with him) to learn what they were. As ſoon as <hi>Brutus</hi>'s Horſe ſaw him coming, and knew him to be a Friend, and a faithful Servant of <hi>Caſſius,</hi> thoſe of them that were his more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Acquaintance ſhouting out for joy, and alighting from their Horſes, ſaluted and embraced him; and the reſt rode round about him in great Triumph and Noiſe through their exceſs of gladneſs at ſight of him. But this was the occaſion of the greateſt miſchief that could be: For <hi>Caſſius</hi> really thought that <hi>Titinius</hi> had been taken by the Enemy, and cry'd out, <hi>Through too much fondneſs of Life,
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:36410:348"/>
I have liv'd to endure the ſight of my Friend taken by the Enemy before my face.</hi> After which words, he retir'd into a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Tent, taking along with him only <hi>Pindarus,</hi> one of his freed-men, whom he had reſerved for ſuch an Occaſion ever ſince the unhappy Battel againſt the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> where <hi>Craſſus</hi> was ſlain. But he eſcaped that Misfortune; but now wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his looſe Garment about his Head, he made his Neck bare, and held it forth to <hi>Pindarus,</hi> commanding him to ſtrike; and his Head was found lying ſevered from his Body; but no Man ever ſaw <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darus</hi> after this Murther, from which ſome ſuſpected, that he had kill'd his Maſter without his Command. Soon after, they perceived who the Horſe-men were, and ſaw <hi>Titinius</hi> crown'd with Garlands, making what haſt he could towards <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius.</hi> But as ſoon as he underſtood by the Cries and Lamentations of his afflicted Friends, the unfortunate error and death of his General, he drew his Sword, and having very much accuſed and upbraided his own long ſtay, that had cauſed it, he ſlew himſelf. <hi>Brutus,</hi> as ſoon as he was aſſur'd of the Defeat of <hi>Caſſius,</hi> made haſte to him; but heard nothing of his Death, till he came near his Camp: Then having lamented over his Body,
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:36410:349"/>
calling him, <hi>The laſt of all the Romans,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That it was impoſſible that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould ever produce another man of ſo great a Spirit.</hi> He ſent away the Body to be buried at <hi>Thaſſus,</hi> leſt celebrating his Funeral within the Camp, might breed ſome diſorder. He then gathered his Souldiers together, and comforted them; and ſeeing them deſtitute of all things neceſſary, he promis'd to every Man 2000 <hi>Drachma's,</hi> in recompence of what he had loſt.</p>
               <p>They at theſe words took courage, and were aſtoniſh'd at the Magnificence of the gift; and waited upon him at his parting, with ſhouts and praiſes, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying him for the only General of all the four, who was not overcome in the Battel. And indeed he prov'd by his Actions that it was not without reaſon he believ'd he ſhould Conquer; for with a few Legions he overthrew all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted him; and if all his Soldiers had fought, and the moſt of them had not paſt beyond the Enemy in purſuit of the Plunder, it is very likely that he had ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly defeated them all. There fell of his ſide eight thouſand Men, reckoning the Servants of the Army, whom <hi>Brutus</hi> call'd <hi>Brigas:</hi> And on the other ſide, <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſala</hi> ſays, his Opinion is, that there were
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:36410:349"/>
ſlain above twice that number; for which reaſon they were more out of Heart than <hi>Brutus,</hi> till a Servant of <hi>Caſſius,</hi> named <hi>Demetrius,</hi> came in the Evening to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,</hi> and brought to him the Garment which he had taken from his Maſter's dead Body, and his Sword: At the ſight of which they were ſo encouraged, that as ſoon as it was Morning, they drew out their whole Force into the Field, and ſtood in Battel-Array againſt <hi>Brutus.</hi> But <hi>Brutus</hi> found both his Camps wavering and in diſorder, (for his own being fill'd with Priſoners, requir'd a Guard more ſtrict than ordinary over 'em; and that of <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> was much diſcontented at the change of their General; beſides, ſome Envy and Hatred which thoſe that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd bore to that part of the Army which were Conquerours) wherefore he thought it convenient to put his Army in Array, but to abſtain as much as he could from fighting.</p>
               <p>All the Slaves that were taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, of which there was a great number that behav'd themſelves not without ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion among the Souldiers, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be ſlain; but of the Free-men and Citizens, ſome he diſmiſs'd, ſaying, <hi>That among the Enemy they were rather Priſoners than with him; for with them
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:36410:350"/>
they were Captives and Slaves, but with him Free-men and Citizens of</hi> Rome. Others he was forced to hide, and help them to eſcape privately, perceiving that ſome of his Friends and Commanders were implacably bent upon Revenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. Among the Captives there was one <hi>Volumnius,</hi> a Mimick, and <hi>Sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culio,</hi> a Buffoon; of theſe <hi>Brutus</hi> took no manner of notice, but his Friends brought them before him, and accuſed them, that even then in that condition they did not refrain from their abuſive Jeſts and ſcurrillous Language. <hi>Brutus</hi> having his Mind taken up with other Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, ſaid nothing to their Accuſation; but the judgment of <hi>Meſſala Corvinus</hi> was, That they ſhould be whip'd publickly upon a Scaffold, and ſo ſent naked to the Captains of the Enemy, to ſhew 'em what ſort of Fellow-drinkers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions were fit for ſuch Warriours. At this ſome that were preſent laughed; but <hi>Publius Caſca,</hi> he that gave the firſt Wound to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſaid, <hi>That it was not decent to jest and make ſo merry at the Funerals of</hi> Caſſius. <hi>But thou, O</hi> Brutus, <hi>ſays he, will ſhew what eſteem you have for the memory of that General, in puniſhing or preſerving thoſe that ſcoff'd and ſpoke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſively of him.</hi> To this, <hi>Brutus,</hi> with
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:36410:350"/>
great indignation, reply'd, <q>Why then, <hi>Caſca,</hi> do you tell me of this, and not do your ſelf what you think fitting?</q> This Anſwer of <hi>Brutus</hi> was taken for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the death of theſe wretched Men; ſo they were carried away and ſlain.</p>
               <p>After this, he gave the Souldiers the Reward that he had promis'd them; and having ſlightly reprov'd 'em for having fallen upon the Enemy in diſorder, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Word of Battel or Command: He promis'd 'em, that if they behav'd themſelves bravely in the next Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he would give them up two Cities to ſpoil and plunder, <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemon.</hi> This is the only inexcuſable fault in the Life of <hi>Brutus;</hi> though <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> were much more cruel in the Rewards that they gave to their Souldiers after Victory: For they drove out almoſt all the old Inhabitants of <hi>Italy,</hi> to put their Souldiers in poſſeſſion of other Mens Lands and Cities; but indeed their only deſign and end in undertaking the War, was to obtain Dominion and Empire. But <hi>Brutus,</hi> for the reputation of his Vertue, could not either overcome or ſave himſelf but with Juſtice and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, eſpecially after the death of <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> who was generally accus'd of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Brutus</hi> upon ſeveral violent and cruel
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:36410:351"/>
Actions. But now, as in a Ship, when the Rudder is broken by a Storm, the Mariners fit and nail on ſome other piece of Wood inſtead of it; ſtriving againſt the danger not ſo well as before, but as well as in that neceſſity they can. So <hi>Brutus</hi> being at the Head of ſo great an Army, and engaged in ſuch weighty Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and having no Commander equal to <hi>Caſſius,</hi> was forc'd to make uſe of thoſe that he had, and to do, and to ſay many things according to their Advice; which he chiefly follow'd in whatever might conduce to the bringing of <hi>Caſſius</hi>'s Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers into better Order. For they were very head-ſtrong and intractable, bold and inſolent in the Camp for want of their General, but in the Field cowardly and fearful, remembring that they had been beaten. Neither were the Affairs of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Antony</hi> in any better poſture; for they were ſtreightned for Proviſion, and the Camp being in a low Ground, they expected to endure a very hard Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For being encompaſs'd with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, and a great quantity of Rain, as is uſual in Autumn, having fallen after the Battel, their Tents were all fill'd with Mire and Water, which through the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Weather immediately froze.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="677" facs="tcp:36410:351"/>
And while they were in this condition, there was News brought to them of their loſs at Sea. For <hi>Brutus</hi>'s Fleet fell upon their Ships, which were bringing a great ſupply of Souldiers out of <hi>Italy;</hi> and ſo entirely defeated 'em, that but very few eſcaped being ſlain, and they too were forc'd by Famine to feed upon the Sails and Tackle of the Ship. As ſoon as they heard this, they made what haſt they could to come to the deciſion of a Battel, before <hi>Brutus</hi> ſhould have notice of his good Succeſs. For it happen'd, that the Fight both by Sea and Land was on the ſame day. But by ſome misfortune, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the fault of his Commanders, <hi>Brutus</hi> knew not of his Victory till twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days after. For had he been informed of this, he would not have been brought to a ſecond Battel, ſince he had ſufficient Proviſions for his Army for a long time, and was very advantageouſly poſted, his Camp being ſafe from the injuries of the Weather, and almoſt inacceſſible to the Enemy: And his being abſolute Maſter of the Sea, and having at Land overcome on that ſide, wherein he himſelf was engag'd, would have mightily encourag'd him. But (it ſeems) the ſtate of <hi>Rome</hi> not enduring any longer to be govern'd by Many, but neceſſarily requiring a Monarchy, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:36410:352"/>
that it might remove out of the way the only Man that was able to reſiſt him, that was deſtin'd to this Empire, cut off this good Fortune from coming to the ears of <hi>Brutus;</hi> Tho it came but a very little too late: For the very Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fight, <hi>Clodius,</hi> a deſerter from the Enemy, came and told him, that <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> had receiv'd advice of the loſs of his Fleet, and for that reaſon was in ſuch haſt to come to a Battel. This Relation met with no Credit, neither would <hi>Brutus</hi> ſo much as admit him to his Preſence, but utterly deſpis'd him, as one that had had no good Information, or one that had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Lyes to pleaſe him, and bring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into favour.</p>
               <p>The ſame Night, they ſay, the Viſion appear'd again to <hi>Brutus</hi> in the ſame ſhape that it did before, but vaniſh'd away without ſpeaking. But <hi>Publius Volum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> (a Man given to the ſtudy of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, and one that had from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning born Arms with <hi>Brutus)</hi> makes no mention of this Apparition, but ſays, that the firſt Standard was cover'd with a ſwarm of Bees; and that there was one of the Captains, whoſe Arm of it ſelf ſweated Oyl of Roſes; and though they often dryed and wiped it, yet it would not ceaſe. And that immediately before
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:36410:352"/>
the Battel, two Eagles falling upon each other, fought in the ſpace between the two Armies; that the whole Field kept incredible ſilence, and all were intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Spectacle, till at laſt that which was on <hi>Brutus</hi>'s ſide yielded and fled. But the ſtory of the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> is very famous, who meeting the Standard-bearer at the opening the Gate of the Camp, was cut to pieces by the Souldiers that took it for an ill Omen.—<hi>Brutus</hi> having brought his Army into the Field, and ſet 'em in Array againſt the Enemy; he paus'd a long while before he would fight, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining his Army, he began to have ſome ſuſpicions of ſome of them, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were accus'd to him. Beſides, he ſaw his Horſe begin the Fight not with any great Vigour or Reſolution, but ſtill expecting what the Foot would do; then ſuddenly, <hi>Camulatius,</hi> a very good Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and one whom for his Valour he highly eſteem'd, riding hard by <hi>Brutus</hi> himſelf, went over to the Enemy, the ſight of which griev'd <hi>Brutus</hi> exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. So that partly out of Anger, and partly out of fear of ſome greater Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Deſertion, he immediately drew on his Forces upon the Enemy, after Three of the Clock in the Afternoon. <hi>Brutus</hi> on his ſide had the better, violently charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:36410:353"/>
the Enemies leſt Wing, which gave way and retreated, and the Horſe too fell in together with the Foot, when they ſaw them amaz'd and in diſorder. But the other Wing, when the Captains order'd them to march on to the Fight, fearing to be encompaſs'd, being fewer in number than their Adverſaries, ſpread themſelves, and widen'd the middle of their Battel, by which being weakned, they could not withſtand the Charge, but at the firſt On-ſet fled. After their defeat, the Enemy ſurrounded <hi>Brutus</hi> behind, who all the while performed all that was poſſible for an expert General and valiant Souldier; ſhewing in the greateſt danger a Courage and a Conduct that deſerv'd to Overcome. But that which was advantageous to him in the former Fight, was much to his prejudice in this ſecond. For in the firſt Fight, that part which was beaten, was preſently cut in pieces; but in this, of <hi>Caſſius</hi>'s Souldiers that fled, few were ſlain, and thoſe that eſcaped, daunted with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaten, put the greateſt part of the Army, when they came to joyn with them, into Deſpair and Confuſion. Here <hi>Marcus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Cato,</hi> was ſlain fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and behaving himſelf with great bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very in the midſt of the Youth of the greateſt Quality and Valour. He would
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:36410:353"/>
neither fly, nor give the leaſt ground, but ſtill fighting, and declaring who he was, and naming his Father's Name, he fell upon a heap of dead Bodies of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And ſeveral others of the braveſt Men in the Army were there ſlain, who ran in to ſave <hi>Brutus.</hi> There was in the Field one <hi>Lucilius,</hi> an excellent Man, and a Friend of <hi>Brutus,</hi> who ſeeing ſome of the <hi>Barbarian</hi>'s Horſe, taking no notice of any other in the purſuit, but directly making towards <hi>Brutus,</hi> reſolv'd to ſtop them, though with the hazard of his Life; and being left a little behind, told them, that he was <hi>Brutus:</hi> They believ'd him the rather, becauſe he prayed to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Antony,</hi> pretending that he fear'd <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but durſt truſt him. They over-joyed with their Prey, and thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wonderfully fortunate, carried him along with them in the Night, having firſt ſent Meſſengers to <hi>Antony</hi> of their coming: He was extremely pleas'd, and came to meet them; and all the reſt that heard that <hi>Brutus</hi> was taken and brought alive, flock'd together to ſee him; ſome pitying his Fortune, others accuſing him of a meanneſs unbecoming his former Glory, that out of too much love of Life, would be a Prey to <hi>Barbarians.</hi> When they came near together, <hi>Antony</hi> ſtood
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:36410:354"/>
ſtill, conſidering with himſelf in what manner he ſhould receive <hi>Brutus.</hi> But <hi>Lucilius</hi> being brought to him, with great confidence ſaid, <hi>Be aſſur'd,</hi> Antony, <hi>that no Enemy either has, or ever ſhall take</hi> Marcus Brutus <hi>alive, (forbid it, ye Gods, that Fortune ſhould ever ſo much prevail above Vertue) but he ſhall be found, alive or dead, as becomes himſelf. As for me, I am come hither by a cheat that I put upon your Souldiers, and am ready, upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to ſuffer whatever Torments you will inflict.</hi> All were amaz'd to hear <hi>Lucilius</hi> ſpeak theſe words: But <hi>Antony,</hi> turning himſelf to thoſe that brought him, ſaid, <hi>I perceive, my Fellow-ſouldiers, that you are concern'd, and take it ill, that you have been thus deceiv'd, and think your ſelves abus'd and injur'd by it: But know, that you have met with a Booty better than that you ſought: For you were in ſearch of an Enemy, but you have brought me here a Friend. For indeed I am uncertain how I ſhould have us'd</hi> Brutus, <hi>if you had brought him alive; but of this I am ſure, that 'tis better to have ſuch Men as</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius <hi>our Friends, than our Enemies.</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid this, he embrac'd <hi>Lucilius,</hi> and for the preſent commended him to the care of one of his Friends, and ever after found him a ſteady and a faithful Friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="683" facs="tcp:36410:354"/>
                  <hi>Brutus</hi> had now paſt a little Brook, encompaſs'd with Rocks, and ſhaded with Trees, and it being Night, would go no farther, but ſet down in a hollow place at the foot of a great Rock, with a few of his Captains and Friends about him. At firſt, looking up to Heaven, that was then full of Stars, he repeated two Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, one of which, <hi>Volumnius</hi> writes, was this,</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Puniſh, great <hi>Jove,</hi> the Author of theſe ills.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>The other, he ſays, he has forgot. Soon after, naming ſeverally all his Friends that had been ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ain before his face in the Battel, he fetch'd a deep ſigh, eſpecially at the mentioning of <hi>Flavius</hi> and <hi>Labio,</hi> whereof one was his <note n="*" place="margin">Labio.</note> Lieutenant, and the other <note n="†" place="margin">Flavius.</note> Maſter of his Workmen in the Camp. In the mean time, one of his Companions that was very thirſty, and ſaw <hi>Brutus</hi> in the ſame condition, took his Helmet, and ran to the Brook for Water, when a noiſe being heard from the other ſide of the River, <hi>Volumnius</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Dardanus, Brutus</hi>'s Armour-bearer with him, went out to ſee what it was: They return'd in a very ſhort ſpace, and enquir'd about the Water: But <hi>Brutus</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry calmly ſmiling, ſaid to <hi>Volumnius, It
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:36410:355"/>
is all drunk, but you ſhall have ſome more fetch'd.</hi> But he that had brought the firſt Water being ſent again, was in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being taken by the Enemy; but, having receiv'd a Wound, with much difficulty eſcaped.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Brutus</hi> gueſſing that not many of his Men were ſlain in the Fight, <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilius</hi> undertook to paſs through the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my (for there was no other way) and to ſee what was become of their Camp; and promis'd, that if he found all things there ſafe, to hold up a Torch for a Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and then return. The Torch was held up, for <hi>Statilius</hi> got ſafe to the Camp; but he after a long time not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, <hi>Brutus</hi> ſaid, <hi>If</hi> Statilius <hi>be alive, he will come back.</hi> But it happen'd, that in his return he fell into the Enemies hands, and was ſlain. The Night now being far ſpent, <hi>Brutus,</hi> as he was ſitting, lean'd his Head towards his Servant <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and ſpoke to him; he anſwer'd him not, but fell a weeping. After that, he drew aſide his Armour-bearer, <hi>Dardanus,</hi> and had ſome Diſcourſe with him in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate: At laſt, ſpeaking to <hi>Volumnius</hi> in <hi>Greek,</hi> he conjur'd him by their common Studies and former Converſation, that he would take hold of his Sword with him, and help him to thruſt it through him:
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:36410:355"/>
                  <hi>Volumnius</hi> refus'd it, and ſeveral others did the like; and one of them ſaying, that there was no ſtaying there, but they needs muſt fly: <hi>Brutus</hi> riſing up, ſaid, <hi>Yes indeed, we muſt fly, but not with our Feet, but with our Hands.</hi> Then taking each of them by the Hand, with a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Countenance he ſaid, <hi>That he found an infinite Satisfaction in this, That none of his Friends had been falſe to him. That as for Fortune, he was angry with That, only for his Countries ſake. As for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he thought he was much more happy than they who had overcome; not only in regard of what was paſt, but even in his preſent Condition; ſince he was now leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind him ſuch a Reputation of his Vertue, as none of the Conquerours, with all their Arms and Riches, ſhould ever be able to acquire, no more than they could hinder Posterity from believing and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That being unjuſt and wicked Men, they had destroy'd the Juſt, and the Good, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurp'd an Empire to which they had no Right.</hi> After this, having exhorted and beſeech'd all about him to provide for their own ſafety, he withdrew from them with two or three only of his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Friends; <hi>Strato</hi> was one of theſe, with whom he had contracted an Acquaintance when they both ſtudy'd Rhetorick toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:36410:356"/>
Him he plac'd next to himſelf, and taking hold of the Hilt of his Sword, and directing it with both his hands, he fell upon it, and kill'd himſelf. But others ſay, that not he himſelf, but <hi>Strato,</hi> at the earneſt entreaty of <hi>Brutus,</hi> turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his Head, held the Sword, upon which he violently throwing himſelf, it pierc'd his Breaſt, and he immediately dyed. This ſame <hi>Strato, Meſſala,</hi> a Friend of <hi>Brutus,</hi> being after reconcil'd to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> brought to him once at his leiſure, and with Tears in his Eyes ſaid, <hi>This, O</hi> Caeſar, <hi>is the Man that did the laſt Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office to my beloved</hi> Brutus. Upon which, <hi>Caeſar</hi> received him kindly, and had good uſe of his Service among the reſt of the Valiant <hi>Greeks,</hi> that ſerved him in the Battel of <hi>Actium.</hi> It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of <hi>Meſſala</hi> himſelf, that when <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> once gave him this Commendation, That tho he was his fierceſt Enemy at <hi>Philippi</hi> in the cauſe of <hi>Brutus,</hi> yet he had ſhewed himſelf his moſt entire Friend in the Fight of <hi>Actium.</hi> He anſwered, <hi>You ſhall always find me,</hi> Caeſar, <hi>on the beſt and juſtest ſide.</hi> Now, when <hi>Antony</hi> had found the Body of <hi>Brutus,</hi> he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the richeſt Coat that he had to be thrown over it; and afterwards the Coat being ſtolen, he found the Thief, and had

him put to death; and then ſent the Aſhes and Relicks of <hi>Brutus</hi> to his Mother <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilia.</hi> As for <hi>Porcia</hi> his Wife, <hi>Nicolaus</hi> the Philoſopher, and <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> write, That being deſirous to die, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hindred by her Friends, who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually watch'd her, from killing her ſelf, ſhe ſnatched ſome burning Coals out of the fire, and ſhutting them cloſe in her mouth, ſtifled her ſelf, and dyed. Though there is yet extant a Letter of <hi>Brutus</hi> to his Friends, in which he laments the death of <hi>Porcia,</hi> and accuſes them for neglecting her ſo, that ſhe deſir'd to die, rather than languiſh with her Diſeaſe.

               <p>Neither did he, as <hi>Brutus,</hi> gather to himſelf from the War any Strength or Riches; but laid out of his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and employ'd his private Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for the Liberty of his Country.</p>

               <p>But take notice, it was not the ſame thing to free the <hi>Sicilians</hi> from <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> and to ſupport <hi>Rome</hi> againſt <hi>Caeſar;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the former own'd himſelf a Tyrant, and vex'd <hi>Sicily</hi> with a thouſand Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.

                  <pb n="690" facs="tcp:36410:358"/>
On the contrary, <hi>Dion</hi> was hotly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by the Commons, for having let <hi>Dionyſius</hi> eſcape; and for not having dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged up the former Tyrant's Grave.</p>

However, the Matter turns otherwiſe; for the chief Glory of both, was their hatred of Tyranny, and abhorrence of Wickedneſs; this was clear and ſincere in <hi>Brutus:</hi> For he had no private Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but put all to the Risk for the Liberty of his Country. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had he not been piqu'd, had not fought. This is plain from <hi>Plato</hi>'s Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, where it is ſhewed, that he was turn'd out, and did not forſake the Court, to wage War upon <hi>Dionyſius.</hi> Moreover, the Publick Good reconcil'd and made <hi>Brutus Pompey</hi>'s Friend, and <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; propoſing for his Hatred and his Friendſhip, no other End and Standard, but Juſtice. <hi>Dion</hi> was very ſerviceable to <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> whilſt in favour; when no longer truſted, he grew angry, and fell to Arms. Hereupon his Friends were not all of them ſatisfied with his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, leſt having overcome <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> he might not ſettle the Government, by ſome ſofter Name, cheating the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>The very Enemies of <hi>Brutus</hi> would ſay, That he had no other End or Aim, from firſt to laſt, ſave only to reſtore to the <hi>Roman</hi> People their Ancient Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

Whereas it required an huge Soul, and undaunted Courage, to entertain but a Thought of vanquiſhing <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable by his Reputation, his Power, and his Proſperity; and whoſe Head ſo buzz'd with the Names of the <hi>Parthian</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Kings, that he could not ſleep.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dion</hi> was no ſooner ſeen in <hi>Sicily,</hi> but thouſands ran in to him, and joyn'd him againſt <hi>Dionyſius;</hi> whereas the Renown of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> even when dead, gave heart to his Friends: And his very Name ſo heightened the Perſon that took it, that from a ſimple Boy, he preſently became the Chief of the <hi>Romans.</hi> And he uſed it for a Spell againſt the Malice and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity of <hi>Antony.</hi>

naked and unprovided. For it was not on the ſudden, nor alone, nor with a few that he fell upon and killed <hi>Caeſar;</hi> but after long concerting the Plot, and Confidence in a great many Men, not one of whom deceiv'd him: for he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſently diſcern'd the beſt Men, or by confiding in them, made them good. But <hi>Dion,</hi> either making a wrong Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, truſted himſelf with ill Men, or elſe by his employing them, made ill men of good; either of the two would be a Reflection on a Wiſe Man. <hi>Plato</hi> is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere upon him, for chuſing ſuch for Friends, as betray'd him: Beſides, when <hi>Dion</hi> was kill'd, none appear'd to revenge his Death.</p>
               <p>Whereas <hi>Brutus,</hi> even amongſt his Enemies, had <hi>Antony</hi> that buried him ſplendidly. <hi>Caeſar</hi> alſo took care his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ſhould be preſerved.

Wherefore they tell us that <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> recruiting his

'Tis ſaid of him that he honourably diſcharged his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in <hi>Germany,</hi> and being made Pro-conſul in <hi>Libya,</hi> he gained that Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion few ever had. But his thrifty, nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Entertainments (beneath the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a General) was a great diminution;
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:36410:363"/>
and only afforded him the mean credit of being call'd an orderly, ſober Gentleman. He was intruſted by <hi>Nero</hi> with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Spain,</hi> when he had not yet learned to revere the great Citizens in Authority. To the Opinion they had of his mild Natural Temper, his old Age occaſioned a Belief that he would act too cautiouſly. And although he had the management of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Officers in his own hands, who with ſavage cruelty harraſs'd the Provinces<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

And when Lampoons were made upon <hi>Nero,</hi> and ſung every where about, he neither prohibited them, nor ſhewed any indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as the Procurators did; for which indeed he was the more beloved; as alſo that he was well acquainted with them, having been in chief power there eight years; at which time <hi>Junius Vindex,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Forces in <hi>Gaul,</hi> began to make Head againſt <hi>Nero,</hi> and 'tis reported, that Letters came to him before it fully broke out into Rebellion; which he ſeemed neither to give credit to, nor thwarted, nor in the leaſt acquainted <hi>Nero,</hi> whereas other Officers had inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, according to what came to their

He then propounded this Advice to his Friends, ſome of hom thought it fit to expect what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap>motions there might be, or what inclinations <hi>Rome</hi> might diſcover towards an alteration; but <hi>Titus Junius</hi> Captain of the Guards, ſpoke thus; Galba, <hi>what means this Demur, to enquire whether we ſhall continue faithful to</hi> Nero, <hi>is perfect Madneſs; what though</hi> Vindex <hi>be an Enemy of</hi> Nero's, <hi>yet his Friendſhip is in no wiſe to be rejected, much leſs to be inform'd againſt, or oppos'd by Arms, becauſe he would rather have you the</hi> Roman <hi>Emperour than</hi> Nero <hi>their Tyrant.</hi> Thereupon, <hi>Galba</hi> by an Edict appointed a certain Day for enfranchiſing thoſe that requeſted it, the Rumour of which ſoon brought together a great crowd of Men ſo readily inclin'd to innovations, that he ſcarcely appeared ſtepping up to the Chair of State, but they with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:36410:364"/>
ſaluted him Emperour, which Title he refuſed at preſent to take upon him; but after he had a while inveighed againſt <hi>Nero,</hi> and bemoaned the loſs of thoſe brave Men that had been deſtroyed by him, he offered himſelf, and ſervice to his Country, not by thoſe ſpecious Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or Emperour, but only as Lieutenant to the Senate and People.</p>
            <p>Now that <hi>Vindex</hi> did wiſely in inviting <hi>Galba</hi> to the Empire, <hi>Nero</hi> himſelf bore teſtimony, though he ſeem'd to deſpiſe him, and altogether to ſlight the <hi>Gauls</hi> and their Concerns; yet when he heard of <hi>Galba</hi> (as by chance he had waſh'd and ſate down to Dinner) he in indignation overturn'd the Table. But the Senate voting <hi>Galba</hi> an Enemy, he being diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſport, and likewiſe perſonate a confidence amongſt his Friends; <hi>This bodes no ill to me</hi> (ſays he) <hi>who want ſuch a Booty as that of the</hi> Gauls, <hi>which muſt all fall in as lawful prize; and for</hi> Galba'<hi>s Eſtate, I can uſe, or ſell it as occaſion ſerves, he appearing an open Enemy:</hi> and accordingly appointed a publick Auction, wherein <hi>Galba</hi>'s Fortune was expoſed to Sale: which when <hi>Galba</hi> heard of, he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſter'd <hi>Nero</hi>'s Eſtate in <hi>Spain,</hi> and found far more brisk bidders.</p>
            <p>The moſt part in this Juncture revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

from <hi>Nero,</hi> and adher'd to <hi>Galba;</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Clodius Macer</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> and <hi>Virginius Rufus,</hi> Commander of the <hi>German</hi> Forces in <hi>Gallia,</hi> took different meaſures from all the reſt; yet theſe two were not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely unanimous; for <hi>Clodius</hi> being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his Rapines and Murders (being acted by cruelty and covetouſneſs) ſtood wavering, not finding it ſafe, either to retain or quit his Command. But <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> who had the Command of their chief Legions, by whom he was often complemented with the Title of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and preſs'd to take it upon him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd that he neither would aſſume that honor himſelf, nor ſee it given to any other, than whom the Senate ſhould elect.</p>
            <p>Theſe things at firſt, did not a little perplex <hi>Galba;</hi> but preſently <hi>Virginius</hi> and <hi>Vindex</hi>'s Forces compell'd their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders (having got the Reins, as it were, out of their hands) to an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where <hi>Vindex</hi> ſuſtaining the loſs of 20000 men, and offering violence to himſelf, the Report ſtrait ſpread abroad, that all deſired <hi>Virginius</hi> ſhould take the Empire upon him, or they would return to <hi>Nero</hi> again. <hi>Galba</hi> being ſtartled at this, wrote to <hi>Virginius,</hi> exhorting him to join with him, for the preſervation of the Empire, and the liberty of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
               <pb n="703" facs="tcp:36410:365"/>
and ſo retiring with his Friends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Colonia,</hi> (a Town in <hi>Spain)</hi> he paſt away his time, rather repenting his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer raſhneſs (wiſhing for his wonted eaſe and privacy) than ſetting about what was fit to be done. It was now Summer, when on a ſudden in the Evening comes one of <hi>Galba</hi>'s Free-men from <hi>Rome</hi> (a <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilian</hi> by Birth) in ſeven days ſpace, and being inform'd where <hi>Galba</hi> was repoſing himſelf in private, ruſhing by the Grooms of the Chamber, he haſtily ran into the Room, and told him, that <hi>Nero</hi> being yet alive, but not appearing, firſt the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and then the People and Senate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd <hi>Galba</hi> Emperour; not long after, it was reported that <hi>Nero</hi> was dead; but I (ſays he) not giving credit to common Fame, went my ſelf and when I beheld him ſtretch'd out ſtark dead, I haſtned to bring the News. This clearly revived <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> and a great Crowd haſtning to the door, were very confident of the truth of his Tidings, though the ſpeed of the man was almoſt incredible. Two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came <hi>Titus Jun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

On his Free-man he conferr'd the honour of the Gold-Ring, and <hi>Marci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi>
               <pb n="704" facs="tcp:36410:366"/>
               <hi>Vicellius</hi> was made chief Ruler over all his Free-men. But <hi>Nymphidius Sabinus</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> not fair and leiſurely, but violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at one pull, ingroſs'd all buſineſs to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>C.

Thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming on his intereſt, he ſtrait command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Tigellinus</hi> in joint commiſſion with himſelf, to lay down his Arms, and making a noble Treat, he invited the Pro-conſuls, and chief Commanders, making uſe of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi>'s Name to the invitation; he alſo prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red many of the Army to declare that <hi>Galba</hi> ought to be ſent to with a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>Nymphidius</hi> might be ſole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander.</p>
            <p>Moreover what the Senate acted, out of reſpect to him, ſtiling him their Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and attending daily at his Gates, and giving him the Complement of confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Acts, carried him on to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter degree of Arrogance, that in a ſhort time he became not only to be envied, but even dreaded by his Adorers. When the Conſuls themſelves had diſpatcht their
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:36410:366"/>
Couriers with the decrees of the Senate to the Emperour ſealed (whom the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of each Town took care to ſpeed away with all convenience) he highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it, that it was done without his Warrant, and none of his Souldiers em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed on the Errand. Nay further, he deliberated what courſe to take with the Conſuls themſelves, but upon their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and apology, he was at laſt paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: To gratifie the People, he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to beat out the Brains of any Malignant of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Party. Amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: they murthered one <hi>Spicillius,</hi> a Fencer, in the Market-place, and threw him under <hi>Nero</hi>'s Statues, which they dragg'd about the Street. <hi>Apponius,</hi> they knock'd down flat to the ground, and after drove loaded Carts over him, to make ſure work, though he was one had accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Nero;</hi> and many others they tore in pieces, ſome of them no way obnoxious, in ſo much that <hi>Mauriſcus,</hi> a perſon deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly of great account and quality, told the Senate that he fear'd in a ſhort time, they might wiſh for <hi>Nero</hi> again. <hi>Nymphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> now advancing towards the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his hopes, did not refuſe the honour of being call'd <hi>Caius Caeſar</hi>'s Son, Succeſſor to <hi>Tiberius Caius,</hi> who, as it is ſaid, was well acquainted with his Mother
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:36410:367"/>
in his youth, a woman indeed handſome enough, the Off-ſpring of <hi>Kaliſto,</hi> one of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Free-men, and a certain Sempſtreſs. But it's plain that <hi>Caius</hi>'s familiarity with his Mother, was of too late date for him to lay any claim to; but it was ſtrongly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, he might if he pleas'd pretend to <hi>Martianus,</hi> a <hi>Gladiator,</hi> whom his Mother <hi>Nymphidia</hi> had a great kindneſs for; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man of repute in his way, whom alſo he much reſembled; however, 'tis well he certainly own'd <hi>Nymphidia</hi> for his Mother. The down-fall of <hi>Nero</hi> he aſcrib'd to himſelf alone, and thought he was not ſufficiently rewarded with the Honours and Riches he enjoy'd; nay, nor with <hi>Spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus (Nero</hi>'s beloved darling) in to the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, whom he immediately ſent for at the interment of <hi>Nero,</hi> and careſs'd him as though he had been his Spouſe, calling him <hi>Poppaeus,</hi> but he muſt alſo aſpire to the Empire, and by ſome Female Friends and Senators (wrought underhand) to aſſiſt him in the buſineſs. He diſpatch'd one <hi>Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus,</hi> a Friend of his, into <hi>Spain,</hi> to view the poſture of affairs; but all things ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded well with <hi>Galba</hi> after <hi>Nero</hi>'s death, only <hi>Virginius</hi> ſtanding doubtful, created a jealouſie in him, leſt he ſhould liſten to the ſuggeſtions of ſome who encouraged him, to take the government upon him; having

at preſent, beſide his conqueſt over <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex,</hi> the command of a great Army, and reduc'd <hi>Gaul</hi> (a conſiderable part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire) when they ſeem'd waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and indeed rather inclin'd to Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. No man ſurely had a greater Name and Reputation than <hi>Virginius,</hi> who in their great revolutions freed the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> from Tyranny, and a <hi>Gallick</hi> War.</p>
            <p>But he ſtanding to his firſt reſolves, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to the Senate the power of electing an Emperour; but when it was manifeſt that <hi>Nero</hi> was dead, the Souldies preſt him hard to it, and one of the Colonels en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring his Tent with his drawn Sword, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him either take the Government or that. But after <hi>Fabius Valens</hi> having the command of a Regiment, had firſt ſworn Fealty to <hi>Galba,</hi> and had Letters from <hi>Rome</hi> of the Reſolves of the Senate, with much a-do he perſwaded the Army to declare <hi>Galba</hi> Emperor. <hi>Flaccus Hardonius</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, by his Commiſſion, was ſent to ſucceed him, to whom when he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd his forces, he marcht to meet <hi>Galba,</hi> and attend him on his Journey, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently ſhew'd him no diſpleaſure, being under a little dread of him, nor yet much reſpect on the account of his Friends, chiefly <hi>Titus Junius,</hi> who enviouſly think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hinder <hi>Virginius</hi>'s promotion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:36410:368"/>
much to his happineſs, reſcuing him from thoſe hazards and hardſhips, the other Officers were involved in, which occaſioned him a quiet life, and a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able old Age. About <hi>Narbon</hi> a City in <hi>Gaul,</hi> ſome of the Senators met him by order of the Houſe, and (after they had diſpatched their complements) beſeeched him to make what haſte he could to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the People, that impatiently expected him; whom he diſcourſed cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly and familiarly, but in his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, tho <hi>Nymphidius</hi> had ſent him both rich Proviſion and Attendants of <hi>Nero</hi>'s, he laid all aſide and made uſe of nothing but his own, which made him appear great, far above thoſe little vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But in a ſhort time <hi>Junius</hi> abuſing his generous civil way of treating with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pomp, terming it popularity, and a meer pretence to moderation unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Grandure, perſwaded him to make uſe of <hi>Nero</hi>'s ſtore, and make his Regal's Noble and Princelike; ſo that it ſoon appeared that the Old Man, had put himſelf under <hi>Junius</hi>'s diſpoſal; a Perſon exceſſive covetous, above all things, and not a little addicted to Women; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a youngſter newly entred into the Wars, under <hi>Calviſius Sabinus,</hi> he brought his Captains Wife, a wanton dame, in a

But what he acted covetouſly for his own advantage (having great power with <hi>Galba)</hi> was either the real or ſeeming cauſe of many tragical and fatal miſchiefs.

Indeed the taking of <hi>Macron</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi> by <hi>Trebonius,</hi> and <hi>Fronteius</hi> by <hi>Valens</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> had a fair pretence, they being dreaded as armed Men, having their Souldiers at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir; but to deny <hi>Tertullian</hi> an old Man and unarmed, to try to clear himſelf, was not agreeable to that moderation, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity at firſt promiſed. Theſe things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected much upon <hi>Galba.</hi> When he came within three Miles or thereabouts of the City, he hapned to light on a diſorderly rabble of Sea-men, who had beſet him in
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:36410:371"/>
his paſs. Theſe were they whom <hi>Nero</hi> made Souldiers, ordering them into one diviſion. They ſo rudely crowded to have their commiſſion reinforced, in ſo much, that they obſtructed the ſight of <hi>Galba,</hi> ſo that he could not ſalute thoſe that came to accoſt their new Emperor; but tumultuouſly preſſed on with loud ſhouts, to have colours to their Legion; and quarters aſſign'd them. But <hi>Galba</hi> put 'em off till another time, which they interpreting a denial, grew more inſolent and mutinous, ſome of 'em with their drawn Swords in their hands; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Galba</hi> commanded the Horſe to ride over them, whereby they were ſoon rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, never a Man ſtanding his ground, and many of them were ſlain in the purſuit. An ill Omen, that <hi>Galba</hi> ſhould make his firſt entry, through ſo much blood and ſlaughter. Now he became dreadful and terrible to thoſe who formerly deſpiſed his infirm old age. When he attempted to make a clear alteration, and to retrench <hi>Nero</hi>'s profuſeneſs in gifts, and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant expences, he much miſt his aim and fell ſo ſhort of State, that he came not within the compaſs of decency. Poor <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> an excellent Muſician, playing all Supper time, receiv'd only a few Crowns from the Emperor's own hand; with a
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:36410:371"/>
large commendation, and this <hi>Item,</hi> that it was out of his own purſe, and not on the Publick account. Beſides he ordered <hi>Nero</hi>'s liberal largeſſes to Actors, Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and ſuch like, to be ſtrictly reman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, bating only the tenths, tho it turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to very ſmall account, moſt of thoſe Perſons expending their daily income, as faſt as receiv'd, being a diſſolute ſort of Men; he exacted alſo of thoſe that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd them, or made any advantage of 'em, to refund. The trouble was infinite, the profit running into many hands, the Emperour thereby baſely diſparaged, and <hi>Junius</hi> deſervedly hated and maligned, rendring <hi>Galba</hi> mean and deſpicable to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whilſt he only made advantage of all places and things about him. Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſatisfied as <hi>Heſiod</hi> hath it,

            <p>Thus the old Gentleman was abuſed by <hi>Junius</hi>'s male adminiſtration, either cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring or impeding all his juſt proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; ſuch was the puniſhing <hi>Nero</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, when he deſtroy'd the bad (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

whom were <hi>Elias Polycletus, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi> and <hi>Patrobius,</hi> the People mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applauded the act, crying out, as they were dragged through the Market place, <hi>This is a goodly ſhew, grateful even to the God's themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when the Gods, and Men deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded juſtice on <hi>Tigillinus, Nero</hi>'s great Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Manager of his Tyranny, <hi>Junius</hi> obſtructed it being roundly bribed by the Gentleman under hand: but <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> he could not permit to eſcape with life, tho he had done no great miſchief (only did neither betray nor envy <hi>Nero</hi> whilſt Emperor) but dealt far otherwiſe with him, that made him obnoxious, even worthy of death, and afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted and betrayed him whom he had ſo corrupted; a great inſtance that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> could do any thing; and that thoſe that had Money might deſpair of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. However the People were ſo fond of ſeeing <hi>Tigillinus</hi> dragged to Execution, that they never ceaſed to require it at the Theatre, and all publick Places till they were checked by an Edict of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, perſwading them that <hi>Tigillinns</hi> could not live long, being much waſted with a Conſumption, and deſired that they would not make his Government appear Cruel and Tyrannical. So the
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:36410:372"/>
diſſatisfied Mobile were laughed at, and <hi>Tigillinus</hi> made a ſplendid Feaſt and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed for his recovery. After Supper, <hi>Titus Junius</hi> riſing from the Emperour went to revel it with <hi>Tigillinus</hi> taking his Daughter, a Widow, with him, to whom <hi>Tigillinus</hi> preſented his Service with 250000 <hi>l.</hi> and commanded the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs of his Concubines to take off a rich Necklace from her own, and to tye it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout hers, valued at 150000 <hi>l.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his more moderate acts began to be cenſured, as alſo his dealing with the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who were in the Conſpiracy with <hi>Vindex;</hi> for they looked upon their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and abatement of Taxes, not ſo much the clemency of their Prince, as <hi>Junius</hi>'s profit. Hence many began to malign the Government. But the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were kept on a while, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the donative he promiſed, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that if they did not receive the full, yet at leaſt as much as <hi>Nero</hi> gave them. Afterwards <hi>Galba</hi> hearing they began to complain, declared greatly, and like a brave General, that he was uſed to make choice of, and not to buy his Souldiers, which when they heard of, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an implacable hatred againſt him, for he did not ſeem only to defraud 'em, and blaſt their preſent expectations, but
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:36410:373"/>
to give an ill precedent, and inſtruct his Succeſſors to do the like. Their heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burning, and caballing at <hi>Rome</hi> was as yet conceal'd, and that reverence they bore whil'ſt <hi>Galba</hi> was preſent, ſomewhat retarded their motions, and took off their edge, finding no probable ground for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, which ſomewhat curb'd their diſcontents for the preſent. Thoſe that had been formerly under <hi>Virginius,</hi> and now under <hi>Flaccus</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> valuing themſelves much upon the engagement with <hi>Vindex,</hi> and making no great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it, grew very refractory and intractable towards their Officers, and <hi>Flaccus</hi> they undervalued being much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpos'd and unſerviceable indeed by the Gout; beſides a Man of little experience in military Affairs.</p>
            <p>At one of their ſolemn Feſtivals, when it was cuſtomary for the Officers of the Army to wiſh all health and happineſs to the Emperour, the common Souldiers began to mutiny, but they continuing their good wiſhes cryed out, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it not, when the like inſolence was committed ſeveral times by <hi>Tigillinus</hi>'s forces, information was given <hi>Galba</hi> by the Procurators, whereupon ſuſpecting that he might be deſpiſed, not only for his old age, but alſo for want of iſſue, he
<pb n="719" facs="tcp:36410:373"/>
determined to adopt ſome young Man of quality, and declare him his ſucceſſor. <hi>Marc. Otho</hi> was in his thoughts, a Perſon of no mean extraction, but from his Childhood as ſcandalous as any for lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and debauchery, and as <hi>Homer</hi> terms <hi>Paris</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Fair <hi>Helen</hi>'s ſpruce Gallant, being remarkable for nothing elſe, his name was ſwallowed up in hers. So <hi>Otho</hi> was notoriouſly talked of for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than his Marriage with <hi>Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pea,</hi> whom <hi>Nero</hi> had a kindneſs for, when ſhe was <hi>Criſpinus</hi>'s Wife, but being as yet reſpectful to his own Lady, and paying a deference to his Mother, he engaged <hi>Otho</hi> under-hand to ſollicit her in his behalf. <hi>Nero</hi> you muſt know converſt familiarly with <hi>Otho,</hi> making uſe of his prodigality, and was well pleaſed, when he took the freedom to droll, on his thrifty, penurious humour, reflecting both in words and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; as when <hi>Nero</hi> one day perfum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with ſome rich eſſences fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured <hi>Otho</hi> with a ſmall ſprinkle, and he treating <hi>Nero,</hi> next day in a Bravado, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered gold and ſilver pipes to diſperſe the like on a ſudden freely, like a miſt throughout the room. As to <hi>Poppea,</hi> he was before hand with <hi>Nero,</hi> and anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his joys, and upon promiſe of <hi>Nero</hi>'s favour, prevailed with her to part with
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:36410:374"/>
her Husband, and brought her to his own houſe as his Spouſe, but was not content afterwards to have a ſhare in her, but grudged to have <hi>Nero</hi> for a Rival. <hi>Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pea</hi> in the mean time was not concern'd at this their jealouſie, and ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded <hi>Nero</hi> (when <hi>Otho</hi> was not preſent) either to make <hi>Nero</hi> the more ſharp, or, as ſome ſay, being weary of his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not approving a Marriage with him: However ſhe did not quite ſlight his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, being gameſome enough, and well inclined: On the account of this match, <hi>Otho</hi> was in danger of his Life, and ſtrange it was he eſcaped, <hi>Nero</hi> having taken off his Wife, and Siſter, to compaſs this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. But he was beholding to <hi>Seneca</hi>'s friendſhip, by whoſe perſwaſions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty <hi>Nero</hi> was prevailed with, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch him, <hi>Proproetor,</hi> into <hi>Luſitania,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea coaſt, where he behaved himſelf very obligingly towards all, full well knowing this command was but to colour and diſguiſe his baniſhment.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Galba</hi> revolted from <hi>Nero, Otho</hi> was the firſt Governour of any of the Provinces that came over to him, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Utenſils he had of Gold and Silver, which he preſented to the mint; and alſo what Servants he had, rightly qualified, to wait upon a Prince, in all
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:36410:374"/>
other points too he was faithful to him, and gave him ſufficient proof that he was inferior to none, in managing publick bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. By this time he had ſo far ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated himſelf, that he rode in the ſame Coach with him, the whole progreſs; and in his travels he mightily gained on <hi>Junius,</hi> both by his converſation, and preſents; but eſpecially by giving him the preference, he ſecured the next place, (by his intereſt) before all others. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he at all envyed, gratifying all Mens requeſts freely; appearing courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and of eaſie acceſs towards all, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Souldiers; many of whom he preferred to commands ſome of them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, by the Emperour; others by <hi>Junius</hi>'s means; craving the aſſiſtance of the two favourites <hi>Siculus</hi> and <hi>Aſiaticus.</hi> Theſe were the Men in Power in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relating to Court: As oft as he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>Galba,</hi> he gave his Guards, beſides their own Pay Crowns a piece, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of reſpect to the Emperor, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with an intent to inveagle the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and ſo out-do him in his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galba</hi> conſulting about a Succeſſor <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> introduced <hi>Otho,</hi> yet not gratis, but upon promiſe he would marry his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if he were made his adopted Son,

and Succeſſor to the Empire; but <hi>Galba</hi> always declared, that he preferred the publick good, before his own private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, not aiming ſo much to pleaſure himſelf, as to advantage the <hi>Romans.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he did not ſeem ſo much as inclined to make choice of <hi>Otho,</hi> to inherit his own private fortune, knowing his extravagant laviſh humour, and that he was already dipt 50000 <hi>l.</hi> thick. <note place="margin">

            <p>So he gave <hi>Junius</hi> the hearing, but calmly ſuſpended his determination with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving any anſwer, only appointed him Conſul, and <hi>Junius</hi> his Colleague; it was the general Opinion, that he would declare him his Succeſſor, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the next year. Now the Army deſired nothing more than that <hi>Otho</hi> ſhould be the Perſon; but the Forces in <hi>Germany</hi> falling into a Mutiny whilſt he was deliberating, prevented his deſign, for the Souldiers in general, had a pique againſt <hi>Galba,</hi> not having given them their expected largeſs, yet they made a pretence of a more particular concern, as that <hi>Virginius Rufus</hi> was caſt off diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, and that the <hi>Gauls</hi> who engaged with them were well rewarded, the reſt being puniſhed that joyned not with <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex;</hi> to whom alone <hi>Galba</hi> paid his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, and honoured his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory

after his death with publick Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, as tho he had been conſtituted Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, by his means only.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe diſcourſes paſt openly throughout the Army; on the firſt of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, Flaccus</hi> ſummoning 'em to take the anniverſary Oath of Fealty to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, they threw down <hi>Galba</hi>'s Statues, and utterly defaced them, afterwards ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſworn, in the name of the Senate and People, they departed.</p>
            <p>But their Commanders now feared A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and Confuſion, as much as their Apoſtacy and Rebellion: whereupon one of them ſtepping forth thus accoſted them:</p>

Which motion whilſt ſome aſſented to, and others gainſaid; a certain Enſign ſlip'd out, and carried the News to <hi>Vitellius,</hi> whilſt he was treating much company by Night. This taking air, ſoon paſt through the Army; and <hi>Fabius Valens</hi> a principal Commander, riding before his full Troops next day, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted <hi>Vitellius</hi> Emperor. He ſeemed to decline it, pretending a dread he had to undertake the Weight of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but the next day by noon being well incouraged by a plentiful repaſt; he began to yield, and ſubmitted to take on him the Title of <hi>Germanicus,</hi> they gave him; but deſired to be excuſed, as to that of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> immediately <hi>Flaccus</hi>'s Soldiers laying aſide their ſpecious popular Oaths, impoſed by the Senate, they ſwore obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to <hi>Vitellius</hi> as Emperor, and to obſerve whatever commanded. Thus <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius</hi> was publickly owned Emperor in <hi>Germany;</hi> which News coming to <hi>Galba</hi>'s Ear, he no longer deferred his adoption; yet knowing many of his Friends were inclined to <hi>Dolabella,</hi> but more to <hi>Otho</hi> (neither of whom he well approved of)
<pb n="725" facs="tcp:36410:376"/>
on a ſudden without any ones privity, he ſent for <hi>Piſo,</hi> who was nearly related to <hi>Craſſus,</hi> and <hi>Piſo</hi> (whom <hi>Nero</hi> ſlew) in whoſe natural temper eminently appeared much modeſty and gravity, and indeed all virtuous inclinations. Going then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Camp, he declared him his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor to the Empire. But immediately ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prodigious Omens appeared from Heaven; and when he began to make a Speech to the Souldiers, the frequent Claps of Thunder, and flaſhes of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and a diſmal black ſtorm covering both the Camp and City, were plain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, that the Heavens did not favour this adoption. The Souldiers alſo ſeemed diſſatisfied by their ſullen looks; ſeeing nothing of the wonted diſtributions, on ſuch occaſions. Thoſe that were preſent and obſerved <hi>Piſo</hi>'s Countenance and Voice admired to ſee him no more ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, tho he ſeemed not inſenſible of ſo great a favour.</p>
            <p>On the other hand <hi>Otho</hi> appeared full of ſadneſs and diſturbance at his diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, as being once thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and e'en ready to be inveſted in his good Fortune, and now to be put by was a ſhrewd ſign of the diſpleaſure and ill will of <hi>Galba</hi> toward him. This filled him with fears and jealouſies, and grievouſly
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:36410:377"/>
perplexed his Mind, whilſt he dreaded <hi>Piſo,</hi> hated <hi>Galba,</hi> and was full of wrath and indignation againſt <hi>Junius.</hi> But the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and South-ſayers about him, would not permit him to lay aſide his hopes, or quit his deſign, chiefly <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus,</hi> much relying upon a Prediction, that <hi>Nero</hi> ſhould not murder him, but he himſelf ſhould die firſt, and <hi>Otho</hi> ſucceed as Emperor. Now the firſt proving true, he thought he ought not diſtruſt the reſt; but none exaſperated him more, than thoſe that ſeemed privately to pity his hard Fate, to be ſo ungratefully dealt with by <hi>Galba,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Nymphidius</hi>'s and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillinus</hi>'s Creatures, who were now caſt off, and reduced to their former ſtate; theſe ſeemed highly to reſent this indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity put upon him; amongſt whom were <hi>Veturius</hi> and <hi>Barbius,</hi> the one termed <hi>Optio,</hi> (the Captain aſſiſtant) the other <hi>Teſſerarius,</hi> the Perſon intruſted with ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Watch, and giving the Word: Amongſt them <hi>Onomaſtus,</hi> one of <hi>Otho</hi>'s Freemen went to the Camp to tamper with the Army, and brought over ſome with Money, others with fair promiſes, which was eaſily done, they being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy corrupted, and only wanting a fair pretence; it had been otherwiſe, more than the work of Four days (which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:36410:377"/>
betwixt the Adoption and Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre) thus totally to have infected a ſound Army, ſo as to cauſe a general revolt. They were aſlaſſined <hi>Feb.</hi> 15. on which Day in the Morn, <hi>Galba</hi> Sacrificed in his Palace, in the Preſence of his Friends, when <hi>

            <p>Thus <hi>Otho</hi> had e'en been diſcovered by the Finger of God; but being juſt behind <hi>Galba,</hi> attending diligently to the South-ſayers Lecture, his countenance changed for fear, and he betrayed no ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; which <hi>Onomaſtus</hi> obſerving, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him that one of the Maſter Builders waited for him at home: (now that was the ſignal for <hi>Otho</hi> to meet the Souldiers) pretending then, that he had purchaſed an old houſe, and was going to ſhew the defects to thoſe that ſold it: he departed and paſſing by <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s houſe (as they called it) he ſtept into the Market Place, nigh the Golden Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, where all the ſeveral <hi>Italian</hi> ways center, where 'tis reported no more than twenty five received him, and ſaluted him Emperor; which put him to a ſtand,

tho not out of any effeminacy, being in his nature bold, and hardy enough; in hazardous adventures; but the Soldiers that were preſent, would not ſuffer him to recede; but with their drawn Swords about his Chair, commanded the Bearers to take him up, whom he haſtned on, though in the mean time, he ſaid to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I am a loſt Man. Thoſe who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard him, rather admired than were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at the inconſiderable number that attempted ſuch an enterpriſe. But, as they marched on, about as many more met him, and here and there three or four at a time adjoyned themſelves. Thus returning towards the Camp, with their Arms in their hands, they cryed out a <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> a <hi>Caeſar;</hi> whereupon one <hi>Martius,</hi> who commanded the Guards, who was no ways privy to it, being ſurprized at the unexpectedneſs of the thing, permitted him entrance; and afterwards no Man made any reſiſtance, for they that knew nothing of the deſign, being purpoſely encompaſſed by the Conſpirators, as they were ſtragling here and there: firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The Mobile ran con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed from the Market upon the report; but <hi>Junius Lacon,</hi> and ſome of his Free-men guarded him, with their drawn Swords, <hi>Piſo</hi> inſtantly made to the band of Pentioners, who were the Royal Guard. <hi>Marius Celſus,</hi> that ſtout Man, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to the <hi>Illyrian</hi> Squadron, who were planted at <hi>Vipſanus,</hi> to ſecure that Poſt. <hi>Galba</hi> now conſulting whether he ſhould quit his Palace, <hi>Junius</hi> diſſwading him, but <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Lacon</hi> encouraged him by all means to come forth; and ſharply reprimanded <hi>Junius</hi> for his pains. But on a ſudden a rumour came hot that <hi>Otho</hi> was ſlain in the Camp; immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared one <hi>Julius Atticius,</hi> an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Officer of the Guard with his drawn Sword, crying out, that he had ſlain great <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Enemy; and preſſing through the Crowd that ſtood in his way, he preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf before <hi>Galba</hi> with his bloody Weapon; who looking on him, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who commanded him ſo to do? My fidelity, ſays he, and the Oath I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be true to the Emperor. Which action when the People applauded, giving loud acclamations, <hi>Galba</hi> was carryed out in his Chair to ſacrifice to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:36410:379"/>
ſo to ſhew himſelf publickly; but coming into the Market Place (the tide being turned) a report met him that <hi>Otho</hi> had made himſelf Maſter of the Camp; but as uſually in ſuch a Crowd, ſome called to him to return back, others to move for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſome encouraged him to be bold and fear nothing; others to be cautious, and diſtruſt his circumſtances: Thus whilſt his Chair was toſt to and fro, (as it were on the waves) often tottering, there appear'd firſt Horſe, and ſtraightways Foot, fromwards <hi>Paulus</hi>'s Portico with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord crying out; down with this private Man; at which the Rabble hurried confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly; not as if they intended to diſperſe, but to poſſeſs themſelves of the Porches, and bulks in the Market Place, as if it were to ſome ſtrange ſight in the Theatre. And as ſoon as <hi>Attilius Sarcelio</hi> overturned <hi>Galba</hi>'s Statue, they immediately fell to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen hoſtility, and threw their darts at <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi>'s Chair; but miſſing their aim, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked him nearer hand, with their naked Swords; and no Man offered to ſtand up in his defence, ſave only <hi>Sempronius Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrus;</hi> a Captain, the only Man of ſo many thouſands, that the Sun beheld that day, worthy the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, who though he had never been obliged by <hi>Galba,</hi> yet out of bravery and allegiance, he endeavour'd
<pb n="731" facs="tcp:36410:379"/>
to defend him from their inſolent aſſaults: firſt lifting up his commanding ſtaff, (with which they uſe to correct the Soldiers when diſorderly) he called aloud to the aggreſſors, charging 'em to forbear the Emperor: but preſently being invironed, he guarded a long time with his Sword till at length (having received many a wound) he grew weak in the harns and fairly dropt, and overthrowing <hi>Galba</hi>'s <note place="margin">

His aſſociates not ſuffering him to conceal this manly act, by their perſwaſion, piercing the head of this grave Prince, he marched twirling and flouriſhing with it, on his bloody Spear, like one of <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s frolick Prieſts. But when they brought the Head to <hi>Otho, Fellow Souldiers,</hi> ſays he, <hi>this is nothing vnleſs you ſhew me</hi> Piſo'<hi>s too,</hi> which was

Titus Junius</hi> was alſo diſpatched out of the way, who confeſſed himſelf privy to the Conſpiracy againſt <hi>Galba,</hi> only, he cryed out, that he dyed contrary to <hi>Otho</hi>'s pleaſure, and without his privity, however they cut off his Head and <hi>Lacon</hi>'s too, and brought 'em to <hi>Otho,</hi> requeſting a boon; and as <hi>Archilochus</hi> ſays; When ſix or ſeven lay breathleſs on the ground, 'twas I, 'twas I, ſay thouſands, gave the wound. Thus many that had no hand in his murder with bloody Hands and Swords preſented <hi>Otho</hi> with their Petition for a gratuity, whom <hi>Vitellius</hi> found out after, to the number of one hund. and twenty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited with the loſs of life. Not long after came <hi>Marius Celſus</hi> into the Camp, whom ſundry accuſed of encouraging the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to aſſiſt <hi>Galba;</hi> the Rabble required juſtice, but <hi>Otho</hi> refuſing to gratifie their fury; yet fearing an abſolute denial, he pretended it was not his intereſt, to take him off ſo ſoon, having many matters yet to ſift out of him, but committed him ſafe to the cuſtody of thoſe he moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="733" facs="tcp:36410:380"/>
Forthwith a Senate was conven'd, and as if they were not the ſame Men, or had other Gods to ſwear by, they took an Oath in <hi>Otho</hi>'s name (as himſelf had in <hi>Galba</hi>'s, which how religiouſly he kept it plainly appears,) and withal conferred on him the Titles of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> whilſt the dead Carkaſſes of the ſlain lay yet in their Robes in the Market Place. As for their heads, when they could make no other uſe of them, <hi>Junius</hi>'s they ſold to his Daughter for 2500 drachma's. <hi>Piſo</hi>'s was begg'd by his Wife of one <hi>Veranius. Galba</hi>'s they gave to <hi>Patrobius</hi>'s and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius</hi>'s Servants; but when they had 'em, after all ſorts of abuſe and indignities, they tumbled them into that vile place, where <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Enemies that ſuffer death, <note place="margin">Quod ab urbe Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertio mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liari di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat.</note> are uſually caſt, called <hi>Seſtertium.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Galba</hi>'s Body was conveighed away by <hi>Priſcus Helvidius</hi> by <hi>Otho</hi>'s permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and buried in the night by <hi>Argius</hi> his Freeman. Thus you have the Hiſtory of <hi>Galba,</hi> a Perſon inferiour to few <hi>Romans,</hi> either for Birth or Riches, rather exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all of his time in both; he lived in great credit and reputation in the Reign of five Emperors, he ruined <hi>Nero</hi> rather by his fame and vogue in the World, than by force and Power.</p>

Of thoſe that put in for the Empire, at that time, none judged any worthy (tho ſome thought themſelves ſo) ſave only <hi>Galba</hi> whom they elected, and created Emperor, whoſe authority was ſuch, that but lending his name to <hi>Vindex</hi>'s defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from <hi>Nero,</hi> what was called Rebellion before, was termed now only a Civil War, they being tranſported with the thoughts of a Perſon fit to Govern.

            <p>THE New Emperor <hi>Otho</hi> about break of day went out to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in the Capitol, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <hi>Marius Celſus</hi> to be brought to him, he took him and embraced him in his Arms, uſing kind ſpeeches, and adviſing him rather to forget the cauſe of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, than to remember his enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: To which <hi>Celſus</hi> reply'd ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and ſharply, that his Crime would
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:36410:383"/>
give an aſſurance of his integrity, and be ſecurity for his behaviour, for that it was imputed to him, as a Crime, that he had been faithful to <hi>Galba,</hi> and yet no favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite: Upon this they were both admired by thoſe that were preſent, and applauded by the whole Camp.</p>
            <p>After he had made a long Oration in the Senate, wherein he diſcourſed of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things with great popularity, he began to ſettle the affairs of State, and therefore as to the remainder of his own Conſul-ſhip, that part he committed to the care of <hi>Virginius Rufus</hi> his Colleague; but as to others deſigned for that Office by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> or <hi>Galba</hi> he made no change. The grave and reverend among the People ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of age or dignity, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with the Prieſthood; And for thoſe Senators who had been baniſhed by <hi>Nero,</hi> and returned under <hi>Galba,</hi> to them he reſtored, what was left undiſpoſed of their Fortunes. Inſomuch that the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry, who at firſt had great fears and jealouſies upon them, (imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that it was not an humane Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but ſome fury or bloody Fiend that was ſeizing the Empire) now became more pleaſant, being ſweetned with the hopes of a Reign that ſeemed to ſmile up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="737" facs="tcp:36410:383"/>
At the ſame time nothing was ſo well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, nothing gained him the hearts of all the <hi>Romans</hi> ſo as the buſineſs of <hi>Tigil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus,</hi> a Man that lay under all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Soul and Body, for he was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the very fear of puniſhment, which the whole City exacted as a debt due to publick Juſtice; and he laboured likewiſe under incurable diſeaſes of Body, which he had contracted by his inſatiable luſt with corrupt Women, a vice that raigned in him to the laſt moment of his Life: And though wiſemen thought this vice together with its fatal conſequences to be puniſhment enough, and equal with many deaths, yet it grieved the People, that he ſhould enjoy the benefit of the Sun, when ſo many and ſuch brave Men had been deprived of it by his means. Wherefore <hi>Otho</hi> ſent after him into the Country of <hi>Simerſa,</hi> where he lurked with ſeveral Veſſels ready to carry him off up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any danger; He attempted to corrupt the Meſſenger that apprehended him, and offer'd great ſums of money for his eſcape, and though his attempts were in vain, yet he gave the ſame reward as if he had eſcaped; but withal he intreated him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to tarry a little till he was ſhaved, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he took the Razor and cut his own throat. Thus did <hi>Caeſar</hi> gratifie the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:36410:384"/>
by doing juſtice to the publick, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt diſcovery of his own private revenge.</p>
            <p>At firſt out of a popular humour he did not decline the Name and Title of <hi>Nero,</hi> but was ſaluted ſo in the Theater; neither did he oppoſe them that brought out <hi>Nero</hi>'s Statues to open view: Nay far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Claudius Rufus</hi> tells us, that ſeveral Patents were ſent expreſs into <hi>Spain,</hi> wherein the famous Name of <hi>Nero</hi> was uſed as an additional Title to the Name of <hi>Otho:</hi> Not but that as ſoon as he found it offenſive to the Nobility he left it off.</p>
            <p>In this manner he began to lay the foundations of his Government, when his guards grew diſcontented, adviſing him not to confide in the Nobility, but rather to withdraw himſelf, and forbid them his preſence. This they did, either out of good will as being really afraid, or out of deſign to ſet the Empire in a Combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
            <p>But this is certain touching <hi>Criſpinus,</hi> (who with the <hi>17th.</hi> Band had orders to apprehend certain ſuſpected Perſons) as he was loading his Waggon by Night with Arms and Ammunition, ſome of the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt among the Souldiers cryed out, that <hi>Criſpinus</hi> had no good intentions in this Act, that the Senate was hatching New
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:36410:384"/>
Plots, and that thoſe arms were prepared againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> not for him. This report being given out among the common Souldiers, it ſet them all on fire, that ſome laid hands on the Carriage, and others ſlew <hi>Criſpinus</hi> himſelf with two more <hi>Centurians</hi> which oppoſed them; and all falling to their Arms, and incouraging each other to aſſiſt the Emperor, marched furiouſly to <hi>Rome;</hi> and having intelligence that fourſcore of the Senate were at Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the Palace they went on thither; declaring that now was the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they might at once take off all <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Enemies. This put the City into a great conſternation, as if they were to be ſack'd immediately; In the Court they did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but run up and down, and even <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho</hi> himſelf was not a little perplexed; fearing his gueſts, and fearful for them; whom he ſaw with Eyes fixed upon him ſpeechleſs and trembling, ſome having brought their Wives a long with them to ſupper. Whereupon at the ſame inſtant he ordered the Captains of the Guard to pacifie and entertain the Souldiers with fair ſpeeches, while the Gueſts roſe from Table, and were let out at another door. They were but juſt eſcaped when the Guard preſs'd into the Room; asking what was become of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Enemies?
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:36410:385"/>
               <hi>Otho</hi> then riſing and addreſſed himſelf to them, ſparing neither words, entreaties, nor tears, and yet he could ſcarce perſwade them to go back. On the morrow after he had beſtowed a Largeſs of fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Drachmes a Man, he went into the Camp; where he took occaſion to commend the Loyalty and readineſs of the Souldiers in general. But withal telling them that there were ſome few diſaffected Perſons amongſt them, who had abuſed his Clemency and their Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and therefore deſires that they would aſſiſt him in the puniſhing of them, all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and conſented to this motion, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he himſelf was well ſatisfied in the Execution of two Villains only, ſuch as no body could lament. The Publick Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of theſe proceedings was various, ſome who already began to love and credit him, were full of wonder at ſuch a change: Some again looked upon it as a ſeaſonable piece of policy made uſe of on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this juncture of affairs to win the People over to his ſide againſt the War.</p>
            <p>For now it was no longer doubted that <hi>Vitellius</hi> had aſſumed the Imperial Title and Command. Courriers came ſlocking in apace; ſome with Intelligence of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties falling into <hi>Vitellius:</hi> Others that the <hi>Pannonian, Dalmatian,</hi> and <hi>Myſian</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:36410:385"/>
and Forces ſided with <hi>Otho:</hi> And theſe were preſently ſeconded with kind Letters from <hi>Mutianus</hi> and <hi>Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi> the Generals over two puiſſant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, one in <hi>Syria</hi> and the other in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea.</hi> This ſet him up ſo, that he wrote to <hi>Vitellius</hi> adviſing him to keep within his private Station, and offering, beſides great treaſure, the freedom of the City where he might repoſe the reſt of his days in pleaſure and ſecurity. This at firſt was anſwered only in raillery; but being heated they fell to downright railing and libelling. 'Twas idle and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, though not without ground, to object thoſe faults from which neither could be excuſed. For which of theſe two exceeded in rioting and wantonneſs, which of them had leaſt experience in Arms, or which of them before they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped had been moſt oppreſſed with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and Debt, was a queſtion not eaſie to determine.</p>
            <p>Of the Prodigies and Apparitions that went about at this time; ſome were vouched only by report: But theſe were generally taken notice of, how the Statue of <hi>Victory</hi> Triumphant in the Capitol had let looſe the reins of her Chariot, as una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to hold them: And how that other of <hi>Caius Caeſar</hi> in the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Tiber</hi> without
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:36410:386"/>
either Earthquake or Whirlwind turned it ſelf from Weſt to Eaſt, which by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture fell out near the time when <hi>Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> publickly took upon him the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But none of theſe preſages moved the multitude like the accident of <hi>Tyber.</hi> It was indeed the ſeaſon when Rivers uſe to be full, but now it ſo ſwelled above its Banks, and made ſuch deſolation, over-flowing, and covering great part of the City, eſpecially about the Corn-Market, that it occaſion'd a ſore dearth for many days.</p>
            <p>When it became known that <hi>Vitellius</hi> his Captains <hi>Caecinna</hi> and <hi>Valens</hi> had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd themſelves of the <hi>Alpes, Dolabella,</hi> a <hi>Patrician</hi> then in <hi>Rome,</hi> was ſuſpected by the guard of attempting ſome inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations; therefore (whether fearing him, or any other) <hi>Otho</hi> ſent him with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his favour, to the City of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <hi>Otho</hi> himſelf ſtaid at <hi>Brixillum,</hi> a City on the River <hi>Po,</hi> but he ſent out the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, under the Conduct of <hi>Marcus Celſus, Suetonius, Paulinus, Gallus,</hi> and <hi>Spurina;</hi> Men of Conduct and Valour, but they had no Forces to put their own Counſels in Action, becauſe of the diſorders and inſolency of the Souldiers, who owning no other Captain than <hi>Caeſar,</hi> thought it beneath their quality to be commanded by any but himſelf. Neither were the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Troops much better diſciplined, or more tractable to their Officers, but heady and proud upon the ſame account. Only they were well train'd, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to labour, which they could away with. But theſe <hi>Praetorians</hi> were grown perfectly effeminate by Idleneſs and want of exerciſe, having ſpent moſt of their time in Sights, Entertainments and Plays. And yet they were ſo puffed up with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and arrogance, that they challenged their Reward as the beſt, when their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was of the worſt. <hi>Spurina</hi> once would have forced them upon Duty, but it brought his perſon in danger, and had almoſt coſt him his Life. Beſides, they
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:36410:387"/>
ſpared for no ſort of outrage and ill lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, calling him Traitor, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him with ill Conduct, to the ruine of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and his Affairs; ſome of them moreover in a Debauch, preſs'd into his Tent, demanding a Paſs while they went to make complaint againſt him to the Emperour.</p>
            <p>But the Reproaches of the <hi>Vitellians</hi> at <hi>Placentia,</hi> did not a little help the Cauſe, and <hi>Spurina</hi> too for the preſent. For they marching ſtrait up to the works, upbraided <hi>Otho</hi>'s Men upon the Walls, terming them expert Actors, Dancers, and Spectators of harmleſs Exerciſes, but ſtrangers to martial Diſcipline, and the Art of War; Men that valued themſelves for beheading a naked gray-Beard (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Galba)</hi> but had not the Heart to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the open Field with Men at Arms: Which Scoffs ſo nettled and heated them, that falling down at <hi>Spurina</hi>'s feet, they beſought him to make uſe of them, and command them, that would ſtick at no pains or peril. So, when the Walls were aſſaulted very ſtrongly, and many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines of Battery were brought up, <hi>Spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s men got the day, and having beat off the Enemy with great ſlaughter, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved one of the moſt flouriſhing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Cities in <hi>Italy.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="745" facs="tcp:36410:387"/>
As to all other points, <hi>Otho</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders were much leſs burdenſome both to Cities and private Men, than thoſe of <hi>Vitellius,</hi> of whom <hi>Caecinna</hi> was no ways acceptable in ſpeech or behaviour, but uncouth and diſagreeable, of a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous bigneſs, dreſs'd after the Gallick mode, in <hi>Doublet</hi> and <hi>Breeches,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that faſhion he convers'd with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Officers.</p>
            <p>His Lady too in a magnificent Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page follow'd the Camp on horſeback, with a choice Guard of Cavaliers. As to <hi>Fabius Valens,</hi> the other General, neither the Enemies Spoil, nor Countries Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, nor the Confederates Contribution were able to ſatisfie his Avarice. Yet for the Collection hereof, he was by ſome concluded ſo to ſlacken his March, that he could not come up at the former skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh; while others blame <hi>Caecinna</hi> of charging too ſoon, that he might have the honour of the day to himſelf; and whereas before he had given diſtaſte by ſome miſcarriages, now by joyning Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel with ſo little Conduct and Courage, he had almoſt ruin'd his Party.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caecinna,</hi> after this repulſe from <hi>Placen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> carried the Siege to <hi>Cremona,</hi> another flouriſhing and large City; while <hi>Annius Gallus</hi> in his March to relieve <hi>Spurina</hi> in
<pb n="746" facs="tcp:36410:388"/>
               <hi>Placentia,</hi> meeting upon the way with intelligence both of that Action, and the diſtreſs of <hi>Cremona,</hi> wheel'd about, and pitch'd down cloſe by the Enemy; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, every one came into aid the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. But when <hi>Caecinna</hi> had laid a ſtrong party in wait among certain uneven Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, ordering the Horſe to advance, and after the firſt Charge to make a ſlow Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat till they might draw the Enemy within the Ambuſcade, certain Deſerters diſcover'd it to <hi>Celſus,</hi> who charging them briskly, and purſuing them warily, came upon the <hi>Ambuſcade,</hi> which he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded, and broke in pieces, ſending away for the Infantry out of the Camp: Which if it had arrived in time to ſecond the Horſe, it is more than probable that the Enemies could not have ſaved a man of <hi>Caecinna</hi>'s whole Army from being cut off, or trodden under foot. But <hi>Paulinus</hi> coming up late and ſlowly with his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, was not undeſervedly taxed of too much circumſpection for one of his Character. The common Souldiers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly accuſed him of abſolute Treaſon, exaſperating <hi>Otho</hi> againſt him, and boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Enemy was defeated; but if the Victory was not entire, he might thank his Captains. <hi>Otho,</hi> though he gave Credit to theſe Suggeſtions, yet
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:36410:388"/>
would not ſeem to diſtruſt his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; therefore he ſent to the Army his Brother <hi>Titianus,</hi> as General, with <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi> Captain of the Guard, who indeed had the Power, and <hi>Titianus</hi> only the Name. <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Paulinus</hi> had the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Coucellors and Friends, but ſhared nothing of the management.</p>
            <p>All things likewiſe were full of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion among the Enemies, paticularly in <hi>Valens</hi>'s Camp, who hearing of the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter at the <hi>Ambuſcade,</hi> grew out of all patience that they ſhould not be there to relieve ſo many brave perſons as fell upon the ſpot: So that <hi>Valens</hi> having much ado to perſwade and keep them from revenging it upon himſelf, was ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to diſlodge, and join with <hi>Caecinna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Otho</hi> arrived at <hi>Bebriacum,</hi> a Village near <hi>Cremona,</hi> to conſult about giving Battel. <hi>Proculus</hi> and <hi>Titianus</hi> were for fighting, while the Souldiers were in heart with their late ſucceſs, and not by ſitting ſtill, to blunt their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and give <hi>Vitellius</hi> leiſure to come upon them out of <hi>Gaul; Paulinius,</hi> on the contrary, affirm'd, that the Enemies whole force was there without the leaſt recruit, whereas <hi>Otho</hi> might expect an Army out of <hi>Myſia</hi> and <hi>Pannonia,</hi> no whit inferiour to that in the Field, if he would
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:36410:389"/>
but ſtay his own time, and not ſerve his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies occaſions, neither was it likely that the Spirit of thoſe few Souldiers ſhould be leſſened by the encreaſe of more For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but rather that the ſupply would add to their aſſurance. Over and above this, delay made for the <hi>Othonians,</hi> who lived at home in abſolute plenty, while the <hi>Vitellians,</hi> lodging in an enemies coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, muſt encreaſe their wants with their ſtay. <hi>Celſus</hi> concurr'd with <hi>Paulinus. Annius Gallus</hi> was abſent, and under cure by a fall from his Horſe. Yet <hi>Otho,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting him by Letter, received the ſame adviſe, not to be forward, but wait the <hi>Myſian</hi> Forces, which were already on the March. However, <hi>Otho</hi> deaf to theſe, inclined to that ſide which held for a Battel.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral Reaſons given for this Reſult, in which few men agree. this is plainly one; The <hi>Praetorians</hi> and the Life-guard (having then a taſte of War in good earneſt, and ſo much the more lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring after the delicacies and quiet diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>Rome)</hi> could not be kept in, cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring for a Fight, as if at the very firſt courſe they had been able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run their Enemies. Neither did <hi>Otho</hi> himſelf ſeem tough enough to hold out in ſuch uncertainty; or (ſo ſoft, ſo little
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:36410:389"/>
us'd was he) to ſtruggle with thoughts of ſuch danger; but, quite broke with care, he ſhut his eyes, as one that leaps from a Precipice, and ſpurr'd on to truſt Fortune with his All. This Account gives <hi>Secundus</hi> the Orator, and Secretary to <hi>Otho.</hi> According to ſome other Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it was more than once moved in both Armies to joyn, and eſpecially that with one conſent they might elect the beſt of the Captains then preſent, or in caſe of diſagreement, to call a Senate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place, and ſubmit the choice of the Emperour to them. Neither is it unlikely that the right, experienced, and underſtanding Souldiers (having no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary favour for either of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting Emperours) might fall upon ſuch projects. For what could be more dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and grievous, than wilfully to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace thoſe miſeries which the <hi>Romans</hi> groan'd under long ago, while they were cutting of Throats for <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> and ſince that, for <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey;</hi> only that the Empire might ſerve the Gluttony and Drunkenneſs of <hi>Vitellius,</hi> or the Luxury and Tenderneſs of <hi>Otho?</hi> It is ſuppoſed, that <hi>Celſus</hi> out of ſome ſuch meaning ſought to ſpin out the time, as hoping to decide the point without the pains of an Encounter, as on the contrary,
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:36410:390"/>
that <hi>Otho</hi> ſuſpecting his Deſign, made haſte to engage.</p>
            <p>Upon this Reſolve <hi>Otho</hi> himſelf return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back to <hi>Brixillum</hi> by another grand Miſtake, not only in withdrawing his preſence from the eyes of his Champions, who did even adore and dote on him; but in carrying back for his Horſe and Foot-Guard, the ſtouteſt and moſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute of his Men, he plainly cut off the Body of his Army.</p>
            <p>About that time there happened a skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh at the River <hi>Po,</hi> which <hi>Caecinna</hi> ſought to paſs by a Bridge of Boats. <hi>Otho</hi>'s Men to oppoſe, yet gaining little by plain force, they threw Fire-brands daub'd with Pitch and Brimſtone into the Veſſels, which the Wind taking as they fell, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly kindled, and blew into the Faces of the Enemies; who being firſt troubled with the Smoke, and then with the Flame, leap'd into the Water, overturning the Floats, and expoſing their Bodies with deriſion to the Enemy. But the <hi>Germans</hi> attacking <hi>Otho</hi>'s Gladiators in a ſmall Iſland upon the River, defeated and cut off a great Party. Whereupon, the <hi>Otho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> that-were at <hi>Bebriacum,</hi> being tranſported with fury to revenge it, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi> led them forth about fifty furlongs before he encamped; and withall ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:36410:390"/>
and ridiculouſly, that even in the Spring, and the Fields round about full of Rivalets and Currents, yet they were diſtreſſed for Water. On the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, when he would have led them at leaſt twice as far againſt the Foe, <hi>Paulinus</hi> put a ſtop, declaring in his opinion, that they ought rather to keep their Station, and not harraſs themſelves, nor juſt upon a long March with their Baggage, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Enemy, that would be armed and ranged at leiſure. In the midſt of this Diſpute among the Commanders, a <hi>Numidian</hi> came poſt from <hi>Otho,</hi> bringing Orders, without ſtop or ſtay to lead ſtrait upon the Enemy, which incontinently they did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caecinna</hi> was ſurprized at the News of their approach, and leaving haſtily his Works at the River, he return'd into the Camp. <hi>Valens</hi> having poſted great part of his Army, and given the Word, ſent out a choice forlorn of Horſe to amuſe the Enemy, whilſt he drew up the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Otho</hi>'s Van were poſſeſs'd with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from a flying Report, that <hi>Vitellius</hi> his Captains would come over to them. Therefore, when they drew near, they ſaluted them by the friendly Term of Fellow-Souldiers; which not being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the others with Civility, but
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:36410:391"/>
with an angry hoſtile Murmur, both diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them that had given the Salute, and fill'd the reſt with ſuſpicion of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. This began a diſorder at the very firſt Charge, which was ſpread through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Field, not a little confounded by the cumberſome Carriages; they receiv'd alſo no ſmall diſadvantage from the place of Battel, full of Ditches and Trenches; to avoid which, they were forc'd to change their Order, and fight one among another as they could compaſs it in little Parties, Two only Legions, that called <hi>Rapax,</hi> for <hi>Vitellius,</hi> and <hi>Adjutrix,</hi> for <hi>Otho,</hi> being drawn out in a Champaign, fought fairly a long time. <hi>Otho</hi>'s Men were luſty and valiant, but in their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prenticeſhip; <hi>Vitellius</hi>'s old and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Souldiers. <hi>Otho</hi>'s Men therefore charged hotly, gained ground, knock'd down the formoſt, and took one of their Eagles: Shame and Rage drave the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers back upon them again, and with the death of <hi>Orphidius,</hi> the Collonel, they ſurprized divers of <hi>Otho</hi>'s Eagles in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for their own. The Gladiators, Men of no ſmall credit for Courage and Addreſs, were attack'd by <hi>Varus Alphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s <hi>Batavians,</hi> the Flower of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Horſe, which were drawn from the Iſlands of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> in the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
<pb n="753" facs="tcp:36410:391"/>
A few of the <hi>Gladiators</hi> ſtood their ground; but the groſs making away for the River, fell into an Ambuſcade, which cut them off every man. But of the whole Army, none came near the <hi>Praeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> for Cowardice; they took their heels without a ſtroke ſtruck, and flying through their own Men, with trouble and affright routed the Squadrous that ſtood firm. They did not all ſo indeed; for many of the <hi>Othonians</hi> bare down their Oppoſites, and by fine force ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king way through the Conquerors, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd to their Camp; which neither <hi>Proculus</hi> nor <hi>Paulinus</hi> durſt retreat to, fearing the Souldiers, who already turn'd the fault upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Annius Gallus</hi> received the flying Troops into the Town, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened them up with comfortable Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances, that the Victory was not clear to the Enemy, but that in ſeveral parts the advantage was on their ſide: But <hi>Marius</hi> calling the Officers to a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, required them to take care of the Common-wealth: That after ſuch a blow, and ſuch a ſlaughter of <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens, <hi>Otho</hi> himſelf, having any goodneſs left, would not further tempt Fortune; in a Caſe where <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> who by not ſubmitting to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> after the <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalian</hi>
               <pb n="754" facs="tcp:36410:392"/>
Victory, are charged to have thrown away the Lives of many good men in <hi>Africa</hi> without reaſon, even when the Liberty of <hi>Rome</hi> was at Stake. For though otherwiſe Fortune make ſport with all men alike, yet one thing a good man can never be deprived of, even in adverſity, to take good Counſel againſt Accidents. Theſe Reaſons weighed firſt with the Commanders; and after, upon trial, with the Souldiers, no leſs urgent for an Accommodation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Titianus</hi> then moved for Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners to be ſent with Propoſals of accord; whereupon, it was thought fit, that <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> and <hi>Gallus</hi> ſhould go to treat with <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinna</hi> and <hi>Valens.</hi> Being on the Rode, they were met by certain of <hi>Vitellius</hi>'s Centurions, who told them that their Army was already in motion for <hi>Bebria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> and that they themſelves were ſent by the Generals with like overtures of Peace. <hi>Celſus</hi> commending the Deſign, entreated their company back to meet <hi>Caecinna.</hi> As they drew near, <hi>Celſus</hi> ran no ſmall Risk; for the Vant-Couriers, happening to be the ſame Horſe that had been worſted at the Ambuſcade, upon the firſt ſight of <hi>Celſus,</hi> with a loud cry they ſpurr'd up againſt him: But while the Centurions ſtepp'd between to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
<pb n="755" facs="tcp:36410:392"/>
them, and their Captains alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out to forbear, <hi>Caecinna</hi> gallopp'd up to know the cauſe of that Tumult, which having appeas'd, he careſſed <hi>Celſus</hi> as a Friend, and rode with him to <hi>Bebriacum.</hi> In the mean time, <hi>Titianus</hi> repenting of his motion for Amity, placed the moſt reſolute of his Men upon the Walls, and exhorted the reſt to aſſiſt them. But <hi>Caecinna</hi> rode up, and reach'd out his right hand, all reſiſtance laid aſide, they that ſtood upon the Ramparts, ſaluted his Souldiers, the reſt opening the Gates, went out, and mixed with the new-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. There was then no further outrage, nothing but friendſhip and embraces; for all the Town ſwore Fealty to <hi>Vitellius,</hi> and went over to him.</p>
            <p>Such was the iſſue of the Battel, as it is related by moſt of the preſent Actors therein; yet confeſſing themſelves in ſuch Tumult and Confuſion to have no clear account of Particulars. So as I was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward travelling over the Field, <hi>Meſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Florus,</hi> of the Conſular Degree, ſhew'd me an old Man, who was then preſs'd for <hi>Otho</hi> among the Youths; who declared, that going out after the Action was over, he ſaw a heap of Bodies as high as a man, but the cauſe of it he could neither find out, nor learn by Enquiry: Only it is
<pb n="756" facs="tcp:36410:393"/>
probable that in Civil Wars more periſh in the Chaſe than are taken, where there is no benefit by Captives. Therefore all we can have either of theſe Matters, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to no more than Conjecture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Otho</hi> at firſt (as it is uſual) received a dubious relation of the Succeſs; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, the wounded, which eſcaped out of the Fight, brought him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain news of the Defeat, a man would admire what pains they took to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and keep him from deſpair. But the paſſion of the Guards ſurmounts all Credit, that they ſhould neither leave him, nor fall off to the Conqueror, nor ſeem to provide for themſelves in their Prince's extremity; but all together came to the door of his A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>artment, ſtiling him Emperour. When he came abroad, they followed him with acclamations, as if he went in Triumph, they kiſſed his hands, after the manner of Petitioners, they threw themſelves at his feet, they ſhed tears, and with all the force of an humble and dutiful importunity, they beſought him not to forſake them, not to betray them to the Enemy, but while they had breath, to employ their Souls, and their Bodies in his Cauſe. Thus did they generally aſſault him with ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions In particular, one of the loweſt rank,
<pb n="757" facs="tcp:36410:393"/>
who has not ſo much as a Name in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, drew out his Sword, and calling aloud to him, <hi>Behold, Caeſar, an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our Fidelity, thus are we all reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſerve thee;</hi> he ran himſelf through. Yet none of all this made any impreſſion upon <hi>Otho;</hi> who with a ſerene and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed aſpect, caſting his eyes round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout upon them all, <hi>This, my Fellow Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, this day, wherein you do your ſelves and me ſuch honour, is much more fortunate, of much greater account to me, than that wherein you firſt ſaluted me Emperour. One thing only I prefer, which I beſeech you with-hold not from me, to ſacrifice my Life for the ſafety of ſuch brave Men. If ever I was worthy of the</hi> Roman <hi>Empire, it becomes me to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>evote my Life for it. I know the Enemies Victory to be neither compleat, nor aſſured. I have Intelligence that the</hi> Myſian <hi>Army is within a few days March;</hi> Aſia, Syria, Egypt <hi>are in their deſcent to the Coaſt of</hi> Adria. <hi>With us is the Army that wars in</hi> Judea; <hi>with us is the Senate; with us are the Wives and Children of the Enemies. But alas! this is no defenſive War; this is not to ſave</hi> Italy <hi>from</hi> Hannibal, <hi>or</hi> Pyrrhus, <hi>or the</hi> Cimbri; <hi>but here</hi> Romans <hi>encounter</hi> Romans, <hi>and both alike, the Conquerors and the Conquered tear up their Mothers
<pb n="758" facs="tcp:36410:394"/>
Bowels; for where indeed the ſucceſs of the Vanquiſher brings Affliction to the Re-pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; believe it, there can be nothing ſo much honour in my Reign, as in dying of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, if I could do it for my Country. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I apprehend how a Victory on my ſide can be of ſuch advantage to</hi> Rome, <hi>as to give up my ſelf an Offering for Peace and Concord, and that</hi> Italy <hi>may not ſe ſuch another day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he had ſaid this, and ſet himſelf againſt all Entreaty and Mediation, he deſired his Friends, and the Senators that were preſent, to leave him. He wrote alſo to the abſent, and ſent Letters to the Cities to let them paſs with Honour and Security.</p>
            <p>Then calling to him <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>cceius,</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, yet a youth; he counſelled him to take heart, and not to be afraid of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius,</hi> whoſe Mother, Wife, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren he had preſerved with the ſame care as if they had been his own; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>Caeſar</hi> deferr'd his Adoption, contrary to his mind, to ſave him from ſharing in his misfortunes, who being vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious, ſhould have ſhar'd with him in the Empire. But this, ſaid he, <hi>My Child, I leave thee for my last advice, neither to forget altogether, nor too much to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that thou hadst an Emperour for thine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="759" facs="tcp:36410:394"/>
A little after this, he heard a great Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult and Noiſe at the Door; for the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers threatened the death of ſome Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors that were going away, if they ſhould offer to depart and leave the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour: Therefore out of a fear of their Lives, he came out again, though in a very different manner, not with mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and entreaty as before, but with a ſtern and angry countenance looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Guard, and eſpecially the buſie Fellows, he made them leave the place, and ſlink away.</p>
            <p>Being athirſt towards Night, he drank a little Water, and taking up two Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, when he had tried their edges a great while, he gave back one, and put the other into<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Sleeve. After which, he call'd for his Domeſticks, very frankly diſtributing to them his Treaſrre; not alike indeed to all, nor as one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe of what was anothers, but care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in proportion to every ones deſert; who being gone, he ſlept the reſt of the Night ſo ſoundly, that the Bed-Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men heard him ſnoar. At Day-Light, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for his Freed-man, whom he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the care of the Senators. He ſent him to enquire what was become of them, and underſtanding that they were gone away very well ſatisfied; Go thy
<pb n="760" facs="tcp:36410:395"/>
ways too (ſaid he) and ſhew thy ſelf to the Souldiers, unleſs thou haſt a mind to be torn in pieces by them for having a hand in my death. When the man was gone forth, he ſet the Dagger right to his Breaſt with both his hands, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon it, felt only ſo much pain as to fetch one groan, which gave notice to his Attendants. At the out-cry of the Servants thereupon, preſently the City, yea, the whole Camp were in Tears: Strait there was a noiſe of Souldiers at the door, lamenting, and paſſionately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacing themſelves, that they had not kept their Emperour, and with-held him by force from deſtroying himſelf. Not a Man of them left him to ſeek their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, among the Enemies that were at hand; but having ſumptuouſly habited his Corps, and dreſs'd up his Funeral-Pile, the Souldiers in their Armour car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him forth with a ſenſe of honour and happineſs to have had a hand in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that laſt Office. Amongſt the reſt, ſome kneel'd down to kiſs the Wound, ſome his Hand, and ſome, that could not come near, to adore him. And ſome there were, who having ſet fire to the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral-Pile, ſlew themſelves, not, as it was known, out of any obligation of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, for good Offices done to them by
<pb n="761" facs="tcp:36410:395"/>
the deceaſed, nor out of fear of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from the Conquerour. Indeed I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver met with any Tyrant or Uſurper ſo furiouſly poſſeſſed with the Luſt of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, as theſe with the Love of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to <hi>Otho,</hi> which periſhed not with himſelf, but was kept alive with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable hatred to <hi>Vitellius;</hi> as in better opportunity it may be diſcovered. When they had buried his Remains, they ſet up ſuch a Monument as Envy it ſelf could not carp at, for the Magnificence either of its Work or Title. I my ſelf ſaw it at <hi>Brixillum,</hi> an ordinary Tomb, with this Inſcription (being tranſlated,) <hi>To the Memory of</hi> Marcus Otho.</p>
