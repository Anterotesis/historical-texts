            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Humble Addreſs, and hearty Deſires of the Gentlemen, Miniſters and Free-holders of the County of NORTHAMPTON.</head>
            <head type="sub">Preſented to his Excellency the Lord General <hi>MONK,</hi> at his arrival at <hi>Northampton,</hi>
               <date>January 24. 1659.</date>
            </head>
            <p>WEE the Gentlemen, Miniſters and Free-holders of the County of <hi>Northampton,</hi> humbly conceiving that the firſt Force put upon the Parliament hath been an Encouragement to open the way to all the reſt; and finding that your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie under God hath been the principal means for the repairing of the laſt Interruption, are the more encouraged, and (having the conveniency of your preſence now amongſt us) to deſire your aſſiſtance in the procuring theſe our juſt Deſires, as the viſible means of a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Peace and Settlement of theſe Nations.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That whereas every free-born Subject of <hi>England</hi> is ſuppoſed to be preſent in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Knights and Burgeſſes of the place where he liveth, and thereby is preſumed to conſent to all things that paſs in Parliament; So it is now, that there is not one Knight for all the Counties in <hi>Wales,</hi> nor for divers Counties in <hi>England,</hi> and ſome of them the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in <hi>England,</hi> as that of <hi>York-</hi>ſhire.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That no free-born Subject of <hi>England</hi> may have any Taxes levied upon him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his conſent in Parliament.</p>
            <p n="3">III. To that End, that all vacant places may be ſupplied, whether they became vacant by Death, or Secluſion; and that thoſe that were ſecluded by force in the year 1648. may ſit again; and that no previous Oath or Engagement may be put upon any that is choſen by his Countrey to ſit and Vote freely in Parliament.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That the Fundamental Laws of <hi>England,</hi> the Priviledges of Parliament, the Liberty of the Subject, and the Property of Goods, may be aſſerted and defended, according to the firſt Declarations of the Parliament, when they undertook the War.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That the true Proteſtant Religion may be profeſſed and defended, all Hereſies, Sects and Schiſmes diſcountenanced and ſuppreſſed, a lawfull ſucceſſion of Godly and Able Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters continued and encouraged, and the two Univerſities, and all Colledges in both of them, may be preſerved and countenanced.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. That all the Souldiery that will acquieſce in the Judgment of a free and full Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in the promoting and ſetling a happy Peace upon thoſe Foundations, may have their Arrears paid, and as many of them as the Parliament ſhall think neceſſary, may be continued in the publick Service; and that as many of them as have been Purchaſers of Lands from the Parliament, may either enjoy their Bargains, or their Money paid back with Intereſt, and ſome conſiderable Advantage over and above, for their ſatisfactions, as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſhall judge expedient for the publick good of the Nation.</p>
