            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

farther bothe manne and woman
manye tymes are charged and in
daunger to loue the rich, the faire,
and so prefer them before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good

begynning of Matrymony ought
to be frome prayer, in the whiche
suche as woulde marie shuld aske
of God, a godly companyon from
whom onely it is gyuen Prouer.
After diligente prayer shoulde be
like inquisition of what fayth the
partye is that is desyred in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymonye:
for as dyuersytye of
religyon betwene one man and
hys wyfe is daungerous, so is it
forbydden by God Deut. vii. Ios.
<pb facs="tcp:5152:5"/>
xxiii. Therfore Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the father
of the faythfulles bounde his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunte

whom we wyll, so it be in the
Lord, as it neuer can be where as
the persone to be Maryed abhor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rithe
(as saynt Ambrose sayth) the
autoure of Matrimonye. It is
not ynoughe for the man or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that wyl mary, to chose such
a one as beareth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of Christ,
but he or she must diligently serch
what the practyse and obedyence
<pb facs="tcp:5152:6"/>
of hys co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersation is to the name
of Christianite. And when suche a
one is founde, then chose and loue
honestlye, seke wyth the counsel of
thy wise frendes, and neglecte not
the suffragies, nor consente of the
parentes and frendes of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone
thou sekest: and commende
then, all the successe to God, and
desyre hys wyll to be done. Thys
is the onely way to begynne Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
if it shal euer prosper wel
But out alas howe farre be men

And in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of these

folowing of the same, as from

of the cauylacyons, where with

wote neare what.</p>
            <p>The occasyon why I haue
nowe sente you, this aforesaide
treatyse, called the seconde boke
of Tertulian, vnto hys wyfe:
And not rather translated hys
fyrste boke, in whiche he instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
hys wyfe, howe she shoulde
behaue herselfe, and order her
lyuing after hys death: Is that
in his sayde firste boke or trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyse,
he exhorteth her, for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynewe,
styll a widdowe in any

of her so earnestely, &amp; so straigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely,
that he (but in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no doubte

to affirme, and to go aboute, to
make her beleue, that yf she ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
againe with any man, she
shoulde commyt synne. But here
in thys other treatyse, he semeth
after my mynde, rather by decla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rynge
<pb facs="tcp:5152:10"/>
vnto her, what maner of
husbande, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she shoulde chose to

that after she were once free, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the yoke of matrymony, she had
not the gyfte of god, to folowe
S. Paules counsell, whiche is:
to abyde styl vnmaried, and not
to seke another husbande, yf she
wer once losyde from one, and
not in daunger of fornicacion,
thorow the burning incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye
of the corruptyble fleshe.</p>
            <p>But now I doubte not, but
that if some ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, should heare this
saide treatise reade vnto you: he
woulde saye by and by: what
madde fole sente this boke vnto
you, as a thynge that ye shoulde
folow? &amp;c. This exhortacion ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
for the christen wemen of
Tertulyans tyme, when they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habyted
the whole world ouer,
<pb facs="tcp:5152:11"/>
here aud there, amongest the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fideles
and heathen, and for
suche as do dwell amongest the
Turckes and Iewes, nowe in
our dayes: And not for any Uir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
or widdowes, in oure kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
grace hys realme, where as
be none other to take, but onely
christen, if a woman wyl mary,
any man at all. That is truth in
dede, yf all men were trew chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten,
that beare the holy name of
Chryste. But oure sauioure hym
selfe saythe Math .vii. Entre in
at the strayte gate for wyde is
the gate, and brode is the waye
that leadeth to distruccyon, and
many therbe which go in there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at.
But strayght is the gate, and
narrow is the waye whych lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vnto lyfe: and fewe therebe
that fynde it. Ite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: not euery one
that saith vnto me, Lord, Lord,

<pb facs="tcp:5152:11"/>
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but he that doth the wil
of my father, whiche is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
And saynt Paule, speaking
of the false chrysten, I meane
such, as be but chrysten in name
only. Unto Titus .i. Saith: they
professe that they knowe God
(wyth theyr mouthe, &amp; by theyr
outwarde vse, of the sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
and ceremonies, the Apostle
meaneth no doubte) but wyth
theyr dedes they denye him: In
as muche as they bee abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
lyuers, and not obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto
goddes worde, but reprobate
persones, as touching any good
woorkes. It is good to thincke
then, that the man of God, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
toke such for no better, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the heathen: Specyally seyuge
that hys mayster, and Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, sayth further, that at
the laste daye, he wyll saye vnto
such, christen disciples of hys: de
<pb facs="tcp:5152:12"/>
parte from me, an ye that worke
Iniquitie: I knowe you not. &amp;c.
Mat .vii. And who I pray you,
shoulde better knowe, who bee
the trewe chrysten, and chrystes
disciples in dede, then our saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Iesus himselfe? which saith
Ioh .viii. If ye shal abyde in my
worde, then shall ye be my disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in dede. Item. Ioh .xv. He
that abideth in me, and I i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him,
bryngeth fourthe muche frute.
&amp;c. Then they that bryng forth,
no frutes of rightuousnes at al:
but lie still lyke swyne, wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in theyr voluptuousnes, or
els lyke cruell dogges, do barke
at, and persecute the trewe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne
of Chryste, whyche they
knowe not, bee none of chrystes
discyples, and therfore, no trew
christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; worse then
infidels, in the syght of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
god. Yea, and so bee all suche
<pb facs="tcp:5152:12"/>
to, as do contynuallye sryll from
day to day, walke or lye, in their
foruicacion, adulterie, dronke n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
glotonye, extorcion, intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
vserie, inordinat coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse,
blynde superstici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and wiked Idolatrye, wyth
suche lyke vyces, as S. Paule
sayth .i. Cor. vi. and Ephe .v. For
why shulde they els, be cast oute
of the company, or communion,
of al christen men. In token that
they haue no parte i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the gospel,
nor of the kingdome of Christe,
except they amende? Saynet
Paule, when he went so earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aboute, to dryue the christen
people amongest the Corynthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aus,
from the vsyng of the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie,
&amp; other vices of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyles
there: what ment he when
he sayde .i. Cor. x. I woulde not
haue you ygnoraunte brethren
that our fathers wer al of them
<pb facs="tcp:5152:13"/>
vnder the cloude, &amp; as passed tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>row
the sea, &amp; al of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wer bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisid
into Moses, in the cloud, &amp;
in the sea, &amp; al did eate one, &amp; the
same spiritual meate, and al did
drynke one spirituall drinke. &amp;c.
What shuld the Apostle meane,
by all these wordes I say? but
that suche of those fathers, as
were afterwardes noughty fell
from God, vnto lust, and synne,
and tempted and prouoked god,
vnto wrathe and vengeaunce in
the wyldernesse, were neuer the
better in the sighte of him, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
they had before sene and felt, so
many of his greate miracles, or
wonderfull dedes, nor for that
they had ben partakers, of so
many, of his holy signes and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes.
Now that this was
S. Paules meanynge, aperyth
playnly, by that he sayth by and
by after the afore aleaged wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des:
<pb facs="tcp:5152:13"/>
out in manye of them, God
had no pleasure. And that same
the Apostle proueth, by that the
Lorde did after ward, punishe &amp;
plage the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so greuously &amp; ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in
the wildernesse. For they were
ouerthrowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the wildernesse,
saythe S. Paule .i. Cor. x. And
then he goeth fourthe there, to
his purpose and sayth: but these
are examples vnto vs: that we
should not luste after euel thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
as they lusted: nor be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers
of Images, as some of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (he meaneth the forefathers
of the Iewes, that prouoked
God in the wyldernesse) were:
And so fourth, as ye may reade
there, at your leasure. And at the
the laste, Sainct Paule conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
thus: al these thinges hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
vnto them, for figures (or
examples, as he mighte saye) &amp;
were wrytten for our warning,
<pb facs="tcp:5152:14"/>
vpon whome the endes of the
worlde are come vpon. Euen as
thoughe he would saye. It shall
nothyng auayle you, O ye chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
amongest the Corinthians,
that ye once receaued the spirite
of God, at your baptysme, that
ye come ofte to praye togyther,
and synge psalmes in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bles, nor that ye do ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
receaue the sacrament of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
bodye and bloude &amp;c. As o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good christen do: Excepte
that ye do followe youre profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in dede, continew in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryt
and feare of the lorde, auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge
all deadly synne, and the
wicked wourshypping of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
that is vsed, amongest your
neighbours and familiers the
gentyles there, at Corrinth. &amp;c.
And by thys good mother is it
easy, to applye this aforesayde
saying of sainet Paule: vnto our
<pb facs="tcp:5152:14"/>
corrupte ryme (of whyche no
doubte, the holy goste shewed
before hande .ii. Timo. iii.) And
to esteme those persons, no trew
chrystians, whiche do perseuer
wythoute all repentaunce and a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mendement,
in all maner of vice,
and abominacions, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world.
For Saynt Iames saythe that
the pure and vndefiled religion,
before god, and the father, is, to
vysit the fatherlesse and wyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
in theyr afflyccion (by
these two good workes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
he vnderstandeth the walki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g,
in all other good dedes, ye may
bee sure) and to kepe hym selfe,
vnspotted of the world. That is:
to beware, that he defile not hys
soule, nor body nother, with the
couetousnes, extorsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, adultery,
fornicacion, Idolatrye, or suche
lyke abomynacions, whyche the
worlde commonlye vsyth or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytteth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5152:15"/>
But to returne somwhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne,
vnto my purpose: please
it you to vnderstande good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that whereas ye shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
fynde, certaine annotacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
in the mergent, of this treatyse,
the same I made my selfe, with
out master Hopers knowledge:
(but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithful, may sone iudge,
whyther they be trewe or no) if
they wyl confer the same, wyth
the righte touche stone, the holy
scryptures. This I wright for
none other intent, but that, if the
same annotacions do not lyke
you, ye should not put y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blame in
mayster Hoper, who knoweth
not yet of them. And as for the
notes that I haue made here &amp;
there concernynge the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I amsure that ye woulde
nor be offended wyth them, yf
ye had rede the same doctors
<pb facs="tcp:5152:15"/>
mynde, in other places of hys
woorkes: Because y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same,
he dothe manyfestlye declare,
that he was of the ryghte opy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyon
in the sayde Sacramente.
For in hys fyrste boke agaynste
the herityke Marcion, who
dyd saye that all the thinges of
thys world wer vncleaue (but
other more dampnable heresies
then that dyd he stiffely defend)
he sayth these wordes folowi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g:<note place="margin">Tertuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aus mi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes body &amp; bludde</note>
Chryst dyd not reproue breade,
by whyche he dyd represent his
bodye. And in hys fourthe boke
where he confuteth the sayde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
herityke, for saying
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our sauioure Iesus, had but a
pha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tastical body: he is yet more
playne, and sayth thus: Chrsyte
toke breade, distributed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same
vnto hys discyples, and made
it his bodye, sayinge: this is my
bodye. That is to say, a figure
<pb facs="tcp:5152:16"/>
of my bodye. But that had ben
no figure thereof, except that he
had had a verye bodye. For a
vaine thing, which is but a pha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasy,
can receaue no figure. Or
els yf he dyd therefore make
breade hys bodye, because that
he lacked a trewe bodye: Then
should he haue deliuered bread,
for vs. And that had made for
the vanytye of Marcyon, that
breade had be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> crucyfied. Hether
to are Tertulians wordes: by
the whych ye may playnely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue,
that he beleued not (as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Papystes do) that the breade of
the Sacrament, was the verye
body of Chryste Really, no, but
figuratiuely, or i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a mistery. And
for the better vnderstanding of
the whole treatyse folowynge
(because that mayster Iohn Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
did it not) I haue translated
the prologe into the same, here
<pb facs="tcp:5152:16"/>
my selfe symplye, and as wel as

For yf he had meant of such,

is constrayned to leaue his
<pb facs="tcp:5152:24"/>

the other is souffered to conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue

be defiled, by mariyng, one that
is not of the housholde of fayth,
maye not the one be sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

What communicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is there of
god? What inuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ?
there is no nourishment of faith,
but rather mencion, howe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroye

consolacion of the spryte? Where
is the holy praisynge of god? All
thynges be turned of a nother

and all thynges damned

thoughe they happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to suche to,
as were called to the faythe, in

matrimony, yet they are excused,
as personnes called to the fayth,

<pb facs="tcp:5152:30"/>
and therfore be they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded,
to contynue, and the

lykewyse there is hope of wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge

suche a matrimonye, be alowed
of god: Why hathe it no better
successe? Why is it not defended
from affliction, from oppression,

that happeneth to marye a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
whiche hathe after their

vertewe, so that it semeth, that
god hathe vouchsaued to cal her
to suche a state, of suche a man:
I saye, the gentyles are aferde
to speke so sone yuel of, as of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in so muche, that she is lesse

knoweth or perceaueth that her
housbande waxeth better, and
begynneth to feare God, so that
suche men be the soner wonne,
whiche by the grace of God do
happen vpon suche a make. For a
conclusion, it is an other matter,
to fall in to thynges forbydden
(which displease god) willingly,
and of purpose, sythe that euen
as they offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de god, so bring they
them selues, into moche incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenyence.
This is once as mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
as the sunne, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> none but wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
dothe fayne, as thoughe
they fauered the christian fayth.
Yea, and god shall fynde oute
those weme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wel ynoughe, which
do not abhorre suche wowers,
and all because they myghte be
in the more estimacion, so that
they take them to their housba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
aud thereby seclude the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
<pb facs="tcp:5152:31"/>
from the christian faythe.
Here haue I rehersed wherfore
suche matrimonye can take no
good successe: Because it began
of yuel, and is condempned, of
the lorde. But yet let vs se fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whether this matrymonye
be lawful, that declareth vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relye
to be despisers of goddes
word. Hathe not all prudente, &amp;
wyse lordes or maisters, alway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
forbydden theyr seruauntes,
to mary with straungers, leste
they should fal in to wantonnes,
omyt theyr dewties, and geue
awaye theyr masters goodes, to
straungers. More ouer there
was a lawe amongest the genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
that yf any fre ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, had kept
an other mannes seruaunt, after
that he was admonyshed, he
shoulde therby haue loste his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
and become a seruaunte.
And shall worldelye ordinances
<pb facs="tcp:5152:32"/>
be preferred before the heuenlye
decrees, and lawes of god? so
that the gentyles shoulde lose
their lybertie, for marying with
a straunger, and oure wemen
shoulde go, and ioyne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selfes,
with seruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of the diuel, and
shal neuer the lesse be accompted
of the housholde of faythe? But
nowe some wyl denye, that euer
god taught the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any suche way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
by his apostle: what haue I
more to saye, to open and vtter

that oure faythe is weake
