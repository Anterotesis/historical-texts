            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

IN Parliament,</head>
            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <head type="sub">Peers to render Judgment on Peers.</head>
               <p>THE Execution of all our Laws
hath been long since distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
by <hi>Parliament</hi> out of
inferiour Courts, in such sort
as the Subjects were directed where to
complain, and the Justice how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
wrongs and punish offences: And
this may be the reason of the Judges
opinion in <hi>Thorps</hi> Case, 31. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.
<hi>Num.</hi> 37.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61820:9"/>
That Actions at Common-Law are
not determined in this High Court of
<hi>Parliament,</hi> yet complaints have ever
been received in <hi>Parliaments</hi> as well of
private wrongs as publick offences. And
according to the quality of the Person,
and nature of the offence, they have
been retained or referred to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law.</p>
               <p>Touching the quality of the Person
the Lords of the <hi>Parliament</hi> did not
anciently try any Offenders how great
soever the offence was, unless he were
their Peer. As by that of 4 <hi>E. 3. N.</hi> 2.
where when the King commanded the
Lords to give Judgment on <hi>Simon de
Bereford,</hi> and divers others also, who
were not their Peers, for the murther of
<hi>E.</hi> 2. and the destruction of the Earl of
<hi>Kent,</hi> Son of <hi>E.</hi> the first. A proviso and
agreement was made and recorded in
these words, <hi>Et est assensu &amp; accord,</hi> &amp;c.
And it is assented and accorded by our
Lord the King, and all the Grandees in
full <hi>Parliament.</hi> That albeit the Peers
as Judges of the <hi>Parliament</hi> have took
upon them, and rendred the said Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Peers to render Judgment on Peers.</note>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That yet the said Peers who
now are, or shall be in time to come
be not bound or charged to render Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61820:9"/>
upon others than Peers. Nor that
the Peers of the Land have power to
do this, but thereof ever to be discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and acquitted; And that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Judgment rendred be not drawn
to example or consequence in time to
come, whereby the said Peers shall do
contrary to the Laws of the Land if the
like Case happen, which God forbid.
4 <hi>E 3. N.</hi> 6. This Proviso and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was made by the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and it had these respects. First
to satisfy the Commons, that the Lords
by these Judgments intended not to alter
the course of the Common-Law, and
therefore they disclaimed that they had
power to do this,<note place="margin">Quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law of the Land.</note> and confess it was
contrary to the Law of the Land.</p>
               <p>Secondly to preserve their own Right,
to Judge none but the Peers, in Case of
Life and Death. For then the Kings
Steward is to sit in the Chancellors
place and the Lords are to be Tryers
and Judges: And so by judging others
then their Peers descended below their
degrees, For none but Peers are so to
be Tryed and Judged. It is otherwise
in Cases of misdemenors, then the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
keeps his Place, and the Lords
are only Judges and not Tryers, they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61820:10"/>
may command a Jury to be Impan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelled.</p>
               <p>For Tryal of the Facts, if the truth
appear not by the Parties answer, the
Testimonies are Exhibited as 1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. in
the Case of <hi>Alice Peirce.</hi> Here ariseth
a Question.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Whether the Spiritual Lords de Jure,<note place="margin">How Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops are tryable.</note> are
tryable by their Peers or no?</head>
                  <p>Out of <hi>Parliament</hi> they are not to be
Tryed by the Peers; But the doubt is,
whether in time of <hi>Parliament</hi> they are
to be so Tryed or no? To me it seems
they may, if the matter be moved
against them in time of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
For as it is in the <hi>Parliament</hi> at <hi>York,</hi>
15 <hi>E.</hi> 2. in the Act for the Repeal of the
<hi>Spencers</hi> banishment, they are Peers in
<hi>Parliament.</hi> Note, that the Petition for
the Repeal saith that the Bishops are
Peers in <hi>Parliament.</hi> The Bishops name
themselves Peers of the Land: And the
Chancellor to the King. And the Act
stile them Peers of the Land in <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There be divers Presidents also of the
Tryal of Bishops by their Peers in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
as well for Capital offences as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61820:10"/>
misdemenors, whereof they have been
accused in <hi>Parliament.</hi> As the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Canterbury, 15 E. 3. N. 6, 7, 8.
Et ibid. postea,</hi> 44 &amp; 39. <hi>Et ibid. 17 E.</hi> 3.
22. And the Bishop of <hi>Norwich. 7. R.</hi> 2.
for misdemeanors: So were the Bishops
of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Chichester,</hi> Tryed for Treason
by their Peers in <hi>Parliament,</hi> upon the
Appeal of the Lords Appellants, 11
<hi>R.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno 21 R.</hi> 2. The Commons accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> of
Treason, and the temporal Lords judged
him a Traytor, and banished him: But
if the Bishop be accused out of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
he is to be tryed by an Ordinary
Jury of Free-holders; for his honour is
not inheritable, as is the temporal Peers
out of <hi>Parliament,</hi> save that only of
their Tryal. As no day of Grace to be
granted against them in any Suit. A
Knight to be returned upon the Pannel
where a Bishop is party, and no Process
in a civil action to be awarded against
his body, and the like. And by this
it appeareth what Persons are <hi>de Jure,</hi>
tryable by the Lords in <hi>Parliament,</hi> viz.
their Peers only.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61820:11"/>
                  <head>Touching the nature of the Offence.<note place="margin">The nature of the offence.</note>
                  </head>
                  <p>Herein the complaint and accusation
as well of the Party delinquent as offence
is to be considered. For upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the King at his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or upon complaint of private
Persons, the Lords may not by the Law
try any but their Peers for Capital of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.
And the Lords have ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
offences of other nature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of by private Persons to the
Common-Law, if there be remedy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
some special cause appear fit for their
own Judgment.</p>
                  <p>But upon complaints and accusations
of the Commons, the Lords may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in Judgment against the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of what degree soever, and what
nature soever the offence be. For where
the Commons complain, the Lords do not
assume to themselves tryal at Common-Law.
Neither do the Lords at the tryal
of a Common Impeachment by the
Commons, <hi>decedere de jure suo:</hi> For
the Commons are then in stead of a
Jury, and the Parties answer, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of witnesses, are to be in
their Presence, or they to have Copies
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61820:11"/>
thereof: And the Judgment is not to be
given but upon their demand, which is
in stead of a verdict, so the Lords do
only judg not try the Delinquent. In
the Lords proceedings in Judicature is
observed also a certain form, which
varieth according to the nature of the
complaint, and the matter complained
of; so that no general Rules can be
given therein, though many Judgments
have been reversed for errors, whereof
there be many Precedents. And the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
upon life and death, hath been
stayed at the Request of the Commons,
the proceedings being illegal, whereof
I have seen only one Precedent, touching
the Duke of <hi>Clarence, tempore E.</hi> 4.
Wherefore for our better understanding
of the Form of Judicature, let us first
consider the several causes wherein Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature
belongs to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and
then the ancient way of proceedings in
each Cause.</p>

many others may be abandoned from

upon between the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
as the manner then was; The

Schedule of their demands to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
before Treaty should proceed.
Amongst which one was, That all such
who without Cause have lost or given
up any Castle, Town, or Fortress, to the

the People, may be put to their Answer

                     <p>The Complaint herein is general,
They accuse such as had delivered up
Castles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if it be an Accusation:
But they name not the Parties, yet two

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61820:16"/>
The Commons grant a Subsidy, according

That it is not their meaning to grant the

The <hi>Commons</hi> having granted the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidy,
they protested their good will, and
firm purpose, to aid the King; and said,
That it seemed to them for truth, that if
the King had always about him Loyal
Subjects, good Councellors, and faithful
Officers, he had been rich in Treasure,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61820:17"/>
and needed not have charged his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>

desired that three things might be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

of some Privy Councellors about

                     <p>2. Secondly, of Loans to the King by

First, <hi>Richard Lyons,</hi> Merchant of
<hi>London,</hi> is impeached and accused by
the Commons of many Deceits, Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and many other ill deeds by him
done to our Lord the King, and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as well during the time he was retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the King's House, and to the King's
Council, as otherwise, whilst he was
Farmer of the Subsidy and Customs of
the King. And in special of this, that
the said <hi>Richard,</hi> by Covyn made between
him, and some of the Privy-Council of
our Lord the King, for their private Profit
and Advantage, hath procured many
Patents, and Writs of License, to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
great quantities of Wools, and
Wool-fells, and other Merchandize be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Seas, to other places than the
Staple at <hi>Callis,</hi> contrary to the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so they declare of many
other Villanies in great deceipt of the
King, and of his Court. Whereunto
the said <hi>Richard</hi> being then present in
Parliament, said, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then follows his Answer in particular
to what was particularly alledged against
him, and in general to what was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
charged upon him.</p>
                     <p>The Lords reassured him for that
which was particularly objected against
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61820:18"/>
him, and granted Commissions to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of the Extortions wherewith he
was charged in general.</p>
                     <p>Then the Commissioners in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
accused and impeached <hi>William</hi> Lord
<hi>Latimer</hi> of divers Extortions, Grievances,
Deceits, and ill Deeds, <hi>viz.</hi> of divers
Oppressions, when he served the King in
<hi>Britain,</hi> for being Partner with <hi>Richard
Lyons, &amp;c.</hi> and for loss of Towns and
Forts beyond the Seas. <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item, William Ellis</hi> of <hi>Great Tarmouth</hi>
was impeached in this present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in divers manners.</p>
                     <p>First, by Surmise of the Commons,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Numb. 11.</p>
                     <p>And afterwards <hi>John Botheil,</hi> and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Cooper,</hi> exhibited their two Bills in
form which followeth:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To their thrice redoubted Lord the King,
and to the said Council shewn,</hi> &amp;c. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of the Oppressions of the said
<hi>William Ellis,</hi> unto them, and others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and their Oath was taken against him.
<hi>Numb.</hi> 32.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item, John Peecher</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
was accused and impeached by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61820:18"/>
the said Commons, That he, by the
assent and aid of <hi>Richard Lyons,</hi> and of
other Privy Councellors, for their private
profit and advantage, have purchased a
Patent under the Great Seal of our Lord
the King, containing that none shall sell
sweet Wines within the Francheses of
the City of <hi>London,</hi> but only the said
<hi>John.</hi> Numb. 38.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item, John Nevill</hi> was likewise im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> for buying the King's
Debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for loss of Towns beyond
the Seas.</p>
                     <p>Here I observe, that though the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
complained,<note place="margin">Observe.</note> 50 <hi>E.</hi> 3. but of three
Grievances, <hi>viz.</hi> of the withdrawing the
Staple from <hi>Callis;</hi> of Loans to the King
upon excessive Usury; and of buying
the King's Debts; yet when they who
were accused appeared, they declared
against them for other matters also: As
against <hi>Lyons,</hi> for new Impositions upon
Wools, without assent in Parliament;
and against the Lord <hi>Latimer,</hi> for his
misgovernment beyond the Seas, and loss
of Forts there; and against <hi>Peecher,</hi> for
a Monopoly of sweet Wines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I observe also,<note place="margin">Observe.</note> that their Declaration
is not made according to the strict forms
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61820:19"/>
of Law, as you may perceive by that
against <hi>Lyons,</hi> wherein so many Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are so generally set down against
him, that he made no answer to them,
neither could, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Lords notwithstanding did not
reject, but supplied the defects thereof,
by granting Commissions to enquire
thereof. <hi>Ibid. Numb. 20. in fine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> In this Parliament of 50 <hi>E.</hi> 3.
an Ordinance was made against Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's
pursuing businesses in the King's
Court, and especially against <hi>Alice Peirce,
Numb.</hi> 45. I find no Accusation against
<hi>Alice Peirce;</hi> I only conjecture that the
Commons complained of her, though it
be not entred, for she is in the number of
them whom in the next Parliament of
50 <hi>E. 3. Numb.</hi> 87. the Speaker of the
Commons names to be unjustly convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in this Parliament: And none were
there convicted, but those whom the
Commons complained of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item, Adam de Bury,</hi> Citizen of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
was impeached by the Clamor of
the Commons in this Parliament of
many Deceits, and other ill things done
to the King, and to his People, whilest
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61820:19"/>
he was Mayor of <hi>Callis,</hi> and Captain of
<hi>Bullingam,</hi> and other ways, as more at
large appears in one great Bill, delivered
in Parliament the last day of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at <hi>Eltham.</hi> And thereupon the
said <hi>Adam</hi> was sent for to come to answer
in Parliament, and he came not, neither
could be found. Wherefore it was
awarded, that all his Goods and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
should be put in Arrest; and so it
was done by Writs sent to the Sheriffs of
<hi>London</hi> and <hi>Kent:</hi> And the said Bill is on
File with the special Petitions of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
50 <hi>E. 3. Numb.</hi> 11.</p>
                     <p>Out of this last Precedent, concerning
<hi>Adam de Bury,</hi> I observe two things:</p>
                     <p>1. First, whom they complained of:
The Lords sent for him only to appear
before them; they sent not to apprehend
him as a Delinquent, until he contemn'd
their Demand, whereof more hereafter
in the Title of the Parties Answer.</p>
                     <p>2. Secondly, that the Commons deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
not their Impeachment (that is,
their Declaration) against the Party
accused, until he appeared before the
Lords, and then they kept it untill the
last day of the Parliament, in hope that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61820:20"/>
he would be brought before the Lords;
and when they saw he could not be
found, they then delivered their Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against him, to the end (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve)
the particulars of their Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
might remain upon Record against
them hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Here I also observe an Error of the
Clerk, that he hath omitted the Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
against <hi>Alice Peirce, John de Leyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
and <hi>Walter Spooner,</hi> who were all
convicted in this Parliament, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by the Speaker's motion to the King
for their Pardons in the next Parliament.
50 <hi>E. 3. Numb.</hi> 87.</p>
                     <p>Thus much touching the Commons
Accusations and Impeachments.</p>
                     <p>The next Precedent is in 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. in
which Parliament the whole Commons
with one assent assembled, came before
the King, Prelates, and Lords, in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
Chamber, complaining grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously
of <hi>Michael de la Poole,</hi> Earl of
<hi>Suffolk,</hi> Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> there
present, accusing him openly by word
of Mouth:</p>
                     <p>1. First, that whereas he being Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,
was bound by Oath to further the
King's Profit and Commodity in all
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61820:20"/>
things: He notwithstanding contrary to
the said Oath, and not regarding the
King's great necessity, had purchased of
the King Lands and Tenements to a great
value, procuring the same, by reason
of his Office, to be Surveyed at an under
value.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Item,</hi> Whereas at the last Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nine Lords were appointed to see
and examin the State of the King and
Realm; which being done, and their
Advice delivered to the King, as well by
word as writing, by what means the
same might best be remedied: The
Chancellor promised in open Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that the same should be put in
Execution, which was not done, through
his default, he being a Principal Officer.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Item,</hi> Whereas the Subsidy, granted
the last Parliament, was appointed by
the assent of the King and Lords, in what
sort it should be expended, and not other
ways employed; in this was his default,
he being Principal Officer.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>Item,</hi> Whereas <hi>John Tidman</hi> had a
certain Annuity from <hi>E.</hi> 3. which he had
since forfeited, and the payment thereof
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61820:21"/>
was discontinued for the space of 20 or
30 years: The said Chancellor knowing
this, purchased his Interest, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the King to confirm the same unto
him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. <hi>Item,</hi> That whereas the great Master
of St. <hi>Antony</hi> being a Schismatic, had
thereby forfeited to the King all his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
within this Realm, the same Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
had taken the same to Farm of the
King for 20 Marks. And whereas the
Master should have livery thereof again,
he could in no wise get the same, until he
had bound himself to pay 100 <hi>l.</hi> yearly
to the Chancellor and his Son.</p>
                     <p>6. <hi>Item,</hi> That during the time of his
Chancellorship, there had passed divers
Charters of Pardon, as well for Murders,
Treasons, and Felonies, as also for rasing
of Rolls, and imbezelling of Laws and
Records; and especially since the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this Parliament, a Charter of
<hi>Franchises</hi> was granted to the Castle of
<hi>Dover,</hi> to the disinheritance of the
Crown, and to the Subversion of all the
Places and Courts of the King, and his
Laws.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:61820:21"/>
7. <hi>Item,</hi> That at the last Parliament
divers Sums were allotted for the defence
of the Town of <hi>Gant,</hi> notwithstanding
the same Money was lost, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by his
default, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of all which Articles, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
demand Judgment of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have been long upon this, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all the Precedents follow at large.
These are the most formally set down of
all the Accusations hitherto of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
yet most of these are very general
and uncertain: Howbeit the Chancellor
took no exceptions to the insufficiency
thereof, but answered to every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
                     <p>The next Accusation of the Commons
is 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. in the 21. of the King, they
accused divers of those whom the Lords
had first appealed; whereof, when we
speak of all Appeals. <hi>Anno 21 R.</hi> 2. the
Commons accused and impeached of
Treason the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,
Numb.</hi> 15. and demanded Judgment
against him, and had it. <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.</p>

for that many reported him to be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true

of his Loyalty, wherein he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that his Father, and three of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
died in the Service of the King,
and of his Father and Grandfather. That
he himself had served 34 years in the
Wars, being then but a Knight. That
he had been taken Prisoner, and paid

20000 Marks for his Ransom. That he
had been 30 years of the Order of the

and had been 17 years in the King's

he prayed God so to pardon him, as he

                     <p>Whether this was sent to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,

the Commons required the Duke might

confessed,<note place="margin">General Fame.</note> That the general Fame

objected against him. <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.</p>
                     <p>On the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> the Speaker
declared to the Lords, how the Duke of

to the <hi>French,</hi> who prepared to come
hither. And that the said Duke, for his

On the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,

by the King to the Commons, (a thing
not usual) but wherefore they were sent
is not expressed, happily to be informed
what they could say against the Duke, or
to reconcile the business. But the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
delivered to this Chancellor, and
those other Lords, a Bill of Articles
against the Duke, wherein they accused
him of divers Treasons, <hi>viz.</hi> For inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to marry his Son to the Heir of the
Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi> and thereby for want
of Issue of the King, to claim the Crown.

another Bill of less Offences against him,

                     <p>Then followeth the Judgment against
<hi>John Matrevers, Thomas de Gurney,</hi> and

accusations are recorded against
any of them, unless they were comprised
in those general words of that against
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61820:26"/>
                        <hi>Mortimer,</hi> viz. And other of his Coyn.
For some of the same Crimes are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the Judgments, yet no doubt
but the Kings Attourny did exhibit Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
against every of them, upon which
the Lords proceeded to Judgment. Here
I do ingenuously confess my own Error,
when I said that this Judgment against
<hi>Roger de Mortimer</hi> was afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed;
for that he was put to death
without any Accusation, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to be so upon first view of the
Repeal thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anno 21. E. 3. Numb.</hi> 10. Where the
Petitioners <hi>Roger de Mortimer,</hi> the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child
assigneth for that the said Earl was
put to death, and he disinhereted: <hi>Sans
Accusament, Et sans estre masone in
Judgment ou en Respons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By which words <hi>(sans accusament)</hi> I
gave you to understand that the Articles
were no accusation, whereas now upon
better Consideration I do find that these
words do intend no accusation by wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
or otherwise to prove the said
Articles objected against him. For these
Articles are a legal accusation in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and frequently used, as appears
by many Precedents of the like nature.
But there was no other proof offered
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61820:27"/>
by the Lords to prove the same, then
that the King believeth them, and that
they are notorious and known for truth
unto the Lords, and all the People of the
Realm.</p>
                     <p>And the Lords also having examined
these Articles, said all these things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
therein are notorious and known.
They speak not a word of any one wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
examined, or any other proof then
the common fame: For this Cause and
for that the said Earl was not brought
to Judgment nor to answer, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
unseen and unheard upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Fame only without any legal Proof,
The whole Parliament did very justly
Repeal the said Judgment and Record,<note place="margin">The Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in all points.</note>
declaring it to be erronious and defective
in all points. And the Lords were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to damn the whole Record in all
points, least haply it might be alledged
against themselves another time for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anno 15. E.</hi> 2. The Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
joyned in the Accusations against
the <hi>Spencers,</hi> and for that the Lords had
no Record in their own pursuit upon the
Cause contained in their award, and they
ought not to be their own Judges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
having been Accusors no exceptions were
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61820:27"/>
taken to the Articles but other Errors
assigned, <hi>quod vide</hi> where it is said to be
<hi>sans Accusament,</hi> so that they repealed it
not for that there was no Accusation
but for that he was not brought to his
Answer.</p>
                     <p>Again, That those words <hi>Sans accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
should simply signify no Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is only the Averment of the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Judgment doth not say, that
there was no accusation, but that it was
erronious in all points. And so it was,
no proof being produced but common
Fame to prove the Answer. And this
first error bred a second. I do not well
understand the meaning of these words
<hi>(Sans accusament.)</hi> That a Peer ought to
be Indicted for Capital offences in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
But having perused all the
Judgments I do not find any one Peer
indicted in Parliament. In 11. <hi>R.</hi> 2.
<hi>Numb.</hi> 7. All the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal claimed as their liberty and
franchise, that the great matters mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this Parliament, and to be moved
in other Parliaments in time to come
touching the Peers of the Land, ought
to be admeasured adjudged and discussed
by the course of the Parliament, and
not by the Civil-Law, nor by the Law
<pb facs="tcp:61820:28"/>
of the Land, used in the more base
Courts of the Realm, which the King
granted in full Parliament, <hi>eodem Anno
Rot. Appeal</hi> 290.</p>
                     <p>This is said to be their ancient custom,
<hi>viz.</hi> To be adjudged according to the
use of the Parliament only.</p>
                     <p>Then no Peer can be indicted in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
for that it is contrary to the
use of Parliament. Let this suffice for
the confession and rectifying mine own
former Error herein.</p>
                     <p>But a Lord of Parliament may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
out of Parliament, and by the
Kings command proceeded against in the

was brought into Parliament under the

In the Process against him is recorded

that for suspition of Treason surmised
against him, he was arrested in the
Marches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by <hi>Monsieur de Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi>
and other Lords Temporal there
being in the said Marches, and that he
was brought under the said Arrest by
commandment of the Lords to Answer
in this Parliament, to that which shall
be surmised against him, in special con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
certain Letters, which were
found and sent to the King and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel.
The Letters were also recorded,
and read in Parliament, <hi>Numb.</hi> 17. 18,

of opinion that the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi>
might send Sir <hi>Ra. Ferrers</hi> to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,

might examine the Treason whereof he
was suspected, though they could not

the Commons, he being a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner,

out in the Examination of this business,
they found the Letters to be counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited,

And so far their proceeding was not ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.
For the Parliament may entertain

Thus much touching the Charge against
the said Earl by Information in the Kings
behalf.</p>
                  <p>A Question was demanded of me and
others in private,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> the last Parliament:
Thar seeing by Order of the Lords House
<hi>May</hi> 4. the Earl of <hi>Bristols</hi> cause should
be wholly retained in this House, how
that might now be done in respect of
the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. By which it was
enacted, That all Treasons committed
beyond the Seas, as this Earls were, shall
be tryed in the Kings Bench, or before
Commissioners Assigned by the King;
And an Order of the upper House can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61820:34"/>
avoid the <hi>Statute.</hi> Some were of
opinion, that the Earl was first to be
indicted before Commissioners, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the King, and that Indictment
being returned into the Parliament to be
tryed thereon by his Peers, and vouched
that Precedent of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 6. Of Sir <hi>John
Mortimers</hi> Indictment returned into the
Parliament.</p>
                  <p>But then the Cause cannot be wholly
retained in the Parliament, neither can
it be inferred out of the Precedent of
Sir <hi>John Mortimer,</hi> that the Parliament
can try any of Treason unless he be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
elsewhere. For then the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
should not have so much power,
as hath the Kings Bench and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Courts, wherein Capital Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
may be both enquired of and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.
Neither can Sir <hi>John Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timers.</hi>
Indictment thus returned be a
leading Case, for Tryal of Peers in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
for he was but a Commoner,
and therefore not to have been judged
by the Lords, unless they had first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
him, and the Commons did so by
Informing the Indictment to be true,
before the Lords gave Judgment upon
him. But their can be no Precedent
shewn, that a Peer of Parliament hath
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61820:35"/>
been tryed in Parliament on an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
taken elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>To resolve this Question two things
are Considerable.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Resolve. 1.</note> The <hi>Statute</hi> of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the meaning thereof were to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Tryal of a Peer in the time of
the Parliament (for Forreign Treasons
assigned) taken in the Kings Bench, or
before Commissioners Assigned by the
King, and not elsewhere. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the <hi>Statute</hi> hath no such meaning.
The Preamble saith, it was doubted
whether such Treasons might by the
Common-Law of the Land be enquired
into, heard, and determined within this
Realm of <hi>England.</hi> For a plain remedy
Order, and Declaration herein to be had
and made, Be it enacted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that
if such Treasons have not been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
enquirable by the Common-Law,
then this <hi>Statute</hi> provides a Remedy and
Order for the same hereafter. But this
<hi>Statute</hi> doth not abridg the Parliament
of the power it had to enquire of, and
determine such Treasons in time of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
Whereof there are diverse
Precedents, <hi>viz. 1 R. 2. Weston</hi> and
<hi>Gomeniz, 50 E.</hi> 3. for <hi>William Latimer,</hi>
and <hi>John Nevil, 7 R.</hi> 2. for the Bishop
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61820:35"/>
of <hi>Norwich, &amp; ibid. Numb.</hi> 17. for
<hi>Cressingham</hi> and <hi>Shipworth, &amp; ibid. Numb.</hi>
24. for Sir <hi>William Elsingham,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas
Trevet,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry de Ferrers,</hi> all
Tryed in Parliament for matters done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Seas.</p>
                  <p>The second thing to be considered is,
The Order it self which I conceive to be
of force notwithstanding the <hi>Statute,</hi>
of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. for that it is neither directly
contrary to the <hi>Statute,</hi> nor repugnant to
the Common-Law, otherwise the Act
of one House alone cannot alter a former
<hi>Statute</hi> made by consent of both Houses.
And this is to be remembred,<note place="margin">Observ.</note> that the
Proceeding against a Peer in Parliament
is not necessary.</p>
                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>But thus it was used to be, viz.</head>
                     <p>The Peer accused to be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lords and Commons, and then
the Lord Steward to sit in the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
place, on the <hi>Woolsack</hi> and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
to be read against him by the
Clark of the Crown, and upon his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the Lords do determine of their
Judgment, which is afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
by the same Lord Steward.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61820:36"/>
A Question might be whether the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
have used to sit with their Speaker
at these Tryals. If they have then the
Court of Requests, or some such place
may be provided for the purpose. And
thus that whole Cause might be retained
in Parliament notwithstanding the <hi>Stat.</hi>
of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Thus much touching the
Accusation, <hi>ex parte Dom. Regis,</hi> exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited

The Accusation and manner was
thus. The said Earl had raised Forces
to have joyned with his Son <hi>Hotspur,</hi>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:61820:36"/>
in Rebellion against the King: <hi>Hotspur</hi>
was slain in the Battel of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi>
21 <hi>July 4. H.</hi> 4. before the said Earl
could joyn with him. Whereupon he
dismissed his Forces, and retired to
<hi>Worksworth</hi> Castle. The King after the
Battel came to <hi>York,</hi> and sent for the

of his Covyn.</p>
                     <p>In which Articles are named the
Arch-Bishop of <hi>York: Tho. Newberry</hi>
Earl Marshal, the said Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi>
the said Lord <hi>Bardolph</hi> and many
others, and their several Treasons are
therein contained. The Lords having
advised therein, and considered the
proofs delivered their opinion to the
King touching the said Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi>
and the said Lord <hi>Bardolph</hi> only,
and proceeded to Judgment against
them. Then the King caused to be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61820:38"/>
demanded of the Lords Temporal, Peers
of the Realm what they would say
touching the Act of the said late Arch-Bishop
of <hi>York,</hi> and of the said Earl
Marshal, who lately with a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of people were armed, and train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the field within the Realm of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
with Banners displayed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Unto which demand the said Lords
Temporal said, That according to the
Information to them given by the said
Constable. It seemeth unto them to be
Treason: yet notwithstanding the Lords
desired that with good deliberation,
when they next returned to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they might speak thereof, unto
our Lord the King as no error might be
found in their doings in time to come.
This was done on that day the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was adjorned. Here the Lords
had no other Accusation against those
two Peers but the Kings commandment,
upon view of former Process against
them in the Court of <hi>Chivalry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the Lords declared their opinion
touching the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> and
the Earl Marshal (though their Treasons
were contained in the same Process also)
least Error might be found in their
doings hereafter. But whether they
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61820:38"/>
thought their Error to be, that the King
had not commanded them first to advise
thereon, touching the said Archbishop,
and the Earl Marshal as he had done
touching the others. Let the Reader
Judge; For my part I think that would
have been error: Could the Lords pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
upon Process elsewhere unless the
King commands them?</p>
                     <p>2 <hi>H.</hi> 6. The Judgment against <hi>John
Mortimer,</hi> is drawn up very briefly by
<hi>John Hales</hi> one of the Justices of the
Kings Bench, wherein he first shews
that the said Sir <hi>John Mortimer</hi> was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
in <hi>London</hi> sitting the Parliament
before the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and
other Commissioners appointed by the
King. For that the said Sir <hi>John</hi> being
committed to the Tower, for suspition
of Treason, corrupted his keeper and
broke Prison: That the said Indictment
was returned into Chancery, <hi>Ex man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dato
Dom. Regis,</hi> and by the Chancery
brought into the Parliament before the
Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> the Kings Protector,
and the Lords Temporal, the King being
then an Infant.</p>
                     <p>And the Protector being Authorized
by Commission to hold the Parliament,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61820:39"/>
                        <hi>de Precepto Dom. Regis.</hi> That the said
Sir <hi>John Mortymer</hi> by Vertue of the
Writs was brought before the said
Duke, and Lords, and Commons. That
the said Commons affirmed the said
Indictment to be true, and desired Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against him, as convict of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Felony.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, That he was thereupon
adjudged. In this is set down all the
essential parts of the Lords proceedings
against <hi>Mortymer.</hi> The Ceremonious
or formal parts thereof are omitted, as,
who complained of or accused <hi>Mortymer</hi>
to the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King or the Commons did not,
for then there needed no Indictment:
And therefore it must move for the King
either before the Indictment, or rather
upon the Return thereof unto the House.
For had the Accusation been before the
Indictment, it had been a shorter way
to Arraign him also before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
in <hi>London,</hi> (he being no
Member nor Peer of <hi>Parliament</hi>) then
to return the Indictment into the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi>
and then be brought into the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:61820:39"/>
Here is also omitted the Conference
before hand, between the Lords and
Commons touching this matter: For it
is very unlikely that the Lords did sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
send for the Commons, and then
abruptly read the Information before
them, and they as suddainly affirm the
same, all these are necessarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
That the Commons affirmed the
Indictment, <hi>&amp;e.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It appears that the Lords cannot of
themselves Judge a Common Person,
for an Offence for he is no Peer accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that of, 4 <hi>E. 3. Numb.</hi> 26.</p>
                     <p>The manner of Accusation by Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
<hi>Ex parte Dom. Regis,</hi> is when
the Commons as any other private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
accuse any man unto the Lords in
general, but do not declare the Offences
in particular, other then by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
of the King. Articles are
drawn up against the Delinquent, <hi>Ex
parte Dom. Regis.</hi>

                     <p>2 <hi>R.</hi> 2. The Constable of the <hi>Tower,</hi>
was commanded to bring <hi>Gomeniz</hi> and
<hi>Weston,</hi> (whose Offences were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of in general by the Commons
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61820:40"/>
that they named) before the Lords in
Parliament, to Answer to the Articles
objected against them on the behalf of
the King, and they were severally ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
at the Commandment of the
Lords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eodem anno, Alice Pierce</hi> being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of by the Commons was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused,
and commanded to come before
the Lords in Parliament, to Answer to
certain things objected against her on
the Kings behalf.</p>
                     <p>And here upon Sir <hi>Richard le Scroope,</hi>
Chief Steward of the Kings House by
Comandment of the Lords, rehersed in
Parliment in the presence of the said
<hi>Alice,</hi> a certain Ordinance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Made
in the Parliament of 50 <hi>E.</hi> 3. against
her.</p>
                     <p>And this Rehersal being made, the
said Steward surmised unto the said
<hi>Alice.</hi> That it seemed to the Lords of
the Parliament that she had incurred the
pain comprised in the said Ordinance in
certain points, and especially in two,
That is to say, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By these two Precedents it appears
plain enough that the Lords commanded
the Articles to be drawn, and exhibited
though <hi>ex parte Dom. Regis,</hi> for all these
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61820:40"/>
are said to be done by their Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
And the practise at this day is,
that out of the Complaints of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
as of <hi>Mompesson,</hi> The Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,
and the Lord Tresurer, and a
Committee of the Lords did draw up
the Charges. But they wanted the
words <hi>Ex parte Dom. Regis.</hi>

                  </div>
                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>The reason why in this Cause the Articles
are, Ex parte Dom. Regis, seemed to
be this:</head>
                     <p>The Commons complain but impeach
not, Notwithstanding the Impeachment
the Lords cannot proceed neither can
they Impeach any to themselves:<note place="margin">The Lords cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach any to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</note> So it
rests that the party is to be Impeached
at the Kings Suit.</p>
                     <p>It may be lawful for me to examine
the proceedings of the Lords in the
Complaint against <hi>Mompesson,</hi> and to
compare them with ancient Proceedings
in like Cases, And they will appear to
differ much.</p>
                     <p>And touching <hi>Mompesson</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
did not only complain but accuse
him: He fled, in his absence they ought
to have proceeded to Judgment against
him, before Proclamation first made for
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61820:41"/>
him to appear before the King, and then
at a day, the ancient use in such Cases
was this.</p>
                     <p>The Lords considered of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
and examined the Proofs produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the Commons: Then agreed on
their Judgment and caused Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be made throughout <hi>England</hi> for
the party to appear at a day, else Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
shall be pronounced against him,
with which the Commons are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qnainted
before the Proclamations are
sent for. Then the Return of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
to be reviewed and examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and if any Errors be therein, new
Proclamations are to be made in the next
Shire only for the party to appear at a
short day: If they find no Errors in the
Return, then Judgment is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
and not before. Thus it was
in 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. in <hi>Thomas Mortymors</hi> Case,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> In 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. in the Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlands</hi>
Case. But there needed no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
to be drawn up, <hi>Ex parte Dom.
Regis,</hi> out of the Impeachment of the
Commons for the Suit is theirs and not
the Kings.</p>
                     <p>Touching the Lord Treasurer, First
the Commons did swerve from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Course in this, they delivered not
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61820:41"/>
their Accusation in writing (he being
absent;) Had it been in the open House,
an Impeachment by word of mouth
had been sufficient, and the Suit had
been theirs: but it being at a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,
how could the Lord Treasurer take
notice of their Impeachment? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lords of necessity did draw up
a Charge against him out of their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation,
and then it became the Kings
Suit, and they were abridged of their
power to reply, or demand Judgment,
<hi>Prout in</hi> Weston <hi>&amp;</hi> Gomeniz, <hi>Case</hi> 1.
<hi>R.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Alice Peirce, ibid.</hi> Neither was
it now necessary for the Commons to be
acquainted with the Delinquent's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
or any of the Proceedings, for
that they neither demanded he might be
put to his Answer before the Lords and
them, nor impeached by word in open
House, nor in Writing, One of which
is required in an Impeachment.</p>
                     <p>And the Lords they varied in this,
that they did mingle other Complaints
with these of the Commons, when each
should have been apart of it self, <hi>prout</hi>
43 <hi>E.</hi> 3. Sir <hi>Joh. at Lees</hi> Case. Neither
did the Lords anciently use to omit any
part of the Commons Complaint and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61820:42"/>
Accusation, as they did the Imposition
on the <hi>French-Wines:</hi> And the Articles
of the Charge they sent to the <hi>Lord
Treasurer</hi> ought to have been examined
<hi>ex parte Domini Regis prout</hi> in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Precedents of 1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. The next

this manner of Accusation for publick

of the Heir of <hi>Robert Latymer,</hi> by

the same until Monsieur <hi>John at Lee,</hi> then
Steward of the King's House, sent a

and commanded him, being come,

                  <p>These be the Particulars wherewith
the said <hi>John at Lee</hi> was Charged. It
appeareth <hi>W. Latymer</hi> accused him at the
first, but not the rest; and I imagine
that the Commons accused him of the
Second and other Particulars, for that
they are said somewhat generally, and
are offences against the Liberties of the
Commons; and also for that divers of
the Commons were present at the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
And for the Fourth and Fifth Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
I conceive the King's Councel
accused him thereof, for that one is an
Offence against the legal Proceedings of
Justice, which then was that of the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover,</hi>
viz. <hi>He which accuseth any one of
Felony,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>should remain in Prison as well
as the accused until Trial.</hi> Of later times
the Accuser puts in Sureties to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute;
and the other Offence is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61820:43"/>
wrong done unto the King in his
Revenues: And had any private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
accused him of this, their Petitions
would have been recorded as well as <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymer</hi>'s:
But the Lords proceeded against
him upon <hi>Latimer</hi>'s Accusation, and
then upon the rest severally, and they
did not mingle one with another.</p>

Merchandizes not discharged there, 17
<hi>Nobles</hi> and a <hi>Last</hi> of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and because that
<hi>W. Ellis</hi> knew that <hi>W. Cooper</hi> was to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61820:44"/>
come to the Parliament, and shew these and
other Grievances in aid of the Merchants,
and also to shew how the great Prices of
<hi>Herrings</hi> might be amended in aid of the
whole Realm, the said <hi>W. Ellis,</hi> by false
suggestion, caused the said <hi>W. Cooper</hi> to
be Arrested and put in Prison in the Tower
for three Weeks.</p>
                  <q>May it please you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Here I observe that the Accusation of
a private person ought to be legal and
certain, as that was.</p>
                  <p>This Accusation consists of two parts;
The unjust taking of 17 <hi>Nobles,</hi> &amp;c. from
the Merchant of <hi>Pruse,</hi> and the Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment
of the Petitioner by false sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion
to the King.</p>
                  <p>Upon hearing of the Matter, the Lords
Ordered, That as for the Complaint
tovching the 17 <hi>Nobles,</hi> it should be sent
to the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> to be tried there; but
the Lords themselves determined the
Imprisonment upon the false suggestion
to the King, and awarded <hi>Ellis</hi> to prison,
to pay Fine and Ransom to the King, and
Dammages to the Accusers.</p>
                  <p>The Lords received the latter part of
this Complaint for two Causes; The
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61820:44"/>
one, for the false Suggestion to the King,
limited by the Statute of 31 <hi>E.</hi> 3. to be
punished by the <hi>Chancellor, L. Treasurer,</hi>
and the <hi>Councel</hi> if he be untrue; all which
were present in the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The other, For a Scruple which might
arise out of the Words of the Statute,
which provides for false Suggestions on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the King himself. <hi>Whereas</hi> Ellis <hi>his
false Suggestion was by a Letter written to
one of the Kings Servants, which being
shewed to the King, his Majesty caused the
Petitioner to be imprisoned.</hi> And this
the Lords expounded to be in <hi>Ellis</hi> a
Suggestion unto the King himself. And
had this Point been truly triable at the
<hi>Common Law,</hi> the Lords had referred it
thither: <hi>This is but my own Conceipt.</hi>

                  <p>First, Before the Commons of <hi>England</hi>
in that Assembly, in presence of some
Prelates and Temporal Lords, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
before all the Prelates and
Temporal Lords in full Parliament.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of this Complaint,
he desired the Lords (for God's sake) to
grant sure and speedy protection for
the safety of his Life, and that he
might have sufficient Surety of the
Peace against those of whom he would
complain; and especially he demanded
Surety of Monsieur <hi>Michael de la Poole,</hi>
Chancellor of <hi>England;</hi> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Chancellor did (at the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the King) find Sureties, <hi>viz.</hi>
Two Earls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then the <hi>Fishmonger</hi>
rehearsed, how that all the last Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which was held at <hi>Westminster,</hi> at
<hi>Allhallontide</hi> in the same year, he did
sue by his Bill to have restitution of
certain Merchandizes of great value,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61820:45"/>
(from <hi>Geo. Mansfield</hi> and three others)
which was lost upon the Seas by them
at such time as they had undertaken
the Safeguard of the Seas, and of the
Merchandizes passing and coming in
the mean time, against all Enemies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Royal Power. The which was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorsed,
saith he, and committed to the
Chancery, to discuss and determine the
Matters therein comprized, according
to Law and Reason. Whereupon he
dealt with one <hi>John Otrey,</hi> a Clerk, and
Houshold-Servant to the said <hi>Chancellor,</hi>
for his Master's Favour and Furtherance
in the Business. The Clerk, after he
had viewed a Copy of the Bill, and
considered of the Business, promised,
that for Forty Pounds to his Lord's use,
and Four Pounds to his own use, he
should have speed: That he gave his
Bond for 44 <hi>l.</hi> to be paid at a Day to
come, and afterwards delivcred unto
the said <hi>Otrey</hi> certain <hi>Herrings</hi> and
<hi>Sturgeon,</hi> to the value of 9 or 10 <hi>Marks,</hi>
to the use of the said <hi>Chancellor</hi> in part,
and three yards of <hi>Scarlet,</hi> which cost
him 32 <hi>s.</hi> unto <hi>Otrey,</hi> for his own use,
in part of the said 4 <hi>l.</hi> Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all which, he found no Favour from
the <hi>Chancellor</hi> in his Suit, but was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laied,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61820:46"/>
and still is, and cannot have Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
therefore.</p>
                  <p>That the said <hi>Otrey</hi> told him, that he
could have had more Money of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
to have been against him;
which made him suspect the worst. But,
said he, whether the <hi>Chancellor</hi> shall be
reputed privy to this, God knoweth;
judge you My Lords; for the <hi>Chancellor</hi>
hath paid him for his <hi>Herrings</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fish, and sent him his Bond can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled;
but whether he did it out of
Conscience, or to avoid Slander and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
he knew not; Judge you, My
Lords: but he was not paid for his three
yards of <hi>Scarlet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Unto this the <hi>Chancellor</hi> made his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,<note place="margin">The <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors</hi> Answer.</note>
not presently, but at another time;
for the Record saith, He Answered first
before the Prelates and Lords, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
before the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
whereas the Commons were
present when the Complaint was made,
it being <hi>in pleno Parliamento.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in the Judges Award, to whom
this Matter was afterwards referred, it
is said to be <hi>coram Magnatibus &amp; Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitat'
in Parliamento.</hi> So that the Answer
was made some other way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:61820:46"/>
First, He protested his Innocency
touching the Delay of Justice, and
shewed how the Delay was through
the Difficulty of the Cause, and vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Justices and the Serjeants, who
had often heard the Pleadings.</p>
                  <p>Touching the <hi>Bribery,</hi> he swore by
the Sacrament he had no knowledge
thereof, until upon Accompt with his
Officers, he found those Fishes not paid
for; and then he presently caused them
to be paid for, and the Bond cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and sent him. He denied that his
Clerk moved him in that Business; all
which he offered to prove in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as the King and the Lords should or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
and demanded Justice against the
<hi>Fishmonger</hi> for the Slander. Unto which
the <hi>Fishmonger</hi> presently answered, and
said, He did not accuse the <hi>Chancellor</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but his Clerk only. The Lords
examined the <hi>Fishmonger</hi> and the <hi>Clerk</hi>
about the Bond, and his Adversaries on
their Allegiance, whether they had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
any thing, or promised to give? And
finding tde <hi>Chancellor</hi> free from <hi>Bribery,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted.</note>
the Lords acquitted him of his Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
aforesaid; then at the <hi>Chancellor</hi>'s
Request, the <hi>Fishmonger</hi> was committed
until he found Sureties to appear <hi>de die in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61820:47"/>
diem</hi> before the Lords, and before any
Judges who should be assigned. The
Lords committed the <hi>Clerk</hi> also; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
the Parliament growing to an
end, the Complaint was referred whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Judges to hear and determine
the same, as well for the King, as for
the Parties. <hi>Auxi avant come les Peres de

                     <p>They met at <hi>Westminster June</hi> 19. and
were assisted by the <hi>Lord Treasurer, Lord

he could not have Justice in his Cause

                     <p>It should seem the Lords could find

the <hi>Fishmongers,</hi> and the said Mayor,

                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:61820:48"/>
prayed the King to receive him

<hi>Numb.</hi> 59. which was granted,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 60. Then one <hi>Walter Sybil,</hi> a
<hi>Fishmonger,</hi> craved Audience, and said,
These Bills were not exhibited for any
good zeal to the Commonweal, but for
meer Malice to the <hi>Fishmongers,</hi> for that
the chief Exhibiters of these Bills being
commanded to prison for sundry Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors
in the time of <hi>E.</hi> 3. were then
imprisoned by certain of the <hi>Fishmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi>

                     <p>To that, one <hi>John Moore</hi> a Mercer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
The Citizens of <hi>London</hi> went

they went about to let into the said Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                     <p>The said <hi>Walter Sybill</hi> took advantage

                     <p>
                        <hi>John Moore</hi> thereupon expounded his
words, saying (as the Report then went)
and prayed the Lords that the Truth
thereof might be further enquired of in
the City.</p>
                     <p>There is one only Precedent of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61820:48"/>
made by a private person in the
House of Commons, and of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
proceeding therein, against a Lord
of the Parliament; which was thus:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anno 15. H. 6. Tho. Philips</hi> exhibited
unto the Commons his <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Complaint</hi>
against <hi>John</hi> Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> for his
long Imprisonment upon suspition of
Heresie.</p>
                     <p>The Commons sent up the Bill, being
written in Paper, amongst other, to
the Lords, without any Message, for
ought appeareth upon Record. On <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
following the Bill was read, and
the Lords <hi>Excogitabant,</hi> That it did not
belong to their House <hi>de talibus frivolis

Commons.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon the Commons sent—to
the Bishop for his Answer in writing
unto this Complaint; which yet the
Bishop did forbear to do, until he knew
the Opinion of the Lords herein, and
acquainted their Lordships therewith.
The next day the Lords answered all
with one voyce, <hi>Quod non consentaneum

Lunae 2. Martii.</hi> In the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament

Keeper; but he was not compellable to
answer before the Commons.</p>
                     <p>10 <hi>R.</hi> 2. The Commons accused <hi>de la

King and Lords; unto which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
made a good Answer (in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of this Age) yet upon the many
Replications of the Commons, and the
enforcement of his Oath strictly against
him, he was Fined and Imprisoned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
In this Parliament also the Lords and
Commons procured Commission unto
certain of the Lords to enquire of the
Enormities of the Realm, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
them.</p>
                     <p>The King was so highly displeased
with these Proceedings, that on the last
day of this Parliament, being the <hi>25th.</hi>
of <hi>November,</hi> he himself protested that
nothing done therein should turn to the
Prejudice of him or his Crown. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he sought all means to overthrow
those Lords who procured that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi>
the Earls of <hi>Danby, Arundel, Warwick,</hi>
and Earl <hi>Marshal.</hi> And at a Consultation
thereupon, he sent for the Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<hi>Tressilian,</hi> and some other Judges,
and his Serjeants at Law unto <hi>Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:61820:49"/>
where, on <hi>August 25. Anno</hi> 11. he
propounded certain Questions contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the points of Advantage against
the Proceedings of the last Parliament,
which the Judges affirmed to be Treason
under their Hands and Seals. Then
the King thought to proceed judicially
against those Lords, but they kept to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> at
<hi>Heringby</hi> with a strong Guard: And
the King sent for them, and all doubts
of danger to their Persons, being first
removed,<note place="margin">The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Appeal of 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2.</note> they came <hi>Novemb. 3. Anno</hi>
11. and kneeling before the King's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
he demanded why they were As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
at <hi>Heringby</hi>-Park in warlike
manner? They answered, for the good
of the King and Kingdom, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
certain Traytors from about him,
meaning the Lord of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>York, Michael de la Poole,</hi> Sir

And with that they threw down their
Gloves and Gages of the Challenging to
prove the same. Unto which the King
replied, This shall not be done so; but at
the next Parliament, which shall be the
Morrow after <hi>Candlemas</hi> Day, and then
all parties shall receive according as
they deserve.</p>

                     <p>Where these few Lords Appellants

yet at last he came. <hi>Haec ex Ep. fol.</hi>
603.</p>
                     <p>On the first Day of this Parliament,
the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> (one of the said
Appellants) kneeling before the King,
shewed, That whereas he understood
his Majesty was informed, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the Deposing of him, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
himself to the Crown, he was
ready to declare his Innocency herein,
in such sort as the Lords would ordain.
Whereupon the King answered, He held
him thereof acquitted.</p>
                     <p>On the second Day of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the said Appellants exhibited
their Petition to the King concerning
several Articles against divers Lords and
Commons, whom they appealed of
Treason. The said Articles being read
in presence of the King and Lords in
Parliament, the said Appellants offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to make Proofs thereof, required
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61820:50"/>
that the said Appellees might be called
to Answer; and for default of their
Appearance, demanded Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them. Hereupon the King and
Lords deliberated. The Judges of the
Common Law, and the Sages of the
Civil Law were charged by the King to
give their best Counsel to the Lords of
the Parliament how to proceed in their
Appeal rightly. Who, after long Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation,
answered the Lords, That the
Appeal is in no point made and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
according to the Order of the
Common or Civil Law.</p>
                     <p>The Lords after long Debate, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the Assent of the King, that the
Offences being committed by the Peers,
the Cause should be determined in
Parliament only, and that by the
Law and Order of Parliament only, and
adjudged the said Appeal with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
thereon depending, to be good, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws and Course of
Parliaments.</p>
                     <p>And the Default of Appearance was
Recorded, and Judgment given, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those who made their default.</p>
                     <p>After which Sir <hi>Nicholas Brembre,</hi> a
Commoner, was brought Prisoner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the King and the Lords at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61820:51"/>
of the said Appellants: And the
said Articles being read, he pleaded
<hi>Not Guilty;</hi> which he was ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
with his Body. Whereupon, the
Commons of the Parliament said, that
they had seen and considered all the said
Articles, which they found to be true,
and that they likewise as much as in
them lay, did also accuse the said Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellees,
which they would have done,
and it appertained to them to have done,
had not the aforesaid Appellants pursued
the said Appeals. Whereupon was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
by the Lords of Parliament,
That the Battel doth not lie in this
Case; but that they upon examination
of the Articles, would proceed to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Here I note,<note place="margin">The Lords cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed against a Commoner but upon complaint of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note> That the Lords cannot
proceed against a Commoner, but upon
a Complaint of the Commons: But
here is not expressed how the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
came daily to have a sight of these
Articles. I deny not, but after they
were read in their presence, (for their
presence is always understood in Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature
upon Life and Death <hi>prout postea</hi>)
they demanded a sight of the Articles,
and considered of them apart, and then
supplied the Defects thereof. And this
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61820:51"/>
also is to be observed, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
accuse Commoners, as the Lords
do their own Peers. I suppse that <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre</hi>
was denied the Battel, because the
Commons accused him also; otherwise
he ought to have it granted upon an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal.</p>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61820:52"/>
done by word of mouth, they being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the King upon some other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but now it was done solemnly in
writing, and was delivered to the King
sitting in his Throne of State. There
they offer'd to prove their Accusation by
Battel (a thing not meet for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
or in what course his Majesty
would ordain it; but here the Bill was
read in Parliament, and they said, they
have been, and are ready to prove, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
as you our thrice Redoubted King, and
this Honourable Court of Parliament
should ordain. Nor were they less care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in their proceeding to Judgment, to
avoid the Errors in the former, <hi>prout</hi> in
the Answer. But these Appeals are now
abolished by 1 <hi>H. 4. c.</hi> 14. and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

extraordinary, so were the Proceedings
carried with a strong hand; the former

<hi>prout 21 R.</hi> 2. where the Lords Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants,
and the Commons also accused
<hi>Tho. Mortymer</hi> of Treason; and the
Commons said, That it was notoriously
known unto them, that the King had
sent his Mandate by <hi>W. D.</hi> a Serjeant at
Arms, unto the said <hi>Mortymer</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
commanding him upon his Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to come before the King in all
haste, to answer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that the
said <hi>Mortymer</hi> having notice thereof,
withdrew himself among the wild <hi>Irish,</hi>
where the same Serjeant, nor any other
Officer of the King's durst come, for
fear of Death: Wherefore, and for
that his Offences are notoriously known
both to the Lords and them, they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:61820:54"/>
The King, the Lords, and the Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
of the Clergy considered of the
Request of the Commons with good
deliberation; and then the Lords, with
the said Procurators, by the assent of
the King and Commons, did award that
Proclamation should be made through
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> commanding the
said <hi>Tho. Mortymer</hi> to render himself in
proper Person to the King in what place
soever it shall be in <hi>England,</hi> within three
Months after the <hi>23th.</hi> Day of <hi>December</hi>
next coming, to be at his Answer; and
they farther awarded, That if he came
not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that then he shall be judged
Traytor, and Convict of of all Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
whereof he is accused, and shall
forfeit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the King adjourned the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Appellants to the <hi>15th.</hi>
of <hi>Hilary</hi> next at <hi>Shrewsbury;</hi> on which
Day the said Appellants declared to the
King, That it was awarded that Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
should be made, <hi>&amp;c. ut supra,</hi>
The Commons did the like. And for
that the said <hi>Tho. Mortymer</hi> came not,
they had judgment.</p>
                  <p>In 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. The Lords agreed this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against the E. of <hi>North.</hi> and the
Lord <hi>Bardolph,</hi> who were fled to the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61820:54"/>
Rebels in <hi>Wales,</hi> and Proclamation <hi>ut
supra,</hi> throughout <hi>England.</hi> At the day
prefixed they examined the Returns of
the Proclamations in the presence of the
Commons, and so the Judgment was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on in their presence also; and so
it ought to be in all Cases of Life and
Death. And finding a small Error, they
awarded new Proclamations in <hi>London</hi>
only; and the Return thereof was again
viewed and considered in the presence of
the Commons, and then on the next day
Judgment was given.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eodem Anno 21 R.</hi> 2.<note place="margin">An Answer required, though the Duke was known to be dead.</note> The Lords Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellants
accused also the Duke of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi>
of Treason; and although they
knew he was dead, they prayed the King
that he might be brought to his Answer.
Whereupon the King sent his Writ to
the Council of <hi>Calice</hi> (unto whose Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody
he committed the said Duke) to
bring him into the Parliament to his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
The Captain returned his Writ,
That the Duke is dead; the which Writ
and Return being read, the said Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants
prayed Judgment; and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
shewed, That the Dukes Levying
War against the King's Person, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
known to all the States of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61820:55"/>
and therefore they desired
Judgment also, and had it.</p>
                  <p>And what may not the whole Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
do when they joyn in one? Yet
notwithstanding the King fearing some
Error (as it seems) the Lords Appellants
besought the King, that if there were
any thing on Record, be it by Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or otherwise which concerned their
Appeal, that it might be openly known,
and shewn in full Parliament. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
by the King's Commandment,
was read a Commission granted unto
<hi>William Richal</hi> Justice of the Common-Pleas,
and a Confession of the Duke of
<hi>Gloucester,</hi> made before him, by vertue
of the said Commission; yea and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi>
himself, being commanded, did ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
that the Duke did write the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
with his own hand, in his absence,
and afterwards read it unto him: so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
they were to have something to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
an Answer, I marvel that <hi>Richal</hi>
was acquitted of his Proceedings herein
at the next Parliament of 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. where
he affirmed that much of this Dukes
Confession was altered after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
his Commission. He well deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to die, in that he spake not of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:61820:55"/>
Yet there is one Precedent directly
contrary to all this, <hi>viz. 11 R.</hi> 2. in that
Appeal which happened on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                  <p>The aforenamed Duke of <hi>Gloucester,</hi>
and four other Lords went to the King,
and accused the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the
Archbishop of <hi>York, Michael de la Poole,</hi>
and others of Treason; the King adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to the next Parliament, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them Justice there, and in the mean
time conveyed away the Parties accused,
and then by Proclamation, <hi>Part 8. fol.</hi>
603. in the next Parliament, 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2.
the Articles of the Appeal being read,
the Duke and other Appellants offered to
make proof thereof, and required that
the Parties appealed might be brought to
their Answers; and for default of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
demanded Judgment. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the King did deliberate with the
Lords, and commanded the Justices, and
other Sages of the Law to give their
best Counsel to the Lords how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
rightly in this Matter of Appeal;
who after Consultation therein had, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
the Lords, That they had seen
and considered the Tenor of this Appeal,
which they said was in no point made
and declared according to the Order of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61820:56"/>
the Common or Civil Law. But they
gave no Answer touching the Demand
of Judgment for default of Appearance;
whereupon the Lords deliberated, and
after by the Lords assent declared that
this Cause committed by the Peers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Person of the King and State
of the Realm, shall be determined in
the Parliament only, and by no other
Law than by the Law and Course of the
Parliament: And that it belongs to the
Lords only to judge in such Cases. And
with the assent of the King they did
judge the same Appeal, and the Process
thereupon depending, to be good, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law and Course of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
                  <p>Then the Lords Appellants proceeded,
and desired to have the fault of Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
recorded, and Judgment given,
and so it was. So likewise 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the King had given the full power of
Parliament to determine all Matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
into the Hands of twelve Lords or
six, and six Commoners, or any three.
He adjourned the Parliament from <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
to <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> in 15 <hi>Hil.</hi> and there
on <hi>March</hi> 22. It was shewed to the King
how that <hi>Robert Possington</hi> was impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the Parliament at <hi>Westminster,</hi> for
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61820:56"/>
being with the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> in levy
at <hi>Herring, An. 11 R.</hi> 2. For which the
said Duke was adjudged as Traytor, and
therefore they brought the King to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
the like Judgment against <hi>Robert
Possington,</hi> though he was dead: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
our Lord the King,<note place="margin">Found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty long time after he was dead, so forfeited his Estate.</note> by the assent
of the Lords and Knights of Counties,
having power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> awarded the said
<hi>Robert</hi> guilty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that he shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But these extraordinary Precedents
cannot lead us into the ordinary course
of Proceedings; and I alledge them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so, as their Errors may be avoided.</p>
                  <p>§. To conclude,<note place="margin">The Party accused to be brought to his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> it is the just and constant
Course of Parliament, to bring the Party
accused to his Answer; yea, though he
fly Justice, yet to send out Proclamations
into the Countries, that he appear at a
Day, or else such and such Judgments
shall be given against him. I confess this
Course was omitted in the Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Mompesson, 18 Jac. and haply
it was not then thought upon; the
Judicature of Parliament being so long
out of use; and therefore that cannot be
alledged as a leading Precedent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:61820:57"/>
And in that Judgment 21 <hi>H.</hi> 6. against
Sir <hi>Jo. Mortymer,</hi> upon an Indictment of
Escape out of Prison, being committed
upon suspition of Treason, the said <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymer</hi>'s
Answer is not recorded; yet it
is said he was brought before the Lords,
and the said Indictment read in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
that he made an Answer unto it,
though not mentioned. And this proves
that the Party is to be brought to his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
else <hi>Mortymer</hi>'s presence had not
been necessary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno 7 R. 2. Numb.</hi> 2. The Duke of
<hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>Gloucester</hi> complained to
the King, That Sir <hi>Tho. Talbot,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
conspired the Death of the said
two Dukes, and prayed the Parliament
to judge thereof. The Fact is judged
High Treason, and Writs sent to divers
Sheriffs to apprehend him, which Writs
were retornable into the <hi>King's-Bench:</hi>
And upon Proclamation made in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>-Hall,
That upon the Sheriffs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and the not-Appearance of the
said <hi>Thomas,</hi> he should be convicted of
Treason, and forfeit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was extraordinary <hi>in terrorem:</hi>
But what may not the whole Parliament
do? They may alter Law much easier
than Form.</p>

                  <p>The Earl did himself the first wrong,
by absenting himself from the House;

Councel antiently was denied to the

21. Sir <hi>Ralph Ferrers</hi> was brought to the
Parliament under the Guard of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal
of <hi>England,</hi> and arraigned at the
King's behalf for suspition of Treason,
who prayed to the King and to the Lords
to have Councel in that Case. Unto
whom it was said, That in all Matters
wherein Councel ought to be granted by
the Law of the Land, the King or Lords
would allow it. And it was further said
unto the said Sir <hi>Ralph,</hi> That forasmuch
as the Matter stands so much upon Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
That by the Law he ought not to
have Councel in his Case, of no earthly
Creature, but obliged himself to answer
at his peril.</p>
                  <p>This last Answer was given upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation.
And 5 <hi>R. 2. Numb.</hi> 44. Sir

200 <hi>l.</hi> from the Prior of St. <hi>John's</hi> of

Councel, which was denied him, for that
the Cause touched Treason.</p>

Articles of Treason and misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor

he had no Councel allowed him; which
was on this occasion:</p>

                     <hi>Anno 21 Jac.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Middlesex</hi>

Misdemeanors only, that Precedent
of 10 <hi>R.</hi> 2. of <hi>Michael de la Poole</hi> being
mistaken, as I conceive. And afterwards
the Lords considering the Inconveniences
that might happen thereby, did order
that Councel should be allowed to all
Delinquents in all Cases generally. At
the Voting of which Order, the King
and Prince were present, and I did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
some Reply thereunto on the King's
behalf, and especially observed whether
the Prince would any ways dislike of it,
either in Words or Countenance; and
he shewed none: which made me verily
believe that he had been acquainted
therewith beforehand; but he was not,
as I shall make it appear.</p>

In this present Parliament, upon read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Articles of Treason and Misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors
against the said Earl 6 <hi>Maij,</hi>
and upon the Earl's Answer to them on
the sudden, The Journal is, The Lords
did answer that he should have Councel
allowed him to plead his Cause. But
on <hi>Monday</hi> the 8th. of <hi>May,</hi> the King sent
a Messenger to them, That he not suing
for a Default in Cases of Treason and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony:
It is an ancient fundamental Law
of this Kingdom, and desired the Lords
to proceed with that Caution, that anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
fundamental Laws may receive no
blemish nor prejudice.</p>
                  <p>On the 15th. of <hi>May,</hi> the Lords an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
this Message, That by an Order
Dated <hi>May 24. 21 Jac. Anno</hi> 1624. Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
was then present, and they had allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> Councel before the
Message came <hi>May</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty is content the Earl of
<hi>Bristol</hi> to have Councel, although his
Majesty knew that by the Law he ought
to have none; but takes Exceptions to
that Order of the 24th. of <hi>May</hi> 1624.
That it was occasioned by the Earl of
<hi>Middlesex,</hi> whose Cause was only Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,

heard for his Majesty; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Majesty is not satisfied about
the general Order, but will advise, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
The Lords thereupon allowed him Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
to plead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Parliament of 6
<hi>Feb. 1 Car.</hi> 1. was dissolved before the
Cause of the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> was heard
and determined, and that the said Earl
was sued in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same Matter contained in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
against him in Parliament: All
which were but Misdemeanors. And if
it be lawful for me to speak freely, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Lords thought they were but
Misdemeanors, when they allowed him
Councel in Parliament: But in Cases of
Misdemeanors only the Party accused
was never denied Councel.</p>

<hi>Michael de la Poole</hi> of many Misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors

Afterwards in the King's Absence, the
Chancellor said first to the Lords, That
he was Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and for
the time represented the King's Person
in his absence; and demanded whether
he ought to answer in the Presence of
the King, since he was impeached of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61820:62"/>

the Lords said, That it was Honest

should be honourable and profitable for
him. The which things unto him were
granted. And the said Chancellor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared

was particularly charged by the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,

                  <p>The Duke being in his Place, and

in Cases of Misdemeanors, when the

For that they in the late Tumults and
Wars confederated with other Misdoers,
did break up the Treasury of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
and compelled the Chancellor and

Liberties,<note place="margin">The Parl. hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled a present An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer iu Misdeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and without Councel.</note> and all Actions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In <hi>Num.</hi>
46 &amp; 47. Several Writs were sent to

Councel, and delivering in the two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leases
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61820:63"/>
which were cancell'd <hi>Numb.</hi> 48.
Then the Chancellor and Scholars exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
divers Articles against them by
way of Petition. Upon the reading
whereof, it was demanded of the said
Mayor and Burgesses what they would
say, why their Liberties should not be
seized into the Kings hands as forfeited?
And they required Copies of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,

<hi>Numb.</hi> 54, 55.</p>
                  <p>To the Copy of the Articles, it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
That inasmuch as they had heard
them read, it should suffice; for by the
Law they ought to have no Copy. And
touching Councel, it was said, That
wherein Councel was to be had, they
should have it; and therefore they were
then to answer to no Crime nor Offence,
but only touching their Liberties, <hi>Numb</hi>
56.</p>
                  <p>After many dilatory Shifts, the said

only saving their Answers to all other
matters, <hi>Numb.</hi> 57.</p>

yielding and increase of Rent, 59. 6. And
there is no farther proceeding against

<hi>Reignald Love</hi> for gain. And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
being present, desired that <hi>Love</hi>
might be examined therein: and he was
examined, and cleared the Lord <hi>Nevil</hi>
thereof. And thereupon <hi>Michael de la
Poole,</hi> and <hi>W. de Winged</hi> being present,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61820:67"/>
did expresly affirm, That the said <hi>Love</hi>
had acknowledged before him and many
others, the Day before, That the said
Lord <hi>Nevile</hi> had bought the said Debt
for gain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the said <hi>Reignald Love</hi> replying
to their Affirmation, said, That he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
spake any such Words to them or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other. <hi>Et tant est autres apres,</hi> &amp;c. And
soon after the said Knights and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
affirming that the said <hi>Reignald</hi>
did not only speak those Words, but also
prayed that it might be shewed in open
Parliament, the said <hi>Reignald</hi> confessed,
That, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and was therefore Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touching the Second Point; The L.
<hi>Nevile</hi> shewed, That he made full Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of his Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touching the Third, The Pillaging of
Souldiers, he said, That he did none;
and if any were done, let the Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
answer. And unto this it was said
by the said Lords of the Parliament, That
it was reason, sith the King paid the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
their Wages, that the Souldiers
should answer for their ill Deeds, and
the Captains should answer for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:61820:67"/>
And thereupon the Commons prayed
Judgment against the Lord <hi>Nevile,</hi> and
that he might be put out of his Office a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the King.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Articles of the Lady
<hi>Ravesholm,</hi> It was awarded in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That the Lord <hi>Nevile</hi> should
make Restitution unto her Executors.
<hi>Quaere hoc.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That he be banished according to the

been, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>The Commons were present at the L.
<hi>Nevil</hi>'s Answer, and desired that one
Witness whom he had brought with
him, and who gave them Information of
the Complaint touching the buying of
the King's Debts, might be examined.
And examined he was in the presence of
two Knights of the Parliament, and they
did contrary his false Answer; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
all the Commons came and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
against the Witness.</p>
                  <p>This is sufficient to prove, That the

was debated at a Committe, whether

was resolved in the Affirmative, upon

our Lord the King answered and
said, That he was in such Governance at

<hi>Roger Mortimer;</hi> and it followeth thus;
Wherefore our Lord the King doth
charge our Earls and Barons, Peers of
this Realm, That forasmuch as these
touch him principally, and all the People
of this Realm, That you do unto the
said <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> right and lawful

                  <p>This was all the Proof produced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Roger Mortimer.</hi> The Lords here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
judged him. But afterwards, <hi>Anno</hi>
28 <hi>E. 3. Numb.</hi> 10. they reversed it as
erroneous: so that although the King's
Testimony, confirmed by the common
Fame, was 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. received against <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

Unto which it was then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
by the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>
by Command of the King, That the

the Articles objected against <hi>Simon de

Liege, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Amongst others, <hi>Simon de

Morrow after the <hi>Purification</hi> of our <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
in the <hi>11th.</hi> year of your Reign, and
there were surmised against him divers
points of Crime and Treason, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
was demanded of every Lord there
present in Parliament, his Advice of the
said <hi>Simon,</hi> touching the said Crime. And
afterwards the said Dukes and Earls of
<hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Warwick</hi> would know your
Advice Thrice Redoubted Lord. You
answer plainly, That the said <hi>Simon de
Burley</hi> was not guilty of any the said
Points, and then they took upon them
traiterously to have constrained you to
have given your Assent to the Judgment
which they have purchased against the
said <hi>Simon</hi> upon the Points aforesaid.
And you Thrice Redoughted Lord would
not consent to any Judgment to be given
against the said <hi>Simon.</hi> And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the aforesaid Dukes and
Earls took upon them Royal Power in

Answer, being dead before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the said Earl
of <hi>Arundel</hi> pleaded the King's Pardon,
which was not allowed him.</p>
                  <p>The said Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> confessed all

himself upon the King's Grace, and the
said <hi>Tho. Mortimer</hi> could not be found.</p>
                  <p>This Parliament begun at <hi>Westminster
Die Lunae post Festum Exaltationis Sanctae
Crucis,</hi> and was adjourned to <hi>Shrewsbury.</hi>
And on <hi>Tuesday 28 January,</hi> the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
there shewed unto the King how
that they in the said Parliament at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
had accused and impeached <hi>John
de Cobham</hi> in the <hi>11th.</hi> year of the King's
Reign, with others convicted in this
Parliament, accroaching to himself Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Power in Judgment. Awarded that
the Lieges of the King, <hi>Simon de Burley</hi>
and <hi>James de Barners</hi> Knights, should be
Drawn, Hanged and Beheaded without
Assent of the King, and against his will,
and in his absence, and in the absence of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61820:79"/>
many other Peers of Parliament, who
with held themselves, and would not sit
in such Judgment, and against their
will, traiterously against the Peace of the
King, his Crown and Dignity.</p>
                  <p>And prayed our Lord the King to cause
the said <hi>John de Cobham</hi> to joyn in this
present Parliament to answer to the
things aforesaid, and to ordain such
Judgment against the said <hi>John de Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
as the Cause demands. The said
<hi>Jo. de Cobham</hi> was brought, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
touching the said Judgment awarded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the said <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> the
said <hi>Joh. de Cobham</hi> said, That it was
told him by them who were present
then, That it was the King's Will to
make such Judgment against the said
<hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>James</hi> convicted of the said
Judgment and Award which he had so
given against the said <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>James,</hi>
notwithstanding his Answer; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Judgment was given against
him, and he adjudged a Traytor.</p>
                  <p>Here is objected, That the Judgment
against <hi>Simon de Burley,</hi> was given by
the Lords without the King's consent.
Secondly, Against his Will. Thirdly, In
the King's Absence. Fourthly, In the
Absence of many of the Peers, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their wills.</p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:61820:79"/>
                  <p>Touching the First, viz. The King's not
Assenting.</p>
                  <p>It may be Objected, That the Lords
gave Judgment against <hi>Weston, 1 R.</hi> 2.
without the King's Assent, but yet not
against the King's Will; for they respited
the Execution until the King might be
informed thereof. And the Reason then
given for the said Respite, was, For that
the King is not yet informed of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of this Judgment. But whether
the Lords proceeded to that Judgment
against <hi>Weston,</hi> before they informed the
King, because the King's Assent is not
necessary, or for that it being the last
Day of the Parliament, they had no lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to inform his Majesty thereof, let
the Reader judge: yet it seemeth to me
that the King's Assent is necessarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in Capital Causes and Judgments,
for these two Reasons:</p>
                  <p>First, For that all Precedents mention
the King's Assent in Capital Judgments,
except that one against <hi>Matrevers, 4 E.</hi> 3.
which might be the omission of the
Clerks, who drew up the Roll; for it is
said directly afterwards in the said Bill,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61820:80"/>
                     <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. That the Peers gave those Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the presence of our Lord the K.
and by his Assent: And except that of
1 <hi>R.</hi> 2. against <hi>Weston,</hi> in the last Day
of the Parliament, and it was 3. in the
Afternoon that Day before the Lords had
determined what to do in that Business;
so that it may be the Lords were prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of time herein, to have which, they
respited Execution, for that the King was
not informed of the manner thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For that the Lords Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants
11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. who had then great Forces
about them, were so earnest with the
King for his Assent to the Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Burley,</hi> That the Duke of <hi>Gloucest.</hi>
told him,<note place="margin">A bold Saying. This Duke of <hi>Glouc.</hi> was many years after imprisoned for this at <hi>Calice,</hi> &amp; there died in his Bed.</note> as appeareth by his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
21 <hi>R. 2. That if he would be King,
he should not intreat for</hi> Simon de Burley,
<hi>to save him from Death.</hi> And in the end,
when his Majesty would not assent to
their Judgment, yet they wrought so,
that Messengers were sent unto him, and
brought word (not before they gave
Judgment against <hi>Simon</hi>) and the King's
Assent is mentioned in the said Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
All which the said Lords would
not have done, had not the King's Assent
been necessary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:61820:80"/>
And afterwards in the Parliament of 21
<hi>R.</hi> 2, The Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> being accused for
giving Judgment without the King's As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
answered, That the Messenger
brought word, That his Majesty had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented:
And yet because he did not gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say
that the King did deny his Assent, the
Commons immediately demanded Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
All which seem to imply, That
the King's Assent is necessary in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon Capital Offences.</p>

saith <hi>(de jure, interesse non debemus)</hi> but I
think it intends that they could not be
present by reason of the Common-Law,
and by reason of an Ordinance made at
the Councell at <hi>Westminster,</hi> in 21. <hi>H.</hi> 2.
By which all <hi>Clergy</hi>-men were forbidden,

For surely as I think, they might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
have been present both by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law
and by the Law of God. But
by such their long constant absence, even
from our first Parliaments upon Record.
The Lords Temporal have only heard and

do any way meddle with such Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
either touching the Answers, the
Replyes, the Proofs, or the Judgement.
For where they may not adjudg, they
may not do any thing as a Judge that
doth conduce to judgment. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as heretofore they would be absent,
Now they cannot be present whilst the

                     <p>In 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. Judgment was given by the
Earls, Barons and Peers, as Judges in

understood of the Temporal Lords

                     <p>The King commanded the Lords Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,

what Process to make, and what Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to render against the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi>
and the Lord <hi>Bardolph.</hi> The

their Opinions to the King. The said
Lords, Peers of the Realm, by Assent
of the King, Ordain, That Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
should be made for the said Earl and
Lord <hi>Bardolph</hi> to appear, or else to be
Convicted by Award of the Peers in
Parliament.</p>
                     <p>The King did farther demand the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of the said Lords Temporal touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Archbishop of <hi>York;</hi> unto whom
the said Lords Temporal said, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Commons prayed the King that

by Advice of the Lords Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
the Returns of the former Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations

                     <p>By Advice of the said Lords Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
the Returns of the former Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
were examined, the said Lords

therein.</p>
                     <p>By the said Lords Temporal, with
the Assent of the King, by their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
New Proclamation is granted, the
Return whereof is read in full Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before the King and the said Lords

                     <p>Whereupon, the said Lords Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

by their Authority in Parliament, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
the said, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Convict of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                     <p>Here all was done by the Lords Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
from the first beginning of the
Trial until the Judgment, and yet the
Judgment is said to be in Full Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
notwithstanding the Spiritual
Lords are not once mentioned, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be present at any time whilst
the Matter of Treason was handled.</p>

                  <p>I observe the Presence of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to be necessary at the Parties An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
and Judgment in Cases Capital.</p>
                  <p>Now one Reason for the King's Assent,
and the Commons presence in such Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
may be this; Both King and
People are to be satisfied for the death
of the Subject; therefore all Trials for
Life and Death, are publick in the full
Assembly of the Court: And how can
it be said in Full Parliament, when the
Commons, one of the States, are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:61820:88"/>
For this purpose the Court of Requests
(called <hi>Camera Alba</hi>) was prepared for
such Trials, where both Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
might meet more conveniently;
yet though the Commons were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at such times, they had no Voice
there. But at their Return to their own
Assembly, they considered among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
if the Proceedings were Legal;
and might come again and shew it, and
require a Rehearsing of that Cause: as
they did at the Judgment of the Duke
of <hi>Clarence, 18 E.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Nor are the Commons to be present
when the Lords do consider of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent's
Answer, and the Proofs, and
do determine of their Judgment.</p>

Then the Commons were present; but
I do not find that they were present with

when the Lords advised on the

                     <p>After the Lords had Awarded Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61820:89"/>
a Day, or Judgment to be given. The
Commons not being acquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
they came and prayed the King,
they might have cognizance what was
done touching the said Rebellions of
<hi>Salop,</hi> and elsewhere-within the Realm:
whereupon, New Proclamations were
made, and the subsequent proceedings
were done in full Parliament, in presence
of the Commons; and the Record saith,
upon the Request of the Commons. A
Question hath been often asked, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Commons did heretofore sit at
Conference with the Lords? Which I
cannot very well resolve; but verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
That at all these Arraignments
the Commons did sit with the Lords.</p>
                     <p>10 <hi>R. 2. Gomeniz</hi> and <hi>Weston</hi> were
brought before the Lords and Commons
sitting in the <hi>White Chamber.</hi> The
Words are, <hi>Devant les Seignieurs avant

Commons are here intended by the
Words <hi>en plein Parlement.</hi> And so was
the Commons Demand, that they may
be tried before the Lords.</p>
                     <p>No other Records speak whether they

were present at all the Answers of those
whom they Impeached, and demanded
Judgment.</p>
                     <p>And when the Lords had rendred
their Judgment against the Lord <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
to be prisoner with the Marshal,
and to make Fine and Ransom to the
King, the Commons prayed the King,
he might also be put out of all his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
and especially from being Privy
Councellor: Which the King grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>And when the Lords had determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one part of the Complaint of the

a wrong done to certain <hi>Scottish</hi>
Merchants, the Commons prayed a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Enquiry might be made of the
Residue whereof they complained; which
the Lords granted.</p>
                     <p>And when the Lord <hi>Nevil</hi> Answered,
They required that one <hi>Richard Love</hi>
might be examined, to prove that which
the said Lord denied, and they depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61820:90"/>
but two of the Commons remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and heard the Examination, and
told the Lords, That the said <hi>Richard</hi>
had related it to the Commons other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the day before; which the said <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
denied. Then all the Commons
came and justified it again, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the said <hi>Richard Love</hi> confessed it,
and on their Demands was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>This shews what Interest they have
in their own Impeachments.</p>
                     <p>So in 10 <hi>R.</hi> 2. When the Commons
had Impeached the Lord Chancellor,
They were present at his Answer, and
so often Replied, and enforced his Oath
against him, and required him to be
Committed, and so he was before Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but Bayled presently.</p>
                     <p>But if the Commons do only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
and do neither impeach the Party
in Writing, nor by word of Mouth in
open House, nor demand Trial to be in
their Presence; In these Cases it is in
the Election of the Lords whether the
Commons shall be present or not.</p>
                     <p>And therefore when they complained
of <hi>Alice Peirce, 10 R.</hi> 2. The Lords de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
her Trial until the Departure of
the Parliament, that is, till the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61820:91"/>
had leave to depart. And if the
Commons presence be not necessary in
such Cases where they complain, much
less is it wherein they complain not;
yet they have been present when they
did not complain; but that was upon an
extraordinary Cause, <hi>prout 7 R.</hi> 2.</p>
                     <p>A Fishmonger exhibited his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
first to the Commons against the
Lord Chancellor, and afterwards to the
Lords in Full Parliament, in presence of
the Commons. But they were present
no doubt at the Lord Chancellor's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
That he might clear himself in

Here may be Objected that which
<hi>Tresilian</hi> and other Judges answered to
one of the King's Questions, 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2.
touching the Judgment of <hi>Michael de la
Poole,</hi> That the same Justices and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants
would not give the same Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
because it seemeth to them, that
the same is irrevocable, as erroneous to
every part. <hi>Vid.</hi> Print. Stat. 21 <hi>R.</hi> 2.
<hi>Tresilian</hi> was much mistaken, as much
as in the other Answers, whereby he
determined that to be Treason; and so
here he gave his Advice, not his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
And yet he saith, he gave his
Consent. Read but a little further, and
you shall find in the very same place, as
followeth; Which Questions and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
as well before the King, as before
the Lords and Commons, were read and
perceived; and it was demanded of all
the States of Parliament, how they
thought of the Answer? And they said,
They thought the Justices made and
gave the Answers duly and lawfully, as
good and liege People of the King ought
to do.</p>
                     <p>And in the same manner Sir <hi>Tho.</hi> of

Rickill,</hi> Justice of the Common Bench,
and after the coming of my Lord <hi>William

Wherefore the said Answers be judged

Her Offence being only for procuring Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

but not set down how much to the

                     <p>These Fines were not put in certain,
for that the Law limits them to the
King's Will: But not doubt but after
the Judgment, the Lords did rate them;
as may be gathered out of <hi>Richard Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi>
where, after Judgment, they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him before them, to consider, it
seems, at what Rate to Tax the same.
And they found it not sufficient.</p>

                     <p>I hold that anciently the Fines were

of the Lords, by <hi>Richard le Scroop,</hi>
Chief Steward of the House of our Lord
the King, in manner following:</p>
               <p>Here the Lords commanded the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment
of certain Earls, Peers of
the Realm: They did not appoint the
Steward to do it: It belonged to his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno 20 R. 2. Thomas Haxey</hi> was Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned
of High Treason before the
King, the Lords and Commons in full

                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:61820:98"/>
                  <hi>Anno 21 R.</hi> 2. All those Judgments
on the Appeal were rendred <hi>per Senes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>challum
Angliae.</hi> The Records of <hi>E.</hi> 3. and
<hi>H.</hi> 4. are silent herein, by whom the
Judgment was rendred.</p>
               <p>It may be Objected,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> That <hi>Anno 5. H.</hi>
4. The Lord Chancellor kept his place
at the Trial of the Earl of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
because he did deliver the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Lords.</p>
               <p>That could not properly be called a
Trial; for it was upon the Earl's own
Petition. And if it were resolved whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were Felony or Treason, it
should have been done by the Steward,
sitting in the Chancellor's place. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth it appear by the Record, that
the Chancellor kept his place, though
he afterwards delivered the Opinion of
the Lords.</p>
               <p>So likewise, <hi>Anno 1 Car. 1. Febr.</hi> 6.
The Lord Keeper kept his place when
the Articles of Treason were read a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Earl of <hi>Bristol;</hi> but he did
not Arraign him. Then they were
read, and his Answer heard by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of the House, and some Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61820:99"/>
examined also, to the end they
might understand the true Nature of
his Offence, and then to declare how,
and in what manner to proceed against
him for the same.</p>
               <p>The Spiritualty did not deliver their
Opinion therein.</p>
               <p>To conclude, All Records that are
(which mention by whom the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
in Cases Capital were Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
do say that it was by the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
of <hi>England,</hi> or of the King's House,
And in remembrance of this, a Lord
Steward is appointed at every Trial of
a Peer of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Touching Judgment rendred by the
Chancellor in Cases of Misdemeanors,
it is needless to recite any Precedents:
only this I will say, The Chancellor
never gave Judgment on Life and Death,
and the Steward never on Misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors.</p>
               <p>And though there be Precedents of
Judgments given by the Steward of
<hi>England</hi> in Parliament, <hi>prout 20 &amp; 21
R.</hi> 2. yet I have seen none of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on the Peers rendred by the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61820:99"/>
Steward of the King's House: And the
reason may be, for that there was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
a <hi>Seneschallus Angliae. Quaere
tamen</hi> whether the Steward of the King's
House, being a Peer, may give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on a Peer or not. I think he
may, if there be no Steward of the
House constantly made every Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
though but during the Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

had each of them twenty pounds
Awarded for their Damages; and it
is not there declared how they should
recover the same.</p>
               <p>In the same year <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Nevile,</hi>
upon Complaint of the Commons, is

               <p>In those two Cases, I conceive the
Parties are to have their Remedy (the
Parliament being ended) in the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi>

Court at the Common Law: But the
Lords in Parliament may direct how it
shall be Levied.</p>

Restitution made.</p>
