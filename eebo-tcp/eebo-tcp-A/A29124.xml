         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If our Life and Fortune depend not on the Stars, then it's to be granted, that the Astrologers Seek where nothing is to be found, but we are so fond, mistrustful, and credulous, that we fear more of the Fables of <hi>Robin Good-Fellow,</hi> Astrologers, and Witches, and believe more things that, are not, then the things that are, and the more impossible a thing is, the more we stand in fear thereof; and the less likely to be true, the more we believe it, and if we were not such, I think that those Deceivers, Astrologers, Couzenors, and Blasphemors, if they had no other way or Employment to get an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Lively-hood, they would dye for hunger.</p>
            <p>Our foolish light Beleif, forgeting things past, neglecting things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and very hasty to know things to come; so that if by our Astrologers, one Truth be spoken by hap, it giveth such Creddit to all their Lyes, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after we believe whatsoever they say, how incredible, impossible, or false soever it be, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But now I shall proceed to my Prophecy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:30052:2"/>According to the Constellations of the Stars which I converse with, there will happen (<hi>Anno.</hi> 1687.) a Great Rot amongst the <hi>Quack</hi> Doctors, but they will not be half so much pitty'd, as if it had hapned in <hi>Rumney</hi> Marsh, for the Honest can spare them, and those as are not, will have no cause to Lament, for they oftner kill than cure.</p>
            <p>Likewise they have so daubed every Post, nay there is hardly a Creek or Corner in or about <hi>London,</hi> but a Man shall be disturbed with the Appearitions of the <hi>Quacks,</hi> (even at Noon Day) in making Water; for right before you, there stands <hi>No Cure no Money,</hi> or <hi>No Money till the Cure be performed;</hi> but when a Gentleman has Occasion, it's <hi>No Medicine without producing the Ready.</hi> And above him stands, <hi>A Speedy Cure without Mercury:</hi> Also either to the right or left, there is an Appearition cloathed all in Black, known by the Name of <hi>Aqua Tetrachymagogon,</hi> but for my part I have nothing to say against him, because I am One as hates Reflections upon the Ingenious: Than too near him stands <hi>Medela ab Alto,</hi> in <hi>Fanchurch-street</hi> near <hi>Magpy-ally;</hi> and now and then a Female Spirit appears, and immediately vanisheth. And last of all, which is the dreadfulest, appears, <hi>Yah Coronzon Otheos On Panthon Bohu Tohu,</hi> or <hi>Read, Try, Judge, and speak as you find</hi> &amp;c.
