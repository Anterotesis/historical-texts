         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Honor knows I have ever been afraid of
the Preſs hitherto I have ſtood out againſt all
importunity, and I was peremptorily reſolved
never to have publiſhed any thing in Print:
but now I am inforced, whether I wil or no,
to ſend abroad theſe two ſmal pieces. And
ſince they muſt out, I humbly preſent them to
your Ladyſhip: Not for any worth that is in them: Not for your
Honors protection of them; let them go forth at their own peril:
nor yet for the ſubjects ſake; the matter of them in the general
not ſo directly, and properly complying with your Ladyſhips condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
they are rather for the inſtruction of Magiſtrates: But
I dedicate them to your Honor: becauſe they are your due.
Whatever I can perform in the ſervice of God, and more by
far then ever I am able to do, low to the <hi>gracious Lady Frances.</hi> To
ſay truth, your Honor called for them, and here they are: take them
with favorable acceptation. Something your Ladyſhip wil meet
withal in both Sermons appliable and uſeful in regard of your ſelf.
The <hi>NAIL</hi> (I mean the <hi>good Nail</hi>) wil give your Honor a freſh
ſight of that Noble Gentleman, worthy Sir <hi>JOHN
HOBARTE,</hi> your Honors lately deceaſed huſband. He was
a <hi>gallant Nail:</hi> by the grace of God wel filed from all ruſt and
ruggedneſs: He was a <hi>bright Nail,</hi> as burniſhed gold, ſhining more
and more every day he lived (that I can teſtifie to the comfort of
my ſoul) by a godly converſation. He was a <hi>great</hi> and a <hi>ſtrong
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102714:3"/>
Nail:</hi> His abilities were beyond the common pitch: He had a
good head for wiſdom and underſtanding: He had a good heart;
Faithful and zealous he was for God, for Religion, for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
for our <hi>Solemn Covenant:</hi> He was a <hi>fixed Nail</hi> not only in
the Capitol, but alſo in the Sanctuary: his care and painful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors
were layd out not only for the Common-wealth, but for
the Church alſo: yea he himſelf was a little ſuncturary to the
faithful Maniſters of Jeſus Chriſt. He was a <hi>ſtout Nail,</hi> ſteeled
with Chriſtian reſolution and courage; not counting his life dear
if he might have ſacrificed it (as partly he did) for the Kingdoms
peace, his Countries ſafety and the Churches ſettlement. He was
a <hi>Nail</hi> on which the Welfare and proſperity of our <hi>Sion</hi> did
much depend. And for our ſins God hath plucked out this
uſeful <hi>Nail.</hi> We ſee this great <hi>Nail</hi> turned into a little <hi>Wheel:</hi>
and he is now rolled into the Houſe appointed for all the living.
I wil not tel the world of your Ladiſhips immoderate ſorrow, and
how you ſit diſconſolate, ſighing, ſobbing, and mourning like a
faithful Turtle bereaved of her mate: I wil rather guide my
ſpeech to your Honor, and direct your eye to the <hi>Wheel. Worthy
Sir John Hobarte,</hi> he was a <hi>ſtately Wheel,</hi> he moved bravely in his
time, and did much of Gods work with all alacrity; yea he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that life worſe then death, when his motion was any whit ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
by infirmity of body, ſo as he could not be active in the Publick
ſervice as he deſired. This <hi>Voluble,</hi> and <hi>ſwift Wheel,</hi> is now bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
at the Ciſtern: and your heart <hi>Madam,</hi> was almoſt broken
too. Oh! I beſeech your Honor, look up to the throne of glory;
it is the voice of the Lord hath turned the Wheel: He hath ſpok<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n,
and hath done it. Submit, Submit with humility, patience, cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.
Rejoyce rather: what a world of comforts may your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhip
have in your loſs? He did worthily in his life, he dyed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly:
I ſaw him draw his laſt breath: but ſo much Majeſty,
and peace in a dying countenance I never ſaw. A ſtranger would
have thought he had been only in ſome ſweet-contenting ſleep, or
taſting the heavenly joys. What an Honorable name hath he left
behind him! Is it not as an oyntment powred forth, even as the
fragrant ſpikenard? The <hi>Nail</hi> is pulled out of this lower wall, but
it is not loſt: it's only advanced, and ſet up higher. He is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtned
in the wall of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> he ſhines, and ever ſhal ſhine
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102714:3"/>
bright in glory. And we all ere long ſhal roul after him; and
then ſhal your Ladyſhip enjoy a better Communion with your huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
then ever. Be content to waite, is it not a little while?</p>
            <p>I intended a very ſhort Epiſtle, but my pen begins to be free,
and eager of its way. I can hardly hold it in: it would fain be
dropping out ſomething of your honors goodneſs. I wel know how
little your Honor affects the praiſe of men (your praiſe is in the
Goſpel) and your Ladiſhip wel knows how much I abhorr baſe
flattery. And God he knows, my deſign is not to make you proud
by ſpeaking your vertues to your face, but only this; I would
moſt gladly take occaſion to publiſh ſomething to the world of thoſe
eminent Graces, which the Lord hath wrought in your Honor by his
holy ſpirit: that your Ladiſhips example may be propounded as a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
to all Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſtian women, which they may ever look upon, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
Elect Lady! I could tel them, how I have ever found you
walking in the truth, even in the moſt perilous and ſeducing times:
with what obedience you have always heard the word, reſigning
up your wil to Gods Command: How your deportment was to your
Noble yoke-fellow: the heart of your huſband did ſafely truſt in
you: All that were but lookers on, did ſee t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e entireneſs of your
heart, the intention of your love, your loyalty, and faithfulneſs,
joyned with all diligence, and care. You made in your ſtudy and
work, to do him good in regard of his body, in regard of his eſtate;
but eſpecially, and above all in regard of his ſoul. I could take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
by this my dedication to tel the world: That even whileſt
you are on earth, your converſation is in heaven. I can truly te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify
that your Ladiſhip is a widow indeed, continuing in faſting,
and prayer, and reading, and meditation; and that this is your
work night and day in the temple, in your cloſet, in your family:
That's remarkable; in your family you obſerve <hi>Davids</hi> houres.
Every morning, every noon, and every night you have prayer,
Scripture read and expounded (and that by an able, and a called
Minister of the Goſpel) beſides repetitions of Sermons, ſinging of
Pſalms, and conſtant Catechiſing (a moſt neceſſary work) the
Noble Olive-plant, your precious daughter anſwering with the
firſt, with all readyneſs, and cheerfulneſs, to her immortal honor.
I confeſs hearing the anſwers of young <hi>Mrs. Philip Hobarte,</hi> and
the reſt, I could not but think thus with my ſelf: This day is that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102714:4"/>
Propheſy fulfilled in mine eares. I wil powre out of my ſpirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
all fleſh, and your ſons, and your daughters ſhal Propheſy,
and your young men ſhal ſee Viſions; and on my ſervants, and on
my hand-maids wil I pour out of my ſpirit, and they ſhal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy.</p>
            <p>Madam! Wil not your honor be offended if I ſhow my folly, and
boaſt a little to the world? You are <hi>my glory, my Crown, and
my rejoycing:</hi> the comfortable Harveſt, <hi>and precious Seal</hi> of my
Miniſtry. And this is diſcerned by others, as wel as by my ſelf.
Your paralel is not to be found: or at the leaſt, ſcarcely was ever
any Chriſtian ſeen, who did thrive, and grow ſo faſt in Grace as
your Honor hath done, eſpecially of late years. Now, if either your
Honor or any others that ſhal caſt their eye on theſe my free ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
and think me indiſcreet in writing thus to your Honor:
I Apologize for my ſelf in the words of Chriſt when he prayed vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,
and loud at <hi>Lazarus</hi> his grave; Not for your ſake Madam!
but becauſe of the people which ſtand by, I ſaid it. I propound
a pattern to other Chriſtians, and other families: and my ſole
aim is, the glory of God, and the provoking of many to a holy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.</p>
            <p>The God of heaven and earth; the God of my father bleſs your
Honor, and your noble and hopeful daughter. I beg for you the
upper and the nether ſprings. The God of all Grace perfect all
Grace in you: be filled with the Spirit, with inward peace and
joy of the Holy Ghoſt. Be the Lords darling. Beleeve me Gracious
Lady! The tongue ſhal cleave to the roof of my mouth, and my
right hand ſhal forgets its skil: before I ſhal ceaſe to bear your
Honors name at my heart: and to preſent it unto the Lord as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as I appear at the throne of Grace.<note place="margin">July 23. 1647.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Be ſure Madam! I am
Your Honors moſt humbly Devoted ſervant for ever. Thankful
for your Superlative favour, bounty, and care. And</p>
            <p>As under God your Honor raiſed me from the grave. So (if I
can beleeve mine own heart) I am your Honors faithful
Paſtor: who if God ſhould call him to it, would willingly lay
down his life to eſtabliſh your Ladiſhip in the truth and
grace of Jeſus Chriſt, and to further your eternal Salvation.</p>

                     <p>The uſe of ſuch a nail, orpeg, or ſpirkit is to hang thingsout of hand;

                        <hi>A.</hi> I anſwer. There was another nail pul'd out, and he was put
in, in the room.</p>
                     <p>The other nail, <hi>viz.</hi> his predeceſſor was <hi>Shebna:</hi> he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived,
and <hi>Eliakim</hi> ſubſtituted in his room: therefore let's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what place <hi>Shebna</hi> was in, and then all wil be clear.</p>
                     <p>Some of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, and learned <hi>Hierom</hi> with them,
conceive that <hi>Shebna</hi> was the high-prieſt. <hi>Lyra, Sanchez, Lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
Pintus, Tirinus,</hi> and moſt of the Popiſh-writers are of the ſame
opinion: Their arguments are principally.</p>
                     <p>”Firſt, the authority of the old-Vulgar-latine tranſlation of the
15. verſe (which with them is authentick) <hi>Vade ad Sobnam prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum
templi.</hi> Go to <hi>Shebna</hi> the overſeer of the temple: that is
(ſay they) the high-prieſt.</p>
                     <p>”Again, from the 21. verſe, where it is ſaid; and I wil cloth
him with thy robe, and ſtrengthen him with thy girdle: they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
thoſe garments, to be the Veſtments of the high prieſt: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that in the 20. of <hi>Num. v,</hi> 28. <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſtripped</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
<hi>of his garments, and put them on</hi> Eleazar <hi>his ſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But certainly, if we go to the fountain, this can never be made
out, that <hi>Shebna</hi> was high-Prieſt, or any Prieſt of the ſecond or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
For,</p>

                        <hi>ſuper domum dei.</hi> Over the houſe; there's not ſo much as
a hint that it ſhould be over the houſe of God.</p>
                     <p>”Again, <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>The robe, and girdle</hi> were enſigns of authority,
and Magiſtracy: <hi>Job</hi> mentions the girdle of Kings. <hi>Baltheum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum
diſſolvit:</hi> Job 12. 18. He looſeth the bond, or girdle of Kings,
and thus did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> he <hi>arrayed him in royal robes, and
put a golden chain,</hi> or girdle about him. Gen. 41. 42.</p>
                     <p>So here: I wil cloth him with thy robe; that is, that robe
which thou didſt wear when thou wert the great manat Court.</p>
                     <p>”Yet further, he was not capable of the office of Prieſt-hood.
They which received the office of Prieſt-hood were all of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Levi:</hi> but <hi>Shebna</hi> was of another ſtock, not ſo much as
a <hi>Jew,</hi> but an <hi>Alian,</hi> a ſtranger. That is obliquely ſignifyed, and
intimated, verſe the 16. <hi>What haſt thou here? and whom haſt
thou here? that thou haſt hewed thee out a Sepulchre here &amp;c.</hi>
which is, as if he ſhould have ſaid: what buſineſs haſt thou in this

Land? what kindred? Why ſhouldeſt thou take up thy reſt to live,
and dye in the Lords land, and to be buried in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
thou art an <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> or of ſome other ſtrange Country?</p>
                     <p>”To put all out of queſtion. There was another high prieſt at
the very ſame time; <hi>Azariah</hi> by name: you ſhal read of him, 2.
<hi>Chron.</hi> 31. 13. He was ruler of the houſe of God; that is by the
conſent of all interpreters, the high prieſt: and therefore <hi>Shebna,</hi>
what ever he were, could not be the high prieſt.</p>
                     <p>What was he then? Let's gather up his titles of honor together,
and by that time we have done, we ſhal underſtand his place cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In the 15. verſe he is called, firſt, <hi>the treaſurer,</hi> and then <hi>Sheb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na

37. Chapter of this Propheſy:<note place="margin">2. Kings 19 2.</note> 
                        <hi>verſe</hi> the 2. and often other-where

Scribe, or notary; but ſuch an one as we call <hi>a Chancellor or
Secretary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is then the ſum of all: <hi>Shebna</hi> was at that time the great
favorite of the King: he had all the chief offices, the higheſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
and dignitys of the Kingdom conferred upon him. He was
Lord treaſurer: he was ruler, Governor, Controller of the Kings
houſe; he was the Lord Chancellor, and Secretary of ſtate. In a
word, he was the chief in Court, and Kingdom, and under the
King, <hi>Lord Preſident</hi> of the whole Country; juſt as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was
under <hi>Pharaoh:</hi>

But as for this <hi>Eliakim,</hi> ſaith the Lord, I wil ſix him in a ſolid

nor be pluck'd out: that is plainly, I wil ſo confirm, and eſtabliſh him

Upon him hangs the care of the Scriptures: He muſt ſee it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed

to protect, and encourage them doing wel, to correct, and

Eccleſiaſtical Government, to ſettle Church diſcipline, by good

                     <p>Let's look them all over, and take notice how they are fixed, and
what hangs on them.</p>
                     <p>1. The higheſt Nayls: they are the Magiſtrates, and Rulers.
Ther's a goodly row of them: but let's ſee what ſervice they do in
their places: What hangs on then? what burden do they bear?</p>
                     <p>Ther's ſome of the greater ſort of Nayls, look what hangs on
them? Truly ſcarce any thing, unleſſe it be a ſcarlet gown, or the
enſignes of authority, or a rich furniſhed table, bottles, and flagons,
delicious diſhes, and a deale of Kitchin-ſtuff. But what ſervice do
they as Magiſtrates? Truly nothing at all, that I can diſcern, either
for Church or Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are only a kind of emboſſed nayls, ſuch as are driven into
garments,<note place="margin">Veſtimenta clavata.</note> collars, coaches, trappings of horſes, chaires, and other
things, only for ſtate, and ornament: they have great and glorious
boſſed, and gilded heads, but a little ridiculous ſtalk, hardly enough
to hold their own, or to keep them from falling out of their places:
they are ſo cloſe driven, that nothing can hang on them.</p>
                     <p>There are other of the high Nayls hang very full of things: But
of what? Are they veſſels of the Sanctuary? Oh no ſuch matter;
they bear up a deal of the Devils houſhold-ſtuff.</p>
                     <p>Upon one there hangs a company of drunken ale-houſes, ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
prophane perſons, Sabbath-breakers, cheaters, and ſharks,
theſe are upheld, and born up bythem, when honeſt men are thrown
down to the ground.</p>
                     <p>Upon another hangs a knot of <hi>Anabaptiſts, Antinomians, Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,
Independents,</hi> and others of the ſame bran, diſturbers of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
peace; theſe are countenanced, and born up on high, whileſt
the Orthodox party are ſleighted, caſt off, and ſuffered to fall flat on
the ground.</p>
                     <p>Upon another depends a cluſter of perſons Popiſhly affected, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102714:11"/>
lignants, Incendiaries: ſuch as theſe are born up, and born out too
upon all occaſions.</p>
                     <p>Oh there's too—too many ſuch rotten, ruſty, miſimployed nails.</p>
                     <p>2. The middle nails: they are the Miniſters of the word, the
Clergy, as they call them; wel what hangs upon the moſt of them?
What but a plurality of livings? A black gown, or Canonical coat?
A ſervice-book,<note place="margin">The inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a fooliſh ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard. Zach. 11. 15. Ezek. 34. 4.</note> or book of homilys? There did hang a while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
abundance of Copes, Surpliſſes, Alters, Crucifixes, Images,
and ſuch traſh, til they were taken down by a ſtrong hand. But
for powerful, and frequent preaching, prayer, and the weighty
works of the Miniſtry, as <hi>ſtrengthening the weak, healing the
ſick, binding up the broken, bringing again that which was driven
away, and ſeeking that which was loſt:</hi> there's nothing of all theſe
to be ſeen amongſt them. Are theſe indeed for the glory of their
fathers houſe?</p>
                     <p>3. The loweſt ſort of nails; they are the ordinary people, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and Commons.</p>
                     <p>Oh! What abundance of empty nails do we ſee round about?
Nothing at all hangs upon them: only they take up a place in the
wall. There is a generation of Gentlemen, and others, and wel
parted men too, able to undergo good ſervice: and yet live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

had ſcraped together, and left them: but they wil not put
under their ſhoulder to bear any burden of profitable employment in
Church or Commonwealth. See, ſee what commonly hangs upon them:
bundles of hair, <hi>Sampſons</hi> locks, buſhy periwigs, dogs, dice, drabs,
cards, and tables, bottels of generous wine, and flagons of ſtrong
drink, red eyes, ſwollen bellys, and black ſouls: nothing elſe at all:
Gentlemen! are theſe things for the glory of your fathers houſe?</p>
                     <p>There are a company of idle Vagrants, and ſturdy Rogues that
wander up and down the ſtreets, and lanes, and high-ways: ragged
nails, that ſtick out almoſt every where, whetherſoever we go, and
are ready to catch our garments, and tear us almoſt in pieces: and
there's nothing hangs on them but the ſweat of other mens brows,
purſes, and garments, and ſuch things as they have torn from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
paſſengers.</p>

                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:102714:11"/>
Others there are of all ſorts, that indeed are cruelly loaden: there
hangs upon them huge bundles of oaths, rapine, Blaſphemies, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
Treaſons, railings, filthy ſpeeches, and all kind of ſins: but
they wil bear no burden of ſervice in the Church, or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                     <p>Whereto ſhal I liken this accurſed generation? They are like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

taken thereof to do any work? Or wil men make a pin thereof to
hang a veſſel thereon?</hi> No, No, the Vine-ſtalk, if once cut up,
wil not make a peg to hang a bottel on, it wil not be profitable for

                     <p>But what's the end? Behold it's caſt into the fire for fewel, the
fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midſt of it is burnt; <hi>is it

Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God:<note place="margin">Ezek. 15. 6. 7.</note>

I give them; and I wil ſet my face againſt them, they ſhal go out
from one fire, and another fire ſhal devour them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Surely ſuch nails as theſe ſhal not be ſuffered to ſtand long in the
wall: if a man ſee a nail ſtick up in his houſe of no uſe, wil he not
preſently knock it out? There were abundance of ſuch nails as
theſe in <hi>Juda,</hi> and God knocked them out, and threw them into
<hi>Babylon.</hi> Chriſt himſelf paſſeth ſentence upon all ſuch. <hi>Caſt that
unprofitable ſervant into utter darkneſs, there ſhal be weeping and

                     <p>Hear, and tremble all you uſeleſs nails! You unprofitable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
of the earth! Be you men, or women, that take up places in

                           <item>1. Magiſtrates.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>The 1. Exhortation, to the Magiſtrates. You are all nails, ſome
higher, ſome lower. Remember that you are not for ornament on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but chiefly, and principally for uſe. In the name of God let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one in his place do the office of a nail. Truly all things in the
Church and Common-wealth lye diſorderly at this time, or hang
very dangerouſly, and ready to fall and miſcarry. I beſeech you let
it be your care to uphold things; let every nail bear ſomething, yea
though you weaken your ſelves for the common good.</p>
                     <p>Take your charge in ſome particulars, and that very ſhortly: I
ſpeak to wiſe men: a word wil ſuffice.</p>
                     <p>1. Keep the peace. Magiſtrates! know your office, you are all
Commiſſioners for the peace: and this is that which we are enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to pray for you in authority:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>That under you we may lead a
quiet and a peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The nail holds things together when they are hanged upon it,
which lay ſcattered and ſundred one from another before. Yes, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one good pin they keep cloſe. How are the people of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
at this time devided amongſt themſelves! How are they ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered!
and ſcattered? One here, another there; one of this mind,
another of another.</p>
                     <p>Oh ye Rulers of the people! Uſe your pains and skil to bring
them together again into one mind, and one judgment, that they may
hang upon you, as grapes upon the ſtalk, in one cluſter. Endeavor
with all your might the peace of the Church and Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>2. Be ready at hand to do juſtice at all times. We knock up nails
and pegs in our houſes, that we may hang things upon them of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
uſe; things that we would have always at hand: as for things
of leſſer uſe, we lock them up in cheſts and cabbinets, and it matters
not though they ſee the Sun but ſeldom. Magiſtrates muſt be ready
at hand, at all times, to hear the grievances of the oppreſſed, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
vice, to encourage vertue, to relieve the wronged, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
to help the fatherleſſe, and the widow to their right, ſhortly to
do juſtice readily and freely upon all occaſions. The nayl eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives

at all times what ever is put upon it.</p>
                     <p>Some Magiſtrates, I doubt, we have, that in this are like unto
nayls, they will not in, without greaſing, and knocking: you ſhal
not get them to do their duty, except they be greaſed with a bribe,
or beaten to it by fear. Otherwiſe, with <hi>Foelix,</hi> they are not at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to do juſtice. I pray remember a womans anſwer. She petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the King for juſtice:<note place="margin">Act. 24. 26.</note> (it was, I take it, <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>)
he told her, he was not now at leaſure. Not at leaſure, ſaith
ſhee, to do juſtice? Why then art thou at leaſure to be a King? If
a nayl be not at leaſure to bear veſſels, knock it out; why doth it
trouble the wall?</p>

Be careful, and circumſpect in your choice. You are
to look about for nails, on which to hang the weighty affairs of the
Church, Common-wealth and City: ſee that you chuſe ſuch as may
be ſerviceable in their places, wel-qualified nails.</p>

<hi>Jethro's</hi> Counſel.</p>
                     <p>1. You muſt chuſe able and ſtrong nails: They muſt have abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of mind:<note place="margin">Clavus capita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> You muſt pick out ſuch nails as have good heads, and
ſharp points; ſuch as have good underſtanding, wiſdom, and ſolidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and alſo ſome acuteneſs of wit and pleaſantneſs, amiableneſs of
converſation.<note place="margin">Pſal 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10.</note> 
                        <hi>Be wiſe ye Kings, be learned you Judges, ſaith</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid:
if they ought to be ſo, then it's your duty to chuſe none but
ſuch as appear ſo.</p>
                     <p>There are a ſort of nails (ſpikins I think they call them) they want
heads: and ſo whatſoever is hang'd upon them ſlips of: Take heed
of chuſing Spikin Magiſtrates; for if you hang the great affairs of
the Common-wealth upon them, they wil certainly let them fall
and miſcarry becauſe they want heads to hold them.</p>
                     <p>They muſt alſo have abilities of body, and of eſtate: without
competent bodily ſtrength they wil never be able to endure watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and travailing, and long ſitting on the bench: and beleeve me
wealth is needful. Magiſtrates had need be able, rich men: They
muſt carry out things with ſome pomp, and ſtate, elſe they wil be
contemn'd; and their authority diſ-regarded. <hi>Ad populum phale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras.</hi>
Magiſtracy is expenſive, and if you offer to hang theſe heavy
coſts and charges on weak nails, they wil quickly break, and then
you muſt take them down, and keep them in the City purſe.</p>
                     <p>Yet further, to their ſtrength and ability, it's requiſite that they
be fixed, wel driven and faſtned. Magiſtrates muſt be reſolved, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable,
and couragious, not ſickle, and inconſtant, turned about
with every wind: they muſt be wel ſetled in Religion, inflexible,
reſolute in a good cauſe. I have ſeen ſome nails and pegs ſcrewed
into the wall and ſo long as they are not ſtirred you may hang what
you wil on them: but if any man come with a ſtrong hand he may
eaſily wind and unſcrue them, and then they ſoon grow looſe, and
off ſlips all the burden they were entruſted withall: and ſo I have
ſeen many in authority, carry things very fair in Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth:
very right they are as long as they are ſuffer'd to ſtand
quietly: but alas if the hand of greatneſs do but touch them with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102714:14"/>
the violence of a threatning, or the ſtrength of fair promiſes; of
reward, honor, and preferment, it wil eaſily turn, and ſerue them
any way; and make them to betray Church and Common-wealth,
Religion and Liberty, and whatever is precious. Be ſure therefore
to chuſe nails ſteeled with Chriſtian reſolution: ſuch as wil ſtand
againſt all aſſaults, fixed, ſteady, and immoveable; like to that
<hi>Rom. in Fabritius,</hi> of whom it was ſaid, that one might as wel ſtay
the motion of the ſun in the firmament, as to put him out of his
way. Have your thoughts ever upon ſuch: make choice of ſtrong
nails: ſtout, and able for underſtanding, wiſdom, wit, ſtrength,
eſtate, courage, and reſolution, Able men.</p>
                     <p>2. You muſt provide bright and ſhining nails: not of baſe iron,
or wood,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 5. 9.</note> but of pure gold, wel burniſhed: Such, and only ſuch
would <hi>Solomon</hi> make uſe of in the Sanctuary. Ever chuſe ſuch as
ſhine and gliſter with piety and holineſs: men fearing God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Be wiſe ye Kings</hi> (ſaith David) <hi>be learned ye Judges of the

                        <note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 10. 11.</note> there's ſtrength and abilities required: but that's not all:
<hi>you muſt alſo ſerve the Lord with fear.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is nothing more deſtructive and dangerous to Church &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
then eminent abilitys unſanctified. You ſhal oft obſerve
great, ſtout, ruſty, rugged-iron nails, to rent, and tear, and fret,
and change the colour of whatſoever is hanged upon them: juſt ſo
wicked men of eminent parts, and great power do bear up a deal of
miſchief: and by their countenance and example do taint and ſtain,
and corrupt all the inferior people. As therefore <hi>David</hi> choſe
ſmooth ſtones to encounter the <hi>Philiſtin</hi> withall: So do you chuſe
ſmooth nails to ſtrike through the temples of <hi>Siſera:</hi> nails of pure
gold, filed from their ruſt and ruggedneſs; ſhining bright with pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
and holineſs: provide ſuch for the puniſhment of evil doers, and
faithfully to bear the affairs of the Church, City and Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>3. You muſt provide right, ſtraight; and ſound nails. Men of

                        </note> that is, juſt men; (ſo the Septuagint) Truth and juſtice

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102714:14"/>
juſtice, and put on judgment as a robe, and diadem.</hi> Job 29.
14.</p>
                     <p>Provide men of truth, Clear from all hypocriſy. There are a
company of guilded nails; fairly guilded over, but within ruſty,
and rotten: they are too-too many who are glorious in outward
profeſſion, in outward appearance, lovers of juſtice, truth and
godlineſs, but within they are ful of guile and deceipt, very hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.
Look wel about you, or elſe you may be couzen'd by the
outward appearance. Pick out right, ſtraight, and ſound nails:
true <hi>Nathaniels, Iſraelites</hi> indeed, ſuch as in whom is no guile.</p>
                     <p>4. You muſt look at nails elevated. The nails which ly ſcattered
on the ground are not in a fit poſture to bear burdens. No, No, but
only ſuch as are faſtned aloft in the top of the wal or pillar. Neither
are ſuch men fit for Magiſtracy whoſe thoughts lye groveling on
the baſe earth: who mind the world, and therefore muſt you chuſe
men <hi>hating Covetouſneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The covetous man for a gift wil wreſt judgment, reſpect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
ſel juſtice, bear up all vice, and puniſh innocence it ſelf. The
nail that's ſit to bear burdens muſt be elevated, the head and body
ſlanting upwards: a man fit to bear office, muſt have a mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
earth, a heart not greedy of filthy lucre: if the head of the
nail bend downward, the ſcales of juſtice wil never hang ſure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, but ſlip off immediatly.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore my beloved brethren! You that vote in electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
be nice, curious, circumſpect in the choice of nails; let them
be ſtrong, and able, let them have heads, and points, let them be
bright, and ſhining, let them be right, and ſtraight; and let them
be ſuch as have their heads, and hearts to heavenward. Amongſt
the <hi>Romans</hi> there was ſuperſtitious obſervation of the Nail. When
the Common-wealth was in danger, or oppreſt with great evils and
calamities, then did the <hi>Dictator</hi> faſten a great nail of iron, or
braſs in the wall of the Capitol with marvailous ſolemnity: And
the faſtning of ſuch a nail, was eſteemed a preſent remedy againſt
all miſchiefs, and a charm againſt the plague. And ſo conceited
they were of this way, that oftentime a <hi>Dictator</hi> was created:
<hi>Solius figendi clavi cauſa:</hi> only to knock in a nail, thereby to ſave
the City.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:102714:15"/>
What reaſons the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> had for this their cuſtom, or
what experience of the ſucceſs thereof; I cannot give an account;
but I cannot miſs of application. You ſee how many evils are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, how great our dangers: would you remove all theſe?
Would you have the Church and Kingdom, and City flouriſh again?
Then faſten good nails within your walls: chuſe, and eſtabliſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and godly Magiſtrates: that's a good, and ready way to free
us of all our plagues.</p>

                     <p>Some nayls are placed, <hi>in loco non fideli,</hi> in a rotten, hollow and

                     <p>There's a trick, <hi>clavum clavo pellere,</hi> to drive out one nayl with

                     <p>A good Magiſtracy is a ſign of Gods love and preſence. When a
man hath made choice of his habitation, in the houſe where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
to dwel; there he knocks up nails and pegs upon every wall,
and poſt, which may be for his uſe and convenience, upon which
he may hang things off hand, and alſo know where to have them
again: So doth the Lord alſo, in the place which he chuſeth for
his habitation;<note place="margin">Pſa. 123. 13. 14.</note> of which he ſaith, <hi>this is my reſt for ever, here
wil I dwel, for I have a delight therein:</hi> In that place wil he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten

                     <p>3. Finally, in the laſt place I am to direct my exhortation to all:
let every one in his place be a profitable nail. We have in a houſe
variety of nails, and pins, and pegs, ſome of braſs, ſome of iron,
ſome of wood, ſome bigger, ſome leſſer, ſome faſtend in a higher,
ſome in a lower place: upon one nail we hang one thing, upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
nail another thing, upon every one ſomething according to
their ſtrength and fitneſs: So let it be in Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth:
let every man; every woman, every perſon be a ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
nail in their place; let them bear ſome burden or other for
the benefit of the publique. Let Magiſtrates make laws, and ſee
them kept and put in execution; let them bear the burden of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Let Miniſters ſtudy, and preach, and pray, and walk
as a pattern to the flock, let them bear the burden of their office. Let
every man in his trade and vocation be induſtrious and faithful,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 28,</note> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
with his hands the thing that is good, that he may be able to
uphold his family, to relieve the poor, and to be beneficial to the
publique. <hi>Bear you one anothers burden,</hi> Saith St. Paul, <hi>and ſo
fulfil the Law of Chriſt:</hi> Gal. 6. 2.</p>
                     <p>Bear, every one of you, ſome of the Parliaments burden; ſome
of the Synods burden, ſome of your neighbours burdens, bear
ſomewhat or other for the uſe of Church and Common-wealth. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bear arms, if thou haſt a perſon to fight, or bear a purſe if
thou haſt an eſtate, or bear a burden of labour if thou haſt a
ſtrong body: ride, run, ſpare no pains, plot, and project, give
counſel if thou haſt a head for it. However bear a good heart in
thy breaſt to the cauſe of God, and thy Country: bear a good
tongue in thy head for the praiſe of God, and the honor of our
wrothys. And be ſure by thy inceſſan prayers, help bear up al
thats ready to fall.</p>

Doctrine, and general Application. And now it's time (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to my ordinary method) to return to the particulars. You
have had the harveſt, now for the gleanings: you have been at the
feaſt, now let's gather up the crums: you have had the ſubſtance
of the nail, let's ſearch for the very filings.</p>
                     <p>The particulars you may remember, were four.</p>
                     <p>1. The Maſter-worker, that faſtens the nail. <hi>I.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. The nail that's faſtned. <hi>Eliakim.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. The <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>4. The end, uſe, and benefit of this nail ſo faſtned.</p>
                     <p>Every one of theſe wil afford us ſome wholſom inſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore Wee'l caſt our eye more diligently upon them all,
and the Lord make all profitable,</p>
                     <p>1. And firſt for the principal Architect: who is it that faſtens
the nail?</p>
                     <p>Here the Doctrine is concerning the efficient cauſe of Magiſtracy.<note place="margin">Doctr.</note>
It is the Lord of hoſts.</p>
                     <p>God is the author of loveraignty, it is he that puls out, and puts
in what nails he pleaſeth.</p>
                     <p>By me Kings raign, ſaith the Lord, and Princes decree juſtice.</p>
                     <p>By me princes rule,<note place="margin">Prov. 8. 15. 16.</note> and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</p>
                     <p>He changeth the times, and the ſeaſons: he removeth Kings,
and ſetteth up Kings. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 21.</p>
                     <p>Nebuchadnczzar <hi>muſt know</hi> that the moſt high ruleth in the
Kingdoms of men, and giveth them to whomſoever he wil. <hi>Dan.</hi>
4. 25.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>gives us the propoſition fully:</hi> There is no power but of
God, the powers that be are ordained of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1.</p>
                     <p>Conſider this all you whom the Lord hath faſten'd in high places<note place="margin">Applic.</note>
of authority. Is it the Lord of hoſts hath made you rulers? Then
take heed what you do: for <hi>you judg not for man, but for the
Lord who is with you in the judgment.</hi> 2 Chron. 19. 6.</p>
                     <p>Your power is not arbitrary but delegate. Look therefore to
your Commiſſion, to the word and wil of God. Judg as thoſe
that muſt give an account unto the righteous God: who at the
laſt day wil judg all things over again. And in Miniſtring juſtice,
ever have this in your minds: We are nails to bear the burden
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102714:18"/>
of Authority: who faſten'd us here?</p>
                     <p>Again, let godly Magiſtrates (be they never ſo few in number,
meet they with never ſo much oppoſition) yet let them take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and courage, and go on boldly to do Gods work: to diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
ſin, to puniſh evil doers, to ſuppreſs Malignants, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the good, to advance the cauſe of God, and to further
the work of Reformation. Let them not fear the oppoſition, nor
the malice, nor the rage, nor the power of man. It is God that
hath exalted them, and faſtned them in their high places with his
own hand: and he wil preſerve them, ſo long as they faithfully
bear the burden which he hangs upon them. They ſhal ſtand ſure
in their places, and never be removed: for the Lord hath faſten'd
them, and ſhal for ever eſtabliſh them.</p>
                     <p>Finally, let me give a word of direction to all. Would you have?
Would you keep good and ſerviceable nails? Would you have able
and faithful Magiſtrates and Miniſters in your City, in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?
See then what courſe you muſt take: Go to the <hi>Maſter of
the aſſemblies,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ecclf. 12. 11.</note> it is he that faſtens theſe nails. Pray, pray, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
unto God the ſad condition of the Church and Common-wealth,
for want of good and able nails: how few there be of
ſuch, how thin they ſtand in the City-wall, how thin in the
Church-wall. How few godly Magiſtrates in a Country, how
many miles a man may travail, through how many Pariſhes, and
not ſee one good nail faſtned, not one ſound and painful preacher:
and be earneſt with God to pul, to pluck out, and to throw down
all rotten and uſeleſs nails: and to put, and faſten good, and able,
right, and ſtraight, ſubſtantial, and ſerviceable ones in their
room.</p>
                     <p>We have ſeen who faſtens the Nail;<note place="margin">2.</note> proceed we to the 2
Particular, and let's look upon the nail that's faſtned. What nail
is it? Or rather who is it? For it's a living nail. It is a man, and
a good man: <hi>Eliakim,</hi> that's his name: He was the ſervant of
the Lord, that's his goodneſs: And he it is that the Lord faſtens in
a ſure place.</p>
                     <p>And here the Doctrine wil teach us what kind of nails they be
which God faſtens:<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> namely good nails, and none elſe. God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſheth
only good men in high places of Authority. A baſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102714:18"/>
rotten nail may be driven into a wall, and ſtand a while, but not
long: The Lord plucks wicked men out of their places, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs
his faithful ſervants into their room. He puts down the
mighty, that is, the proud, and wicked great ones of the world:
<hi>he puts them down from their ſeats, and exalteth them of low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
the humble, and Godly ones.</hi> Luk. 1. 52.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Haman</hi> was promoted by the King,<note place="margin">Heſter 3. 1.</note> advanced as a nail into a
high place, his ſeat was above all the Princes; but he was a rotten
and ſcragged nail,<note place="margin">Heſter 7. 6.</note> tearing the people of God; 'twas <hi>wicked Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
But the Lord ſoon plucked him out of his ſeat, threw him
down, and faſten'd good <hi>Mordecai</hi> in his room.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hophni,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2 12. 34. 35.</note> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> the young Prieſts, they were ſons of
<hi>Belial,</hi> they were exceeding wicked, and knew not the Lord:
and what ſaith the Lord concerning them? They ſhal be depoſed
from their office of Prieſthood, in one day they ſhal dye both of
them. Yea both of them, and <hi>Eli</hi> their father, and pluck'd out
in one day.</p>
                     <p>And ſaith the Lord,<note place="margin">1 Sam 2 35.</note> I wil raiſe me up a faithful Prieſt, that
ſhal do according to that which is in mine heart, and in my mind:
and I wil build him a ſure houſe, and he ſhal walk before mine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
for ever.</p>
                     <p>Old <hi>Eli</hi> was pluck'd out as a ruſty nail,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 29. 22.</note> and <hi>Zadok</hi> annointed
high-priest in his room.</p>
                     <p>God wil eſtabliſh only good good men in their places.</p>
                     <p>This point muſt not paſs without ſome application, and it may
be various.</p>
                     <p>1. For our inſtruction we may obſerve what ſhal be the end of
good and evil Magiſtrates, and of all in eminent places: Princes
and Rulers, the great men of the earth: Prophets and miniſters of
the Goſpel.<note place="margin">Prov 2. 22. 23.</note> What ſhal their end be? <hi>Solomon</hi> wil tel you: <hi>Such
as walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
ſhal dwel in the land:</hi> they ſhal ſtand as a nail in a ſure place:
<hi>But the wicked,</hi> be they never ſo great, <hi>ſhal be cut of from the
earth, and the tranſgreſſors ſhal be rooted out off it.</hi> Yes, this is
an undoubted truth; the wicked though they be placed never ſo
high, and ſeem to ſtand ſo faſt that they can never be moved: yet
the Lord wil pluck them out at the laſt, and put better in their
room.</p>
                     <p>

In the eye of the world, who could be faſter rivetted in his high

Shebna:</hi> that is, to him that cunningly doth favour, and
cheriſh all parties!</p>
                     <p>I hinted you a while ago, that ſome thought <hi>Shebna</hi> to be the
High Prieſt: I have diſputed the point once<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I wil meddle with
it no more: but I am ſure he had the very tricks of our High-prieſts
now adayes. For (as I have it from good Authors) he kept in with
all ſides. Being favorite to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of <hi>Juda,</hi> he did ſeem to
favour the King, he did flatter, and fawne, and uſe all his skill, to
warm the Kings affection, and cheriſh his good opinion, and every
way to endear him. Alſo, as an Arch-traytor, moſt perfidious to his
good Maſter, he held fair correſpondency with <hi>Sennacherib</hi> King
of <hi>Aſſyria, Hezekiahs</hi> enemy: He was a Pentioner to the King of
<hi>Aſſyria,</hi> he was his Intelligencer, he held a ſecret league, and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy
with him; and was by compact engaged unto <hi>Sennacherib,</hi>
to betray the King his Maſter, and the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the
Kingdom of <hi>Juda</hi> into his hands whenſoever he came with his
mighty hoſt. And thus by his craft and policy, he thought to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
himſelfe againſt all events, come what would come; prevaile
who would prevaile, he would ſtand ſure: if <hi>Hezekiah</hi> prevailed
againſt <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> then <hi>Shebna</hi> was well enough, he was the
Kings favorite: if <hi>Sennacherib</hi> prevailed againſt <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> yet
<hi>Shebna</hi> would do well enough; for he was alſo the King of <hi>Aſſr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria's</hi>
ſervant, and did ſecretly make way for him to invade, and
conquer.</p>
                     <p>And now the proud ambitious Traytor growes to a height of
confidence: he thinks he ſtands as a nayl that cannot be ſtirred nor
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102714:19"/>
plucked out of his place. And in this preſumptuous confidence he
erects a ſtately monument for himſelf in <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> as you may
reade verſ. 16. He hews himſelf out a Sepulchre on high, and grave's
a habitation for himſelf in a rock: Hee concludes his owne ſafety:
that if <hi>Hezekiah</hi> proſper, he is his Favorite to his dying day: if <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib</hi>
conquer, he ſhal be his Deputy, or Viceroy as long as he
lives. And at laſt, that he ſhal dye with honour at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and
all his pomp follow him, and his name be famous to all generations;
being written in marble, and braſſe upon his Sepulchre. Thus, thus,
ſilly man, he flatters himſelf. But now obſerve the end. As it was
with proud <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 31.</note> glorying in his great <hi>Babel,</hi> while
the word was in his mouth, the Voice fell from heaven, ſaying!
<hi>The Kingdom is departed from thee:</hi> So commeth the word of the
Lord to <hi>Shebna;</hi>

                        <hi>What haſt thou here? and whom haſt thou here?</hi>
Why doſt thou think thy ſelf faſtened here as a nayl that cannot be
removed? But that thou ſhalt live here, and dye here, and lay thy
bones here? Behold the Lord will pluck thee out; and carry thee
away with a mighty captivity. He will ſurely violently turn, and
toſſe thee like a ball into a large country, there ſhalt thou dye, and
there the chariots of thy glory, ſhall be the ſhame of thy Lords
houſe. And there's an end of <hi>Shebna!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A paralel example we have of our own; which becauſe it doth
ſo aptly agree with the former, I will inſert. It is of Sir <hi>Thomas
More,</hi> who bare the ſame office under the King of <hi>England,</hi> that
<hi>Shebna</hi> did under the King of <hi>Judah;</hi> he was <hi>Lord Chancellour</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> under <hi>Henry</hi> the eight; he was a bitter enemy of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
and perſecuted the godly profeſſors of it with fire and ſword,
and thought thereby to get him a name; and needs muſt he have a
monument of his cruelty and impiety. He therefore takes care, to
have a ſumptuous, and magnificent Sepulchre erected; and upon it
written Encomiaſtiques, the high praiſes of his vertue. He made
his own Epitaph, and ſent it to <hi>Baſil,</hi> unto <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> that he might
get it curiouſly engraven. He ſent alſo with it a ſtately ambling, or
paſing horſe, unto <hi>Eraſmus</hi> for his reward; that he might be ſo
much the more carefull about the work. So greedy was he of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and fame. Amongſt the reſt of his praiſes, this was the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous;
and to be written in great letters; <hi>Lutheranorum profliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>Then I beſeech you! See upon whom you may moſt ſafely depend.</p>
                     <p>We that are ſubjects, are as a company of infirm <hi>veſſels:</hi> we
muſt all hang upon ſome nail or other, or elſe we are loſt upon the
ground. Now our wiſdom wil be to rely on ſure, and ſound nails.</p>
                     <p>But you wil ſay perhaps, how may we know the beſt nails?</p>
                     <p>I wil tel you, there are now in the Kingdom two ſorts of nails:
Court-nails, and Parliament-nails. Both are exalted very high:
now tel me which wil you chuſe to depend upon?</p>
                     <p>Me thinks I hear ſome reply: what nail ſhould we depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but that which the Lord hath faſten'd? And is not the King
that nail? Hath not God ſet him upon the throne? And muſt I
not go along with him in every thing?</p>
                     <p>Give me leave to anſwer. We do acknowledg with all duty,
and obedience: that the King is the higheſt Nail, that he is a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Nail, that he is a nail choſen of God, and anointed: And the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102714:20"/>
deſire of our hearts is that the Lord would eſtabliſh his throne, and
faſten him ſo ſure that he may never be removed.</p>
                     <p>But that which makes our hearts ſad; it's this, that he is not, <hi>in
loco fideli,</hi> in a faithful place: That wall that's made up of Papiſts,
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels, Delinquents, Malignants, and wicked Counſellors,
muſt needs be a rotten wall; and can a nial ſtand ſure in ſuch a place?</p>
                     <p>The Parliament is a ſound wall, made up of worthy <hi>Eliakims,</hi>
loyal Subjects, ſervants of the Lord, and faithful Patriots.</p>
                     <p>Now the Lord bring the King into the midſt of his Parliament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
then ſhould he be indeed <hi>in loco fideli,</hi> and we might ſafely
hang upon him.</p>
                     <p>But in the mean time, his power and Authority is with his great
Counſel. It is an undoubted Parliament by the Kings own act.
But it cannot be a true Parliament without a King. Why then, he
is with them vertually, thou he be not perſonally. The Parliament
is all but one great nail. The King is the head, the houſes are the
body; if you take the head off the nail, what can hang ſafely on it?
Therefore now I can eaſily ſhew you what nail to hang on: I thus
deſcribe it to you. <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Parliament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are two mighty Armys abroad, one againſt the other. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of us muſt depend upon one of thoſe. We muſt take part
with one againſt the other. In the name of God, ſee that you chuſe
the right nail. That's the nail that God faſtens, upon that you may
ſafely depend.</p>
                     <p>It is the extream folly of men, that they wil all chuſe to hang up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the great nail, and the leſſer nail they dare not truſt to. They'l
joyn with the moſt numerous Army, with the greateſt power.</p>
                     <p>Who would not have hanged upon <hi>Shebna</hi> (that had looked

                     <p>Shebna <hi>was a</hi> Vapouring Cavalier; Eliakim <hi>ſure, a deſpiſed</hi>

                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Shebna</hi> a great Polititian, held fair correſpondence with forraign

Yet you ſee he was the wiſeſt man, and in the ſafeſt condition

                     </p>
                     <p>I wil give it you in a word. Look impartially: and mark, not
which is the biggeſt, but which is the righteſt and ſtraighteſt nail,
look upon that ſide where you ſee moſt of God: moſt zeal, moſt
devotion, moſt piety; and joyn with them.</p>

and the <hi>Divil,</hi> and all the Malignant crew knock it, and hang the

                     <p>But on the other ſide, if you joyn with Idolaters Blaſphemers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched

rotten nail, a nail that God hath never faſtned; and though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
never ſo great, yet it wil deceive you: God wil certainly pluck
it out, and then there is nothing but certain ruin to be expected: if
the nail break, all that ever hangs on it falls down, and it is broken,
and loſt. For a cloſe of this, I ſhal paſs a doom upon all ſuch rotten
nails, and upon all that hang upon them. Even the ſentence upon

                     <p>The fourth and laſt particular now preſents it ſelf to your view,
<hi>viz.</hi> The end, and uſe of this nayl: <hi>Erit in ſolium gloriae.</hi> He ſhal
be for a glorious throne to his Fathers houſe.]</p>
                     <p>And concerning this, many things might be ſpoken: but becauſe
I have held you too long already, I ſhall only commend unto you, in
a word this Obſervation: To what end we are faſtened in our
places,</p>
                     <p>Let Magiſtrates, Miniſters, and every one here preſent, duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
wherefore they ſerve, namely, to bear burdens, for the honour
of God, and for the glory of their Countrie and Citie, and fathers
houſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Joſeph</hi> made his fathers houſe glorious, he enriched it with the
wealth, with the treaſures of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and made it famous, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
through all the world, as it is to this day.</p>
                     <p>Our bleſſed Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> (who is the <hi>Nayl</hi> ſpoken of
<hi>Zach.</hi> 10. 4.) He is the glory of his fathers houſe, even of the people
<hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſpeak firſt to the chief Magiſtrate, and then to every one in his
place. Know that you ought not to be for your baſe private ends,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102714:23"/>
for your own honour, and wealth; but you muſt be men of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
ſpirits: you muſt be for the good, and for the glory of your
Citie, and your Countrie: of the Church and Common-wealth.</p>
                     <p>You muſt endevour the publique good before your own. You
muſt be content to bear any load of pains, or charge, to procure
the wealth and proſperity of the Kingdom, that the reformation
may be perfected, true Religion eſtabliſhed, Popery, ſuperſtition,
and the proud tyrannicall <hi>Hierarchy</hi> may be utterly extirpated; the
rights and priviledges of <hi>Parliement,</hi> and the liberties of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
preſerved: That the Kings perſon, and authority in the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of true Religion may be defended: that the peace of the
Kingdoms may be continued; that delinquents may be brought to
condigne puniſhment, that <hi>England</hi> may be made a ſure place, a
happie Nation, a famous Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Know that you are ſet for a
throne of glory: Be all of you for the honour of your Citie, for the
glory of <hi>Norwich.</hi> Make it famous, and happie this year. Mind not
your own things, but the publique benefit. The deviſe of <hi>Alphonſus
King of Arragon,</hi> was this: A Pellican pecking her breſt, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out blood wherewith to feed her young: the word <hi>Pro lege, &amp;
pro grege.</hi> So ſhould every good Magiſtrate, not count his blood
dear, for the welfare of the people.</p>
                     <p>The Motto of <hi>Aelius Adrianus</hi> the Emperour was, <hi>Non mihi
ſed populo.</hi> A man ſet in authority, ſhould not be for himſelf, for his
own profit, or eaſe, but all for advancing the common good.</p>
                     <p>Abate of your exceſſe; make leſſe and fewer feaſts, and do more
good for the publique: Lay leſſe upon your backs, and do more for
the publique. I know what people are ready to ſay for themſelves;
That if Mayors, and Sheriffes ſhall not make as great feaſts at Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and other times, as others before them, they ſhould be diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and talked on all the Town over; they ſhould be counted co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,
and miſerable, and people would ſay they knew not what
doth belong to their office, and it would be a diſhonour to the
Citie.</p>
                     <p>Alas, alas, my beloved! Is it for the honour of your Citie to have
<hi>Sodoms</hi> Character? <hi>That pride, fulneſſe of bread, and abundance of
idleneſſe is in her?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Gentlemen! if any ſhall jeer you for not feaſting as your prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours,
as if you knew not what belongs to your places: Anſwer
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102714:24"/>
them as once <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> did: who being at a ſumptuons feaſt,
and not ſinging with the reſt of the jovial company, and meeting
with ſome checks for his ſilence, he ſaid unto them. I confeſs I
have not learned to ſing to the pipe at feaſts, but I have learned
<hi>rempublicam ex parva magnam facere:</hi> to raiſe a Common-wealth
from a poor eſtate, to a flouriſhing condition: So do you
anſwer all the world: You have not learned to ſquander away vaſt
ſums of money in rich clothing, ſumptuous, and exceſſive feaſts:
but you have learned to lay out your money better, and to part
with your eſtate freely, even to the utmoſt farthing for the publick
ſafety and good.</p>
                     <p>I beſeech you be for a throne of glory; be all for the honor of
your City and Country.</p>
                     <p>Uſually you ſhal hear men boaſt much of their Country, City,
Progenitors: and they brag that they were born in ſuch a famous

                  <p>Theſe are the parts and particulars of the text. I wil not fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them preſently; I ſhal lay them aſide a while, and according to
my plain and uſual way, I wil diſpatch 3. things.</p>
                  <p>1. I wil ſpeak ſomething of the ſence, and meaning of the text.</p>
                  <p>2. I wil give you the ſum and ſubſtance of all in one general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition

ſuch obſervations, and inſtructions as may be of further uſe: and

                  <p>1. And firſt I am to expound and open the text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As for the Wheels</hi>] When <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was among the Captives,
in the Land of the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> by the River <hi>Chebar,</hi> walking up
and down by the waters of <hi>Babylon;</hi> he ſaw broad-waking, a
glorious viſion, wherein the Lord ſhewed to him the things which
were ſhortly after to come to paſs.</p>
                  <p>And as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dreams when he was aſleep,<note place="margin">Gen. 41. 32.</note> ſo <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
when he was awake, were doubled, becauſe the thing was
eſtabliſhed, and God haſted to perform it.</p>
                  <p>He firſt ſees the Viſion by the River <hi>Chebar.</hi> Chap. 1.</p>
                  <p>He ſees it again, with ſome conſiderable alterations, additions,
and amplifications in this 10. Chapter.</p>
                  <p>To repreſent and ſet before your eyes the whole Viſion, and
exactly to deſcribe every part, every apparition, every wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and dreadful ſight which our Prophet beheld, would take up
more time, and require more skil then falls to my ſhare. I ſhal
therefore only point to a few of the moſt general, and moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
things, which may ſerve to give ſome light to the text,
and to let in the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>To our purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>He ſaw] <hi>in the firmament which was clear as the terrible chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">v. 1.</note>
viz. <hi>above the ſtarry heavens, he ſaw</hi> a glorious throne as it
were a Saphire-ſtone, and upon the throne was the likeneſs as the
appearance of a man: the ſon of God ſate above it. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 26.</p>
                  <p>Under his feet there were four living creatures, ſo they were
called in his firſt viſion. Chap. 1. 5. here in this 10. is an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
they are called <hi>Cherubins:</hi> they had faces, wings, hands,
and feet.</p>
                  <p>Below, by the feet of theſe <hi>Cherubins</hi> were wheels: four wheels
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102714:29"/>
in all, according to the number of the living creatures. Theſe
wheels were dreadful to behold by reaſon of their wonderful great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
the height of their rings, the ſwiftneſs of their motion, the
brightneſs of their colour, and the multitude of their eyes. This
was the viſion, but what was the ſignification? That's the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
queſtion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In general, this was to ſet forth</hi> the appearance of the likeneſs of
the glory of the Lord.<note place="margin">c. r. 28.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But more particularly: The man ſitting above upon the throne,
is <hi>the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

which are immediatly under the Command of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But the wheels at the feet of the Cherubins, what are they?</p>
                  <p>A wheel is <hi>inſtrumentum volubile;</hi> a round turning inſtrument:
there are divers ſorts of wheels, chariot-wheels, clock-wheels, bel-wheels,
mil-wheels, and many others which perhaps we ſhal meet
withal by and by. The wheels that appeared to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> are thought
to be <hi>chariot-wheels.</hi> The general: conceipt is, that he ſaw a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
chariot: and that the living creatures were the drawers, and
movers, and the man on the throne the guider of it: and the word
<hi>Synechdochical, rota pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

                        </gap>u,</hi> the wheel for the whole Chariot.</p>
                  <p>The wheel is an inſtrument of very great and frequent uſe. Many
works are done by the turning of the wheel. The Chariot, Coach,
and Cart are carried on their way by wheels.<note place="margin">Jer. 18. 3.</note> The husbandman
plows, and threſheth, and grindeth beats out his corn with wheels.
The huſwife ſpins her thrid upon the wheel:<note place="margin">Eſa. 28. 27. 28.</note> and the work of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
(as we ſhal hear more afterward) is done by the wheel: <hi>A
wiſe King ſcattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over
them.</hi> Prov. 20. 26.</p>
                  <p>And by this time it is not hard to find out what is meant by the
wheels; namely, all inſtruments, and ſecond cauſes by which God
uſeth to work in the diſpenſation of his providence.</p>
                  <p>The glorious Angels firſt, even they themſelves are Gods great
wheels. Then the round celeſtial orbs, and lights which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
wheeling about, next the lower world, the elements, and
all creatures in the aire, earth, and wide ſea.</p>
                  <p>But eſpecially,<note place="margin">Lavat. in loci</note> we are to underſtand by the wheels reaſonable
creatures; as Kingdoms, Common-wealths, Citys, Churches;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102714:30"/>
which are ſocieties of men; Kings, Princes, Magiſtrates, chief Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
Armies, Miniſters, preachers of the Goſpel, and all people in
their ſeveral places: who ever hath any employment under God
is a wheel in the chariot of his providence: Theſe are the wheels.
Now <hi>it was cryed unto them</hi>] From the throne above. The Lord
<hi>Jehovah,</hi> that ſate aloft upon the glorious throne: he</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cryed</hi>] that is, aloud, earneſtly, with a mighty voice he called
to them.</p>

                     </gap> Oh Wheel! This
is demonſtrative, and points to ſome ſpecial wheel. Though the
voice be generally cryed to all the wheels, to every creature in heaven
and earth: as if the ſon of God ſhould ſay: O World!</p>
                  <p>Yet here we muſt conceive that it is directed in an eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and her wheels; to the princes, prieſts, and
Commons which were left there, and were not carried into <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
with the reſt of the Captives. For this viſion was ſhew'd to
the Prophet for <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> ſake: to ſignify to him what was ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

to all the wheels, and crys, <hi>O Wheel!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a word of Authority and Command, by which the Lord
either drives the wheels on, excites them to do ſomething: <hi>imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which here are not expreſſed. Or elſe it's a word of countermand,
and he checks them for ſome irregular motions: and it is as if the
ſon of God ſhould ſay, O Wheell ſtop, turn your courſe the right
way: obey. In a word, this is the word of Gods power, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the world, and all the creatures in it, all ſecond cauſes, and all
perſons are over-awed, and their motions determined.</p>
                  <p>You have the ſence of the text: next il'e give you the general doctrin.</p>
                  <p>It is concerning the general, and particular providence of God:
The voice of him that ſits on the throne, commands, and over-aws
all the wheels. So univerſal, and ſo particular is the providence of
God, that it governs and rules all things in heaven and earth. The
powerful providence of God doth diſpoſe all ſecond cauſes as he
pleaſeth, and orders all creatures in the world, and all motions in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102714:30"/>
the world according to the counſell of his own will: if the Lord do
but cry, <hi>O wheel!</hi> all the wheels are at his beck, and turn as he bids
them. There's not the leaſt motion of a Chariot wheel, but the Lord
appoints it.<note place="margin">Exod 14 25.</note> This appears by <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Chariot wheels, <hi>The Lord
took off their Chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily:</hi> He
had ſaid before, <hi>O wheel!</hi> carry <hi>Pharaoh</hi> into the midſt of the Sea:
now he gives them a check, and cry's to them; <hi>O wheel!</hi> fly off
from your axletrees; and as the word comes from God, ſo do the
wheels move and turn.</p>
                  <p>Behold the power of God's word, and how his voyce commands
all things <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 29. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. The voice of the Lord commands it to
thunder, or not to thunder: the voice of the Lord commandeth
the waters to ebbe, or flow, to be rugged, or calme; <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. The
voice of the Lord commands the Cedars, he bids them grow, and
they come up; again, he ſpeaks but to them, and they are broken
down; alſo when he pleaſeth he makes them skip like a Calfe, or
like a young Unicorn. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. The voice of the Lord commands
the fire; he ſayes to the watry cloud, divide; and it breaks in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and the lightning darts forth, and ſcattereth it ſelf through-out
our <hi>Haemisphere</hi> in the twinkling of an eye. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. and 8. The
voice of the Lord commands <hi>Lebanon</hi> and <hi>Cadeſh;</hi> at his word the
mountains daunce, and the wilderneſſe tremble. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. The voice of
the Lord commands the wild beaſts of the forreſts; he ſpeaks to the
Hinds, and they Calve: again he ſayes the word, and they are barren.
In the Forreſt a leaf falls not from a tree, the woods are not made
bare without his word. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>The Lord ſits upon the floud, yea,
the Lord ſitteth King for ever:</hi> his voice commands the ſea; he ſaith
to it,<note place="margin">Job 38. 11.</note> hitherto ſhalt thou come, and no further, and here ſhalt thou
ſtop thy proud waves: Yea, the voice of the Lord commands the

<hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 24.</p>
                  <p>But what may be the reaſon,<note place="margin">Reaſon.</note> or ground of this? That the voice
of the Lord ſhould thus command, and over-aw all the wheel's?
Yes good reaſon: What hand ſhould turn the wheel, but the ſame
that made it? By the voice of the Lord all creatures were made: By
<hi>the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the hoſt of
them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 6. He did but ſay, <hi>Let there be light,</hi> and <hi>there
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102714:31"/>
was light:</hi> He did but ſay, Let there be a firmament, let there be
ſea, and dry land, let there be graſſe, and trees in the earth, and
lights in the heaven, and fiſhes in the ſea; and immediatly it was
done, it was ſo.</p>
                  <p>Yet further, his voice did not only command theſe wheels to be
made; the ſame word alſo preſerves them, maintains them in being.
<hi>He upholds all things by the word of his power,</hi> Hebr. 1. 3.</p>
                  <p>God made all creatures, therefore of right he may diſpoſe of
them, and order all their motions as he pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p>He is the great <hi>Atlas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Caelifer Atlas.</note> bears up heaven and earth, and all things
upon the ſtrong ſhoulders of his providence: and therefore he hath
power to move all things as he liſteth. He that bears a burden upon
his back may carry it whither he will. The cunning Artificer who
makes a clock, or curious pocket-watch; he alſo diſpoſeth, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
every wheel, in what place it ſhall be, what motion it ſhall
have, how long it ſhall go: So the Almighty, and infinitely wiſe
God, he made the wheel's, and turns the wheels: he made the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
and the leaſt creatures, and he cauſeth, and over-ruleth the
greateſt, and the leaſt motions.</p>
                  <p>To give you the whole doctrine in one Embleme.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was an Aenigmaticall Prophet; and me thinks he gives us
(that which was firſt ſhewed to him in a viſion) the moſt elegant,
and ſignificant <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> of Divine providence that can be
found out in the whole world:<note place="margin">Cap. 1. &amp; 10.</note> it is a Chariot.</p>
                  <p>A Chariot commonly is drawn by four horſes: by them at their
feet are four wheels; above, a ſeat wherein the man ſits who guides
the engin; he with his reins and whip, and voice commands the
beaſts, the wheels, the whole Chariot, and all things in it, and they are
moved, and turned as he pleaſeth. Such is the <hi>Chariot</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi>
God ſits in the ſeat, even above in heaven upon his glorious Throne,
and by his word and power commands, guides, and moves all infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
things.</p>
                  <p>Next under God are the living creatures, the Angels they are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring
ſpirits immediatly moved by him that ſits upon the Throne.</p>
                  <p>The Angels they move the wheels: God governs inferiour things
by the miniſtry of Angels: There are four living creatures, and four
faces, and foure wheels, to repreſent the foure corners of the
earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:102714:31"/>
The ſumme of all, is this in one word: The providence of God
doth rule, and commaud, in all the four quarters of the world: God
hath wheels every where, and he turns them all by his word of
command; <hi>O wheel!</hi> You have the generall doctrine.</p>
                  <p>To make ſome uſe of it. And here I might be large, and apply it
variouſly.</p>
                  <p>I might, firſt, for our inſtruction, gather this Corollary; That
there is no <hi>Contingency</hi> in the world; nothing fals out by chance:
Not a wheel ſtirs but it's moved by Gods hand:<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 29, 30</note> Not a Sparrow
fals to the ground, nor a haire from our heads without your Father:
Not an <hi>ax-head</hi> flies off from the helve, but it's thrown, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by God's hand.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, in regard of us, and in relation to ſecond cauſes, things
may ſeem chanceable, and contingent; becauſe ſomething fals out
that was not like to happen at all, or elſe the thing was like to fall
out quite otherwiſe then it doth, we being ignorant of the cauſes
of ſuch caſualties.</p>
                  <p>But in regard of God nothing is contingent: he is the firſt, and
ſupream cauſe, the univerſall proviſor, and moderator; ſitting on
his Throne as a Judge, and a King; taking notice, and taking care of
the leaſt things,<note place="margin">Plenus negotii Deus.</note> of the ſmalleſt wheels in the Chariot: in reſpect of
him,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 11.</note> all things are neceſſary: He worketh all things <hi>according to
the counſell of his will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet again, I might apply it by way of reprehenſion, and give a
check to the heatheniſh language of many Chriſtians, that ſpeak
<hi>Luck</hi> and <hi>Chance</hi> as familiarly as Heathens uſe to do, and attribute
all things to <hi>Fortune.</hi> This was my fortune, this was my luck. What
are theſe but Atheiſts, and ſuch as deny Providence? <hi>The iniquity
of the houſe of Iſrael is exceeding great, and the City full of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe,</hi>
ſaith the Lord, <hi>becauſe they ſay the Lord hath forſaken
the earth, and the Lord ſeeth not:</hi> The eye of his providence is
not abroad, the wheels move by chance. Oh that ſuch would be
humbled for their ſin. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> writ <hi>Retractations,</hi> and the very
firſt thing he corrects in himſelf, and bewail's, is, that ever he did
uſe the word <hi>Chance,</hi> or the name of <hi>Fortune.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I let paſs theſe: And I wil apply the doctrine only as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> teacheth me, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. <hi>Whatſoever things were written
were written for our learning that we through patience, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

to patience. Is every wheel turned by the voice of the ſon of God?
No motion but by his appointment? Learn then willing ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and cheerful contentation in all conditions. What? do not the
wheels move to thy liking? Art thou diſpleaſed at the motion of
the King? Or at the motion of the Parliament? or at the motion
of the Army? (thoſe are the <hi>three great wheels</hi> of the Kingdom)
Beſtil: they move as God bids them! it was ſaid unto them in
my hearing, <hi>O Wheel!</hi> The Kings heart, the Parliaments heart, the
Armies heart are all in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water,
and he turns them whetherſoever he wil. <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 1. Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

thy children, thy deareſt friends, thou wouldeſt have theſe
ſweetly to move with thee in a perpetual communion, but God
turns them another way, they roul out of thy houſe and ſociety
into the grave; and for this thou doſt mourn, and art diſcontented.
As for the world, thou would'ſt have it run in upon thee upon
wheels: but God turns it another way, and it runs away from thee
upon wheels: yea faſter, it flies away: Riches certainly make

tongues of the world run upon wheels of fire, and clamour againſt

and doſt not conſider that the voice of the Lord over-rules, and

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe. 2.</note> this may be applyed for the comfort of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
for the conſolation of the Church and people of God, and
that many ways.</p>
                  <p>1. In the times of confuſion, as it is with us this day: The <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot-wheels</hi>
of our Kingdom move ſtrangely and dreadfully; how
are they hurried up and down, backward and forward, hither and
thither! and we are all in a maze, we know not what to think of
things, nor what to do, nor whether to turn us, all is like to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown
and broken, and turned topſy-turvy. Truly we can ſee
nothing by the wheeling of things, but ruin of all: of Religion,
and Laws, and utter deſolation of the whole Land. But here's our
comfort: it's not a young raſh <hi>Phaeton</hi> that ſits in the coach-box,
who wants both skil, and power to guide his fathers fiery ſteeds:
No, No, it's the Ancient of days that ſits in the ſeat of glory, he
commands the living creatures to draw the wheels which way he
pleaſeth, and that by his only word: and after all the wheelings,
and crooked turnings of his providence, he knows the way to bring
about a happy peace, and ſettlement in this Church and Kingdom:
which the Lord of his mercy grant. <hi>O thou ſon of God that ſitteſt
between the Cherubins, drive on, drive on by thy wiſdom and
power, to thine own glory and the comfort of thy poor dejected
people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Again, doth the voice of the Lord command all wheels? This
then may comfort the Church and people of God againſt all potent
enemys. Indeed the enemys of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> are commonly many
and mighty, ſuch as were the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> theſe
were the great, high, and terrible wheels which God was now
bringing over <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to break it in pieces: they were now co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102714:33"/>
upon the City, the ratling of the wheels was heard, and they
could not but come; for it was cryed unto them from the Lord,
<hi>O Wheel!</hi> come and execute the fury of my wrath upon <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
Now the ſame powerful voice can give the wheels a check,
and call them back again: this is the Churches comfort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saul</hi> purſued after <hi>David</hi> in the wilderneſs of <hi>Maon:</hi> he and
his numerous Army turned upon him as a dreadful wheel, and
wheeled about the mountain to have cruſhed him in pieces: but
when he was in his ſwifteſt motion, it was cryed unto him from
the Lord: <hi>O Wheel! O Saul!</hi> come back. There came a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
unto <hi>Saul,</hi> ſaying; haſte thee, and come, for the <hi>Philiſtins</hi>
have invaded the Land: So <hi>Saul</hi> returned from purſuing after <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi>
here the wheel was drawn off. Let the wheels run on never
ſo furiouſly; if God do but cry to them, they muſt come back: if
he cry to the wind peace! it ceaſeth; and if he ſay to the raging ſea,
be ſtil! there's preſently a great calm: <hi>Marc.</hi> 4. 39. It is not hard
for him to curb, and call in his creatures. <hi>Saul</hi> was a bloody per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor,
a reſtleſs wheel, running over the faithful ſervants of
God: <hi>Act.</hi> 9. but <hi>v.</hi> 4. he had a check, it was cryed unto him
from the ſon of God: <hi>Saul, Saul!</hi> why perſecuteſt thou me?
You have ſeen Princes, Prelates, Potentates moving fiercely againſt
the Church, but the Lord in our hearing and ſight hath given them
a check, and cryed unto them, <hi>O Wheel!</hi> go no further, and they
have ſtood ſtil, or gone back. The wheels come not towards us by
blind chance, but upon Gods call, they move not a hairs breadth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then God bids them, and when hepleaſeth he calls them back by
the word of his mouth: this is the Churches comfort.</p>
                  <p>3. And yet here's a further comfort to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Doth the
voice of the Lord command all wheels? Then let not the Church,
and people of God be troubled when they are at a low ebb; when
their dangers are great, their enemies many and mighty, and all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
fails and there's none to help them: when they are without all
ſtrength, let them not diſpair: God ſits upon the throne, and
commands the wheels, he can call in help from unexpected places.
In the 2. book of the <hi>Kings,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Kings 6.</note> chap. the 6. God calls for a great
wheel, even <hi>Benhadad King of Syria,</hi> with his mighty hoſt to
break <hi>Samaria;</hi> and <hi>Samaria</hi> was brought into great ſtraits, a
potent enemy without, and a grievous famine within, and no help
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102714:33"/>
appeared,<note place="margin">2 Kings 7. 6.</note> all ſeemed deſperate: but Chap. 7. upon the prophets
interceſſion (as I conceive) the Lord called in wheels to their
help; on earth all help failed, therefore the Lord relieves them from
above: for he made the hoſt of the <hi>Syrians</hi> to hear a noiſe in the aire
of <hi>Chariot wheels,</hi> and a noiſe of horſes, even the noiſe of a great
hoſt; and theſe imaginary wheels in the heaven, which the voice of
God called in to the reſcue of <hi>Samaria,</hi> diſcomfited the <hi>Syrians,</hi>
put them all to flight, they ran away as faſt as they could: and
now there is plenty, peace, and joy in the City.</p>
                  <p>Thus the mighty <hi>Jehovah</hi> that ſits above upon the throne, can
bring order into the Church out of confuſion; he can make the
moſt formidable enemies of the Church to go back, yea to fall
backwards; he can call in help to his Church when they are at their
wits end, and all by the word of his mouth. Here is <hi>Jeruſalems</hi>
comfort. I have done with the general Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Now in the 3. place I return to the parts of my text, to handle
them: I purpoſe to ſearch, and examine every particular, and I

                        <hi>O Wheel!</hi> in the ſingular number, mark that. The prophet
ſpeaks in the plural, as of many: As for the wheels, ſays he; but

wheels, though they be many and their motions different, yea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
yet all move to one and the ſame end, they all joyn as one in
bringing about Gods work. In mans eye there are many, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
company of wheels, but God accounts of them all, but
as of one great engine to bring to paſs his Counſel and decrees.
Look up to the glorious heavens rouling over your heads. The <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
mobile,</hi> the firſt moveable, or firſt mover, turns continually
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102714:34"/>
from Eaſt to Weſt in 24. hours upon the poles of the world: the
other inferior orbs, as ſo many croſs wheels turn quite contrary from
Weſt to Eaſt upon the poles of the <hi>Zodiak,</hi> and finiſh their circle
in different ſpaces of time: yet all theſe in reſpect of God, put the
aire, and the bottles of rain, and the earth, and all to them, are but
as one great wheel to do his work. See it plain in the 2. of <hi>Hoſea</hi>
v. 21. <hi>I wil hear,</hi> ſaith the Lord. <hi>I wil hear the heavens, and
they ſhal hear the earth; and the earth ſhal hear the corn, and
the wine, and the oyle, and they ſhal hear</hi> Jezreel. Here you ſee
are many wheels, many ſecond cauſes, or means ſubordinate one
to another, as it were a wheel in a wheel: but all joyn as one
wheel to do Gods work; <hi>viz.</hi> to feed, and ſuſtein his <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
The Lord of hoſts hath abundunce of Souldiers under him, yet all
but one great Army whereby he gets the victory. In a clock you
ſee many wheels, ſome greater, ſome leſſer; ſome move one way,
ſome the quite contrary way, ſome flower, ſome quicker, yet they
are all one engine, ſerving for one and the ſame end, <hi>viz.</hi> to count
the time, and point at the hours. There's nothing more plain.</p>
                     <p>Let us make ſome Uſe of this;<note place="margin">
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> and learn how to judg rightly of
Gods admirable providence. You muſt not take the work in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
nor ſix your eye too much upon ſome one ſpecial wheel, but
you muſt take all together; if you ſever the wheels, and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſome particular diſpenſations, you wil think the wheels move
ſtrangely.</p>
                     <p>Conſider <hi>Joſeph,</hi> he was made as a wheel; and if you mind on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſome particular turnings, you wil think he was turned ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
he was turned into the ditch, into a harlots houſe, into the
priſon; and yet the beſt of all the brethren: other wheels alſo
moved diſorderly about him: The <hi>Iſmaelites</hi> were moved by
covetouſneſs; his brethren moved by envy, his Mris. turned by
luſt: ſtrange ſpectacles, to look upon them ſeverally: but now
mark the whole work of Gods providence, and you ſhal ſee it
good and comely, by the turning of theſe wheels, he brings about
<hi>Joſephs</hi> advancement, and <hi>Iſraels</hi> preſervation.</p>
                     <p>How many wheels, and contrary motions were there about the
paſſion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt!</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> were moved with envy, if you
look no further, that's a ſtrange ſight: <hi>Judas</hi> was moved with
covetouſneſs, if you look no further that's a ſtrange ſight: <hi>Pilate</hi>
                        <pb n="69" facs="tcp:102714:34"/>
was moved with popular air, and that's a ſtrange ſight: <hi>Chriſt</hi> was
pierced, and by wicked hands crucified and ſlain; and if you look
upon that alone, oh! it's a prodigious, and diſmall ſight: but take
all the work of God's providence together, and you will behold it
beautifull and glorious: by all theſe wheel's, the Lord works the
redemption of man, the ſalvation of his Church, the deſtruction of
death and hell, the conqueſt of the Devill, and the exaltation of his
Son, and the glorification of his Saints. When you ſee <hi>Tyrants</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile,
and domineer, and exerciſe ſavage cruelty: When you ſee
bloody <hi>Maſſacres</hi> of God's dear people, holy Martyrs go to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
ſlakes, and flames; when you ſee the Prophets, and Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
of the Lord ſlighted, contemn'd, ſilenced: If you look no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
theſe things will ſeem very ſad, and amazing: but take all the
whole work of God's providence together; and you ſhall ſee it's
wiſe and good: The Church is ſowen with the Martyrs blood, and
made fruitfull: The deſtruction of the Churches enemies is ripened,
the glory of the Saints haſtned, and in all God is glorified. Conſider

Kings to draw his golden Chariot; which they did patiently, becauſe
they could not avoid it. One of the four kings that drew, caſt his
eye continually upon the Chariot wheel; and being demanded the
reaſon by <hi>Seſoſtris,</hi> he made anſwer; I ſee in this wheel the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability
of all worldly things. That part of the wheel which is
neereſt heaven is preſently upon the earth. This made ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
in <hi>Seſoſtris,</hi> that he would never afterwards ſuffer his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
to be drawn by Kings, nor yet by men, but carryed himſelf
more humbly and gently. The application is eaſy, as I ſaid at firſt,
and therefore I leave it to you: I think within theſe few years we

their Miniſtry doth, and how they are reſpected in their places,

Magiſtrates and Miniſters muſt ſtand or fall together. Therefore
let us go hand in hand together. Forbear to reprove us; or if you

Let Miniſters with us cry out againſt the ſins of the Citie, the
prophanation of God day, the contempt of the Word, the luxury
and exceſſe, the unmercifulneſſe to the poore; and the negligence of
Magiſtrates in not endevouring reformation. And what's the next?
They muſt look to be called to their Courts, to be cenſured and
threatned, their means and livelyhood to be taken away. Juſt a year
ago, upon this very day, and occaſion; the faithfull Miniſter of Chriſt,
who by the providence of God then preached, he was but a little in

though none evill could be found in him, and he had ſpoken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

                     <p>The very laſt week, on Thurſday, a godly-brother-Miniſter (at a

is all this? Surely, to button up our mouths, to make us afraid

for fear, forbear to tell the people of their tranſgreſſions,
and the houſe of <hi>Juda</hi> of their ſins? I am ſure <hi>Michaiah</hi> did not ſo,

pray! doth the reproving the faults, and negligences of Magiſtrates,
ſtrike at the root of Magiſtracy? Is that the way to bring it into
contempt? No, no; this is the way to eſtabliſh Magiſtracy, and
make it glorious. As for the wheels of our curious clocks and wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
is it a prejudice to them to be filed when they are ruſty, to be
ſcoured when they are foule, to be oyled when they turn too ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhly?
You are convinced, I dare ſay, that all this is for the good
of the wheels, to make them ſhine more bright, move more nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and do their office more faithfully. The application is eaſie: I
leave it to your ſelves. I ſhall draw to a concluſion of this point.
As for the wheels, be they little wheels, or be they great wheels, be

is ſpoken from God, in our hearing, concerning them; we muſt

how dreadfull is our doom?</p>

When I ſay to the wicked, thou ſhalt ſurely dye; and thou giveſt
him not warning, nor ſpeakeſt to warn the wicked from his wicked

The Sabbaths of the Lord are prophaned: old men, and old
women walk in the ſtreets: and our ſtreets are full of boys and
girles playing in the ſtreets on the Lords day: Fiſh hath been
openly cryed, and ſold in our ſtreets on the Lords day: Ale-houſ
S<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſhops of the devil, and the nurſeries of ſin do abound:
Beggars run up and down the ſtreets clamoring after every paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger:
and many diſtreſſed creatures overwhelmed with miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
ſit in their forlorn towers and diſmal holes, and want bread!
The oppreſſed cry out for want of Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>O Wheel! O Wheels! where are the Wheels all this while?</hi>
the great Wheels the Magiſtrates? why do they not ſtir? why
do they not turn, and run more frequently and diligently into
their ſeveral Wards? what not one Wheel appear to ſcatter the
open prophaners of the Lords day? What I not one one Wheel
to draw away the Fiſh on the Lords day? What not one Wheel
to break the brood of drunkards, and Ale-houſe-haunters? What
not one Wheel to draw off the beggars from our heels? or to
draw in neceſſary proviſion to he almoſt ſtarved members of
Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>O Wheels!</hi> Where are you? why move you not?
why do you not turn in your Sphear? It may be worth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring,
what is the matter the Wheels move no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</p>
                     <p>I doubt they are not round: its the round ſphaericall figure
that is fitteſt for motion: if there be Angles and corners in a
Wheel, twill never turn wel: corners are miſchivous things,
corners are dark, all the durt of the houſe is ſwept into the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
I fear, here's ſome cauſe our Wheels move no better:
there's too many corners amongſt them: dark corners of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
O let me ſpeak plainly; there's too many ſluttiſh corners,
I meon, of Vice, as pride, covetouſnes, luxury, and other ſins,
theſe hinder the motion! O <hi>Wheel!</hi> what! art thou not
round!</p>
                     <p>Or perhaps the Wheels may be too little. The <hi>Romans</hi> were
wont to uſe very great wheels for little chariots: they found
that the horſes had leſs labor in drawing, and yet they drew
greater burdens: <hi>Majores rotae, magisaptae ad rotationem;</hi> the
bigger the Wheels the more apt to roul and turn: what are
our Wheels too little trow we? have they too little ſubſtance,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102714:42"/>
two little height? Have they too little underſtanding to govern?
Too little ability? Oh yee little wheeles! look better to the
choiſe of your great wheels!</p>
                     <p>Do they not want eyes?<note place="margin">

of eyes, as you may ſee <hi>verſe</hi> 12. of this Chapter: round about
the rings they were ſet with eyes, as the heaven with ſtarres:
What are about the rings of our wheels? Nothing but great
iron hobnayles? No marvaile they move no better: They
are not <hi>Oculati,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sapientes.</note> they cannot ſee to move as they ſhould do:
they want that wiſdom, and other gifts and graces ſhould make
them ſit for government.</p>
                     <p>Or it may bee the wheeles are not well ſhod; they want a
good <hi>Strake;</hi> they have no courage, they are afraid of a checke,
if they ſhould be too active; they ſhould loſe the favour of
their friends, if they ſhould be too ſtrict in the execution of
juſtice: They have an eſtate to loſe, and they feare that:
Truly, it is with the ballances of juſtice often-times, as with
the ballance of the watch, or clocke, it never ſtirres, but
when the <hi>Crown-wheele,</hi> or <hi>ſpurre-wheele</hi> makes it go: So
you ſhall never ſee ſome men active any way, but as power
and neceſſity compell them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>O Wheele!</hi> thy circumference ſhould bee iron round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout:
thou ſhouldſt be a man of courage, elſe thou wilt never
move freely.</p>
                     <p>Or, may not this bee the cauſe of their not moving? the
want of GODS Spirit dwelling in them? the want of zeale
for God?</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why theſe wheeles moved ſo nimbly, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtically:
<hi>Chapter</hi> 1. 20. was becauſe the ſpirit of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
creature was in the Wheeles. They were not moved
by any externall cauſe, no hand turned them: But they were
moved by an inward principle: And it is the want of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
principles, that make our wheels ſtand ſtill. Well,</p>
                     <p>As for theſe ſtanding wheels, it is cryed unto them in my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:
<hi>O Wheel!</hi> the Lord rebukes thee.</p>
                     <p>2. Let us looke about, to ſpy out the ſecond fault of the
wheeles: They moved perhaps: but to very little, or no
purpuſe: So I doubt too many of our wheels, both greater,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102714:42"/>
and leſſer Wheels, Magiſtrates, Miniſters, and other; they are
enough in motion: but what do they? either <hi>aliud,</hi> or <hi>male:</hi>
either that that's ill, or that that's as ill as nothing, or worſe.
Their motion is juſt like that of the <hi>jack-wheels;</hi> they turn and
turn, but what do they turn? nothing but a fly at the top, and
a ſpit at the bottom: So too too many, and even of our great
Wheels; the fly plays and the ſpit goeth; they eat, they drink,
they feaſt, they play; they are merry and laugh; But for God,
for the ſervice of the publick; for the furthering Religion and
Reformation for the good of the City and particular Pariſhes
and Congregations, they move not an inch. Perhaps ſometimes
they will roul to the Court of Juſtice: and what do they there?
truly that which the <hi>count-wheel</hi> doth in the Clock; tell the
hours: they ſit turning their heads and looking about; but
move not their tongues, much leſs put forth their power for
God and the publick good. As for theſe unſerviceable wheels:
it is cryed unto them in my hearing, <hi>O Wheel!</hi> the Lord looks
on thee with indignation, caſt out the unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>
                     <p>3. A third faul that ſeems to be in the wheels, for which
they lye under Gods indignation, is their irregular motion.
As for <hi>Ezikiels</hi> wheels, chap. 1. 12. 17. their motion was even,
conſtant, uniform; as the living creatures which drew the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,
went ſtrait forward and they turned not when they went
ſo the wheels they followed them; when they went, they went
upon their four ſides, and they returned not when they went:
their motion was very regular. But here in this tenth chapter,
ſure God ſees ſome diſorder in the motion of <hi>Jeruſalems
wheels:</hi> for which he gave them a check in the Prophets hearing,
<hi>O Wheel!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And what diſorderly motions are there in all our wheels,
great and ſmal, high and low? Magiſtrates, Miniſters, and
Commons they have not moved in an uniform and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
way. Truly the greateſt part of our people have tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
like weathercocks, to and again, this way and that
way, and every way: they go forth one way, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
return another way. As the times turn they turn: when <hi>Popiſh
Innovations</hi> and <hi>Prelatical Tyranny</hi> brake in upon us as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ood;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102714:43"/>
then all turned <hi>Eaſtward;</hi> wheeled about in the houſe of God:
now they were at the desk, by and by in the middle alley, anon
bowing and cringing at the altar: How did the Prieſt and Clark
take their turns and anſwer one another in Pſalms and prayers,
running out of one thing into another! and all the people ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſitting, ſometimes ſtanding, ſometimes kneeling, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
making courtſie; and ever changing their poſtures; and this
way was cryed up by <hi>Baals Prieſte</hi> for the beauty of holineſs:
it was countenanced by the ſcarlet robes, and magnified by the
luke warm Proteſtants; thus moved the wheels a great while:
But now the times are turned and they are turned; yea turned
the quite contrary way: <hi>Separation</hi> is now grown into great
requeſt, and they that but the other day were driving on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Rome</hi> as faſt as they could; have now altered their courſe
and are hurrying towards <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> they are gotten out of
the <hi>Church of England</hi> already, and the ſuperſtitious Malignant
hath given the right hand of fellowſhip to the Separatiſt. <hi>O wheel!</hi>
thou moveſt irregularly. According to the change of place and
companies, they turn, and <hi>Proteus-like</hi> are any thing: amongſt
<hi>Papists</hi> they are <hi>Catholiques;</hi> amongſt <hi>Browniſts</hi> they are <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents:</hi>
In the Congregation they are ſeeming Saints: in the
tavern with lewd company they change their behavior as if they
were mad, their ſpeech faulters, and their ſpittle runs down by
their beards: to all theſe turning-temporizing Wheels, it is
cryed in my hearing; <hi>O Wheel!</hi> the Lord abhorrs thee.</p>
                     <p>But do we not ſee other irregulat motions? oh how confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly
do wheels move before mine eyes! How many gathered
Churches or Congregations are there? So many wheels they
are; and every wheel muſt move his own way: and no hand
muſt touch them to turn them all the ſame way. <hi>Luther</hi> was of
another mind: he determins that theſe wheels did ſignifie particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>Churches:</hi> And the ſimilitude of the wheels, they were all alike
in colour, bigneſs, height, motion; they turned all the ſame way,
did repreſent the Uniformity of Churches; that all the <hi>churches</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> in the whole world have and muſt have <hi>fimilem inceſſum,</hi>
the ſame goings in the ſanctuary; namely Uniformity in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
confeſſion of faith, form of Church government, Worſhip,
and Catechizing. But on the confuſion of our newgathered Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102714:43"/>
not two ſcarce of thoſe wheels move in the ſame way. To
theſe I cannot ſay, <hi>O wheel!</hi> for they will not be all one <hi>Catholike
Church</hi> made up of many particular congregations: but I muſt cry
to them, <hi>Oh Wheels!</hi> your motions are various, different, contrary,
confuſed, irregular; the Lord approves them not.</p>
                     <p>Do you not ſee abundance of falſe prophets run up and down like
wheels? Seducers, that compaſſe ſea and land, to make one of their
own profeſſion;<note place="margin">Matth. 23. 15.</note> and when he is made, they make him two-fold
more the child of hell, then they themſelves; theſe wheel about ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularly;
the ſpirit of Satan is in theſe wheels, and here's a check
for them: <hi>O ſeducers come back; why do you turn the people of
Chriſt out of the right way?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are a generation of <hi>Seekers</hi> (ſo they call themſelves) Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> gives them their true charcter, <hi>Ever learning, and never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 7.</note> Theſe are wheels that

they are ever finding, and ever loſing, they faſten upon no certain
way, but ever ſeeking for ſomething, and they know not what. The
Poets fain that <hi>Ixion</hi> for his ſlander of <hi>Juno,</hi> was in hell faſtened to

the truth, and ever ſlying from the truth, and never catch it,
or if they do, they let it go again: theſe move irregularity, and
here they have a check: <hi>Oh wheel!</hi> thy motion is tormenting, and
the end of it will be the loſſe of truth, of Chriſt, of heaven.</p>
                     <p>There are abundance of other wheels that move diſorderly; the
drunkard reels, and turns round in the ſtreets: the proud Phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
gallant is ever turning out of one faſhion into another; but the
moſt prodigious! ſight your eyes have yet ſeen, is a deformed mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
called <hi>Liberty of Conſcience;</hi> it is a ſpirit of confuſion, which
moves every wheel to turn according to the dictate of its private
ſpirit as it liſts.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Libertines muſt be left wholly to the freedom of their own
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102714:44"/>
conſciences: Oh conſcience, ſay they, is a tender thing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to impoſe a rule to regulate their motion, is no leſſe then ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny:
Church-government, and a coercive power to reſtrain and
check their motion, is no leſſe then perſecution. Every man muſt
hold what opinion he will joyne to what Church he will, worſhip
God as he will, and do what ſeems good in his own eyes.</p>
                     <p>Oh prodigious O woful ſpectacle! ſo many wheels and ſcarce
two of them have the ſame motion: but they move like ſcattered
feathers in a wind; or as <hi>Pharaohs Chariot-wheels</hi> in the red ſea;
ſmitten one from another, one this way, another that way. Theſe
wheels move irregularly: a good rule would guide them all the
ſame way: they wil at laſt claſh one againſt another, and break in
pieces: in the mean time: it is cryed unto them in my hearing,
from the God of Unity, peace and order, <hi>O Wheel!</hi> thy motion
and turning is as of the children of <hi>Belial</hi> that ſhake off the yoke.</p>
                     <p>4. A fourth and laſt thing which ſeems to be amiſs in the wheels
is this: They ſtop ſometimes: A while they move prettily wel, and
on the ſudden they ſtand ſtock-ſtil: Oh what ſtoppings are there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
our great Wheels? Juſt this day twelve moneth my <hi>reverend
brother</hi> performed the work which I do at this time; in his Sermon
he did exhort the people to do ſomething to the utmoſt of their
power which might conduce to the publick good and ſetlement of
truth &amp; peace: this was interpreted that the City would ſtrike in with
ſome petition tending to the Kingdoms peace, and wel-fare: To
this purpoſe a Petition was drawn (or a <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> if you
pleaſe to call it ſo) to back <hi>Londons Remonſtrance</hi> then newly
come forth; which Petition or Remonſtance, if it had taken effect,
might, in all probability, have done much good, and the Kingdom
not have been in thoſe ſtraits it is at this time: At the firſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
many were very forward for the Petition: the Wheels ratled
and turned very nimbly; all on the ſuddain there came a ſtop and
all the buſineſs was croſſed with much vehemency: A while, what
zeal was there againſt the Devils free-ſchools and nurſeries? I
mean, licentious, unlicenced alehouſes: Oh how loud did ſome
wheels crake? how bitterly did they ſpeak againſt them? how
did they threaten them? if ever they came in place they would do,
I that they would, great matters: at laſt power comes into their
hands, and what is done then? no new alehouſes licenced at all;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102714:44"/>
but all the old ones ſuffered and connived at: and they encreaſe
as fiſh in multitude; and no noiſe againſt them: what's the
matter trow? would not one think there had been ſome grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the Wheel, it is ſo quiet and ſtill, on the ſuddain? <hi>Rota
arida ſtridet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About three or four years ſince (as I am informed) when the
Kingdom was in great ſtraites, and the City in dayly fears: the
Magiſtrates then gave out many Warrants againſt Prophaners
of GODS Day: which by the faithfulneſs of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
puniſhing ſuch as were preſented, there was, as it were,
a new face upon the City, and nothing ſo much Prophaneſs as
formerly: here was a ſweet ratling of the Wheels: But ſince
that time it is obſerved that there hath been a remiſneſs
in the MAGISTRATES, Warrants have not been granted
ſo frequently; nor Officers encouraged in the Execution of
ſuch Warrants as have been granted, whereby the Prophanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of GODS Day encreaſeth more and more: They ſtop; the
wheels ſtop.</p>
                     <p>The Miniſters of the City (thoſe few that deſire to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful)
have with all humility, petitioned the <hi>Court of Aldermen</hi>
that they would purge the City of ſcandalous Miniſters, and caſt out
that unſavory ſalt, which hath been thrown out of the Country
upon us: that they would perfect <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of our Pariſhes:</hi>
that they would raiſe competent maintenance, and bring ſome more
godly and able Miniſters into the City. At the firſt motion we find
many with us, we have promiſes of aſſiſtance: oh the wheels
come ratling bravely: on the ſuddain all are ſtop'd: there's not
one moves, except it be the wrong way, no good motion goes on.</p>
                     <p>About ſix moneths ſince, or not much otherwiſe, there came a
Letter from the <hi>worthy Speaker</hi> of the Honorable Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
directed to the Maior, and ſome other faithful ones of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration:
requiring them to divide the City into <hi>Claſſes:</hi> to return
the names of ſuch as were fit to be <hi>Elders:</hi> By the way, take notice
all ye people: That Letter was no forged Letter. I ſpeak it in the
preſence of God, and I wil make it out to all the world; it was the
<hi>Speakers own letter,</hi> and the ſuperſcription and direction
was according to his COMMISSION. I ſay this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
did not lie a year and three quarters in a box, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102714:45"/>
nothing done: but preſently the Major called all, that were
concerned in it, together: in one day we laid out the <hi>Claſſis;</hi> we
nominated the fitteſt men in the City (I am confident of that) for
the Elderſhip; that very night we returned what we had done to
the <hi>Honorable Speaker:</hi> and we verily and juſtly expected, the
next return, to have received thanks, and a ratification of our work,
and the ſettling of Church-government in our City: O here the
Wheels rattled gallantly and moved freely; but on the ſuddain all
ſtopped; the whole work was at a ſtand, and ſo hath been ever
ſince.</p>
                     <p>In the name of God; what makes this ſtopping? Sure there's
ſome ruſty wheel amongſt the reſt that will not ſtir, nor ſuffer the
other wheels to ſtir; or there is ſome ill-condition'd wheel. It's a
ſtrange thing to ſee how one naughty wheel will carry another:
The phuſy-wheel of the watch, with its greatneſs carryeth all the
leſſer wheels as it pleaſeth. The mil-wheel with its coggs turns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the upper milſtone, the clack, and makes the hoppet ſerve
them as they pleaſe: other wheels they have their teeth by which
they ſtop or turn the reſt. And that I doubt is the reaſon of our
ſtoppings and contrary turnings: you ſhal ſee many good wheels,
and in a fair motion, freely running on in a good way: and on the
ſuddain they are ſtopped and turned. Why, how comes that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout?
Oh there are ſome Malignant Wheels amongſt the reſt, that
are contrived in the engine unſeen: Theſe by their greatneſs and
power, or by their coggs and flattery, or by their teeth and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
they make them afraid to go on in any thing that tends to the
publick good, and the advancement of Gods glory, and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
ſettlement. Oh that theſe ruſty and ill-ſhaped wheels were
filed, or oyled, or removed, and better put in their room. In the
10. Verſe of this Chapter; you ſhal ſee the appearance of the
wheels was, as if one wheel had been in another wheel; which
moſt think was not comprehenſively: as if a little wheel had been
contained in a great wheel: no the wheels were all of a bigneſs.
This therefore they conceive was tranſverſly: one wheel turned
right forth upon the ground, and then there was another wheel did
cut that wheel in the very midſt with right angles, in the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of a Sphaere, and moved with a croſs and contrary motion:
Ah! ſo it is with our Wheels; there is ever a <hi>wheel</hi> in a <hi>wheel:</hi>
                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:102714:45"/>
one croſs wheel in the midſt that ſpoils the motion of all the reſt.
As for theſe Wheels; it is cryed unto them from the Throne of
Glory, in my hearing, <hi>O Wheel!</hi> the Lord gives thee a check:
mend thy motion, turn better, or elſe thou wilt break and deſtroy
the Chariot of the Church, Commonwealth and City. I have done
with the O! of Indignation and Reprehenſion.</p>
                     <p>Now follows the ſecond pair: namely
the O! of

                     </p>
                     <p>Jeruſalem <hi>was reproved ſharply in the former O! but ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
not: therefore now follows another O! more grievous
and dreadful:</hi> viz. <hi>a threatning and a lamenting O! O Wheel
thou ſhalt be broken! Oh</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>thou ſhalt ſuddainly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
for thy wickedneſs and obſtinacy. O! and alas for</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem!
<hi>The very like ſad expreſſion you have from the mouth of
Chriſt, in the</hi> 19. <hi>of</hi> Luke, <hi>ver.</hi> 41. <hi>When he was come neer, he
beheld the City and wept over it; ſaying,</hi> O! if thou hadſt known,
even thou at leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy
peace; but now they are hid from thine eyes: For the days ſhal
come upon thee thas thine enemies ſhal caſt a trench about thee,
and compaſs thee round and keep thee in on every ſide, and ſhal lay
thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee, and they
ſhal not leave in thee one ſtone upon another; becauſe thou kneweſt
not the time of thy Viſitation.</p>
                     <p>And here it wil be ſeaſonable to give you the ſum and parts of
the Chapter, and to ſhew you more clearly the coherence of the
text.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Viſion</hi> doth moſt neerly concern <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> in the 3. Verſ.
you ſhal ſee the Cherubins ſtanding on the right ſide of the houſe:
that is of the <hi>Temple of Jeruſalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The proper end of the Viſion was to ſhew the certainty and the
neer approach of the deſtruction of the Jews; the living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Gods Angels were armed with power from God to take
vengeance on them; they were winged, ſwift for execution, and
<hi>Jeruſalems</hi> wo came running upon wheels.</p>
                     <p>There's a tow-fold judgment threatned to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> which cuts
the Chapter into two parts.</p>

1. The Lord firſt ſhews to the Prophet that he wlll burn the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with fire, in the 7 firſt <hi>Verſes.</hi> The Lord ſpake to the man clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with linnen, and ſaid, go in between the wheels, and fill thine
hand with coals of fire from between the Cherubims, and ſcatter
them over the City: and he went in, in my ſight, <hi>Ezekiel;</hi> and
took the fire accordingly, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. and went out, to do execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>2. Then ſecondly: the Lord ſheweth to the Prophet, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
by his appearing in the Temple, that he is about to depart
from the Temple, City and Nation: from the 8. Ver. to the end:
moſt plainly in the 18. Ver. Then the glory of the Lord departed
from off the threſhold of the houſe.</p>
                     <p>Now before the Lord goeth quite away, his voyce eries to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
<hi>O Wheel! O Jeruſalem</hi> repent: or elſe O Jeruſalem! I will
have no more to do with thee: I will depart, and ſuddain and
fearful deſtruction ſhal come upon thee: The ſum of all is,</p>
                     <p>An O!<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> of Commination ever follows an O! of Reprehenſion:
if the Lord call to a people, and they be not humbled and reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
then the Lord will cry againſt them in his wrath; even with
the cry of a travailing woman,<note place="margin">Iſa, 42. 14.</note> and quite forſake them, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſtroy them. Hear what the Lord ſaith concerning the Jews.</p>
                     <p>Jer. 44. 4. I ſent unto you all my ſervants the Prophets, riſing
early, and ſending: ſaying, Oh do not this abominable thing that
I hate. <hi>There's an O! of Admonition and Reprehenſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from
their wickedneſs, to burn no incenſe unto other gods.</p>
                     <p>6. Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth and was
kindled in the Cities of Judah, and in the ſtreets of Jeruſalem:
and they are waſted and deſolate, as at this day.</p>
                     <p>The Application will come cloſe to <hi>Norwich,</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> to
our ſelves: hear and tremble.</p>
                     <p>As for the ſins of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> I am ſure we are as deep
as they: Had I time to gather a catalogue of ſins out of <hi>Ezekiel:</hi>
you would verily think that he had received his viſions in our City:
the very ſame ſins are as rife with us as with the Jews. You ſhall
find them accuſed (if you read the Propheſie) of abominable Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry:
groſs Superſtition: Corruption in the worſhip and ſervice
of God: horrible contempt of the Word: deſpiſing, mocking,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102714:46"/>
perſecuting Gods Meſſengers: ſcorning at all goodneſs: perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
breaking their Covenants with God and man: Fearful
prophanation of Gods holy Sabbaths: barbarous oppreſſion:
pride; luxury: fulneſs of bread: abundance of idleneſs: hardneſs
of heart, and unmercyfulneſs to the poor: there was then a ſtrong
Malignant party that with all their wit and ſtrength oppoſed the
Reformation endeavored by <hi>Jeremiah, Ezekiel,</hi> and others: and
now what think you? <hi>mutato nomine:</hi> change but the name:
for <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> read <hi>Norwich:</hi> for <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> read <hi>England,</hi>
and doth it not hold right? are not thoſe ſins, and many more,
ours?</p>
                     <p>When the Lord ſaw that their iniquity was great, and their ſin
very grievous, he cryed unto them with a mighty voyce, for it was
in the Prophets hearing: the voyce came from the Throne over the
Temple in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was by the river <hi>Chebar</hi> in
<hi>Babylon:</hi> a voyce indeed that could reach ſo far: So loud the
Lord cryed <hi>O Wheel!</hi> an O of Reprehenſion and admonition:
O do not theſe abominations which my ſoul hateth: but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fnſed
to hearken.</p>
                     <p>I know you cannot miſs applying of it: hath not the Lord cryed
in our ears by his ſons of thunder? have not the faithful meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of the Lord ſhewed the people their tranſgreſſions, and rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
them ſharply? Have they not diſcovered their dangers, and
called them to repentance, ſaying O do not theſe abominable things
which the Lord hateth?</p>
                     <p>Mark how God proceeds with them, when he ſees they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
thorns, and briers, and ſcorpions, and rebellious, and an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
people: then with a ſtretched out hand from heaven he reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth to <hi>Ezekiel a roll of a book,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezek, 2. 9, 10</note> and when it was ſpread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Prophet, he ſaw that it was written within and without:
and there was written therin, <hi>lamentations, and mourning, and wo:</hi>
he threatens dreadful deſtruction: he cries out Chapter the 7. <hi>An
end! the end is come upon the four corners of the Land: an evil,
an only evil ſhal ſuddainly come:</hi> and in this 10. Chap. The Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
is begun: the <hi>Angel</hi> ſcatters coals of fire about the City.</p>
                     <p>I would to God the Application were not ſo manifeſt as that
none can miſs it. We have continued a ſtiff-necked people: we have
walked ſtubbornly, kicked at reprehenſion, and we have hated to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102714:47"/>
be reformed: and now the Lord hath ſcattered coals of fire about
our Cities and Country: even the hot fire of war and contention,
the coals of juniper blown up by the ſpirit of diviſion: O the fire
burns, the fire burns: poor <hi>England</hi> is conſuming apace, and is
like to be turned into aſhes ſhortly.<note place="margin">☜</note> And here I cannot but ſet a
hand to point at two remarkable Circumſtances by the way.</p>
                     <p>One is the Circumſtance of the place whence the coals were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
namely,<note place="margin">Ver. 2, 3, 7.</note> 
                        <hi>from between the Cherubims</hi> in the Temple: to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh
that they were Temple-ſins that kindled the fire of Gods
wrath; contempt of the Word and Miniſters; falſe Doctrine,
Corruption in Gods Worſhip, Prophanation of the Sabbath, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledg
and Idolatry: nothing doth ſo much incenſe the Lord and
provoke him to fury, as Temple-ſins; Corruption in Religion and
Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>The other Circumſtance remarkable, is the perſon that takes and
ſcatters the coals about <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> it's the man clothed with lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen:
who is deſcribed in the 9. Cap. ver. 2. &amp; 4. to have a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
inkhorn by his ſide, whoſe office there was to ſet a mark upon
the foreheads of them that mourn: which ſure is none other but
the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> in the former Chapter you ſee him a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,
a Saviour: here in this Chapter he is a conſumer, a deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
Chriſt firſt comes to ſeek and to ſave, to call ſinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
but if they hearken not, then he changeth his work and he
comes armed with flaming fire to execute vengeance upon all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent
perſons.<note place="margin">Iſa. 66. 15, 16. 2 Theſ, 1, 8.</note> O ſad condition when Chriſts comes in anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a people! then is ruine dreadful and unavoydable; when
the Lord cries to us by his Miniſters and calls us to repentance; as
long as we hearken to his voice, we have Chriſt to plead for us:
but when our advocate becomes our enemy how deplorable is
our condition? I fear, I fear it is the man in white linnen, that is
now ſcattering coals of fire about our City and Country; and the
Lord is departing from us. But yet before he departs from Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
he calls to it, <hi>O Wheel!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Lords departure from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is by degrees: he doth not
fly away in an inſtant: no, no, the Lord leaves them, as if he were
loth to depart:<note place="margin">Ezek, 9, 3.</note> Obſerve a little his motions. In the former
Chapter Verſe 3. The glory of the <hi>God of Iſrael</hi> went up from
the Cherub to the threſhold of the houſe: that is from the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102714:47"/>
Mercy-ſeat in the holy place to the door of the Sanctuary, ready to
go out; and there the Lord tatries a while before he depart. In
this tenth Chapter, verſe 18. he removes a little further. <hi>The glory
of the Lord departed from off the threſhold of the houſe, and ſtood
over the Cherubims:</hi> That is, he went forward to the Eaſt gate
of the great Court: on the top of that gate aloft were placed Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims,
and there the Lord reſted a while, before he went quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
In the next Chapter,<note place="margin">Ezek. 11. 23.</note> verſe 23. he removes yet further; <hi>The
glory of the Lord went up from the middeſt of the City, and ſtood
upon the mountain which is on the Eaſt-ſide of the City;</hi> that is,
Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> and there he reſts a while: But why doth he abide
upon mount <hi>Olivet?</hi> Truly, ſome are of opinion that the Lord
ſtayed upon the mount, to ſee the burning of the City, and to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over it: As did <hi>Nero,</hi> when <hi>Rome</hi> was fired, he gate him
up to the top of a hill, and there did ſing, and rejoyce at the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.
The Lord had often called to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prov. 1. 24. 26.</note> and they had refuſed,
he had ſtretched out his hand, and none would regard; therefore
now he ſits upon the Mount, and laughs at their deſtruction, and
mocks at the comming of their fear.</p>
                     <p>But I rather think, and hope, he ſtaid a while upon the Mountain,
to be called back again. Before he went out of the City he cryed to
them, <hi>O Wheel! Oh Jenuſalem!</hi> yet, yet ſeek me, and I will be
found of you; call to me, and I will return, and dwell with you.</p>
                     <p>Neither here can you avoid the Application: Doth not the
Lord ſeem to be departing from <hi>England?</hi> But he hath not taken
his ſlight all at once; he hath with-drawn himſelf by degrees: In
the time of the late prelaticall tyranny and perſecution, when the
worſhip of God was corrupted, the faithfull Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
ſilenced, all manner of popiſh, ſuperſtitious innovations obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
then God ſeemed to be gone to the threſhold, ready to go out
of <hi>England;</hi> but departed not.</p>
                     <p>When the Commotions, and concuſſions began between the
two Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> threatning the breaking
of both. Then God ſeemed to be going ſtill further from us; from
the threſhold out of the door; onward on his way from <hi>England,</hi>
but yet he departed not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When the bloody inteſtine warre began between the</hi> King <hi>and
his</hi> Parliament, <hi>then the Lord ſeemed to be departing quite away;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102714:48"/>
then was</hi> thè noiſe of a whip,<note place="margin">Nah. 3 2.</note> and the noiſe of the ratling of the
wheels, and of the praunſing horſes, and of the jumping chariots:
The horſe-man lifted up both the bright ſword, and the glittering
ſpear, and there was a multitude of ſlain, and great number of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes,
<hi>and the Lord ſeemed to ſit aloft upon his holy Mountain,
laughing at our deſtruction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But bleſſed be his holy Name, we find he is not quite gone;
there's a little ſtay of his judgements: I hope, beloved Chriſtians,
the Lord ſtayes yet upon Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> the Mountain of peace, and
he expects when we ſhould call him back again: <hi>Yet there is hope
in Iſrael concerning this thing.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezra 10. 2.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Voice of God from the Throne hath called to us a long
time; <hi>Oh Wheel?</hi> Now let us call to <hi>Mount Olivet:</hi> O Lord our
God, Depart not from us; let us call him back with our true and
hearty repentance, with our thorough reformation; with our team
and prayers: who can tell but God may yet repent and return, and
turn away from his fierce anger, that we periſh not? Return, Oh
Lord, to thy thouſands in our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and dwell amongſt us again:
<hi>Amen.</hi>

flame, and his wheels as burning fire.</hi> Gods Throne moves upon
Wheels: What's the meaning of that? It ſignifieth to us that
God is the great King and Judg of all the world: he ſits above,
and by his powerful providence governeth and judgeth all things:
But how? not immediately: he carryeth on his judgment
by wheels: thoſe wheels below the Throne, are Kings and Judges
of the earth: by them God acts and executeth his judgments. O
Magiſtrates! remember you are the wheels of Gods Throne: Oh
that theſe wheels were as burning fire! that they would conſume
the wicked like droſs, that their light might ſhine before men, that
they would be hot &amp; zealous for God: that they would move ſwiftly,
turn with facility, count it a joy to do judgment: <hi>O ſi! O utinam:</hi>
would to God our Magiſtrates were all ſuch.</p>
                     <p>Finally,<note place="margin">3.</note> I come yet more cloſe to the work of the day: and in
the laſt place, I ſhal crave leave to ſpeak the word to a particular
wheel: the greateſt of the wheels, the chief Magiſtrate new elected.</p>

I have obſerved of late years: the Preacher commonly hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
his ſpeech perſonally to the New-Elect; and given him a
charge, or rather a word of Exhortation: I ſhal follow former
Preſidents: and ſo much the rather becauſe the chief Magiſtrate,
to whom I am to ſpeak, lives under my charge: and alſo becauſe
my Text calls me to call particularly</p>
                     <p>O Wheel!</p>

drive proſperouſly. Be not offended that I ſet the Wheel a going
to day; I hope it will turn the better all the year after.</p>
                     <p>And firſt:<note place="margin">1.</note> 
                        <hi>O Wheel!</hi> it is with you this day as it was with the
Wheel under my hand: Chap. 1. 19. it was <hi>liſted up from the
earth,</hi> and ſo are you lifted up above your brethren! Remember
who it is that hath advanced you: even the Son of God that ſits
upon the Throne of Glory. <hi>For promotion cometh neither from
the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor from the South: but GOD is
the Judg, he putteth down one and ſetteth up another:</hi> Pſa. 75. 6, 7.
Be not impatient then under the great burden of Government that
is fallen upon your ſhoulders, at your election: it was the Lord
that turned all the wheels, and he ſerued you up into this place of
honor: do you ſubmit to this diſpenſation: be thankful, and move
ſwiftly, and zealouſly for that God who hath lift you up: <hi>be a
wheel of burning fire.</hi>

a round is the embleme of perfection: as being every where equal

The <hi>Sphaeres</hi> are round, the lights of heaven are round;
the heads of beaſts indeed are long, and ſquare, and corner'd: but
the heads of men are round, and the wheels of Gods Chariot and
Throne ought to be round: away, away with all unevenneſs:

the pleaſant turning of the Wheel, be round <hi>O Wheel!</hi> be round:

Gods faithful Miniſters may have countenance and maintenance.
<hi>O Wheel! O Wheel!</hi> never leave turning, and turn all wheels to
bring more faithful and able Miniſters into the City. Oh it's a ſad
thing, that there ſhould be 36. Pariſhes within the Walls, and I think

have ſuch Miniſters as they had as good have none, perhaps better:

glory: and when God cryeth to you, ſtand not ſtill, but turn, and
be doing:<note place="margin">Gal 6 16.</note> and <hi>if you walk according to this rule, peace ſhal be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you and mercy, and upon the Iſrael of God:</hi> The Lord hath hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
you, lay out your ſelf to honour God; be faithfull, and then I
promiſe you another O! an O of gratulation and exultation: At
the great day of retribution, when the Son of God ſhall ſit upon his
Throne to judg the world, and to give to every one according to his
work: Then ſhall the Lord ſay unto you; <hi>O wheel!</hi> thou haſt turned
very well, thou haſt done worthily in thy place? <hi>Well done O thou
good and faithfull ſervant, thou haſt been faithfull in a little, I
wil make thee ruler over much, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.
Oh Wheel!</hi> thou didſt turn painfully in my ſervice. Now reſt, and

I was even about to ſtop here: but let me remember my ſelf:
one word more, I beſeech you, and then I ceaſe. By wheels are
chiefly meant reaſonable creatures, that's apparent. Then welbelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Chriſtians, we are all wheels, and then we muſt alſo al conceive,
that the Word is cryed to every one of us in particular, from the
Throne of glory, <hi>O Wheel!</hi> To thee, and to me the Sonne of God
cryes <hi>O Wheel!</hi> turn, turn! God hath appointed to every one of
us that are here in his preſence a ſeverall motion, to one he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
one work, to another, another work; one wheel he placeth
in the <hi>Church,</hi> another in the <hi>Common-Wealth:</hi> O let us all move
in our ſeverall Spheres according to the word of God. Not only
Magiſtrates, thoſe great wheels, in their places; but let us Miniſters
in the orb of the Church move diligently and faithfully:<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 2.</note>

us watch in all things, endure aſſlictions, do the work of true E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts,
and fulfill our Miniſtry:</hi> The Lord cryes to us, <hi>O
Wheels!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let all the people move in their ſeverall orbs, with all diligence!
it's cryed to the leaſt wheel: <hi>O Wheel!</hi> turn, turn, turn, do the work

Let every one be ever turning, rolling, and acting in the duties of his

                     <p>And let us not only do Gods work in our ſeverall ſtations, but
let us do it with readineſſe, alacrity, and cheerfulneſſe: Let's be all
round; the ſphericall bodies are moſt apt to turn; lay a perfect
round ball upon a plain, and the leaſt touch will make it roll. O
that with the Prophet I could hear the ratling of the wheels, and
the noiſe of the clapping of the wings of the living creatures, which
expreſſe their activity and zeale in the ſervice of God.</p>
                     <p>And let us be conſtant in our motion;<note place="margin">Cap. 3. 12. 13.</note> like the wheels let us run
on, and not turn back till we have quite finiſhed our courſe. The
living creatures move, the Angels move, the wheels move ſwiftly,

To move us to this diligence and alacrity in the ſervice of God,
it is enough that we remember we are wheels: The Wheel as it
muſt have a motion, ſo it muſt of neceſſity have an end of motion:
God hath decreed juſt how long every wheel ſhall move: that is,
from the day of our birth, to the day of our death; but how long
that ſhall be, or how ſhort, none knows, but he that ſits on the
Throne of Glory, and with the hand of his providence turns eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
wheel. This is certain; our motion ſtill is neerer and neerer to the
end: what a deal of our motion is ſpent ſince we came together
into this place? <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle calls the progreſs of our life,

                        <hi>the wheel of nature:</hi> our life runs upon
wheels: and none can ſtop them till our bodies roll into the grave:
It is but a very little while we have to move: therefore let us hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to the voyce of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>While we have time
and opportunity let us do good. Hieroms</hi> tranſlation reads my
Text, <hi>&amp; rotas iſtas vocavit volubiles:</hi> the Lord called them
ſwift-turning wheels: let us turn ſwiftly, for we have but a very
little time to move. This is it which <hi>Solomon</hi> preſſeth, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.
in the firſt Verſe: he exhorteth to early turning: <hi>Remember now
thy Creator in the days of thy youth:</hi> his argument from the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
and uncertainty of mans life: the evil days will come ſhortly:
the Sun, Moon and Starrs will be darkned: the keepers of the
houſe ſhall tremble, and the ſtrong men bow, and the grinders
ceaſe: man poſteth to his long home: ſhortly the <hi>golden bowl</hi>
ſhall be broken, and the <hi>pitcher</hi> ſhall be broken at the fountain:
and Verſe 6. <hi>The Wheel ſhall be broken at the Ciſtera:</hi> and what
is the meaning of that? I ſhall ſhortly tell you what I conceive,
not condemning other mens judgments. The Stomack is the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern:
All the parts and members of the body are the wheel: the
blood, that (as judicious Phyſitians tell me) keeps a conſtant circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
motion in the body, wheeling about continually, whileſt a
man liveth: as the wheel draweth water out of the well, ſo the
ſeveral parts and members of the body draw nouriſhment from
the ſtomach, which is conveyed by veins and arteries as by the rope
and bucket: the wheel is broken at the ciſtern, when nature cea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>oh wheels!</hi> let us turn ſpeedily to the Lord our God! let us
