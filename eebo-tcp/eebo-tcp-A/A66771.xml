            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THough I am numbred among Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, and ſome think me (as <hi>Ahab</hi> did <hi>Elias)</hi> to be one of thoſe who troubles <hi>Iſrael;</hi> I have honeſtly endeavoured to ſerve God and my Country, even in thoſe actings, which are ſuppoſed <hi>Criminal;</hi> and perhaps may
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95695:4"/>
have, yet, ſomething to do, wherein I may be further ſerviceable in my <hi>Generation.</hi> Therefore, feeling my health impaired by being above ſix Months without hearing, ſhut up in a cloſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, deprived of thoſe conveniencies and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries which my Age and condition require; I think it my duty whilſt I have ſome ſtrength left, to uſe the beſt means I can, to preſerve my <hi>Life</hi> for his ſake who gave it (though I have little cauſe to value the ſame for its own ſake) being confident whatever hardſhip ſhall attend it, that he will permit no more to be impoſed on me, then he ſhall render conduceable to his Honour, and make me able to bear. Our late Epidemical diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, have reduced me from a conſiderable Eſtate, to be much leſs worth then nothing, and if thoſe bluſterings had hitherto continued which ruffled about me, before, and when thoſe <hi>Papers</hi> were ſeized, for which I am confined; doubtleſs, the <hi>Flouds</hi> had ere this time overflowed my ſoul, or the ſtream ran ſo ſtrong againſt me, that it had been impoſſible, I ſhould have landed a <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance</hi> within your threſhold, with hope of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation; and what may be now done I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; nevertheleſs, you being again aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, whom I am ſuppoſed to have Scandalized, (and long time elapſed without Proſecution, ſince the limit of my confinement hither by Warrant) I conceive your diſpleaſure (if you be diſpleaſed with me) to be ſo moderate, that I am emboldened to offer my ſelf to your remembrance, and to make my defence by this <hi>Addreſſe;</hi> whereto, if you pleaſe to vouchſafe Audience, a few minutes with patience, it may peradventure, ſave you the

expence of many dayes hereafter, with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantages to boote; and though the length of it threatens tediouſneſs, it may prove as well worth your hearing as moſt Cauſes, ten times longer in pleading, when <hi>Friends</hi> are made, and great <hi>Lawyers</hi> Feed. I ſhall be hopeful alſo that this will come the more ſeaſonably to move your compaſſion, becauſe it comes ſo ſoon after your late <hi>Commemoration</hi> of the greateſt favour vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed by God to the <hi>Humane Nature;</hi> and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the deliverance of an <hi>Innocent</hi> out of Priſon, may be as allowable at a <hi>Chriſtian Feaſtival,</hi> as Liberty was to a Murtherer at the <hi>Jewiſh Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am, and have alwayes been (however miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented) ſo true a lover of the <hi>Publick Peace,</hi> that I was never deſignedly active in pulling down, or ſetting up any <hi>Supream Power,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in defaming thoſe who are in <hi>Authority;</hi> nor purpoſely falſe to any, though I have been accidentally diſſervicable to ſome (when the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of <hi>Supremacy</hi> were ſhared among them who were a medly of <hi>true Friends,</hi> and <hi>Traytors</hi> to <hi>God, King</hi> and <hi>People;</hi> and when many of the late <hi>Diſſenting Parties</hi> were in Profeſſion and Action ſo fallacious in their <hi>words</hi> &amp; <hi>deeds</hi> to each other, and to themſelves; as alſo ſo repugnant, that few knew in whom to confide; and when <hi>wiſer men then I,</hi> were guilty of many failings.

in all Ages, though many of them, in the <hi>Times,</hi> and among the <hi>Nations</hi> with whom they lived, had not much reſpect, nor ſo much <hi>Civil Authority</hi> as a <hi>Petty Conſtable.</hi> I preſumed on their <hi>Priviledges,</hi> and in order to the diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my Duty, lately deſigned a <hi>Poem,</hi> called <hi>Vox Vulgi,</hi> perſonating <hi>(more Poetico)</hi> the <hi>Counties, Cities</hi> and <hi>Burroughs</hi> of this <hi>Nation,</hi> reprehenſorily expoſtolating a few particulars, relating to what was then rumored, touching the Deportment of ſome of their <hi>Truſtees;</hi> And I was thereto moved by the many murmurings, ſecretly whiſpered, or openly devulged by <hi>Common fame,</hi> to the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or fomenting of dangerous. <hi>Animoſities,</hi> though perhaps falſe; and to the infringing of our <hi>Common Peace,</hi> if true; Thoſe <hi>Rumors</hi> I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to expreſſe in ſuch <hi>manner</hi> as they were ſpoken, and with ſuch <hi>Inferences</hi> as were made upon them by others, or naturally reſulted from them in my apprehenſion; that, having fixed and made viſible by <hi>words,</hi> thoſe <hi>Notions</hi> which flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to and fro within me, I might the better ſee what they amounted unto; and make uſe of them to ſuch good purpoſes, as I found cauſe of. And, I confeſſe, I made thoſe whom I perſonated act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Reprehenſory</hi> part, to ſpeak as plainly, as boldly, and as Magiſterially, as I thought it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them; becauſe, <hi>fearful reprovers</hi> make <hi>fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs offenders.</hi> Therefore, I conceive that which I did, was neither a tranſgreſſion againſt any <hi>Poſitive Law,</hi> intrenchment upon <hi>good manners,</hi> nor abuſe of my <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or <hi>natural Freedom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having almoſt finiſhed what I intended, I thought fit to offer it to the conſideration of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95695:6"/>
men; and before I would make it publick (which whether I ſhould have done or not, neither I my ſelf, nor any other man certainly knowes) I reſolved (that miſconſtruction might be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) to offer thoſe <hi>rumors</hi> which I had Collected, together with ſuch probable <hi>reſults</hi> as might ariſe from them, to the private view and Cenſure of ſome diſcreet and Honourable Perſons, who were favoured by the <hi>King,</hi> that, if to them they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared conſiderable, their prudence might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of that <hi>compoſure</hi> as they thought fit: And the Earl of <hi>Clarenden,</hi> Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> (though to me a ſtranger) being reputed of ſo much Honour and Integrity, that the King judges him worthy to be intruſted with diſpenſing his <hi>Conſcience</hi> in the chief Court of Equitie, I (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to preſent it to him in writing as ſoon as finiſhed) had prepared an <hi>Epigram</hi> to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which was inſerted in the firſt draught of the ſaid <hi>Poem,</hi> and ſeized by a Doctor (whom I think they call <hi>Maſter of the Faculties)</hi> of what <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi> I know not, except it be a <hi>Faculty of Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring.</hi> For, without any Legal Warrant to me ſhown, he in a hoſtile, rather then in a Legal civil manner, ranſacked my Chamber, Cloſſet and Cheſts; took away goods belonging to other men, as well as mine; carried away by a Porter, a large Bagg-full of Books, written by ſeveral Authors, as alſo <hi>Papers, Letters, Bills, Evidences, Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances,</hi> with whatſoever elſe he pleaſed, which are all ſtill detained, ſave a very few, to my damage and other mens; ſome of them being of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, for ought I know, that they might have undone me, if I had not been undone before:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95695:6"/>
and though it cannot yet appear, others may thereby ſuffer great detriment hereafter.</p>
            <p>The laſt <hi>draught</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Poem,</hi> having many <hi>Alterations</hi> and <hi>Additions,</hi> which made it differ from the former, I purpoſed to make both agree in expreſſing my whole mind, had it not been prevented by that ſeizure. I added likewiſe, a <hi>Poſt-ſcript</hi> to the ſaid <hi>Epigram,</hi> of about four or ſix lines (as I remember) whereby I ſignified to the ſaid Earl, that foraſmuch, as in confidence on his Nobleneſs, and Humanity, theſe <hi>Papers</hi> were to him privately communicated, I preſumed and expected (however they were by him reliſhed) that no uſe ſhould he made of them to my diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage (or words to that effect) which evidently implies that I had no <hi>Lybellous intention.</hi> The ſaid <hi>Doctor</hi> hath perhaps ſo much candor, that he will atteſt his ſeizure of the ſaid <hi>Epigram,</hi> with the ſaid Books, as alſo of his then taking ſpecial notice thereof; but if not, I can make forth what I affirm as well by a probable <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> as by other <hi>Teſtimony</hi> if need be; though I was then in ſome things wanting to my ſelf, by that ſudden ſurprizal: For, I was ſo much diſtempered to ſee my honeſt intention, likely to be quite made void, by taking away every line of what I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that I regarded not what might befall my <hi>Perſon</hi> thereby; and ſhould not have been ſo calmed as I now am, and then was within a few Minutes; but that ſomething aſſured my heart, the loſs of thoſe <hi>Papers</hi> in that manner, would produce more advantages both to me, and to what God hath determined, then if it had ſucceeded otherwiſe; and I have in part already ſo found it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:95695:7"/>
But for that <hi>mercy</hi> I owe nothing to the <hi>world;</hi> for, notwithſtanding my <hi>cautiouſneſs</hi> to avoid gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving juſt cauſe of offence, the ſaid <hi>Poem</hi> being quite taken out of my hand, (ſo that I could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it for my Vindication) it hath been ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented by <hi>Fragments,</hi> to his Majeſties <hi>Privy Councill</hi> (they not having leaſure to peruſe it all in ſo ragged a hand as mine) that I was about ſix Months paſt committed to this Priſon, as a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller againſt this Houſe of <hi>Commons:</hi> Before which <hi>Commitment,</hi> I heard a line or two, of the ſaid <hi>Poem</hi> repeated in that injurious manner, to the <hi>Attorny General</hi> (who ſeemed to me ſo pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, not to regard the officiouſneſs of the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former)</hi> as made me perceive what was intended. For his objecting my words in that mode, without the <hi>qualifications</hi> preceding, or ſubſequent, made them appear like the Devils quoting of <hi>holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> or like his abuſing the <hi>Sacred Text,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>curſed is he who doth the work of the Lord,</hi> and leaves out this Principal word, <hi>negligently.</hi> Thus do I ſeem to be dealt withall, contrary to my apparent meaning; For, in the Title of that <hi>Poem, called a Lybel,</hi> wherein the <hi>Counties, Cities,</hi> and <hi>Burroughs,</hi> are perſonated, reprehending their <hi>Prevaricating Truſtees</hi> onely, according to what was commonly famed; there is a premiſed <hi>Salvo,</hi> preſerving the honour of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and of every faithful individual Member thereof, from thoſe reproofs, and the ſaid <hi>Salvo</hi> was not there ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bally expreſſed onely, but likewiſe really intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and I effectually endeavoured throughout the whole <hi>Poem</hi> to excuſe them from what was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranſacted by <hi>Surprize</hi> or otherwiſe, as alſo by ſo
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95695:7"/>
reproving thoſe that were faulty, that no man might be perſonally defamed though guilty; yea, ſo rather, that every individual offender privately applying thoſe reproofs to himſelf, as he finds cauſe, might reform ſecretly what was amiſſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Parliament,</hi> or this <hi>Houſe</hi> cannot be Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized by diſcovering of meer cauſual failings in that manner, or of ſuch contingences as were not in their Power to prevent: nor is any man juſtly to be blamed, for modeſtly taking notice of them, with an intention, to ſeek redreſs for what may mishappen thereby. If there be no ſuch <hi>Prevaricators</hi> among you, as it was defamed, no man among you, is then reproved or concerned in that <hi>Poem.</hi> If there be ſuch, they keeping there own Counſel, and reforming there man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, may be as free from Scandal as they were before that <hi>Poem</hi> was written, though it ſhould be devulged; and I think it would add to your Honour, if publiſhed with your allowance; for the beſt way for men to prevent diſparagement by <hi>general reproofs,</hi> is to take no notice that they more concern them, then every other man; and to approve of it as tending to the depreſſing of <hi>Vice,</hi> and the advance of <hi>Vertue.</hi>

            <p>If we may not in <hi>genaral terms</hi> reprehend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet and vitious actings, in ſuch a mode, and with ſuch <hi>Epithites</hi> as to them belong, I may well affirm <hi>Vices</hi> are more priviledged then <hi>Vertues,</hi> and that <hi>Morality</hi> is in hazzard to be brought to utter contempt.

rightly underſtood) ſhall be judged <hi>Criminal?</hi> and, when ſome who misjudged them, do know in their own Conſciencies, that they expreſs no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is true, and fit to be offered to conſideration?

            <p>But, I having onely gathered together, what the <hi>wind</hi> had ſcattered, with a purpoſe rather to make a <hi>Lenitive</hi> then a <hi>Coroſive,</hi> deſigned to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it to ſuch hands, as I thought fitteſt to make application: For, perhaps (conſidering of what <hi>Ingredients</hi> it conſiſts) if I ſhould have preſented it to your <hi>Speaker,</hi> or to any other of your <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> he or they, might as juſtly have been ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my <hi>confederate,</hi> and an <hi>acceſſary Lybeller,</hi> as I now am to be a <hi>Principal one.</hi>

            <p>It may be objected againſt what I have raiſed from <hi>Fame,</hi> that ſhe is a <hi>Lyar;</hi> I confeſs it true, as well in her <hi>good</hi> as <hi>evil</hi> reports; and that in theſe times, <hi>Fame</hi> hath been very injurious both wayes: I am therefore ſo Jealous of all ſhe <hi>blabs,</hi> eſpecially of what concerns mens <hi>Reputations,</hi> that I give not credit to any rumor without well conſidering the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> and <hi>Relators,</hi> before I receive it for truth (unleſs a fit of that <hi>Levity</hi> ſurprizes me, whereto moſt men are over prone) And as I am wary how far to believe it, ſo likewiſe I am careful to make uſe of the <hi>Truth, Falſhood</hi> or <hi>Probability</hi> thereof, ſo far forth as I can,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95695:9"/>
both to prevent my doing that injury to another, which I would not another ſhould do to me, and to render it as publickly advantagious alſo as I may without Scandal to <hi>Individual Perſons.</hi> Therefore, though <hi>Vox Populi,</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>Vox Dei,</hi> and <hi>Common Fame</hi> in ſome caſes, reputed equivolent to a <hi>Proof,</hi> my <hi>reprehenſions</hi> are always in <hi>General Terms,</hi> or at leaſt of ſo large an extent, that <hi>particular offendors,</hi> are not thereby made diſcoverable; becauſe, I have neither <hi>warrant</hi> or <hi>purpoſe,</hi> to bring men to publick <hi>ſhame</hi> or <hi>perſonal puniſhment;</hi> but to prevent it rather by giving <hi>Delinquents</hi> occaſion ſo to take notice of their own <hi>Prevarications</hi> in private, that they may eſcape both <hi>puniſhment</hi> and <hi>ſhame.</hi> If this were not my <hi>Principle,</hi> I might have mentioned many things in particular, not meanly reprovable, as well <hi>knowingly,</hi> as by <hi>Fame,</hi> whereof even <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of your Houſe</hi> are guilty; and which I might ſafely, and with a good Conſcience, have charged upon them, if I had as <hi>plain proofs</hi> to evidence it to other men, as I have to aſcertain it unto <hi>myſelf;</hi> And, to affirm this, is neither blameable in me, nor Scandal to this <hi>Houſe:</hi> For, it is no diſhonour to any <hi>Society</hi> to have it affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſome of them are corrupt or faulty. The ſoundeſt Flock may have ſome rotten Sheep; There is no <hi>natural body</hi> without a blemiſh, nor any <hi>Politick Body,</hi> or <hi>Civil Conſtitution</hi> without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.

I mention no <hi>offences,</hi> but ſuch as are known to have been committed by ſome; for, to write againſt that whereof I knew not any one to have been guilty, were to teach men <hi>new Sins</hi> by naming them, which perhaps never came into their

during my life; For my Friends being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to hazzard my health in a Lodging among common Priſoners, are compelled to pay week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as much for a poor <hi>Chamber</hi> (as would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge a years rent for a <hi>houſe with a good Farm</hi> in the Country, yet cannot have it at that dear rate, unleſs they pay likewiſe weekly for one meal a day, beſides extraordinary expences in other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, ſo much as provided me competent meat and drink five weeks, one week with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, before I came hither; which pittance did preſerve me in good health without having any other addition, to the value of a penny; and I would to God there were not many at this time more oppreſſed then I am in this kind. That expence was defrayed, alſo by Charity, which made me then ſo frugall, leſt there might be a failing thereof, as there hath been lately of what was formerly ſent in hither: perhaps, by reaſon my offence being agravated ſo much, that I being numbred and made a Companion of <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Murtherers</hi> without any difference, it hath rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome of my Friends afraid to viſit me; and for that, ſome other of them are ſo impoveriſhed that they are diſabled.</p>
            <p>I would have added no more, but conſidering, with what <hi>Malignancy</hi> ſome giddy <hi>Cenſurers</hi> have objected againſt me, the harſheſt paſſages in my <hi>Poem,</hi> without their <hi>Qualifications</hi> as aforeſaid, I cannot but be ſenſible of that influence it may have upon thoſe hearers, who ſhall never ſee the ſaid <hi>Poem</hi> in its proper dreſs, and perfected as I intended.

This being conſidered, and that I onely wrote in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate to a good end, what I had heard and partly knew (yea, and what ſome of you likewiſe and many Thouſands know to be true) I cannot juſtly be termed a <hi>Lybeller,</hi> or that <hi>Poem a Lybel.</hi> Though he who ſeized my <hi>Papers</hi> (and is or was, as I am informed the Maſter <hi>Newes Carpenter,</hi> that chips out unto us the <hi>Weekly Intelligences)</hi> hath already deemed me (as I hear alſo) to the Gallowes, and intends to endeavour what he can to prefer me thither, by publiſhing my late <hi>Poem</hi> in <hi>fragments,</hi> with his <hi>Animadverſions</hi> thereupon; I ſhall have no cauſe to be diſpleaſed thereat, if I may have Liberty to anſwer him in Publick, and be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed alſo a true Copy of the ſaid <hi>Poem.</hi>

the Conſolation and Edifying of others in <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> than to my Perſonal advantage; yea I had rather be a <hi>George on Foot,</hi> ſtiled ſimply <hi>George Wither,</hi> without any Attribute, having my ſhare in the Honour of thoſe, concerning whom it was ſaid, <hi>To you it is given to believe and ſuffer;</hi> then to be a <hi>George on horſback,</hi> honoured among thoſe <hi>Grandees,</hi> uſually Pictured riding as it were Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly on prancing Steeds, with <hi>Guilt Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi> in their hands, and the Title of <hi>Excellency,</hi> or ſuch like written under them.</p>
            <p>I have now little or no Portion in the World, but my <hi>Life,</hi> and if I ſhould ask to be delivered out of this <hi>Jayle,</hi> my <hi>Ingagements</hi> may bring me next day into another: For, I have no ſubſiſtance but their Charity, whoſe faces, or names for the moſt part, I know not; and ſhould God cauſe them totally to withdraw it (which I am confident he will not, untill he provides for me another way) I ſhall ſoon be out of every mans Power: God hath been pleaſed here to prove me, as well by <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> as by <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>Impriſonment;</hi> in ſo much, that one Twelve hours more of ſuch Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral tortures as I have ſuſtained for ſome few dayes, would totally end all my ſufferings; and I am perſwaded God (whoſe mind I deſire in all things to ſearch out ſo far forth as lawfully I may) hath lately given that ſharp touch in my Fleſh, to make me conſider how much more dreadful it would be to fall into his hands, then into the hands of Men, who cannot poſſibly inflict a greater Torment; and, that, if <hi>bodily pains</hi> may be ſo extream, how inſufferable it would be if I ſhould fall into the diſtempers of a <hi>wounded</hi> and

When I had nor <hi>Goods,</hi> nor <hi>Lands,</hi> nor <hi>Houſe</hi> left me wherein to reſt my head, nor any certain place wherein my diſtreſſed <hi>Relations</hi> might have harbor; yea, when the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Reſtraint</hi> to <hi>Poverty</hi> in this diſgraceful Priſon, had made my <hi>Children</hi> an object of ſcorn and contempt; even then, Gods merciful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence provided for them, to the wonderment and rejoycing of my Friends, by giving them in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, without <hi>Portions,</hi> to Perſons of conſiderable Eſtates and good Reputation; and made it the more conſiderable, in regard they whoſe natural affections and morral Compaſſion, he inclined thereunto, were never in their <hi>Judgements,</hi> or <hi>Intereſts</hi> united to that party with whom I was formerly ingaged: But he who makes men <hi>of one mind in a houſe,</hi> hath made nevertheleſs ſuch a loving and conſcientious harmony, in their <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> relating to a <hi>Chriſtian wel-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> that I hope it may be a ſign of a more general compoſure of differences throughout the whole <hi>Nation;</hi> and I heartily pray it may be ſo; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, by theſe and ſuch <hi>Pledges</hi> and Evidences of Gods Love, my Faith in the mean time, may be preſerved from failing, if I muſt paſs through greater <hi>Tryals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe are poſſible enough to happen in divers reſpects; For, I hear that <hi>Stigmatizing,</hi> and the

loſs of my <hi>Ears</hi> is the leaſt I ſeem to deſerve in the opinions of ſome; which though I repute it equal with the loſs of my Life, I will neither make Petition nor Friends to avoid it, by any other means but this Apology; For, I deſerve no ſuch puniſhments by Law, and if I undergo them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſert, it hath been the Lot of better men, and Gods Will be done, who will enable me to bear what he permits to befall me. Some, own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worſe Principles then I do, have ſuffered no leſs hardſhip with much courage: I have known a man in my time, to loſe his <hi>Ears,</hi> to be <hi>Stigmatized, Baniſhed,</hi> brought home again by Thouſands as it were in Triumph; Choſen to be a Member of the <hi>Higheſt Council</hi> then being, and yet to have leſs honour in his <hi>Exaltation,</hi> then he had in his <hi>Sufferings; Sic tranſit gloria mundi:</hi> Thus the Honours, Diſgraces, Bubbles, and Troubles of this Life, paſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs into that which is contrary to themſelves; and with me, all ſuch things will ſo quickly come to an end, that I think them not worthy my care. It is poſſible, that I may ſhortly be caſt into the <hi>Dungeon,</hi> ten times worſe accommodated then at preſent, There, I may be viſited alſo with bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtempers, no leſs unſufferable then thoſe I lately felt, and be left quite deſtitute of thoſe ſupplies and means of eaſement, which were then vouchſafed; for there is already a failing of that <hi>Contribution</hi> which I formerly had, and it may be much leſs, in regard it came not (that I know of) from the hands or Charity of the Lord <hi>Mayors, Sheriffes</hi> or <hi>Aldermen,</hi> within whoſe Common Priſon I am confined; nor from

any Noble or very rich Perſons; But from them onely (or for the moſt part) whoſe Charity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded their Abilities, and from ſuch (if I am not miſ-informed) whoſe certain livelihoods are ſcarce ſufficient to relieve their own wants and their neceſſities, of whom they ſeem to be more obliged to take care then of mine; and as their Number and Eſtates decreaſe by Death or Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; ſo in probability muſt my relief diminiſh: But it may partly be obſtructed by a worſe means, in regard (if I am not much deceived) there be yet ſome counterfeit Profeſſors of Piety, who having gained repute and profitable imployments here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, by their formal complying with ſuch as are ſincerely Religious, do for ſelf ends private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſperſe and diſparage their Brethren who are in affliction, to the abating of that Charity, whereby they were comforted: this way, I probably ſuſpect I may ſuffer by ſome, who inſinuate that I have not dealt ſo candedly as I ought to have done with them; whereas they abounding in their own ſence, have not only been unreaſonable in their demands and expectations, but palpably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious alſo unto me and mine: But my Eſſential reputation depends on what is really in my ſelf, not on other mens Tongues; and theſe devourers of Widowes houſes, under the colour of long Prayers, have alwayes been as much my Enemies and Traducers, as they who are openly prophane; of which two ſorts there are ſo many who make it their work to aſperſe me, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of envy, malice, or ſelf intreſt, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not long eſcape their Evil Tongues; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I may now ſuffer in the opinion of this <hi>Houſe,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:95695:18"/>
by the miſrepreſentations of ſuch Perſons, as I have done heretofore.</p>
            <p>But I being Experimentally acquainted with Gods diſpenſations as to <hi>giving,</hi> and <hi>taking away;</hi> do find their may be as juſt cauſe at this time, of <hi>taking away</hi> as of <hi>giving</hi> (leaſt my corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being prone enough thereto) I might more depend upon my own ſtrength, or upon Gods gifts, or upon thoſe by whom he ſends them, then upon him from whom they came. <hi>God Alſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> by <hi>adding</hi> and <hi>withdrawing,</hi> keeps me both from <hi>diſpair,</hi> and <hi>preſumption.</hi> I find moreover, that not onely the ſeizure of my <hi>Papers,</hi> hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced my Primary intention, but that every hardſhip alſo which hath hapned thereupon to my Perſon, hath advantaged me; For, I who was heretofore ſerved with nigh twenty ſervants in houſhold at once, can now ſerve many <hi>hard Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> and my ſelf too, with more contentment then in thoſe dayes. I have by <hi>looſing,</hi> gained ſomewhat toward my ſupport; found ſomewhat which lay hid <hi>within me,</hi> to make a mends for what is defective <hi>without me,</hi> and can do many things for my ſelf, which I never did heretofore; mend my Cloaths, make my Bed, my Sea-coal Fires, &amp; ſweep my Chamber, as well as any ſervant in the Jayle, and make the doing of theſe things a pleaſing recreation. I may poſſibly be detained in Priſon until I muſt lie in a lowſie Bed, or upon the bare ground, but whilſt I am here I ſhall ſtill have the <hi>Walls</hi> and <hi>roofs</hi> of a Priſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me from the cold Air; whereas, if I ſhould Petition to be delivered hence, and obtain my requeſt, without being ſome way provided for, I
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95695:19"/>
know not at this preſent any place wherein I can be certain to find ſo much ſhelter as I have here; in regard, my ſon in whoſe Chamber at the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> I had harbor, till I was from thence commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was lately conſtrained to ſell it to diſcharge a debt of mine, for which he ſtood ingaged; and this being conſidered with many other things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, I know not what to ask of you for my ſelf. Excuſe this <hi>Verboſity;</hi> For, old men (eſpecially when oppreſſed) are full of words; Loſers alſo (as our Proverb ſaith) may be allowed to ſpeak; and though much of what I expreſſe may ſeem impertinent both to my Vindication, and to you, yet for many reſpects it will he pertinent to me, and to many more, when you have laid them aſide (or ſhall neglect them) even to many of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People who are both your <hi>Servants</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi> For, I have not ſcribled all this, and inlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with many Collateral Expreſſions, ſo much to Vindicate my ſelf, as in hope my Experiments in this ſuffering, may be of comfortable uſe now or hereafter, to ſome of thoſe whom you repreſent. And, in truth, my Apollogizing for my tediouſneſs now I ſeriouſly heed it, is but a needleſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent mannerlineſs, according to the Common mode; for, it cannot be juſtly expected, that to the interrupting of <hi>Publick affairs,</hi> a diſcourſe of this length ſhould be read in your <hi>Houſe;</hi> nor had I any ſuch hope, though I directed it to the whole <hi>Houſe,</hi> to intreſt every individual Member thereof in my <hi>Cauſe,</hi> when his will and leaſure ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to incline him; well knowing, that were it <hi>longer,</hi> or <hi>ſhorter,</hi> it will be totally peruſed by ſome of you, out of a Conſcientious regard of my
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95695:19"/>
               <hi>ſufferings;</hi> by ſome others, out of curioſity; by others, for their information touching thoſe matters which may be thereby diſcovered relating to themſelves, or the <hi>Publick;</hi> and, perhaps, by more then a few with a deſire to find out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what therein, which may give them occaſion to add to my affliction.</p>
            <p>But, I may treſpaſs againſt your patience more through my <hi>tediouſneſs,</hi> in ſomewhat that I have yet to ſay, by occaſion of that <hi>Publick Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which is injoyned by his Majeſties <hi>Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> the ſincere Solemnization whereof, will be another incitement to <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that which is moſt Eſſential to ſuch Duties, is <hi>Relieving</hi> the <hi>Oppreſſed,</hi> the <hi>Widow,</hi> the <hi>Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi> and letting the <hi>Priſoners</hi> go free, next unto thoſe <hi>Offices</hi> which are to be performed immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God. It hath ſuddenly Surprized me, and though it ſeem not to belong to my matter in hand, it will be of ſuch concernment, that I cannot forbear in this place to inſert it; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it pertinent to this <hi>Generation,</hi> and my <hi>work</hi> therein; which being almoſt at an end, I will upon the ſaid occaſion, leave with you who are the <hi>Repreſentative</hi> of this <hi>Nation,</hi> ſome <hi>hints</hi> and <hi>Cautions,</hi> fit to be taken into conſideration by you and them, at this time, in reſpect of that ſaid <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Humiliation;</hi> Therefore that my words may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be worthy of ſo much regard, at leaſt, as thoſe which were ſpoken to <hi>Baalam</hi> by his beaſt, I pray be pleaſed, though I ſeem a <hi>Phannatick,</hi> to take notice that above a hundred of my <hi>Preſages</hi> and <hi>Preconjectures</hi> heretofore publiſhed, &amp; tending to the <hi>Common welfare</hi> (during the ſeveral changes
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95695:20"/>
of <hi>Governours</hi> and <hi>Governments,</hi> ſince I came to years of diſcretion) have been evidently verified; and ſome in particulars touching the prophanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and abuſe of <hi>Publick Humiliations</hi> and <hi>Thanſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings;</hi> and for which Impieties, and Hypocriſie, thoſe <hi>Plagues</hi> were increaſed, from which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be delivered, or other <hi>Judgements</hi> brought upon us. It was too evident that for the moſt part, there was more <hi>Policy</hi> then <hi>Piety,</hi> in the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of <hi>Publick Faſts</hi> and <hi>Thankſgivings</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore; the firſt, being perhaps to delude People by a ſhew of <hi>Holineſs,</hi> to make them the more willing to contribute ſupplies and aſſiſtance to their <hi>Deſigns;</hi> and the latter to incourage their <hi>Friends,</hi> diſhearten their <hi>Enemies,</hi> or to Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their own <hi>Victories</hi> and <hi>Prevailings,</hi> rather then to glorifie God; And the <hi>lean Calves</hi> of their Lips, which they then offered, were far inferiour to the <hi>Hecatombs</hi> and magnificent Sacrifices of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in preceding Ages. <hi>Oliver Crumwell,</hi> about, or little before the beginning of his laſt year, commanded a day of <hi>Humiliation</hi> to be So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized, with a pretence to ſeek God for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of a great <hi>Mortality</hi> then raging, as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; within a Month after that, he injoyned a <hi>Publick Thankſgiving,</hi> with a pretence to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God for his two moſt <hi>Signal Victories;</hi> at which times, I prepared and made bold to preſent to his own hands, <hi>Hints,</hi> to remember him of ſuch <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Duties</hi> as I feared he might neglect, peradventure not without cauſe; For, no effects followed anſwerable to thoſe <hi>Pious pretendings;</hi> and on the very day Twelve Month next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his day of <hi>Humiliation</hi> to take away <hi>Sickneſs;</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:95695:20"/>
he himſelf ſickned to death; and within a few weeks after that, even upon the ſame day Twelve Moneth alſo, which he ſet a part for a <hi>Publick Thanksgiving,</hi> he died of the aforeſaid <hi>Sickneſ;</hi> which I take the more notice of, becauſe, I find at the concluſion of the laſt <hi>Addreſſe,</hi> which I prepared for the ſaid two <hi>Solemn dayes,</hi> theſe few lines;</p>
            <q>
               <l>Sir, I have now perform'd my true endeavour,</l>
               <l>If, nothing it prevails; Farewell for ever:</l>
               <l>For, you, or I, or both, ſhall be ere long,</l>

            <p>God give a better ſucceſs to our <hi>Devotions,</hi> then in dayes paſt; but I do yet ſee very ſmall appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances thereof, for, the beſt <hi>Sign</hi> at preſent that God will at laſt deliver us from the <hi>Judgement</hi> now lying upon us, and avert thoſe which we fear, is this; that <hi>he removes them not before we truly repent:</hi> I hear we have the ſame <hi>Animoſſities,</hi> and the ſame <hi>Avengeful ſpirits</hi> amongſt us: I hear, the cryes of the Widow, Fatherleſs and oppreſſed, are as loud and lamentable as ever; That <hi>Priſons</hi> are ſtill as full, not onely of miſerable decayed Debtors, but, alſo crammed up as it were, to the deſtruction of many mens lives, or healths, with Perſons who ſuffer meerly upon the groundleſs Jealouſies, and pretended Suſpitions of malicious informers; and few take their Oppreſſions and ſtarving condition into conſideration. <hi>Poverty</hi> by <hi>Oppreſſions,</hi> and new <hi>Oppreſſions</hi> by <hi>Poverty,</hi> are become ſo <hi>Epedimical</hi> and <hi>Univerſal,</hi> that no Hiſtory can ſhew us that there ever were in the <hi>ſame Land</hi> (where no <hi>War</hi> did then rage) ſo many
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95695:21"/>
thouſands of the ſame <hi>Nation,</hi> made beggarly and miſerable by each other; even by their <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,</hi> their former Familiars, their <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Brethren</hi> and <hi>Kinſmen;</hi> or, where there was at ſo neceſſitous a time, ſo much <hi>Luxury, Pride</hi> and exceſſive bravery in apparrel. And the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates of the <hi>man of Sin,</hi> do ſo endeavour alſo to root out their <hi>oppoſers,</hi> by whom the <hi>Peace of God</hi> ſhould be preſerved among us; and have ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed <hi>Prophaneſs, Impiety,</hi> and <hi>Superſtition,</hi> that, though many now think this <hi>Nation</hi> in a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Eſtate, and near to a Glorious <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> in their Mode; the World ſeems unto me, rather nigh to ſuch a <hi>Judgement</hi> as <hi>Noahs Flood;</hi> or, theſe <hi>Nations,</hi> by their paralelling them in their ſins, not to be far from ſomewhat reſembling that which befell to <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> unleſs God ſhall prevent it, for the ſake of his <hi>Elect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Give me leave therefore (who ſhall probably never hereafter be troubleſome again in this kind) to declare freely and fully what I believe God declares unto my heart, by bringing an <hi>Examplary Judgement</hi> of his to my remembrance, recorded in the 21. Chapter of the ſecond Book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> which I am hopeful may opperate ſomewhat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well conſidered, toward the aſſwaging of that <hi>blood-thirſtineſs,</hi> and toward purging away that <hi>blood-guiltineſs,</hi> which lies yet upon us; For, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the <hi>blood</hi> already ſhed, I do perceive that not onely many men, who are no wayes in their particular Perſons or Intreſt, damnified by thoſe who are queſtioned for ſhedding blood, have an unquenchable thirſt after more blood; but, that Women alſo, who are naturally tender hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95695:21"/>
are ſo inflamed with that thirſt (if we may know their diſtempers by their words) as if the <hi>Death</hi> of others were half the <hi>Life</hi> of their Souls; and as if they had never heard, who hath given it forth to be the <hi>Mark</hi> of <hi>Whoriſh Women,</hi> to hunt after the precious lives of men. I heard ſince this Text came into my thought, that you had a Sermon Preached before you, upon the ſame parſel of <hi>Scripture,</hi> on the late day of <hi>Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> but I have not yet ſeen it, nor heard what Application or Uſe he hath made thereof; when you have heard me, try the Spirits by which we are guided; for, I will declare my ſelf imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally without reſpect of Perſons, according to that <hi>Light</hi> within me, which beameth from the <hi>Light Eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the dayes of <hi>David,</hi> there was a <hi>Famine</hi> three years throughout the Land; whereupon, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of God the cauſe of that <hi>Plague,</hi> received anſwer, that it was for <hi>Saul</hi> and his <hi>bloody houſe,</hi> who had ſlain the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> a remnant of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> unto whom the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſworn; yet, (as it is added in the Text) <hi>Saul</hi> thought to ſlay them, out of a Zeal to the children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi> From this <hi>Record,</hi> and the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,</hi> I do undoubtedly collect, that <hi>Famine</hi> is a <hi>Judgement,</hi> proper to the avenging of <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Bloodſhed;</hi> and in reaſon it ſo appears to be; For as <hi>Blood</hi> is the Life of men, ſo the <hi>Fruits of the Earth</hi> are the Life and preſervation of <hi>humane Blood;</hi> and therefore juſtly taken away from thoſe, who are guilty of that Sin. A <hi>Famine</hi> is now begun among us, likely to increaſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, unleſs we make our Attonement and Peace
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95695:22"/>
with God; which the <hi>King</hi> taking into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to the Duty of his Place, ſtrictly commanded all his People to ſeek unto Almighty God for pardon of our ſins, by a General and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned <hi>Humiliation;</hi> wherein he <hi>Chriſtianly</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that <hi>he</hi> and his whole <hi>Family</hi> ſhould ſo joyn, that we might altogether as one man hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves in his preſence, in hope our <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions</hi> might be accepted; and, I ſhall be glad if it hath been ſo performed, leſt elſe, it ſo provoke God, that inſtead of removing and preventing a deſtructive <hi>Dearth,</hi> it bring upon us, all his three <hi>great Plagues</hi> at once, doubled; even <hi>Wars, Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> and <hi>Famines,</hi> both Spiritual and Temporal. Let us take heed of it; And ſince <hi>Bloodſhed</hi> is the principal crime, for which the <hi>Judgement</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begun is feared will increaſe, and for the expiation whereof ſome ſatisfaction muſt be made, to witneſs the truth of our <hi>Repentance,</hi> (though it be not in our Power to make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the leaſt Tranſgreſſion) let us all be ſo cautious to ſearch into <hi>the whole matter,</hi> and to find out every Circumſtance of our <hi>Duties;</hi> that we add not <hi>Sin</hi> to <hi>Sin, Blood</hi> to <hi>Blood,</hi> and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we do well, when we have done more wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, by an hypocritical miſapplication, or an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant ſearch. Or, leaſt in place of true Chriſtian <hi>Oblations,</hi> we offer up the abominations of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> who ſacrificed the <hi>Innocent</hi> Children of their <hi>Enemies,</hi> to appeaſe the Ghoſts of their ſlaughtered <hi>Princes;</hi> or, do like them, who offered the Fruits of their <hi>Body</hi> to <hi>Molech,</hi> for the ſins of their <hi>Souls;</hi> Or, leſt we think, as many have done, we do <hi>God</hi> or our <hi>Country</hi> good ſervice, when we
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95695:22"/>
have oppreſſed, or ſlain, or baniſhed, thoſe who worſhip him not as we do; even thoſe, for whoſe ſakes we are hitherto preſerved, by him, in whoſe ſight the Blood of the <hi>meaneſt of his Saints,</hi> is more precious then the Blood of the <hi>greateſt King,</hi> who hath not aſwell a <hi>Saintſhip</hi> as <hi>Kingſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Expiation therefore of our <hi>Blood-guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> ſo far forth as it will be requirable to teſtifie the ſincerity of our <hi>Contrition</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> (plenary ſatisfaction as I ſaid before, not being in our Power) we muſt effectually and ſpeedily proſecute the <hi>means,</hi> which are but two in chief. The one is, the waſhing away of wilful <hi>Bloodſhed,</hi> with the blood of <hi>malicious Murtherers,</hi> by Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting <hi>Juſtice.</hi> The other is by <hi>Mercy,</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning thoſe who have ſhed Blood <hi>cauſually, ignorautly,</hi> and without any apparant <hi>malice;</hi> And, this <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> muſt be diſpenſed without partiality, raſhneſs, malice, or by-reſpect to our <hi>ſelves,</hi> or to any other. That, we be not deceived in the <hi>Perſons</hi> who are to be the Objects of this <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> we muſt be very wary leaſt we incur the curſe pronounced againſt them, who <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the wicked and condemn the Innocent;</hi> ſo, in ſtead of being rendred acceptable, become abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable unto the Lord; For, the <hi>World</hi> is ſo full of deceitful <hi>Juglings,</hi> that, ſhe can make that which is <hi>Righteous</hi> and <hi>Holy,</hi> appear to be <hi>unrighteous</hi> and <hi>prophane:</hi> wrap up <hi>Suparlative Impietie</hi> in ſuch a <hi>Myſtery,</hi> that, it ſhall ſeem the Perfection of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> make <hi>Traytors</hi> and <hi>Murtherers</hi> appear to be <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> true <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> to be reputed <hi>Murtherers,</hi> and <hi>Traytors;</hi> and bring them to the greateſt outward ſhame and ſuffering.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95695:23"/>
Therefore to prevent theſe <hi>Falacies,</hi> we muſt by the example of <hi>David,</hi> ſeek of God, to be rightly informed, not onely as touching the true <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Plagues</hi> that are feared, or lie upon us, but alſo for the <hi>Principal Offenders;</hi> for, if we ſeek but to <hi>men,</hi> to <hi>humane Lawes,</hi> and reaſon, and to what our own hearts will Dictate, there is ſo much falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in all theſe, being uſually ſwayed by <hi>Self-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſts,</hi> that we may eaſily be deceived.</p>
            <p>If inquiry had been made in <hi>Davids</hi> time, touching the <hi>Famine</hi> afore mentioned, of that part of the People, then of <hi>Sauls Faction,</hi> who were the Murtherers, for whoſe <hi>Bloodſhed</hi> that <hi>Plague</hi> was inflicted; they, probably would have anſwered, that it was for the bloodineſs of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> houſe, and of his <hi>confederates,</hi> who had Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly diſinherited the true apparent Heir of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> Anoynted and made King by Gods own appointment, with conſent of all the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> and that his <hi>Blood-guiltineſs</hi> was manifeſt by a long Rebellious warfare againſt the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> his <hi>Lawful Soveraign.</hi> If the ſame queſtion ſhould have been then asked of <hi>Davids Party,</hi> it is likely they would have ſaid, that <hi>Saul</hi> and his <hi>partakers</hi> were the Murtherers by ſhedding blood in oppoſing him, to whom God had tranſlated the <hi>Kingdom</hi> from <hi>Saul,</hi> for his diſobedience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred it on <hi>David</hi> by the ſame <hi>Anointing,</hi> by the ſame <hi>Prophet,</hi> who inaugurated <hi>Saul;</hi> and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the <hi>Kingdom</hi> was alſo confirmed upon <hi>David,</hi> by conſent of the ſame <hi>People.</hi> If the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in theſe dayes, had been conſulted with all, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps would have thought and ſaid, that it had been, for the Blood of thoſe <hi>Prieſts of the Lord,</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:95695:23"/>
which were barbarouſly Butchered by <hi>Saul,</hi> rather then for the blood of the <hi>Gibeonites;</hi> and, it may be they and many other (who uſually Judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to common appearances) would have thought that <hi>Famine</hi> had been inflicted for the blood of <hi>Abner, Iſhboſheth, Amaſa, Ammon, Uriah,</hi> and many other, as well as for the blood of the ſaid <hi>Prieſts.</hi> But, the <hi>Judgement</hi> came not forth at that time for any of theſe; It was not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely for ſhedding of meer Innocent blood; nor for <hi>Blood Royal,</hi> or eſteemed Sacred; no not for the blood of a <hi>King,</hi> but for Blood ſhed by a <hi>King;</hi> and for no ſuch precious blood as the blood of <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> or <hi>Friends,</hi> or <hi>Free Subjects,</hi> but for the <hi>Blood of ſlaves,</hi> of whom little account was made; and for breach of an <hi>Oath,</hi> and a <hi>Covenant</hi> to and with deſpiſed Perſons, though contracted <hi>Illegally,</hi> yea, contrary to Gods <hi>expreſſe command,</hi> with a People whom they were to have deſtroyed; and though, it had been fraudulently and ſurreptiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly procured: which <hi>Exemplary Judgement,</hi> was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and left upon record, to make it known to all <hi>Nations,</hi> and <hi>Generations,</hi> how abominable it is to God, when men violate the Lawes of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society,</hi> though out of a pretended Zeal to the welfare of his <hi>own People;</hi> and, that he will ſooner diſpence with an <hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> made ignorantly, contrary to his own <hi>expreſſe command,</hi> then with violation thereof, in ſuch a caſe, when it is once made; and, that, neither length of time, or Pious, or Politick pretences, can incline him to leave it unpuniſhed.</p>

               <hi>Nation,</hi> as touching that <hi>Bloodſhed</hi> into which God is making inquiſition; &amp; concerning which we are to make inquity of <hi>God</hi> himſelf, by the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim</hi> of his <hi>Word;</hi> as alſo, by impartially ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining our own <hi>Conſciences,</hi> leſt the <hi>falſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> which the World &amp; ſelf intreſt may ſuborn, corrupt our Judgements: For, if we ask of our <hi>meer Courtiers,</hi> or <hi>Fawning Paraſites</hi> (who think there is more Divinity in the blood of <hi>Kings</hi> then of other men) whoſe <hi>Bloodſhed</hi> is at this time pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable by <hi>Famine,</hi> they (as I conceive) will tell us, that it is onely for the Blood of the <hi>late King,</hi> which I believe not, though there lies a <hi>blood-guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs</hi> for that, on very many. If we ask of the <hi>Prelates,</hi> they peradventure will add thereto the blood of the late Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the violence done to their <hi>Hyerachie.</hi> If we ask the reſt of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> they wil caſt in the blood of thoſe <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel,</hi> who have been ſlain by the Sword, are deſtroyed by Oppreſſion: The <hi>Peers</hi> will ſay it is likewiſe for the Blood of ſome of the <hi>Nobility:</hi> If we put the Queſtion to the <hi>Generality</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> they will affirm, that it was for the blood of their <hi>Parents, Children, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> and <hi>fellow Subjects.</hi> If we demand the opinion of the Papiſts, they will anſwer, that it is for the blood of their <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites.</hi> If we Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> they unanimouſly cry out and ſay, that it is for the blood of thoſe three hundred ſixty and odd Thouſands, who were in a moſt Treacherous and Barbarous manner Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by the Papiſts: If we think by our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Parliaments,</hi> to be rightly informed, they (not being infallible) will leave us as doubtful as

the reſt; For, <hi>Laws</hi> contradict each other; one <hi>Parliament</hi> Enacts that for Law, which another makes Illegal; and that to be <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Treaſon,</hi> which we are enjoyned by another <hi>Parliament</hi> to embrace for Orthodox <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Loyalty; Hocus Pocus!</hi> ſo, that if we had no better <hi>Oracle</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire at, then theſe aforementioned, we may add <hi>blood</hi> to <hi>blood,</hi> by puniſhing <hi>Innocents</hi> as <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,</hi> and Juſtifying <hi>Malifactors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In truth a <hi>Blood-guiltineſs,</hi> more or leſs, in all theſe reſpects, lies upon ſome of all diſſenting <hi>Parties</hi> throughout the whole <hi>Nation;</hi> yea upon all without excepting one perſon, though they perceive it not; and a greater <hi>blood-guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> then the blood-ſhed of all thoſe put together will amount unto; even a <hi>guiltineſs</hi> of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> and his <hi>Saints,</hi> by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing them, not onely in depriving them of their Liberties and Eſtates (whereby <hi>Life</hi> is to be preſerved) until they loſe their lives more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably then by a <hi>quick murther;</hi> but, by Tyraniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over their <hi>Conſciences</hi> alſo, to the deſtroying of their ſouls, if God prevent not. Unleſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will heed, and weigh this <hi>guilt,</hi> and ſanctifie out formal Humiliations with more works of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> then heretofore, they will prove <hi>empty vanities,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> without Salt or Oyl. And, when we have according to <hi>Davids Example,</hi> duely ſearched out the <hi>Sin</hi> for which God hath begun to puniſh us (which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably is <hi>Bloodſhed</hi> in chief) the ſame <hi>blood-guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> will continue upon this <hi>Nation,</hi> until as far as in us lies, we ſhall proportionably apply what is juſtly deſerved by the <hi>Principal, acceſſary</hi> and

               <hi>cauſual Tranſgreſſors;</hi> putting difference between them according to the quality and degree of their offences; ſeeing ſome of thoſe who have been accuſed and condemned, may poſſibly be as far from being guilty of <hi>Bloodſhed,</hi> or <hi>Treaſon, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly or intentionally,</hi> as they who went with <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi> in the ſimplicity of their hearts to a ſacrifice, when he rebelled againſt his <hi>father;</hi> and as <hi>guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> of wilful <hi>Treaſon,</hi> as the <hi>Prieſt</hi> was, who gave the <hi>Shewbread</hi> to <hi>David</hi> and his Souldiers when pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by <hi>Saul.</hi> Two men may be Active in the ſame work, grinding at the ſame Mill, fight in the ſame Cauſe, at one and the ſame <hi>Battle,</hi> and yet one of them be juſtly excuſed and received to mercy, the other as juſtly rejected. And when the matter is doubtful, we muſt labour to our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, to find out the <hi>certainty,</hi> inclining rather to <hi>compaſſion</hi> then to extream <hi>Rigor</hi> in ſuch ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; elſe we do neither according to the mind of God, nor make our ſelves to be ſo capable of his <hi>mercy</hi> as we may. <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſed us not to be over juſt, that is, not to execute any <hi>Juſtice</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>mercy.</hi> The very <hi>mercies</hi> of the wicked are cruel, much more cruel then is their <hi>Juſtice.</hi> They who think they expreſſe much love and Loyalty to the King, or to do him the more honour, by how much the more blood they ſhed to avenge his <hi>Fathers Death,</hi> do more diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and diſhonour him thereby, then they who took away his <hi>Life,</hi> as it will be manifeſt at the laſt. The Indulgence of <hi>David</hi> to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who rebelled with his ſon <hi>Abſalom,</hi> doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that a difference ſhould be put between of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders according to the degree and nature of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95695:25"/>
their offence, as did alſo the Cities of <hi>Refuge</hi> for <hi>man-ſlaughter;</hi> The <hi>Jews,</hi> who were guilty of the blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the King of Kings, (as <hi>Paul</hi> was alſo by Perſecuting the <hi>Saints)</hi> were capable of Divine Mercy in regard they did it meerly through ignorance, and by being invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the <hi>Epidemical Sin</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> at that time; So, may many be at this preſent: And our King (if I am not miſinformed) is ſo naturally inclined to extend compaſſion to ſuch offenders, that probably the iſſue of <hi>Blood,</hi> had been here ſtopt long ſince, if he had not been urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to more ſeverity then he is inclined unto. And, doubleſs, they who ſubmitted unto His late <hi>Proclamation,</hi> (which threatned that no mercy ſhould be vouchſafed unto them, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſurrendred not their Perſons) were not ſo mad, as to come in with a purpoſe to be hang'd, ſeeing they might as poſſibly have ſecured their lives by flight as others have yet done; But, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Conſciences clear (as I ſuppoſe) from having had any malicious intention in thoſe tranſactions wherein they were judged offenders; they ſurrendred themſelves into the Kings hands, with a belief that their Indempnity was ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended by the ſaid <hi>Proclamation,</hi> upon their ſubmiſſion; ſeeing elſe, it had either ſignified no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as to them, or, ſomwhat <hi>worſe then nothing,</hi> to delude them with a falſe hope; which to believe, were ſuch a Derogation from the Kings honour, as I am not guilty of; and I am perſwaded he is ſo ſenſible how much it may concern him, that he will not deſtroy the hope which was begotten
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95695:26"/>
by his own voluntary Act of Clemency. I my ſelf, (as, it may be, ſome other were) though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged heretofore with ſuch as oppoſed the <hi>Royal Intereſt,</hi> was even then, as far from intending any thing maliciouſly againſt the Kings Perſon or Dignity, that I truly pittied his eſtate; And ſo God proſper me, as I would gladly have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted what was in my power toward his <hi>Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or the ſetling of him in a ſafe and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able being, if I had then known how to have done it, without reſiſting God, or infringing that <hi>fidelity</hi> to which I conceived, I was then obliged; For which reſpect, I do verily believe, I may now claim an intereſt in all his Majeſties Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Acts of Grace,</hi> notwithſtanding my former <hi>Miſpriſions:</hi> And that according to his Royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Ingagements voluntarily made, I may juſtly expect, at leaſt a competent ſubſiſtance for me and my Family, out of that eſtate, which I purchaſed and poſſeſſed, before his <hi>Reſtoration:</hi> For, he is not more ſafe in any mans profeſſed <hi>Allegiance</hi> or <hi>Principles,</hi> then in mine; who am probably perſwaded in my heart to believe, that after he hath tryed the temper of his People, God will put into his heart a deſire and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to declare and proſecute ſomewhat, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily tending to his Glory, and to the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating of the fears, hopes and expectations of many thouſands, who are now oppoſites in their <hi>Judgements</hi> and <hi>Affections:</hi> Nothing, but a mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious wickedneſs can ſuperſede this <hi>Mercy.</hi> It is a more manly <hi>Principle</hi> to ruine men ſpeedily and outright in fury, then by diſſembling an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Mercy</hi> to linger out their Torments, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95695:26"/>
deſtroy them at the laſt; of which cruelty, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Prelates</hi> to be leſs guilty at this time, then many other by whom we ſuffer; For, they are, for the moſt part, ſo true to their <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Avarice,</hi> that they devour us as quickly as they can, without masking or hiding their Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Let there be ſincerity therefore, in executing <hi>Juſtice</hi> and extending <hi>Mercy;</hi> and let us know and heed this to a <hi>maxime,</hi> which ought undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to be received; to wit, that if any <hi>King, Supream Power, Prince, Commander in chief,</hi> or any other by them Authoritatively deputed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence their <hi>Mercy,</hi> or other <hi>Priviledges</hi> or <hi>Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> or of <hi>right due,</hi> ſhall, by his or their <hi>Declaration, Proclamation, Letter, Promiſe</hi> or <hi>Ingagement,</hi> make tender of them voluntarily to any real or ſuſpected <hi>Delinquents,</hi> (without any capitulation or conditions) actually inſiſted on by the ſaid <hi>Delinquents</hi> (eſpecially the ſaid <hi>Granters</hi> receiving benefit afterwards thereby) If theſe <hi>Delinquents</hi> accept thereof, ſubmit, and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into their Protection, without queſtoning the terms of expreſſion, or the ſincerity of the ſaid Granters intentions; Then, the ſaid Conceſſions are to be conſtrued to the utmoſt advantage of them, who ſo confided and ſubmitted. And, if in ſuch caſes there ſhall be any ſecret <hi>Reſerve</hi> or <hi>Intention</hi> in the ſaid <hi>Granters,</hi> whereby they who ſo abſolutely confided, ſhall be deprived of their <hi>hope;</hi> or if there be any explicite or <hi>equivocal terme</hi> therein, whereby the <hi>Grace</hi> hoped for, may be vacated, by the future Judgement of the ſaid <hi>Granters,</hi> or of other men, who are apparent
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95695:27"/>
Enemies, or doubtful Friends to the <hi>Granters;</hi> it will be ſo evident an Injuſtice, ſo ignoble, and ſo Hypocritical a <hi>Prevarication,</hi> that, what <hi>Reaſon of State</hi> ſoever is pretended, it will be abominable to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Men:</hi> The ſaid <hi>Granters,</hi> will juſtly loſe their honour both <hi>abroad</hi> and at <hi>home;</hi> none will confide in their <hi>Grants, Promiſes</hi> or <hi>Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> for the future, and <hi>Divine Vengeance</hi> will alſo perſue them. This may perhaps be diſtaſtful to them who relliſh not ſuch <hi>aſſertions;</hi> But, he who truely fears God, and declares <hi>neceſſary Truths</hi> in ſeaſon with a good Conſcience, needs not fear <hi>men,</hi> how furious or powerful ſoever they be; For, they will be afraid of him, if his Aſſertions be of God.</p>
            <p>Moreover, let us take notice, that we ſhall neither be freed from the <hi>Judgement</hi> threatned, nor clear from the guilt of <hi>bloodſhed</hi> paſt, unleſs we proſecute every <hi>medium</hi> in our Power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <hi>bloodſhed to come,</hi> by taking away the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of malicious <hi>Animoſities</hi> which foment <hi>diſcord,</hi> the Uſher to <hi>Murthers</hi> and <hi>Rebellions:</hi> And this will never be effected in meer <hi>Morral</hi> or <hi>Carnal Men,</hi> but by executing of <hi>Juſtice</hi> between Man and Man without partiallity, and by permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to enjoy their Liberties and Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, according to Law, without Oppreſſions; For, it being their <hi>Life-Blood,</hi> they will ſtruggle for it, upon all advantages (though it be by <hi>blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed)</hi> let <hi>Divines,</hi> Preach what they will, and <hi>Stateſ-men</hi> threaten &amp; impoſe, whatſoever Oaths and other manacles they can deviſe; yea, though they loſe <hi>Liberty, Eſtate, Life, Body</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> to recover it; Becauſe they cannot be made
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95695:27"/>
ſo ſenſible of any thing, as of their <hi>Self-Intereſt</hi> and <hi>preſent wants;</hi> So, that, if their diſtempers be not aſſwaged, by the means aforeſaid, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>blood-guiltineſs</hi> will ſtill continue; And as for them who being by <hi>regeneration</hi> made ſo conſcientious of yielding <hi>Active</hi> or <hi>Paſſive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> to the Commands of <hi>Authority,</hi> that, they will ſuffer any thing rather then reſiſt to blood, though they loſe all that whereby the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their life-blood conſiſteth (and are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to greater ſufferings, then by a ſpeedy Murther) they will make the <hi>Land</hi> lyable to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>blood-guiltineſs,</hi> and more dreadful <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> then the former: Becauſe, at laſt, it will provoke God for the ſakes of thoſe <hi>Patient Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents,</hi> to ariſe from his Throne in Heaven and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to be their avenger. This, I am warranted to declare; therefore conſider it; <hi>Reaſon</hi> is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and <hi>Truth</hi> Truth, though ſpoken by <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Children;</hi> The greateſt Perſons if they deſpiſe it, ſhall be deſpiſed; and the wiſeſt, if they ſlight it, are Fools.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to enjoy the <hi>Peace of GOD,</hi> or long to preſerve the <hi>Civil Peace,</hi> without other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while giving an occaſion of <hi>Bloodſhed,</hi> when the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of men are intrenched upon, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that which is deſtructive to their <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Freedom</hi> in things indifferent; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when they perceive them to be impoſed for ſuperſtitious ends onely, and to advance the covetuous deſignes and Intereſt of corrupt <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> in <hi>Societies:</hi> For, though they who are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely conſcientious, will (as I ſaid before) ſuffer any thing rather then give a juſt occaſion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95695:28"/>
or act ought whereby the Civil Peace may be violated; yet, it is ſo abominable to meer Natural and Moral men, to ſee an unlawful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt upheld and indulged, under pretences of promo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Among other things conſiderable in that kinde, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of meats on certain dayes and times, makes many very ſenſible, how impudently they have been fooled out of their Freedoms by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Impoſtors. For, though it be reaſonable that the forbearing of <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the eating of Fiſh at ſometimes ſhould be enjoyned, for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the breed of Cattle, or ſuch like reſpects; and that neither the <hi>Fiſhing Trade</hi> may be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, nor that bleſſing of abundance of Fiſh, ſeem to be deſpiſed, wherewith God hath plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully furniſhed theſe <hi>Ilands:</hi> yet, who can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what prudence or <hi>Pietie</hi> it is, that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to an <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> Principle (which was introduced as it were in deſpight of what God hath declared in his <hi>Word)</hi> thoſe <hi>meats</hi> ſhould be judged unlawful, on ſome dayes in a Religious reſpect, which being Sanctified by Prayer and Thankſgiving, may be eaten at all times without offence to God? If there be no thing of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſuch a <hi>Reſtraint,</hi> why ſhould it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as pertinent to Religion, and managed by <hi>Officers</hi> thereto pretending? If the obſervation of a <hi>Lent,</hi> be not as truely a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> as a <hi>Chriſtian Diſcipline,</hi> or Ceremony, Let us know by what <hi>Holy Text,</hi> it is commanded, equivolent to that Authority, whereby that, and ſuch like Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

And, if, indeed it be of Divine Inſtitution, let it then be conſidered, what an abominable hypocriſie &amp; abuſe it is of that Diſcipline, that the <hi>Prelates,</hi> their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars or other Officers, or Doctor Dodipol, with ſuch like Perſons ſhould make a ſordid gain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to ſatisfie their Covetouſneſs? diſpence with this Liberty to whomſoever they pleaſe for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; even to thoſe who deſire it, meerly to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their <hi>Luxurius Appetite?</hi> taking that Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom alſo to themſelves, by licenſing each other to eat <hi>Fleſh,</hi> when prohibited? If a <hi>poor-man</hi> be ſo ſick, that he cannot eat Fiſh without hazzard of his life, or hath ſuch an Antipathie thereunto that it alwayes indangers his health to eat it; why ſhould his life or health be put into the hands of ſuch Perſons who regard nothing ſo much as their <hi>Self-Intereſt?</hi> what Religion or Charity is it to make this man pay money for it? Is it not affliction enough that he hath ſuch infirmities, unleſs he ſhall be inforced alſo to add unto his Poverty, by paying for that Liberty to ſome Shab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Fellow, which God beſtowed freely upon him? yea, to pay for it to one perhaps, who whilſt he is Faſting, will conſume in Feaſting, that which he exacted? were it not more <hi>Chriſtian</hi> like (if ſuch a <hi>Reſtraint</hi> be civilly neceſſary) that ſober honeſt and faithful men, ſhould take the money given for ſuch Licenſes to help relieve the ſick and needy in neceſitous times? yea, if it be expedient for a publick benefit, that there ſhould be a reſtraint from eating Fleſh at ſome ſet times (as I believe it may be, if ordered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true intention of our Lawes) It
