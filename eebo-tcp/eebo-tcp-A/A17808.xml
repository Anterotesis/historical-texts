         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The entrance or beginning of a raigne is moſt commonly thornie and difficulty, yea dangerous and painefull; not onely full of cares, but alſo tedious and troubleſome: ſo that it had beene better for ſome kings to haue neuer raigned, or elſe to haue ended their dayes at their beginning. This moued the Philoſopher <hi>Solon</hi> to ſing theſe verſes to <hi>Mydas</hi> king of Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, at the entrance of his Cities:</p>
                  <q>

                  </q>
                  <p>But your Maieſtie (great King) who by the ſpeciall grace of God, and the prudence wherewith he hath endued you, farre aboue all other Princes, haue found the entrance of your raign ſpacious, delightfull and ſecure: and being grounded vpon the protection, enuironed with the bleſsings, &amp; conducted by the prouidence of that Soueraigne diſpenſer of Scepters and Crownes; you haue hitherto raigned, to the admiration of all the world, PVISSANT AND MAGNIFICENT, RICH AND CONTENT, HAPPY AND GLORIOVS; and in all, perfect and accompliſht.</p>
                  <p>PVISSANT AND MAGNIFICENT indeede, ſith that (with full power and authoritie you raigne ouer ſo many pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant
<pb facs="tcp:7782:6"/>
Nations, which God hath ſubiected to your Maieſtie, vnder the homage and duety which you daily pay vnto him, as to the onely ſoueraigne King of kings.</p>
                  <p>RICH AND CONTENT, in poſſeſsing them peaceably, without oppoſition; extracting pleaſure of all that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed for the glory of God, which you ſeeke for your owne contentment.</p>
                  <p>HAPPY AND GLORIOVS alſo, ſith that (by thoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of loue which God giues you, and the thankeſgiuing which your Maieſty yeeldeth him) you haue vpon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons free acceſſe to his incomprehenſible Maieſty, a familiar entertainment with his infinite goodneſſe; Heauen being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes open to your contemplations, and whatſoeuer your Maieſty can thinke moſt exquiſite, rare on earth, fauourable to your wiſhes, is all bent for your felicitie. Oh how happy is your ſacred Maieſtie! what mortall can apprehend it? how glorious! and who is he that can expreſſe it?</p>
                  <p>But behold, this is the chief point, ouer which my conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations cannot paſs without ſtaying; &amp; yet reſt they neuer ſo little, they enter as it were into a labyrinth for a while. Gods graces and bleſsings fall moſt commonly into vngratefull hands, who diſpence thereof the more niggardly, by how much they receiue them aboundantly: and the moſt part of men erre ſo farre, that in ſtead of worſhipping in them the ſoueraigne power and prouidence of God, they ſtriue to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell him; nay, it lies meerly in their owne vnpowerfulneſſe, that they doe not ouerthrow his incomprehenſible Empire and Throne of glory. By meanes whereof, it falls out that it ofttimes chances to them, as to thoſe ſubalternal Deities, who for putting themſelues in <hi>Iupiters</hi> bedde, were by a boyſterous
<pb facs="tcp:7782:7"/>
winde, ſuddenly metamorphoſed into ſtrange ſhapes.</p>
                  <p>But your Highneſſe (mighty king) makes vſe of it, as fire of the perfume; you returne thoſe bleſsings to heauen againe through your praiſes and thankſgiuing: you diſperſe them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you by your royall liberality; for whoſoeuer hath the honour to approach neere your Diuinity, is enlightned with the beames of your diuine vertues. And as <hi>Salomon</hi> did build and (with the ſtones of mountaines, and Cedars of Libanus) erect Altars to God: ſo you make therof inſtruments, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terialls to prop the houſe of God.</p>
                  <p>Soueraigne authority vpon the people, meetes often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with violent hearts, which makes him not vnlike the daily motion of the Sunne; ſo ſwift, that it is terrible; and ſo terrible, that it would conſume away if it ſhould laſt long: but your Maieſty knowes well how to temper your Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie by your Iuſtice, &amp; likewiſe your will by your prudence; inſomuch that this firſt courſe is moderated by the ſecond, which is yearely, and runneth from Weſt to Eaſt by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Zodiaque circle: by this ſweet, temperate and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate courſe you order the ſeaſons in your Monarchy: you cauſe a delightſome Spring, that produceth diuerſity of flowers in aboundance; a rich and pleaſant Summer, which yeelds all kinde of fruites plentifully, by which you reward paines and labours, you reflect the deſires, you content the hopes of euery one, according to your wiſe diſpenſation. And as God is not contented meerely to bring forth his actions in the higheſt heauen; but by his Spirits adminiſtration, deſcends from that palace of glory, to the loweſt deep, runing &amp; flying thorow all quarters of this Hemiſphere, to diſpoſe all things by his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty powerfulneſſe: Your Highneſſe (prudent King) imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
<pb facs="tcp:7782:7"/>
the proceedings of that incomprehenſible Monarch of Heauen and earth, which alone is a patterne to your ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Maieſty, do not anchor your actions in that Imperiall Hauen of your glory, the kingdome of England, which, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by the Soueraign authority of your Highneſſe, as her <hi>primum mobile,</hi> carries thoſe to others which are ioined to him, by the bands of one only power, Scotland and Ireland: but alſo the fame of your rare vertues ſpreads all ouer beyond the ſeas, your admirable prudency; &amp; your immortal pen, the fruit of your deep learning, at which nations being amazed, admire with reuerence, ſo rare and accompliſht a Maieſty.</p>
                  <p>But what Eaſt wind driues my ſails into ſo wide an Ocean, carrying away my endeuours farre beyond the reach of my power? Stay, my thoughts; whither runne yee? Reſt conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. My curioſitie, what ſeekeſt thou? Silence, my tongue; what doſt thou ſay? Oh! would my skill, which is ſo ſmall, dare to aſpire to ſo high a taske, ſo weake and raſhly to think to penetrate thorow ſo bright a ſunne? ſo ſhort, and preſume to ſound his depth? <hi>Good King</hi> pardon theſe hardy glances of my ſpirit, enlightned with a diuine light, and animated by an extraordinary vertue. Thoſe which aſpect the beames of the Sunne, within the Sunne, thinke a long time after they behold ſtill a Sunne before their eyes; not being able, by withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſenſe of the obiect, to draw the Idea of the ſpirit. Thus ſince I haue had the honour to ſee in ſo <hi>happy</hi> and <hi>glorious deeds</hi> your <hi>actions,</hi> in your <hi>actions</hi> your <hi>vertues,</hi> in your <hi>vertues</hi> your <hi>Maieſty,</hi> and your <hi>Maieſty</hi> in it <hi>ſelfe</hi>; theſe rare and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite obiects, as ſo many Sunnes, haue ſo rauiſhed my ſenſes and eyes, that they ſeeme to ſee them alwaies preſent before them. Moreouer, the Idea which is remayning in my intellect, hath

brought them to ſuch extraordinary deſignes, that if my forces were correſpondent to my deſires, and my vnworthineſſe to the dignity of the ſubiect which animates me, I had alreadie proclaim'd your diuine perfections from one end of the earth to the other, yea from the earth to the heauens: and taking for my auditors ſo many bleſſed ſoules, which there gloriouſly inhabite, I ſhould haue recited to them, with the admirable actions of your incomparable vertues, theſe glorious and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed deeds which iſſue thereof, and the moſt excellent glory which your Maieſtie thereby inherites; at leaſt, how in theſe laſt fearefull troubles of my ſad, afflicted, and ſorely deſolate countrey, which ſo farre oppreſt her, that loſing the ſight of her owne reaſon, ſhe had almoſt loſt her ſelfe in it ſelfe; or, as I may well ſay, ſpoyled her ſelfe with her owne ſtrength and defence. Your Piety (all-rare Prince) which is all-Iuſtice, caſt her compaſsionate eyes vpon the deplorable and moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable condition of her poore oppreſſed brood: your Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which is all-Charity, lent her eare to their wofull &amp; ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull complaints: your Charity, which is all-Prudence, opened her heart to their needy miſeries and extreme wants, and your Prudence (which hath alwayes the eyes, the eares, and the heart open at all times to ſuch poore afflicted wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, who doe implore of your Maieſtie like pious actions) making at that time a charitable diſtribution, euer bound both publike and particulars to vow their heartie prayers to heauen for your health; &amp; their true ſeruices to the world for the proſperitie, greatneſſe, pleaſure and contentment of your Maieſtie.</p>
                  <p>But the worthineſſe of the ſubiect, and my inſufficiency, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing deterr'd me from ſo high an enterpriſe; I haue modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

my deſignes, which aſpired ſo high, and placing them in a meane region, I rul'd my endeauours by my might, doing my beſt to finde out, as well for my owne ſatisfaction, as for the good of others, to whom I communicate as many conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for miſeries, and inſtructions of this wicked ages expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; in which we ſee regenerated what remained of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, inſtruments, materials and labours, to perfect the worke of this ages iniquity, the lees of ages paſt, which with his muddy wine troubles the braines, corrupts the manners, and debaucheth the nobleſt functions of manie: I haue deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them for to ſeek out the growth, beginning, and progreſſe of this happy and magnificent reeſtabliſhment of Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call truth and puritie, the firſt and ſoueraigne cauſe of your Maieſties glory, the ſecuritie of your eſtate, and proſperitie of your people, which in this flouriſhing Empire hath three crowns, of which your Ma: is the firſt Monarch, who receiue from Gods fauourable grace, by the hands of your religious prudence, ſo great a perfection, that it makes the whole work moſt wonderfull: a prop ſo ſolid, that when the raine is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, the ſtormy ſtreames and impetuous floods come againſt it, and when the windes haue raged ſtrongly, and blowne fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly at it, it could not be ſhaken, but ſtill remained firme, ſtrong, conſtant, and alwayes a flouriſhing pillar of ſecuritie.</p>
                  <p>And my deſignes haue ſo happily, though vnfortunately, ſucceeded, that when I had collected my ſenſes, and prepared my ſelfe for this Work, I found it ready done by one of your Ma: ſubiects, in the Latine Hiſtory, which he hath digeſted into yeares, deſcribing ſuch things as paſſed during the moſt glorious raigne of that heroick &amp; inuincible Princeſſe, aboue her ſexe, full of magnanimitie, rare in Piety, admirable in her

ſowed in the fields of peace, to be reaped by the peace-makers; that piety hath both the promiſe of the preſent and the future life, and that indeed it is the originall ſource from whence ſpring all other vertues.</p>
                  <p>Your ſacred Highneſſe (pious Monarch) hath already ſeene and peruſed the manuſcripts of this worke, which I preſented to your Maieſty ſome moneths agoe, to receiue from you, as from my Oracle, direction, whether I ſhould publiſh it or not.

And if I may be ſo happy, as to ſee this my labour once more approued, &amp; my oblation gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly receiued of your Ma: I hope that my courage, anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſo good fortune, will performe a greater enterpriſe; and ſo great a fauour, rouſing vp and reuiuing my ſpirits, will make my labours ſo fruitfull, that I may be able in time to quit my ſelfe of my vowes and duties, &amp; pay vnto your Ma: (with a better labour) more agreeable ſeruices, &amp; to the world fairer fruits of my ſtudy.</p>

And truly thoſe which it moſt concernes, haue had, of a long time, that power vpon my owne proper benefites, ſith my contentment conſiſts not in the praiſe of Printing, but to pleaſe and profite thereby the vertuous and gracious. The courſes of this worlds affaires, and the diuerſe inclinations of men, inſtruct me that it will be beneficiall to diuers, yea to the enemies hereof, who for not vnderſtanding truely the Latine hitherto, could not haue a true knowledge of its particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>ILLIAM CECIL,</hi> Baron of <hi>Burghley,</hi> Lord High Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> (about <hi>16.</hi> yeers past) opened vnto me (farre from my thought) firſt, ſome memorials of State of his own: afterwards, thoſe of the Kingdome; and from them, willed me to compile a <hi>Hiſtorie</hi> of Q. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> Raigne from the beginning. I know not to what intent, vnleſſe whileſt he prouiding for the propagation of the Queenes honour, meant to take a taſte of my abilitie in this kind. I obeyed, and indeed not vnwillingly, leſt I ſhould be thought to haue been wanting to the memory of the beſt Princeſſe, his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, and truth it ſelfe; which to me equals them both. For ſhee being eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and hauing hidden herſelfe, my hope is to finde her there, or no where.</p>
                  <p>But in the firſt entrie, a moſt intricate difficultie deterred me: I fell vpon whole maſſes of writings, &amp; inſtruments of all kinds, well enough digeſted for the computation of the times, but very confuſed for varietie of argument; in examining whereof, I was couered with duſt and ſweat. I diligently collected together fit matter, harder to find out than I expected: but he dying, mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie ſlackt. And after that, that incomparable Princeſſe had rendred her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſoule to heauen, I waited a while with a greedy expectation, not only who, but if ſome one, of ſo great a number of learned men, who by her bounty abound in riches &amp; leaſure, would repay this due and deſerued thanks. But when I had certainly obſerued, that weightier affaires hindred ſome that were beſt able to performe it; others, (I know not for what cauſes) with ſpecious excuſes refuſed it: Afterwards, I eftſoones betook myſelf to my interrupted ſtudy, &amp; embraced it more vehemently than before. I ſought all manner of helps on euery ſide, I ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulouſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> volued &amp; reuolued Characters of Kings &amp; Peers, Letters, Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons held at the Councell-Table; I ran through the inſtructions &amp; letters of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, &amp; likewiſe the Records &amp; Iournals of Parliaments, Acts &amp; Statuts, &amp; read ouer al Proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For moſt of which (as I ought) I hold my ſelf chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound to ſir <hi>R: Cotton,</hi> kt. Baronet, who with great expence, &amp; happy labor, hath gatherd together moſt choice variety of Hiſtories &amp; Antiquity: for at his torch, he willingly ſufferd me to light my taper. So as <hi>(Reader)</hi> if in this I haue don any thing pleaſing vnto thee or profitable, thou oweſt him the merited thanks.</p>
                  <p>I haue alſo made ſearch throughout mine own Cabinets; &amp; although I am an admirer of venerable antiquitie, I am not iniurious to later things: I haue ſeen &amp; obſerued much, &amp; haue from elder men than my ſelfe, worthy of beliefe (who were preſent when theſe were acted, &amp; ſtudious on both ſides, in this diuiſion of
<pb facs="tcp:7782:16"/>
Religion) receiued them, &amp; haue weighed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ballance of my Iudgment, ſuch as it is leſt by a deceiueable credulity I ſhould incline towards thoſe which are falſe. For the ſtudy of <hi>TRVTH,</hi> as it hath been the only ſpur to prick me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to this Worke; ſo hath it beene mine only Scope. To detract from Hiſtorie, is nothing elſe than to pluck out the eies of a beautifull creature, and for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinable potion, to offer poiſon to the Readers vnderſtanding.</p>
                  <p>All thoſe things which are wont to hinder the light of Truth, I purpoſely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided, and as much as in me lay, haue vncaſed <hi>IGNORANCE</hi> &amp; <hi>FALSHOOD,</hi> by the light of a Witneſſe pure &amp; neat, drawn from theſe <hi>VNSKILFVLNESSE</hi> &amp; her deriuatiues, <hi>DOVBT</hi> &amp; <hi>FALSITY</hi> haue I diſpelled, as well as I could, by the ſplendor of an incorrupt faith, out of thoſe monuments aboue al exception; &amp; it may be, from them haue gotten no leſſe knowledge of thoſe things, than they which haue had long &amp; great imployment in the Common-wealth. I haue auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>PREIVDICE,</hi> as an abuſer of the Iudgement, which ſo infects the mind in affairs of Religion and the Reipublique; that like them that haue ſore eyes, they ſee nothing cleerly. I haue not feared <hi>DANGER,</hi> no not from them, who by their preſent power thinke the memorie of the ſucceeding Age may be extinguiſhed. And let them remember, that as many as haue beene iniurious to Writers, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of the Truth, haue procured to themſelues diſhonour; to them glorie.</p>
                  <p>The hope of a <hi>LITTLE GAINE</hi> miſſe-led me not; To make the dignitie of Hiſtorie mercenarie, I (who haue alwaies contented my ſelfe with a meane for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune) haue held ſordid and ſeruile. I haue left no place to the <hi>SVSPICION OF FAVOVR OR PRIVATE GRVDGES;</hi> for of theſe I am to write of Scarce two were known to me by any benefit: by iniury, not one; that I ſhould be reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>PARTIAL</hi> or the <hi>OFFENDED.</hi> Thoſe which are aliue, I haue ſcarſe touched at. Inueighing againſt the enemies of my Countrie, I haue held it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, to hunt after the name of a good Patriot, with the aſperſion of an ill Hiſtorian. Theſe things haue I been carefull of, that (as <hi>POLYBIVS</hi> commands) I might <hi>SACRIFICE ONLY TO TRVTH.</hi> Neither ſhall any man, I hope, finde wanting in me, that ingenious liberty (ioyned with modeſtie) of ſpeech, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of an Historian: That, which vnder a falſe diſguiſe ioyned with the poiſon of obtrectation perſonates libertie, and is ſo pleaſing to euery eare, I deteſt from my heart. Things <hi>MANIFEST,</hi> I haue not concealed, things <hi>DOVBTFVL</hi> I haue tenderly interpreted: the more <hi>ABSTRVSE,</hi> I haue not been too inquiſitiue of; The vnſearchable intents of Princes (ſaith that Prince of Hiſtorie) and what they out of reaſons of State pretend, is not fit to inquire; &amp; being doubtfull, not to be explored. And with <hi>HALYCARNASS AEVS,</hi> I am iuſtly angry which the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant critiques, who go about to know or find out more than is iuſtly permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. As to the reſt, although I know, that matters militarie and politique are
<pb facs="tcp:7782:16"/>
the proper ſubiects of an Hiſtorian, yet I neither could nor ought to omit Eccleſiaſticall affaires (for betwixt Religion and policy there can be no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce. But ſeeing the Writer of the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtorie, may lawfully chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge theſe things, as proper to himſelf, I haue not touched at them otherwiſe than as it were with a light and curſory hand; whereas it is the Law and dignitie of an Hiſtorian, to run through the moſt eminent actions, and not to dwell vpon ſmall ones: I haue not therefore laboured in them, yet there are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of leſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence, which may concern another profeſſor, though not him. I haue not omitted any circumſtances, by which, not only the euents of things, but their reaſons alſo and cauſes may be known; That of <hi>POLYBIVS</hi> pleaſeth me exceedingly, If you take out of Hiſtory, <hi>WHY, HOVV, TO WHAT END,</hi> and <hi>WHAT IS DONE<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and whether the Actions anſwer the intents, that that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, is rather a mocking than an inſtruction; And for the preſent may pleaſe, but will neuer profit Poſteritie; I haue not betrayed my <hi>IVDGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT</hi> to affection for writing with an impartiall minde, I haue rather deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to finde out the affections of other men. I haue inſerted little of mine own, treating of matters in another kind, it being a controuerted point, whether or no it be lawfull for an Hiſtorian to doe it. Let euery one abound in his owne ſenſe: I haue thruſt in no occaſions, but ſuch as were truly ſpoken; or thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to fewer words: much leſſe haue I fained any. I haue ſeldome vſed Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, nor beautified my diſcourſes with thoſe obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which the Greeks aptly call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, my intent being as it were inſenſibly to inſtruct the minde. I haue ſhunned digreſsions; I haue vſed formall words; I haue not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected diſcriptions of places, pedigrees, nor Chronologies, following, as neere as is poſsible, the order of the Times; beginning the yeare (as our Chronologers were wont) from the firſt of <hi>IANVARY.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I haue inſcribed my diſcourſes with the name of <hi>ANNALS,</hi> becauſe I place e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery paſſage in his owne yeare; and becauſe <hi>TACITVS</hi> directs vs, that great &amp; illuſtrious Actions ſhould be committed to Annals; whoſe principall office it is to take care, that Vertue be not obſcured, and by the relation of euill words or deeds, to propoſe the feare of infamie, with poſteritie. And that ſterile and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted kind of writing (ſuch as mine is) is for Annals, of all other, moſt fit.</p>
                  <p>With theſe beginnings I applyed my mind to write, with this reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, &amp; intended to beſtow the reſt of my time and induſtrie, in the beautify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poliſhing, and exornation of theſe Annals: and then by my laſt Will, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath them to my honorable friend <hi>IAMES AVGVSTVS THVANVS,</hi> who hath begun a Hiſtorie of his owne Times, with great truth and modeſtie; leſt that, as ſtrangers are wont, he, a man moſt deare vnto me, ſhould like a traueller in a forraine Countrie, be ignorant of our affaires. But this reſolution I was forced
<pb facs="tcp:7782:17"/>
(I know not by what fate) to alter; for a great part being ſent vnto him, ſome few years paſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were like rough-drawn pictures ſcarcely begun, defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with blots &amp; imperfect places, ſwarming with errors &amp; patches thrust in, as they fell from a haſty pen, &amp; ill vſed by Tranſcribers: Out of theſe he took &amp; as it were inter-weaued ſome things into the eleuenth and twelfth Tomes of his Hiſtorie, hauing firſt poliſhed them by adding, altering, ſubſtracting, but all with good iudgement (according to that order of the worke which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to himſelfe) (for he intended a vniuerſall Hiſtorie of his owne Time) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting ſome few things concerning <hi>ENGLAND</hi> and <hi>IRELAND,</hi> ommitting many things not only fit, but peraduenture neceſſary for vs to know, and I had heard that beyond the Seas, the Hiſtorie of Engliſh affaires was much (and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reproach) deſired; I therefore betook me to my intermitted ſtudy, read all ouer againe, corrected, added diuers things, refined the eloquution, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affectation; for it ſufficeth me, if I may place this Booke like a picture in water colours, vnskilfully done, in a commodious light.</p>
                  <p>But when all was done, I was much perplext &amp; irreſolute, whether I ſhould publiſh it or not. But <hi>CENSVRES, PREIVDICE, HATRED, OBTRECTATION,</hi> which I foreſaw to diſplay their colors, and bid battell againſt me, haue not ſo much deterred me, as the deſire of <hi>TRVTH,</hi> the loue of <hi>MY COVNTRY,</hi> and the memory of that <hi>PRINCESSE,</hi> (which deſerues to be deare and ſacred amongſt Engliſh men) did excite me against thoſe, who ſhaking off their allegeance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Prince and Country, did not ceaſe beyond the Seas, to wound aſwel the Honor of the one, as the glory of the other, by ſcandalous libels, conceiued by the malice of their own hearts; &amp; now, (which they ſticke not to confeſſe) are about to publiſh a Book to remain to poſteritie, as a monument of their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. As for me, I deſire nothing more, than to be like my ſelf, &amp; they like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Succeeding ages will giue to euery one their deſerued Honor. I confeſſe with ſorrow, that I haue not done ſo wel, as the height of the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t requires; but what I could, I haue done willingly. To my ſelfe, as in other writings, ſo neither in theſe, haue I giuen ſatisfaction. But I ſhall hold it more than ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, if out of an earneſt deſire to conſerue the memorie of things, of truth in relating them, &amp; inſtructing mens minds with that which is wiſe and honeſt, I ſhall be ranked only amongst the lowest writers of great things:</p>

But he, notwithſtanding all this, ſurceaſed not his ſuite, but perſiſted therein, vrging her with feruent and frequent Letters: By which ſhee obſerued the manners and behauiours of ſo great a King, compounded with grace and graue modeſty, and truely worthy his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, the ſaid Letters being much by her admired, in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten publiſhing of them; yea, her Maieſtie taking pleaſure to imitate them, vntill ſome Nobles of her Court began to

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7782:59"/>
This raiſed the heart of the Cardinall of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> who aſſured the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that the Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> his Niece was truely and vndoubtedly Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> ought to imploy all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if he made any account of iuſtice, to cauſe <hi>Calais</hi> to be deliuered into the hands of his Niece, the direct Queene of <hi>England.</hi> But the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which ſuſpected the power of <hi>France,</hi> not hearing that willingly, tryed ſecretly to draw out of <hi>England</hi> the Lady <hi>Katherine Gray,</hi> the yonger Niece of King HENRY the Eighth, for his Siſters ſake, to oppoſe her to the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> if Queene ELIZABETH ſhould happen to deceaſe, and to hinder thereby that <hi>France</hi> might not be augmented by the ſurcreaſe of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; And ſtrongly inſiſted, that there ſhould be a Truce betwixt <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> vntill ſuch time they ſhould agree together, and that in the meane time <hi>Calais</hi> ſhould be ſequeſtred in the hands of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as an Arbitrator of honour. But that was refuſed as much by the <hi>French</hi> as the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Queene ELIZABETH had well preſaged that: for ſhee could not hope for any good from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſide, ſeeing that ſhe had contemned and deſpiſed to marry with their King, and changed Religion.

your iuſt and vigilant gouernement hath hitherto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured vnto the Engliſh Nation. But wee cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue how this ſhould alwayes continue, vnleſse that (which wee cannot hope for) you ſhould continually reigne, or by diſpoſing your ſelfe to marriage, might leaue Children, which might inherite both your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Kingdome together; the Almightie and good God ſo grant. This <hi>(MADAME)</hi> is the ſimple and vnanime deſire of all the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which is the conceit of all others: Euery one ought to haue a care of that place and eſtate hee hath, and Princes eſpecially, that ſithence they are but mortall, the Common-wealth might bee perpetuis'd in immortalitie.

For queſtionleſſe, the onely aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of an Husband, is more auayleable in the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of affaires, than the helpe of a great many ioyned together, and nothing can be more repugnant to the common good, than to ſee a Princeſſe, who by marriage may preſerue the Common-wealth in peace, to leade a ſingle life, like a Veſtal Nunne.

Which is freſh in memory, when <hi>HENRY</hi> the Seuenth, your Grand-father, prouided marriage for <hi>ARTHVR,</hi> and <hi>HENRY</hi> his Children, being yet of tender yeeres; and how your Father procured in marriage for <hi>EDWARD</hi> his ſonne, hauing ſcarce attayned to eight yeeres of age, <hi>Mary</hi> the Queene of <hi>Scots;</hi> and ſithence, how <hi>MARY</hi> your Siſter, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

And therefore it is, that I haue made choyce of this kinde of life, which is moſt free, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for ſuch humane affaires as may tend to his ſeruice onely; from which, if eyther the marriages which haue beene offered mee by diuers puiſſant Princes, or the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of attempts made againſt my life, could no whit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert mee, it is long ſince I had any ioy in the honour
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7782:63"/>
of a Husband; and this is that I thought, then that I was a priuate perſon. But when the publique charge of gouerning the Kingdome came vpon mee, it ſeemed vnto mee an inconſiderate folly, to draw vpon my ſelfe the cares which might proceede of marriage. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, I am already bound vnto an Husband, which is the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and that may ſuffice you: and this <hi>(quoth ſhee)</hi> makes mee wonder, that you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get your ſelues, the pledge of this alliance which I haue made with my Kingdome. <hi>(And therwithall, ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out her hand, ſhee ſhewed them the Ring with which ſhee was giuen in marriage, and inaugurated to her Kingdome, in expreſſe and ſolemne termes.)</hi> And reproch mee ſo no more, (<hi>quoth ſhee</hi>) that I haue no children: for euery one of you, and as many as are <hi>Engliſh,</hi> are my Children, and Kinsfolkes, of whom, ſo long as I am not depriued, (and God ſhall preſerue mee) you cannot charge mee, without offence, to be deſtitute. But in this I muſt commend you, that you haue not appoynted mee an Husband: for that were vnworthy the Maieſtie of an abſolute Princeſse, and the diſcretion of you that are borne my Subiects. Neuertheleſse, if GOD haue ordayned mee to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe of life, I will promiſe you to doe nothing to the preiudice of the Common-wealth, but, as farre as poſsible I may, will marry ſuch an Husband as ſhall bee no leſſe carefull for the common good, than my ſelfe. And if I perſiſt in this which I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vnto my ſelfe, I aſſure my ſelfe, that GOD will ſo direct my counſels and yours, that you ſhall haue no cauſe to doubt of a Succeſſour: which may be more profitable for the Common-wealth, than him which may proceede from mee, ſithence the poſterity of good Princes doth oftentimes degenerate.

And I want not friends, nor friends that are willing and powerfull to bring mee backe thither, as they were to bring mee hither. But I choſe rather to try her friendſhip than any others. I haue often heard you ſay, that it was chiefly neceſsary to our two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes to intertaine amity, the one with the other: and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7782:84"/>
neuertheleſſe it ſeemes that ſhee hath another meaning, otherwiſe ſhee would not haue refuſed mee ſo ſmall a courteſie.

Doe you thinke, that with ſo great a faith and loue which is betweene her and me, ſhe ſhould keepe correſpondency with the <hi>Scots</hi> which rebell againſt me? Does ſhee thinke that I ſhall be forſaken of my friends? Truely, ſhee hath brought mee to that paſse, that I haue reclaymed the ayde of thoſe which otherwiſe I would not haue imployed, and I cannot maruell enough by what counſell ſhe hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore aſsiſted my Subiects againſt mee, and now that I am a Widdow, am hindered from returning into my Countrey.

But I leaue compariſons, which cannot be, but with debate and hatred. As for the Treaty of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borrough,</hi> it was made in the life-time of the <hi>King</hi> my Husband, to whom I was bound by duety to obey in all things; and ſince hee deferred the confirmation of it, the fault ought to be his, and not mine.

by mine owne friends, and my Vnkles would not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the affaires of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for offending in any thing either Queene <hi>ELIZABETH,</hi> or the <hi>Scots.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> that I haue neere about me, are priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and are not ſuch as I would aske their counſell in things of ſo great importance. As ſoone as I haue conſulted with the States of my Kingdome, I will giue you a reaſonable anſwer, and to giue it ſo much the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I goe forward to returne to my Houſe. But ſhee makes account to ſtop my paſsage, inſomuch that ſhee her ſelfe is the cauſe that I cannot ſatisfie her; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture ſhe does it to the end, that there may not be any end of our diſcords. Shee often obiects vnto me, as to my ſhame, that I am young: and truely ſhee might rightly ſay it, both very young, and very ill-aduiſed, if I would treate of a buſineſſe of that importance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of my States. A woman, as I haue learned, is not bound either by honour or conſcience to her Husbands fact. But I will haue no diſpute vpon that, and neuertheleſſe I will truely ſay, that I haue done nothing to my moſt deare Siſter, that I would ſhould not haue beene done vnto my ſelfe. I haue ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred her all duties of friendſhip, but ſhee either beleeues them not, or deſpiſeth them. I would to God that I were as deare to her, as I am neere to her, for that would be a precious kinde of proximitie. God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thoſe which ſow diſcords betweene vs, if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.

As to the laſt, I hope that my ſeditious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects will not complaine of my inclemencie.

For I haue diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that diſsimulation thruſts her ſelfe into theſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, vnder the maske of libertie, and of ſucceſsion. There are ſome of them among you, who are of opinion, that I ought preſently to grant, or vtterly to refuſe libertie to diſpute of the Succeſsion, and to eſtabliſh it.

Thinke you that I contemne your good and ſafetie, that you ground vpon a Succeſſor? or that I will infringe your libertie? So farre am I from that, that I haue not ſo much as thought of it. For I haue conſidered, that it behooued you to retyre from the pit into which you runne head-long. Euery thing hath his ſeaſon. Peraduenture you ſhall haue after me a wiſer Prince, but not that loues you more than I doe. I know not if I ſhall liue to ſee ſuch Aſſemblies once more: but take heede of offending the patience of your Prince: and notwithſtanding, take it for a certaine truth, that I haue a good opinion of the moſt part of you, and that I loue you all with all my heart, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.</q>

                     <p>After this, by a Writing vnſeal'd, filled with variety of diſcourſe, which they committed to <hi>Throgmortons</hi> hands, they vowed and proteſted, that the Queene was remoued, and reſtrained to a cloſe place, for no other end, but to diſioyne her from Earle <hi>Bothwell,</hi> whom ſhee moſt entyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loued, till this heat of affection, and her wrath concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued againſt them, might ſomewhat ſlacken: and therefore they requeſted him to be ſatisfied in this Anſwer, while
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7782:124"/>
ſome other Nobles of the Kingdome were aſſembled: and yet neuertheleſſe they reſtrayned the Queenes liberty, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day more and more, though with teares ſhee intreated them to vſe her more fauourably, if not as Queene, yet as ſhee was a Kings Daughter, and Mother to their Prince: and ſo hee many times requeſted, that hee might goe and viſit her, but all in vaine. Briefly, not to rip vp in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular all the iniuries and diſgraces offered her, at laſt they made triall, whether by milde and faire meanes, they could induce her, freely to giue ouer the gouernement, either by reaſon of her weakeneſſe and indiſpoſition, or in reſpect of the trouble and annoyance it brought her to, to reigne and gouerne: which indeed they deuiſed for an excuſe, or elſe as others counſelled her, with more drift and ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to the end that being more weakly and graceleſſely gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſhee might the more ſafely and eaſily make her eſcape. But when all this tooke no place, they threatned to bring her to a publique triall, to accuſe her that ſhee had led an incontinent life, murdered the King her former Husband, and practiſed tyranny in violating the Lawes, and ancient priuiledges of their Country, eſpecially thoſe which <hi>De R.</hi> and <hi>De Oiſel</hi> had enacted in the King of <hi>France</hi> his name, and her owne.

And though the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> poſſeſſed it for the ſpace of three and twenty yeeres more or leſſe, yet the originall title euer remained to the King of <hi>France,</hi> as well as that of the Duchies of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe detayned for a long time, by the force of their Armes. That the <hi>French</hi> did not conquer, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther recouered <hi>Calais,</hi> with their Armes, euen as they did their former Dukedomes.

Children begotten in ſuch marriages, tooke from their birth, I know not what kind of extraordinarie propertie and diſpoſition. That frequent commerce with ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, brought into the Common-wealth ſtrange maners and faſhions of life; and that Ladies Princeſſes, by theſe Marriages, in ſtead of augmenting their owne Kingdomes, added to thoſe of their Husbands, ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelues and their Subiects to their commands, and laid open to ſtrangers the ſecrets of their Kingdoms.

That ſome alleadged in ſcorne of the Nobility, That the Queene marrying within the Kingdome, ſhould ſomewhat impaire her Royall dignity; whereas her Maieſtie, who by her vertue opened a way to riſe vnto this Soueraigntie, was extracted from Nobility, and that yet there are ſome Nobles of the Royall Blood, who are like Sprigs of the ſame Royall Branch or Arme, and hereupon, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> haue euer in their Letters, honoured Dukes, Marquiſſes, Earles, and Vicounts, with this Title of Couſins.</q>

                        </note> to bee preſent at the celebration of Maſſe. In this affaire, many difficulties preſented themſelues about Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the Arch-duke's mayntenance, the ſtile of King, and the ſucceſſion to the Kingdome; and many points were argued both of the one ſide and the other: For the Title and Stile of King, it was accorded he ſhould haue it. For the Succeſſion, in that hee could not enioy it by the Lawes of the Kingdome, in that it was preiudiciall to the Children, hee ſhould haue the tutelage and gardianſhip of them. And that nothing more was granted to <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> when he married Queene MARY. As for his maintenance, if hee would furniſh them at his charge, whom he ſhould bring with him and retaine in the Court, the Queene, out of her Royall Dignitie, would abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcharge the reſt, yea, and that too, if he required it. But one ſcruple ſtill remained touching Religion: For the Emperour demanded, as alſo <hi>Charles</hi> himſelfe, that he might haue a publike Church granted him, whither hee might repaire with his Court, to the celebration of diuine Seruice according to the <hi>Romane</hi> forme. But this beeing refuſed, the Emperour was ſatisfied with an indifferent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was, That hee might haue a peculiar place or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained within the Court for this purpoſe, where he might quietly performe his Deuotions, as euer it is permitted the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Romane</hi> Princes, with a prouiſo that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould not bee thereto admitted, and that neither hee nor his Followers did oppugne the Religion receiued in <hi>England,</hi> neither fauour any oppoſites. If any diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment grew about Diuine Seruice, hee ſhould for a time forbeare his ordinary exerciſe, and with the Queene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to that celebration performed according to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> When this Treatie had beene ſagely
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7782:130"/>
diſcuſſed of in <hi>England,</hi> (that I may not relate any further of the negotiation) the Queene made anſwere, That if ſhee yeelded to this, ſhe ſhould offend her owne Conſcience, and openly violate the publike Lawes of the Kingdome, to the extreme perill both of her dignitie and ſafety: But if <hi>Charles</hi> were pleaſed to come into <hi>England,</hi> to ſee her, he ſhould reape fruites worthy his trauell and paines. And thus the Emperour diſmiſſed the Earle of <hi>Suſsex</hi> with great honour: and the Earle of <hi>Suſsex</hi> turning a little out of his way to ſee <hi>Charles,</hi> tooke his leaue of him at <hi>Gratz</hi>; and the Arch-duke <hi>Charles,</hi> expecting to receiue a more fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Anſwere, found himſelfe fruſtrated of his intention. For this proſecution was giuen ouer by little and little, which made a progreſſion of ſeuen whole yeeres, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers intercourſes of honourable Embaſſies: it leauing not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding a mutuall loue and amity betweene the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo cordiall and inherent, that the Emperour alwaies croſt the Popes deſignes againſt Queene ELIZABETH.

That the Nobles of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, being moued herewith, they thought they could not diſcharge a better office, than to puniſh <hi>Bothwell,</hi> the author of this aſſaſsinate: for, all ouer the Country, it was imputed to a generall conſpiracy among the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall of the Nobilitie, to reſtore the Queene to her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer libertie, to diſſolue this vniuſt marriage, and to prouide for the young Kings ſafetie, and the quiet and tranquillitie of the Kingdome.

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7782:142"/>
the Captaine or Gouernour of the Caſtle, and the Maior of <hi>Edenborrough.</hi> For, then in the night, which was a very vnfit ſeaſon, in hoſtile manner they aſſayled the Caſtle of <hi>Bothwick,</hi> where the Queene was, and ſhee, retyring her ſelfe, by the fauour of the night, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently rayſing an Armie, vnder pretext of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, went themſelues into the field, way-layde her, as ſhee went to <hi>Edenborrough,</hi> and aduertized her, by <hi>Grange,</hi> whom they ſent to her, that ſhee ſhould ſhake off <hi>Bothwell,</hi> while hee had appeared in iudgement, and cleared himſelfe: all which ſhee willingly did, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid effuſion of bloud. But <hi>Grange,</hi> vnder-hand, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed <hi>Bothwell</hi> to with-draw himſelfe, promiſing him with oath, that no bodie ſhould purſue him; ſo as hee made away with their owne conſent, and (beeing minded) they might eaſily haue taken him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. But, when they had once gotten the Queene into their hands, for the mannaging of their ambitious deſignes, they made no great reckoning of him: and it is no great wonder, when they beeing the Queenes Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and hauing vowed fidelity to her, ſhee bitterly rebuked them, hauing ſo baſely and vnworthily entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her Royall Maieſty.

That when <hi>Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay</hi> preſented to her the Patents, for her to ſubſcribe vnto, hee terrified her with feare and horrour of death, and ſo by this meanes, enforced her to ſeale with wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping eyes, not hauing ſo much as read the Contents. That the Lord of the Caſtle of <hi>Lake-Leuin,</hi> vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and ſeeing apparantly, that ſhee had ſubſcribed and ſealed againſt her will, hee would not ſet to his hand, as alſo this Reſignation was moſt vniuſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhee had nothing hereby aſsigned her for her owne behoofe and entertainement, neither grant of libertie, nor aſſurance of life. That whoſoeuer will but equally ballance things, hee cannot but iudge this, to be a weake infringement of Royall Authoritie; becauſe, when the Queene was at libertie, in the preſence of many No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Kingdome, ſhee declared how ſhee had done it out of meere conſtraint. And what they boaſt to haue effected by Act of Parliament, can no wayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice her Royall prerogatiue, becauſe in this tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie Parliament, there were preſent but foure Earles, one Biſhop, two Abbots, and ſixe Barons, though aboue an hundred, betweene Earles, Biſhops, and Barons, haue a voyce in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland:</hi> and yet of ſo ſmall a number, ſome proteſted, that what was done, ſhould not redound to the preiudice of the Queene
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7782:143"/>
or her Succeſſours, becauſe ſhee was a priſoner. That the Ambaſſadours of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be certified from her, though they had many times inſtantly vrged it, whether ſhe voluntarily reſigned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Kingdome or no.

And therefore, they humbly entreated the Queens Maieſtie of <hi>England,</hi> to be aſsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her beſt fauour, counſell, and ayde, to the Queene her neere Kinſewoman, ſo lamentably oppreſt. <hi>Thus farre I copied out of the proper Writings of the Commiſſioners.</hi>

At the firſt they drew backe, but preſently after, expreſly refuſed to repaire thither. This miniſtred occaſion to the Queenes Maieſtie, to command them by peremptory Letters which ſhee writ, and cauſed to be conueyed with all expedition, that laying apart all delayes and excuſes, they ſhould incontinently appeare in her Royall preſence; and this onely to terrifie and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely diuert them from entring into this Rebellion, or at leaſt, that they might precipitantly vndertake the ſame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they rallied their forces, or that the matter grew to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny maturitie. For they relyed vpon ſome ſecret ſuccours, which the <hi>Scots</hi> Leaguers, and the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> were to land at the Port of <hi>Herripoole,</hi> within the Biſhopricke of <hi>Dunelme,</hi> as afterwards it was manifeſted.</p>
                     <p>So ſoone as the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> had read theſe Letters, being of a tractable nature, guiltie in his owne conſcience, deepely affected to the Romane Religion, and excited to choller, by reaſon that out of the prerogatiue Royall in Mynes, a rich Copper Myne found in his owne grounds was taken from him, wherein hee thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be wronged: but neuertheleſſe, fed with notable hopes of the Queenes clemency, hee was in a wonderfull perplexitie, whether he ſhould flye, or openly rebell.

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:7782:186"/>
bottome of his heart, condemned the deſigne of ſeizing vpon the Queenes perſon, or the Towre of <hi>London,</hi> and the ſetting at liberty of the Queene of <hi>Scotland:</hi> and that hee neuer harboured a thought ſo much of bringing forraigne Troupes into <hi>Great Brittaine,</hi> but only to ſuppreſſe certaine of the <hi>Scots,</hi> rebelling againſt the Queen.

In the firſt place,
<q>WHether an Ambaſsadour mouing ſedition againſt the Prince vnto whom he is ſent, may enioy the priuiledge of an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, or not? and whether he be not ſubiect to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as an Enemy?</q>

                        <q>WHether a Miniſter or Agent of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Prince, another being crowned in his place, ought to haue the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of an Ambaſsadour?</q>
                        <p>They anſwered, that if ſuch a Prince be lawfully depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, his Miniſter cannot challenge the priuiledge of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, foraſmuch as none but abſolute Princes, which haue ſoueraigne power, can conſtitute Ambaſſadours. In the third place,
<q>WHether a Prince being come into another Kingdome, and kept in hold, may haue his Agent? and if this Agent ought to be accounted an Ambaſſadour, or not?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>They anſwere, That a Prince may prohibit an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour to enter into his Kingdome, and command him out of his Kingdome, if he doth not containe himſelfe within the limits preſcribed to Ambaſſadours, but in the meane time he ought to enioy the priuiledge of an Ambaſſadour, for the authority of his Ambaſſie.</p>
                        <p>Vpon the anſwers of theſe Ciuill-Lawiers, the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe</hi> being called backe from the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprooued, the Councell denounced him not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged an Ambaſſadour, but to be puniſhed as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Malefactor. To which he anſwered;
<q>THat he beeing Ambaſſadour to an abſolute Queene, vniuſtly depoſed, had, according to his duty, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:7782:187"/>
for the libertie of his Princeſſe, and for the good of both the Kingdomes: that hee was come into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land with ample authoritie, vnder publique teſtimony, which hee exhibited, and that the ſacred Rites of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours ought not by any meanes to be violated.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>Whereupon, <hi>Burghley</hi> grauely ſhewes him, that neither the Rites of the Ambaſſies, nor publique Letters of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, are of validitie for Ambaſſadours which offend againſt the publique faith, but are ſubiect to penall actions, and that otherwiſe it ſhould be permitted to wicked Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to attempt againſt the life of Princes, vnpuniſhed. He on the contrary, opinatiuely maintained, that the authority of Ambaſſadours had neuer beene violated by way of Rite, but onely by way of fact (to vſe his owne words) and boldly admoniſheth them not to deale with him more ſharpely then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſadours had beene dealt with, <hi>Throgmorton</hi> in <hi>France, Randolph</hi> and <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who had apparantly excited and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed rebellions, and were acquitted vpon command to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part within a certaine time.

Then <hi>Carter,</hi> chiefe King of Heralds, deliuered into his hands a white wand, which he preſently after deliuered to the Groome Porter, who ſtanding by, did hold it erected the whole time of the Court. Silence againe commanded, the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the Tower, was bidden to bring forth his charge, and preſent the Duke before the Seat of Iuſtice, who foorth-with appeared, on either ſide were the Lieutenants of the Tower, and <hi>Peter Carew,</hi> next of all, he that carried the Axe, the edge thereof turned from the Duke.</p>
                     <p>Silence the third time proclaimed, the Clerke appointed for the Acts of Iudgement, thus ſpake to the Duke,
<q>Thomas, Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> late of <hi>Kenninghale,</hi> in the County of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> hold vp thy hand.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>When he had holden vp his hand, the ſaid Clerke read aloud the Crimes of which he was accuſed, that is to ſay, That in the eleuenth yeere of Queene ELIZABETH, and afterwards, the Duke hath treacherouſly held counſell to depoſe the Queene from her Kingdome, to take away
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:7782:192"/>
her life, and to inuade the Realme by rayſing of warre, and bringing in troupes of Strangers. That notwithſtanding he had certaine knowledge, that <hi>Mary,</hi> late Queene of <hi>Scots,</hi> had arrogated to herſelfe the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>The chiefe points of his accuſation.</hi>
                        </note> with the Title and Armes thereof, yet hath he treated (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to the Queene) of a marriage betwixt them, and contrary to the promiſe vnder his hand and Seale, hath lent vnto her certaine large ſummes of money. That hee had aſſiſted and ſuccoured the Earles of <hi>Northumberland, Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merland, Marquenfield,</hi> and others, notwithſtanding that hee had good notice, that they had raiſed Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Queene, and were chaſed into <hi>Scotland.</hi> That in the thirteenth yeere of the Queenes Reigne, by Letters, he demanded ſuccours of the Pope, <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> ſworne E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to the Queene, of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and Duke <hi>D' Alua,</hi> to ſet the Queene of <hi>Scots</hi> at liberty, and re-eſtabliſh the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane religion in <hi>England.</hi> Finally, that hee had relieued and aided <hi>Heris</hi> a <hi>Scottiſh-man,</hi> and others, enemies to her Maieſtie in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Theſe Articles being read, the Clerke demanded of the D. if he were guilty of theſe accuſations.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon the Duke deſired (if the Law would permit it) that he might haue an Aduocate to defend his cauſe: to which <hi>Catelin</hi> the Chiefe Iuſtice anſwered, that it might not be allowed.</p>
                     <q>THen it is meet, <hi>ſaid he,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Duke demandeth an Aduocate to plead his cauſe.</note> that I ſubmit to the ſentences of the Iudges; but the matter is full of ambiguities; neither did I knowe within theſe foure and twenty houres, that I was to come to Iudgement, and ſo was vnprepared of Bookes.

anſwered, that <hi>Stafford</hi> (indeed) had an Aduocate allowed him, to pleade for him concerning the right of <hi>Azile,</hi> from whence by force he was taken, but for the crime of <hi>Laeſae Maieſtatis,</hi> without any aſſiſtance, hee pleaded his cauſe himſelfe.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>THen, this day <hi>(replyes the Duke)</hi> muſt I my ſelfe plead for my life, goods, my Children, and for what counteruailes all theſe, mine Honour: but let that Honour paſse; if I innocently periſh, GOD will not let it paſſe vnreuenged. Yet this one thing let me be permitted to queſtion; whether that enumeration of crimes will hold true in euery point, and to what point I muſt make anſwere? <hi>Catelin made reply, Since the cauſes are true, this enumeration alſo muſt be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med true.</hi> I deſire to bee inſtructed <hi>(ſaith the Duke)</hi> whether euery of theſe bee crimes of <hi>Laeſae Maieſtatis</hi>? For I haue heard related, that in the cauſe of the Lord <hi>Scroope,</hi> vnder the Reigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4. But as he would haue proceeded, the Clerke interrupted him, ſpeaking with a loud voice,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THomas, Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> art thou guilty of theſe crimes, or no? <hi>The Duke denyed. Then he was further demanded,</hi> How wilt thou be tried? <hi>He anſwered,</hi> I commit my cauſe to God and to theſe Peeres. The odiouſneſſe of theſe crimes amazeth mee, but the Royall clemency of her Maieſtie, from which (beſides what I haue receiued, I can expect no more) much refreſheth me. But of you (my Lord Iudge) let me requeſt thus much, that I may bee iuſtly dealt withall, and that my memory, which is indeede but weake, may not bee too much oppreſſed with a confuſed variety of matters. I confeſſe my ſelfe happy, hauing you my Peeres for Iudges, and with much willingneſſe
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:7782:193"/>
would commit my life to the integrity of the moſt of you. I was aſsured in mine owne innocency, and therefore ſought no way to fly. Yet I cannot but ingenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that I haue beene wanting in my duty towards the Queene, but neuer did I any thing which might touch or offend ſo Royall a Maieſtie. I beſeech you then, that thoſe higher matters may not bee commixt equally with thoſe of <hi>Laeſae Maieſtatis.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Then <hi>Barham,</hi> the Queenes Serieant at Law, began; Thoſe Crimes (ſaith hee) of <hi>Laeſae Maieſtatis,</hi> of which you thus expoſtulate, are theſe. You haue complotted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue the Queene both of Kingdome and life, you haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted of a marriage with the late Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> you haue inuited forraigne powers to inuade the Realme, you haue ſuccoured Rebels, and haue ſent ayde to thoſe <hi>Scots</hi> which were the Queenes Enemies. The Duke interpoſeth, ſaying;
<q>BArham, doe not (I pray you) exaſperate the matter with words, in obiecting againſt me the marriage, and other things which fall not amongſt the offences of high Treaſon.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Barham,</hi> turning to the Peeres, vrgeth this: He (quoth he) that will marry a wife that layeth claime to a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, doth likewiſe affect the ſame Kingdome. For the Duke had enterprized the ſame, being amongſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners at <hi>Yorke,</hi> appointed for the hearing of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> Cauſe, being at that time bound by his oath, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ballance the accuſations and defences of either part.</p>
                     <p>The Duke replyeth,
<q>There be diuers parts contained in that cauſe, which are not crimes of <hi>Laeſae Maieſtatis.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Lord high Steward commanded the Duke not
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:7782:194"/>
to ſtray ſo farre from the purpoſe by digreſſions: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon (<hi>Barham</hi> clamorouſly inſiſting) he acknowledged that the Queene of <hi>Scots</hi> had laid claime to the Crowne of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but had long time ſince deſiſted. <hi>Barham</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary demonſtrated, that ſhee had not as yet deſiſted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe had not yet renounced the right which ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: hee furthermore grieuouſly accuſed the Duke, that he inſtructed the Deputies of the Queene of <hi>Scots</hi> what to anſwere, according as it appeared in the Confeſſion of the Biſhop of <hi>Roſse.</hi> The Duke confeſſed, that <hi>Lidington</hi> had made a motion to him of the marriage, but he refuſed the ſame, neither gaue he any inſtructions, but deſired that <hi>Roſſe</hi> might be produced in preſence.</p>
                     <p>After this, <hi>Barham</hi> amply proſecuteth many things of the marriage, which haue beene ſpoken of, with an intent to prooue that the Duke had an affection to the Kingdome, and inſiſteth with often-repeated Interrogatories. What other thing could the Duke propound to himſelfe,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The ſecond Article of his accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                        </note> whileſt (without the Queens knowledge) he determined to marry the Queene of <hi>Scots,</hi> being a woman without meanes or Kingdome (her Sonne being eſtabliſhed in the Kingdome) then that by her he hoped to enioy the Crowne of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and ſo conſequently depriue the Queene both of rule and life?</p>
                     <q>You haue <hi>(quoth the Duke)</hi> lowdly repeated theſe things, to conuince me of enterprizing the depoſing and ruine of the Queene.</q>
                     <p>To come to the point (ſayes <hi>Barham</hi>) it is ſufficiently knowne, that you haue conſulted about the ſurprizing of the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> which is the ſtrongeſt place in the Realme, whereby it is neceſſarily manifeſt, that you had then plotted the ruine of the Queene, ſeeing that Rule is impatient of competitors. The Duke denieth not, hat one <hi>Hopton</hi> ſuggeſted him to the ſurprizing of the Tower of
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:7782:194"/>
                        <hi>London,</hi> but he vtterly reiected it. Why then (quoth <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>) did you aske counſell of the Earle of <hi>Pembroke</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame, who diſſwaded you from it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Barham</hi> proceedeth, and vrgeth, that when the Queene of <hi>England</hi> had demanded that the young King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> certaine Caſtles, and the rebellious <hi>Engliſh</hi> which were in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhould be deliuered into her hands: The Duke had vnder-hand aduiſed the <hi>Scots,</hi> not to conſent thereunto. He likewiſe accuſed him, that hee endeuoured to free the Queene of <hi>Scots</hi> out of priſon; and that, after hee had reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly promiſed by his hand-writing, not to meddle with her in any kind of buſines.</p>
                     <p>One <hi>Candiſh</hi> was then produced for a witneſſe, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that the Duke had conſtantly reſolued of the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and had asked him, if (after the death of Queen ELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZABETH, he might draw his Vncle to his partie. Theſe the Duke altogether denyed, reiecting his teſtimony, as of a poore and abiect fellow. After this it was demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the Duke had ſecretly ſent a Seruant to the Earles of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſtmerland,</hi> to aduertiſe them, not to ſtir in the Rebellion, becauſe he thought it would be very dangerous. Letters alſo were brought in, which the Queene of <hi>Scots</hi> had written to the Duke, importing, that ſhee was much grieued that the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was apprehended before hee had taken vp Armes in the Rebellion: (For whether ſhee vnderſtood this by report, or it was inuented of purpoſe, I cannot ſay.)</p>
                     <p>To this the Duke anſwered:
<q>THat by theſe reaſons it could not probably bee inferred, that hee had laboured the deſtruction of the Queene; neither was any thing that hath hitherto bin produced, of any moment againſt him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the teſtimony of the Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe;</hi> and that
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:7782:195"/>
alſo of him being a forreiner (by the authoritie of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton,</hi> a man moſt expert in our Lawes) in no wiſe is to be admitted. That he neuer had <hi>Northumberland</hi> or <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> in ſuch eſteeme that hee would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his life into their hands: and that his innocencie was ſuch a ſure rampire to him, that hee neuer medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of any eſcape for himſelfe.</q>
                     </p>

                        </note>Then <hi>Gerard,</hi> the Queenes Attourney, ſpake: It is more than ſufficiently apparant, that the Duke would haue eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Queene of <hi>Scots,</hi> to deſtroy the Queene of <hi>England.</hi> The Letters which he hath writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Pope, the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and Duke <hi>d'Alua,</hi> doe iuſtifie that hee had a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to inuade <hi>England.</hi> That which hee conſulted of with <hi>Ridolfe,</hi> was now likewiſe openly knowne by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Characters which were found hidden vnder the tiles in the houſe of the <hi>Howards,</hi> and by the Letters alſo (which he commanded to be burnt) but were found at the entry of his Chamber vnder the Matte. And all theſe things may eaſily bee proued by the interrogatories and anſweres of them that haue not beene affrighted with torments, nor condemned to haue attempted ought againſt the State.</p>
                     <p>To which, the Duke replyed:
<q>
                           <hi>I</hi> Haue not <hi>(quoth hee)</hi> beene eyther author or fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the counſels and deliberations holden with the Pope or <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but to the contrary, I haue alwayes reproued and diſallowed them. Thoſe that haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, let them ſuffer, and not diſcharge them vpon me.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides all this, <hi>Gerard</hi> accuſed the Duke, that hee had conſulted with <hi>Ridolfe</hi> for the landing of tenne thouſand men out of <hi>Flanders</hi> at <hi>Harwich,</hi> a Port in <hi>Eſſex:</hi> and this was iuſtified out of the examination of <hi>Barker.</hi> That Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:7782:195"/>
were written by <hi>Ridolfe</hi> to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and Duke <hi>d'Alua</hi>; to which, although the Duke ſubſcribed not, yet by the counſell of <hi>Roſſe,</hi> hee ſent <hi>Barker</hi> his Secretary as Ambaſſadour, to auerre them to be the Dukes owne Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <q>MY memory <hi>(replyeth the Duke)</hi> beginneth to falter, neither can it containe ſuch an intricate varietie of matters: You other pleaders haue your notes and memorialls with you, but I muſt <hi>ex tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> anſwere to all mine accuſers.<note place="margin">The Duke of Norfolke contrary to the Romane Religion.</note> But ſurely it is not probable, that I who haue alwayes beene contrary to the Roman Religion, ſhould entertaine a treatie with the Pope. I had a great deale rather be torne in pieces with wilde Horſes, than to depart from the Religion which I profeſſe. Conſider but the ſituation of <hi>Harwich,</hi> and it will eaſily annihilate the accuſation. Who ſees not how difficult a thing it is, to leade an Armie thorow that part of the Countrey, which is round incloſed with hedges, and moſt incommodious, by reaſon of the ſtreight and narrow wayes and paſsages? Had I had a determination to rayſe an army againſt my Princeſſe, without doubt I would not haue beene vnprouided of Armes: but I haue not for theſe tenne yeeres paſt, bought any more than eight Corſlets; and for Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, not any at all. I neuer committed any Letters to the truſt of <hi>Barker,</hi> but rather of <hi>Baniſter,</hi> that was to mee more than many <hi>Barkers.</hi>
                     </q>
                     <p>Then were the intercepted Letters of the Biſhop of <hi>Roſse,</hi>

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:7782:196"/>
written with the Biſhops owne hand. Beſides theſe, a little Letter was brought forth, which the Duke had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Okar to one of his Seruants,<note place="margin">

<q>CErtes, it falls not vnder the power of my faculties, to frame a replication to ſuch an elegant and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Oration. Yet this Oratour, ſuch and ſo great as he is, hath omitted to ſpeake how great the violence of feare is, which oftentimes doth remoue a firme and wel-compoſed minde out of its place and ſtate.

<q>THomas, Duke of Norfolke, you are heere arraigned for diuers crimes of <hi>Laeſae Maieſtatis,</hi> and haue ſubmitted your ſelfe to God and theſe Peeres, by euery one of whom you are pronounced guiltie. Is there now any cauſe why Iudgement ſhould not be pronounced?</q>

But ſay in good ſooth, would you acknowledge that your ſubiects ſhould haue ſuch power ouer you? The regall power I had in the meane time, by your aide &amp; aduice, was taken from me, to be conferred on my ſonne, a yong child, by reaſon of his Infant-age vnfit to manage the adminiſtration of a Kingdome. And when as of late, I determined to make him a lawfull reſignation, for the certaine eſtabliſhing of him in the Kingdome, hee was by force of Armes caried violently away by Traitors; who, doubtleſſe had no other intent, then to depriue him (as they did me) of the Crowne, and perhaps of his life. After I got out of <hi>Lake-Leuin,</hi> and was to raiſe Armes for the ſuppreſsing of the Rebels, I ſent you then the Diamond, which formerly you had giuen me, as a pledge of mutuall loue betwixt vs, when you made me many large promiſes, and faithfull proteſtations to ſuccour and ſupport me againſt the Rebels, when alſo you promiſed, that if I ſhould come towards you, you would meet me in perſon vpon the frontiers, and would aſsiſt me. I relying vpon theſe promiſes ſo often and ſo ſeriouſly iterated (although your meſſengers had many times before deluded me) reſolued to reſort to you, as to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7782:282"/>
a Sanctuary. And aſſuredly, I had come, had I but found the way as open to me, and as eaſie to paſſe, as it was for thoſe who reuolted againſt me. But before I could come at you, I was arreſted vpon the way, guarded with troops of men, ſhut vp in ſtrong places, and ſince that time haue endured things worſe then death.</p>
                           <p>I know you will obiect ſome intercourſes of buſineſſe haue paſt betwixt the Duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> and me; but I aſſure you there hath neuer any thing paſt, preiudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to you or your Kingdome, as alſo your chiefe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors haue giuen approbation thereto, as I can proue, who likewiſe promiſed mee by the way of atteſtation to procure your conſent. And how I pray you ſhould theſe ſo great perſons promiſe your conſent to a thing which might deſpoile you of honour, life, and Diadem? And notwithſtanding, you would that euery one ſhould be ſo perſwaded.</p>
                           <p>Beſides, as diuers of the Rebels, by a tardy repentance re-aduiſing themſelues, and by a Commiſsion held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our Deputies at <hi>Yorke,</hi> vnderſtood how wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they had dealt with me, they being beſieged with your Souldiers in <hi>Edenburgh</hi>-Caſtle,<note place="margin">

                           <p>Since that, I had reſolued to try whether patience can haue power to conquer cruelty, in ſuffering all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities that can be impoſed on a poore Priſoner. All conference with my ſonne by Letters or Meſſengers, for this yeare, hath been denyed me, renting if it were poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the ſonne from the mother by a ſad ſeparation of ſpirits.</p>
                           <p>I haue often propounded Articles of peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord

to bee confirmed betwixt vs at <hi>Chateſworth</hi> by the moſt Chriſtian Kings Ambaſſadors eleuen yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, both to your Deputies, and to your ſelfe, and by my owne the laſt yeare, I dealt ſincerely with <hi>Beal.</hi> But theſe profers were ſtill reiected, delayes interpos'd, my beſt meaning euer ſuſpected, and the affection of my true-intending heart continually condemned. Nor haue I reaped any other fruit by my long ſuffering, but that by a Preſcription, I am dayly handled worſe and worſe, not indeed as a Priſoner, but as ſome abiect ſeruant of baſe condition. But truely I cannot longer endure theſe indignities, howſoeuer the matter ſhall fall out, if I die, I will manifeſt the Authors of my death; if I liue, I ſhall ſo effect (I hope) that the malicious practices of my Aduerſaries ſhall dye, and paſſe the remainder of my dayes in more tranquilitie.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore, to take away all occaſions of ſcandall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs, let the teſtimonies of the Spaniards, which were lately taken in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and all the examinations of the Ieſuites be produced againſt mee. Let mee be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned openly, come in who can to accuſe me, prouided withall I may haue the liberty to defend my ſelfe, and not be condemned before I be heard. The malefactors and vileſt Priſoners are permitted to defend themſelues and to confront their accuſers. Why then am I denyed this lawfull libertie, being an anointed Queene, your neareſt Kinſwoman, and the next lawfull heire to your Kingdome? But this laſt is that excruciates my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, whoſe chiefeſt ſtudies are bent to breed debate betwixt vs. Alas, alas! and why ſhould this vex or afflict my enemies, when as I proteſt before God, and on my honour, I haue not thought this long time of any Kingdome but that of heauen.

                           <p>Is there any iuſt dealing in this, that a Mother ſhould not be ſuffered to ſuccour her ſonne in diſtreſſe? nay, not ſo much as to be let vnderſtand how he doth? If ſuch as you ſent for my ſonnes good, had taken my aduice by the way, they would haue beene the welcomer to him, and I the more obliged to you; nor was there any reaſon you ſhould ſo long conceale their goings thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor then keepe mee ſo ſtraightly ſhut vp: but to ſpeake freely, I beſeech you let no more ſuch be imployed for <hi>Scotland.</hi> Thus much I dare promiſe my ſelfe, that <hi>Hunſdon</hi> will doe nothing but that ſtandeth with his honour, nor <hi>Huntingdon</hi> any thing may tend to my good, for that which he hath already practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt me.</p>
                           <p>I entreat you therefore by the bond of that conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinitie which is betwixt vs, to bee circumſpect for the ſafety of my ſonne, not to intermeddle your ſelfe with the buſineſſes of <hi>Scotland,</hi> before you haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with mee and the King of <hi>France,</hi> and hold all thoſe for Traitors which keepe my ſonne in hold, not ſuffering him to goe any where, but at their pleaſure. In fine, I coniure you by the Croſſe and Paſsion of Chriſt our Redeemer, that after ſo many yeares of deſolation, I hauing libertie, may vpon iuſt tearmes, be ſuffered to retire my poore weake body into ſome qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et place out of <hi>England,</hi> there to refreſh mee before my death, after the long and loathſome time of my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment. This doing, you ſhall eternally oblige vnto you me and mine, but aboue all my ſonne. Nor wil I euer

ceaſe to craue this, till you haue granted it me, my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition enforcing this importunity. Let mee be vſed hereafter a little more gently, otherwiſe I ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to endure; nor put mee off, to the diſpoſing of any, but of your ſelfe. What good or euill hereafter ſhall betyde me, I will impute all to you, vouchſafe mee this fauour, to let me know your pleaſure, either by your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or by the French Ambaſſador. I can repoſe no confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in thoſe things, which the Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> hath imparted vnto me, they are ſo mutable. I writ of late to your Councell, but you ſent me word, to acquaint none but your ſelfe with my buſineſſe: for there was no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in it, in giuing them ſo much power to afflict me. And I cannot apprehend it otherwiſe, but that ſome ill-willers of mine, were the occaſioners of it, for feare that others, duly conſidering my iuſt complaints, in regard of your honor, &amp; their duties, ſhould haue oppoſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. And now the laſt thing I am to deſire, is, that I may haue ſome reuerend Catholicke Prieſt to inſtruct me in Religion, for the ſaluation of my ſoule. This is a laſt duty not to be denyed to wretches of meaneſt ranck. You ſuffer the Ambaſſadors of foraigne Princes to vſe their Religion, and my ſelfe ſometimes haue granted toleration of ſeuerall profeſsions to my ſubiects: If this be denyed mee, I hope to bee excuſed before God, and I feare mine Aduerſaries ſhall not paſſe vnpuniſhed. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly it will be a preſident to other Chriſtian Princes to exerciſe the like ſeuerity amongſt their ſubiects of different Religions, if this bee offered me, an abſolute Princeſſe, &amp; of your neareſt alliance. As I am, I will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be affected to you, in deſpight of my Aduerſaries; and ſtomacke they me neuer ſo much. I deſire not to haue my family increaſed, but I vpon neceſsity intreat to retain two of my maid-ſeruants to attend me in my ſickneſſe: let not mine enemies aſſwage their cruelty
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7782:284" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vpon me, in cauſing me to bee denied ſo ſmall an office of humanity. Whereas I am taxed by the Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> to haue dealt otherwiſe (then I promiſed <hi>Beal</hi>) in ſurrendring my title in <hi>Scotland</hi> to my ſon, without your priuity: Beleeue not <hi>Beals</hi> ſuggeſtions, for I paſt no promiſe, but vpon certaine conditions, which I am not bound to performe on my part, vnleſſe they be performed on yours: I haue yet receiued no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thereof, and they haue beene long time ſilent; but for all that, in <hi>Scotland</hi> they haue not ceaſed their tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous practizes to the ruine both of me, and my ſon; I cannot take this long ſilence, but for a deniall, and ſo I haue certified your Councell by Letters. That which the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Queene his mother haue communicated to me, haue I ſincerely communicated to you, and required your aduice, but you haue not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed me one word in writing, or by word of mouth: I cannot before I ſhall know what it is, ſubmit my ſelfe to your Councell, concerning my affaires and Country; for that were extreame indiſcretion. You know how my Aduerſaries triumph in <hi>Scotland</hi> both ouer mee, and my impriſoned ſon: I haue attempted nothing in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to your preiudice, but to ſtabliſh a ſolide peace in the Realme, hauing by ſo much the more a greater care then your Councellors, by how much my intereſt there, is more then theirs. I haue deſired to gratifie my ſon with the title of King, to confirme him, and to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie all diſcords. Is that to take the Diadem from him? But the enemies of me, and my family, will not haue it confirmed: It is that that they dread, whilſt they carie in their heart a witneſſe againſt themſelues, &amp; finding themſelues culpable of euills apprehend they ſhould bee dealt with accordingly.</p>
                           <p>Let not theſe, and others my aduerſaries ſo blind your eyes, that during your life, and in your ſight, they ſhall
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7782:285"/>
beare downe your neareſt kindred, and ruinate both the Crownes: as to that end they are plotting villanies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, againſt my ſon, and perhaps againſt you alſo. Can it be any pleaſure, or honor to you, that I and my ſon, that you and we are by their meanes ſo long ſeelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and kept aſunder? Reſume your naturall goodneſſe and meekneſſe, oblige your ſelfe to your ſelfe, and ſeeing you are a Princeſſe, be tender hearted to me a Princeſſe, the neareſt of your conſanguinity, that all things being ſet in quiet betwixt vs, I may paſſe the more peacefully out of this life, and that the ſighes and ſobbes of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ſoule aſcend not to God on high. To whoſe diuine power I preſent my daily prayers, that theſe my iuſt complaints, and ſorrowfull laments my take place with you.</p>

                              <hi>She refuſeth her tryall.</hi>
                           </note>She was no ſubiect, and that ſhe would rather dye a thouſand deathes, than acknowledge her ſelfe to bee one, ſeeing that by ſuch acknowledgement, ſhee ſhould preiudice the ſoueraignty of her royall Maiesty, and become lyable to the Lawes of <hi>England,</hi> yea, in caſe of Religion: notwithstanding, ſhe was ready to anſwere to all things in open Court of Parliament, though ſhee knewe that this Convention was (for formalities ſake) purpoſely continued for the taking away of her life, already condemned in opinion. She wiſheth them to examine their owne conſciences, and to remember, that the ſpacious Theater of the world, was more than the Kingdome of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then ſhe began to complaine of ſome iniuries offered her: but the Treaſurer interrupting her, recited fauours which ſhe had receiued from her Maieſtie, namely, that ſhe had puniſhed ſome for impugning the title of her right to <hi>England,</hi> ſtayed the State when they would haue condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her for ſeeking to haue married with the Duke of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke, and for conſenting to the rebellion in the North.

                     <p>After a few houres Sir <hi>Aimé Poulet</hi> and the Sollicitor, preſented the Commiſsion, and the names of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners to her, that thereby ſhe might ſee, they were to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by no fraudulent, but a legall courſe in equity. As for
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7782:343"/>
the Commiſsioners, ſhe tooke no exception; but that ſhee excepted againſt, was the ſeuere new Law,<note place="margin">Exception againſt the new-made Law.</note> as vniuſt and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely deuiſed againſt her, and vpon which their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion depended, whereof they could ſhew no preſident: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would ſhe euer yeeld vnto it. She demanded by what Law they ſhould proceed, Ciuill or Canon? ſaying, they muſt ſend for Interpreters from <hi>Padua, Poytiers,</hi> and other outlandiſh Academies, becauſe there were none in <hi>England</hi> that vnderſtood them: adding further, that by the expreſſe words of the Queenes letters, it appeared ſhe ſtood already conuicted of diuers crimes, and condemned before ſhe was tryed; and therefore had no need to come before them to a ſecond hearing: but deſired to be reſolued of ſome ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſhe had found in the letters, yet would not deliuer them out in writing, becauſe (ſhee ſaid) it became not a Queene to play the Scribe.</p>
                     <p>For this cauſe the ſelected Commiſsioners went again to her, of whom ſhe deſired to know what theſe words meant;
<q>For that ſhe was vnder the Queenes protection.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which the Chancellor made anſwer:
<q>This was eaſie to be vnderstood by any; yet was it not the ſubiects part, to interprete their Soueraignes meaning, neyther were they come for that cauſe.</q>
She likewiſe required them, that they ſhould ſhew forth the Proteſtation, which once ſhe had made. But it was anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That it had not beene allowed, nor ſhould it be now: becauſe it was preiudiciall to the Realme of <hi>England.</hi> Then ſhe demanded by what authoritie they were to proceed. To whom it was anſwered, By the authoritie of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the Ciuill Law of <hi>England.</hi>
                        <q>But <hi>(ſayth ſhe)</hi> you make Lawes as you list, and I am not bound to ſubmit my ſelfe to them, ſeeing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> long ſince refuſed to be ſubiect to the <hi>Law-ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> of <hi>France:</hi> and that if they would proceed by the Ciuill law of <hi>England,</hi> they must produce examples,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7782:344"/>
for that, that Law conſisteth, for the most part, of preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and ancient customes. But if by the Canon Law, none but the founders therof ought to be the expoſitors.</q>
Anſwer was made, They would proceed neyther by the Ciuill, nor Canon, but by the Law of <hi>England:</hi> yet by the Caeſarian and Canon Law both, it was plaine (if ſhe would heare it) that ſhe ought to appeare. She refuſed not (ſhee ſaid) to heare them, by way of diſcourſe, but not iudiciarily.</p>
                     <p>From this ſhe fell into other ſpeeches: That ſhe neuer had any thought to deſtroy the Queene: That ſhe had been forced to endure many iniuries: That ſhe ſhould become a common ſtone of offence (if ſhe were thus ſtil abuſed:) That ſhe had offered to imploy <hi>Nauue,</hi> for the repealing of the Popes Bull, and that ſhe would ſundry times haue excuſed her innocencie (by letters) but was not permitted: finally, That all the offers of good-will, which ſhe had offered for twentie yeares ſpace, were ſtill reiected. As ſhe ſlipped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide by theſe prettie digreſsions, they brought her to the point, and intreated her to ſay plainly, whether ſhe would anſwer the Commiſsioners. She replyed;
<q>Their Commiſsion was grounded vpon the new Law, which was made to entangle her; hauing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore iust cauſe of ſuſpioion, ſhe could not endure it: and hauing alwayes carried a true heart, ſhe would not now treſpaſſe ſo much against the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> her ancestors, as to acknowledge her ſelfe a ſubiect to the Crowne of England. For what were that elſe, but to proclaim them rebells and traytors? notwithstanding ſhe refuſed not to anſwer, yet by no meanes in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a ſubiect; for that ſhee had rather periſh, than to anſwer as a malefactor.</q>

Shee deſired them to ſhew any thing vnder her owne hand, demanding withall, what hurt any had receiued by any letters which came to her for a whole yeare together.

                     <q>AS for theſe letters <hi>(ſaid ſhe)</hi> it may poſsibly be that <hi>Babington</hi> writ ſo: but let it be proued that I euer receiued them.

                     <p>To proue the receipt of <hi>Babingtons</hi> letters, there was read the principall points of the letters out of his confeſſion,<note place="margin">Extracts out of <hi>Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingtons</hi> confeſsion.</note> wherein he voluntarily granted, that ſhe had receiued them, and had written back againe; in which letters was mention made of the Earle of <hi>Arundell</hi> and his brethren, and of the Earle of <hi>Northumberland:</hi> which hearing, ſhe wept, &amp; ſaid:

If <hi>Ballard</hi> had offered me his ſeruice, I would not haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed it, but rather recompenced him for his paines.

This anſwer, as ſhe ſaid, ſatisfied her. And
<q>She deſired him he would not be offended at that which ſhe had heard by report; and that he would no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue her calumniations, than ſhee did his: for theſe pick-thankes are men of little credite, which pretend one thing, and ſay another; and that he would not by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meanes beleeue, that euer ſhe had conſpired the death of her dearest ſister the Queene.</q>

                     <p>The Lawyers anſwered, That would appeare by euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. This paſt in the forenoone.</p>
                     <p>In the afternoone, to proue this, they produced the copie of the letters which <hi>Charles Paget</hi> had written,<note place="margin">

                        </note>The Lawyers paſsing further, ſaid, That they could proue ſhe had conſpired the Queenes death, by the confeſsion of <hi>Babington,</hi> and letters of his; wherein he called her his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and moſt excellent Queene: as alſo out of thoſe ſhe had written vnto him; And by the way, put her in minde of conſultation had, how the kingdome of <hi>England</hi> was to be transferred to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King. She confeſſed, that once a Prieſt had viſited her, and ſaid, That if ſhe interpoſed not her ſelfe, her ſonne and ſhe both would be excluded from their inheritance: but ſhe would not name him. He added, That the <hi>Spaniard</hi> pretended a title to the crowne of <hi>England,</hi> and would yeeld to none but her. Then they preſſed her vpon <hi>Babingtons</hi> confeſsion, from the teſtimonies of her Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries <hi>Nauue</hi> and <hi>Curle,</hi> and letters written interchangeably betwixt them.<note place="margin">and the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of her Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> And though all the proofe was grounded vpon their bare aſſertions, yet were they neuer brought forth face to face. She confeſt <hi>Curle</hi> to be an honeſt fellow, but no fit witneſſe againſt her: That <hi>Nauue</hi> (ſometimes Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie to the Cardinall of <hi>Lorraine)</hi> had beene commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to her by the King of <hi>France,</hi> and that he might be eaſily drawne for money,<note place="margin">She obiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites.</note> hope or feare, to depoſe falſly; and had bound himſelfe thereto by a raſh oath, hauing <hi>Curle</hi> (a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of a flexible nature) at his command, to write what hee would. And it may be, they had put things into the letters which ſhe dictated not, &amp; poſſibly ſuch letters might come
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7782:348"/>
to their hands, which notwithſtanding ſhe neuer ſaw. Then ſhe broke into theſe or the like ſpeeches:
<q>THe ſtate of all Princes is at a weake ſtay, if they depend vpon the writings and teſtimonies of their Secretaries: for my part, I deliuered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to them, but what nature put into my minde for the recouery of my libertie; nor ought I to be conuicted, vnleſſe it be by mine owne words or writing. If they haue written any thing preiudiciall to the queene my ſister, they did it without my knowledge, and therefore let them be puniſhed for their inconſiderate inſolency. I know for certainty, that if they were preſent, they would cleere me in this caſe: and if I had my manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts here, I could anſwer all this particularly my ſelfe.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>With that the Treaſurer obiected,<note place="margin">Arguing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the kingdome.</note> that ſhee had determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſend her ſonne into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and to conuey to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> the right ſhe challenged to the Kingdome of <hi>England.</hi> Whereto ſhe anſwered:
<q>That ſhe had no kingdome to bestow, yet was it lawfull for her to giue her own at her pleaſure, neyther was ſhe to be accountable to any therefore.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And when they obiected further, out of <hi>Curles</hi> teſtimony, that ſhe had ſent her Alphabet to <hi>D. Lodowick</hi> and <hi>Fernhurſt,</hi> ſhe denied not,
<q>But ſhe had written out many of them: and amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that for D. <hi>Lodowick,</hi> after ſhe had reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended him and another to the honour of Cardinal. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, ſhe hoped, it was as lawfull for her to haue entercourſe of letters, for the diſpatch of her affayres with people of her own religion, as it was for the Queen with thoſe of another religion.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this, they vrged her againe vpon the euidences of <hi>Nauue</hi> and <hi>Curle,</hi> which agreed together: whereto ſhee ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7782:349"/>
replyed as before, or reiected them with a preciſe deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: proteſting againe, that ſhe neyther knew <hi>Babington</hi> nor <hi>Ballard.</hi> With this, the Treaſurer interrupting her, ſaid, That ſhe knew <hi>Morgan</hi> very well, who had ſecretly ſent <hi>Parry</hi> to ſlay the Queene, and that ſhe had giuen him an annuall pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

<q>She knew not that <hi>Morgan</hi> had done ſo, but ſhe knew well,<note place="margin">

                           </note> that he had lost all he had for her ſake, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſtood with her honour to relieue him: neyther was ſhe bound to reuenge the wrongs done to the Queen by one who had well deſerued from her; yet had ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes done her best to diſſwade him from ſuch wicked enterpriſes: ſaying withall, that out of <hi>England</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there were penſions giuen to <hi>Patrick Gray,</hi> and other Scotts,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>by penſions giuen to the Scottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Whereto the L. Treaſurer anſwered:
<q>Becauſe the treaſure of <hi>Scotland</hi> had beene much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payred, by the negligence of the Regents or Vice-royes, therefore the Queene had dealt the more bountifully with her neere kinſman your ſonne.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then was ſhewed ſome of the letters, which ſhee had written to <hi>Inglefield,</hi> to the Lo: <hi>Paget,</hi> and to <hi>Bernard Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doza,</hi> touching the forraigne ſupplies: but when ſhe had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that,
<q>That tended not to the ruine of the Queene, becauſe ſome ſtrangers had a deſire to procure her liberty; and that ſhe had manifested plainly enough to the Queene, that they ſought nothing but her freedome:</q>
the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was prorogued till the next day.</p>
                     <p>On the day following, ſhe reiterateth her proteſtation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, requiring to haue it recorded, and a copie thereof to be deliuered her: lamenting,
<q>That the most reaſonable conditions, which ſhe had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the Queene, were ſtill reiected, eſpecially hauing promiſed to deliuer her ſonne and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi>
                           <pb n="161" facs="tcp:7782:349"/>

                              <hi>She offereth the Duke of Guiſe and her ſonne pledges for her libertie.</hi>
                           </note> That ſhe her ſelfe (altogether excluded from all hope of liberty) was now most vnworthily handled, whoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reputation was called in question by common Lawyers, who, by their contorted arguments, make ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der circumstances matters of great conſequence; wheras anointed and conſecrated Princes are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to lawes, as priuate perſons. Moreouer, whereas the authoritie of their Commiſsion is to examine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters tending to the hurt of the Queens perſon, yet they ſo handled the matter, and ſo wrested their letters of Commiſsion, that they called in question the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhe profeſſeth, the immunitie and maiesty of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Princes, and the priuate commerce they haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themſelues by writing, and brought her to be arraigned at a Barre like a malefactor, to the preiudice of Maiestie and ſoueraigne dignitie: And this was done to no other end, but to bring her in diſgrace with the Queene, and to ſeclude her from the right of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance to the Kingdome.</q>
She called to mind withall,
<q>How Qu. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her ſelfe had bin questioned about <hi>Wyats</hi> rebellion, though ſhe were most innocent: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing most deuoutely, that notwithstanding ſhe wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Catholicks welfare, yet ſhee deſired not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement thereof by the ſlaughter or bloud of any one. She had rather play the part of <hi>Heſter</hi> than <hi>Iudith,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make interceſsion to God for the people, than take away the life of the meanest.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Expoſtulating the matter, ſhe complained that her aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries had bruited it abroad, that ſhe was of no religion:
<q>Which was that time, <hi>ſhe ſaid,</hi> when ſhe deſired to be informed of the Religion of the Protestants, but none would vouchſafe her the fauour; a ſigne they had little
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7782:350"/>
care of the ſafety of her ſoule.</q>
Then concluding:
<q>When you haue done all you can <hi>(ſaid ſhe)</hi> against me, you ſhall aduance your ſelues nothing in your cauſe or hope.</q>
And ſo inuocating God, and appealing to the Princes of her acquaintance, deſired ſhe might haue another day of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and that ſhe might be allowed an Aduocate to pleade her cauſe; and being a Queene, ſhe might be beleeued vpon her royall word:
<q>For it was extreme imprudence in her, to be arraigned before thoſe whom ſhe perceiued to be armed with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice against her.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this the Lo: Treaſurer made anſwer:

Your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were read, only to ſhew your practiſing againſt the queenes perſon, and ſuch other things as concerne the ſame; which are ſo intermixt, they cannot bee ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred:

therefore the letters were read wholly, and not in parts, to extract the particularities of the things you had intreated of with <hi>Babington.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>As he was thus ſpeaking, ſhe interrupted him, ſaying:

                              </note> but not the thing: That her ſincerity depended not vpon her Secretaries fidelity or memory, though ſhe knew them to be ingenuous. Or if for feare of puniſhment, or hope of profite and eſcape, they had confeſſed any thing, it was not to be admitted, for diuerſe good reaſons which ſhe had alleaged before. That the mindes of men are carried away with many paſsions: for her Secretaries would neuer haue confeſſed ſuch things, if eyther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite or ſome other hope had not induced them thereto. That the letters might be directed to others than them they were written to; and that oftentimes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things had beene inſerted that were not dictated.

And although there be no mortall aliue more bound to the Almighty, who hath ſo often and ſo miraculouſly deliuered me from eminent dangers; yet am I moſt of all for this, that after hauing gouerned this kingdome now the ſpace of 28 yeares, I doe finde in my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects the ſame, if not farre greater affection, than

when I came firſt to the Crowne: the which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire loue if I ſhould finde to fayle, I might well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps perceiue my ſelfe to breathe, but not to liue. And now my life hath bin attempted to be taken away, it grieueth mee moſt, that it was by ſuch a perſon as was of mine owne ſex, eſtate and ranke; to whom I was ſo farre from bearing ill will, that on the contrary, after ſhe had complotted diuerſe matters againſt me, I wrote to her in priuate, that if in any writing ſecretly ſhe would acknowledge them, I would bury them all in obliuion. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would I haue done this to entrap or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent her; for I knew already all ſhe could confeſſe: and although the matter was at that paſſe, yet if ſhe had but ſhewed her ſelfe truely penitent, none ſhould haue taken her cauſe (againſt me) in hand. Neuertheleſſe, if only it had concerned mine owne life, and not the ſafegard of my people (without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation be it ſpoken) I would willingly haue pardoned her. If England by my death might flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the more, or gaine a better Prince, I could bee well content to lay downe my life: for I deſire to liue onely for your good and the peoples. Neyther is there any cauſe (I haue ſo ledde my life) why I ſhould deſire life, or feare death.

When I ponder theſe things in minde, I ſee what the condition of the preſent time is, and I foreſee the future, thinking them the happieſt that ſooneſt depart hence. But againſt theſe, and ſuch like, I haue put on a warlike reſolution, that whatſoeuer ſhall happen, death ſhall not ſurpriſe me vnprouided.</p>
                           <p>As touching theſe late treaſons, I will not ſo much preiudice neither my ſelfe, nor the ancient lawes of my countrey in ſuch faſhion, as not to thinke this arch-treaſon to be ſubiect thereto, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this new had neuer bin made; the which (although ſome fauourers of her haue ſuſpected ſo) was not made againſt her, but was ſo far from entangling her, that rather it was an aduertiſement or preadmonition to her, not to come within the danger of it: neuertheleſſe ſeeing ſhe hath now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred the lawe, it is thought good to proceede againſt her by vertue thereof. But you, captious Lawyers, you are ſo preciſe, ſo curious in the quercks and quidities of law, &amp; to follow the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malitie of it, in ſtead of interpreting the true ſenſe, that forſooth according to the form of proceeding, ſhe ſhould be called to iudgment within the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Staffordſhire, there to appeare holding vp her hand at the Barre, to ſtand to the verdict of twelue men, vpon her fact. And is this a braue faſhion of proceeding againſt a Princeſſe? But I haue thought good rather (auoyding ſuch abſurdities) that it was
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7782:354"/>
more conuenient, to referre a matter of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the Peeres and Iudges of the Realme, to be examined. And yet hardly will that ſerue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the world haue their eyes vpon vs Princes, as if we were ſet vpon a Stage, and do marke afarre off the leaſt ſpot or blemiſh that is on vs: ſo that we had neede to be carefull, we do nothing vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming vs. But you haue by this new law brought me into ſuch a narrow ſtraite, that I am to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine vpon the puniſhment of a Princeſſe my next kinſwoman; whoſe practiſes haue afflicted mee with ſo great griefe, that, not to augment my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes in hearing it ſpoken of, I did willingly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent my ſelfe from this Parliament, &amp; not (as ſome thinke) for feare of treachery. Notwithſtanding I will not leaue (although I vſe few words of it) to put this ſecret out of my heart, which I haue ſeene with mine eyes, and read the oath, by which ſome haue bound themſelues to diſpatch me within one moneth. From hence I foreſee your danger in my perſon; and certainly I ſhall be carefull and diligent to repell it. I haue not forgot the combination you haue made for my ſafety, of which I neuer thought before I ſaw it confirmed vnder the ſignes &amp; ſeales of the moſt part of you: &amp; aſſuredly it hath bound me in ſtrict bonds of loue towards you perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who doe affect no greater comfort, than in the loue of you and the common-wealth. But for as much as the matter now in hand, is an example as

important, as rare; I deeme you expect not, that I ſhould reſolue any thing for the preſent: For My manner is, euen in things of leſſe conſequence, to be long in deliberating, about that I muſt once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue vpon.

Out of the great affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I bore her, it was, that I would haue ſome other means inuented, to haue preuented this miſchiefe: But becauſe it now clearly appeareth, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſafe, vnleſſe ſhee die; I am touched with a deepe dolour, to ſee that I, who haue ſhewed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to ſo many Rebels, wincked at ſo many trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries, ſhould at the laſt be ſeene to deale cruelly with ſo great a Princeſſe.</p>
                           <p>Since I tooke in hand the managing of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, I haue ſeene infamous Libells caſt out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Me, as a Tyrant. Much good may it doe the writers: I thought they would ſignifie ſom ſtrange thing, &amp; indeed it was ſtrange to Me, to be taxed of tyranny; I would it were as ſtrange to heare of their impietie. But now, what is it they will not put forth in their writings, when they ſhall know, that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7782:356"/>
I haue conſented that an executioner ſhall imbrue his hands in the blood of My neereſt Kinſwoman? And in the mean time, I am ſo farre from cruelty, that I would not to ſaue My life, doe her any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; nor haue I had ſo much care to prolong it, as (in the preſeruing of it) to preſerue hers, &amp; with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable griefe, that it cannot be ſo ſtill. I am not ſo ſenſeleſſe, as not to ſee the perils which lye before Me; ſo vnaduiſed, to whet the knif that ſhal cut My throat; nor ſo careleſſe not to reſpect My life: But I thinke with My Selfe, that there are many; which for the ſafeguard of a Prince's life, aduenture their owne; but I franckly confeſſe, I am none of that number. Theſe things haue I often caſt in My minde: But foraſmuch as diuers haue imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their tongues and pens againſt me, giue me leaue to defend My Selfe as I may, to the end you may ſee what a woman ſhee is, for whoſe well-fare you haue been ſo circumſpect. Certainly I doe well, and with gratitude of heart call your vigilant care to minde, but neuer ſhall be able to giue you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne thankes, although I ſhould liue as long as euery one of you.</p>
                           <p>So ſoone as I receiued the Scepter, being not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of God, who gaue me his grace, I begun my Raigne in his ſeruice, and the Religion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I was borne, and haue beene brought vp, and I hope ſhall die. And although I am not ignorant, how many ieopardies haue encompaſſed Mee at
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7782:357"/>
home; and how great Princes, for changing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, haue enuied Me abroad, yet haue I not beene moued thereat: For I know, that God, whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone I reſpect, will defend both Mee and My cauſe. From thence haue ſprung vp againſt Me, ſo many attempts and conſpiracies, that I wonder I liue; but God hath alwaies beene my ſuccour and ſupport, and ſent me aide beyond My expectation. Since that, to proue My ſelfe a Proficient in the Art of Raigning, I haue of long time bethought Mee, what things were fitting for Kings, and haue found, that nothing is more neceſſary, than to be plentifully furniſhed with the predominant Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of <hi>Iustice, Temperance, Wiſedome,</hi> and <hi>Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi> For the two laſt, which appertaine more properly to men, My ſexe permits Me not to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute them to my ſelf: but as for the two precedent, and the more mild, I dare ſay (without glorying) I haue with indifferency, conioyned the higheſt with the loweſt. I haue not preferred any vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily: Mine eares haue not beene too credulous; nor haue I (before I heard the cauſe) paſt my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment raſhly: yet I will not ſay, but many things perhaps haue bin brought by report to me, by ſom too partially affected to the Parties; <hi>For the good and wary Prince is often ſold, for that hee cannot heare euery Cauſe.</hi> My iudgement (the beſt it could) hath euermore inclined to the Truth; as he which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed his Friend to make no anſwer, before
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7782:357"/>
he had repeated the <hi>Alphabet</hi>; ſo haue I done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnaduiſedly.</p>
                           <p>As concerning therefore your Counſels &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations, I acknowledge them ſo elaborate, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and prouident for My conſeruation, iſſued from hearts ſo ſincere, and ſo well-affected to My ſeruice, that it is My part to endeuour with all My power, not to be vnthankfull to men of ſo great demerit. But as concerning your demand, I intreat and charge you, to hold you content with an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer without Anſwer.

Let the moſt gracious affection which I beare you be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and pleaſing to you; and withall this Anſwer, if ſo be you eſteeme it an Anſwer. If I ſay I will not do your demand, perhaps I ſhall ſay more than I thinke: If that I will; I (whom you would ſo gladly preſerue) ſhall runne headlong vpon mine owne deſtruction.

                        <p>Firſt, that when her Aduerſaries were glutted in her innocent blood, her Body might be carried from thence by her owne ſeruants to ſome ſacred and hallowed ground, there to be buried; and aboue all, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to France, where her Mother lyeth in reſt, ſeeing that in Scotland they had offered violence to the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of her Anceſtors, profaned or ruinated the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: and in England, ſhe could not hope for any buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all according to the Catholike ſolemnities, amongst the ancient Kings, both their Anceſtors: And ſo her Body that neuer had reſt ſo long as it liued with her Soule, may haue ſome at laſt after it is parted from it.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, (for that ſhe feared the cloſe tyrannie of ſome) ſhe may not ſuffer her puniſhment vnknowne to the Queene of England, in ſome ſecret place, but in the ſight of her ſeruants, and other people, which may truly beare witneſſe of the Faith which ſhe ſhewed in Chriſt, of her obedience to the Church, and of the end of her life, againſt the falſe rumors which her Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries may bruit abroad.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, that her ſeruants may be ſuffered peaceably to depart whither they will; and to enioy the goods ſhe had bequeathed them by her Will.

againſt thoſe to whom they are imployed in Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, are not culpable of treaſon, much leſſe the Princes themſelues: and that the will ought not to be puniſhed, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it take effect. That it was a thing neuer heard of, for a Queene to paſſe vnder the hands of a common executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. That ſhe was condemned contrary to the law of God, the <hi>Romane</hi> Ciuill Law, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; yea, euen againſt the Statute of the Parliament <hi>Anno</hi> 13. of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it was ordained, That no perſon ſhould be called into iudgement for hauing attempted the ruine of the Prince, but vpon the teſtimonie and oath of two lawfull witneſſes, who ſhould be brought face to face before the accuſed; and in her trial no witnes was produced againſt her, but ſhe was condemned from the teſtimony of two Secretaries abſent. They diſcourſed diuerſly alſo of the credite that was to bee giuen to domeſtick ſeruants, being priſoners: They much commended the ſpeech of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour: <hi>Testibus, non testimonijs credendum,</hi> That wee ſhould rather truſt the the witneſſors, than the witneſſes. Others priuately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that Spyes or Intelligencers had beene ſuborned, who by forgerie, falſe letters, and deceitfull ſleights had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded this Princeſſe expoſed to iniuries, had preuented her purpoſes, encouraged her to bad matters, of which ſhee had not ſo much as once thought, had ſhe beene kept as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, and if ſuch fraudulent Machinators had not beene put to her to that purpoſe. That it hath beene a familiar thing in all ages, for thoſe that are enuyed by Courtiers, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen againſt their wills to be brought into treaſon, and to heape more dangers (more treacherouſly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) vpon the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, being once reſtrained of liberty.</p>
                     <p>Others thought that ſhe was not a free and abſolute Qu.<note place="margin">Againſt her.</note> but only titulary, becauſe ſhee had forſaken her kingdomes gouernement, and was vnder the protection of the queene of <hi>England,</hi> ſo ſoone as ſhe was come within the kingdome: and as in doing well ſhe had taſted the benefite of the Law,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7782:360"/>
ſo in doing ill, ſhe was ſubiect to the rigour thereof; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lawyers Maxime:
<q>He deſerueth no benefite of the Law, which treſpaſſeth againſt the Law.</q>
Otherwiſe the condition of a ſtranger-king, offending with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the countrey of another, ſhould be better than of him which raigneth well: That ſhe was a ſubiect temporally, but not originally; becauſe that in reſpect of regall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, there cannot be two abſolute Princes together in one Kingdom: That by the common receiued opinion of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
<q>The king out of his Territories is a priuate man, except in expedition of warre: and therefore can neyther conferre nor exerciſe the royall Rights.</q>
Beſides that, that ſhe had loſt her ſoueraignety of Empire by her treſpaſſe: and that thoſe which are ſubiect to a King by reaſon of <hi>domicile,</hi> may commit treaſon. As touching the parentage, there is no neerer kindred than our country; for that it is a ſecond Diuinity, and our firſt and greateſt parent. As touching the promiſes of the duties of humanitie and hoſpitalitie, theſe are no priuiledges to commit euills vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed: That promiſes are to be vnderſtood ſo long as things remain in the ſame eſtate, and are not changed. That he which hath committed a crime, deſerueth not to enioy any promiſed ſecurity, and the rights of hoſpitalitie as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred: but our countrey is more ſacred. That the Prince, no more than the Pope, neuer bindeth his hands, and that all Princes are more neerely obliged to their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealths, than to their promiſes. That if they ſhould proceed with her, as with a priſoner in warre, they obiect I know not out of what author,
<q>
                           <pb n="183" facs="tcp:7782:360"/>That onely captiues are to be pardoned, from whom we can ſuſpect no disturbance of the peace; and no others.</q>
And that euery one hath power ouer his equall, alwayes and when the equall ſubmitteth himſelfe to his iudgement, eyther expreſſely by word, or ſecretly by contract, or elſe by offending within his iuriſdiction. That the Pope had cut off the ſentence giuen by the Emperour againſt <hi>Rob.</hi> King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> becauſe the fact was not committed within the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours dominions, but within the Popes. That by the law of Nations, Ambaſſadors haue beene ſo fauoured for the neceſsity of their Ambaſſages, as not to be violated: but Kings which treſpaſſe in the countrey of another, haue no ſuch graunt. Finally, that in matter of treaſon, the will, though wanting effect, is puniſhable: and to practiſe the death of the Prince, nay to know of the practice, &amp; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale it, is held for treaſon. That many Kings haue beene condemned and puniſhed, as namely <hi>Reſcuporis</hi> of <hi>Thrace,</hi> by <hi>Tiberius, Licinius</hi> &amp; <hi>Maximinianus</hi> by <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Italy, Conrade</hi> of <hi>Sicily,</hi> &amp;c. And that which is the ſumme of all, The ſoueraigne Law is the ſafetie of the people: now no law more ſoueraigne, than the welfare of the Common-wealth. And that <hi>Iupiter</hi> himſelfe made this law, That whatſoeuer is for the commodious good of the Common-wealth, is lawfull and iuſt. On the contrary, that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> haue put to death ſome Eccleſiaſticall Princes, not for the ſafeguard of the Common-wealth ſo much, as for their owne particular: as <hi>Boniface</hi> the eightth put to death <hi>Celestine</hi> the fift, depoſed from the Papacy, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that he ſhould be called againe, becauſe of his ſingular piety: <hi>Vrban</hi> the ſixt, who cauſed fiue Cardinalls to be ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp in ſackes, and caſt into the Sea, beheaded ſome, and two others he cauſed to be baked in an Ouen; and for the more terror, commanded they ſhould be laid on Mules, and carried about the countrey. Moreouer that Secretaries are not to be held for ſeruants, and that domeſtick witneſſe is to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7782:361"/>
be admitted for proofe of ſecret things done in the houſe. And it was argued vpon, whether the accuſers which haue ſworn voluntarily, and thoſe which are ſuſpected of crimes, ought to come face to face in criminall matters, to maintain the accuſation.

Whether by the word of God any thing may iustly be enacted by law against thoſe, whom God hath establiſhed for the administration of iustice; whom be vouch ſafeth to call gods vpon earth, whom he hath anoynted, whom he hath forbid to touch, becauſe they are his anoynted, and whom he will not permit to ſuffer wrong vnreuenged. How monſtrous a thing were it that an abſolute Prince ſhould be ſubiect to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſubiects: How prodigious, that an entyre Prince ſhould leade the way, to giue ſuch a detestable example, to prophane the diadems of others: What ſhould inforce her to this bloody cruelty? Honour, or profit? If honour, then might ſhe acquire more and greater in pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; for ſo (to her eternall glory for her clemency) ſhould ſhe binde to her for this benefite, both Him and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7782:362"/>
all the Kings of Christendome, whoſe affection other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhe ſhould loſe, together with her reputation, and brand her ſelfe with the marke of cruelty. If profite, it is to be conſidered, whether any thing can be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted profitable, but that which is iust and honest. And then concluded, in deſiring her to ſend ſuch an anſwer by his Ambaſſadors as ſhould be welbeſeeming ſo pious a Princeſſe, and not vnworthy for ſuch a King as was her most affectionate kinſman.</q>
But theſe Ambaſſadors, intermingling tempeſtiue menaces with their meſſages, were not pleaſing: and ſo taking their leaue, ſome few dayes after returned back, carrying with them as little comfort as hope.</p>

                           <p>That if ſhe were innocent, ſhe ought not to be puniſhed: if culpable, ſhe ſhould be pardoned, becauſe that would redound to the greater honour and profite, and would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine an eternall example of the Engliſh clemency.

                           <p>Finally, they required ſhe ſhould not be handled with ſuch rigorous and extraordinary iudgement: for if ſhee were, the King of France could not but take it as a moſt grieuous offence, howſoeuer the other Princes tooke it.</p>

When the Earles were departed, ſhee called in for ſupper, the better after to diſpoſe of her buſineſſes.

And to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> by her Letters ſhe recommended her Seruants. This done, ſhe reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red herſelf at her ordinary time to her reſt, ſlept a few hours; and awaking, paſt the reſt of the night away in Prayers.</p>

of her Seruants) falling on his knees, and pouring forth teares, bewailed his vnlucky fortune, that he was deſign'd the man, that ſhould carry into <hi>Scotland</hi> the ſad meſſage of the tragicall death of his deareſt Miſtreſſe.

Then the Noblemen, the two Earles, and the Sherife of the Shire going before, ſhe came to the Scaffold, the which was built at the vpper end of the Hall, vpon the which was a Chaire, a Cuſhion, and a Blocke, all couered with blacke. So ſoone as ſhe was ſet, and ſilence commanded, <hi>Beal</hi> read the Warrant or Mandate, to which ſhe liſtened attentiuely, as if it had beene ſome other thing. Then Doctor <hi>Fletcher</hi> (Deane of <hi>Peterborough</hi>) made a large diſcourſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of her life paſt, and preſent, and of the life to come.

Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney generall, accuſed <hi>William Dauiſon</hi> of contempt againſt her Maieſtie, of the breach of his allegeance, the neglect and omiſſion of his dutie; for that the queene of <hi>England,</hi> out of her royall clemency, being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing that the queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> (although ſhee ſtood condemned) ſhould be put to death, for certaine cauſes beſt knowne to her ſelfe, ſuch as were not to bee ſounded into by any others, nor could be drawne from her, eyther by the importunate vrging of the States of the land, or by her Councell: notwithſtanding ſhee had commanded the Warrant for her execution to be drawne (for the preuenting of ſome eminent pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils) the which ſhe committed to the ſaid <hi>William Dauiſons</hi> truſt and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citurnitie; he, being a ſworne Secretary, forgetfull of his faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, (contemning her Maieſties command) had imparted the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>William Dauiſon</hi> (ſuch was his ſingular modeſty) anſwered temperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and yet with audacitie;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That he was very ſory, that he ſhould be thus troubleſome to Commiſsioners, concerning the Q. of Scotland and the iudgement giuen againſt her (moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, if it were) to the impeachment of his credite, if not to the finall loſſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7782:374"/>
which to him was all in all. But this most grieued him, to be taxed of contempt againſt her Maieſtie; to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for her Princely fauours, he was ſo obliged, that his offence muſt thereby be the more intolerable. That hee confeſſed himſelfe guilty of the crimes obiected against him. That he had made ſhipwrack of his credite, which hee reckoned equiualent with his life. If in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Apologie, he ſhould conteſt with the Queen, he ſhould do that which were moſt vnbeſeeming the obedience of a ſubiect, the reſpect of a ſeruant, and the fidelity and reputation of a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary.</hi> He proteſted before God and the Commiſsioners, <hi>That he had done nothing therein wittingly and willingly, but what he was perſwaded was the Queenes will and pleaſure; wherein if by ignorance or negligence he had done any thing preiudiciall, he could not but for that be ſory, and ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the cenſure of the Commiſsioners.</hi>

                     <p>Now as touching the particulars: Whereas the Queene blamed him for hauing beene ouer-haſty in ſetting the great ſeale to the Mandate, he auouched;
<q>That ſhe had darkely ſignified, but not expreſſely commanded that he ſhould keepe it by him: Neyther, as hee thought, had hee treſpaſſed in matter of ſecrecie; for that he had not imparted it to any but the Councell. As touching that, that he did not reuoke the Warrant, after the Queene had giuen him to vnderſtand that ſhee had altered her minde; he affirmed, That it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed vpon by the generall conſent of the Councell, that forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it ſhould be ſent away, and the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, for feare the Queene or State might be indangered or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified.</q>

<q>That as he was vnwilling to contest against the Qu. ſo was he

                     <p>Sir <hi>Edmund Anderſon</hi> argued, that he had done right, but not rightly; otherwiſe the man was honeſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gerard</hi> was of the ſame opinion.</p>

But he cleered <hi>Dauiſon</hi> of malice, yet reproued him, as hauing beene inconſiderate in Princes affaires, and too forward in preuenting the queenes determination. And, for a caueat hereafter to men of his ranke and place, not to commit the like errour; accorded with the reſt concerning his fine and impriſonment.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Iacob Croft</hi> checkt and chid him, for hauing vnwiſely vttered the things which he ought to haue concealed, for that Princes impart that to ſome one of their Councell, which they conceale from the reſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> Baron <hi>Lumley</hi> was of opinion (with the Iudges) that the ſentence againſt the Qu. of <hi>Scotland</hi> was iuſtly giuen, yet ſeriouſly auerred, That in the memory of the precedent times, it was neuer heard or read, ſo high a contempt to haue beene committed againſt a Prince, that the Lords of the Councell, in the queenes houſe, at the Councell Table where her Maieſtie was (as it were Preſident of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell) ſhould haue decreed ſuch a buſineſſe, and that without her priuity, they (and <hi>Dauiſon</hi> too) hauing free acceſſe vnto her when they pleaſed; proteſting, That if he had but one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſonne that were faulty in ſuch a fact, he ſhould think him worthy to be very ſeuerely puniſhed. But being perſwaded of the honeſt diſpoſition of the man, he would cenſure him no deeper than others did.</p>

That he bewrayed ſecrets, and concealed from the Q. the ſending away of the Warrant. But what was this Qu. he was ſo buſie to make away? Was it not ſhee (I pray you) by whoſe life

our religion the queene, the kingdome, and euery one of vs were in continuall danger? yet it is for her being ſo cut off, that wee haue this dayes buſineſſe in hand. Now my opinion is, That he which hath deliuered our England from ſo great euills, deſerues to be royally recompenced. I do not thinke him to haue reuealed any ſecrets, for hauing imparted the matter onely to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, (and Magiſtrates appointed for matters of State,) whom chiefly it concerned to vnderſtand that and ſuch like, and which the queene her ſelfe before had vttered to two or three. If</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſon <hi>haue offended in any thing, it is chiefly in this, That the queene meaning to take another courſe, he told her not that the Warrant was already ſent away. But questionleſſe he was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen into a double doubt: whether to loſe the queenes fauour, in ſending away the Warrant without her knowledge; or by recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it, to bring new plots and perills to the queene. Who remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth not how turbulent the time was? what fearfull rumours were euery where diſperſed? If any wrong or violence had then hapned to the queene or religion, whileſt the Mandate was in his hands, had not the fault truly beene in him? Should not we, our wiues, and children, haue falne furiouſly vpon him? Should we not haue imbrued our hands in his blood? haue curſt his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, and haue erected, to his eternall ignominy, a trophee of indiſcretion, engrauen in letters of blood? What mulct or penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſoeuer you impoſe vpon him, ſhall not diſpleaſe me; but ſurely I will alwayes hold him for an honest man.</hi> This is the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor-like ſpeech, which we heard the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> made, and deliuered with a good grace and manly countenance.</p>
                     <p>The three Earles agreed in opinion with the reſt, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the premiſed penaltie inflicted vpon <hi>Dauiſon,</hi> and with the Lo: <hi>Gray,</hi> touching his reputation.</p>

                     <p>Laſtly, Sir <hi>Christ Wray</hi> (Lord Keeper of the priuy Seale) hauing made a briefe recapitulation of all the Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners opinions, confirmed the penaltie impoſed by them,<note place="margin">Sentence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen againſt him.</note> and declared, That although the queene (being iuſtly moued to diſpleaſure) had ſubmitted her Counſellors to examination, yet notwithſtanding ſhe did then pardon them; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, that what they had done, was from a deſire and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne tending to the defence of Religion and the State, and the repelling of eminent dangers.</p>
                     <p>

                           <hi>The reaſon why.</hi>
                        </note> they ſuggeſted that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Nauy was neither in number, greatneſſe, nor ſtrength, comparable to the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> (the <hi>Portugall</hi> Fleet being then added.) That <hi>England</hi> was altogether vnfortified, neyther was it furniſhed with Commanders, Souldiers, Horſe, or prouiſion for warres, but deſtitute both of friends and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; beſides, there were many through the Kingdome, which were addicted to Papiſtrie, and would ſoone ioyne themſelues in his ayde. Laſt of all, ſo great were the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> both by Sea and Land, and the vertue of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſuch, that none would dare to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, and therefore they promiſed aſſuredly a certaine victory. To this enterpriſe alſo, that God had preſented a fit opportunity: for the Turke hauing then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded a truce with him, and the <hi>French</hi> beeing intangled with inteſtine warres, were neither to be doubted or feared. That it was more facile to ſubdue <hi>England</hi> than the Low-Countries; becauſe the paſſage out of <hi>Spaine</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> is more ſhort and commodious, and through a vaſt and open Sea, but into the <hi>Netherlands</hi> of greater length and difficultie, through a narrow Sea, and very neere adiacent to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> That the <hi>Netherlands</hi> were in a manner continually a ſtrong Bulwarke, being on all parts fortified with Townes and Caſtles, but <hi>England</hi> not with any; and therefore it would be an eaſie matter euen at the firſt, in an inſtant, for him to penetrate to the very heart of the Land with an Army. Finally, according to that military Axiome: <hi>That the Enemy ſhould not be left behinde</hi>; therefore it was moſt neceſſary for the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to ſubdue <hi>England,</hi> being a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

Aluarus Baſſanus,</hi> Marqueſſe of <hi>Santa Croix,</hi> Generall of the Nauy, was of a minde; That before all, ſome Port or other in <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>Zealand,</hi> ſhould by thoſe Land-troupes which the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> had, and ſome few <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships ſent before, be vnawares to them ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, where the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleete might make their retreate, and from thence moſt opportunely begin the inuaſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Sea, being tempeſtuous, the windes are ſubiect to often changing, the ebbing and flowing thereof principally to be obſerued, the Fleete could not ſafely ride. Of this aduice likewiſe was the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> who earneſtly vrged this expedition. Others not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding diſallowed thereof, as being a thing diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, full of danger, requiring much time, great labour, large expence, yet vncertaine of ſucceſſe; neyther could it be done ſecretly or vnawares, and by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would eaſily be hindred and fruſtrated. And theſe were of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; That one might at leſſe charges, and with more faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, aſſault and ſubdue <hi>England,</hi> if at the mouth of the <hi>Thames</hi> a puiſſant Army of <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Flemmings</hi> were placed and conuayed in a powerfull Nauy, to take at the firſt (vnawares) the City of <hi>London,</hi> the Capitall and Chiefe of the Kingdome.

That hee had counſelled the King to treate of that peace which would be more profitable to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> than to the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; for, (quoth hee) if the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> be ouercome, they can eaſily recouer their loſſe again:
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:7782:391"/>
but if you be once vanquiſhed, your Kingdome is vtterly loſt. Whereupon Doctor <hi>Dale</hi> replyed, That the Queene was powerfull enough to defend her Kingdome, and that himſelfe might well iudge, according to his graue wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that ſhee could not eaſily be ouerthrowne by the loſſe of one battell, ſeeing the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> himſelfe, by ſo long a warre, could not as yet recouer the inheritance of his Anceſtors in the Low-Countries.
