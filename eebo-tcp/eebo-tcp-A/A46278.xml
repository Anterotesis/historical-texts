         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all flourishing Kingdoms throughout the
Universe (especially Islands) honest Merchants
and useful Merchandize have been ever had
in a reverential Esteem. Their <hi>Profession</hi> in all
former Ages highly magnified, and their
<hi>Persons</hi> honourably valued: In that by their
Cost, Adventures, Diligence, and Vigilance,
<hi>incognite Countries</hi> have been discovered, <hi>Royal
Amity</hi> introduced and confirmed with Transmarine Estates and
Princes: As also (by reason of their generous <hi>Examples,</hi> and
prevalent <hi>Perswasions</hi>) very brutish Nations, with barbarous
Natures, have been reduced to Meekness, Order, and Civility.
By <hi>Merchants,</hi> all Exotick Commodities from every Part of the
World are made communicable in Traffick with us, whose
numerous Varieties, pleasant Rarities, and substantial Necessaries,
serve both for Delight and Profit to the Crown and Kingdom.
They increase <hi>Shipping,</hi> multiply <hi>Navigators,</hi> and employ all
<hi>Handicrafts.</hi> Many of them have not only been the Erectors
of stately <hi>Structures,</hi> but the Founders of great and famous
<hi>Cities.</hi> What may be said of Merchants and their Trafficks,
their Antiquity, Dignity, Magnanimity, Generosity and Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banity,
is fitter to fill a Volume, than to be contracted in the
narrow Bondage of a compendious Epistle.</p>
            <p>Therefore since Your Lordship hath so ample an Interest in this
precedent Character, it is an especial Act of <hi>Almighty Providence,</hi>
to indulge and dignifie this Honourable City with such an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
<hi>Magistrate,</hi> whose <hi>Examples</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi> are both
prudent and pious, and may justly provoke all Persons under Your
Government to be <hi>regular</hi> and <hi>obedient;</hi> which although but for
One Year, yet is the <hi>Epitome</hi> of a Life-time: Thorow which,
