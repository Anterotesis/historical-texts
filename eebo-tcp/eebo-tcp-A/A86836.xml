            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon what reaſon doe you preſent this Petition in the name of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the foure Innes of Court?</p>
            <p>Anſ. My meaning was; becauſe the Gentlemen of the Innes of Court, having lately appeared before the face of the Court, to preſerve the Kings perſon, according to their allegiance, his Majeſty being in emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger, as they conceived, which might not ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eme al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together conformable in theſe turbulent times, being not invoked by publick authority, therefore I deemed it not much incongruent for me; having been a member of that Society, to make my addreſſe unto this honorable Houſe, without their eſpeciall advice, by preferring an humble Petition, which might manifeſt a perfect intention of their true devotion, both towards your Honourable Aſſembly; as alſo unto their country.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why did you not take the advice of ſome particular friends, or of ſome one Innes of Court rather then the generall, and for all the Proteſtants of England?</p>
            <p>Anſ. My meaning was, becauſe I did conceive that
<pb facs="tcp:125563:4"/>the Petition being univerſall and concerning all the loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Proteſtants of this Kingdome, it required a generall counſell of the whole foure Innes of Court; that therby through a perfect and judicious judgement it might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the better influence from the whole Kingdome, upon whoſe Counſell this Nation doth moſt depend.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Queſt.</hi> What do you meane by the reflection upon the divine ſervice of God?</p>
            <p>Anſ. My intention was that the divine ſervice of God might bee duly executed, by reaſon of our daily ſchiſmatical interruptions, frequently appearing in ſome of our Churches, manifeſtly repugning the Proteſtant profeſſed faith in our Religion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Queſt.</hi> What do you meane by the two extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of zeale?</p>
            <p>Anſ. My meaning was Jeſuits and Browniſts.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Doe you not thinke that we have as much care to preſerve the Kings perſon as you, what doe you meane by that?</p>
            <p>Anſ. My meaning was, that you would be pleaſed to appoint an eſpeciall guard to preſerve the Kings perſon, by reaſon of the multitude of people which paſſe by the Court gate in troops, with acclamations, and in a tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous manner.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Queſt.</hi> What do you intend by the Kings immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities?</p>
            <p>Anſ. My meaning was, all the Kings Regall dignities, it being the glory of our Nation.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Do you intend by ſettling things as they were in <hi>Queene Elizabeths</hi> and King <hi>Iames</hi> his dayes, to abrogate thoſe Lawes which we have enacted in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament?</p>
            <p>Anſw. God forbid: but my meaning was, that you
<pb facs="tcp:125563:4"/>would be pleaſed to ſettle us in that happy peace among us which our Predeceſſors moſt happily enjoyed in thoſe precedent dayes both with our King and Country, without any impeachment or diminution of thoſe lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable and worthy Lawes by your Honourable Houſe hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Queſt.</hi> What doe you mean by the peace of your conſcience?</p>
            <p>Anſ. My meaning was, that being devoutly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the divine ſervice of God, wee might not be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in our devotions by the Papiſts and Separatiſts.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Queſt.</hi> What doe you intend by the defacing of Learning?</p>
            <p>Anſw. My meaning was, the manifeſt and daily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts which our honeſt and learned Divines ſuſtaine by ſchiſmaticall perſons, both in the Church and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like places, to the great diſhonour and diſ-repuration of Learning.</p>

            <p>Anſw. My meaning was, that Doctors and Coblers might not be equall competitors, but that the Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler might not goe beyond his Laſt.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Queſt.</hi> What doe you intend by Separatiſts?</p>

            <p n="12">12. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why doe you endeavour to introduce the Gentlemen of the Innes of Court to petition for the Traine Band, and double Watches?</p>
            <p>Anſ. My meaning was, becauſe the Gentlemen of the Innes of Court having the cuſtody of many and great
<pb facs="tcp:125563:5"/>eſtates, ought to endeavour a generall pacification, that thereby the Traine Bands, and extraordinary Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches may as well be relieved from their chargeable and carefull attendance, as we of our continuall feare with dangerous tumults.</p>
            <p n="13">13. <hi>Queſt.</hi> What doe you intend by free debate in Parliament, without interruption or fear of puniſhment?</p>
            <p>Anſ. My meaning was, that there may be ſome on the behalfe of the Petition admitted to a liberall and free diſcourſe before the Parliament, concerning the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, without feare of puniſhment.</p>
            <p n="14">14. <hi>Queſt.</hi> What doe you intend by the valiant and renowned acts of your predeceſſors?</p>
            <p>Anſ. My meaning was, but onely a lively expreſſion, to retaine the dignity of our Nation.</p>
            <p n="15">
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 15. What doe you meane by this Proteſt?</p>
            <p>Anſ. My meaning was, no more but to teſtifie my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, and the reality of my heart to ſerve my God, my King, and Country.</p>
            <p n="16">16. <hi>Quest.</hi> What advice and counſell had you to draw up this Petition, and is this your true Copy?</p>
            <p>Anſ. I doe confeſſe this to be my true Copy, and doe moſt ſeriouſly proteſt, that I had neither counſell nor advice from any man towards the contriving, either of the heads thereof, or this rough and impoliſhed draught; and I take God to witneſſe, the publication thereof was never. Intended without a generall and exact counſell vpon every particular, that thereby it might appeare lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable before God and man; and therefore I humbly crave and beſeech your favourable conſtruction of this looſe Paper, ſubmitting my ſelfe in all humility to the grave wiſdomes of your Honourable Aſſembly; and with a cheerfull heart ready to ſacrifice my life and fortune at your commands.</p>
