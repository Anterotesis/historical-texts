         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

makes us give you now a Narration of a blessed Victory
which God hath given us upon the Army of the Cavaliers,
and of those evill persons, who upon Sunday, the 23. of this
instant, ingaged his Majesty in a dangerous and bloody fight
against his faithfull Subjects, in the Army raised by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Parliament,</hi> for the preservation of his Crowne and
Kingdome; Wee marched from <hi>Worcester,</hi> Wednesday the 19.
upon Intelligence that the Army was moved from <hi>Shrewesbury,</hi>
and <hi>Bridgenorth,</hi> and bending Southward; our Train of Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
was so unready, through want of draught Horses, and
through our omission of Monsieur <hi>du Boys,</hi> that we were forced
to leave it behind to follow us, and with it the Regiments of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
<hi>Hambden,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Grantham;</hi> and staying for it, wee
could advance no further then to a little Market-towne, called
<hi>Kyneton</hi> in <hi>Warwickeshire,</hi> sixe miles from <hi>Warwicke,</hi> whither
we came the Saturday night, with 11. Regiments of Foot,
42. troops of Horse, and about 700. Dragoones, in all about ten
thousand men; there we intended to rest the Sabbath day, and
the rather, that our Artillery, and the Forces left with it, might
come up to us. In the morning, when we were going to Church,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96804:3"/>
we had Newes brought us, That the Enemy was two miles from
us, upon a high Hill, called <hi>Edge-hill;</hi> whereupon wee presently
marched forth into a great broad field under that Hill, called
<hi>The vale of the red Horse,</hi> and made a stand some halfe a mile from
the foot of the Hill, and there drew into Battalia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where we saw
their Forces come downe the Hill, and draw likewise into Battell
in the bottome a great broad company: Their Forces appeared
to be much greater then we could possibly have conceived them
to be; by the confession of the prisoners wee have taken, they
that say least, say fourteene thousand, which is the Earle of <hi>
                  <unclear>Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey's</unclear>
               </hi>
Relation, who was their Generall; but others say, eighteen
thousand, and above 4000. horse and Dragoones: The wind was
much for their advantage, and they endeavoured to get it more,
which to prevent, we were inforced to draw out our left Wing
to a great breadth, and by that meanes, before the Battell was
done, gained it wholly from them: In our right Wing were three
Regiments of Horse,<note place="margin">These two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments were led by Sir <hi>Io. Meldrum,</hi> and were of his Brigado.</note> the Lord Generals commanded by Sir <hi>Philip
<unclear>Stapleto</unclear>,</hi> Sir <hi>William Balfore,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Fieldings,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn
Meldrums</hi> Brigado had the Van, Colonel <hi>Essex</hi> was in the middle,
and Colonell <hi>Bullard</hi> with the Lord Generalls Regiment, his
owne, the Lord <hi>Brookes,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Hollis</hi> in the Reare: In the
left Wing were 24. troops of Horse, commanded by Sir <hi>Iames
Ramsey,</hi> their Commissary Generall. In this posture wee stood,
when th'other Army advanced towards us, the strength of their
horse were on their right Wing, opposit to our left Wing; In their
left Wing they had but ten troops, but their Foot which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to us, divided into nine great Bodies, came up all in
front, and after some playing with the Canon on both sides, that
part of it which was on their left, and towards our right
Wing, came on very gallantly to the Charge, and were as gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly
received, and charged by Sir <hi>Philip Stapletons</hi> and Sir
<hi>William Balfore's</hi> Regiments of Horse, assisted with the Lord
<hi>Roberts</hi> and Sir <hi>William Constables</hi> Regiments of Foot, who
did it so home thrice together, that they forced all the Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
of two of their best Regiments to run in and shrowd
themselves within their Pikes, not daring to shoot a shot, and so
stood: When our Reare came up, and then charging all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
especially that part of our Rear which was plac'd upon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96804:3"/>
the right, and so next unto them, which was the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
Regiment, and the Lord <hi>Brooks,</hi> led on by Colonell <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard,</hi>
who commanded that Brigado, forced that stand of
Pikes, and wholly broke those two Regiments, and slew and
took almost every man of them: The Earle of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> his son
the Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> and some other persons of note are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
Sir <hi>Edmund Varney,</hi> who carried the Kings Standard,
was slain by a Gentleman of the Lord Generals Troop of
horse, who did much other good service that day, and the
Standard taken, which was afterwards by the Lord Generall
himself delivered unto his Secretary M. <hi>Chamber<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to send it back the next day unto His Majesty; but the
Secretary after he had carried it long in his hand, suffred it to
be taken away by some of our Troopers, and as yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
learn where it is: The other two Regiments of our Rear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Col. <hi>Hollis,</hi> and Col. <hi>Ballard</hi> charged those which were before
them, and then the whole Body of the Kings Foot, except
two other Regiments ran away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by this time it grew so late
and dark, and to say the truth, our Ammunition at this present
was all spent, that we contented our selves to make good the
field, and gave them leave to retire up the hil in the night: But
before we come to this, we will give you an account of what
passed in the other parts of our Army, before our Reare came
up to charge. Our battell at the very first wholly disbanded
and ran away, without ever striking stroke or so much as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
charged by the Enemy, though Col. <hi>Essex</hi> himselfe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that commanded those Regiments, in chief did as much
as men could doe to stay them; but Col. <hi>Essex</hi> being forsaken
by his whole Brigado, went himself into the Van, where both
by his direction and his owne execution he did most gallant
service, till he received a shot in the thigh, of which he is since
dead: Now for our Rear, thus it was, before it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> towards the out
side of it stood our left wing of Horse, advanced a little for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to the top of a hill, where they stood in a Battalia lined
with commanded Muskettiers, 400 out of Col. <hi>Hollis</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and 200 out of Col. <hi>Ballards;</hi> but upon the first charge
of the Enemy they wheeled about<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> abandoned their Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
and came running down with the enemies horse at their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96804:4"/>
heels, and amongst them pell mell, just upon Col. <hi>Hollis</hi> his
Regiment, and brake through it, though Col. <hi>Hollis</hi> himselfe,
when he saw them come running towards him, went and
planted himselfe just in the way, and did what possibly he
could doe to make them stand, and at last prevailed with 3
Troops to wheele a little about and rally; but the rest of our
horse of that wing, and the Enemies horse with them, brake
through, and ran to Kineton, where most of the Enemy left
pursuing them, and fell to plundring of our waggons, by
which many of us have received very great losse, and by
name, your servants that now write to you: Notwithstanding
their breaking through Col. <hi>Hollis</hi> his Regiment, it was not
dismayed, but together with the other Regiments of that
Brigado marched up the hill, and so made all the haste they
could to come up to fight, &amp; got the wind of the Enemy, and
came on (if we may say it ourselves, but we must do the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
right) most gallantly, and charged the enemy, who were
then in fight with our Van, and the right wing of our Horse;
and as was said before, helpt to defeat the two Regiments
forementioned, and made all the rest run, but two other Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which retired orderly, and at last made a stand, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the assistance of Canon, and a ditch before them, held us
play very handsomely: And by this time it grew so darke, and
our Powder and Bullet so spent, that it was not held fit we
should advance upon them; but there we stood in very good
order, drew up all our Forces both Horse and Foot, and so
stood all the night upon that place where the Enemy before
the fight had drawne into Battalia, till toward Morning that
the enemy was gon, and retired up the hil: And then we retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
also to a warmer place near Kineton, where we had quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the night before, for we were almost starved with cold
in that bitter night, our Army being in extreme want of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals.
And about 9 or 10 of the clock drew out againe into
Battalia, and so stood 3 or 4 hours, till the Enemy was cleane
gone from the hill, and then we drew again into our quarter,
and there have lain this night, and purpose this day, God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
after we have buried our dead, to march to Warwick to
refresh our army, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is exceedingly wearied with so many
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96804:4"/>
nights watching, &amp; so long a fight which held from noon till
dark night: Two particulars must not be omitted, one of
Sir <hi>Wi. Balfore,</hi> who in the beginning of the day broke a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of Foot which had green Colors, beat them to their
Canon, where they threw down their Armes and ran away,
he laid his hand upon the Canon, and called for nails to nail
them up, especially the two biggest which were Demy-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
but finding none, he cut the Ropes belonging to them,
and his Troopers killed the Canoneers: Then he pursued the
flyers halfe a mile upon execution, and after returned to Sir
<hi>Philip Stapleton,</hi> who in the mean time was charging of the
red Regiment, where the Kings Standard was, and had
charged it home to push of Pike with his single Troope; and
they then, together with the helpe of some of the Foot of
our Rear, utterly broke it, as you had it before: The other
particular was of Sir <hi>Phil. Stapleton,</hi> who, when five Troops
of the Enemies horse returned from pursuit of our left wing,
and from plundering some of our waggons and passed by the
out side of our Rear upon the left hand, went and charged
them with his Troop and made them run; but they finding a
gap in the hedge got away, and returned to the rest of their
broken <unclear>Troops</unclear>, where they fallyed and made up a kinde of
Body again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If we had time we could relate unto you many
more observable passages, but what you have here shal serve
you til we meet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This only wil we say, some of both sides did
extreamly well, &amp; others did as ill, and deserve to be hanged
for deserting &amp; betraying as much as lay in them their party,
but God alone is to be praised who fought with us, &amp; for us,
&amp; made it his own work to give the victory unto his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:
We have lost of note<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> onely Colonell <hi>Essex,</hi> and we
