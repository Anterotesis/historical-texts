            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

perhaps was the surprising Revolution which most of our Almanacks both at home and abroad threatned us with in the month of <hi>August.</hi> I remember I happened to be at <hi>Garraway</hi>'s, when a Gentleman came in, and told us the News. Immediately all other discourse ceased, <hi>East-India</hi> Actions, the price of Pepper, and rising of Currants; not a word of our Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> or the Seige of <hi>Belgrade,</hi> the <hi>Turky</hi> Fleet, and the Battle at <hi>Landen</hi> were not mentioned in two hours after. Nay, the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who is now work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracles for us in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> was wholly laid aside. Every body stood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, and it was a considerable time before they could recover themselves out of this astonishment. At last, an Old Gentleman at the upper end of the Table, broke the silence, and made himself and the Company very merry at the Doctor's Expence. Says he, I remember I have somewhere read, that when <hi>Erasmus</hi> heard that <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> of blessed Memory; was married, he should say in a j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sting manner, <hi>That if, according to the Old Tradition, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist was to be got between a Monk and a Nun, the World was now in a fair way to have a Litter of the sort.</hi> Not that I would by any means (continues he) apply this story to the Doctor, for God forbid that we should ever live to see a Brood of Sucking Antichrists come out of the Doctor's Loyns. My meaning is only this, That since the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the Nation has joyned his <hi>Saving</hi> Faculty with a <hi>Damming</hi> Talent (for you are to understand his Lady is a <hi>Muggletonian,</hi> and those people pretend to have the power of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) we may now expect to see a Motley Race of half Saviours and half Dammers. Hold you there, <hi>crys another Gentleman,</hi> you ought to have said half Dammers and half Saviours; for since the Mother's is the surest side, if the Doctor lives to have Children, they'll Damm in all likelihood before they'll Save.</p>
            <p>The Doctor (as I have been acquainted by several of his intimate Friends) had Two Reasons to incline him to marry in his Old Age. The first was his great Grief and Concern to see the Noble Army of Evidences defeated, <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, Dugdale</hi> and <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> sleeping with their Fathers; <hi>viz.</hi> the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that swore against <hi>Sus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nna,</hi> and those that stoned St. <hi>Stephen. Fuller,</hi> who with good management, would have made a clever fellow, buried alive in a Prison, <hi>Etcoetera Young,</hi> his Virtuous Companion, routed, past all hopes of rallying. Others, at the sight of a Pillory, or Whipp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng-post, utter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanc'd, and ashamed of their Profession. So the Doctor finding the whole hopes of the Family of Evidences centring in himself, and that if due care were not taken the <hi>Species</hi> would be intirely lost, resolved, as far as in him lay, to prevent its utter extinction, and to raise up Seed to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Plot himself.</p>
            <p>In the Second place, the Doctor was touched in Conscience for some Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venile Gambols that shall be Nameless. It seems, though he had quitted the other Corruptions of Popery, yet he still fancied <hi>Cardinalism.</hi> Now all the World knows Conscience is a sad terrible thing. What says the Doctor's Friend St. <hi>Austin</hi>? Why, <hi>Conscientia mille Testes,</hi> Conscience is a thousand Witnesses. Is it therefore to be admited if the Doctor, who, make the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56013:3"/>
of him, is but one single Witness, and scarce that, sound himself forced to yeild to a thousand? So then, as I said before, his Conscience perpetually alarming and disturbing him, the Doctor at last, merely for his own ease and quiet, made a Vow to sow his Wild <hi>Oats,</hi> and not to hide the Talent which God had plentifully given him, in an <hi>Italian</hi> Napkin.</p>
            <p>No sooner was this pious Resolution communicated to his Friends, who were mightily pleased at the News, but they looked out sharp to find him a proper Yoke-fellow. It was represented to him that a Maid was by no means for his turn, the D. was Fat and Pursy, a Maidenhead was not to be got with out much drudging for't; and besides 'twas now just the Dog days, and who knew but the D. <hi>Reins</hi> might receive great damage in case of a violent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter. At last an Independent Minister advised him to Mrs. <hi>Margaret W</hi>— of <hi>Breadstreet</hi> (whose former Husband was a Muggletonian, and she continued of the same Perswasion) urging this Argument in her behalf, that in her the D. might have open and free <hi>ingress, egress and regress</hi> as oft as he pleased, that as he might enjoy her without the sweat of, so he might eternally Live with her without the least peril of his Brows, she being no Charmer, and consequently would not equip him with a pair of Horns, which he knew the D. abominated, as being Marks of the Beast, and all together Popish. The D. liked the Proposal, and at the first interview, was so extremely smitten with the Gravity and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of her Person, that he could neither Eat (which was much) nor Drink (which was more) till the business was concluded.</p>
            <p>A Comical passage happen'd at the <hi>Commons,</hi> which I think very well worth the sending to you. The D. going thither for a License, two scurvey Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions were asked him. The first was, whether he would have a License to marry a Boy or a Girl; the second whether he would have a License for Behind or Before. At this the D. lost all Patience, held up his Cane, and thundered out <hi>You Raskal</hi> as thick as Hops, till upon the Proctor's crying <hi>Pecavi,</hi> the Sky cleared up again.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Articles of Marriage were as follows.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Imprimis,</hi> The D. promises <hi>in verbo Sacerdotis,</hi> to keep ne're a Male Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in his House under Sixty, and to hang up the Picture of the Destruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> in his Bed-Chamber <hi>ad reficandam memoriam,</hi> and to teach his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to swear as soon as they can speak,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> The D. promises that he will never offer to attack either in Bed, or Couch, Jointstool, or Table, the Body of the aforesaid Mrs. <hi>Margaret W— à parte post,</hi> but to comfort, refresh, and relieve her <hi>à parte ante,</hi> giving the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid Mrs. <hi>Margaret W</hi>— in case he offends after that manner, full leave to make her self amends before, as she pleases; as also upon a second Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, to burn his <hi>Peacemaker.</hi> However with this <hi>Proviso,</hi> that whenever the aforesaid Mrs. <hi>Margaret W</hi>— happens to be under the Dominion of the Moon, that is to say, whenever it is <hi>Term</hi>-time with the aforesaid Mrs. <hi>Margaret W</hi>— then the abovementioned D. shall have full power, liberty and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
