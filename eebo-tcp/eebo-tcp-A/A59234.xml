         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

most daring. The like may happen in this Subject, that he, who is able to set down the rules and laws which ought to be observed in speech or style, may notwithstanding find himself defective in the application; and so may be said to give that to others, which he hath not himself: But this Treatise indeed may not so properly be termed a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to the Art of Rhetorique, as a Key to unlock and lay open those abstruse difficulties which the Tropes and Figures have hitherto, not only been masked with, but lock'd up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; I mean from such at least, as are altogether unacquainted with the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue, and have not directed their studies to that subject.</p>

            <p>I render the English of each Trope and Figure, &amp; likewise the <hi>English</hi> of the words, from whence they are derived, whether from the Greek or Latin, then a brief definition and lively character and representation of each Trope and Figure, then choyse Latin and <note n="*" place="margin">The English Examples are most of them streams from Sir <hi>Phillip Sidnyes</hi> fountain.</note> English Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples pertinent to each of them, as also a brief and plain explanation of the terms used in Rhetorique, with an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabetical Table for the ready finding each of the Tropes and Figures.</p>

and is like a pleasant garden, bedecked with flowers, or a fruitful field, full of precious treasures, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended it a work worthy the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, to dig into those sacred Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals for the better finding out the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors, Metonymies, Synecdoches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which lie hid there, and have given Scriptural Examples pertinent to each of the Tropes and Figures: For the bare reading of the Scripture, without searching into its heavenly mysteries and meaning, is like the coming into a Treasury, wherein we see many costly things folded up, and some ends appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, but when they be all unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then doth their glory more affect us for the present, yea, and leave in us a deep impression of their excellency: Besides, the ignorance of Rhetorique is one ground (yea, and a great one) of many dangerous Errors this day; as upon perusal of the Scriptural Examples of Synecdoche, Metonymie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will manifestly appear, where you have not only bare instances, but divers Texts cleared and explained; for though the Spirit of the Lord be indeed that Golden

And it is very dangerous to make figures, where the Scripture makes none; or to make the scope and sense bleed with straining it too hard. <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> would sometimes take that literally, which ought to be understood mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and thus mistaking that place, Matth. 19.12.

effingo, assimulo,</hi> to represent, fashion, or feign.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Figure</hi> is an Ornament of elocution, which adornes our speech, or a garnishing of speech when words are used for elegancy in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive signification: as, <q>Latet omnes hora, ut expectetur omnis hora.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If error delight us, if error seduce us, error will ruine us.</p>
            <p>And as in a <hi>Trope,</hi> or the finenesse of words, words are considered asunder by themselves; so in a <hi>Figure,</hi> the apt and pleasant joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of many words is noted: and as of words, some are proper, others changed from their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per signification; so of speeches, some are right and proper as they are; others are figurative, or serving for the representation of another thing.</p>
            <p>The signification of a Figure in Scripture is twofold:</p>
            <p n="1">1. When the Scripture it self propounds an Allegorical signification: as, when 1 Pet. 3.20, 21. <hi>Peter</hi> by <hi>the Arke of Noah,</hi> signifies Baptism: And <hi>Paul</hi> in Heb. 11<hi>s</hi> 29. by <hi>the Red Sea,</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Baptism: And in Joh. 3.14 Christ his Crosse by the <hi>Serpent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When a mans capacity or understanding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces or leads into a figure, and by an apt limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude agrees with some other clear sense or sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of Scripture.</p>

            <p>The garnishing of speech in words, is where the elegancy lies in the placing of one word: as,</p>

                  <p>Where <hi>Philoclea</hi> is expressed by the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a Castle; her natural defence, by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fortification of rivers about a Castle; and the Metaphor continues in the attempting her by force or craft, expressed by battering or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining.</p>
                  <p>But when she had once his Ensign in her minde: then followed whole squadrons of lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, that so it might be with a main battle of mislikings and repinings aginst their creation.</p>

                  <p>Sometimes an Allegory is mixt with some words retaining their proper and genuine signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, whereof this may be an Example:</p>
                  <p>Why covetest thou the fruit, and considerest not the height of the tree whereon it growes? thou dost not forethink of the difficulty in clim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, nor danger in reaching, whereby it comes to passe, that while thou endeavourest to climb to the top, thou fallest with the bough which thou embracest.</p>
                  <p>This Allegory describes, though somewhat obscurely, yet very aptly the danger, vanity, and common reward of ambition: And the words which retain their proper signification are these, covetest, considerest, and forethink; which words do make it a mixt Allegory.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>A natural Allegory is such as is expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the Scriptures themselves; and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is the mystical sense of the Scripture: as,</p>
                  <p>Gal. 4.25. For this <hi>Agar</hi> is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answeteth to Jerusalem which now is, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apostles meaning here is, that in a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical sense, <hi>Agar</hi> hath some proportion unto Jerusalem, that is unto the Jewes, whose Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis or chief City Jerusalem was: for, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> the bond-woman obtained a place in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> house, and was at length cast forth thence; so the Jews were in the Apostles time under the servitude of the Law, and for that they would be justified by the works of the Law, were ejected the house of God.</p>
                  <p>Exod. 34.29. The face of <hi>Moses</hi> shined, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This contains an Allegorical sense which the Apostle explains in 2 Cor. 3.7., 13, 14. But if the ministration of death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was glorious, so that the Israelites could not stedfastly behold the face of <hi>Moses</hi> for the glory of his countenance,<note place="margin">The Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the odl Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>

                  <p>The like Allegory you may find if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Exod. 12.15, 17. with 1 Cor. 5.7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. An Allegory inferr'd, is such as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self shewes not, nor makes manifest, but is brought in by interpreters.</p>

                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:51744:44"/>Allegories of this kind are like unto pictures; but their literal expositions like to stone-wals; the house hath its strength from the stone-wals, the pictures afford not the least strength either to the house or wals.</p>
                  <p>This Allegory is either offered, or inforced and wrested:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That inferr'd Allegory from Scripture which is offered, hath a probable ground and foundation in the literal sense, and a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable agreeablenesse of things, and is likewise agreeable to the Analogie of faith: as,</p>
                  <p>Gen. 6.14. The description there of the Arke of <hi>Noah</hi> doth allegorically represent Gods spiritual house or Church, which in 1 Pet. 2.5. is said to be built up of living stones; and also denotes the Lords miraculous preservation of that Church of his, so that neither the waves, or strange and pernicious doctrines, or tentations or persecutions can break in upon or drown it.</p>
                  <p>Gen. 8.11. The Olive leaf represents the Gospel; for in Luk. 10.34 it is evident that oil signifies mercy and peace.</p>
                  <p>Luk. 15. The prodigal, when absent from his f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So in the whole book of Canticles, the sweet conference between Christ and his Church, is set down in the words and expressions proper to husband and wife.</p>
                  <p>Thus old age is most elegantly decipher'd in Eccles. 12.5, 6.</p>

                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:51744:44"/>2. An Allegory inforc'd and wrested, is such as is lest destitute of a probable ground or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the literal sense; either it differs too much from the thing, from which it is taken, or it is agreeable to another and thwart object; or otherwise it is too far remote from the Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of the Scriptures: as, such are,</p>
                  <p>Mat. 13, 8. And other seeds fell into good ground and brought forth fruit, some an hundred fold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See Psal. 110.1. Mat. 15.11.</p>

                  <p>Also by denying the Superlative it takes the Positive degree thus:</p>
                  <p>He is not the wisest man in the world, or he is none of the wisest, (<hi>i e.</hi>) he is not wise at all.</p>

                  <p>Here, if he should have said, I was first, or one of the foremost in the field, although he had spoken never so truly, it would have savou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of arrogancy and boasting.</p>

                  <p>Thus when the Scripture would strongly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, it doth it oftentimes by denying the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: as,</p>
                  <p>Isai. 38.1. Thou shalt die, and not live, (<hi>i.e.</hi>) thou shalt certainly die.</p>
                  <p>The like in Ezek. 18.21. Deut. 28, 33. Joh. 1.20. Isa. 39.4. Jer. 42.4. 1 Joh. 1.5.</p>
                  <p>Job. 31.17. <hi>Job</hi> saith that he hath not eaten his meat alone, and that he hath not seen any man perish for want of cloathing, or any poor for lack of covering.</p>

                  <p>It is very familiar with the Hebrewes, by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming and denying to expresse the same thing for stronger confirmation of 10: as,</p>

what might be objected against him, and hurt him as to what he is about to deliver, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it, before it be spoken; or when we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any objection, by framing an answer; or when we bring an objection and yield an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer thereunto:</p>
               <p>This figure hath <hi>Hypophora</hi> and <hi>Anthypophora</hi> necessarily relerting unto it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hypophora,</hi> signifies an Objection; it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds an objection, and is when the speaker makes answer unto own demand; As,</p>
               <p>Isa. 37.23. Whom hast thou reproached, and blasphemed? And against whom hast thou exalted thy voyce, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the holy one of Israel.</p>
               <p>Rom. 6.1, 2. Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anthypophora</hi> signifies a contrary illation or inferenee, and is when an objection is refuted or disproved by the opposition of a contrary sentence: as,</p>
               <p>Matth. 21.23, 24, 25. The chief Priests and the Elders of the people came unto Christ, as he was teaching and said, By what authority dost thou these things? And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do those things: The Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of <hi>John,</hi> whence was it? from heaven, or men? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And they reasoned with themselvs, saying, If we shall say from heaven, he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him? but if we shall say of men, we fear the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <head>Scriptural Examples.</head>
                  <p>There are in Scripture nine kinds of questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (<hi>inter alia</hi>).</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sometimes a question is asked with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire only to receive an answer: as, The Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of <hi>Jonas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Jonas 1.8. Tell us (say they) for whose cause is this evill come upon us? what is thine occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation? and whence comest thou? Such a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion you may finde the wise men made touching Christ, in Matth. 2.2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Interrogations in Scripture are sometimes emphatical and strong affirmations: as,</p>
                  <p>Gen. 4.7. If thou doe well, shalt thou not be accepted? (<hi>i. e.</hi>) thou a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d thy Sacrifice shall both certainly be accepted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Josh. 1.9. Have not I commanded thee? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have without all question assuredly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>See more examples in Gen. 13.9.37.13. 2 Sam. 13.28. 2 King. 6.32. Joh. 4.35. Mar. 12.24. Jer. 23.23, 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 King. 12.19.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Interrogations also are sometimes strong and vehement negations: as,</p>
                  <p>Psal. 19.12. Who can understand his errors? <hi>(i. e.</hi>) no man can understand the depth of them.</p>
                  <p>Gen. 18.14. Is any thing too hard for God?</p>
                  <p>Job 8.3, 11. Doth God prevert judgement? or doth the Almighty pervert justice? Can the rush grow up without mire? Can the flag grow without water? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:51744:77"/>See Matth. 12.26. Rom. 3.3, 10, 14, 15. &amp; 8.35.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Interrogations sometimes diminish and abate the sense: as,</p>
                  <p>Zech. 4.7. Who art thou, O great Mountain? before <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> thou shalt be a plain, <hi>&amp;c. (i. e</hi>) Thou lookest very big and great, but who art thou? I will tell thee, oh proud oppressor of my people, though in thy own conceit thou art a Mountain immoveable, yet in my peoples eyes thou art but a Mole-hill, and shall shortly be made a nothing, even as a plain before them.</p>
                  <p>Thus in 2 Sam. 7.18. <hi>David</hi> when he would abase himself, cryes out; Who am I, O Lord God? and what is my house that thou hast brought me hitherto?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Interrogations sometimes raise and heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the sense by way of admiration: as,</p>
                  <p>Psal. 8.9. O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the world?</p>
                  <p>Exod. 15.11. Who is a God like unto thee? <hi>&amp;c. (i. e.</hi>) Let all the world (if they can) shew such a God as thou art.</p>
                  <p>See Mark 7.18. Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? &amp;c. The question here puts the brightest glory upon God in pardoning sin; There is no sin-par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning God, but our God only.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Interrogations are sometimes expostulato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and complain: as,</p>
                  <p>Job 3.11, 12. Why dyed I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:51744:78"/>Psal. 22.1. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Jer. 12.1. Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? so in Isa. 1.21. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. You find in the Scripture doubting que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions: as,</p>
                  <p>Psal. 77.7, 8. Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more? Is his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy clean gone for ever? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. You may also finde teaching questions: as,</p>
                  <p>Isa. 60.8. Who are these that flie as a clowd, and as the Doves to their windows? This tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches us the multitude of those that shall (when the Angels shall be sent out of the Temple to preach the everlasting Gospel) flock in unto Christ.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. You may also finde learning questions: as,</p>
                  <p>Acts 2.37. Men and Brethren, what shall we doe to be saved? &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Thus in Matth. 22. in the beginning of the Chapter, after the relation of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Kings sons marriage, and of the man, who (for that he had nor on a wedding garment) was cast into outer darkness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you finde this acclamation elegantly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the end of that discourse: as,</p>

                  <p>So the Psalmograph having in the former part of the 2. Psalm spoken of the terrors of Gods indignation when his wrath is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led against his Adversaries, we find this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,</p>

                  <p>The God of all grace, out of the fountain of his rich mercy oft uses this manner of speaking, thereby to condescend to the weaknesse of our capacities, clear up things to our understandings, and beat them as it were into our dull apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: as,</p>
                  <p>Deut. 13.4. Ye shall walk after the Lord and fear him, and keep his commandments, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his voyce, and you shall serve him, and cleave unto him.</p>

               <p>A Metaphor whereby that which properly is agreeable to the creatures, and especially to man, is by some similitude transferr'd unto the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and heavenly things.</p>
               <p>This is very frequent in Scriptures, when it speaks of God after the manner of men, and by bodily things sets forth the divine excellencies
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51744:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the spiritual and eternal being.</p>
               <p>This Metaphorical form of speech is also by others called <hi>Syncatabasis, condescensio,</hi> conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension, for that in holy writ the Lord doth as it were descend unto us, and under humane things resembles and expresses heavenly myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries unto our capacities.</p>
               <p>Thus the Lord is said to have a face in Psal. 116.11.17.15. and eyes, in Psal. 11.4. to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his omnisciencie; bowe's in Isa. 63.15; and a bosome in Psal. 74.11. to denote unto us his infinite mercy and most ardent love.</p>
               <p>Thus in Psal. 48.14. he is said to be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples guide even unto death; and in Psal. 62, 7. the rock of their strength and their refuge; in Psal. 18.2. their buckler and the horn of their salvation; Thus in Psal. 17.8. he is said to have wings, to shew his care and protection of his people.</p>
               <p>These and such like are the condescensional characters of comfort, whereby we may easily read and plainly understand the goodnesse and rich mercy of the incomprehensible Jehovah.</p>
               <p>Thus the Lord also in respect of his adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries is by this Metaphor pourtrayed with letters of a contrary signification; as, a Giant to wound, a Judge to condemn, and a fire to consume.</p>
