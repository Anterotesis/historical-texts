         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Children and Young People
who were Hearers of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
SERMONS.</head>
            <p>THE Design of these <hi>Sermons</hi> was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
and improve the state of your
Souls. The Blessing of God having made
them successful to several of you, enclined
me to publish them at your importunity; thô I do
oft refuse a Compliance with many judicious Friends,
in desires of the same kind, even when the Subjects
are more perswading.</p>
            <p>Having overcome the Discouragement which I
suggested to my self, from the plainness of these
Discourses, I dare not make an Apology for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monness
of the Stile or Matter. It had been a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation
of an Ordinance,</hi> when desired to preach
to Youth, to propose any Subject below what tends to
their Salvation, from that Sin and Wrath they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
under. It had been <hi>folly</hi> to treat of such a
Subject for Edification before Children and Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices,
in words unapt to inform or perswade them.
I thank God I could rather bear the dislike of a few
less serious wits, than neglect the eternal Concerns
of so many less intelligent Hearers. On the same
account, I am now afraid to raise the Style, or omit
<pb facs="tcp:48747:3"/>
the very repeated Appeals and Pleadings with Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
being resolved to approve my self to the weakest
Reader, and leave the judicious to what is more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their improvement.</p>
            <p>My Prayer and Hopes be, That God will accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
this Book with powerful effects on your Souls,
and not leave you to that obstinacy, as will render it
a farther aggravation of your sin and punishment;
you cannot pretend that God never informed you of
your Disease, nor directed you to a Cure: You dare
not, after reading this Book, say, My Danger was
concealed from me, and Rules for my Safety were
not prescribed. God will severely witness, that he
condescended to argue matters with thy Soul; he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
thee from the Sins that will condemn thee at
last, however thou now flatterest thy self. He useth
many Arguments to encline thee to Duties which
his very Gospel cannot dispence with the want of, in
any person whom he will save.</p>
            <p>Let me then acquaint thee, oh young Man! that
God addresseth himself to thee, as by Name. Thou
by nature art brutish and devilish, and as long as
thou followest the imaginations of thy vain mind, thy
case becomes more desperate, thy Lusts by indulgeuce
grow more violent, and Conscience still less concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to vindicate the Affronts thou offerest to Gods Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
or to represent the injury thou dost to thy own
Soul; yet be assured, whether thou mindest it or not,
there is a God, whose right it is to govern thee, and will
be sure to judge thee: Thou art born his Subject,
thô unwilling to obey, and forward to rebell against
him; thou hast an immortal Soul, how little soever
<pb facs="tcp:48747:3"/>
thou providest for its future State; yea, how much
soever thou actest to expose it to endless misery,
and this for a short and fading Pleasure. Thou
art naturally depraved, and thereby under that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
which was pass'd by the Law of Innocency
against man, in the least sinful.</p>
            <p>Oh, then do not fancy that Baptism did regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
thee whiles thou findest the want of every Grace,
and carnal Inclinations are thy governing Law. Do
not conceit that Baptism delivered thee from thy
cursed State, when thy Vnbelief and Enmity against
holiness, do both express it, and further expose
thee to it. It's true, there is a way of Salvation
for lost man published in the Gospel; but that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
none who continues to reject Christ, and refuse
the terms of Peace. Thou art the dedicated Child
of believing Parents, but their Faith cannot save
thee now that thou art capable of consenting to the
Covenant, and refusest it; yea, thy early Dedication
adds Perjury and Falshood to thy Profaneness. Plead
not thy Christian Name, whiles thou art a Reproach
to it. Boast not of religious helps, when they have
not that good effect on thee, as the light of Nature
hath on meer Pagans; which may convince us, that
where the Gospel fails to convert its Hearers,
Satan oft governs more powerfully, than if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
had never been preached to them. We live in
an Age of wonders, among which it is not the least
strange or awful, that professed Christians are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
than Heathens, and most of our baptized Youths
scorn the plainest Rules of Christianity. Ah, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Age! wherein Gospel-light cannot convince of
<pb facs="tcp:48747:4"/>
that wickedness which even Nature condemns!
what Conceptions have they of God, who think he
can approve of such Enormities as they commit, or
be satisfied with those heartless and trifling Regards
to which they confine all the Homage which they
afford him?</p>
            <p>Surely <hi>England's</hi> Calamities are like to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
when this jealous God ariseth to force men to
juster Thoughts both of his Nature and his Laws.</p>
            <p>I must allow that this Treatise is intended
to convince thee of the great Evil of such things
as most esteem indifferent, and practise as allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
yea, so far doth their blindness prevail, that
Sobriety (much more Godliness) is ridicul'd as
Folly. But know that the feeling of endless Torments
will soon convince such as dare mock at Divine
Revelations. The Perfections that render God able
to endure their Affronts now, will oblige him to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
his Government and Honour then. Poor
Wretches that would not be ruled by means suited
to their Natures, as rational, shall without their
Consent undergo the inflicted Evils, which, whiles
only threatned, did not move them. Therefore,
young Man, be not affrighted from true Wisdom by
the Clamours of the worst of Fools, whatever Wit
they pretend to. Vndo not thy self for the sake of
a Crowd, for it's better be religious with the lesser
number now, than be damned hereafter with the
multitude: Sure thou must be an Atheist, and
wholly disbelieve unseen things, if the Contempt or
Perswasions of enslaved Factors for the Devil can
encline thee to chuse Hell, by resolving the Course
that infallibly tends to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48747:4"/>
I must acquaint you, That in the last Sermon I
add no Particular to the Notes one of your selves
took from me when I preached, and supplyed me
since with, to help the defect of my own Papers; yet
I have added many of the Directions for avoiding
the eight particular sins I disswaded you from in
my first Sermon. I have also thought fit to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
<hi>a short Catechism</hi> in the end, wherein you
may learn the Essentials of Practical Religion in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
Terms, if you think fit to learn it, consult
the Proofs.</p>
            <p>The good Lord prosper all to you. Could I but see
young ones generally enclined to serious Religion, I
would hope that God hath a mercy in reserve for
<hi>England,</hi> and the Vengeance that hangs over it
because of the last thirty years too successful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
to debauch the Nation, in order to Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and Popery, might be diverted, or at least
confined to such as are too far engaged, or obstinate
to admit a Reformation.</p>
            <p>That every Child and Youth who shall read this
Book, may (as many of you already do) thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to my Hopes and Share in the Benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
shall be the Prayer of</p>

            <head>Childhood and Youth are Vanity.</head>
            <p>THis present Meeting is for the spiritual
advantage of you Children and young
People: Your good we Ministers must
intend, and its your Interest and Duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
and improve these helps, as well as el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Persons, for your Souls are are as Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
as the Aged; God hath a right to govern
you, being you are his Creatures. He hath given
you a Rule of Life, he observeth your Hearts
and Carriage with concern. Young Ones shall
be arraigned at Gods Tribunal, and judged by
the Rule contained in his Word, according to
what they have been and done. Heaven and
Hell are before you, one of them will be the
eternal dwelling of the youngest in this Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;
and considering, that most of Mankind
dye when young, Heaven and Hell are fuller
of Young People, than of such as arrived to
a greater Age.</p>
            <p>Do such Considerations affect you? ought
they not to make me serious, and importunate
with your Souls? And with <hi>yours</hi> especially,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48747:7"/>
because Youth is under great indispositions to
all that is serious and saving.</p>
            <p>Oh let us look earnestly for a blessing to
him, who is the <hi>God of the Spirits of all Flesh,</hi>
Numb. 16. 23. and therefore is able to impress
and manage your Spirits tho' unruly and vain.</p>
            <p>The Author of this Book is <hi>Solomon;</hi> will
you regard what a Great Man saith? He was
King of <hi>Israel</hi> in its most prosperous State:
Are a wise Mans dictates to be heeded? He
was the wisest of meer Men. But above that,
this Book was the result of great Experience;
he speaks his feeling as well as his Judgment;
yea, he records these things as a Penitent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
great offences, and therefore must repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
things according to their truth and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
especially since he was inspired by the
Infallible Spirit in what he here delivers.</p>
            <p>I shall not look further than the <hi>11th.</hi> verse,
to lead you to my Text.</p>
            <p>1. There he doth by a sharp Sarcasm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the sensual delights of Young People, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
O Young Man,</hi> &amp;c. its such a saying as
Christs to his Disciples, <hi>Sleep on and take your
rest,</hi> Mar. 14. 41. It's not said by way of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
but he exposeth the Sensualist by
disdain, which may affect some People more
than a direct Reproof; and God for our good
condescends to try all ways. Surely you that
think sensual pleasure the greatest happiness
you are capable of, will suspect that it is not
what it appears to your foolish minds, whon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48747:7"/>
God by the Wisest Man doth thus Ironically
brand it: he loads you with scorn, while you
fondly please your selves with these poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
as your only Paradice. God keep me
from that as my Portion, which God accounts
my reproach.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But may not a Young Man rejoyce?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes no doubt, thou oughtest to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
thy self in the Lord,</hi> Psal. 37. 4. yea, thou
mayst delight moderately and holily in Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of sence; but that's not the rejoycing
here exposed. The following words explain
the nature of this forbidden joy, it's that evil
pleasure which thou takest in <hi>walking in the
wayes of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes.</hi>
q. d. Oh vile Creature! how base art thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
that confinest thy pleasures to, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvedly
wallowest in the delights that come
by following the vain imaginations of thy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
heart, and meer gratifying thy sences.
What a bruit art thou, that sportest thy self
in a disregard of God and unseen things, and
valuest the time of Youth only as it fits thee
to execute what is sinful, and relish what is
sensual! Is this rejoycing becoming thee as a
reasonable Creature, made for and suited to
things of so far a higher nature? Is thy corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
to the Objects of Faith quite gone?
art thou so sunk and buried in flesh? Is there
no spiritual light or love to govern thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
and pleasures? If this be the merry
Young Man, what an object of contempt is he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48747:8"/>
in all his mirth? even in his jollity he is to be
scorned, as well as pityed.</p>
            <p>2. He allarms this brutish Sensualist with a
prospect of Judgment. God addresseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to thee as one stupidly ignorant, <hi>but know
thou:</hi> it's what thou art little acquainted with,
or thoughtful about; <hi>for all these things he will
bring thee into judgment,</hi> a sore thorn in thy gay
Cloaths; a great cooler to thy lusts, meer
gall in thy Cups, and a sad disturbance to thy
airy conceits: <hi>God will bring thee into judgment
for all these things.</hi> Thô thou despise his Laws,
thou shalt not escape his Sentence: he will not
leave it to thee, whether thou shalt be misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
though he referr'd it to thy choice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou wouldst be serious: hee'l compell
thee to feel his wrath, though he would not
force thee to refrain thy voluptuousness. Yea,
Oh thou that sportest thy self in thy brutish
delights! thou shalt account for all, thou
shalt suffer for each. Thy punishment shall be
proportioned to thy sins, and to thy pleasures
thou didst take in sinning, and dost thou never
consider how great that's like to be?</p>
            <p>3. He then annexeth a serious Caution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
two evils, to which Young Persons are
obnoxious, <hi>v.</hi> 10. Therefore <hi>remove sorrow from
thy heart;</hi> that is anger, as the word may be
rendred, or all those heart lusts which will
end in sorrow of heart. Thou art afraid of
seriousness, thou seemest to prevent sorrow by
thy carnal mirth: but alas, thou art making
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48747:8"/>
way for the deepest groans by thy seeming
cure; thou bringest on sorrow by a pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
driving it away. But Young Man, God
seeing thou takest a wrong course, condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends
to warn thee against the anguish which
thou preparest by thy vicious inclination.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>And put away evil from thy flesh;</hi> that is,
fleshly pollutions, to which Youth is prone,
or the bodily punishments which vile courses
expose to: If you take the first sence, then, as
in forbidding heart lusts, he stops a course of
sin at the Spring-head, without which all the
attempts for Reformation will be too feeble;
so in forbidding fleshly pollutions, he would
restrain the acting of sin: <hi>q. d.</hi> Thô Lust is
conceived in the Heart, yet let it not break
forth in thy practice: for abstinence from
wicked acts will conduce to change thy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and abate thy guilt. If you take the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sence, then he argues from that misery,
which brutish Youth is most likely to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by, <hi>q. d.</hi> That Body which thou so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgest,
that flesh whereof thou art so tender,
is like to feel the woful effects of thy folly:
Therefore as thou lovest thy very flesh, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
not the flames which are to devour it in
Hell; bring not down those Judgments, which
may torment thy Body on this side the Grave.</p>
            <p>The wise Man introduces these advices by
a Motive referring to <hi>v. 9. Therefore,</hi> &amp;c. as
if he had said, because <hi>God will bring thee to
judgment,</hi> avoid these sins, for which thou
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48747:9"/>
shalt certainly be arraigned, and prevent the
miseries which the sentence will include, and
which the Judge must execute according to
the sanction of that Law whereby thou shalt
be judged. Then, then, O Young Man! thou
shalt know by the punishment felt, that thy
Lawgivers threatnings were not vain, though
during temptations they appeared so.</p>
            <p>My Text is a further Motive, and as such
is here inserted: <hi>For Childhood and Youth are
Vanity,</hi> q. d. To these sins your young years
are prone, they have room in your temper,
and without great care and labour cannot be
removed, or put away; therefore be intent
and vigorous <hi>to put away evil from your flesh, to
remove sorrow from thy heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus described the Coherence of the
words, I shall lay them down for a Doctrine,
as they be in my Text.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>Childhood and Youth are Vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall explain this Doctrine, and insist on
that sence of the words, which will most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the advantage of Young Persons.</p>
            <p>(1.) Childhood and Youth may be taken
for that time of Humane Life, which is short
of Manhood.</p>
            <p>If you take it thus, then the whole clause
may be thus expressed: Though you are very
apt to boast of these years, as most conducive
to happiness, though now your Spirits are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous,
your Bodies healthy and strong, your
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48747:9"/>
Sences quick, the Cares and Maladies of Old-Age
are far from you; yet all this will not make
you happy. This time of Youth it self is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
it's insufficient to make thee a Blessed
Creature; yea, though thou didst enjoy all
sensible things that can minister to its satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
it is but vanity; a poor thing, a short
and empty matter, which leaves its admirers
deceived, yea, undone, if they have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
provision. A serious Old Man disdains
those years, and would not live them over
again; yea, few live long that wish not much
of that time expunged out of their life, and
remember it with a blush.</p>
            <p>(2.) Childhood and Youth note Persons of
those Years or age, <hi>viz.</hi> Children and Young
People.</p>
            <p>I shall consider these words in this sence,
and of such of you the Spirit of God proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vanity, as your proper Epithite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> What is meant by Vanity, as it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates
of these Young People?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Vanity is either natural or moral, and
then it's the same as to say,</p>
            <p>1. Young People are frail and mortal. <hi>All
flesh is grass, and the goodliness thereof as the flower
of the Field,</hi> Isa. 40. 6. The robust Youth hath his
breath in his Nostrils; by the Course of Nature
he may live longer than Old men, yet by the
Frailty of Nature he may die before the oldest
man. Thou reckonest upon long Life, but thou
mayest dye tomorrow: Oh young man! thou
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48747:10"/>
hast the seeds of Death in thee, thou canst
not resist any Messenger of Death; <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 17.
the Sentence lies against thee, and sin the cause
of Death cleaves to thy early Age, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10.
What variety of accidents art thou subject to
every moment? It's by Gods power you Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are alive till now, as well as the Man of
eighty: Oh young Folk! that think of many
years, before Death and you can meet; how
many younger than you are already rotten in
their graves? there may be many Children in
this place, whose death your Fathers, yea,
Grandfathers may live to mourn for: it's a brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
house <hi>your</hi> very Souls inhabit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exh.</hi> I cannot omit this Exhortation. Do
and forbear all you ought to do and forbear in
order to Eternity, as Persons within a step of
Death. I hope the youngest here are assured, that
<hi>there is no working in the grave,</hi> Eccl. 9. 10. What
is to be done for Eternity must be done while
you live; the state of trial lasts no longer than
Life: whatever is beyond the Grave, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
reward or punishment.</p>
            <p>Wilt thou lay to Heart these things? 1. I
have much to do for Eternity. 2. Work for
Eternity is hard to do. 3. This work as hard
as it is must be done, or I perish for ever.
4. How short a while may I, as young as I am,
have to do all this hard work in, which is the
point I am on: Young Man, if Death overtake
thee, thou canst not put it off till thou set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the work thou hast neglected: all the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48747:10"/>
cryes in the Word will avail nothing. Bethink
thee then, if <hi>Ahijah</hi> had not been good betimes,
he must have been eternally undone; so it may
be thy Case, O Child of ten years old! if thou
dost not get Grace before thou art a Year older,
or it may be a Month or Week older, thou must
dye graceless. Doth not the Word tell thee of
some <hi>who dye in youth, and their life is among the
unclean,</hi> Job 6. 14.: Shall that be thy Case? canst
thou bear it? be perswaded now to fix thy
thoughts on such things as these: Shall I Lye
or Swear now, who may be dead within a
Month? Dare I prophane this Sabbath, who
may be dead within a Week? yea, my next
sin may be the last act of my Life. How can
I live without Christ a day longer, when I may
dye to Night? shall I delay to know, and love,
and fear my God, who must do it soon or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver?
I am sure if I do not fear God before
I dye, Hell will be my place; and I am not
sure of a Week to attain this Fear of God.
Did the youngest of you know your frailty,
you would tremble at delays, you would not
dare to sin, you would blush at your sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
in any good Work. Oh then hear
this Sermon as one that may never hear ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!
Pray the next time as one that may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Pray again. When thou art next tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ask thy self, Would I yield to this if I
were to dye to morrow? Will you believe
this, and walk as them that believe it? even
Youth is too uncertain for any wise one to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48747:11"/>
venture to sin, or neglect his Salvation, as if
sure of time to repent, and repair his neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects.</p>
            <p>2. Vanity is taken in a moral sense, <hi>viz.</hi>
as it regards the minds and manners; thus
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 17. the Spirit of God warns us against
<hi>walking in the Vanity of the Mind.</hi> Vanity is
oft put for all sins, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 15. several sins
are expresly called Vanity; and this Name is
applyed, partly with respect to the Nature
of some sins, but chiefly from the tendency and
consequence of every sinful course. Every
way of sin is vain; and sin deserves the Name
of Vanity from this consideration, that it is
committed to no valuable purpose; yea, it
ends in what is destructive, and far worse
than meerly unprofitable.</p>
            <p>In this sense I shall improve the Text, and
it includes these things:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Young people are prone to many sins
that are notoriously vain.</item>
               <item>2. Young People are apt to live to very
low and unprofitable purposes, which is Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</item>
               <item>3. Young People are apt to live to evil and
destructive purposes, which is the heighth of
Vanity.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Before I enter on these things, let me ask
you young Folk, Is not this a true Charge?
and is it not as awful a description of your
State as true?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:48747:11"/>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But how comes this to be laid so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally,
that all young People are thus
vain?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Because the generality of young
People are vain: For one that is sober, how
many are wild? for one that is pious, there
be many prophane. A religious Child is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a wonder. Godliness in youthful years
is very rare: The body of your ordinary young
People is sottish; the generality of witty
Youths are atheistical and irreligious. When
the Disease is so common, the charge is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
as against the whole.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. All young Persons are inclin'd to
be vain: Vanity is the Temptation of that
Age; your Constitution and want of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
do especially expose you to this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
though Grace may deliver some of you
from the power of Vanity yet it hath not
cleansed you from all disposition to Vanity;
it hangs about you, and liveth, though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained:
Your stumbles will be at this stone,
and your Faults will be under this head of
youthful Vanity.</p>
            <p>Young People! you see why the Charge is
so common: Will you then apply what I shall
say to your selves? When I describe the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
say, This is my Disease: When I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Remedy, speak to thy Soul, This is
proper for my Case, this is necessary to my
Condition. Thou Child, say, I am a Child,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48747:12"/>
and therefore apt to be vain. Thou young
Man! say, I am a young Man, and therefore
I am apt to be vain. I must deny my Age,
or own this Charge. Nay further, reason
awfully with your selves, <hi>Most</hi> young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are under the power of Vanity: The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Youths are a hundred to one that's pious.
Oh my Soul what is my Condition! is not
there more danger that I am one of those
hundred wicked ones, than that I am that <hi>One</hi>
pious young one.</p>
            <p>I shall now return to consider the three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
under which I included the Moral
Vanity of young People.</p>
            <p>1. Young People are prone to many sins
that are notoriously Vain.</p>
            <p>There be some particular sins that in their
Nature argue more Vanity than other sins;
they inferr a very vain mind in the Persons
committing them. Young ones have many
of these sins, and Lusts strongly prompting
thereto.</p>
            <p>I shall reduce your sins to eight particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
and give you some Directions under
each, to help you against that particular sin:
But remember each of these are sins; every
sin defileth thy Soul, and bindeth thee to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
the Punishment threatned, if it be not
repented of and mortified: Nor canst thou
hope that these sins will be put away, unless
thou follow the Methods which God hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
for that end: He will not Convert thee
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48747:12"/>
as a Bruit that regards nothing, thô he must
consider thy weakness as a Sinner, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
exert his Power by the Means thou at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendest.</p>
            <p>1. Young People are subject to Folly.</p>
            <p>The Spirit brands our tender years with
this Crime: <hi>Prov. 22. 15. Folly is bound up in
the Heart of a Child:</hi> Is this limited to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?
No, <hi>A young Man void of understanding</hi>
is too often seen, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 7. This fault is not
a want of that Wisdom which is unexpected
from your Age: But it is such Folly as in your
Years might have been healed; and it's made
up of blindness and mistakes against that light
which God hath afforded you.</p>
            <p>God hath given you reason to govern your
selves by, you are under the Means of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
whereby you may know your true end,
and the proper means to that end: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
most young Persons are Fools. Dost not
thou place thy Interest in things which are
vain and destructive? Dost not thou think
Jollity thy only Heaven, and the pleasing thy
Lusts the only real Paradice? What is enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God, or glorifying God to thee? these
are things thou art unacquainted with, and
unconcerned for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Perhaps thou wilt say, I desire to be
saved, and I do something towards it, how
then do I mistake my end or means.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48747:13"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. I fear thou dost not know what it is
to be saved: Salvation with thee is only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
kept out of Hell, as a place of Torment,
when thou hast sin'd thy fill; but there is little
more to commend Heaven to thee. If there be
not vain sports, Revelling, and the like carnal
Enjoyments; thou canst not tell how Heaven
should be a happy State, thô better than Hell:
But is not this the grossest Folly? What, to
think that Salvation, which contains no Vision
of God, no perfect Holiness of Heart, no full
Conformity to Christ, no ravishing sense or
Communications of the Divine Love, no hand
in God's Praises? Foolish Youth! there's no
Heaven but what principally includes these;
that is not Salvation which wants any of these.
Let me ask thee, art not thou foolish, if thou
judgest Salvation to be what it is not? art
thou not foolish to think it to be another thing
than God describeth it to be? art thou not a
Fool, that fanciest that cannot be a happy
State, unless it wants what all good Men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to be Happiness? and unless it includes
such wicked and bruitish things as Heaven must
keep and cleanse us from? Oh poor Creature!
thus foolish do thy Notions of eternal Life dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
thee to be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. Thy Folly appeareth, in that thou
fanciest thou canst be saved in another way,
than that which leads to it. To convince
thee of this, consider that,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:48747:13"/>
1. Christ is the principal <hi>Way</hi> to Life, <hi>Ioh.
14.</hi> 8. He as a Priest by offering up himself,
merited Life for such as repent, believe, and
obey him: He as a Prophet teacheth Men the
Author, Means, and Nature of the Terms of
Life: He as King applies his Purchase by the
Spirit, subdues Impediments, fits the Soul for,
and judicially admits it into Glory. Now
Child! dost thou hope to live for ever, and
neglect Christ? is it not Folly to expect Life
and despise a Saviour, yea, trample his Blood
under thy Feet? is it not Folly to hope to be
saved by Christ, and yet believe the Devil ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than him, and prefer the Dominion of
others before his Government?</p>
            <p>2. Faith, Repentance and Holiness, are a way
to Heaven, subordinate to Christ: I say, <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate</hi>
to Christ, for they could not save thee
but for a Christ; Sinners had never obtained
them, but by a Christ; and they tend to save
as they refer to Christ, whose atonement is
the only purchasing Price.</p>
            <p>But yet they are a way to Life: No Man
shall ever get to Heaven without them. Christ
hath resolved without Faith, no Man shall have
Pardon by his Merits, and therefore all the
savingly enlightned do <hi>believe, that they may
be justified,</hi> Gal. 2. 16.</p>
            <p>He appoints us to repent, that our sins may
be blotted out, <hi>when the times of refreshing shall
come,</hi> Act. 3. 19. and limits the number of the
saved <hi>to</hi> such <hi>as obey him,</hi> Heb. 5. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:48747:14"/>
Now young Man, is it not Folly in thee to
expect Heaven, when thou hast nothing which
Christ hath instituted as a means of that Glory?
Doth he as our Law-giver declare that he will
and must suspend thy Salvation 'till thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
and wilt thou madly say, he will save
me, though I do not believe? dost thou know
what he'll do better than himself?</p>
            <p>Yea, your Folly is greater, in that Christ
hath not only suspended Life on these Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but he hath expresly declared, that they
shall for ever perish, that do not in these things
submit to him; and yet thou art confident.</p>
            <p>What greater Folly than for an unholy one
to look for Glory, when God saith, <hi>Without
Holiness no Man shall see the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12. 14.
and <hi>All the wicked shall be turned into Hell,</hi> Psal.
9. 17. is it not Folly to remain impenitent,
and yet be in hopes of Heaven? when Christ
saith, <hi>Except you repent you shall all likewise perish,</hi>
Luk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13. 3. Will not you own your Madness,
that look'd for Life in your Disobedience, when
you shall hear our Lord saying, <hi>Slay these mine
Enemies, that would not that I should reign over
them,</hi> Luk. 19. 27. Is it not an establish'd Rule
under the Gospel, <hi>He that believeth not shall be
damned,</hi> Mar. 16. 16. Unbelief and Hell are
certainly connected, as Faith and Heaven.</p>
            <p>3. Thy Folly appears yet more, in that thou
fanciest thou canst be saved in a way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Salvation, and certainly leading to
Hell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:48747:14"/>
Wouldst not thou judge him a Fool that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
for <hi>Dover,</hi> yet chuseth the Road to
<hi>York?</hi> are not they Fools who desiring Health,
refuse Physick, and take nothing but Poyson?
Thy behaviour exceeds the grossest of these
Instances.</p>
            <p>What barrs any one from Heaven, but the
dominion of sin? and that Conscience justly
chargeth thee with: Doth not God declare,
<hi>that to be carnally minded is death,</hi> Rom. 8. 6?
thou art so minded, and yet expectest life:
Is not God express, that <hi>no Whoremonger, nor
unclean Person, nor covetous, hath any Inheritance
in the Kingdom of God,</hi> Eph. 5. 5? And also
that the <hi>abominable, and all Liars shall have their
part in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,</hi>
Rev. 21? Is he not as positive, that <hi>no
Fornicator, Reviler, Thief, or Drunkard can be saved?
1 Cor.</hi> 6. What can be plainer, than that in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such as these thou destroyest thy self?
These Vices lead to destruction, and God
warns thee against foolish self-deceit, by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
for a better issue than Ruine by such a
Course: Oh sottish Youth! will Theft, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness,
Swearing, Prophaneness, think you,
lead to Heaven, after all these discoveries of
God's resolves? what will damn thee, if such
Vices will not? who can be damned if thou be
saved? will a provoked God lye for thy sake?
No, no, his Threats will take hold of thee,
notwithstanding thy silly dreams.</p>
            <p>Children, you see I have described the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48747:15"/>
of all Young Ones, who are wicked. I
have chosen this great Instance, <hi>viz.</hi> They mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
their true Happiness, and the Way
to it.</p>
            <p>I might open this great sore beyond this:
Alas! Young People are generally ignorant of
God, and themselves; they know neither good
nor evil aright; they commend what they
ought to dispraise; they chuse what they should
reject; they make a mock of the greatest
Mischiefs, as Sin and Hell; they rarely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
Men, or know how to carry it aright
for this World, or for Eternity; they mistake
Truth for Error, are governed by appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
rather than realities. Where shall I stop
if I intend a full attempt of the Folly of
Youth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> What shall I that am Young do to
heal me of my Folly?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Beg Wisdom of God by fervent
Prayer; <hi>Iam. 1. 5. If any of you lack Wisdom,
let him ask it of God,</hi> &amp;c. Thou wantest Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
thou art bid to ask it: Thou art en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to ask, for he giveth it to such as
ask, yea, <hi>he gives liberally,</hi> and he will not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid
thee with thy past Folly, when thou set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
thy self to get Wisdom. Nothing will heal
thy Folly but wisdom, and a prayerless creature
is never like to obtain it: Therefore press thy
Soul with the sence of it's want, and with the
loveliness and necessity of Wisdom: This will
help thee to strong desires, which are fervent
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48747:15"/>
Prayers. Oh Child! wilt thou be a Fool for
want of praying? Shall God say, Here's a
Youth void of Wisdom, because he would not
ask it?</p>
            <p>2. Study and believe the Scriptures. If thy
Judgment bedirected by the Word, it will be
sound, <hi>that gives understanding unto the simple,</hi>
Psal. 119. 130. Be sure you learn to read, and
when you can read, read the Scriptures most;
there you must learn to think aright of God:
they will teach thee what the Will of God is;
the way of Salvation is there discovered; from
them thou hast the truest account of Sin, and
Holiness. In the written Promises thou wilt
know what to hope for, in the Threatnings
what thou shouldst fear, in the Commandments
what thou must do, in the revealed Doctrines
what thou shouldst believe. Come Children,
you are allowed to learn the Scriptures; <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>
is commended for <hi>knowing the Scriptures
from a Child,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 15. Study you these,
there is nothing needfull for a Christian which
is not contained therein: Every thing as to
Salvation is doubtful, which is not deduced
from these.</p>
            <p>3. Suspect thy first thoughts, and never be
governed by thy Fancy. If thy sudden imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
be right, they will bear enquiry; if
they be wrong, they need amendment. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
the first dictates proceed from Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and shall that prescribe when Life and
Death depend on thy Resolves? nay, how
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48747:16"/>
knowest thou but that they be Satans whispers
which thou executest, when Fancy is thy
Guide? for he speaks to the Soul by impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Imagination.</p>
            <p>4. Converse with the Godly Wise, and
strictly observe and lay up their Sayings and
Examples. The Word tells us, He <hi>that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with wise men shall be wise, but the Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of fools shall be destroyed,</hi> Prov. 13. 20. Their
Speeches will instruct, their practice will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
imitation; whereas ill Company will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch
thy Mind, and nourish thy Lusts. Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Persons will judge thy temper by thy as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociates,
well knowing, thou art already, or
wilt certainly be what thy chosen Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are.</p>
            <p>5. Design all knowledge in order to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
and live up to the light thou receivest.
He that in Sacred things takes up with Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for notions sake, is as truly a Fool as if
he knew nothing. It's a practical Judgment
that makes us spiritually wise, when other
knowledge will aggravate our sin and woe.</p>
            <p>Oh Young Man! wilt thou say <hi>unto Wisdom,
Thou art my Sister?</hi> Prov. 7. 4. wilt thou cast off
Folly with Indignation as thy great Disease?
should you be fond of that which sin introduced,
and will obstruct your healing whiles it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails?
Folly is the bane of intellectual Beings,
and that's of the worst sort which guides our
practice. Folly is the root of all your other
Sins: Wer't thou spiritually wise, thy work
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48747:16"/>
were more than half done; and methinks thou
shouldst not be hardly perswaded to get Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Child! wouldst thou be willing to be
an Ideot? Surely no: every one pitieth such
a one, and is too apt to laugh at him. But I
tell thee, to be a Fool as to Eternal things,
is much worse than to be an Ideot: The Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot
hath few, if any actual Sins to answer for,
but thou hast many. There may be hopes of
an Ideots Salvation, especially if he be the
Child of a Believer: but if thou remain spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
a Fool, there's no hope of thee, tho'
both thy Parents were the best of People. All
Folly is the blemish of Humane Nature, but
Spiritual Folly most of any.</p>
            <p>2. Young People are subject to Inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateness
and rashness. How hard is it to make
you think, or lay the greatest things to heart?
neither Danger nor Duty, do Young Ones ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to themselves. Would not the Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of most of you agree with my accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if I tell thee Child, and thee Young Man
or Woman, Thou art under God's Wrath,
but wilt not consider it? Thou dost not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
on the way of recovery, tho it be at
great expence provided: Christ dyed for thee,
but thou hast not spent one hour in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of him. Thou art loth to think
what thy wayes are, whether good or bad;
nor thy State, whether safe or dangerous.
How few Young Ones here have seriously ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves; Am I born again or no? what
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48747:17"/>
will my sins bring me to? what evil is there
in my Sins? when I must stand at Gods Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
to be judged, what shall I answer?
what is like to be the issue? how shall I dwell
with everlasting burnings? It's too common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with others as it was with that Young Man,
<hi>He goeth after her straightway,</hi> (or suddenly)
<hi>as an Oxe goeth to the slaughter, till a dart strike
through his Liver: As a Bird hasteth to the snare,
and knoweth not that it is for his life.</hi> Prov. 7. 22, 23.
He took not time to think what would be the
issue of Sin? unavoibable Torment gives the first
prospect of his danger; when consideration
would have represented this Misery, as a
guard against Sin, even whiles Temptation
solicited.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> What shall I a Young one do, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
me from this inconsiderateness?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> In general, strive to consider, and
bind thy mind to suitable and fixed Thoughts.
To this end,</p>
            <p>1. Do not at any time allow thy Thoughts
to wander unaccountably. It's hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
them at any time, when they usually rove.
It's a great help for this World, and for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to have our thoughts manageable; and
our Souls capable of being easily fixed in their
Contemplations. When ever thou thinkest,
be able to say, What I think of, it is worth
a thought.</p>
            <p>2. Awe thy Soul with the importance of
the things thou oughtest to consider. If they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48747:17"/>
be Soul-matters, they be of the highest nature,
and they be of greatest concern to thee: Tell
thy self, Life and Death depends on these: If
Sin have dominion over me, <hi>I shall dye:</hi> If I
am not born again, <hi>I cannot enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God,</hi> Joh. 3. 5. And shall I lightly
think of these? what's all the World to me,
if I perish for ever? Things Divine, things
on which Eternity depends, must be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Oh my Soul! wilt, yea darest thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to dwell on these, which thou wert made
for, which thou must shortly converse with,
as the only realities, whether thou wilt or no.</p>
            <p>3. Get so much Knowledge of what thou
shouldst consider, as that thou mayst be able
to represent it to thy Mind in some evidence.
It's hard to consider long of what we little
know; if it be of God, be not unacquainted
with his Nature; if it be of Sin, be not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of arguments to disswade from it, and
a sence of what aggravates it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Learn to discourse with thy self, and to
urge things upon thy Heart: This will fix
thy thoughts, and bring things with some due
impression on the Heart. If thou canst not
debate the matters inwardly, speak outwardly
with thy Tongue, as if two Persons were in
talk together: What, shall I lose my Soul
for a Lust? Must not I, if Gods Word be true,
rue my present Course? It's Gods charge that
<hi>you commune with your own hearts,</hi> Psal. 4. 4. he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48747:18"/>
can neither be true nor profitable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who seldom speaks to himself.</p>
            <p>5. Take fit time and place to debate, and
apply things of most concern, and bring
things to a good conclusion. Great things
must not be determined by a few thoughts, for
so thou wilt neither pass a right judgment,
nor yet be duly affected. Neither are serious
matters becomingly considered in a Crowd, or
when thou art unfit to think: And to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
without coming to a conclusion, cannot
fix thy Judgment, or govern thy Will and
Practice. Therefore if the matter thought of
be a Doubt, press it to a resolution; if it be
a Duty, consider all arguments 'till thy Will
be fixedly determined to do it; if it be a Sin
which thou layest to Heart, cease not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
the evil and danger of it, before thou
feelest thy self resolved against it, and a strong
indignation kindled to support that resolve.</p>
            <p>Will you resolve to follow these Rules?
will you strive to manage your thoughts, and
shew your selves willing to be considerate? I
am sure thou wilt not refuse, if thou hast
a mind to chuse aright, to walk safely, or
to have the benefit of what God hath afforded
by natural Light, Revelation, or Providence to
govern Mankind by. Yea, Young Man, it's
impossible to be truly Religious, or to answer
the great ends of Religion, without considering.
Oh then <hi>ponder the path of thy feet,</hi> maturely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
on things that thy thoughts are due to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:48747:18"/>
3. Young People are subject to be obstinate
and heady. This is one of your diseases;
you break through restraints, and are regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
of advice, intreaties avail little: Yea
Children, though you be compared to tender
Twigs, do not you discover much stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
Parents command, but you are disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient;
they correct, but you remain obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
they perswade and intreat you to be
sober, but you are still vain: Masters reprove,
you are still the same; Ministers importunately
call thee (Oh Young Man) from thy destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Course, but thou passest on, and shuttest
thy Ears against the Word. Conscience oft
speaks, and represents thy guilt, but thou
seemest resolved on thy own ruine: Yea, God
stands in thy way, as the Angel with a drawn
Sword; but thou art fearless, and seemest to
say, I will sin still, let come what will of it:
<hi>Iob</hi> 15. 26. Let guilt grow, let God strike,
let my Soul perish, all these shall not alter
me.</p>
            <p>Oh poor Stripling!<note place="margin">Disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive from Obstinacy.</note> how soon can
God undo thee! how soon will Hell
Torments break thy Stomach! and
wilt thou still be like the <hi>wild Ass which snuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth
up the wind, and in her occasion, who can
turn her away?</hi> Jer. 2. 24. How canst thou,
Child, endure to hear thy Parents groan: I
perswade my Child to be good, but I cannot
prevail! I would instruct him, but he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teachable:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48747:19"/>
Woe is me, I have brought forth
for the Destroyer, when this my Child was
born: I see him running Hell-ward, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
restrain him: I tremble to think from his
setting out, what he is like to come to: Oh
that the fruit of my Body should dishonour
God, as he is like to do! that he should do
the Mischiefs, I foresee he will! If God change
not his Heart, he may come to an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> untimely
end, and is sure to be damned for ever! Oh
that I had been written Childless! canst thou
be unmoved, and still perverse?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> How shall a Young Person be cured
of this Obstinateness?</p>
            <p>1. Get thy Heart possessed of a holy Fear:
Beg of God a Heart that is in awe of him;
a Heart that reverenceth thy Parents and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours;
a Heart afraid of Sin, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
at Hell, and all other punishments due
to Sin. Fearlesness is a great ground of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy:
Young Man, these deserve fear; God
hath put this Passion into thy Nature, to make
thee governable. What horrid madness is it,
not to fear a God who <hi>is a Consuming Fire?</hi>
Heb. 12. 29. Not to fear Hell and Misery,
which will force thee to weep and wail, <hi>and
gnash thy teeth for ever?</hi> Mat. 22. 13. What a
confusion and disorder is it among Mankind,
that Inferiors are wholly fearless of their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,
especially sinful Worms of a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
God?</p>
            <p>2. Believe the kindness of these, against
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48747:19"/>
whom thou art obstinate, and stir up some
grateful returns of love to rhem. Thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseness
implies, that thou lovest not thy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visers;
nor thinkest that they have any love
to thee, when they advise thee. But young
Boy, I would mind thee to day, that it is from
Love all these opposed Admonitions do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.
Doth not God love thee, who made
thee, who put such Bowels in thy Parents to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thee? Doth he not love thee, who
gives thee all the good thou enjoyest, who
spares thee, and intreateth thee month after
month, when he might have sent thee to Hell
at first, without any loss to himself?</p>
            <p>Doth not Christ love thee, Oh Child, who
gave his Life for thee, when thou wert an
undone Enemy to him; who sent his Spirit
to strive with thee, his Gospel to offer Mercy
to thee, his Ministers and others to teach
thee, as soon as thou couldst understand any
thing? must not he love thee, young Man,
who pleads with God ready to cut thee down,
<hi>Lord, let him alone this year longer?</hi> Luk. 13. 8.
Doth not he love thee, that weeps over thee,
when he finds thee unperswadable, and this
becaufe he knows the woful anguish thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
will end in?</p>
            <p>Do not thy Parents love thee? Oh think at
what care and pains thy Father is at for thy
livelihood: Think of the tender bowels of
thy Mother, what sorrow she hath selt, what
fears she is in, when thou art in danger;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48747:20"/>
what tears she poureth forth when thou art
sick, and how it goeth to her Heart to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
thee? I might shew all others love thee
who advise thee to be good.</p>
            <p>Well young Body! canst thou chuse but
think that the reproofs of these must proceed
from love? and art thou such a Brute as not
to love them at all? what not love thy God
who is so good to thee? Not love thy Christ,
who bled out his Soul in love to thee? what,
not love thy Father and Mother, to whom
thou art so indebted? wouldst thou be so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited,
when thou hast Children?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> I hope I do love God, Christ, and my
Parents. I am not such a Devil, and I think
they love me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> What, love them, and be obstinate
against their intreaties? Love them, and be
disobedient in things they most insist on: God
and Christ account <hi>them Enemies,</hi> Luke 19. 27.
that are Rebels, and puts thee plainly to it,
<hi>If you love me, keep my Commandments,</hi> Joh. 14. 15.
As if he should say, Never fancy or talk that you
love me, unless you will obey me. Thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
if they be pious, will reduce thy love to
the same instances: Thus thy Mother bespeaks
thee; <hi>What my Son, and the Son of my Womb,
and what the Son of my vows! Give not thy
strength to Women,</hi> Prov. 31, 2, 3. and so she
<hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. forbids Drunkenness. Thy Father
charges thee, My Child, <hi>hear the instruction of a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48747:20"/>
Father: Let thy heart retain my words, keep my
Commandments, and live; get wisdom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi>
4. 1, 4. They will both intreat thee; Child,
if thou hast any love for us, keep from sin,
save thy self from Hell; we are most concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to see thee a real Saint, and eternally glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;
we'll bear any thing rather than sin;
we are afraid for nothing as much as thy Soul,
if thou destroy that, thou shewest the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
hatred, and art as cruel as thou canst be
unto us.</p>
            <p>Canst thou think thou lovest them, and
be thus perverse? Nay, if thou think they
love thee, that must cause some relentings:
How can I run so cross to my God and to my
Parents, who so dearly love my Soul, and are
so solicitous for its weal? my hardned Heart
begins to yield, and I cannot continue obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
my Love to them, and my sense of their
Love to me, doe overpower my stubborn
spirit.</p>
            <p>3. Be perswaded of thy own ignorance and
unfitness to direct thy self.</p>
            <p>A proud conceit that you know better than
any, what is for your good or harm, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in an obstinate frame. Dost not thou
think, that if thou wert convinced that God
bids thee do nothing, but what were for thy
good, nor forbids thee any thing but what is
for thy harm, thou would'st do what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
and cease from what he forbids? and
would it not be the same as to thy Parents and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48747:21"/>
others? Let me then reason with thee, Young
Man! Dost thou think thy God would deceive
thee, or thy Parents and Ministers would lye
to thee; when they disswade thee from sin,
and perswade thee to serious Piety, and are so
earnest in it? thou must conclude they think
as they say: If they be not mistaken, they
would encourage me to do as I do, but if I be
mistaken, I ought, and would do as they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise.</p>
            <p>Then young People, the Matter is brought
to this; thou art obstinate against Counsel,
because thou art in the right, and they that
give thee Counsel are in the wrong: They as
thou thinkest, advise thee to thy loss, and all
things set together, thou consultest thy own
true Interest better than they do.</p>
            <p>But is not this a very vain Conceit and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
Error? Oh Child! sure thou art not
wiser than thy holy Parents! they know more
than thou, they have experienced what thou
hast not; they and thy Masters are forced
to teach thee the little things of this Life;
thou would'st soon spoil and kill thy self, if
they left thee to thy own management.</p>
            <p>Oh young Men and Women! are not you
sordidly foolish? can you imagine you know
what God will do with you better than he
knows it? do you know what you must lose
by sin, and suffer for sin, better than God
knows? you judge by a short moment, but he
sees what Eternity is: You conclude from
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48747:21"/>
what your Body now feels, but he knows what
thy Soul is, and what himself is to the Soul,
whether in Wrath or Love: He knows what
the Glory of Heaven and Terrors of Hell
amount to: Thou concludest by thy Fancy,
but he passeth a just Judgment, which every
one will soon submit to; therefore I do begg
thee to distrust thy self, as ever thou wouldst
save thy self. Consider, all the good Men in
the World were Conceited as thou art now,
but they have repented, and owned their Folly:
when they came to their right minds, then
they came to be of God's mind. Yea, all the
Wicked will be convinced of their Mistake;
why else will they wail and mourn for ever?
if it be best to be in Hell, why should they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
Complain there? The Prodigal thought
he was wise when he rioted, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 17, 18.
but Repentance assured him that he had been
mad.</p>
            <p>Young Folk, have you never seen resolved
Sinners even in Sickness and Poverty, roar
out, and mourn at the last, saying, <hi>How have
I hated Instruction?</hi> Prov. 5. 12.</p>
            <p>Consider how unlikely is it, that thy Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is truer than thy holy Master, or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster?
thy Lusts darken thy mind, they have
all the wise part of the World on their side.
Thou canst remember thou wert as confident
of other things, which now thou seest to be
false, as they told thee then. Thou some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
now condemnest thy self for thy course,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48747:22"/>
when thy sinful Inclinations are calmed. When
thou wert sick, thou didst own that thy loose
way, thy irreligious way was thy Folly: And
after all these wilt thou bear it out? must that
be thy Character, <hi>The Fool rageth, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
whiles thou knowest not at what thou stumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest,</hi>
Prov. 14. 16. Must this be written on thy
Grave-stone? <hi>He shall dye without Instruction,
and in the greatness of his folly he went astray,</hi>
Prov. 5. 23.</p>
            <p>4. Acknowledge thou art one under Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and not at thy own disposal. People
refuse to be subject, from a Conceit that they
have a right to govern themselves. Is not this
your Case? <hi>Our lips are our own, who is Lord over
us?</hi> Psal. 12. 4. therefore I will Lye, Swear,
talk frothily, let who will contradict.</p>
            <p>But Child, thou canst tell who made thee,
it was God; and should not he that made thee
govern thee? ought not the Creature to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Laws which his Creator gives him?
Nothing thou hast is so much thine as thou
art his: Christ bought thee with his Blood,
and additionally founded his Dominion in his
Purchase: <hi>He therefore dyed, that he might be
Lord both of the dead and living,</hi> Rom. 14. 9. Thou
art therefore the most unjust of Rebels, if thou
art an obstinate Sinner.</p>
            <p>Thy Parents, thy Masters, thy Ministers,
have an Authority over thee, and disobeying
their just Commands and Calls, is a renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
an Authority thou shouldst own, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48747:22"/>
usurping a power, to which thou hast no
claim. A Masterless Child, a masterless Youth
is a Slave under pretence of Liberty; and
doubleth his yoak, while he seeks to break it.
Therefore know, young Folk, you'll find God
a terrible Judge, whom you rejected as a Law-giver:
Hee'll vindicate his own Authority,
and the deputed Authority of your Parents,
by the sorest Vengeance. Eternal Chains shall
hold that Youth, which would break God's
easie bands.</p>
            <p>If any of you say, I do own God to be my
Ruler and Master, consider God's challenge,
<hi>If I be a Master, where is my fear, saith the
Lord God of Hosts?</hi> Mal. 1. 8.</p>
            <p>To finish this, how many sturdy resolute
Young People are here? will none of your
knees tremble; will love melt no Heart, will
a sence of Gods skill to direct, and authority
to Command, bend no stubborn will this day?
Dare any Child or Young Person go hence,
and say, I have been stiff-necked, and wll be
so; nor will I follow these Rules to become
more perswadeable. If thou hast the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to do thus, I have God's warrant to
tell thee, <hi>Thou shalt suddenly be destroyed, and
that without remedy,</hi> Prov. 29. 1.</p>
            <p>4. Young People are subject to Anger and
violent Passions.</p>
            <p>Children are apt to be peevish and cross:
Young Men to be full of rage; the Verse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Text may be rendred, Oh young man,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48747:23"/>
               <hi>put away anger from thy heart:</hi> How soon is
the fire kindled, how fervently doth it blaze?
Young Persons are oft angry with their best
Friends, even for what they should be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
they are incensed too freqneutly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a cause, and are so hasty, as not to search
the reason. Sleighty Matters are with them
great provocations; and moderation in their
resentments they disdain: And no wonder,
for thy Reason is darkened from seeing the
fatal consequences of thy Fury. Lasting En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
Quarrels, Murthers, are too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the effects of this inordinate fervour.</p>
            <p>Young Man!<note place="margin">Disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive from Anger.</note> is this a thing allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able?
Consider with thy self, anger
is a short madness. Thou losest the
management of thy own Soul; whence our
Lord Commands, <hi>in patience possess your Soul,</hi>
Luke 21. 19. An overheated Spirit is void of
Prudence, and sure to procure bitterness to
its self. God saith, <hi>he that is soon angry dealeth
foolishly;</hi> and truly, he that is very angry
is next to mad; he looks, he speaks, he acts
too near a Lunatick. A Passionate Man is at
the mercy of any designing Foe; and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging
his Anger becomes his own Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor:
how uneasie to his Family, how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to himself; how unfit for Counsel, how
troublesome to his Friends, how ensnaring
and infecting to Society, is a Passionate Man?
May not I hope, you young Ones will be out
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48747:23"/>
of love with Anger; it unmans you, though it
seems brave: It makes you contemptible with
the wise; 1 Tim. 6. 11. but above all, argue
with your selves, This my God forbids me,
<hi>Let all bitterness, wrath and anger be put away,</hi>
Eph. 4. 31. This will unfit me for the visits of
the Spirit, who loves a calm Temper, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
2. 8. and therefore appoints <hi>meekness,</hi> Jam. 1.
21. as a qualification for communion with
him in his Ordinances. How lovely is pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
it's the height of fortitude? Yea, God
saith, <hi>He that rules his Spirit, is better than he
that takes a City: and he that is slow to anger,
than the mighty,</hi> Prov. 16. 32. In a word, a
meek and quiet Spirit is an Ornament, and
describes one <hi>Blessed,</hi> Mat. 5. 5. How ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
is a patient Child! he is more beloved
by all than a froward one! How excellent is
that Young Man, who is Master of his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on!
He is armed against sudden assaults; he
is fit for great services and sufferings; he
is fit to use the knowledge he hath attained in
the most dangerous passages of his Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> What shall a Young Person do to be
healed of Anger, and unruly passions?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. In general, get the Grace of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and delightfully accustome thy self to
the exercise of it as thy Glory, and no way
a Reproach: But more particularly,</p>
            <p>2. Get thy Heart filled with Love to God
and Man: Love to God will encline thee to
imitate him, who is long-suffering, slow to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48747:24"/>
anger, full of Love, and good to all, <hi>Luke
16.</hi> 35. Love to Man will encline thee to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
all to the best, afraid to hurt him,
willing to benefit and forgive him; and not
prone to those dislikes, which are unsuitable
to thy fellow Creature; especially if the
Image of Christ be enstamped on him, as you
see 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 45, 7.</p>
            <p>3. Often present to thy Soul the Example
of thy Saviour, and strive to imitate him: he
was humble, meek, lowly, and patient under
the greatest provocations. He calls thee to
<hi>learn of him,</hi> Mat. 11, 29. If thou hast any
part in him, he hath formed thy Soul to some
degree of imitation, and to endeavour after
more, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
            <p>4. Reckon on provocations, and be still
armed against them. Thy own Carriage is
not so inoffensive, nor are thy Acquaintance
so innocent, but that thou oughtest to expect
some Trials; to expect them, and be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded,
is Folly; neither is it possible to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
anger when wholly unprepared: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
awe thy Soul against Passion, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
thy Mind to such Considerations as are
fit to restrain thy Spirit.</p>
            <p>5. Be humbly convinced how mean, sinful,
and ill-deserving a Creature thou art. Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is from Pride, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 10. and he is
fondly conceited of himself, who thinks he
ought to bear nothing; whereas a due sence of
thy own nothingness, and offensiveness to God,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48747:24"/>
will make thee fit to endure much; especially
considering, thy provocations from Men may
be the humbling rebukes of thy God, who
must forgive thee great things, if he cast thee
not into Hell it self: yet whose Decree it is,
<hi>if you do not forgive, neither will he forgive your
trespasses,</hi> Mar. 11. 26.</p>
            <p>6. Allow not thy froward Spirit a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
even where thou hast most power and
freedom. He that is not pettish at home,
will not be passionate abroad; whereas anger
indulged among Servants, and in trifles, will
expose thee to its power, when more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and indecent.</p>
            <p>7. When thou feelest Anger begin to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
forbear to do or say any thing, till thou
hast well considered. The cause of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments,
if just, will abide the thoughts of
a Calm Temper, and the wayes of thy vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
are far likelier to be due; whereas, if
the Cause in it self is too sleighty, or thy
sudden purposes are too severe to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
how darest thou take blind passion for
thy Guide? Thou must believe, that <hi>the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of a man deferreth his anger,</hi> Pro. 19. 11.</p>
            <p>5. Young People are subject to Idleness and
waste of time. It's a while before you are
fit ro learn, or do any thing; but when you
are capable, how commonly are you remiss
and sloathful? Were you left to your selves,
what would you do besides eating, drinking,
sleeping, and playing? Thou art put to learn,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48747:25"/>
and thou art idle at thy Book, not learning
in a week what thou mightest learn in a day
if diligent. Thou art a Servant or Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
having work to do, but art thou not a
Waster of that time, which is thy Masters,
and not thy own; and loath to do the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
incumbent on thee? How little do most
of our Youth for this World, or for Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
Sports and Idleness eat up that season,
which is the best opportunity of Life, and
the character of most young People is to
spend their time in doing nothing, or next to
nothing, or worse than nothing. You are idle
in the Duties of Religion, and waste that time
you pretend to employ with God: You are
idle in your particular Callings, as if you had
no business as Inhabitants of this lower World.</p>
            <p>Oh Young People!<note place="margin">A Disswasive from the idle mispending of Time.</note> how preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
is that time you do mispend!
and how sad an account are you
able to give of those hours, that
are not to be recalled! Will it be comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in this World to reflect on wasted Time?
Grown years will be full of these reflections;
I might have been a Scholar, my Knowledge
had been improved, I had now been fit to
serve my Countrey, and benefit my self and
Family, had I been studious in my Youth: I
might have understood my Trade, been encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
in my Calling by others, and laid up for
my subsistance, had I been diligent and industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48747:25"/>
in my Youth. But those years are spent in
Folly, and now I am unteachable: my Credit
is gone, ignorance, contempt and poverty are
my companions: Oh foolish I!</p>
            <p>But, Oh thou Child! Oh thou Youth! how
much more uncomfortable on a Death-bed,
and in Eternity, will thy idleness, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spent
seasons be, as they referr to thy Soul!
I had a teachable time, but I dye in ignorance
of God and Christ, woe is me! The seasons
of Grace I enjoyed are my torment now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I improved them not! I hardened my
Heart by neglects in my tender years: How
have I trifled when I heard Sermons! How
have I mocked God by my sleepy Prayers!
How have I undone my own Soul, by a foolish
remissness in all my seeming labours for it!
What can I shew for all the years I have lived?
To what a case have my Sports, my Idleness
and Vanity reduced me! Oh that I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
my precious Time! but that's impossible.
Oh that I had profitably employed those mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
seasons! that's as vain a wish: Oh then
that I had never lived those days which I did
not live; but sinned away as a sleep, or dead
in pleasures! 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
            <p>Darest thou, O young Body, for a little
present indulgence to thy fleshly sloath, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
thy self hereafter with such Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piercing
thoughts as these?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> How shall a Young Person be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of Idleness and waste of time?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:48747:26"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. In general, abhorr sloath, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
time, <hi>Prov. 19. 15. Eph.</hi> 5. 16.</p>
            <p>Sloath is a wicked unaptness for action, and
very unsuitable to an active Soul. Time not
redeemed is mispent, and when it is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to it's proper work, it passeth away to
no advantage.</p>
            <p>2. Enquire what is thy present work, and
be assured that what thou art about, is what
God would have thee do, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 23.</p>
            <p>Every hour hath it's business; if what thou
art about be not that business, meddle not
with it, but find out what it is thou ought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to be employed in at that time: Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of duty is a spur to diligence.</p>
            <p>3. Still remember, that God who is thy
Owner hath given thee thy Abilities, and that
time to do thy present work. God calls thee
as by Name, Use my Talents to this, which I
have made thy present work; in this thou
improvest the stock I lent thee, in this I will
bless thee, and protect thee as one pleasing to
me; for this thou shalt not fail of a Reward,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>4. Excite thy self to do what thou art about
with vigour.</p>
            <p>Engage thy strength, call up the powers of thy
Soul to activity, for <hi>the sloathful is brother to the
waster, Prov.</hi> 18. 9. Idleness is a degree of omission
in the affairs both of Soul and Body, for there
is much undone that might have been done.</p>
            <p>5. To this end consider, God will call thee
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48747:26"/>
to a strict account, how thy work hath been
performed in that time which God affords thee.</p>
            <p>Tell thy self, there's a time of reckoning
for this that I am now a doing, or a negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting.
The <hi>sloathful</hi> Servant is in Gods esteem
a <hi>wicked</hi> Servant, <hi>Mat. 25. 26:</hi> and he that
<hi>hid his Talent</hi> must perish, as well as he that
mispends it. The <hi>more</hi> good that might have
been done in such a day, will be observed, as
well as what little hath been done in that day.
Oh never forget, that vacant hours, and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
moments are recorded with him, who
will not inspect dreamingly, what thy slothful
Spirit makes no account of.</p>
            <p>6. Remember that all thy works prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
for Heaven, need an intense Spirit, and
are confined to a short season.</p>
            <p>It's proper Advice, <hi>What thy hand findeth to do,
do it with thy might; for there is no working in the
Grave, whither thou art going.</hi> Time is posting,
and we had need redeem it, because our business
is difficult, and the consequences great. There
are great things to be acquired and done before
we are meet for Glory. There be great opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in our Nature, and from our Tempers, to
every degree of that meetness. A vile Heart is
not easily renewed, darling sins are not soon nor
easily mortified; the necessary Faith, Knowledge,
Love, Strength, and Joy are <hi>hardly</hi> come by;
and the expected services in our generation
are slowly proceeded in. Haste and eagerness
are absolutely needful to such things. He that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48747:27"/>
idleth can hope for little, and trifling in such
matters is little better than downright neglects,
especially when <hi>giving diligence,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 10. is
as much a Duty, as doing any thing. He is
not upright in the matters of Religion, whose
deep concern doth not make him industrious,
because his Judgment never determined for
these things as the greatest; nor hath his
Will resolved the pursuit of them above all
others, whose idleness declareth his indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency.
Therefore oft tell thy remiss Soul,
This day is past, that week is over, and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
time will be at an end, and shall I idle as
I do? How little work is done in past years!
Dare I loyter still, and be surprized whiles
my works are so imperfect? or can I reckon
on greater improvements in the same number
of dayes, if I be no more intent and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
than I have been in those. To thee is
that directed, <hi>Not slothfull in business, fervent
in spirit, serving the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12. 11. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to obey it.</p>
            <p>7. Be able to give a good account to thy
Conscience of the time that's laid out in sleep,
and Recreations.</p>
            <p>These are the common wasters of Time, by
a disregard to their just bounds. Many do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
divide their hours between Sleep, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creating
Sports, Visits, and Talk; which three
fall under this Head of Recreteion. It's an
awful Consideration, that what are appointed
only to fit Men for business, should become
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48747:27"/>
with many their only business: as if they had
little else to employ themselves about. But
know thou, Young Man, that he who sleeps
longer than Health requireth, is a Sluggard,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 9. And he that lays out more hours
in diversions than prepares him for the better
discharge of Duty, is a mispender of Time.
Thy Reason should tell thee, God would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have given me a Soul endowed with such
Abilities for service, he had never placed me
in a World full of opportunities and calls to
Employment: He had never so strictly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
me to be diligent and useful; if I am able
with Comfort to plead my Sleep, and Pleasures
as the greatest part of my Exercise whiles I lived.</p>
            <p>Attend to these Rules with Care, and from
this moment <hi>Gird up the loins of thy mind,</hi> as
one determined to run thy Christian Race with
intenseness and haste, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 13.</p>
            <p>6. Young People are subject to Levity, and
inordinate Mirth.</p>
            <p>This is a common distemper; your talk is
frothy and unsavoury. How far from grave
are you in your Carriage, or Dress! Vain
Books thou lovest to read, idle Tales thou lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to hear, foolish Sights thou art best plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with, foolish Songs thou greedily learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est:
what airy Conceits is thy Imagination fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with! These thou indulgest till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Guides of thy practice, and chief
Object of thy thoughts and Discourse: To say
nothing of thy Instability, excessive Laughter,
vain Jestings, Merriments. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Oh young ones!<note place="margin">Disswasive from Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> is this a Temper
to be allowed? it is condemned by
all prudence, it's contrary to all that
is serious, and obstructs all improvement in
wisdom. How odious is the character of a
<hi>vain Fellow!</hi> 2 Sam. 6. 20. How do God and
Angels despise thee! How do the Good and
Wise compassionate thee! Yea, canst thou
refuse to be angry with thy self? Reason a
little with thy own Soul: Have I not better
things to think of, than these silly matters,
which tend to no good for Soul or Body? Do
not these antique gestures make me ridiculous?
What hurt to others, what a wound to my
self comes by this frothy talk! Is not my
mind grosly vain, that I can relish such foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?
Can it ever be bettered, whiles I employ
my self in nothing but what is foolish? Dost
not thou find, that this lightness is even risen
to prophaneness? Thou canst ridicule the
Scriptures, sport with the Divinest Subjects,
and turn the most serious matters into Fuel to
thy childish Conceits: Poor Wretch! God
will force thee to be ferious by the Torments
hee'l shortly inflict: Thou wilt be convinced,
that thy Atheistick thoughts have not put God
out of his Throne, though they cast thee out
of his Favour: Thy ridiculing of Religion hath
not made it less real, or necessary; though it
hath excluded thee from all the blessings of it.
Thy <hi>making a mock of sin,</hi> Prov. 14. 9. hath
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48747:28"/>
not a jot lessened its evil, but exposed thee more
to the Vengeaance due to it. Thy jocular
temper shall not delay the awful recompense
of that Contempt wherewith thou hast treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the gravest Matters: What is more fit to
make a serious Heart bleed, than to see thee
jest and fool thy self into eternal Flames? how
surprizing will those Torments be to a poor
Creature, that always disdained a sober
thought, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 46.</p>
            <p>

            <p>The want of these is evident in thy frothy
Behaviour, and a total want of them is unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
thee in the early exercise of thy Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

of an old Man cannot be expected in a

for, but to discern what is meet, direct
thee to what is fit, and govern thee in thy

Discretion will tell thee, a godly Book
is more profitable than a Play-Book; the Soul

that will shortly be Meat for Worms; that

thy Vanity, as well as expose a Christian
Name; it will urge thee to refrain matter of
future sorrow, for the sake of that contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
pleasure which thou takest in indulging a
light Fancy, whiles more important things
are not regarded.</p>
            <p>To this end,</p>
            <p>1. Oft represent to thy self thy Condition
in this life.</p>
            <p>Sure it must conduce to seriousness, when
thy mind is accustomed to such thoughts, as
thy present State suggest. Oh young Man!
thou art born a <hi>Child of Wrath,</hi> Eph. 2. 3. thy
Nature is vicious, the condemning Sentence
was pass'd on thee by the Law of Innocency,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. Death is justly fearful, thou art in
a state of Trial, and on thy good Behaviour
for an endless Joy or Misery. Thou hast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
much guilt by thy actual Enormities
and Omissions: Satan, the World, and thy own
Lusts, are active to fix the Curse, and prevent
thy reconciliation with God, by keeping thee
in a state of Infidelity, Impenitency, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
to the Gospel. Thy Exercies as a
Christian are difficult, if thou art saved, it
must be <hi>scarcely,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 18. and many endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
for Salvation do prove ineffectual, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a perseverance in so many things are
essential to determine thy State. Alas! of
many called how few are chosen! multitudes
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48747:29"/>
of Professors miscarry, seemingly strong hopes
are oft delusive: <hi>The Heart is above all things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful,
and so desperately wicked,</hi> that it may well
be asked, <hi>who can know it?</hi> Jer. 17. 9. These and
the like things may call thee to mind thy self,
and lay that froth which argueth small sense
of thy bleeding Wounds, slippery Paths, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages
and dangers attending thy Case in
this Life, as it leadeth to Eternity.</p>
            <p>2. Deliberately propose a becoming End in
all thy Words and Actions, and let them be
conducive to that end. To speak or act thou
knowest not why, is a reproach to thy Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
and so it is to speak or do things to
an end which they are not fit to serve: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it becoming a serious Person, to intend
that which will put him to the blush, whiles he
deliberates of it. I can hardly think thou da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
say to thy self in thy Closet, I'le spend so
many hours to day in shewing my own Folly, or
gratifying anothers Madness; I'll lay out my
Pains to divert my own mind or anothers from
all that is serious, to make my Heart vainer
than it is, to furnish my self with those false
Notions of things, which I must with trouble
unlearn before I be wise; and to strengthen that
levity, to which I am already too prone. Canst
thou resolve, I will spend this week in trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a poor Carkass, and neglect my Soul;
let this shift for it self as to any care of mine,
unless it be to add to its hurt by the snares
which my vain conversation shall expose it to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:48747:30"/>
But if thy design be what's edifying, thou
canst not imagin a course of Foolery will ever
accomplish that design. Yea, this very fixing
on warrantable Purposes, will gradually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
thee to seriousness.</p>
            <p>3. Remember thou art still under the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of such, as should awe thee to Sobriety,
and make thee ashamed and afraid of a frothy
behaviour.</p>
            <p>Thou wouldst be ashamed, that a wise Friend
were acquainted with all thy light Francies and
talk but one day. Oh! forget not that God
trieth the reins, and <hi>knows all thy thoughts,</hi> Isa.
66. 18. Poor Youth! is not the Eye of thy
God and Judge more than all the World?
Holy Angels are not always strangers to thy
Carriage, and Discourses; and mayst not thou
blush at their Remarks? Devils do oft im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
thy Fancy, and put those things into thee,
which thou thinkest and talkest of; these Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of thine do gladly behold thee unmanning
thy self, wounding thy Soul, and corrupting
others with thy foolish Speeches and Actions.
Thy silly Companions observe thee, and receive
the Contagion to which their own Inclinations
make them apt: And is it nothing with thee,
that thou conversest with People ready to be
diverted from seriousness, and forward to be
vain by thy Example? Alas! thou becomest
accessory to all the evil they shall propagate;
and wilt be condemned in their thoughts, if
God give them Repentance, or cursed by them
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48747:30"/>
in Hell if they dye impenitent. Thy ungrave
Deportment sometimes is seen by such as are
wise and good, those despise thee, and pity
thy Madness, when thou pleasest thy self as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
airy and witty.</p>
            <p>4. Be not an unconcerned Stranger to the
State of the World, where enough daily oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currs
to make thee serious.</p>
            <p>Canst thou be light and altogether vain in a
World so full of Sin and Misery? how many
dismal Objects dost thou see and hear of! what
Cruelty in one Man to another! how oft is the
Church oppressed! what Judgments and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
are thy Neighbours under! what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
is the Land of thy Nativity exposed to!
Most of the Earth lies in Ignorance, Idolatry,
and subject to the Devil's Empire, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 19.
how many Souls are bemoaning their own sins,
and ready to despond under Doubts and Fears!
where is there a Family but groaneth under
some disaster? and canst thou play the Buffoon,
as if Childish toys diverted thee from all sense
of these things?</p>
            <p>5. Awe thy Soul with the importance of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
things, so as not to dare to entertain a
light thought concerning them, much less to
speak jestingly of them.</p>
            <p>Every Scripture truth is a beam of Divine
Light, it's revealed by the eternal Spirit to
Mankind, for to direct their Faith and Practice,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. and dare a poor Worm that shall
be judged thereby, affront Heaven by ridiculing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48747:31"/>
its Discoveries? Young Man! they cannot be
matter of Jest, which the holy and wise God
is intent on, and the Hearts of all devout Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are deeply exercised with. Are such
things to be sported with by Man, which the
very Devils tremble at? Canst thou chuse but
be seriously affected with the Matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
if thou believe, these are the things the
Incarnation, Sufferings, Death and Testimony
of the Son of God referr to? These are the
things which great Miracles have attested:
These are the things which the various Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Holy Ghost on Souls design, and the
Ministry of Angels subserve: These are the things
which the Devil is so industrious to oppose:
These are the things a Gospel-Ministry is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
for, and about which all pious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
are so intent and importunate: These are
the things which most affect, and govern all
such who are freed from the Dominion of their
Lusts, and can dye with hopes: These are the
things which if totally disregarded expose
Mankind to all bruitish Villanies in this World,
and endless Tortures in another?</p>
            <p>6. Abstain the Society of light Persons, and
observe the danger of excessive Mirth.</p>
            <p>There's that levity in thy temper which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs
danger by vain Persons; and thou art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate
if the latter doth not force thee to
say <hi>of Laughter it is mad, and of Mirth, what
doth it?</hi> Eccl. 2. 2. <hi>Yea, sorrow is better than
laughter, for by the sorrow of the Countenance
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48747:31"/>
the Heart is made better,</hi> Eccl. 7. 3.</p>
            <p>7. Acquaint thy self with those purer and
higher Joys which a serious Temper lead to.
There be delights of a higher Nature than
what thou pursuest; they would soon render
these unsuituble to thy taste, as well as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
to thy judgment: No holy young
Man would exchange the <hi>feast</hi> of his heavenly
Father, for thy Swinish <hi>husks;</hi> Luke 15. 16, 23.
there's no present emptiness, nor following
bitterness in Spiritual Delights. The sence of
Gods Love, Peace of Conscience, the lively
hopes of Glory, the satisfaction of well-doing,
the serenity of a composed Soul, the ease of a
rectified Nature, as far as the Faculties are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from Sin, and healed by Grace, do
constitute a delight so real, and refined, as if
thou once taste, will make thee reflect on thy
past Joys with shame and disdain. See <hi>Psal.
4. 6. Cant.</hi> 2. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>7. Young People are prone to lye: This
Sin appeareth in Childhood, and then such a
habit is contracted, as they hardly are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from. It's now true of many, <hi>They go astray
as soon as they be born, speaking lies,</hi> Ps. 58. 3. You
lye to your Parents, to excuse your Faults;
You lye to God, in breaking your Baptismal
Vow. You lye to your Equals for pleasure,
or gain: You speak falsly, to revenge your
selves on such as you are angry with. Oh
how oft do you speak otherwise than you think,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48747:32"/>
and contrary to what you know, deceiving
them to whom you speak!</p>
            <p>Consider thou Child,<note place="margin">A Disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive from Lying.</note> lay to Heart
O young Man, that Lying is a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Sin: Herein thou imitatest the
Devil, who <hi>is the Father of a Lye,</hi> and the first
Liar, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 44. Thou art contrary to God,
who is a <hi>God of Truth;</hi> to him <hi>lying Lips are
an abomination,</hi> Prov. 12. 22. He is so incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by this Sin, that he allots every <hi>Liar his
Portion</hi> among the worst of Sinners, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 15.
Oh Child! wouldst thou get to Heaven? then
thou must not lye: Art thou afraid of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Hell for ever? then fear a Lye: Wouldst
thou be a Child of God? He tells thee, his
<hi>Children are such as will not lye,</hi> Isa. 63. 8. It's
the Charge of God to thee; <hi>Put away lying,
and speak the truth,</hi> Eph. 4. 25. Darest thou say,
I will not regard what the Lord saith to me!
Alas! he will punish thee for a lie, worse than
thy Father or Master can punish thee for any
Fault.</p>
            <p>Young Men, allow not your selves in this
Iniquity; let no Master force you to lye in
your Trade, much less do you use it in your
Discourse; it's a mean thing, it's destructive
to Humane Society, and the bane of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.
What is a greater Reproach than to
be a Liar? What is esteemed a worse Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front,
than to say thou lyest? Great are the
mischiefs to Mens Repute, Estates, Peace, by
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48747:32"/>
a false Tongue; and in vain be all pretences
to Religion, if <hi>the Tongue be not bridled,</hi> as to
this fault, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 26. How hateful is it to
debase so noble a thing as Speech, in delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thy Brother in thy Communication with
him!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> How shall a Young Man avoid Lying?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Love Truth, and despise what
would allure thee to quit it in thy Speech. It's
the Character of him that shall inhabit God's
Temple, <hi>He speaketh the Truth in his heart,</hi> Psal.
15. 2. To speak the Truth argues a plain Man,
an honest Man, an Heroick Man, and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Godly Man. Therefore, like it in thy
self, as thou must do in another: In order to
this, get rid of slavish fear, which induceth
to lying excuses. Hate Pride and vain Glory,
whence all Lyes for ostentation proceed; tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
on love of filthy lucre, and thou wilt not
lye for gain: Abborr a hurtful envious Spirit,
which will prevent those lies that are framed
to the damage of thy Neighbour.</p>
            <p>2. Be wary and thoughtful of what thou
art about to speak. He that speaks hastily is
in danger to speak falsly; and having uttered
one lye in haste, is too apt to back it with
more; whereas he that is sparing in his words,
doth not easily betray truth; and he that
considers, dare hardly utter a false thing. Who
will venture to lye, that says within himself,
God hears what I am going to say, and he
will judge me by my words? This restraint
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48747:33"/>
on thy Speech is so needful, that thou shouldst
pray, <hi>Set a watch, O Lord! before my mouth,
keep the door of my lips,</hi> Psal. 141. 3.</p>
            <p>3. Let the lies thou hast uttered at any time
be to thee matter of deep humbling. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
sorrow for what's past, will be a
strong caution against the same fault; thy
grief for it will make thee earnestly pray with
<hi>David,</hi> (whose fault this was) <hi>Remove from
me the way of lying,</hi> Psal. 119. 29. They sleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confess a lye who can persist in it.</p>
            <p>4. Take heed of Equivocation, which is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
downright Lying. What is blamed
in Jesuites is too usual among Protestants:
as if a poor Artifice would compensate truth.
To conceal thy meaning where thou dost not
owe a discovery of it, is warrantable; but
to impose delusion under pretence of truth,
is intollerable, especially where Rules of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
are violated. How sad is it! to observe
the liberty some take in deceiving their Friends
with ambiguous words, which they hope will
be interpreted contrary to what they know
to be true.</p>
            <p>5. Do not be encouraged by Reports, to
publish what thou hast not just reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:
What false slanders do some utter on
incredible evidence! <hi>Report, say they, and we
will report it,</hi> Jer. 20. 10. as not daring to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the lye, yet not scrupling to repeat what
they more than suspect to be false: But learn
thou, never to say any thing of thy Enemy
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48747:33"/>
upon worse testimony than thou wouldst be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it of thy Friend.</p>
            <p>6. You that are subject to correction, be
watchful and innocent in your Carriage, that
you may not need to lye. Do nothing that thou
needest be afraid to own. This will prevent
falshood; and thy fear of being put to lye,
may guard thee against many irregularities.</p>
            <p>Here I would advise Parents and Masters to
encourage truth, by abating somewhat of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities
for Faults, that are plainly confessed.
And I wish, Buyers by their backwardness to
give a just price, would not tempt the Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
to lye, in bargainings for their goods.</p>
            <p>8. Young People are subject to fleshly Lusts,
especially Uncleanness. This Head concerns
Persons past Childhood, and therefore I direct
it to Young Men. You are not ignorant that
your Appetites are unruly, and your Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
too lascivious. In eating, you are prone
to Gluttony: Excessive drinking is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
a fault; there be many Drunkards short
of twenty years old: and Voluptuousness
seems the Idol. whom our Striplings worship
above the living God.</p>
            <p>Uncleanness is thy raging Disease: What
immodest Dalliance, what filthy Thoughts,
what obscene Speeches, what wanton Looks,
Self-pollution; yea, actual Fornication, doth
Conscience charge some of you with! How few
<hi>possess their Vessels in honour,</hi> 1 Thes. 4. 4. or arrive
at Manhood without a forfeiture of Chastity!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:48747:34"/>
Thou that art apt to Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,<note place="margin">A Disswasive from Fleshly Lusts.</note>
or Gluttony, oughtest to
consider, what these Vices are, and
how vile thou rendrest thy self, by indulging
thy self therein: Sure thou forgettest thou
art an imbodied Soul, whiles thou art led by
thy brutish Lusts. The Name of Christian ill
becomes thee, <hi>Whose God is thy Belly,</hi> Phil.
3. 19. Where is thy Reason, that thy Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
should thus rule thee? What is thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
that fails to terrifie thee out of sins,
so undoubted, and dangerous. Shall God put
thee off with a portion that becomes a Beast,
and when thou askest Heaven, reproach thee
with <hi>faring sumptuously every day, and receiving
thy good things in this life?</hi> Luke 16. 19, 25.</p>
            <p>Oh Drunkard! how odious art thou to all
that behold thee! how subject to do and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the worst of Mischiefs! Thy Enemies have
an advantage to betray thee; Satan may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
perswade thee to the greatest of Sins,
when thy Soul is in no case to see the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or the consequences of it. What secret
art thou able to keep? what business art thou
fit to do? how do reproach and penury wait
thy persisting in this Course? But above all,
dost thou lay to Heart, that God is incensed
against thee? He left it a rule to <hi>Israel,</hi> that
Young Man should stoned, against whom his
Parents witnessed, <hi>that he was a Glutton and a
Drunkard,</hi> Deut. 21. 20. It is the sanction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48747:34"/>
the Gospel, that <hi>Drunkards shall not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11. Is thy
pleasure worth the pains thou must endure,
or the loss thou shalt sustain?</p>
            <p>Oh Unclean Person! how dismal is thy case!
This Lust blindeth thy Judgment, and sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
thy Conscience, so that Misery becomes
unavoidable by a stupidness in Sin: How da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
thou worship a holy God, whiles thou
wallowest in thy pollution? Doth not thy fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness
make God a terrour to thee in every
Duty, as well as defile the Duty by the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings
of a vile Imagination? The Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is quenched by lustful motions, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
dwell in a Heart so unclean, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19.
Thou professest to belong to Christ's Body;
hear the Apostles expostulation, <hi>Shall I take the
Members of Christ, and make them the Members of
a Harlot?</hi> God forbid: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 15. How oft,
O Young Man, hath the Spirit of God repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
thee? How oft hath Conscience bitterly
warned thee? and darest thou waste thy Body,
debauch thy Mind, ruine thy Estate, deface
all hopefull impressions on thy Soul, renounce
a Christ for a base Lust, defie God to avenge
the Affronts, and for ever undo thy self, and
them whom thou allurest to partake in thy
Lasciviousness? Then admit that as a holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve,
<hi>Let us walk honestly as in the day, not in
rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and
wantonness, but put ye on the Lord Iesus,</hi> Rom.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48747:35"/>
13. 13, 14. and take heed least God give thee
up to vile affections, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> How shall a Young Person be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from Gluttony and Drunkenness?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Set thy self to get the mastery of thy
Appetite. Reason with thy Soul, and cry
earnestly to God, that this may not be thy Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler:
None would be a Glutton or Drunkard,
but that his Appetite hath more power than
his Reason; and Conscience is too weak to
resist the cravings of his Lust: most young
People are pleased that the Beast should rule
the Man; they quietly yield up themselves to
the Empire of this brutal part; they can bear
no check to it, they are afraid it should come
under restraints. But, Oh young Man! thou
art carnal or spiritual, as thy Appetite or
sanctified Reason govern thee; much of a
Christians Warfare consists in the struggle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
these; the inordinate appetite is a great
part of that <hi>Flesh which lusteth against the Spirit,
and is contrary to it,</hi> Gal. 5. 17. Is it not high
time thou shouldst set thy self to contend with
this Enemy, and attempt to bring it into sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection?
This is Temperance, when thou canst
restrain its irregular motions, and deny its
cravings: Oh then, daily quench this fire, and
press after that Sobriety, which implies a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of Soul to the objects of sense, and a
Government of our Life by the Will of God,
and not by fleshly desires. Let it then be thy
business in every duty to weaken this Tyrant,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48747:35"/>
and the scope of thy Life to deliver thy self
from the power of thy Appetite.</p>
            <p>2. Make no provision for the Flesh to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
it's Lusts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 14. It's afflictive to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
some Persons contriving for their Bellies,
as if carefull for nothing else; it's the design
of their labours, and the thing that makes
Riches valuable with them, is, that they may
pamper the Flesh, and fulfill it's desires. But
resolve with thy self, thou wilt not minister
to this flame, nor live as if catering for the
Flesh were thy principal employment in this
World. Prepare what is meet for thy Body;
it's a mercy in our Pilgrimage to have the
conveniencies of Life; but excesses are fittest
for them who dare brutishly say, <hi>Let us eat and
drink, for to morrow we die,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 32. Poor
Worms! is there nothing after Death, that
they should live in preparation for? yea, is
not Life it self as bad as Death, whiles it serves
to no higher an end? nay, these voluptuous
Courses do often so enfeeble Nature, and
multiply Diseases, that Life is a burthen, and
some beginning of Hell in bodily Torments.</p>
            <p>3. Avoid Temptations according to thy
weakness to resist them. He that's prone to
slip, ought the more carefully to look to his
ways: Is Gluttony thy Crime? be afraid of
Feasts; Art thou apt to be Drunk? look not
at the Wine when it sparkles; refrain the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in compliance with whom thou hast so
oft offended. Knowest thou not, <hi>that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48747:36"/>
of riotous persons shameth his Father?</hi> Prov.
28. 7. It's in vain to pretend, I will not be
drunk, though I do associate with them
that will perswade me to it. How oft hast
thou resolved, and yet complyed! Nay, thy
delight in the Sin is plain in the choice of such
Associates, and thy Lust is strong enough to
prevail when the Temptation offers, if it be
able thus before hand to lead thee into the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
            <p>4. Force thy self to an abstinence from just
liberty for some time, when the strength of
thy Lust is found to abuse what is otherwise
lawfull. Some People are so exorbitant, that
if they drink any Wine, they must drink to
excess; if they go into a Tavern at all, they
cannot forbear Drunkenness; if that be thy
case, do not despise it as below Vertue, for a
while to drink no Wine at all, or wholly to
forbear a Tavern or Alehouse; it is thy mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that what is to another Man lawful, is to
thee a snare: but it is thy Duty and Wisdom
to manage thy self with a regard to thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that thou mayest by degrees get rid of
thy wickedness.</p>
            <p>5. Be content by watchfulness and hard
struggles to oppose thy Lusts, till time and
frequent repulses abate their power. An ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
long indulged is not soon brought under
the power of the Soul; it will be importunate
and uneasie, even after it's dominion is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
much more whiles the contest for Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48747:36"/>
between it and Grace is undecided.
Therefore sink not, as if it were in vain to
strive; nor let the uneasiness of the struggle
tempt thee to give it over; for as yielding to
the flesh makes it more impetuous, so frequent
denying it will abate the strength of its moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Many Drunkards after a while become
rid of all Inclinations to be drunk; and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
grows so habitual to them, as if excess
had never been their Temper. Oh Children!
never make your Cure hard by beginning a
wicked Custom: Oh young men that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared!
grieve not to be at due pains, nor pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
to wait the stopping the Course of sin,
which thou hast strengthned by frequent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances.
Thou must cease to be a Drunkard,
or thou art miserable for ever: And thou must
be at all the labour, and be willing to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
it till thou art reformed, or a Drunkard
thou wilt be still.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Quest.</hi> How shall a young Man be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from Uncleanness?</p>
            <p>The former Directions are proper to this
Case; I shall apply somewhat of them, and add
some more Rules.</p>
            <p>1. Awe thy Soul with the Purity and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Gods Law, as it referrs to this Sin.
It's a great snare to mistake a Precept, and
confine it below God's explication of it, or
intention in it: yet how many Young People
allow themselves in degrees of Uncleanness as
innocent, not seeing, that these things are
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48747:37"/>
comprehended in that Precept, <hi>Thou shalt not
commit Adultery:</hi> Therefore Young Man! exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Word more strictly, and thou wilt
find that God hath provided against every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of uncleanness, and against all that leads
thereto. Are thy hidden thoughts and motions
free? No; the <hi>thought of foolishness is sin,</hi> Prov.
24. 9. And our Lord reproves the Pharisees as
Hypocrites, because <hi>their hearts were full of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness,</hi>
Mat. 23. 27. <hi>Evil concupiscence, inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
affections,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are to be mortified,</hi> Col. 3. 5.
Are thy lustfull Gazings on a Woman allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
No; our Saviour expressely saith, <hi>He that
looketh on a Woman to lust after her, hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
adultery with her already in his heart,</hi> Matth.
5. 28. Mayest thou talk Obscenely? No;
<hi>Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting,
are convenient, nor to be once named among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
Eph. 5. 3, 4. If the Command of God
reach to these lesser degrees, sure thou art
not so stupid, as not to see that all grosser
acts are forbidden, as more abominable. And
if Marriage be the remedy against Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
thou darest not think that God allows
thee other wayes to gratifie thy lust, and so
frustrate the great ends of that Ordinance,
and the aptitude of humane Nature for it.</p>
            <p>2. Be watchful against all occasions of Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Nourish not Lust by an intemperate Diet.
He had need be free from fleshly Inclinations,
who dare strengthen the assaults of the Flesh
against his Chastity. The Spirit of God tells
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48747:37"/>
thee, that <hi>if Wine prevail, thine eyes shall behold
strange women,</hi> Pr. 23. 32, 33. Be not in the reach
of a Woman that will entice thee. <hi>Ioseph</hi> esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the snare by <hi>flying</hi> from his Mistress, and
refusing <hi>to be with her,</hi> Gen. 39. 10. Whereas
the Young man that admitted the Speeches
of the immodest Woman was soon ensnared,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 21. Venture not on thy own strength
too far, God may justly leave thee, when thou
temptest him; and stronger than thee have
sadly rued the power of Occasions. Play-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
mixt Dancings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have been the ruine
of many a Youth.</p>
            <p>3. Guard thy Senses. These are inlets of
evil, by them. Objects insnare and kindle those
Lusts which lay asleep. <hi>David</hi>'s Eye betray'd
him into Adultery. <hi>Iob</hi> is to thee a good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<hi>Iob. 31. 1. I have made a Covenant with
my Eyes.</hi> Listen not to immodest Songs, or
lewd Discourse, which insensibly stir up those
Inclinations, which tend to the vilest Acts.</p>
            <p>4. Stifle the first workings of Lust. First
motions are weakest, and so more easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd;
the longer they are entertained, the
more violent they grow; and the Soul less
apt to oppose them. Filthy Contemplations
allowed, darken the Mind, and abate that
dread and abhorrence which are a great part
of thy security against sin: Oh then crush the
first appearance. If thou ask me, how? I'll
tell thee, Banish these evil thoughts out of thy
Mind, plead God's Command, and seek his
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48747:38"/>
help; represent to thy self the Threats and
Punishments of God against this Sin; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that these Motions unrestrained, may end
in the grossest Action: and resolve not to
speak a word, glance one look, or use one
gesture, in compliance with that sinful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>5. Avoid Idleness, as that which tempts the
Devil to tempt thee. Young Man! it's a great
Mercy to the World that we have business to
follow; and he that hath no Employment,
will wish hereafter he had never had an Estate
to prevent a Calling; therefore be sure thou
hast work, and attend it. Sin easily intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth
the Idlers, who will be doing wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for want of Business: But the Diligent is
not at leisure for vain thoughts, he needs not
ensnaring Company to divert him; yea, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
substracts matter from Lusts, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the Body less disturbing to the Soul.
Leisure hours are the young Mans danger, be
not desirous of too many such, and double
thy Watch in thy spending of them; for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
observes thee then, and will suggest vain
thoughts to thy Mind, excite fleshly motions,
and prepare ensnaring opportunities.</p>
            <p>6. Attentively regard, and yield up thy
self to the motions of the holy Spirit. The
Spirit will warn thee against these Defilements,
and direct thee to that purity of Heart and
Life, as will prevent the advantages the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
Spirit finds in thy youthfull Age. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verential
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48747:38"/>
regard to the presence of the Spirit,
will call the mind from base Employs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
thee to what is approved by him: The
more his Fruits abound, and express them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in thy temper and carriage, the more
effectually wilt thou be cleansed from all thy
fleshly pollutions. To this we are directed,
<hi>Gal. 5. 16. Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not
fulfill the Lusts of the Flesh.</hi> Yea, the aids and
influence of this holy one are necessary to a
saving abstinence from, and dominion over
Lusts, as you see in <hi>Rom. 8. 13. But if ye through
the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the Body, ye
shall live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Keep thy thoughts well employed. This
will prevent those vain Imaginations, which
are the incendiaries of Lust, and by which,
the Judgment is blinded or bribed to perswade
the Will; <hi>Let the Word dwell richly in thee,</hi> by
filling thy Mind. Contemplate God in his
Perfections, behold him present with thee
when in greatest secrecy; he makes a third,
when thou and thy Paramour are most reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
In this case he testifies, <hi>Ier. 29. 23. Even
I know, and I am witness, saith the Lord.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
to thy Soul the Torments following
these Lusts, if gratified: Hell-fire is enough
to quench these lustful Flames; and who dare
wish the pleasure so dearly bought? Attend
to such Scriptures, as, <hi>Whoremongers and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers
God will judge,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 13. 4. Oh Young
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48747:39"/>
Man! canst thou think of this believingly, and
cast off restraints, or give a Carnal Mind
it's scope?</p>
            <p>9. Resolve before thou compliest with the
most urgent Temptation, to put up a serious
Prayer to God in Christ. Lay thy self under
this Law, I will not consent before I look to
God; it must be a dreadful evil, that will
not admit an Address to Christ; if it be a sin,
I have need of strength from him, who came
on this errand, <hi>to put away sin, to cleanse me
from Iniqtity,</hi> and <hi>destroy the works of the Devil,</hi>
Heb. 9. 26. Eph. 5. 26. 1 Joh. 3. 8.</p>
            <p>Prayer may deaden the Temptation when
strongest, it may recover thy baffled power,
for Christ is able to inspire thee with that
light and vigour, as may support thee when
almost gone. St. <hi>Paul thrice</hi> prayed when grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with a thorn in the flesh, and the <hi>Grace
of Christ proved sufficient for him,</hi> 1 Cor. 12, 8, 9.
The Devil, the Flesh, and an enticing Object
are too hard for any Man, that calls not in
the help of Christ by Prayer. Satan desires no
more, than to engage thee single, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
frequent supplications, thou art like to
be so: On the other hand, Prayer will drive
Satan to some more subtile Assault, than so
gross a wickedness as Uncleanness must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to every one, that beholdeth Christ when
calling on him. Therefore, I do again intreat
thee, even when thy Lusts seem to have most
advantage, that thou wilt not forget to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48747:39"/>
thy case to him, who is concerned for
thy good, and able to foyl the Enemies of thy
Soul, when in greatest prospect of success.</p>
            <p>Thus I have represented to young People
some of the sins, to which your Age is most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
All are not named, alas! there's Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which is a prophane Villany, that hath
neither pleasure nor profit to allure; there's
Theft, which is a violation of Justice, and a
discontent with what God hath thought fit
to give you; there's Pride, (one instance
whereof I shall hereafter speak to) which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you Children and Youth is generally on
very fordid accounts; you are proud of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Beauty, which the Small Pox may spoil,
and no Body is truly the better for; you are
proud of your fine Cloaths, and from Pride
desire them; but what trifles are these, none
but Fools esteem them, or value thee the more
for them.</p>
            <p>Though I cannot insist on these, yet if God
is pleased to deliver thee from such sins as I
have mentioned, all others will be reformed:
Oh then set thy self against them! let the
youngest be warned against these, as what
they will feel temptations to. And be all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
faithfully to observe the Directions
given; that if possible, you may arrive to
middle Age, free from the corruptions of
Youth and Childhood, and not be forced to
cry out with bitter reflections, <hi>Thou makest me
to possess the Iniquities of my Youth,</hi> Job 13. 16.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48747:40"/>
What would an aged Saint give, that he had
been innocent of all these Crimes whiles he
was young? Learn wisdom by such now, whiles
thou hast opportunity and warnings.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to the second head of the
Vanity of Childhood and Youth, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Children and young People are apt to
live to no valuable purpose, which is Vanity.
Thou wilt easily allow, that to spend ones
strength and time for nothing, or for what is
as good as nothing, is vain. Is not he a vain
body, that thinks much, talks much, and doth
much, to no purpose? Common opinion will
grant this, we brand <hi>Caius Caligula</hi> as vain,
for bringing a great Army to the Sea-shore,
and gathering Cockle-shells, when he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a great attempt. The Spirit of God just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accuseth those Persons, <hi>Isa, 41. 29. Behold
they are all vanity, their works are nothing. Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
doth frequently mean this in his Book of
<hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> when he saith, <hi>This is also Vanity;</hi>
that is, it's to no valuable purpose; it is not
worth the labour and concern a man is at:
One had as good let it alone, and be unem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
as reap no other fruit.</p>
            <p>Young People! this is your very Case:
Most of you live, and busie your selves for
nought.</p>
            <p>1. You are apt to design nothing at all in
your living. It's long before thou askest thy
self, What do I live for? What end shall I
pursue? are not most of thy actions perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48747:40"/>
thou knowest not why? Most of you are
hurried by a foolish Temper, allowing no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
design to govern you. A vain mind,
or Devilish suggestions determine the actings
of most Young People. Is not this a reproach
to thee, if thou happen to do any good,
it's more by chance than by thy choice?
If thou receivest any real advantage, it's by a
merciful Providence, and not by thy Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
If God should ask thee at the Church
Door, wherefore comest thou hither? May
not some of you say, I do not know, or it
was from a fancy I had to hear, or from
custom. But how few can say, I had a design
to get some help to grapple with my youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
lusts, I proposed to meet with God in his
Word for my Souls improvement. When you
intend so little in an Ordinance, what purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
must govern you in the ordinary affairs
of Life?</p>
            <p>2. Your Youth is spent to no considerable
purpose. May not I tell most here, thy time
past is lost, and the time to come is like to
be lost: For,</p>
            <p>1. Thou hast lived in vain as to thy self.
What hast thou gotten by the ten years thou
hast lived, Oh Child of ten years old? What
hast thou improved by the fifteen years thou
hast lived, Oh Youth of fifteen years old? yea
may not I as justly ask the Young Man of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
What hast thou done? what use hast thou
made of thy twenty years? Must not Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48747:41"/>
answer, Oh! I had as good been just now
born, for any good I have gotten?</p>
            <p>That I may fasten this Conviction, I call
every Soul to answer me; what art thou near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
God to this day? how much is Sin morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?
what Grace hast thou attained to this
very time? Oh youth! hast thon yet got an
Interest in Christ? what Treasure hast thou
laid up in Heaven? If thou must own, I am fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from God, and not nearer: Sin is stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and not weakned; then sure thou wilt own
thou hast lived in vain to thy self.</p>
            <p>2. But yet farther, how many others may
lay to thee the charge of unprofitableness?
Thou livest in vain as to God: He may say,
This young Body never served nor praised me:
I had as good there had not been such a Youth
in the World. Thou livest in vain to thy
Friends, thy Parent may say, It is an unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Child to me, I have yet had no comfort
by him. Thy Relations may cry, He never
gave us good Counsel or Example. Thou liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
in vain to thy Master; he hath got little
advantage by thy care, or labour. Thy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
may cry, This young body brings me lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
joy as yet: I have striven to little purpose
with him; he seems as if I had <hi>laboured wholly
in vain,</hi> 1 Thes. 3. 5. Thou hast lived in vain
to the Church; what increase or Glory hath
it reaped by thee? Thou hast lived in vain to
the Nation; thou hast not helped to make it
more innocent by thy Life, more flourishing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48747:41"/>
by thy industry, or more safe by thy Prayers.
So that now, Young man! is it not a true
Charge, which I lay to thee? mayest thou
not cry out, Oh useless I! I have lived for
nought, I have been an useless shadow, I have
cumbered the ground, and God may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cut me off as an unfruitfull one? <hi>Luk.
13.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> I foresee some Young one will be ready
to evade this Charge, and say, I do live to
some purpose that is valuable: I gratifie my
senses, I live pleasantly, I begin to look after
the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Alas poor Creature! is living to the
Flesh valuable? Is living barely to this World
valuable? Is living to the Devil valuable?
Methinks thy Reason should tell thee, It's bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
not to live at all, than live to these: An
intelligent Spirit to live to the Flesh, is base;
an immortal Soul to live barely to this World,
is madness: A Creature of God, redeemed by
the Lord Jesus, to live to the Devil, is self-destructive,
and foolish. What! live to him,
who hath undone thee in the Fall, and is so
studious to prevent thy recovery by Christ!
Live to him who hath blinded, blemished, and
debased thee, as he hath done! Live to him,
who tho he hates thy God, cannot escape his
own misery! Live to him, who envieth thy
good, desires thy woe, opposeth all that is
the benefit of Mankind, and contributes to all
the miseries and disorders which the World
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48747:42"/>
is distressed by. Oh young man! canst thou
justifie this course of living?</p>
            <p>But this will more appear, if upon a due
reflection on thy Life, thou wilt answer me
these Questions.</p>
            <p>1. Doth thy Life answer Gods End and
Purpose, in giving thee a Being?</p>
            <p>The wisdom of God may assure thee, he
had an end becoming himself in thy creation:
he tells thee, <hi>all things were created by him, and
for him,</hi> Col. 1. 10. The blessed God had an
Eye to himself, and a regard to Christ the
Redeemer, in giving thee an Existence. He
exerted his Power in thy Being, that thou
mightest serve and honour him; dost thou
answer this End, by living as thou dost? hast
thou ever aimed at this? doth thy behaviour
contribute to this at all? Thy way of Life
would be a Reproach to thy Maker to have
proposed to himself in thy Creation.</p>
            <p>2. Are there not greater Purposes, to which
thy Nature and Abilities are suited?</p>
            <p>He lives to an unvaluable purpose, that
neglects to live to the <hi>highest</hi> Purposes he is
capable of. Little things are a reproach to
him, that is adapted to great things. Have
not you Faculties, to know, and love your
God? and do your childish or wicked em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
answer them? You are capable to
serve, and glorifie the blessed God, and is
the gratifying thy lusts equal to these? You
are receptive of divine Joys, and are thy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48747:42"/>
merriments answerable to these? Oh young
Body! what use art thou fit for to others?
What benefit mayest thou yield to thy self?
how canst thou seem to answer these, by a
trifling diversion, or a perishing advantage?
Sure, thy Capacity is thy shame: the very
Beast, that liveth to the utmost of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
will witness against thee, who behavest
thy self so much below thine. It would have
been thy Mercy whose Exercises have been
so low, that thy abilities had been less.
Hence,</p>
            <p>3. Wilt not thou shortly acknowledge with
shame and grief, that thou hast lived to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable
Purposes?</p>
            <p>No Ministers rebukes will be so sharp as
thy own, when Grace renews thee, or endless
Torments overtake thee. If the Spirit ever
enlighten thy Mind, and alter thy Will, we
may ask thee, <hi>What fruit had you of those
things whereof you are now ashamed?</hi> Rom. 6. 21.
With a grieving blush thou wilt answer,
Nothing I dare boast of, nothing I can justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie:
I am ashamed of my Reward as well as
my Labour: What I reaped by Sin is my
shame, as well as sin it self; it was a
Fools Diversion wherewith I pleased my self;
it was my Blemish wherein I gloried; it
was my Loss whereby I valued my self:
What are they now to me? they are <hi>Dogs</hi>
meat (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) to what I now taste, <hi>Phil. 3.
8.</hi> I am astonished, that I could relish these
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48747:43"/>
unsavoury things, or derive the least Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from them, when my chief Good was
unsecure. Young Man! if Grace do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
thee, Hell will; the <hi>never-dying Worm</hi>
will be Convictions of the emptiness of what
thou hast pursued; and the base Purposes thou
hast lived to. How will they tear thy Soul
with such Thoughts as these! where's the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
now! where's the Satisfaction to which
my Endeavours were confined! oh, that I
had been but a Beast, who have lived to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
so brutish! Oh, that I had had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
Nature, being I studied not to know
my God, and the way of Life! Oh, that I
had been void of rational Powers, since I did
not govern my self accordingly! Oh, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
I had natural Abilities to love and fear,
being I have not loved my God, nor so reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him, as to abstain from Vanity! Wo is
me, that I had a Capacity for any Service,
seeing I have lived so uselesly to God, to my
Friends, and to my self! Alas, where is the
Fruit of my labonr! what now do I enjoy, that
deserved one hour of my life, or answers the
least of my Abilities! These, these, oh, Child!
will be the Effects of thy present way.</p>
            <p>3. Children and young People are apt to
live to <hi>destructive</hi> purposes, which is the height
of Vanity.</p>
            <p>The last Head is convincing, that it were
<hi>as well</hi> thou hadst never lived; but by this it
were <hi>far better</hi> for thee, thou hadst remained
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48747:43"/>
meer nothing to this day: to live to hurtful
Ends, is worse than not living at all; yet this
is thy Condition, you dishonour God, you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
the Eyes of his Glory, you trample the
blood of Christ under your Feet with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
How many young People serve the
Devil with their strength, are a Snare and
Infection to all they can influence? One young
body spoils many others, and leads them to
that Villany they had never thought of.</p>
            <p>You oft break your Parents Hearts, and
they by thy means feel, that <hi>a foolish Son is the
heaviness of his Mother,</hi> Prov. 10. 1. You fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
destroy your Master's Estate: To the
serious you are a Grief, to the City and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
a Plague, as helping on its Sin, hastning
its Punishment, and obstructing its Good:
How many may complain of Harm on thy
account! But whatever Hurt you bring to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
sure you avoid Mischief to your selves?
No, no: Young men live most to their own
Hurt, and seem to take great pains to make
their Misery sure and great. Oh, vain Youth! thou
daily makest thy self more the Child of Wrath
by thy sinful Practices; thy wicked Habits
grow more strong; by idleness and frequent
opposition, hopeful Principles are more baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
and expelled; Conscience by thy Affronts,
is less concerned, and capable to admonish thee.
Thy ill treatment of Gods Spirit, makes him
withdraw, and his Visits are more seldom;
so that he is ready to say of thee, <hi>Let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,</hi>
Hos. 4. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:48747:44"/>
Believe it, careless Youth! thy ways tend
to more sin, and less hopefulness of Grace and
Glory: Oh, wretched Life! to live only to be
more guilty, and to be exposed to greater
Punishments; thou runnest Hell-ward, thy
Thoughts tend there, thy Words lead there,
thy vile Actions heap the greater store of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Flames. <hi>Indignation and Wrath, Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and Anguish,</hi> are the things thou workest
for, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 8, 9. Thou labourest for these
Wages, thou livest thy self daily to a greater
obnoxiousness to these Woes, as if thou wert
afraid thou shouldest not be miserable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
            <p>Oh Soul to be pitied! not to be born had
been thy mercy, as well as <hi>Iudas,</hi> unless thou
change thy living, is it not to thee those words

               <hi>The next Work is to shew you,</hi> 1. How
Childhood and Youth became thus vain. 2. Why
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48747:44"/>
they continue so. 3. How most young People
grow still vainer.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Quest.</hi> How comes it to pass that Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
and Youth are vain?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Childhood and Youth became vain by
Original Sin.</p>
            <p>There's the Spring of the Disease, thou didst
not come out of God's Hand thus prone to
sin, and thus averse to himself. But a depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Nature descends to thee from <hi>Adam</hi> by
the Line of thy Ancestors: Thou wert born
under the Infection common to Mankind, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
in the ordinary manner; the very
quickened Embrio in the Womb, hath all the
Seeds of those sins, which time ripens, and
opportunity brings forth; our Constitution is
become sinful, and all corrupt Effects are next
to natural.</p>
            <p>I shall not trouble you with Disputes, but
meerly inform you, 1. How our Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
corrupt: 2. How it descends thus cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
to thee.</p>
            <p>1. Our Nature became corrupt or vain by
the entrance of Sin, whereby the Divine Image
was expelled as well as forfeited.</p>
            <p>A Rational Soul cannot be void of moral
Qualities and Dispositions, as it is a Subject
of God's moral Government; there must be
Wisdom or sinful Ignorance in the Mind;
there must be Love or Enmity to what is good,
and Aversion or Inclination to what is evil,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48747:45"/>
in the Will; for Man is not considered in
Gods Law meerly as an Agent, with respect
to what he occasionally acteth, but he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
also as to his temper, <hi>what he is;</hi> what
are his governing Principles, and prevailing
Disposition; those are necessary to the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
him a godly or ungodly Man, as
well as influential into the ordinary course of
his Actings, which will be answerable to his
inclinations and light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> was created after <hi>Gods Image,</hi> which
consisted in <hi>Knowledge, Righteousness, and true
Holiness,</hi> Gen. 1. 27. Eph. 4. 23, 24. Col. 3. 10.
This was his Constitution, tho' not so fixed,
as to prevent the possibility of sinning. And
whiles <hi>Adam</hi> sinned not, our Nature was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
with that holy Power, Light, and
Love, which answered the Law, and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
us for that exact Obedience injoyned
by it. These divine Qualities were inconsistent
with their Contraries, by the Law of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency;
tho' they are not incompatible by the
Law of Grace; for that Law insisted on Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and entire Innocency; and fixed a
Forfeiture of all holy Gifts, by man consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>any</hi> degree sinful; yea, besides this For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture
of these Gifts by the penal Sanction of
the Law, Man was not entitled to those Aids
of the Spirit, whereby Divine Qualities might
subsist in the same Soul with contrary sinful
Dispositions (as they do under the Law of
Grace) no snch influences of the Spirit were
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48747:45"/>
provided in the Law of Creation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as the least sin in the Soul brought down
our Holiness below perfect, and thereby made
it cease to be Holiness by the Rule of Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
for Love was not Love by that Law, if
there was any mixture of Enmity against God:
So sin would prevail to extinguish that Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and expel those holy Dispositions at first
implanted, if once it entred into the Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> did subsist a while happy under this
Law, but at last he sinned, his Heart turned
from God to the Creature, which implies Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in the Mind, and Aversation and Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to God in the Will. The entrance of
these did of Course deprave the Soul of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi>
Knowledge was expelled by Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
corruption removed his original Purity.
The Disease invaded the whole Man, the Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
operated to the extinction of his glorious
Excellencies; there was no need for God to
take any good out of the Humane Nature,
it necessarily died by the force of sin. And
it is by a new grant, that there be any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of God in lapsed man. It is not from
any thing in Man, or in the first Covenant, that
there be any moral Vertues, or good Nature
in any; God in mercy bestows these, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains
the growing Contagion of sin, that we
become not more devilish.</p>
            <p>When holy Light and Love were expelled
by Sin, the appetite (of course) became Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of our Reason, and all disorders hence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48747:46"/>
The Soul being cloathed with Flesh, doth
for want of holy Principles become subject to
sensible Inclinations, which through the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of agreeable objects, hurry poor Man
into all that is Flesh-pleasing: whiles the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
concerns of the soul are forgotten, and
its intercourse with unseen things is cut off,
for want of that Light which should perceive
them, and that holy Love which might relish
and desire them. A Soul thus debased and
entangled, becomes little better than an active
Power to contrive Fuel for our various Lusts,
and receive the little delights which are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
by Sense and Fancy. Oh wretched
state! especially when Error and Enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God and Holiness help to compleat its
depravedness.</p>
            <p>2. Thy Nature thus corrupted descended
to thee, as propagated by the appointed Law
of natural Generation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> was not only the common Head of
Mankind, as representing all meer Men, but
also he was the Original of all men in order
to propagation. As Representative, he was
capable to forfeit much good: As he was the
common Parent, he must transmit the Nature
which he had with its Impurities: he was to
propagate his Kind; <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 4. he begat <hi>Seth</hi>
in <hi>his own likeness;</hi> this is opposed to the <hi>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God,</hi> wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was made, <hi>v.</hi> 1.
Tho' <hi>Seth</hi> was the Father of the holier part
of the World, and a good man; yet he was
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48747:46"/>
not begotten after Gods likeness, or with a
nature in its Original purity, but with a
Nature as depraved in fallen <hi>Adam.</hi> Lapsed
corrupted Nature cannot propagate a holy
Nature. <hi>Can a clean thing come out of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean?</hi>
Job 24. 4. <hi>How can he be pure who is
born of a woman?</hi> Job 25. 4. A Person <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi>
sinfull, cannot generate a Child free from
that sinfulness: if the Father be naturally void
of spiritual Wisdom, the Son in the course
of nature will be so; and if we are born void
of Wisdom and Holiness, we must be vain,
foolish and ungodly; for humane Nature must
be unholy, if it be not holy. This made <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
own, <hi>I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did
my mother conceive me,</hi> Psal. 51. 5. This is so
fixed a Rule, that our blessed Lord must
have an extraordinary generation, to escape
the Pollution of humane Nature. <hi>Mary was
found with Child of the holy Ghost,</hi> Act. 1. 18,
20. <hi>The Spirit overshadowed her;</hi> and this Christ
is the only <hi>One born holy,</hi> Luk. 1. 35. Others
are made holy by Grace; some, it may be,
are renewed in the Womb, but none are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
so, or by Generation; therefore if
thou shouldst ask, Why do not good Men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
beget good Children? I answer, Their
goodness is superadded to their Natures, it
comes by another Law than that of nature;
their Grace is from Christ for the Salvation
of their own Persons, but not to propagate to
their Offspring by Generation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:48747:47"/>
Oh young Man! thou seest how thou groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
under <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, and labourest under
the depravedness of humane nature, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
from <hi>Adam</hi> by thy Ancestors down
to thee! And is there ever a Child here, but
is a living Witness to this Corruption? Are
you not all proner to sin, than holiness? Is
it not easier to make you vile, than to make
you gracious? Do not fewer and weaker Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
incline you to be wicked, than to
be godly? Is there not that in thee, which
serves instead of a Tempter to evil, tho there
were no ill example, or Solicitation from
without? Wert thou ever sensible of this,
oh, Child? hast thou been yet truly humbled
for Original Sin? Thou wert wicked whiles
an Infant, as to the temper of thy Soul; the
corrupt Nature thou then hadst, is the Spring
of all thy Vanity: Thy nature is to be foolish,
to lye, to be unclean, and what else is vile.
That nature whiles unrenewed, will express
its unholiness and enmity against God, one
way or another: it's true, the power of one
Contrary Lust, thy bodily Constitution, God's
Restraints, Education, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may prevent the
raging of some Lusts, but the malignity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth,
and cannot fail to govern, till the
Grace of Christ do alter thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. Why do Childhood and Youth
continue vain?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Childhood and Youth continue vain
for want of a due use of means appointed for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48747:47"/>
their healing. O young People, here are three
things in this that are very fit to move you.</p>
            <p>1. First, here's Comfort, that the Vanity
of Youth is healable; thy case is sad, but 'tis
not desperate; there's hope in <hi>Israel</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Recovery of Sinners in their Youth:
The Devils became wicked, and never can be
recovered; they may grow viler, but they
can never grow better; but blessed be God,
this is not thy case; the Wound though sad,
is yet curable: There have been many young
Folk made pious and serious. <hi>Isaac</hi> was good
betimes, <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were Old Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
before they could call Man. <hi>Iosiah</hi>'s ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
years were impress'd with Grace. I have
known undoubted Evidence of Grace before
ten year old: Oh then you need not resolve
to be vile, because 'tis in vain to attempt to
be good; no, no: No young Persons in this
Assembly need to say so, or need think so. God
has not resolved against Young Persons, that
they shall never be recovered; nay, he has deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
that <hi>out of the mouth of Babes and Sucklings
he will ordain praise,</hi> Psal. 8. 2. Children! Our
Lord Jesus has never said, he will have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do with such as you, I'll neither wash
you, nor heal you, nor teach you: Nay, he
has said quite otherwise, <hi>Suffer little Children
to come unto me, and forbid them not,</hi> &amp;c. Mat.
19. 14. The Spirit of God never resolv'd, I
will convince no wicked Children, I will san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
no prophane Youth; nay, instead of that,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48747:48"/>
to you he speaks, in <hi>Psal. 34. 11. Come ye Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
hearken to me, and I will teach you the fear
of the Lord.</hi> The Spirit has a Mind to be the
Teacher of Children, and the Instructer of
Youth, he has a mind to train up the Young
Generation for Heaven, as well as the Old
ones: So that Young ones may say to Day,
Why though I am wicked, yet there's hope,
and though I have a vile Nature, yet there's
hope. I may be recovered even though my
whole frame seems thus set for Villany, and
appears thus desperately dispos'd.</p>
            <p>There's the first point, and that's a great
matter, and under the power of that, I preach
to Young Ones, and under the hopes of that
you Young Ones should regard what I say,
and urge; for the case of Youth is healable.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, Here's a loud Call to you, that
God uses means to heal Young Ones of their
Vanity. This confirms the former: Is God at
pains with Youth to make them better? then
there's hope of Youth, for God would not be
at this labour if it were wholly useless: O my
Friends! God has sent his Son to dye for
young Children, as well as old Men, even
Young ones receive forgiveness by his Blood;
<hi>My little Children to whom I write, for your sins are
forgiven, 1 Ioh.</hi> 2. 12. The Spirit of God strives
with many Young ones, as soon as they can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
any thing; he bids early for your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance.
I do believe there's not a Child of
six years old under the Gospel Means, but the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48747:48"/>
Spirit of God has been striving with: This
holy One can truly say, I have been dealing
with this Child to make it happy.</p>
            <p>Pray let's a little consider: Thou Child or
Youth, hast thou had no sence of Hells misery
ever upon thy Heart? hast thou never been
convinc'd that 'twas ill to Lye or Swear? Hast
thou never found pressing motions to be good,
and to resolve against evil? have no good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
stirr'd in thy Soul? Why, all these were
the workings of the Spirit of God on thy poor
Soul. God has been labouring with every
young Body in this Congregation: He has
been labouring with thee, by the advice of
thy Parents, when they taught thee to read,
or taught thee thy Catechism, or instructed
thee to pray, it was God by them taking
pains with thee.</p>
            <p>We Preachers preach to you Young Ones,
as well as to the Old; nay, we preach to you
with more hopes, expecting that you are not
hardned as old Persons are. Young People!
have not the Mercies of God, have not the
preservations of God towards you, been so
many Teachers? What has been the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of every Mercy to thee Child, to you
young ones, but this? Oh Children! don't you
provoke this God; don't make me your
Enemy, for you see I would fain do you
good, I would fain be merciful, and not a
Destroyer of you: Nay, have not Afflictions
been the pains of God with you? Is there
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48747:49"/>
ever a Young one here, that has not been
sick at one time or other? Why the Lord
sent that Sickness to thee, and spake in
this manner thereby, I will warn this Young
one to be Religious, lest he should dye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he be converted; all the Corrections
of thy Parents, and Master, for thy Sin,
they have all been the Calls of God, and his
Language in them all has been, I would fain
imbitter Sin to this poor Young one, by some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
short of Hell: I would gladly restrain
the Wickedness of this Youth, before I must
damn him. You see, you had need look to it,
for God has used means towards your reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;
think not, God doth not mean me in his
Word; don't say, God did not intend my
cure in the helps I enjoy; alas, he intendeth
thee as well as any other. It's thy enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Oh Young Man! he intends by all his
teachings: 'Tis thy Conversion, O Young
Woman! that he designs by all his Calls, all
these have been directed upon this very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;
and least you should doubt it, the Spirit
of God does particularly name you: <hi>O Young
Men and Maids! praise you the Lord,</hi> Psal. 148.
<hi>Young Men be sober,</hi> Tit. 2. 6. Nay, Christ
himself tells us, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 4. that his great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
there, is <hi>to give discretion to the simple young
ones:</hi> Therefore I beg, that not one young bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in this place may forget what I say now,
that they frustrate God's hopes, if they be
not Good; and disappoint him of all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48747:49"/>
if they be not gracious, all the pains
that have been taken with them, are lost up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; and will God bear this? will he
always bear this? what will become of you,
if you proceed this way?</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, Here's an awful Charge, That
you young Men continue vain, because you
don't rightly use the means for your healing.
Ah, sad Charge! the case of young ones is
curable, but why is it not altered before
now? Why, O Conscience speak! Children
you have Consciences; Young Ones, you have
Consciences; Can you say 'tis long of God I
am vile still? 'tis long of the want of means
that I am vile still? Ah, Friend! Father,
Son, and Spirit can all say, 'tis not my Fault
that this Child is bad still; 'tis not my Fault
this young Man and Woman is wicked so long;
'tis not long of me. May not the Spirit of God
say, I have taken more pains with this Child,
and spoken oftner to this young person, than I
have done with thousands in the World: Alas!
so it is concerning every one of you. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Pagans in all their days never had thy
helps. Consider a little with your selves, God
may this day say, I begin early with this young
one: I have still pleaded after many a repulse, I
have followed him and her from day to day,
and from sin to sin: Oh, how earnest have I
been with this young Stripling, that I could
propose very little good by; yet have I ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
pains and labour with him. Come young
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48747:50"/>
People, is it now to begin? that God has cry'd
to you, <hi>Turn unto me, why will you die?</hi> Ezek.
33. 11. Is now the first time that he has said
unto you, <hi>When will you be made clean? when
shall it once be?</hi> Jer. 13. 27. Has Christ never
said unto thee, <hi>O look to me, and be saved?</hi>
Look to me for help, for there's help no
where else. Thy distress makes me needful,
and pity makes me willing. Lay these things
to Heart, and I will defie any young body
in this place, to go away, and say; I have
lived up to what I know, I have improved all
that God has afforded me, but he denied to
give me more: I am miserable and wicked still,
because God has refused to help me, when I
have sought it of him.—Is there any that can
talk at this rate? No, not one: Not one?
Why then whence is it that we have so many
young People bad still? Why still so fatal to
thy self? why a Slave to base Lusts? O Friends!
God knows the cause, and thou knowest the
cause; thou didst not use that knowledge
thou hadst; thou didst not improve thy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity;
doth not Conscience witness thy
Ear has not been opened, thy Heart has not
been attentive, <hi>thou didst not frame to turn unto
the Lord.</hi> Hos. 5. 4. God can say this day,
this poor Creature might have been in a good
case, he would have been serious before now,
if he would but have yielded to my plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
if he had turned at my Reproofs. This
young body would have been an eminent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48747:50"/>
before now, had all my Impressions been
retained, and all my Calls complied with;
he had known me better, had he been but
teachable in my ways, as he was in other
things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
            <p>Oh then, young People! Consider with your
selves what has been your case; you have told
God plainly, <hi>I will not come to thee that I
might have Life.</hi> Where's the young body
that has not practically given God a denyal?
And every time thou wert under Conviction
of sin, and didst not leave it, thou didst tell
God, Lord, I would be thine, but I love my
sin better: I would be happy for ever, but I
will not, unless I may be wicked in this World.
The youngest here hath the great hand in his
own ruine; he that is but of ten Years old,
if he perish, he is his own Destroyer: (I
think it's true of many younger.)</p>
            <p>Children! you were born vain, and you have
wilfully chosen to remain so: You may be
ready to accuse <hi>Adam,</hi> by whom you became
wicked, but it is your own fault that you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
wicked, since God hath provided a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy;
its your sin, that you are no better
for Mercies, no better for Affliction, no better
for Means; wicked before, and wicked still.</p>
            <p>O therefore! what will you be able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer?
how sad is it! that any young body
here should be forc'd to say, Lord, 'tis my fault
that I am no better for a Christ, and no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for the Gospel; my Misery is of my own
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48747:51"/>
choosing; God has taken pains with me, but 'tis
all lost through the obstinacy of my Will.</p>
            <p>These three things are plain under that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Head wherein you see why Young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
remain vile and vain.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, Youth becomes yet more vain
by evil Customs, and indulging carnal self:
vanity unhealed is of an improving nature;
and there's no bad Child, but grows worse:
Sin is not a Stream that grows empty, or a
Root that dies by meer time. God knows,
we have had experience of that. Alas, how
does Villany grow with Years! the Child that
began with few sins, grows up to many sins;
insomuch that we have some young men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
eigthteeen, have committed as great sins
as the man of eighty. Youth enters with les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
sins, and proceeds to grosser sins: We
have many young People that seem to abound
in wickedness, as they improve in age; as if
they grew older only that they may grow
viler. Oh, what a mercy would it have been
for those to have died in the Womb! or any
one year before another! Now, Sirs, whence
is it? how can it be, that young people should
grow vainer and vainer, instead of better and
better?</p>
            <p>I tell you, one sin brings on another, by
the lesser thou art fitted for a greater. Sinful
Habits are strengthned by sinful Acts: and
fear and shame for sin wear off, yea, are
even extinguished by a course of sin. O poor
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48747:51"/>
Soul! Satan has got the faster hold: The
Spirit has been provoked, and given over
striving; and it may be thy Parents through
Despair, have almost given over praying.
<hi>Conscience</hi> that warn'd thee, is <hi>sear'd</hi> and
silenc'd, and so the wicked Creature has
his whole Scope, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. God sayes
of him, Let this poor Creature alone, <hi>I'le
strive</hi> with him no more, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3. O young
Folks! you may be harden'd before you grow
old; Lust may be strongly rooted before old
Age; and I fear 'tis so with abundance of
Youth: Is it not so with some of you? Did not
some of you blush at a little sin, and now
thou canst mock at great ones! Are there
not some amongst you that once dared not to
tell a small Lye, and now you can lye all
sorts? Are there none here that trembled
when they swore a little Oath, and now can
swear at the bloodiest rate, and add Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
and Cursing to their Oaths! Sirs, did not
some of you feel a check for a light act, and
now you can commit Fornication and Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
without any inward Rebuke! It was
hard to bring thee to pilfer a Peny, and now
thou canst steal Shillings and Pounds: It was
much ado that thou couldst endure to be
drunk in the Night, but now thou canst do it
openly, and glory in it. Thou durst not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
have neglected a Sermon, and thou
must pray by thy self, but now, alas, poor
Creature! thou canst play away a whole Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48747:52"/>
and spend Weeks without Prayer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
one serious Prayer. My Friends, what's
the matter! is sin grown a less evil? by no
means? Is God, and Heaven, and Hell, less
certain! No, no, Sirs, you will feel it to your
Cost: Is thy poor Soul less precious, and less
valuable? No, this is not it neither, but the
reason of it is this; Wickedness is grown by
Wickedness; committing sin has made it easie,
the Current of sin running, has made the
Channel wider, and the opposition less. O,
therefore for the Lords sake, begin this day
to consider, the Devil is grown more impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
by thy Consent: And I can tell thee to
day, and let the youngest of you observe it,
That if thou continuest wicked, thou wilt be
yet more and more so. And thou wouldst
now blush to think what Wickedness thou
wilt hereafter come to: As <hi>Hazael,</hi> when it
was foretold him by the Prophet what Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
he should commit, cries out, <hi>Is thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
a Dog?</hi> 2 King. 8. 13. &amp;c. Thus I have
finished what I intended in the Explication, I
now come to the Use.</p>
            <p>First, by way of Inference; the Lord set it
home. Some own'd great good on this day
twelve-month, may more receive good to day.
The Inferences then are these.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inf.</hi> 1. How dismal a sight doth this Truth
afford us of this World! Childhood and Youth
is Vanity: Ah, Lord! how true then is it,
that even <hi>the whole World lies in Wickedness,</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:48747:52"/>
1 Joh. 5. 19. the greater part doth so; for Young
People are many more than old ones. The
<hi>chief</hi> part of Age is Vanity; the <hi>best</hi> part of
Time is Vanity; Childhood is the time fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
to learn in; Youth is the time fittest to
act in, and yet both these are Vanity. Oh,
how little are heavenly Designs carried on by
Young Ones! Oh, how little is God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipp'd
and serv'd by Young ones! How few
of them are engag'd in their own true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns!
Dreadful! that in Youth we will do
nothing, and in Age we can do nothing! Oh,
who loves God, and is not grieved! who
loves Souls, and is not melted! All men come
sick into the World, and most men grow
more diseased by their stay there. All come mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
and most help on each others Ruine,
and encrease their own. Oh, how many go
off the Stage, and have reason to wish, would
to God I had perish'd before I saw the light!
So like Hell is this present State, that i'ts
a wonder we are able to take any Delight
therein. God is serious with pleople in their
younger Years, and they heed it not: Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
are earnest with young People, and they
regard it not: Ah, poor Wretches! they
think we have nothing to do with them.
Oh, Young Ones! help us to mourn to day, for
I am calling on Men to mourn for you, who
in your Youth yield your selves up to your
Lusts, and thereby are injurious to Christ, and
cruel to your own Souls, and will you be unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:48747:53"/>
               <hi>Inf.</hi> 2. What Care is incumbent on Parents
and Masters, in the managing of Young Persons!
Youth is vain, and that bespeaks a suitable
carriage. O Parents, you don't beget Angels,
but sinful Children; you breed up corrupt
ones, and not perfect ones: Few are sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Womb, and therefore you should
deal with Children as with deprav'd and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Persons, as with them whose Childhood
and Youth is Vanity. The very Distemper
directs Parents and Masters in their duty and
carriage towards their Children: I shall espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
name Parents in my Directions.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Children are Ignorant:</hi> Oh therefore take
you occasion to instruct them. Alas! canst
thou let thy Children be unacquainted with
God, and insensible of their own Misery! or
the way of their escape! What must thy Child
be inspir'd, or it must perish for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?
If it must know, pray who is fittest
to teach it? Upon whom does it lye in point
of Duty, as it does upon you? And who has
the Advantage of doing it as thou hast? Who
is so like to prevail with thy Child as thy
self? None faithfully dedicates his Child to
God in Infancy, that will not carefully instruct
him when of age to learn.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Youth have unruly Appetites,</hi> and therefore
don't indulge them. Oh that every Parent
here had but his Heart open to what I say:
and I speak it out of pity to the Souls of
Young ones. 'Tis an ill practice in Parents to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48747:53"/>
feed their Child by the cravings of i'ts Lust,
and not by their own Judgment. I will tell
you the Mischief of it, besides the laying a
foundation of distemper in Age; it gives the
Appetite an ungovernable force. Children
being alwayes indulg'd in what they crave,
they cannot deny themselves any thing they
desire; and by the same rule, that they must now
eat what and when, and drink what and when
they will, while they are under thy care; they
will be drunk and Whore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when they grow
in years; their Reason cannot bridle it then, as
thine (which ought to guide them) neglects
to do it now. Oh dreadful thing! that any
Childrens Appetites should come from under
their Parents tuition unbridled: I look on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
a greater Reproach to Parents. And
what's the ground of all Wickedness in the
World, more than an Inordinate Appetite? yet
how few Parents do help to cure it while cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able!
whereas an Appetite curbed in Childhood,
would endure a denial in Age.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Youth have violent Humours, and Selfishness,</hi>
and therefore don't foolishly gratifie them.
<hi>A Child left to himself, brings his Mother to shame.</hi>
Pr. 29. 15. Oh what a Devilish Sight! how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to Satan! to see Children cocquer'd, and
Youth indulg'd! It's peevish, then all must be
done to please it; it's obstinate, and it must
have it's will; it's revengeful, and it must
not be check'd; this is the way of most Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
And 'tis just with God that Child should
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48747:54"/>
break your Hearts, whose Will you never broke.
How many poor Creatures will have cause in
Hell to curse their Parents! Dreadful! that
they prove the worst Enemies to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
under a pretence of fondness.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Youth have many Lusts, and are prone to sin,</hi>
therefore be afraid for them, and prevent all
Occasions. <hi>Iob</hi> knew this, <hi>Iob 1. 5. He went
and offer'd Sacrifice, lest his Children should have
sin'd, and cursed God in their hearts.</hi> Oh that
Parents would consider what brittle Vessels
Children be! what dry'd tinder Youth is: Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
though small, over-rule Young Persons:
What then? Oh then be perswaded to choose
the Company of your Children for them, see
that it be of their own Sex, and Virtuous.
Put them to Trades, and such Trades as have
the least Snares; set them in Families where
most Good is to be got, and least evil to be
catch'd. Find them business, and fulness of
Employ, and cut out their time for them. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
learn this Wisdom, that your Children
have no time for Idleness. Marry them as
soon as convenient, if so be you are not very
certain of their Sobriety.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>The Vanity of Youth is deeply rooted;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be importunate pleaders, and sharp Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors.
If advice prevail not; 'tis not an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
thing to cure a Child of it's Vanity, or
Youth of it's Folly. <hi>Foolishness is bound up in
the heart of a Child, the Rod of Correction will
drive it far from him,</hi> Prov. 22. 15. <hi>And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48747:54"/>
not correction from thy Child, and he shall not
dye,</hi> Prov. 23. 13. I look on't as a sad sign of
growing Villany in the next Age, that corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is become unfashonable: The Lord pity
us. Let me tell you once for all, Sirs, Youth
is governed chiefly by fear, and they that
lose the benefit of that passion, lose the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
advantage which Youth have to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd
or improv'd by. People may talk of
love, but God's injoining the Rod so oft, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
that it will prevail but with very few.
Wisdom must be exercised in this matter, as
the end may be best attained: But be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the Blood of that Child lyes at the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
door, who might have been reform'd
by Corrections, and was not. Can Parents for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
God's severe Judgment against <hi>Eli</hi> for his
indulgence to his Sons? or do you think that
Children are now so harmless, that they need
not to be corrected? I should have call'd you
to give them good Examples, as being pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
to encline them, who strictly observe,
and are prone to imitate you; they are apter
to evil than good; deny them no help to
their holy improvements, and create them no
hinderances: But time prevents me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inf.</hi> 3. How should Young Ones bear the
Rebukes and Restraints of Superiours in sence
of their own Vanity! Here I call to Young
Ones again: Parents and Masters know what
will harm you better than you do your selves;
they know how weak you are to resist Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48747:55"/>
they know what's sinful and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
better than you. Oh therefore thank
God, and thank them that are over you, who
endeavour your healing, and <hi>don't suffer sin to
lye upon you;</hi> Lev. 19. 17. If you be good your
selves, you'l do the same for your Children
when you have them; therefore don't take
that ill which is your necessary cure; but rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon,
Am I vain! Oh then! though I have not
the Liberty I would, and have not the Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
I desire, matters are better order'd for
me, for I can't bear those other things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inf.</hi> 4. How Attentive ought you to be to
all Advices and Pleadings of your Relations,
being design'd to heal you! O! for thy Souls
sake, Young One, never let the Advice of thy
Parents be lost; never let thy Friends Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
and Reproof be lost, because 'tis all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to remove this Disease: Thou dost not
see the Hell thou art just running into; thou
dost not see the Heaven thou art flying from;
thou dost not see the God thou hast provok't;
thou dost not know the Misery thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
thou art ignorant what Grace, what
Wisdom thou wantest; how much must thou
learn and attain before thou art wise, or good;
thou art ignorant of many snares, and sins;
thy folly hides thy folly from thee. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore!
be heartily intent to all their Advices, and
say to thy self, Lord, is this for my cure,
and shall I neglect it? Is this Reproof for my
good, and shall I make light of it? Is all this
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48747:55"/>
pains to heal my poor diseas'd Soul, and shall I
cast it behind my back? God forbid!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inf.</hi> 5. How great a Wonder of Grace is a
young Convert! and how thankfully should
such acknowledge it! O the power that makes
the vain Prodigal <hi>come to himself!</hi> Luk. 15. 17.
How near does God come to the Soul, to tame
it, when 'tis like a wild Asses Colt! How ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious
is Grace, that overcomes Lust in it's
greatest rage! and that deadens Temptations
when they strike on Youth, so prone to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
the offer, and yield to it! O Blessed work!
that inclines us to fear that God whom in our
Youth, we are so apt to despise.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Having laid these things before you,</hi> I offer
two General Vses of Exhortation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exh.</hi> 1. Reflect on your selves, whether you
are under this Vanity, or deliver'd from it.
Young Folks, I speak mostly to you, and
therefore I intreat you for the Lords sake to
lay to heart what I am saying. Your case is
dismal, you are born vain, and prone to be
vain; are you still so or not? 'Tis a great
work that goes to the healing you; is that
work pass'd on thee? 'Tis a great deal of God
goes to the making a Youth good, and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
have I felt that? Pray ask your selves,
Am I vain, or am I not? Is my Heart a Spring
of Divine Motions, or Beastly Inclinations?
Young People, how is it with you? <hi>Try your
mayes,</hi> are they under the Government of
Grace or of Lust? are they under the Conduct
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48747:56"/>
of Wisdom or Folly? Ask your selves, Do my
wayes profit or hurt People? Is it not time to
ask? What Sirs! are the years you have spent
unfit to be enquired after? or is thy Sin not
worth being concerned about? Oh ask your
selves often, What am I doing? whither am
I going? Does my walk please God, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
him? Do I walk with him, or do I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
him? Try and judge impartially; it's thy
greatest concern; thou mayest deceive thy self,
thou canst not delude thy God, who will judge
as the matter truly stands with thee. How is
it with you, O Young ones? There's none
here but ought to be concern'd how 'tis with
them. You will be concern'd, nay within a
while you must be concern'd: therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
this to day, and never rest till it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exh.</hi> 2. Receive Directions suitable to your
case: And here I must divide this whole As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
into two parts: First, <hi>Such as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the power of Vanity.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Such as are by
Grace delivered from it.</hi> One of these two is every
one in this Assembly; Young and Old you are
still under the power of Vanity, or you are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from it: There is a great difference in your
Case, I'll speak to each. 1. Those of you that
are yet under the power of this Vanity. Poor
Souls! would you be delivered? or have you
a mind to continue what you are? Come Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
dare you be still blind! and still obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate?
shall thy Soul that was made for God,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48747:56"/>
be a Cage of unclean Birds? Shall thy Tongue
which is his Glory, be employed to his Dsho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?
O Young body! shall not Christ heal
thee of that Nature, which the Devil intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced?
Wilt thou live a Bruit and a Devil
still? shall Satan serve himself of thy parts,
and of thy strength, and of thy opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
shall the Devil say of thee, Here's a Child,
I hope, will do me a great deal of Drudgery?
Here's a young Person will do my Work while
he lives, and be damned with me when he
dies? Young Folks, Satan stands by, and seems
to speak thus of you: And must Christ all
this while weep over thee, and say, Here's a
young thing that's my Creature, but he will
rebell against me as long as I spare him? here's
a Youth fit to serve me, but he will bring on
me all the Dishonour that he can, and obstruct
my Interests as far as he is able: Here's a Strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
that I bought with my Blood, a young
Girl or Boy, but he serves Satan before me, and
will not be saved, unless against his Will?
For the Lords sake lay these things to heart to
day! What say you, Child, to this? what say
you Young People? I hope some of you will
be ready to answer, O Sir, help me, give me
some counsel, for I am weary of this present
Condition, and would be in a better; if so,
take these few Advices, and resolve to follow
them in earnest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:48747:57"/>
1. Believe how had thou art by nature, and
bewail it before God. Oh, 'tis thy Picture
I have been drawing, as bad as it is! Come
poor young Folks, you that pride your selves
when you look in the Glass, could you but
see your Souls with a right Eye, you would
abhor your selves: Young People, will you
believe God speaking of you? Does not he
say you are vain and vile? will you believe all
the wise People that know you? and will they
not all agree in this, That thou art a sinful
wretched Creature? Doth not thy own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
convince thee? Oh Friend! own it, and
go away mourning; and how canst thou but
do so, when thon consider'st, My Heart is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
my Affections disorder'd, the powers of
my Soul poor and wounded, the Image of
God lost, Satan's nature is visible upon me;
what a Reproach doth every title fasten!
what can be said worse of thee, than that
thou art thus? Is this a Case to be rested in?
is this a state to be quiet in? yet this is thy
Case, O young Person, by Nature! thou art
full of what's hateful to God, and hurtful to
others; thou art intent on thy own Ruine. Oh,
Sirs, the most innocent young Sinner here, is
fuller of Poison than a Toad, and filthier than
a Swine: All of you are thus by Nature, and
yet thou remainest so.</p>
            <p>2. Consider often how miserable thou art,
whilst thou continuest thus vain. Danger will
affright some, whom Sin will not. But, O
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48747:57"/>
how unable am I to represent the Horror of this
to you! Young People! you <hi>are Children of
wrath as well as others,</hi> Eph. 2. 3. Every Lust
is a killing Wound, every step is on the brink
of Hell; there's not a wicked Child in this
Congregation, but I can stand over it, and say,
Here's a Child with whom God's angry every
day; here's a young Body, <hi>for whom God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
his wrath,</hi> Nah. 1. 2. and sees his time a
coming. Young People! sure you will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to go home, and say, I am a Sinner, and I
am an impenitent Sinner, and therefore an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardon'd
Sinner; a Sinner for whom everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Wrath is reserved. Once for all, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to be wicked, and God cannot but be
just: You will not be <hi>born again,</hi> and God must
keep you out of his Kingdom then, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 3.
You <hi>will live after the flesh,</hi> ay, and God is as
resolved <hi>you shall die in your sins,</hi> Rom. 8. 13.
Come, Young People, God will be as perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory
as you, and his Will shall stand; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tremble to go out of this Congregation,
unless in a founder Mind than you came.</p>
            <p>3. Be convinc'd that nothing short of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
Grace can savingly heal thee. Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
may polish thee; Fear and Shame may
restrain and conceal a Sinner, but 'tis only
Grace can truly alter a Sinner. O, my Friends!
it must be <hi>a new Heart,</hi> or it will always be a
vain Heart. Vain Inclinations will govern, till
God <hi>writes his Law there,</hi> Heb. 8. 10. The
youngest must be <hi>a new Creature,</hi> or natural
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48747:58"/>
Corruption will baffle all pretensions, <hi>Gal.
6.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>4. Be assur'd, Grace cannot be had but from
God, through Christ, by the Operations of
his Spirit. Don't think it an easie thing to
attain Grace, tho it be necessary to have it.
Young Folks, God must open his Treasures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new,
or thou wilt for ever want it. Christ
must plead for thee, or thy Disease is incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
he must act towards thee, as Redeemer,
and not meerly as Creator, unless he pass by
thee as one rejected. He <hi>seeks the lost sheep,</hi>
Mat. 18. 12. he makes the stubborn willing;
Faith is his Gift, Consent is his Purchase, as
well as the Blessings annex'd to it; <hi>there is no
other Name by which we can be saved,</hi> Act. 4. 12.
there is no other Fountain of Grace or Help.
Know also, it's the Spirit must give of Christ's
fulness, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 14. he must enlighten thee, O
Child, or thou wilt go blind to thy Grave;
he must renew thee, or thou wilt die in thy
Uncleanness. Christ made the Atonement,
but the Spirit makes us capable of its Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Christ hath acquired a fulness of Grace
and Blessings; it's by the Spirit he imparts
thereof to Man. Men cannot renew thee, means
of themselves are too weak to alter thee. Oh,
then look upwards! wait on God; direct thy
Eye to Christ, depend on the Holy Spirit,
as able to conquer thy Reluctancy, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to work by the means to which his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
is promised.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:48747:58"/>
5. Observe, that the more thou sinnest, and
the longer thou art graceless, the more oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
thou layest in the way of Grace: think
serioully of this; the hopes of the Soul are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Spirit's working, and the disposedness
of the Heart to yield unto them. Oh, my
Friends! will you go on in sin? then the Spirit
of God will leave you, he will not <hi>always
strive,</hi> Gen. 6. 3. The more you sin, the more
you quench the Spirit. Will you go on in sin?
then your Heart will be <hi>hardned</hi> the more, <hi>Heb.
3.</hi> 8. Wilt thou go on delaying? then to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
it will be harder to prevail with thee than
to day. Oh, therefore be allarm'd to day.
More sin will strengthen your Lusts, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
prejudice your Soul against Christ. Is not
Conversion difficult enough already? is there
need to make it next to impossible? for the
Lords sake consider! greater Offences may
make God and Men say of thee, This Wretch
is resolved against Grace, he arms himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Hope.</p>
            <p>6. Resolve within thy self, that thou wilt
follow after Christ, and throw off thy Vanity
without delay. Oh, that I could but get this
Consent from you all this day! That all the
young People in this Congregation would say,
O Lord, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi> Come, poor Sinners!
put it to your selves this moment: Say, For
this I will pray, that I may cease to be vain;
I will meditate for this, I will hear for this.
O young Folks, that are yet in a state of sin,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48747:59"/>
you have work enough for your time! sometimes
you know not how to pass away your time: what,
spiritually blind, and not know how to pass away
time! what, dead and graceless, and not know
how to pass away time! a Sinner wild in his
frame, and have no Work! Oh, be intreated
this day to be earnest with God, and never be
quiet till he has given thee Wisdom instead of
Folly; till he has given thee Sobriety instead
of Rashness; Humility instead of Conceit;
Calmness instead of Passion; Truth instead of
Falshood: Yea, never be satisfied till God has
brought thee to live to the best and highest pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses.
And, oh, that every Soul would say
<hi>Amen;</hi> how would Satan be disappointed!
how would Heaven rejoyce! it would be thy
best day, and the entrance of eternal Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But I believe some here are ready to say,
Sir, must I now change? must I now stop my
Vanity? surely 'tis too soon: Sure I might be vain
a little longer; there's no danger in it, I hope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> My Address to you is, for this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
even <hi>to day harden not your Hearts,</hi> Heb.
4. 7. Oh Child! just now cease to be vain; 'tis
late enough with the youngest of you; it's
not too soon to stop a wicked Course, now,
now thou shouldst yield to Christ: If you ask,
Why now? I tell you:</p>
            <p>1. Because young Peoples Souls shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
or damned by the same Rules as the old
ones, if they be past Infancy. Oh, if you
die to night, God will judge you by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel!
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48747:59"/>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 16. and that's the lowest Rule God
can judge you by: <hi>Youth</hi> must be judged as well
as Men, <hi>Eccl. 11. 10. Young ones</hi> that obey not
the Gospel, shall not escape the Vengeance,
2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>2. God is concerned at, and provok'd by the
Vanity of Children: Pray consider, you think,
it may be, that God takes no more notice of
what you say or do, than you do your selves.
Alas! you are deceived: don't you think God
was angry with the Children whom he slew by
the Bears, for deriding the Prophet? 2 <hi>King.</hi>
2. 24. God notes what you do: Young Ones,
God doth not rule old Men, and leave Children
to their own Wills; his Laws are prescribed
to young Men under the same Threats, as to
the old; and it's not indifferent to him what
you do: God observes what you do as much as
any other person; for you are his Subjects, you
were made for his Glory: you serve him, or
his Enemy the Devil, and what you do is good
or evil.</p>
            <p>3. The youngest of you are under Vows to
God against Vanity; I suppose you were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into Gods Covenant by your Parents, as
<hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 11, 12. Was not a holy Heart, and a
serious godly Life engaged in that Covenant,
in opposition to Sin and Satan? You are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to God in your Infancy; you are his,
and not your own. Young Children! what,
will you lie to God now? will you be perjur'd
now? O, God forbid! Dare any young Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48747:60"/>
here say, I was given to God in my Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
but I now retract it; I was sworn to be the
Lords, but I will not keep to him: Baptism
will sink those Children of Believers, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
not their Vows, and practically renounce
their God.</p>
            <p>4. Let me tell you, if you remain vile all
your Youth, a thousand to one but you will be
ever so: You may die before you are old, and
then you are undone; but if you live, and are
not converted when young, it's improbable
that ever you should. O, it's ill dealing with
old Sinners, they are conceited, full of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
immersed in worldly Cares; the Calls
and Threatnings of God, are grown familiar
to them, and their Souls stupid and void of
Affections. God makes now and then an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Grace in them, but 'tis rare; the last
Hour Converts are next to Miracles; most
feel that, <hi>he that hardens his heart, being often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
shall die without Remedy,</hi> Prov. 29. 1.</p>
            <p>5. Again; Oh, what service mayst thou do
for God, when thou ceasest to be vain betimes!
Come, my Friends, what a heap will every
days little come to in time! if Young persons
would but now begin to be holy, tho they act
but a little for God every day, it will at length
amount to much: As we say, he that begins
with the Sun, will make a long days Journey.
Oh, how much do Young People do for the
Devil, in a state of sin, when they live long!
how large is the Roll of their Transgressions!
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48747:60"/>
and how much might they do for God in a
state of Grace! how many may bless God for
thee! what a publick blessing mayst thou
prove! thou mayst well be an eminent Saint,
much improved for Heaven, and abundant in
the fruits of Righteousness.</p>
            <p>6. Our Youth will be the Plague or Hope
of this Land in this great <hi>Crysis.</hi> Great things
are before us, the rapid motion of Providence
hints no common matters: There have of late
been many ways taken to debauch Young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in their Manners, to prejudice them against
Holiness and Sobriety. Nevertheless the holy
God has seasoned some Young Ones; there are
many looking Heaven-ward, and God seems
designed to reform the rest. Well, whether
of these two prevail, doth determine <hi>England</hi>'s
lot. Oh, if our Youth grow yet more profligate,
God's about to leave us! if he recover our
Youth, we may hope he'll yet continue amongst
us. Young Ones, I would be earnest with
you, for God indicates his mind to <hi>England</hi> by
you. Oh, be you all ready to say, Can I
help to save a Nation! by the Grace of God I
will be one of these that will do it; let Satan,
and the World, and the Flesh struggle with
me as they can.</p>
            <p>7. This youthful Vanity continued in, will
be the grief, and wounding of Age, tho thou
shouldst be converted then. Little do you now
know what youthful sins may cost you in old
Age: <hi>Thou makest me to possess the sins of my
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48747:61"/>
youth,</hi> sayes <hi>Iob,</hi> ch. 13. 16. Oh, how bitter
will the remembrance of past Villanies be! oh,
how wilt thou tremble to think thou hast
help'd any one in the way to Hell, when
thou thy self art got out of that road!
How will it grieve thee to think thou hast
been a means to damn any Soul! can it be a
little thing to thee? the Joy of late Converts
is abated by the thoughts of youthful Sins.
<hi>Paul</hi> carry'd it to the Grave with him, that he
was a Persecutor in his Youth. Believe me, Sirs,
the Evidence of our Conversion, when late, is
more than made up by the Innocency of our
Lives, when converted young: And they are
to blame, who seem to complain that gross
Villanies have not made their Change more
remarkable. Thus I have done with the first
<hi>Vse;</hi> God grant it be to such purpose, that
none may go out of this place unwearied and
unresolved; unwearied with his Vanity, and
unresolved to put an end to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exhort.</hi> 2. To such as through Grace are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from this Vanity.</p>
            <p>Before I enter on this, I must declare you
are our Joy, and our Crown; I would I could
speak it of every one here to day: Oh, that
every Young One in this place, were of this
Number! You are our Comfort, that God has
some to propagate Religion when we are dead
and gone. How lovely is Gods Image in
your tender Years! Your Grace is less que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable
now than it would be, if you were
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48747:61"/>
aged. I say your Conversion's more evident
now; for you are now in your Health and
Heat; you are now under the force of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation;
you are not decripid, and aged, and
under the government of Fear, as old Folks
be. Oh, my Friends! what but Grace can
win thy Consent to Christ, now when the
Devil and the World are strongly bidding
for it? You are like to reap the largest Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,
because you have the longest Seed-time.
You young ones that do fear the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
you are like to be the more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in the Heavens. All the Blessings that
belong to the oldest Saint, belong to you;
and Christ as truly loves you: The youngest
Believer in this place may rejoyce in all the
fulness of Christ, as his Store-house and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity;
he may read over all the greatest
Promises of the Gospel with Comfort, as his
own. We bless God for you, bless God for
your selves, that hath adopted you for his so
soon, and thereby prevented much Sin, and
made you early Blessings: for your sake we
hope the Gospel will not be removed from
<hi>England;</hi> how happy are each of you! your
Parents can die comfortably now that you
are in Christ: Your Friends look with joy
upon you, as secure in your better part. Oh
the comfortable Aspect that every such Soul
affords! I will give you a few words of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <div type="directions">
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:48747:62"/>
               <head>Directions to such as are Converted in Youth.</head>
               <p>1. Be watchful over your selves, because
some Vanity remains in the best, while here.
Satan would more gladly overcome you than
others; and he knows there's matter for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
to work on in thee. Youthful years
are subject to <hi>youthful Lusts:</hi> Young <hi>Timothy</hi>
himself was warned of them by wise <hi>Paul,
2 Tim.</hi> 2. 22. Therefore don't venture on
Occasions of Vanity; don't venture into tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
to sin: Nothing but perfect Grace
perfectly heals the Sin of your Constitution.
Young ones, you don't think you are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect!
you are not thoroughly clean, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
walk carefully, walk watchfully; take
care of Voluptuousness, for there is some
unruliness in thy Appetite still. Take care of
wanton Dalliance, for there is some Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to Uncleanness, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 2. Still
take care of evil Company; Youth may be
ensnared, tho they are good: Avoid all fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Society, for Youth is apt to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to loss of Time and Levity: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
walk with watchfulness in whatever you
are doing: You are not in Heaven, tho in a
State of Grace; you are not perfect, tho up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right;
therefore keep a jealous Eye while your
green years continue.</p>
               <p>2. Keep humble and modest as to your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
for Truth admits the Disquisitions of
Age and a long Study. Young People think
every Notion they have gotten is infallible,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48747:62"/>
and every plausible Reason is with them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable.
But let me tell you, you will
change your judgments it may be before you
dye: And too much confidence in Youth leads
a Man to Scepticism in Age; <hi>Be not wise in your
own conceits,</hi> Prov. 3. 7. You are subject to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
in deep things your knowledge can be
but superficial; if you live long you will blush
at your present confidence: And therefore
don't presently take up Notions; determine
not hastily difficult points, make no noise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
singular Opinions, and do not rashly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
men that are wise and aged, whose deep
thoughts are preferrable to a voluble Tongue,
or luxuriant Fancy.</p>
               <p>3. Design and furnish your selves for great
service for God in the World. I would ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
bespeak a mercy for the next Age; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
an eminency in Holiness: I would have
every young Convert here, resolve to be one
of the highest Saints: Resolve to do much for
God's Name and Gospel; and if you have
hopeful Abilities, resolve to be great Blessings
to your Countrey: Side with the best Cause,
and best Men. You may live to have greater
Opportunities to serve God than we have had:
you may do so, and I hope you will do so.
The Lord furnish our Youth with Abilities
transcendant to ours, as their work is like to
be above ours. O my Friends, I would have
you therefore prepare your selves; get your
Heads well enlightened, get your Hearts well
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48747:63"/>
enflam'd with Love to God and Men. Labour
to be industrious in your Calling, that you
may have Estates to do good withal; for Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and waste make Persons too poor to do
great Service; whence they live as Shrubs
though planted young. Study good Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisms,
as a guard against Errors. Lay up
rules of Prudence for your Conversation, but
beware of crastiness and little base designs.
Observe your Constitution, that sickliness may
not prevent your Use. Get such an Elocuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as may advantage what you speak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Admit the helps, and put your selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all the instituted Engagements of Christs
Members. Admit the helps,—Sirs, we have
good Books, carefully peruse them. Read the
Scriptures: Ay, and labour to be well furnisht,
and skilld in them from your Youth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
3. 15. Set your selves to hear Sermons; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
put your selves under the Labours
and Conduct of the best Ministers. Contrive
every one of you to sit under that Ministry;
that truly understands, and plainly and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully
urges the great things of the Gospel,
<hi>viz.</hi> The Mysteries, Promises, and Laws of
our Redeemer. I tell you why I say this;
Young ones are apt to like the Preacher that
has Fancy rather then Weight; strong Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
rather than Judgment; that has vain
Gingles rather than solid Truth; and that is
earnest for small matters above essentials: Oh
take it from me to Day, all Hearers savour of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48747:63"/>
their Pastor: Give me therefore a Pastor that's
likest to ripen for a Heavenly Life, and not
to amuse me with little fine-spun Notions,
where light carries not it's Evidence. Preferr
moderate Pastors above others; Men who are
more intent on the great things of the Gospel,
than lesser matters: Men who allow for diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Conceptions in others, knowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are imperfect: Men who insist on no
terms of, or bars to Communion, but what
Christ hath made. If God do not deliver the
growing Age from a Contentious, Dividing,
Uncharitable Temper, I shall say the next
fiery struggles will hazard the Life of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and sacrifice Love (the very Heart of
Religion) to every trifle, and disputable No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which hath sorely wounded us. Value
Moderate Men, wise Men are always such.
Your furious dividing Bigott is unacquainted
with himself, incapable of taking up the body
of Divine Truths, as they stand in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and place. Hence one thing fills his mind,
and that commonly the least, and all his Zeal
is laid out in that, while he confounds Truth
and Error. Few Men have heads clear enough
to distinguish Truth; Truth and Error lye
oft so near, that the Man that has not the
clearest judgment, and the conduct of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
will easily fail; much more such whose
parts are low, and whose uncharitable Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
exclude the assistances of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Further, I call you Young ones to attend
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48747:64"/>
to the Lords Supper. You are dedicated to
God by Baptism, in the right of your Parents;
that was not thy act, but theirs for thee; that
was not in thy own right, but in thy Parents
right. The first solemnizing of thy own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
is at the Lords Table, or in order to
it; therefore I call you to make Conscience
of that. Young People, I say make consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of it. I tremble to think how we differ
from the Church in former Ages; that People
now should be so backward to attend the
Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But some may object, Pray how old
must we be that come to the Table of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, He is old enough that can
give evidence of his consent to be the Lords,
and when he can act the Graces that belong
to a Sacrament, and improve the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
therein, whenever they can do this, age
is no obstacle. I would not scruple one of
fourteen no more than I would one of fifty,
where there's a credible Profession of Grace,
and a competent knowledge of the great Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials
of Religion, and a Conversation suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to it: Therefore, my Friends, make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of this great Duty; for I am afraid
our young Professors remain giddy, for want
of this and of Pastoral Conduct. I fear you
want strength for want of this, and comfort
for want of this; and Satan has great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
against our young Professors, because
they are not more established and steady than
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48747:64"/>
they be. Therefore if thon hast given up thy
self to be the Lords; and if God has enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd
thy Mind to understand the great things
of the Covenant, thou hast a claim, and thou
oughtest to make it; sure thou art old enough
to consent to be Christs, when thou art fit to
give thy self in Marriage.</p>
               <p>5. Dispose of your selves to the greatest
Safety, and most Usefulness. You that
are Servants, chuse no Family where God
is not worship'd, for a curse and a snare is
there; besides the want of those daily helps
which you stand in need of. You that are
changing your dwellings, go to no place where
the Gospel is not, live not in a Countrey
where Christ is a Stranger as to his Institutions.
You young ones that are about Marrying! be
sure that Grace be the first thing that you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 39. for God kuows how
much easier it is to stifle good beginnings, than
to conquer riveted custom; and it's much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
to be overcome by a bad Wife, than a bad
Wife to be converted by a good Husband.
Know this my Friends, he that does not wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contrive for his Soul as a Man in Danger,
will rue it sooner or later. God is not bound
to help us when we run out of his way.</p>
               <p>6. Reckon upon a world of Troubles, and
Snares, and be still preparing for them. Oh
young People, be every day arming your
selves, for you may be every day attacqued;
don't promise too serene a State on this side
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48747:65"/>
Heaven, <hi>In the world you shall have trouble,</hi> John
16. 33. Thy Work is a Warfare, and holds
for Life; temptations will assault, disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and scandals will try; the best Men
may be a stumbling-block: Be fit for every
thing, and resolved to hold on thy way; it's
hard work, but Christ hath undertaken to
assist thee, and Heaven is worth thy labour.
Oh don't think and act as if you were to have
your resting place here, where Satan hath so
much power, and Sin so great an interest.</p>
               <p>7. Still grow in Grace, and usefulness with
age. Though thou art good for thy time,
thou art not so good as thou mayst be, nor
oughtest to be, much less so good as you should
resolve to be: Oh let not age's dulness be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
by the vigour of your <hi>espousals,</hi> Jer. 2. 2.
Take care that time adds to thy Light, to
thy Love, to thy strength and Fruit. Move
Heaven-ward as days are prolonged.</p>
               <p>8. Familiarize the Word as your Instructor
and Monitor. Which <hi>way should a Young Man
cleanse his way, but by taking heed to the Word?</hi>
Psal. 119. 9. Let the Word be the Man of thy
Councel; take the Scripture for thy Rule,
and resolve to live by it. Oh Servants, look what
God makes your Duty in Scripture, will that
allow you to be idle, insolent, or wastefull? <hi>Col.
3.</hi> 22. Children, see what God makes your
Duty to your Parents, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 1. and to your
other Relations; may you be rebellious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<hi>&amp;c?</hi> the Word is the true measure and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48747:65"/>
light: Alas! the oldest of us are sure to stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
without the Word; what then can young
ones do? Therefore study the Scriptures more,
search them, and labour in every thing to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
your selves by them. Sirs, I would have
no one here ignorant of a rule proper to most
of the Exigences of his Life, and let that be
still before thy eyes. I will give you Young
People one Advice, that may do you good all
your dayes, and that's this: I would have
you all consider what Temptations you are
like to meet with, and what are the Duties
you are like to be call'd to; alwayes have an
apt Scripture lodg'd in thy Mind, suitable to
each of these; and resolve to do nothing,
nor to purpose nothing before thou hast
first consulted that Scripture in thy Mind;
this would be a stated way of avoiding much
sin. Young people! you that are in Christ,
labour to live to these Rules. I shall now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude:
I have been plainly telling all of you,
Childhood and Youth is Vanity. You all
come such into the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
or are you not? do you still grow
more vain, or more serious? should God come
this day, and divide this Assembly, and set
the Vain on the right hand, and the Serious
on the left; O Child, O Young Man, on which
side wouldst thou be found?</p>
               <p>O put it to your selves; what answer canst
thou return? wilt thou go away and resolve
to be as Vain as ever, after all that has been
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48747:66"/>
said? If that be thy resolve, would to God
thou hadst not been here; this Sermon will
be a Thorn in thy side for ever: But if from
what has been said, you go away resolving
through Grace to be faithful in the practice
of all these Directions, given you for the
Cure of your Vanity: If so, then thou wilt
have cause for ever to bless God for the <hi>25th.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No: <hi>Adam</hi> sinned against God, and
thereby he corrupted the Humane Nature, and
became subject to all the Misery which the Law
threatned against sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What Condition wert thou born in?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I was born in a very miserable and sinful
Condition, <hi>Eph. 2. 3. Ps.</hi> 51. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How camest thou to be born in this Condition?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I must be miserable, if sinful, and I could
not but be born sinful, because my Nature
was depraved in <hi>Adam,</hi> from whom it descends
so to me by the Line of my Forefathers, <hi>Iob
14.</hi> 4. &amp; 25. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Why must thou be sinful, because thy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was at first depraved?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> God enacted this as the Law of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that <hi>Adam</hi> should beget his Children in
natural likeness, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
            <p>Q. What if thou shouldst die in that Condition
wherein thou wert born by nature?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:48747:67"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> I should be undone, and be with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
in Hell for ever, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 5, 36.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Doth the Law of Innocency provide no way
for thy deliverance out of that misery?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Law of Innocency provides no way
for my Deliverance out of this Misery, as
great and dreadful as it is, <hi>Rom. 3. 19, 20.
Gal.</hi> 3. 21, 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Why dost thou think so?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Because the Law of Innocency admits
no pardon, but condemns for one sin; and I
daily find that I have many sins, <hi>Rom. 3. 23.
Iam.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is there no way then for to avoid that Sin and
Misery thou wert born in?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes: there is, by the rich mercy of God,
a way to save lost Sinners, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 15. Act.</hi>
16, 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is the way which God hath contrived
to save lost Sinners?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The way of Pardon and Reconciliation
revealed in the Gospel, <hi>Rom. 4. 7. 2. Tim.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How did God appoint a way of Pardon and
Reconciliation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Father appointed his Son to be the
Saviour of Sinners, and Christ accepted of that
Work under certain terms agreed on between
them both, <hi>Zech. 6. 13. Ioh.</hi> 17. 3, 20, 21, 25.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What was appointed to, and undertaken by
Christ as Saviour or Mediator?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Christ was to assume our Nature, and
therein to fulfil all Righteousness, and die a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48747:68"/>
Sacrifice for our Sins, and to save all the Elect
committed to him, <hi>Is. 53. 5. Ioh.</hi> 10. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What was promised to Christ, as the Reward
of his Vndertaking?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There was promised to Christ, besides
the Glory of his Person, as God-Man, that his
Obedience and Sufferings should be accepted
as an effectual Price for the Reconciliation of
all such Sinners to whom it was applied, <hi>Is.</hi>
53. 10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Was there nothing else promised to Christ,
with respect to the Elect?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> All the absolute Promises of Grace in
order to the Application of his Blood, were
made to Christ, <hi>Gal. 3. 16. 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Did our Lord Iesus fulfil all Righteousness,
and make his Soul an Offering for sin?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He did, and thereby honoured the Law,
and vindicated the Government of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
notwithstanding his gracious dealings with
Sinners, <hi>Matth. 3. 15. Ioh. 19. 30. Is. 42. 21.
Heb.</hi> 9. 14, 28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> When Christ had thus made atonement,
was he sufficient to be a Saviour?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes: for 1. He hath the Spirit, and a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Grace, with a right to give thereof to
men. 2. All Judgment is committed to him,
whereby he is the Lawgiver to a sinful World.
3. By the fulness of his Merits he hath Pardon,
Peace, and eternal Life to dispose of, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
we had forfeited all into the hands
of our Creator, <hi>Ioh. 16. 14. Ioh. 1. 15. Ioh. 5.

               <hi>Q.</hi> What more is necessary to restore the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of lost Man?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Application of the Effects of Christs

pardoned and saved, <hi>Rom. 5. 11. Act.
2.</hi> 38.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What way doth Christ take to apply his merits
for the Salvation of Sinners?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He enacteth and publisheth a Law of
Grace, wherein he promiseth Pardon and Life
to such sinners as will accept of him as a Saviour
on the terms of the Gospel, <hi>Heb. 11. 6. Ioh.
3. 16, 17, 18. Rom.</hi> 3. 27.</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> What are the terms of the Gospel?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> True Repentance, Faith in Christ, and
sincere Obedience, <hi>Act. 3. 19. Act. 16. 31. &amp;
Ch. 20. 21. Heb.</hi> 5. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is Repentance?</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Such a sight of things revealed in the
Word, as powerfully affects the Heart sutably
to the nature of them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is Faith in Christ?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Such a sight of, and regard to Christ,
as causeth the humbled Soul to accept of, and
come to him as our Prophet, Priest, and King,
<hi>Iohn 1. 12. Mat.</hi> 11. 28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is it to come to Christ as a Prophet?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> To yield up our selves to his teachings,
believing him infallible, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 68, 69.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Under a Conviction of our guilt and
the fulness of his Merits to rely on him, as the

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is it to come to Chrlst as King?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> To acknowledge his sole authority, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

            <p>
               <hi>Q</hi> What else doth the Gospel contain?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It contains a Prophetick Account of what
God decreed, and a transcript of what was
promised to Christ, with respect to the Elect,
to say nothing of Doctrinal Mysteries, Rules
of a Christians walk, conditional Promises,
the danger of Sinners that reject Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> When did this Gospel Rule of Life begin?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In the first promise to <hi>Adam</hi> after his
Fall, though the fullest discoveries of it were
reserved till Christ came in the Flesh, <hi>Gen. 3.
15. Gal. 3. 8. 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Did God ever since the Fall propose any way
of Salvation, besides this Law of Grace?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No. And every saved Sinner was saved by
this Rule, according to the measure of its disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

Gospel concerned in it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Life through Christ is freely offered sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
to every Sinner that will repent, and

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I shall be more miserable than if Christ

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is the meer enacting and publishing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
all that Christ hath done towards the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Merits to Elect Sinners?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Besides that, he hath appointed his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to encline, and effectually enable them to
obey those terms which the Gospel requireth,
1 <hi>Thes. 1. 4, 5, 6. 1 Cor. 2. 10. Gal.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> And doth the Spirit thus concurr to apply Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
and enable them to obey the Gospel?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, and not only strive with them, as

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> By what means doth this Spirit work upon
Souls?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Principally and most usually he works
by the Gospel it's self, putting forth his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
thereby, as a seed of Life, <hi>Gal. 3. 2. Iam.
1. 18. Rom.</hi> 10. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> By what part of the Gospel doth the Spirit
usually work?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He is confined to no part; he works by
the Precepts, by the account of Christs Death,
by the Promises, Threats, or the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
yet which ever of these he works by,
it is pursuant to, and in accomplishment of
the absolute Promises of Grace which were
made to Christ, <hi>Act. 16. 30, 31. Gal. 3. 29. Gal.

               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:48747:70"/>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How dost thou expect to be made willing and
able to accept of Christ?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Not by any natural power of my own,
who am dead in sin; but by the Grace of Christ
expressing it self in the operations of the Spirit,
<hi>Eph. 2. 1. Acts 5. 31. Tit.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How doth the Spirit cause the Sinner to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of Christ?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> By enlightening the Mind, and changing
the Heart in Regeneration; whence there is
an Inclination, Will, and Ability to accept of
Christ, <hi>Acts 26. 18. Tit.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Doth the Spirit nothing in order to the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Soul earnest and willing to this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He awakens the Soul to a concern for
Salvation, and a deep sence of its present mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
without Christ, <hi>Acts 2. 37. Luke</hi> 15. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What oughtest thou to do on thy part in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to get this Grace?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I must not be idle, but I must, 1. Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
hear the Word. 2. Pray fervently to
Christ for the Spirit's Operations. 3. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and bewail my Condition. 4. Put a stop
to all wayes of sin to my utmost. 5. Carefully
entertain, and improve every motion of the
Spirit. 6. Strive with my Heart, and urge it
with all Gospel Arguments to obey the Call
of Christ, <hi>Prov. 2. 3, 4, 5. Mat.</hi> 13. 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What may a Sinner expect when he accepteth
of Christ?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He may expect, 1. To be united to
Christ in the nearest Relation. 2. To be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48747:70"/>
into a State of Pardon and Peace. 3. To
be adopted, and made still more conformable
to Christ in Grace and Holiness. 4. To be

5. And when he dies to be Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of the Glory of Christ in the highest Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,

do accept of Christ?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He abides under the wrath of God, and

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is this the condition of the Elect while they
abide in Vnbelief?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes: For tho God hath decreed, and
Christ hath purchased Faith and Life for them,
yet God hath determined by the Law of Faith,
that all are under condemnation untill they do
believe, <hi>Mar. 16. 16. Luke</hi> 13. 3. hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.

forth any other acts of Obedience?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Thô true Faith is a certain Principle of
Obedience, yet as soon as we believe we are
pardoned, even before there can be any time to
put forth any other acts of obedience, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6.</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> Do Repentance or Faith any way make satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to justice?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> No. That is only Christs work; but
God hath appointed that that Soul shall repent
and believe, on whom pardon for Christs sake
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48747:71"/>
shall be bestowed; and he hath solemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
hee'll forgive no man till then, <hi>Mark 16.

and save thee if thou believe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I have Gods Testimony, and Promise;

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, I am strongly engaged to submit
to Christ, because he bought me with his blood,
my Parents dedicated me to him in Baptism,
and love to my own Soul requires it, <hi>Rom, 14. 9.

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> My believing Parents were allowed, and

               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:48747:71"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> I engaged against being governed by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
or the Flesh as my Rulers, and against ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up with the worlds Goods as my portion,
and against the customes of the Men of this

vanity of mind, will not agree to this Covenant when
he is capable?</p>

to which thy Baptism engaged thee?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It's the damning Sin, and the heart of all
sin; for, 1. It's rebellion continued against my
Maker. 2. It's ingratitude and perjury to my
Redeemer. 3. It's gross injustice to my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.
4. It's an affront to all the Godly.
5. It's self-killing Cruelty to my own Soul,

               <hi>A.</hi> I will truly with my whole Soul consent
now, and live expressing my consent. And as

my fault be such as gives just cause to question
whether my consent was ever sincere, <hi>Psal. 32.

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. I must believe every thing to be a sin,
which is against the Word of God. 2. I must
humbly look to Christ for strength. 3. I must
avoid all occasions which lead to sin. 4. I must,
when I am tempted, consider what a dangerous
and evil thing sin is, and resolve against it,
