            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE many Diſcourſes that of late have been bandyed up and down by all Parties in this Kingdom touching your Gràce, hath been a great trouble to thoſe that are your Real Friends, who have not had an opportunity of communicating to You their Sentiments of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Clamours that concern Your Grace: And they cannot yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to do it for want of that Intimacy and Intereſt that ſome Ill Affected Perſons have with Your Grace, which hath admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred ſo much Noiſe and Talk among the Vulgar, and hath been ſo highly Detrimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to You, both in reſpect to Your Interest in the Kings Favour, and the Honour your Grace has attained to by your <hi>Heroick</hi> and <hi>Generous</hi> Actions, both at Home and Abroad, enough to make the whole World your Friend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> I have no Deſign in this Addreſs to YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>. but Humbly to Repreſent to Your Grace, what Sad Conſequences have befallen the Perſons of Princes and Great Men, by adhering to Flatterers, and Evil Councels, eſpecially ſuch as propoſe ways to the higheſt Honours imaginable, and yet at the ſame time lay a Foundation for their Eternal Diſhonour and Ruine. Thus have I ſeen Ambitious Men after they have been raiſed up from a Mean Fortune, become the greatest Statesmen and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites of their Prince, and at the ſame time been undermined by Flattering and Deceiptful Perſons, even to their utter Ruine: Inſtances enough there may be found in Records of lateſt Times. Not that by this I any ways Reflect upon the preſent

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44826:2"/>
Circumſtances of Your Grace; For YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> are a Perſon whom no Man has a greater Veneration and I onour for than my ſelf; Yet my Lord, when I conſider what ſtrange Sentiments the People have had of late concerning the preſent State of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and what great Influences ſome Ill Affected Perſons have over them, to make them fit for any Project that ſhall be propoſed for the Alteration thereof; I cannot but with great and juſt Complaint, and Indignation too, ſay, that they deſerve not the least Shelter in that Government, the Support of which only proceeds from Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity among our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> When a Nation grows weary of Government, it's high time for the Prince to look narrowly after the little Polititians that are Deſigning its Alteration and Ruine; And no one can better ſerve the Intereſt of his Prince and Country, then by finding out, and diſcovering the Intrigues of ſuch Men; And when found out, to make them Loathſom and Obnoxious to the People. This ought to be the Duty of every Loyal hearted Subject: And, as I am ſure 'tis your Graces Duty, ſo 'tis highly Your Interest; For by the Deſtruction of the Monarchy of <hi>England,</hi> and Government thereof no Ends can be ſerved, but thoſe that lead down to the Chambers of Death.</p>
            <p>That ſuch Men are abroad, and now at work in order thereunto, is not unknown to many of the Kings old and true Friends; who, though they have not been advanc'd to ſuch high places in the Government, nor rewarded for old Faithful Services, (through the Artifice of ſome late cunning Statesmen,) as others that never were (or ſcarce ever will be) Faithful to the King and Kingdoms Interest; yet have they both Hearts, and Wills, and Abilities too, (when ever lawfully commanded,) to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and Diſſipate too theſe LEADERS in the common wealth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>action. And my Lord, 'twill be all our Intereſts ſo to do; For let ſuch Men pretend to what they will, by advancing in the Opinion of the Vulgar ſuch a Man to day and to morrow deliver over another to the Rage of the People, by Loading and Branding him with odious Terms; 'Tis a Thouſand to one but the next day Him in they had ſo advanced in the Opinion of the People, ſhall be made the Object of their Scorn.</p>
            <p>When My Lord, We ſeriouſly Conſider, and Reflect on the past Actions of Men of ſuch Principles as theſe, We cannot but Loath and Abominate them: Oh how Happy is our Government, What a Good King, What Admirable Laws, What an Excellent Religion have we? (if rightly and truly obſerv'd,) and yet not contented, but ſeek after new Paths that lead to Confuſion and Ruine of all. <hi>My Lord,</hi> Before Government was ſettled in the first Ages of the World, that Eternal Rule of Juſtice of <hi>Doing to all Men as you would they ſhould do unto you,</hi> was an Obligation even to the very Heathens themſelves; That bound Contracts, kept Promiſes, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Truth, made Subjects Obedient, and Princes just: Why ſhall ſuch Men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Christianity, and not mind the Laws and Duties thereof. This Excellent Religion bids us by an expreſs Precept, (though to a Heathen Prince,) <hi>render to</hi> Caeſar <hi>his Tributes and Dues;</hi> It's true, in all other particulars it was neceſſary that the Inſtances and Minutes of Justice be appointed by the Laws and Customs of the ſeveral Kingdoms and Republicks, and therefore it was that Chriſtianity ſo well combined with the Government of Heathen Princes; Becauſe, whatſoever was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Juſt, or Declared ſo by the <hi>Political Power,</hi> their Religion bound them to obſerve, making Obedience to be a double Duty; a Duty both of Justice and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.<hi>—Thus the Chriſtian Loyal Subject.—</hi>But for the <hi>Democratical Man,</hi>

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:44826:2"/>
that is never quiet under any Government ſo long as it ſerves not his own private Intereſt; what Security can any Kingdom have of Him, neither Laws nor Councels, Oaths nor Engagements ſhall oblige Him to Duty and Obedience when He ſees it neceſſary to give a blow to the Government; from ſuch Perſons, and ſuch Company, it behoves all good Subjects to have no communication with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> Theſe are the Men that have made ſuch a Buſtle of late, with their Plots and Contrivances to bring <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s into Confuſion: Now as Your Grace is both by Duty and Intereſt oblig'd, ſo let the Humble Requeſt of your True and Real Friends, perſwade You to mind no other Intereſt beſides that of the <hi>Common Good;</hi> You are in the Eye of the People, and Belov'd by all, for thoſe Expreſſions of Goodneſs, and Valiant Acts You have perform'd both at Home and Abroad; It's much Lamented, and taken to Heart by your beſt Friends, that there are a ſort of Men who have made it their Buſineſs of late to advance You Higher than the Wiſdom and Favour of the King has made you; We do ſay They are Your Enemies, and ſeek after Your Ruine, though We doubt not at all that any of their pernicious and Self-deſigning <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ouncels ſhall ever Sway with ſo Noble and Prudent a Prince as Your Grace, to derogate in the least from thoſe Innate and Imbred Principles in Your Soul; of Loyalty and Obedience to the beſt of Kings,<hi>&amp;</hi>c.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Men, that would (with <hi>Joab</hi>) ſend for the Wiſe Woman, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade King <hi>David</hi> to admit of a Return for <hi>Abſalom</hi> his Son; and when they had effected it, leave him to himſelf, till Anger and Paſſion had ſet Fire to the Field of <hi>Joab</hi>: Theſe are the Men, that would have adviſed <hi>Abſalom</hi> to make Chariots, and to take <hi>50</hi> Men to run before him, and appoint his Time and Station, beſides the way of the Gate, to enquire of the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that came up to the King for Juſtice, what their Controverſies and Matters were; Theſe are the Men that would adviſe young <hi>Abſalom,</hi> that ſince <hi>David</hi> had appointed no one to hear their Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, (which was a <hi>Political Lie,</hi>) and relieve their Oppreſſions, to wiſh, <hi>O that I were made Judge in the Land, that every Man that hath any Suit or Cauſe, might come to Me, and I would do him Juſtice.</hi> In ſhort, theſe Principled Men were they that ſet on <hi>Abſalom</hi> to ſteal away the Hearts of the People from the King; Theſe are they that adviſed him to go to <hi>Hebron</hi> to pay his Vow; And Theſe were the Men that led him into Actual Rebellion againſt his Father, and to be deſtroy'd by ſome of the very Hands that had aſſiſted him in thoſe pernicious Councels.</p>
            <p>So that from hence we may conclude, that the greateſt ſafety in this World conſiſts in being Peaceable, and of a Submiſſive Spirit; A Spirit ſo Eminently ſeen by all People in Your Grace under the preſent Circumſtances, that You have won the Hearts of all Worthy Perſons, and Loyal Hearts.</p>
            <p>Now from what has been ſaid, I hope it will not give the leaſt Offence to You; For I do proteſt to Your Grace, I am ſo much Your Intirely Affectionate, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted Servant, that next to my Allegiance to my KING, and my Stedfaſtneſs to the Royal Intereſt, I Declare, I would in Defence of Your Perſon in any Juſt <gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
