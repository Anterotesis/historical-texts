            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>

And 1. whereas you ſeem to believe, that God by his Spirit hath put it into your hearts to do what hitherto you have done, and what now you profeſſe to deliberate to doe further againſt His Majeſty, and all others, who are now fallen into your hands; I beſeech you to conſider in the preſence of that God, to whoſe directions and Spirit you pretend, what ſafe ground you have for ſo doing. For, I ſhall ſuppoſe that the plaine words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are not that voice of the Spirit which is your onely guide in this matter: or if it be, I deſire that Charity from you for my ſelfe and others, that you will point us out thoſe Scriptures: and I muſt profeſſe to believe you bound in duty to God, and man, and to your ſelves, to ſatisfie this deſire, to produce that voice of the Spirit in the received Scriptures of God, which may ſay that to other Chriſtians alſo which it appeares to doe to you. But if Gods Spirit be by you conceived to have ſpoken to you any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way than in, or by ſome part of the written Word; then my ſecond requeſt is, that you will declare to others the ground of this your perſwaſion, that you have received any ſuch Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God; that ſo that pretended <hi>Spirit</hi> may according to the rules preſcribed by God in his acknowledged Word be tried and examined regularly, <hi>whether it be of God, or no?</hi> before the ſubject-matter of ſuch Revelation be believed infallible, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly built upon by you as your warrant or principle of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting any thing. For, there are <hi>evill Spirits</hi> that come into the world, and which many times are by God permitted to ſeduce men, and that they may doe ſo the better, they conſtantly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to come from God, and aſſume divine Authority to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and authorize their deluſions; (a thing ſo ordinary in all Ages, that the Poet that would expreſſe the Imbroyling of a Kingdome, thinks he cannot doe it better then by bringing in <hi>Alecto,</hi> a <hi>Fury,</hi> with a Meſſage from Heaven, to avenge ſuch or ſuch an injury.) And of theſe our Saviour forewarns us, and tells us, that <hi>we ſhall know them by their fruits;</hi> and ſo directs us to judge of the truth of their pretenſions by the goodneſſe and commendableneſſe, at leaſt, juſtifiableneſſe of their <hi>actions,</hi> and not to judge of their <hi>actions</hi> by their <hi>pretences.</hi> And beſides theſe <hi>evill ſpirits</hi> from without, there is alſo an <hi>evill ſpirit</hi> within, a great deale of diſguiſed wickedneſſe in the heart of man, which when
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53797:3"/>
it remaines unmortified in thoſe who believe themſelves to be <hi>Gods choſen Saints, and taught by him,</hi> is very apt to be miſtaken for an inclination of <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> and <hi>a flame of zeale,</hi> when it is really the moſt contrary to it: and becauſe there is ſo much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that what is not fetcht from the acknowledged Word of God, may thus flow from one of theſe contrary principles: my next requeſt is, that it be conſidered, whether when <hi>an Angel from Heaven,</hi> in caſe he ſhould <hi>teach any other Doctrine, than what had been by Saint</hi> Paul <hi>preached</hi> to his <hi>Galathians,</hi> were-to be <hi>ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematized,</hi> and when the judgments are ſo fearfull, which are pronounced againſt them which <hi>ſhall adde to the Words of that Propheſie,</hi> which we now reteine under the title of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> or <hi>Revelation</hi> (which being the laſt Writing which is knowne to be dictated by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> may very probably conteine a ſevere denuntiation againſt all thoſe, who pretend to any <hi>Revelation</hi> or <hi>Propheſie</hi> after that, concerning the Chriſtian Church) whether I ſay it be not a matter of fear and juſt apprehenſion, to all thoſe, who ſhall affix or impoſe upon the Spirit of God (or pretend to be revealed to them from that) any matter of Doctrine or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, which acknowledges not the Spirit of God ſpeaking in the Scripture for its onely warrant or foundation. Or laſtly, if from the Scriptures you conceive it may be proved, that any part of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> mentioned there ſo farre belongs to you, that it ſhall ſurely <hi>lead you into all truth:</hi> then firſt, I beſeech you to conſider, whether you doe not oblige your ſelves by the ſame, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture to prove to others (and not onely your ſelves to be perſwaded) that you are thoſe ſpeciall Saints of God, to whom that priviledge peculiarly belongs, and as clearly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that all others who conceive that that Unction teaches them directly the contrary to that which you profeſſe to be taught by it, are impious Perſons poſſeſt with that deluding Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which I now deſire you to beware of. And ſecondly, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether this differencing of your ſelves from others, this bearing witneſſe to your ſelves, and judging others (beſide that it will looke like an act of moſt <hi>Phariſaicall</hi> preſumption, and the very thing, which from <hi>Simon Magus</hi> downward, hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in all Hereticks, calling themſelves <hi>the Spirituall,</hi> and all others <hi>Animal, carnall Men)</hi> will not be alſo a great injuſtice at
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53797:4"/>
this time toward them who pretend not to learne any thing from this Unction, but what they receive from the Doctrine of the Goſpel, in thoſe Books, which have in effect, and in the laſt reſult, the teſtimony of God from Heaven, that they are his true infallible Word, and dictate of his Spirit; and which deſire to make no other uſe of this to their owne advantage, but onely topreſerve them in a quiet poſſeſſion of what by Law belongs to them, and a capacity of making good their Allegiance to Him, to whom they have often by Law been required to ſweare it.</p>
            <p>A ſecond principle which I muſt deſire you to review, is that, upon which you conclude that God hath borne teſtimony to your Cauſe by the many Victories which he hath given you: this concluding of yours, firſt, proceeds upon a premiſe directly falſe in matter of fact. For, you ſay that the King by taking up Armes made His <hi>appeale to Heaven,</hi> which 'tis moſt certain that He never did, (but onely uſed a ſtrength which God put in his hands to repell them, whom He look'd on as His Subjects declining their duty to Him, and invading the ſetled Lawes, and never referred the right of the Cauſe to be judged by the ſucceſſe of His Armes) nor indeed could rationally have occaſion to doe ſo, any more than any one of you would make ſuch appeale, when a violent Perſon ſhould invade, what you conceive to be your undoubted right; nor could He religiouſly, or Chriſtianly have done this, when thoſe Lawes that allow'd of ſuch appeales by <hi>Ordeale,</hi> or <hi>Duell,</hi> and the like, have been juſtly cenſured as unchriſtian and barbarous. Nay ſecondly, this concluding of yours will by the ſame reaſon infer that Chriſtianity is not, and that Mahumetiſme is the true Religion, becauſe when the Turkes aſſerted one, and the Greek Church the other, and that difference begat a Warre betwixt them, 'tis cleare that the Turkes were ſucceſsfull, and the Greeke Church was moſt ſadly waſted and ſubdued by them, and ſo remaineth to this houre in that unreturn'd Captivity. Which will therefore be a fit opportunity to make you revert to the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Spirit (which inclines you thus to argue) by this touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. 1. By conſidering and examining whether in the written Word any thing be more frequent and viſible than the <hi>ſufferings of Gods people,</hi> the <hi>ſhedding the bloud of the Saints,</hi> the faſtning all kind of cont<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>ties on ſuch, particularly that reproach of <hi>[you
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53797:4"/>
bloudy man]</hi> upon <hi>David,</hi> who was a <hi>King after Gods heart,</hi> the <hi>ſending</hi> or permitting <hi>an Hoſt againſt the daily ſacrifice to caſt down the truth to the ground, and to practice and proſper.</hi> 2. Whether it were not <hi>Rabſhekeh's</hi> Argument againſt the Peoples adhering to their lawfull <hi>King Hezekiah,</hi> that his Maſters Armes had been invincible. 3. Whether that ſaddeſt fate of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who for conquering of Gods people, and others, was by God ſtiled <hi>his Hammer,</hi> and <hi>Battleaxe of the whole earth,</hi> may not be expected the finall lot of others alſo; firſt, to deſtroy men, and then to be caſt out into the field, to inhabit among Beaſts. 4. Whether it were not a crime complained of by the people of God, in thoſe, which, when God was a <hi>little diſpleaſed,</hi> did as Adverſaries, <hi>help forward their affliction.</hi> And 5. whether the Pſalmiſt lay not the like ill character on all, who <hi>perſecute thoſe whom God hath ſmitten,</hi> and <hi>talke how they may vex them whom God hath wounded?</hi> By all which it is moſt evident, (without any neceſſity of defining or demonſtrating any thing of the juſtice of the Cauſe) that moſt commonly the proſperity of Armes hath not been <hi>the lot of the</hi> moſt <hi>righteous,</hi> but that either the <hi>chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the Sword is thought fit to be their <hi>diſcipline,</hi> or the comforts of peace (and not the triumphs of warre) their <hi>bleſſing</hi> in this life.</p>
            <p>The third principle is, your perſwaſion that the <hi>community of the People is the Supreme power, and that the KING is inferiour to them, and to them accountable for His breach of Truſt, of which you now affirme Him guilty.</hi> In this procedure of yours, there be many things worthy of your ſerious pondering: As whether 1. by Scripture: or 2. by Reaſon: or 3. by Story of times it can be concluded, that the <hi>Supreme Power</hi> was ever by God put into the hands of the community of the People. For the firſt way of concluding it, (the teſtimony of Scripture) I cannot but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of one place, which hath been produced to that purpoſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. Be <hi>ſubject to every humane Ordinance,</hi> or <hi>Creature,</hi> or <hi>Creation,</hi> &amp;c. This place I have ſome reaſon to believe to carry ſome weight with you, becauſe it was 6 years ſince for the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Cauſe againſt the <hi>King's party,</hi> produced by a Perſon of great dexterity, That very Perſon, who hath now undertaken to juſtifie your late proceedings ſo farre as not onely to clear them

[the expectation of the creature,</hi> or <hi>creation]</hi> is the hope which the <hi>heathen world</hi> had, that at the <hi>revelation</hi> of the gracious priviledges of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> they <hi>(i. e.</hi> the <hi>Gentiles)</hi> alſo ſhould be <hi>freed from the ſlavery of corruption</hi> (their villainous heathen ſinnes) <hi>unto the liberty,</hi> &amp;c. that true liberty not from obedience to Superiours, but from ſlavery to luſts and paſſions, which Chriſt came to beſtow upon us; And ſo when <hi>v.</hi> 22.

Agreeable to this notion of the <hi>whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or <hi>every creature,</hi> is this ſame phraſe (with the addition of <hi>humane,</hi> to take off all reſtraint, and to extend it as far as all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind) to be underſtood, and ſo the meaning of the precept of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to his <hi>Jew Chriſtians</hi> is clearly this and no more, that they muſt be <hi>obedient</hi> not onely to <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Magiſtrates, but to <hi>Gentiles, Heathen</hi> alſo, (ſuch as they ſhould fall under in all their <hi>diſperſions) i. e.</hi> to all whatſoever they were, and that <hi>for the Lords ſake</hi> who conſtituted thoſe Heathens alſo, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith.

               <hi>Inferiour,</hi> as the <hi>Inferiour</hi> to the <hi>Superiour,</hi> but as the nature of the duty inforces to interpret, the <hi>Inferiour</hi> to be ſubject to the <hi>Superiour</hi> onely: and 2. by the' Apoſtles expreſſe enumeration of thoſe to whom this obedience muſt be paid in the end of the Verſe, <hi>to the King as Supreme;</hi> and then, <hi>v.</hi> 14. to <hi>Governours,</hi> as inferiour Magiſtrates <hi>ſent by Him.</hi> That this is the full impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of that place, may (if there be any need) farther appeare by the occaſion of the Apoſtles diſcourſe, which was the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the vile ſect of Chriſtians then calling themſelves <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,</hi> (as a title of great perfection of <hi>knowledge</hi> in the Myſteries of Heaven) who taught the doctrine of <hi>liberty</hi> and manumiſſion to <hi>Chriſtian Subjects</hi> or <hi>Servants,</hi> from heathen (yea and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian) Maſters,</hi> and <hi>Kings;</hi> To which falſe doctrine of theirs this Exhortation thus interpreted is directly contrary (and cannot otherwiſe be pertinent to it) and very coherent to that Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition in the 12 <hi>ver.</hi> immediately preceding, of <hi>having their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation good among the Gentiles, that they might not ſpeake ill of them as evill Doers;</hi> which they would be juſtly apt to doe, in caſe they ſhould withdraw their obedience to their lawfull Princes, as ſoone as they were become Chriſtians; which, by the way, laies a very ill character upon thoſe, who by pretence of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> or <hi>piety,</hi> ſeeke, or claime to themſelves any other <hi>liberty,</hi> than what by the <hi>Lawes</hi> under which they are borne, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly belong unto them.</p>
            <p>Having thus farre enlarged to cleare that teſtimony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not knowing of any other which is thought favourable to your pretenſion, I ſhall, in ſtead of retorting the multitude of plaine places directly oppoſite, which will abundantly take away all force from this: proceed next to the ſecond plea, that of <hi>Reaſon.</hi> And there I ſhall deſire you to confider, 1. Whether if <hi>Adam</hi> had never fallen, and his poſterity remained in the ſame <hi>innocence,</hi> they would not yet have been capable of <hi>poſitive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> in order to civill life; and conſequently, whether in reaſon ſome one or more men ſhould not have had ſuperiority over all others, Parents over Children, and the like; and to this purpoſe, whether the divers Orders, and ſubordination of the Angels, that never fell, be not an evidence that even in ſtate of innocence, God deſigned ſuperiority, not equality. But then 2. The paſſions of

men being through ſin grown irregular, and ſo needing Rules and Lawes, and Rulers and Law-makers, it was both reaſonable, that God ſhould, and is moſt certaine that he did deſigne and appoint Government (as appears by what is ſaid by God to the firſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ſecond Man, to <hi>Eve, Gen.</hi> 3. 16. and to <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4. 7.) and ſo gave not all men that freedome which is the ſuppoſed foundation of that doctrine, which places <hi>ſupreme power in the People.</hi> And of any rationall perſon that yet thinks he did give this freedome to all mankind; I ſhould but aske this one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Whether ever any man were by God or nature inveſted with power of his owne life; I meane, with power to take away his owne life, or to kill himſelfe? In every thing elſe man may be believed to have a <hi>power</hi> over himſelfe, over his <hi>body,</hi> to cut or lance it, when that is for his turne, and particularly over that <hi>freedome</hi> which naturally belongs to him; whatever the degree of that be, a man may by act of his owne will, part with it irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſibly. Thus might the <hi>Jew</hi> under Gods owne government, give himſelf up wholly into the power of his <hi>Maſter,</hi> and by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his <hi>eare bored</hi> thorough, become from a <hi>Free-man,</hi> a <hi>Slave for ever,</hi> and generally thorow the whole world the courſe hath been the ſame, that he which is moſt free hath power over his owne liberty ſo to diveſt himſelf of it, as that it ſhall never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to him againe; and our <hi>Savionr</hi> that is thought to have brought <hi>liberty</hi> into the world, doth yet, by the quality of moſt of his <hi>precepts,</hi> given to Chriſtians by himſelfe and his Apoſtles, marke out this condition of <hi>ſubjection</hi> to them, as that under which they were generally to live, and from which the <hi>Chriſtian profeſſion</hi> ſhould be ſo farre from freeing them, that the ſtrict practice of <hi>obedience</hi> to heathen Rulers or Maſters, is oft preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed as a ſpeciall meanes to advance Chriſts maine end, to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie and promote the Goſpel. But for power over a mans owne <hi>life</hi> no man can be believed to be borne with it, for if he were, he might then as lawfully <hi>kill himſelfe</hi> (and if he might doe it <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> there are many caſes which might make it <hi>prudent</hi> for him to do it at ſome times) as pul out an aking tooth, or diſpoſe of his <hi>liberty</hi> or eſtate out of his owne poſſeſſion; a thing which no Chriſtian hath ever thought lawfull, but made this <hi>felonia de ſe,</hi> this ſelf-murther, or felony againſt ones ſelfe, a crime, as contrary

to the ſixt Commandement, as the <hi>killing of any other man.</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving proceeded thus farre, I ſhall now take that for granted, which, that I know of, is denied by none, I am ſure, which is not denied in the publiſht ſcheme of the deſigned <hi>Repreſentative, viz.</hi> that the <hi>ſupreme power</hi> includes the <hi>power of life,</hi> (I meane not ſuch an <hi>arbitrary</hi> power of killing whom they pleaſe without ſinne, but a power of putting capitall Malefactors to death, and ſo a <hi>power</hi> over every (call it Subjects or Free-mans) <hi>life</hi> in caſe of capitall crime) And the granting of this (as 'tis too viſible that it is by you a granted truth) being added to the former, doth to me irrefragably conclude, that the <hi>ſupreme power</hi> neither is, nor can be in the <hi>community of the People,</hi> or in their <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> by force meerly of their <hi>originall</hi> or <hi>naturall liberty;</hi> The inference is cleare, becauſe the <hi>power of life</hi> which is part of the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> is not part of that <hi>naturall liberty,</hi> and therefore is neither inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent naturally in that <hi>community of men,</hi> (which is but, in other words, ſo many particular men together, indow'd with that <hi>power</hi> (and no more) which every man hath <hi>ſingly</hi> over himſelf) nor conſequently by them communicable to any <hi>Repreſentative.</hi> And by this alſo it appeares, that <hi>ſupreme Magiſtracy,</hi> whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever 'tis truly placed, is the <hi>ordinance,</hi> and <hi>creation of God,</hi> (who alone hath <hi>power</hi> of all mens <hi>lives)</hi> and not of <hi>man,</hi> who hath no <hi>power</hi> of his <hi>owne,</hi> much leſſe of any others life, any farther then he is a <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> or <hi>Proxy,</hi> or <hi>Deputy of God,</hi> who hath that <hi>Power,</hi> not of the <hi>People,</hi> who have it <hi>not.</hi> For it is poſſible I may put you in mind of an evident truth, which perhaps you have not taken notice of; That, as the <hi>originall</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> in any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar place cannot be imagined to be by any more than two waies, Either <hi>Gods deſignment,</hi> or the <hi>Peoples act;</hi> ſo in either of thoſe two caſes 'tis <hi>God</hi> onely, and not the <hi>People,</hi> that gives the <hi>power of the Sword,</hi> or <hi>power of Life</hi> to the <hi>Governour;</hi> when <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe</hi> ſets a <hi>King</hi> over men, 'tis ſo cleare that <hi>be</hi> thus impowers <hi>that King,</hi> that that need not be proved; and when the <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a People</hi> (ſuppoſe in the <hi>Originall,</hi> ten men in the <hi>freedome of nature) chuſe</hi> one of themſelves, or more to rule over them; 'tis cleare, they doe not inveſt him with more <hi>power</hi> than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had; &amp; that he that was thus choſen by them, hath the <hi>power of life</hi> over any of them (which they ſingle, or all together in the

I have inſiſted the longer on this to make the miſtake the more palpable, and the more impoſſible not to be diſcerned by you; and if I could foreſee any colour of reaſon, that could poſſibly pretend againſt this evidence, I ſhould yet enlarge yours, and my owne trouble, to diſcover it; but being, I profeſſe, unable to mention any thing, which the grounds, which are already laid, have not prevented: I ſhall now proceed to the third and laſt way of examining this truth.</p>
            <p>By the hiſtory of times, and there I ſhall be forced to retract, at leaſt to ſuſpend the acknowledging of that, which, that I might examine it by reaſon, I was willing to <hi>ſuppoſe,</hi> but not <hi>grant,</hi> and ſhall now demand,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whether by any authentick <hi>ſtory</hi> it appeares, that there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were any Nation or People in the world, who can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed or proved to have had this <hi>ſupreme power</hi> veſted in the whole <hi>community originally,</hi> or from their firſt comming toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? or if ſo, whether <hi>Gods</hi> judgment ſo viſibly interpoſed, and the example of his inſtituting of <hi>Judges,</hi> and of <hi>Kings,</hi> (neither of them accountable to the People) be not to be preferred before all ſuch preſidents?</p>
            <p n="2">2. If 'twere granted, that in ſome <hi>one,</hi> or more places the <hi>power</hi> hath been <hi>originally</hi> in the People, yet it will never appeare by the originalls of <hi>all,</hi> or of <hi>this</hi> Kingdome, that in <hi>all</hi> or in <hi>this</hi> it was ſo; or if men will ſtill <hi>opiniate,</hi> and affirme againſt the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the <hi>Lawes,</hi> and <hi>conſtitution</hi> of this Kingdome, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe <hi>Oaths</hi> which have for ſo many yeares acknowledged the ſeat of the <hi>Supremacy in the King,</hi> and not in the <hi>People;</hi> yet that, which is ſo falſe in matter of fact, being taken for truth alſo, there will againe be matter of inquiry, in point of <hi>reaſon,</hi> which will deſerve your farthermoſt ſerious pondering:</p>
            <p>1. Whether, after that the <hi>People</hi> have upon deliberation, and from <hi>choice</hi> intruſted ſome <hi>one</hi> or <hi>more</hi> Perſons (in any certaine courſe of <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> by <hi>Law</hi> deſigned) to <hi>rule</hi> over them, and after

the <hi>Law</hi> hath declared the <hi>perſon</hi> of that <hi>Supream Magiſtrate</hi> not to be <hi>accountable,</hi> but his <hi>Miniſters</hi> only, (which may be a <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of State, more advantagious to a peoples peace, then poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly is well underſtood) whether, I ſay, in this caſe any number of men whatſoever, can, upon any pretence, <hi>re-call</hi> that <hi>Truſt,</hi> and <hi>void</hi> that <hi>Law,</hi> by which that KING, and His Heires for ever, were conſtituted the <hi>Ruler</hi> of them? or if they might, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this were not moſt contrary to the <hi>end</hi> of all Government, <hi>quiet,</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> and probably the parent of all <hi>confuſion</hi> in the world, which is much worſe than the <hi>hardeſt ſubjection?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay 2. if it ſhould be ganted ſtill, that the <hi>community of people</hi> have power to <hi>recall,</hi> or <hi>void that truſt,</hi> yet 'twill be matter of more than doubt againe, whether at <hi>this</hi> time in <hi>this</hi> Kingdome there be any way for the <hi>whole community</hi> to act, or whether it can by any man be reaſonably believed, that what is <hi>now</hi> done, is <hi>acted</hi> by the <hi>community of the People?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if (to that purpoſe) it be conceived, that the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> is (or that the two Houſes together are) the <hi>Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative</hi> of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>People;</hi> Then firſt, it is to be conſidered that there is a great number of men in this <hi>Kingdome,</hi> that are <hi>not</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by <hi>theſe,</hi> and who never put (nor can by any interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation be thought to have put) into their hands that <hi>Power,</hi> which is ſuppoſed to be in every free <hi>Commoner</hi> in this Kingdome. 2. That you your ſelves have expreſt your opinion, that this, which now is, is an <hi>unequall Repreſentative,</hi> and have on that conſideration thought your ſelves obliged to <hi>propound</hi> another Forme. 3.

'Tis clear, that in ſuch an acknowledged conjuncture of time as this is, a <hi>ſmall</hi> (farre leſſe) <hi>part</hi> of thoſe that were <hi>returned</hi> by the Countries, cannot be ſaid to be that <hi>entire</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,

or body, by which the <hi>whole community</hi> is repreſented; Or if it be ſaid, that the <hi>godly People of the Land,</hi> who by <hi>Petitions</hi> to the <hi>Generall,</hi> the <hi>Lord Fairfax</hi> have expreſt their deſires, that <hi>Juſtice</hi> be executed upon thoſe, whom they call <hi>Delinquents,</hi> are to be reputed as the <hi>community of the People:</hi> then firſt, it will be clear, that thoſe that have ſo <hi>Petitioned</hi> (beſide, that they are moſt of the body of the <hi>Army)</hi> are not the thouſandth part of the people of this <hi>Kingdome,</hi> and therefore cannot by any rule of Judgement or Eſtimation be reputed as the whole <hi>Community;</hi> and if this <hi>preſident</hi> might be admitted, that a <hi>few</hi> perſons, under the title of the <hi>Godly,</hi> may pretend to the right of the <hi>whole,</hi> tis very well worth foreſeeing, how <hi>dangerous</hi> ſuch <hi>examples</hi> may prove to the <hi>peace</hi> of Poſterity. 2. All the evidence of their <hi>godlineſſe</hi> that we can perceive, is only their deſiring <hi>liberty</hi> for themſelves and others, and therefore <hi>Juſtice</hi> on thoſe who ſtand in their way to that <hi>liberty;</hi> and I conceive it demonſtrable that a quiet <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> and a deſire not to caſt off their <hi>duty,</hi> but ſtill to continue under it, rather then to be their own <hi>carvers,</hi> or contrivers of <hi>liberty,</hi> is a farre ſurer ſigne of <hi>true god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</hi> And thirdly, there hath yet been no fair indifferent meanes uſed to know whether there be not farre greater numbers of ſuch <hi>godly</hi> meek men, who would rather deſire that the KING ſhould be reſtored to His Government, then that any courſe ſhould be taken by any, <hi>without,</hi> or <hi>againſt the</hi> KING. And the plain truth is, that if you will go on in the courſe you are in, and yet deſire freely to appear, and be accounted the <hi>Conſervers,</hi> and not <hi>Conquerours</hi> of the <hi>liberty</hi> of your Country-men, if you will not impoſe upon the people, as you ſay <hi>Kings</hi> have done; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more ſutable to thoſe <hi>pretences,</hi> then to <hi>declare moſt publickly,</hi> that it ſhall be free for every man to <hi>ſubſcribe,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he doth deſire this totall <hi>change</hi> by you tendred in the draught of your <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> or the continuance of the preſent eſtabliſhed Government, (with an aſſurance of your ſubmiſſion thereunto.) 4. 'Tis (upon ſuppoſition that all <hi>power</hi> is <hi>originally</hi> in the <hi>People)</hi> moſt undeniable and clear, that nothing but the <hi>conſent</hi> of each perſon (at leaſt of a <hi>major part</hi> of the whole being convoked together) can diveſt any one, or more men of that their ſuppoſed <hi>Originall right;</hi> and conſequently, that other mens

ſaying that they are not <hi>Godly,</hi> and that themſelves are ſo, can never exclude them from their <hi>Birthright;</hi> By which it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly be concluded, that all thoſe that have adhered to the KING all this time, or that favour'd the <hi>Votes of the two Houſes,</hi> which reſolved the KING's late Conceſſions at <hi>Newport</hi> to be a fit ground of peace (whatſoever cenſure or brand is by you ſet upon them) are as much to be conſidered to the making up the <hi>community</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> as any others. And if ſo, Let it then be conſidered by all equall minded men, what a <hi>violation</hi> it is of thoſe <hi>Rights,</hi> which you pretend to vindicate, what an invaſion of the <hi>naturall freedome</hi> of your Brethren (by you acknowledged, the <hi>inheritance</hi> of <hi>each</hi> man) to force them againſt their <hi>wills,</hi> with their very great incommodation and detriment, to <hi>revert</hi> to that <hi>liberty,</hi> which is by you ſuppoſed to belong to all <hi>naturally,</hi> but without which we of this Nation have happily lived, under the farre greater advantages of <hi>Regall government.</hi> And yet ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this <hi>principle</hi> have you now proceeded, that when you have thus throwne us back into our firſt <hi>chaos</hi> againe, onely that you may reduce our <hi>liberty,</hi> you then immediately by your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative</hi> ſo bind us up, that we are not permitted, upon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever emergency, to caſt our ſelves into any <hi>new forme,</hi> although the exchange ſhould appeare never ſo advantageous, and gainfull to us; which beſides that, it is an evidence of your inward <hi>feare,</hi> that the change now deſigned will be ſoone repented of againe, is certainly ſo farre from being an <hi>enlarging,</hi> that it is the <hi>retren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi> of our <hi>liberty,</hi> and denying us that <hi>freedome,</hi> of which the moſt <hi>barbarous</hi> and the moſt <hi>civilized</hi> People have been equally partakers, when ſubjection ſeemed better for their turnes. As beſide the examples of the <hi>Servants</hi> in <hi>Exodus,</hi> which are there ſuppoſed ſometimes to preferre their ſervitude to their Maſters before the priviledge of the <hi>Sabbaticke yeare,</hi> we find practiſed by the <hi>Campanians,</hi> who voluntarily caſt themſelves at the feet, and ſurrendred themſelves into the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to purchaſe thereby that right of being <hi>protected</hi> by them; &amp; by many <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> in <hi>Appia,,</hi> who ſent <hi>Embaſſadours</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> on purpoſe to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition the favor of being receivd into the number of their <hi>ſubjects.</hi>

            <p>The laſt principle to be review'd is this, That there having been much <hi>bloud</hi> ſpilt in this Kingdome in the late Warres, there muſt now be ſome <hi>ſacrifice</hi> offer'd to <hi>God (i. e.</hi> ſome more <hi>bloud</hi> ſhed) for the <hi>expiation</hi> of that ſinne of <hi>bloudguiltineſſe,</hi> before <hi>God</hi> can be <hi>pacified,</hi> or <hi>reconciled</hi> to the <hi>Land.</hi> On which particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, it will firſt be worth your ſerious enquiry, how it ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that that great iſſue of <hi>bloud,</hi> let out in the late Warres (which hath with great reaſon been lookt on, as the ſharpeſt of <hi>Gods plagues,</hi> and the ſaddeſt part of <hi>puniſhment</hi> of the former ſinnes of this Nation) is now the maine, and onely <hi>ſinne</hi> of the Land, with which God is not <hi>reconciled:</hi> Or 2. if it were ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be ſo, yet how it can be thought that a <hi>generall Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of that ſinne, an <hi>humiliation</hi> before God for it, through the whole Land, and a <hi>reſolution</hi> never to <hi>ſpill one drop</hi> more, were not a more <hi>Christian</hi> probable meanes to <hi>pacifie God,</hi> than the proceeding in cold bloud to the <hi>effuſion</hi> of <hi>more:</hi> The <hi>bloud</hi> of <hi>men</hi> being never thought a fit ſacrifice for any, but the evill Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and <hi>peaceable-mindedneſſe,</hi> and <hi>charity,</hi> and the <hi>contrite heart</hi> being the ſpeciall, if not onely <hi>ſacrifices,</hi> which we find mention'd in the Goſpel. Or 3. how it can appeare that if <hi>God</hi> require any ſuch <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> you, or any but thoſe whom the knowne Lawes of the Land have placed in a Tribunall (and that legally erected for <hi>ſuch cognizances)</hi> have any right to put your ſelves into the office of <hi>Gentile Prieſts,</hi> as the onely Perſons appointed to <hi>ſlay that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi> Nay 4. it will be worth your obſerving, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the <hi>office</hi> of a <hi>Judge,</hi> and thereby rendred very unfit for any of you to put your ſelves unto that <hi>office</hi> by vertue of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther title, but that of being his <hi>Diſciples.</hi> And laſtly, it is worth your ſaddeſt thought, Whether by your preſent <hi>Councell,</hi> and the <hi>neceſſity</hi> by you ſuppoſed of <hi>changing</hi> the <hi>former Government,</hi> it doe not now appeare, that the <hi>defence</hi> of the <hi>eſtabliſhed Lawes</hi> was on the KING's part the occaſion of His taking <hi>Armes,</hi> and on <hi>Your</hi> parts, the deſigne of <hi>altering</hi> thoſe <hi>Lawes,</hi> and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing <hi>others</hi> more ſutable to your inclinations. And if now by a <hi>civill</hi> or <hi>martiall</hi> courſe, in an <hi>arbitrary</hi> way of triall, contrary to the <hi>Lawes</hi> eſtabliſhed, it ſhould be by you thought fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

to <hi>bloud</hi> againſt thoſe whom engagements have been for the <hi>defence</hi> of thoſe <hi>eſtabliſht Lawes:</hi> Let it be conſider'd, how <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politick</hi> this may be, and what matter of <hi>diſcouragement</hi> to all that ſhall be intruſted with the managery, or <hi>defence</hi> of future <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:</hi> Which ſingle conſideration will, I hope, abate much of your deſigned <hi>ſeverity.</hi> But if <hi>God</hi> ſhould permit you to go on undiſturb'd to the <hi>ſhedding</hi> of <hi>more bloud,</hi> as the <hi>Jewes</hi> did from other lower acts to the <hi>crucifying their King:</hi> How poſſible were it, not onely that this ſhould prove the provoking of <hi>God</hi> to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you up for ever to your owne hearts</hi> luſts, but be to the whole <hi>Nation</hi> a <hi>filling up the meaſure of our iniquities,</hi> and the forerunner of all the <hi>calamities,</hi> that can befall a People.</p>
            <p>Having mention'd the <hi>weakneſſe,</hi> and <hi>fallibleneſſe</hi> of theſe few <hi>principles,</hi> I ſhall leave you to the farther conſideration of the <hi>frailneſſe,</hi> and <hi>danger</hi> of thoſe <hi>ſuperſtructures,</hi> which ſhall be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected on any, or all of theſe.
