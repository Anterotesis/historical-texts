            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough I could not eaſily perſwade
my ſelf to expoſe this following Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to publick view, yet after I was once
reſolved to venture it abroad, I was ſoon
determined to whom I ought to preſent
it. To your Intereſt and Favour I chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
owe my being placed in this Pariſh, to
your Countenance my greateſt Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
here, and if it may gain your
Acceptance and Approbation, I ſhall but
little value the uncertain Judgment of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54114:3"/>
Upon how many this plain homely
Diſcourſe may have good effect, I cannot
gheſs; how many it will anger and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
I am not at all concerned: and tho
I may be thought by ſome ill advis'd in
publiſhing ſuch a Sermon, yet every one
will commend and juſtifie my Diſcretion
in prefixing your Name before it: for ſo
great an awe have the Enemies of our
Church and Government of your Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Fidelity to both, of your undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Zeal and Activity for the Service of
both, that they will not dare loudly to
condemn what you are pleaſed to protect.
They will be juſtly afraid of quarrelling
with me, when they know I have engaged
you on my ſide.</p>
            <p>I am very ſenſible, that in this Age we
live ſome are ſo extraordinarily wiſe and
wary, as to cenſure and diſcourage all
Men that ſpeak roundly and act vigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the King and Church, as being
<pb facs="tcp:54114:3"/>
more forward and buſie than is needful:
but I am alſo as ſenſible, that if ſome Men
had not ſhewn more Courage and Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
than thoſe prudent Perſons, both
would have been by this time in far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
danger, than at this preſent, Thanks be
to God, they are.</p>
            <p>For my own part, no one is more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to a truly tender Conſcience than
my ſelf, let it be as nice and ſcrupulous
as it can well be, ſo it be about the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
matters of Piety towards God, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
between Man and Man, due Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to Superiours, and when it makes
us more exactly careful of our undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Duty in all Inſtances: But, when Men
are ſcrupulous only on one ſide, about
things commanded by lawful Authority,
and make no Scruple of Diſobedience,
Schiſm, Faction, and Diviſion; when Men
ſet up their private Humour, Fancy, or
Opinion, in oppoſition to eſtabliſhed Laws,
<pb facs="tcp:54114:4"/>
when they become peeviſh, pragmatical,
and ungovernable; nay, when Mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
prove ſo generally tender and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous,
as to doubt of and ſuſpect the
Rights of the Crown, (for that Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that is ſo tender againſt the Church
is alſo uſually as tender againſt the King)
ſuch wayward skittiſh Conſciences ought
to be well bridled and reſtrained, or elſe
they will be not only intolerably trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
but extreamly miſchievous both to
Church and State.</p>
            <p>That the Bleſſed Rewards of Vertue
and Loyalty may plentifully deſcend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your Self, and all that belong to you,
both in this Life and that which is to come,
is the earneſt Prayer of</p>

               <q>But rather give Alms of ſuch things as you

you.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE occaſion of theſe Words was this. Whilſt our
Bleſſed Saviour was after his wonted manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
the People, a certain <hi>Phariſee,</hi> either in
ſome meaſure pleaſed with his Diſcourſe, or elſe
that he might catch an advantage againſt him, beſought
him to dine with him. Our Lord, who refuſed no fair op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of doing good, would not diſdain to go to the
Houſes, either of the greateſt Sinners, or his moſt deadly
Enemies; would converſe familiarly with them, and eat
at their Tables, that by ſuch obliging condeſcenſion he
might by degrees win them to the love and embracing
of Divine truth. He was the great Phyſician of Souls, and
went about continually viſiting his Patients, all thoſe whoſe
Minds ſtood in need of his help or cure. He conſulted
their Benefit more than his own Safety or Reputation. He
would keep company with Publicanes and Sinners, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the reforming of them, tho he himſelf for doing ſo
ſhould be thought one of them; and he frankly accepted
the invitation of Phariſes, tho he knew they lay in wait
for him, and deſign'd only to intrap him.</p>
            <p>He went in therefore with the Phariſee into his Houſe,
and without any of thoſe previous Waſhings and Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
which the <hi>Jews</hi> religiouſly uſed before eating, he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54114:5"/>
ſat down to meat. This the ſtrict Phariſee thought a great
Prophaneneſs and Wickedneſs in his Gueſt. He wondred
that ſo great a Prophet and Preacher of Righteouſneſs as
our Saviour pretended to be, ſhould ſo ſcandalouſly vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the Traditions of the Elders, <hi>verſe 38. And when the
Phariſee ſaw it, he marvelled that he had not firſt waſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Dinner:</hi> for as St. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us upon a like occaſion,
Mark 7. 3. <hi>The Phariſees, and all the Jews, except they waſh
their hands, eat not, holding the Tradition of the Elders.
And when they come from the Market, except they waſh, they
eat not. And many other things there be which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to hold, as the waſhing of Cups, and of Pots, and of
braſen Veſſels, and of Tables.</hi> Things not ordained by God,
nor any part of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Laws, but the rules and preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their Rabbies or Scribes; obſerved, at leaſt by the
ſtricteſt part of the Jews, out of an Opinion that true puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of mind was to be obtain'd and preſerved by ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
waſhings. For of ſuch neceſſity did they think theſe
outward. Purgations to be, that it was a determined caſe
amongſt them, that if any one in great diſtreſs had Water
ſufficient for waſhing, but not enough to waſh and drink
too, he ought rather to periſh by Thirſt than neglect to
waſh himſelf; and it was commonly ſaid amongſt them,
that to eat with unwaſhen hands was a greater Pollution,
than to defile ones Body with an Harlot.</p>
            <p>Now this our Saviour with great zeal reproves in the
Phariſees, in the Verſes before my Text, <hi>Now do ye Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees
make clean the out-ſide of the Cup and Platter, but your
inward part is full of ravening and Wickedneſs. Ye Fools,
did not he that made that which is without make that which
is within alſo?</hi> That is to ſay, that which God regards is the
purity of your Minds, the cleanſing your Hearts from all
evil affections and filthy luſts; and all your outward waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
without this internal purity, are but as if a man ſhould
waſh his Veſſels, the out-ſide of them only, leaving the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54114:5"/>
of them full of all filthineſs and naſtineſs. Thus do ye
Phariſees waſh your Bodies, whilſt your Souls and Spirits
remain full of all Uncleanneſs, of Malice, and Wickedneſs.
If you would obey and pleaſe God, you muſt cleanſe that
which is within as well as that which is without: then he
adds the Words of my <hi>Text, But rather give Alms of ſuch
things as you have; and behold, all things are clean unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſeveral Meanings given of theſe Words by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters,
with which I ſhall not now trouble you, but
only propound that which I ſhall chooſe to inſiſt upon. It
is very ordinary in Scripture to expreſs the whole of our
Duty or Religion by ſome one part or eminent Inſtance
of it; as very frequently by Charity, ſo here by one prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
part of Charity, giving of Alms. So that the Senſe
ought not to be reſtrained to this ſingle duty of Alms-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
to the excluſion of the reſt; but all other Duties,
that are of the ſame weight and neceſſity, are here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
as well as that one which is mentioned. And then
the Senſe is this, Mind chiefly the great, and moral, and
ſubſtantial parts of Gods Laws, ſtudy thoſe Duties that are
of eternal and indiſpenſable Obligation, be moſt zealous
and ſollicitous for the matters of Piety, Righteouſneſs, and
Charity, and <hi>behold all things are clean unto you;</hi> that is,
ye need not then be ſo anxious or concerned about theſe
little things, nor ſo ſtrictly tye up your ſelves to ſuch For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities
and external Rites. If you be but ſeriouſly dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
about your main and undoubted Duty, you will be
more indifferent about Meats and Drinks, nor will you
lay ſo great a ſtreſs upon any Singularities or Affectations
in Religion. Be but exactly careful to avoid every thing
which God hath forbid, to do every thing which he hath
expreſly commanded, and then trouble not your Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
about eating with unwaſhen hands. Thus, as <hi>Grotius</hi>
upon theſe Words obſerveth, they ſignifie the ſame with
what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Titus 1. 15. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the pure all things are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54114:6"/>
pure.</hi> They who keep themſelves unſpotted from all ſinful
Pollutions, who ſtrictly abſtain from unlawful Freedoms,
may with a ſafe Conſcience uſe any unlawful Liberty, and eat
any kind of meats, with waſhen or unwaſhen hands.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the ſenſe of the Words ſeemeth to be this;
Mind your plain and neceſſary Duty, and trouble not your
ſelves with Scruples about little and indifferent things.
Whence I ſhall take occaſion to diſcourſe of what is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called a ſcrupulous Conſcience: which I have choſen to
do, not out of a deſign to expoſe or upbraid the weakneſs
of any, but rather charitably to contribute what I can to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the healing and curing of it: and this I take for
granted, That we cannot do greater Service either to the
Church of Chriſt or Souls of Men, than by all prudent
means to root out thoſe needleſs ſcruples out of their minds,
which hath been the occaſion of ſuch unchriſtian Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and dangerous Diviſions amongſt us, at firſt begun,
and ſtill maintained generally upon the account of ſuch
things, as I verily believe a well inſtructed Conſcience need
not be concerned or diſturbed about.</p>
            <p>I ſhall firſt ſhew you what I underſtand by a ſcrupulous
Conſcience, then obſerve ſome few things concerning it,
and laſtly, offer ſome plain Rules and Means by which we
may beſt get rid of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, What is a ſcrupulous Conſcience? Now Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as it is a Rule of our Actions, is nothing elſe, but a
Man's Mind or Judgment concerning the moral Goodneſs
or Evil, Lawfulneſs or Unlawfulneſs of things; and as
this Judgment is either true or falſe, ſo is our Conſcience
either good and well grounded, or erroneous, The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Law made known to us either by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or plain Scripture, or direct conſequence from it,
ſuch as any honeſt man may underſtand, is the rule of
Conſcience, or of that Judgment we make of the Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or Unlawfulneſs of things. So that our Conſcience
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54114:6"/>
is a ſafe Rule and Guide of our Actions no farther than
as it ſelf is directed and warranted by the Law of God.</p>
            <p>1. A good and well grounded Conſcience is, when we
carefully abſtain from whatever God hath forbidden, don't
neglect doing any thing which he hath commanded, and
as for other matters left indifferent and at Liberty, we do
them or forbear doing of them according as the Rules of
obedience to Superiours, Prudence, and Charity, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
This is the Health and ſound State of the Mind.</p>
            <p>2. An erroneous Conſcience is, when we judge that to
be evil or unneceſſary which God hath expreſly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and is our Duty; or that to be good and neceſſary
which he hath plainly forbid, and is really ſinful. Now
our Conſciences cannot alter the nature of things: that
which is our Duty remaineth ſo, and we ſin by omitting it,
notwithſtanding we in our Conſciences think it unlawful
to be done; and what is really Evil continueth ſuch, and
is Sin in us, however our Conſciences tell us it is our duty
to do it: and the fault is more or leſs compaſſionable and
pardonable, as the cauſes of the Error are more or leſs vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
and avoidable. This is a grievous Diſeaſe and
deadly Sickneſs of the Mind, when we thus groſsly err in
our Judgments, and act according to our miſtaken Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of things.</p>
            <p>3. A ſcrupulous Conſcience is converſant about things in
their own Nature indifferent, and it conſiſts</p>
            <p>Either in ſtrictly tying up our ſelves to ſome things
which God hath no where commanded; as the <hi>Phariſees</hi>
made great Conſcience of waſhing before they did eat, and
abundance of other unneceſſary Rites and Uſages they had
of Mens own inventing and deviſing, which they as reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly,
nay more carefully obſerved than the indiſputable
Commands of God himſelf:</p>
            <p>Or in a conſcientious abſtaining from ſome things which
are not forbid, nor any ways unlawful. <hi>Touch not, taſte
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54114:7"/>
not, handle not,</hi> doubting and fearing where no fear is,
thinking that they ſhould as much offend God by eating
ſome kind of Meats, wearing ſome Garments, as they
ſhould do were they guilty of Murder and Adultery.
Which is the caſe of many amongſt us, who by ſuch Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloſity
about little matters ſeem more preciſe and auſtere
than other good and honeſt Chriſtians are, or themſelves
need or ought to be.</p>
            <p>For be it from me, by any thing I ſhall now ſay, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the greateſt and tendereſt care any Chriſtian can
take to keep himſelf from all Sin, from all Occaſions and
Temptations to it, from the leaſt appearance of Evil, of
what is really ſuch: and to do any thing that is in it ſelf
ſinful, out of confidence that it is lawful, is far worſe and
a more grievous offence than to abſtain from many things
which are truly lawful, out of an Opinion that they are
ſinful. Notwithſtanding this, I cannot but reckon it the
chief Policy of the Devil, the grand Enemy of all that is
good, when he cannot perſuade us that there is nothing at
all ſinful or unlawful, then to make us ſuſpect every thing
for ſuch, or at leaſt, that there is great danger of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
God by the moſt indifferent and innocent Actions; by
theſe means enſnaring and entangling Mens Conſciences,
and rendring Religion a moſt troubleſome burden to
them.</p>
            <p>A ſcrupulous Conſcience therefore ſtarts and boggles,
where there is no real Evil or Miſchief; is afraid of omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
or doing what may be omitted or done without Sin.
Which I know not how better to illuſtrate than by thoſe
unaccountable Antipathies or Prejudices that ſome men have
againſt ſome ſort of Meats, or living Creatures, which have
not the leaſt harm or hurt in them, yet are ſo offenſive and
dreadful to ſuch Perſons, that they fly from them as they
would from a Tyger or Bear, and avoid them as they would
do the Plague or Poyſon. Juſt thus do ſome Men run out
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54114:7"/>
of the Church at the ſight of a Surplice, as if they had been
ſcared by the apparition of a Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>I. proceed to the ſecond thing I propounded, to obſerve
to you ſome few general things concerning this ſcrupulous
Conſcience; as,</p>
            <p>1. That this is a very ſickly, crazy temper of mind, a
great indiſpoſition, a ſtate of weakneſs and infirmity. It
ariſeth from Ignorance and want of right underſtanding
our Religion, from undue timerouſneſs or unſetledneſs of
mind, from melancholy, or unreaſonable prejudices and
miſtakes about the nature of things. Such ſcrupulous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
are like fearful Women, that wander in the dark, who
ſeeing nothing to affright them, yet fancy many things,
which make them tremble every ſtep they take: or like
thoſe who ſee only by an uncertain glimmering twilight,
their Imagination once abus'd and prepoſſeſs'd, transforms
every Object into a Monſter or Gyant.</p>
            <p>Thus this Scrupulous is the ſame with what in other
Words ſome call a tender Conſcience, ſo tender that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing hurts and wounds it, like a tender Eye which the
leaſt Duſt or Smoak grievouſly offends, or a tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of Body, which the leaſt Air or Wind mightily
diſorders and diſcompoſes. Now this is far from being
any Vertue or Commendation in us, this is no deſirable
Qualification, nor a matter of Ambition to be thought
men of ſuch tender Conſciences, no more than it is for a
man's Reputation to be ſickly and often indiſpos'd. A good
Conſcience is firm and ſteady, well ſetled and reſolved,
and ſuch needleſs Scruples about things lawful are at the
beſt a ſign of an ungovern'd Fancy, and a weak Judgment.
As the niceneſs and ſqueamiſhneſs of a mans Stomach that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſts
wholſom Food is a ſimptom of an unſound and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy
Body. This doth not argue any extraordinary holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or purity above others, as the Phariſee conceited of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<hi>ſtand off, come not 'nigh me, touch me not, for I am holier
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54114:8"/>
than thou,</hi> becauſe he waſhed himſelf ſo often. No, we are
yet in a childiſh ſtate, and whilſt we are frighted with
ſuch Bug-bears and Phantaſms, we have not yet arrived to
the Underſtanding or Reſolution of a Man.</p>
            <p>2. This Scrupuloſity about little matters may be, and
is often a ſign of Hypocriſie. I take not upon my ſelf to
judge any Perſons. Let every man look to himſelf; but
thus certainly it was with the Scribes and Phariſees of old;
They ſtrained at every Gnat, ſtumbled at every Straw,
would ſtarve ſooner than eat their Meat with defiled hands,
would not for the World wrong a man of a Cummin-ſeed,
or a ſpear of Mint, and by this wonderful exactneſs and
ſtrictneſs in ſome inſtances, they eaſily gained the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the greateſt Saints; ſo that it is ſaid to have been
an ordinary Proverb among the Jews, <hi>That if but two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in the World, went to Heaven, one of them would be a
Scribe the other a Phariſee.</hi> Yet for all this, if we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
our Saviour's account of them, they made nothing of
ſwallowing Camels, living in the greateſt and moſt known
Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>Alas! their Conſciences would not give them leave to
enter into the Governours Hall to go amongſt the Heathens,
for fear of being polluted by them, yet at the ſame time they
ſtuck not at ſuborning falſe Witneſſes againſt the beſt and
moſt innocent Perſon that ever lived. They blamed the
Diſciples for plucking the ears of Corn on the Sabbath-day,
as if they, poor tender-hearted men, were offended and
grieved to the Soul at ſuch Prophaneneſs, and yet they
thought it nothing to deny relief and ſuccour to their own
Parents when in Want or Diſtreſs; they made no Bones of
Rapine and Extortion, oppreſſing the Poor, or devouring
Widows Houſes. By their curioſity about theſe external
Obſervances, they hoped to make amends for their groſs
Tranſgreſſions in other caſes of far greater weight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Since they denied themſelves many things which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54114:8"/>
God had allow'd them, they hop'd he would readily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
them, tho in ſome other things they took a greater
Liberty than he had permitted them.</p>
            <p>Had any of us been preſent when <hi>Mary,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> 12. 3.
took the Ointment of Spikenard, very coſtly, and anointed
the Feet of Jeſus, and had heard <hi>Judas</hi>'s Rebuke, <hi>Why was
not this Ointment ſold for three hundred pence, and given to
the Poor?</hi> (He ſcrupled ſuch a profuſe expence, tho about
our Saviour himſelf. He thought it might have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
employ'd, to more uſeful purpoſes.) Should we not from
this have ſtrait concluded him the moſt charitable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious
of all Chriſt's Diſciples, and yet this over-great
care for the Poor was only a pretence and covering for his
theeviſh Intention.</p>
            <p>They therefore who are ſo ſcrupulous about little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
matters, ought to approve their Honeſty and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
by the moſt accurate Diligence in the Practiſe of all
other Duties of Religion, which are plainly and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
ſuch. They who pretend to ſuch a tender Conſcience
above other Men muſt know, that the World will watch
them as to the fairneſs and juſtice of their Dealings, the
calmneſs of their Tempers, their behaviour in their ſeveral
Relations, their Modeſty, Humility, Charity, Peaceableneſs,
and the like. If in all theſe things they keep the ſame Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
uſe the ſame caution and circumſpection, and be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly
conſcientious, then it muſt be acknowledged, that
it is only Weakneſs or Ignorance that raiſeth their Scruples,
not any vicious Principle; and the condition of thoſe who
are under the power of ſuch Scruples, is much to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerated.</p>
            <p>But, when I ſee a Man ſcrupling praying by a Book or
Form, and yet living without any Senſe of God or Fear
of him, afraid of a Ceremony in God's Worſhip, and not
afraid of a plain damnable Sin, of Covetouſneſs, raſh cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
his Brethren, of Hatred and Strife, Faction and Schiſm,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54114:9"/>
and diſobedience to Superiours; when I ſee one that out
of Conſcience refuſeth to kneel at the Sacrament, and yet
dares totally neglect the Communion; who takes great care
not to give offence to his weak Brother, but can freely
ſpeak evil of Dignities, and deſpiſeth his lawful Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours;
it is not then uncharitable to ſay, That it is not
dread of diſpleaſing God, but ſome other bye end or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
that acts and moves ſuch a Perſon, and in pleading
the Tenderneſs of his Conſcience he is no other than a
downright Hypocrite.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, Let a Man be never ſo punctual and
critical in his Conformity to all the appointed Ceremonies
and Uſages in our Church, let him conſtantly attend Gods
ſolemn Worſhip, and behave himſelf moſt reverently and
decently at the Publick Prayers, yet if this Man be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
and intemperate, a Derider of true Piety and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
if he lives looſly and at Random, all his regular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,
all his bowing and kneeling to the Honour of our
Saviour, all his niceneſs about his Worſhip to perform it
in the moſt orderly manner, all his Zeal for the Church
ſhall avail him nothing. He is no better than the Phariſee,
waſhing the out-ſide, whilſt he is within full of all Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
and Uncleanneſs. To be ſo concerned about little
things, whilſt we make no Conſcience of the greater, is
the moſt evident ſign that can be given of a falſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.
And hath it not often hapned in the World, that ſuch
a mighty Scrupuloſity about our Duty hath proved a very
ſucceſsful way of growing great or raiſing an Eſtate, by
giving Men ſo fair an opportunity of impoſing upon the
credulous and unwary? So that I have known it adviſed as
an uſeful caution to thoſe that would live in the World,
always to ſtand upon your Guard and look to your Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,
when you deal with thoſe who pretend to greater
Tenderneſs and Exactneſs than other undoubtedly ſober
and honeſt Chriſtians generally do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:54114:9"/>
3. Where Perſons are truly honeſt and mean well, there
is nothing more troubleſom and vexatious than ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
Scruples about things lawful. This muſt needs
be an intolerable diſturbance to a Man's Mind, and breed
great Anxiety and Inquietude, when Perſons are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſhivering and trembling leſt by every thing they do
they incur the Divine Diſpleaſure; and it certainly diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
a man from performing his neceſſary Duty. He is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to make but a ſlow Progreſs in his Journey, who inſtead
of going on cheerfully in his way, is frequently at a ſtand,
doubting which Foot he ſhould ſet forward, or what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Path he ſhould chooſe. This robs men, in a great
meaſure, of that Peace and Satisfaction which they might
otherwiſe find in Religion, whilſt they are daily perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves with untying Knots which themſelves only
have faſtned. Scruples about things indifferent, when
once we attend to and entertain them, like the Plague of
Flies amongſt the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> will be conſtantly buzzing in
our Ears, and tormenting us with their Impertinency; till
at length we come to diſtruſt every thing, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that belongs to ordinary civility, no recreation we
can uſe, no cloaths we can wear, no diſcourſe we can hold
with others, no converſation we can maintain, or buſineſs
which we tranſact in the World, but we ſhall raiſe ſome
trifling Objections or Scruples about it, which will make
our Condition continually uneaſie and reſtleſs. For,</p>
            <p>4. Theſe Scruples are infinite and endleſs: for, being
grounded upon ſome very little and inconſiderable Reaſon,
there is hardly any thing to be done but ſome ſmall Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may be ſtarted againſt it, which may ſoon puzzle and
confound the more ignorant ſort of Chriſtians. Thus he
that ſcruples a Miniſter's officiating in a white Garment,
may eaſily be brought to doubt of the fitneſs of his doing
it in black, and then he proceeds againſt any ſolemn di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Habit, and at laſt againſt the Office of Miniſters it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54114:10"/>
ſelf, and tells you all Gods People are holy, and that all
Chriſtians are a Royal Prieſt-hood, and we have no need
of Teachers, for we are all taught of God. From ſcrupling
the Sign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> after Baptiſm, Men have ſoon come
to queſtion Infant Baptiſm it ſelf: they have at firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
diſliked only ſome ſignificant Ceremonies in God's
Worſhip, of Humane appointment, but thence they have
gone on to deny all outward bodily Reverence, and
thought it not expedient to pull off their Hats in Church,
then not to do it before Magiſtrates, at laſt not at all: and
thus by giving place to ſuch little Scruples, they become
afraid of ſpeaking, looking, or doing any thing like other
Men.</p>
            <p>This is notorious amongſt us. Thoſe who have taken
Offence at ſome things in our Church and have thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſeparated from us, and aſſociated themſelves with a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
Congregation, have ſoon diſliked ſomething amongſt
them alſo, and then they would reform themſelves farther,
and after that refine themſelves more ſtill, till at laſt they
have ſunk down either into Quakeriſm, Popery, or Atheiſm.
This doth not only now and then happen in the World,
but is the probable effect of embracing and cheriſhing ſuch
Scruples, that men go on ſcrupling one thing after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
till at length they doubt of every thing.</p>
            <p>5. Laſtly, This needleſs ſcrupling of lawful things hath
done unſpeakable Miſchief to the Church of Chriſt, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to the Reformed <hi>Church of England;</hi> a Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
according to the moſt Primitive and Apoſtolical
Pattern, by the beſt and wiſeſt Rules, in which even by
the confeſſion of the ſobereſt and moſt conſiderable of our
Diſſenters nothing is required, as a condition of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that is ſinful; yet how is ſhe rent and torn, mangled
and divided, how hath ſhe been aſſaulted, undermined,
and in danger to be the ſecond time overthrown upon the
account only of Habits and Geſtures, and particular Forms,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54114:10"/>
Rites, and Modes of Diſcipline and Worſhip, with which
ſome Men are not well ſatisfied or pleaſed, which they
judge might be better done and ordered another way, or
which they rather would have left at liberty, that every
Man may do therein according to his own Diſcretion or
Opinion.</p>
            <p>In the great and neceſſary Truths of Religion we all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
to be agreed. We all worſhip the ſame God, believe
in the ſame Lord and Saviour, have the ſame Baptiſm, the
ſame Faith, the ſame Hope, the ſame common Intereſt, our
Sacraments, as to the main are rightly adminiſtred accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our Saviours Inſtitution, our Churches are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be true Churches of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> but there are
ſome Conſtitutions, which reſpect chiefly outward Order
and the decent performance of Divine Worſhip, againſt
which men have received ſtrange Prejudices, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of them have raiſed a mighty noiſe and clamour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Church, and have openly ſeparated from its
Communion, as if by renouncing of Popery we had only
exchanged one idolatrous Service for another. About theſe
skirts and borders, the dreſs and circumſtances of Religion
hath been all our quarrelling and contention; and theſe
Differences have proceeded to ſuch an height, as to beget
immortal Feuds and Animoſities, to break and crumble us
into little Parties and Fractions, whereby mutual Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his hindred, our common Religion ſuffers Reproach, the
Enemies of it are ſtrengthned and encouraged, publick
Peace endangered, and brotherly Love, the Badge of
Chriſt's Diſciples, quite loſt amongſt us: and the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of theſe miſerable Diſtractions amongſt us upon ſuch
frivolous Accounts, (if compared with the Intereſts of
Peace and Charity) is a matter of ſad conſideration to all
lively Members of Chriſt's Body, and forebodes great evils
impendent over our Church and State. I doubt not to ſay,
that the Devil hath fought more ſucceſsfully againſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54114:11"/>
under the mark of a zealous Reformer, than under
any other diſguiſe whatever.</p>
            <p>The grand Enemy of mankind hath by various ways and
means all along contriv'd, and endeavoured to defeat the
deſigns of Heaven for the good and happineſs of men:
and as the divine Wiſdom hath in ſeveral ages of the World
manifeſted it ſelf for the encouraging and promoting of
true Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, ſo hath the Devil always
been at work to oppoſe what he could find moſt proper
for the hindring the good effect of Gods Kindneſs towards
us. When the fullneſs of time came, by the appearance of
the Son of God in the World, he was in a great meaſure
dethroned, his Kingdom overthrown, and the laſt and moſt
effectual means, were uſed for the recovery of men out of
his ſnare and power. When therefore he perceived that by all
the grievous Perſecutions he raiſed againſt the Church, it
ſpread only ſo much the faſter, that at laſt the whole Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Idolatry fell down before the Croſs of Chriſt; when
he was ſhamefully expelled out of his Temples, and from
his Altars, his Oracles ſilenced, and the Religion of Jeſus
prevailed every where; He then betook himſelf to his old.
Serpentine Arts of diſſimulation. Since he could no longer
oppoſe Chriſts Kingdom by open war, he reſolved to turn
Chriſtian, and to ſet up for Chriſts Deputy, and ſubſtitute
here on Earth, to fight againſt Chriſtians under Chriſts
Banner, and by adulterating and corrupting the Chriſtian
Doctrine, to ſpoil it of all its Efficacy, to introduce his
old Heathen Rites and Idolatrous Ceremonies, as unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
traditions from Chriſt himſelf or his Apoſtles, and ſo
under his Name and pretended Authority to exerciſe all that
cruelty, oppreſſion, and fraud, which is ſo pleaſing to his own
infernal nature, hoping to burn, deſtroy, root out all true
Chriſtians from the face of the Earth, under colour of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating
the Catholick Faith, and inlarging Chriſts Kingdom
in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:54114:11"/>
When <hi>Christendom</hi> had long groaned under this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Tyranny, it pleaſed God in many places of <hi>Europe,</hi> but
eſpecially here in <hi>England,</hi> to ſet on foot a Reformation
of Religion, which was happily and peaceably accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
among us by the favour and countenance of publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and the wiſe Counſel and Advice of our Reverend
Biſhops and other Miniſters. To nip this in the Bud the
Devil raiſed that ſharp Perſecution in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days,
in which our firſt Reformers gloriouſly ſealed what they
had done with their Blood: but this proving ineffectual,
that he might the better fruſtrate the ends of our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
himſelf would turn Reformer too; A great cry was
ſoon raiſed againſt our Church, as not ſufficiently purged
from Popery, our Biſhops, our Prayers, our Ceremonies
were all Antichriſtian, and it was not long before all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
Tythes, Temples, and the Univerſities too, were
condemned as ſuch, and God knows they had well nigh
reformed away all Learning, true Religion, and Worſhip
of God, and under the ſpecious Pretence of paring off all
Superfluities, had grievouſly ſhaken the Foundations of
Chriſtianity it ſelf; inſomuch, that it came to paſs, as ſome
of thoſe who now diſſent from us did then camplain, That
<hi>Profeſſors of Religion did openly oppoſe and deride almost all
that Service of God out of Conſcience, which other men uſed
to do out of Prophaneneſs.</hi> And what infinte miſchief this
raſh and intemperate Zeal for reforming abuſes and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
hath done to our Church and Nation, if the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of this laſt age will not ſufficiently convince men,
it is not to be hoped that any Diſcourſe ſhould. We lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
conſider whoſe Intereſt we thus ſerve and promote: we
do his work who is moſt delighted with Srife and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
and every one can tell who that is, and where he
reigns. To be ſure by theſe uncharitable Separations we
highly gratifie the common Eenemy, whoſe great Deſign
and Policy it hath all along been, by the Follies and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54114:12"/>
Scruples of Proteſtant Diſſenters to weaken, and
by degrees pull down the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and then we
all become an become an eaſie Prey to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any now tell me, that to prevent this great Miſchief
and Danger that ariſeth from our Diviſions, it is not ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that the People ſhould lay down their Scruples,
(which they cannot well do, ſince no one can at any time
think or believe as he will,) as it is that the Impoſitions
themſelves, the matters ſcrupled at, ſhould be removed
and taken away, and then Peace and Unity may be better
ſecured. To this I only anſwer theſe two things.</p>
            <p>1. I now conſider things as they at preſent ſtand amongſt
us. We have a Church ſetled and eſtabliſhed by Law, in
which nothing that is ſinful is enjoyned. What the Duty
of our Governours and Superiours is, how far they may or
ought to condeſcend to the Weakneſs or Scruples of others,
I ſhall not take upon me to determine; that is another
Queſtion which belongs not to us. But I conſider now on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what private Members of ſuch a Church are to do, and
then I ſay, ſcrupling the Uſe of ſome things preſcribed by
the Church, will not juſtifie our leaving it; nay, as I ſhall
ſhew afterwards, it is our beſt and ſafeſt courſe to ſubmit
and comply with ſuch Orders notwithſtanding our Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
But I add,</p>
            <p>2. If this were a ſufficient Reaſon why the Conſtitution
of any Church ſhould be altered, becauſe ſome things are
ſcrupled in it, there never could be a ſetled Church as long
as the World ſtands: for, ſince there will be always a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in Mens Underſtandings and Tempers, ſome weak
and injudicious, others peeviſh and proud, there will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
be many that ſhall ſcruple and be offended at the
beſt and moſt innocent Conſtitutions. And if the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
now in uſe amongſt us had not been retained at our
firſt Reformation, thoſe very Perſons, who are now ſo
much diſſatisfied with the Impoſition of them, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54114:12"/>
have been the firſt that ſhould have then complained
of the want of them. Of which we have this notorious
and undeniable Evidence in the late times, when our
Church was laid in the Duſt, when none of thoſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
or Forms which are now objected againſt were impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
or commonly uſed, yet even then were men gathering
Congregations out of Congregations, purifying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
ſtill further; Scruples encreaſed, Sects and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
upon them multiplied, and never ſuch Diſtractions
and Confuſions in Religion as in thoſe days, and without
the gift of Prophecy one may foretell that, if what is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
found fault with in our Church was now aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet thoſe that are given to Scruples would at leaſt in
time find cavilling Objections againſt any Conſtitution
that can be made. They are like Men given to ſue and
go to Law. They never want ſome pretence to diſturb
themſelves and their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>Men may talk of reconciling our Differences, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up our Breaches to their Lives end, and propound
their ſeveral Projects, and frame their Models, and conceive
fine deſigns of Union and Accommodation, yet none of
theſe will have any effect or do any good, till men learn
Humility and Modeſty, and be contented to be governed
by others in things indifferent, till Self-conceit and Pride
be in ſome meaſure rooted out, and when this is effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done, there will then be found but little need of any
alteration in the preſent Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>The foundation of our Peace and Agreement muſt be laid
in the reforming our ſelves and our own Tempers. The
way to unite us lieth not ſo much in amending the preſent
Eſtabliſhment, Government, Liturgy, endeavouring to add
to it, or leave out of it, till all Parties amongſt us are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
(which indeed can never be effected) as it doth
conſiſt in our becoming more truly Chriſtian in our Lives
and Tempers. They are our vicious Diſpoſitions, more
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54114:13"/>
than our different Apprehenſions, that keep us at ſuch a
diſtance. Let the terms of Communion with the Church
be what they will, yet as long as Men retain the ſame
quarrelſom Mind, and induſtriouſly ſeek for Doubts and
Scruples, and are glad to find them, and prefer their own
private Opinion and Judgment before the Wiſdom and
Authority of all their Governours, whether Civil or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical,
it is plain our Diviſions and Animoſities will
not, cannot ceaſe.</p>
            <p>But this leads me to the laſt thing I deſign'd to diſcourſe
of; which was, to propound to you the beſt ways and
means by which men may get rid of and eaſe their Minds
of ſuch Scruples; where I ſhall eſpecially conſider thoſe
that relate to our communicating with our Pariſh-Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.
You muſt not expect that I ſhould deſcend to, and
anſwer the particular Exceptions which hinder men from
conſtant Communion with us; but only in general I ſhall
crave leave to adviſe you ſome few things, which would
mightily tend to the removing thoſe Doubts and Scruples
that yet detain ſo many in a ſtate of utter Separation from
us, or at leaſt diſcourage their total and hearty joyning
with us. Which charitable Deſign and Attempt, however
unſucceſsful I may be in it, yet cannot, I hope, be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to any, whoſe Conſciences are peſter'd with ſuch
Scruples, ſince I endeavour only to deliver them from thoſe
Miſtakes, which beſide the diſſervice they do to Religion
and the Proteſtant Intereſt, do alſo expoſe them to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and danger from the Publick Laws and Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.
Of many Rules that might be given in this caſe, I
ſhall inſiſt only on theſe following.</p>
            <p>1. We ſhould take great care to beget and cheriſh in
our Minds the moſt high, and worthy, and honourable
Thoughts of God Almighty. This is the Foundation of all
Religion; and as our Apprehenſions of God are, ſuch for
the moſt part will be his Worſhip and Service. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54114:13"/>
as we conceive of his Nature, ſo ſhall we judge what
things are moſt pleaſing to him, as alſo what they are that
are moſt offenſive and diſtaſtful to him.</p>
            <p>Now conſider, I beſeech you, Can that Man have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
and excellent Thoughts of the Divine Nature, who
imagines that God regards any particular Geſtures, Habits,
and Poſtures ſo far, as that the acceptance of our Service
and Worſhip ſhould depend upon ſuch Circumſtances of
our religious Actions? When with all Humility and true
Devotion of Heart a ſincere Chriſtian proſtrates himſelf at
the Throne of God's Grace, and with earneſt Deſire and
Affections begs thoſe good things that are according to Gods
Mind and Will, Can we believe that the Father of our
Spirits ſhall refuſe and reject his Petition becauſe it is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in a certain preſcribed form of Words? Shall his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
renewed Requeſts fail of Succeſs becauſe he ſtill
uſeth the ſame Expreſſions, and reads his Prayers out of a
Book? Is God pleaſed with variety of Words? or the copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of our Invention, or the elegancy of our Phraſe and
Stile? Is it not the Heart and inward frame of Spirit that
God principally reſpects in all our Prayers? Or can we
think ſo meanly of God, that he ſhould ſhut his ears againſt
the united Prayers of his People, becauſe offended at the
colour of the Garment in which the Miniſter officiates?</p>
            <p>Suppoſe two Perſons, both with equal Preparation, with
true Repentance and Faith to approach the Lord's Table;
one of them out of a deep ſenſe of his Unworthineſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſo great Bleſſings, and out of a grateful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Benefits therein conferr'd upon him, takes the
Sacrament upon his Knees, in the humbleſt Poſture; the
other ſitting or ſtanding. Can you think that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is effectual or beneficial, or that God bleſſes it only
to him that ſits, or that it would not have been of the ſame
advantage to him if he alſo had received it kneeling? To
ſurmiſe any ſuch thing, is ſurely to diſhonour God, as if
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54114:14"/>
he were a low poor humourſome Being, like a Father that
ſhould diſinherit his Child tho in all Reſpects moſt duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to him, and every way deſerving his greateſt Kindneſs,
only becauſe he did not like his Complexion, or the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of his Hair. The wiſer and greater any Perſon is to
whom we addreſs our ſelves, the leſs he will ſtand upon
little Punctilio's.</p>
            <p>Under the Jewiſh Law the minuteſt circumſtances of
Worſhip were exactly deſcribed and determined by God
himſelf, and it was not ordinarily lawful for the People at
all to vary from them. But it was neceſſary then that it
ſhould be thus: becauſe the Jewiſh Worſhip was typical
of what was to come hereafter, and thoſe many nice Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances
that were appointed were not commanded for
themſelves, as if there were any excellency in them, but
they were ſhadows of things to come, which are all now
done away by the Goſpel, and the bringing in of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Righteouſneſs, the only thing always pleaſing to
God and agreeable to his Nature: It is a ſpiritual rational
Service God now expects from us, and delights in, and
he muſt look upon God as a very fond and captious Being,
who can perſwade himſelf that our Prayers and Thanſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
and other Acts of Worſhip, tho we be moſt hearty
and devout in them, yet ſhall be rejected by him only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of ſome particular Habits or Geſtures we uſed, which
were neither diſhonourable to God, nor unſutable to the
nature of thoſe religious Performances.</p>
            <p>Such mean Thoughts of God are the true ground of all
Superſtition, when we think to court and pleaſe him by
making great Conſcience about little things; and ſo it hath
been truly obſerved, that there is far more Superſtition
in conſcientious abſtaining from that which God hath no
where forbid, than there is in doing that which God hath
not commanded. A man may certainly do what God hath
not commanded, and yet never think to flatter God by it,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54114:14"/>
nor place any Religion in it, but he may do it only out
of obedience to his Superiours, for outward Order and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
for which end our Ceremonies are appointed, and
ſo there is no Superſtition in them. But now a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nout
out of Conſcience refuſe to do what God hath not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid,
and is by lawful Authority, required of him, but he
muſt think to pleaſe God by ſuch abſtaining: and in this
conceit of pleaſing or humouring God by indifferent things,
conſiſts the true Spirit of Superſtition. Have great and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Thoughts of God, and behold, <hi>all theſe things will
be clean to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. (Which is the particular Rule of my Text) Lay out
your great care and zeal about the neceſſary and ſubſtantial
duties of Religion, and this will make you leſs concerned
about things of an inferiour and indifferent Nature. As on
the one hand our fierce Diſputes and Debates about little
things and circumſtances are apt to eat out the Heart and
Life of Religion, ſo on the other ſide, minding thoſe things
moſt, in which the Power of Religion doth conſiſt, is the
beſt way to cure our Scrupulouſneſs about little things.
This was the Apoſtle's Advice to the <hi>Romans, cap.</hi> 14.
amongſt whom eating or not eating ſome Meats, obſerving
or not obſerving ſome days, had occaſioned as much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Scruple as forms of Prayer and Ceremonies do now
amongſt us, <hi>ver. 17. The Kingdom of God is not Meat or
Drink, but Righteouſneſs, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
What needs all this Stir and Buſtle? This cenſuring, diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and dividing about Standing or Kneeling, theſe are
not the great matters of our Faith; they are not worth
ſo much Noiſe and Contention. The great ſtreſs and
weight in our Religion is laid upon the Duties of a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
and holy Life, and a peaceable Spirit and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and then he adds, <hi>ver. 18. For he that in theſe things
ſerveth Chriſt is acceptable to God and approved of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:54114:15"/>
Thus when you betake your ſelves to your Prayers, let
it be your greateſt care to fix in your Minds a due ſenſe of
God's Infinite Majeſty, of your own Vileneſs and Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs,
of your manifold Wants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Neceſſities, and the
greatneſs and goodneſs of the things you petition for, and
his readineſs to grant them upon your humble Requeſt;
and the more you do this, the leſs ſollicitous you will be
about the form or words of your Prayers. He that minds
thoſe things moſt on which the efficacy of his Prayers for
Chriſt's ſake doth depend, will not ſtand in need of, nor
require new Phraſes every time to ſtir his Attention or to
raiſe his Affection. Thus let Men be very diligent and
conſcientious in preparing themſelves for the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion;
let them come thereunto with lively apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Chriſts Love in dying for us, with hearty Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Amendment, and true Charity towards all Men; the
more concerned they are about theſe neceſſary things, the
leſs afraid will they be of offending God by kneeling at
the Adminiſtration, or coming up to receive it in one part
of the Church rather than another: for, they will find that
they are quite other things in which true Religion conſiſts,
in a new Nature, in a divine temper of Mind, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Practiſe of Holineſs, Righteouſneſs, and Charity;
which make a Man really better, and more like unto
God.</p>
            <p>He that places any Religion in not putting off his Hat,
or ſitting at the Sacrament, or not ſtanding up at the
Creed or Goſpel, as I before ſhew'd you, hath no worthy
Thoughts of God; ſo neither hath he any right Notion of
Chriſtianity, which conſiſts only in unfeigned Piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, and ſincere Love to our Brother, not in any
external Rites or Obſervances, which are in their own
Nature variable and mutable, and are different in ſeveral
Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:54114:15"/>
3. It would greatly contribute to the removing theſe
Scruples which hinder the bleſſed Union of Chriſtians
amongſt us, if men were but really willing to receive ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
This alone would go half way towards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
them. But when they are grown fond of and
nouriſh their Doubts and Prejudices, and converſe only
with thoſe Men, read only thoſe Books, and hear thoſe
Diſcourſes which are made of their ſide, which ſerve to
heighten and ſtrengthen their Jealouſies and Suſpicions,
when they avoid the means of Conviction as dangerous
Snares and Temptations, and look upon this tenderneſs or
aptneſs to be offended, as a ſign of Grace and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Conſcientiouſneſs, there can be but little hopes of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
ſuch Perſons to a right apprehenſion of things.
Whereas would they come once to diſtruſt their own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to ſuppoſe that they may perhaps be all this while
miſtaken, would they calmly and patiently hear, faithfully
and impartially conſider what is ſaid or wrote againſt them,
as eagerly deſire and ſeek for ſatisfaction as Men do for
cure of any Diſeaſe they are ſubject unto; would they, I
ſay, thus diligently uſe all fit means and helps for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
of their Scruples, before they troubled the Church
of Chriſt with them, it would not prove ſo very difficult
a Task to convince and ſettle ſuch teachable Minds.</p>
            <p>If therefore any Man be poſſeſſed with Doubts or Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
againſt any thing practiſed or required in our Church,
let him firſt read ſome of thoſe excellent Books, that are
written with all the fairneſs and evidence imaginable, on
purpoſe to explain and juſtifie thoſe things that are moſt
uſually excepted againſt; let him conſult with ſome of our
Church before he leaves it. Let him honeſtly repair to the
Miniſter of his Pariſh, or ſome other whom he hath in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
eſtimation, and ingeniouſly open his Mind to him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
what it is he moſt ſtumbles at, and hear what can
be offered for the Reſolution of his Doubts. If conſulting
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54114:16"/>
with one Perſon will not do it, let him adviſe with others,
and try this often, before he condemns us, and divides from
us. Would men do this ſeriouſly, with earneſt deſire of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
without doubt we ſhould have far fewer Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,
and they who after this did ſtill diſſent from us, would
be far more excuſable in it, than otherwiſe they are, and
this is no other than what men ordinarily do in their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
affairs. When they have any fear or ſuſpition about
their worldly concerns, they preſently repair to thoſe who
are beſt skill'd, and moſt able to reſolve them, and in their
judgment and determination they commonly acquieſce and
ſatisfie themſelves. Hath any man a ſcruple about his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
whether it be firmly ſetled, or he hath a true legal
Title to it? The way he takes for ſatisfaction is to adviſe
with Lawyers, the moſt eminent for Knowledge and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
in their profeſſion. If they agree in the ſame opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
this is the greateſt aſſurance he can have that it is right
and ſafe. Thus is it with one that doubts whether ſuch a
cuſtom or practiſe be for his health, the opinion of known
and experienced Phyſitians is the only proper means to
determine him in ſuch a caſe. The reaſon is the ſame here.
When any private Chriſtian is troubled and perplexed with
fears and ſcruples that concern his Duty, or the Worſhip
of God, he ought in the firſt place to have recourſe to the
Publick Guides and Miniſters of Religion, who are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God, and are beſt fitted to direct and conduct him;
I ſay, to come to them, not only to diſpute and argue with
them, and pertly to oppoſe them, but with all modeſty to
propound their doubts, meekly to hearken to and receive
Inſtruction, humbly begging of God to open their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings
that they may ſee and embraſe the truth, taking
great care that no evil affection, love of a Party or carnal
intereſt influence or byaſs their Judgments.</p>
            <p>Who do not by this deſire men to pin their faith upon the
Prieſts Sleeve, or to put out their own eyes that they might
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54114:16"/>
be better guided and managed by them; but only diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to attend to their Reaſons and Arguments, and to give
ſome due regard and deference to their Authority: for it
is not ſo abſurd, as may by ſome be imagined, for the
Common People to take upon truſt from their lawful
Teachers, what they are not competent Judges of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>But the difficulty here is, how ſhall a private Chriſtian
govern himſelf, when the very Guides and Miniſters of
Religion determine differently concerning theſe matters in
queſtion amongſt us? Some warranting and allowing them,
others as much diſapproving and condemning them: by what
Rule ſhall he chooſe his Guide? To which I briefly reply;</p>
            <p>1. As for thoſe who ſcruple at Conformity, and are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably
to judge for themſelves, let not ſuch relye
barely upon the Authority either of the one or the other.
All we deſire of them is, that they would equally hear
both ſides, that they would think that the Miniſters of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> have ſome Senſe and Conſcience too as
well as other Men, and are able to ſay ſomewhat for what
they do themſelves, or require of others; that laying aſide
all Prejudices, Favour to or admiration of Mens Perſons,
they would weigh and conſider the Arguments that may
be propounded to them, being diffident of their own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions,
and indifferent to either part of the Queſtion;
that they would think it no ſhame to change their Mind
when they ſee good reaſon for it. Could we thus prevail
with the People diligently to examine the Merits of the
cauſe, our Church would every day gain more Ground
amongſt all wiſe Men: for we care not how much Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Underſtanding our People have, ſo they be but
humble and modeſt with it, nor do we deſire Men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
our Proſelytes any further than we give them good
Scripture and Reaſon for it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:54114:17"/>
2. But as for thoſe who are not ſo capable of examining
or judging for themſelves (as few of the common People
who ſeparate from us really are; they not being able to
give any tolerable account of their diſſent from us, only in
general Words declaiming againſt Popery, Superſtition,
Antichriſtian and Unſcriptural Ceremonies, Humane Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) ſuch had better truſt to and depend on thoſe
Miniſters, of known Sufficiency for their Office, who are
regularly and by the Laws of the Land ſet over them, than
any other Guides or Teachers that they can chooſe for
themſelves. This to be ſure is the ſafer courſe, which in
doubtful caſes is always to be taken. I ſpeak now of theſe
preſent Controverſies about Forms and Ceremonies ſo hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agitated amongſt us, which are above the Sphere of
common People, out of their profeſſion; not of ſuch
things as concern the Salvation of all men, which are plain
and evident to the meaneſt Capacities. When therefore
in ſuch caſes, about which we cannot eaſily ſatisfie our
ſelves, we follow the Advice of the publickly authorized
Guides and Preachers of Religion, if they chance to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead
us, we have ſomething to ſay or apologize for our
ſelves. Our Error is more excuſable and pardonable, as
being occaſion'd by thoſe, to whoſe Judgment, by God's
Command, we did owe a great Reſpect and Submiſſion.
But when we chooſe Inſtructors and Counſellors to our
ſelves according to our own fancy and liking, and they
teach us contrary to the Doctrine of our lawful Miniſters,
if then we prove to be in the wrong, and are betray'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Sin, we may thank our own Wantonneſs for it, and are
more ſeverely accomptable for ſuch Miſtakes.</p>
            <p>Thus let a man that is troubled with any threatning diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
apply himſelf rather to the Licenſed Phiſicians or Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions,
of approved Skill and Honeſty; and if he chance
to miſcarry under them, yet he hath this contentment, that
he uſed the beſt and wiſeſt means for his Health and Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54114:17"/>
But if he leaves them all, and will hearken only to
<hi>Quacks</hi> and <hi>Empiricks,</hi> tho they adviſe him quite contrary
to what the others preſcribed, if under their hands he
grows worſe and worſe, he muſt then charge his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
Folly or idle Humour, as the cauſe of his Ruine.</p>
            <p>4. In order to the curing of our Scruples we ſhould
thoroughly underſtand and conſider, what is the true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of lawful, and how it differs from what is neceſſary,
and from what is ſinful. That is neceſſary or our Duty
which God hath expreſly commanded, that is ſinful which
God hath forbid; that is lawful which God hath not by
any Law obliging us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either commanded or forbid: for,
<hi>Where there is no Law,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>there is no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
Rom.</hi> 4. 15. There can be no Tranſgreſſion, but
either omitting what the Law commands, or doing what
the Law forbids. For inſtance, If any man can ſhew where
kneeling at the Sacrament is forbid in Scripture, where ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
is required; where praying by a form is forbid, and
extemporary Prayers are enjoyned, then indeed the Diſpute
would ſoon be at an end: but if neither the one, nor the
other can be found, as moſt certainly they cannot, then
kneeling at the Sacrament, and reading Prayers out of a
Book, muſt be reckoned amongſt things lawful. And then
there is no need of ſcrupling them, becauſe they may be
done without Sin: nay, where they are required by our
Superiours, it is our duty to ſubmit to them, becauſe it is
our Duty to obey them in all lawful things.</p>
            <p>This way of arguing is very plain and convincing, and
cannot be evaded but by giving another Notion of Lawful.
And therefore it is commonly ſaid, that nothing is lawful,
eſpecially in the Worſhip of God, which God himſelf hath
not preſcribed and appointed, or that hath been abuſed to
evil Purpoſes. And on theſe two Miſtakes are chiefly
grounded Mens Scruples about indifferent Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
in God's Worſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:54114:18"/>
1. That only is ſaid to be lawful in God's Worſhip
which he himſelf hath preſcribed and appointed; ſo that
this is thought exception ſufficient againſt the Forms and
Uſages of our Church, that though they are not forbid,
yet they are no where commanded in Scripture. <hi>Who hath
required theſe things at your hands?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here I only ask, Where our Saviour or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
have forbid us doing any thing in God's Worſhip,
which is not by himſelf commanded, or where in the New
Teſtament we are told, that God will be angry with us for
doing any thing which he hath no where forbid, either by
general or particular Laws? For unleſs this can be ſhewn,
there can be no colour for this Pretence, and we are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
ſure, that no ſuch place can be produced out of the
Bible. It is acknowledged by all, that the Holy Scriptures,
as to all that is neceſſary to be believed or done in order
to Salvation, as to all the eſſential and ſubſtantial parts of
Divine Worſhip, is a plain and perfect Rule; but it is as
certain that the outward circumſtances of Time, Place, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
and Geſture, are not determined in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as they were by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law: and yet God cannot
be, at leaſt viſibly and publickly, worſhipped without
them. If therefore theſe be not determined in Scripture,
and it is unlawful to do any thing in Gods Worſhip but
what is ſo determined, it follows that God cannot be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
at all, unleſs we could worſhip him in no Time,
Place, Habit, or Geſture: nor indeed can I learn how a
Chriſtian can, with a good Conſcience, perform any part
of God's Worſhip, if this Principle be admitted for true,
that whatſoever is not commanded is forbid, ſince the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Circumſtances of religious Actions, without which
they cannot be performed, are not preſcribed or determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in Scripture; and ſo he muſt commit a Sin every time
he prays or receives the Holy Sacrament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:54114:18"/>
Beſides, this Reaſon would oblige us to ſeparate from
all the Churches that ever were or are in the World, there
being no conſtituted Church in which there are not ſome
Orders and Injunctions for the regulating the publick
Worſhip of God no where commanded in Scripture. We
could never, upon this Principle, have held Communion
with the Primitive Churches, which undoubtedly had their
inſtituted ſignificant Ceremonies; nor is there any Church
at this day, that hath not by its own Authority determined
ſome of the circumſtances of Divine Service for the more
decent and orderly performance thereof. Nay, thoſe very
Perſons that make this Exception, do themſelves practiſe
many things in the Worſhip of God, without the leaſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of a Divine Command, to which they oblige their
Hearers and Communicants: for, conceived Prayers, ſitting
at the Euchariſt, ſprinkling the Infant at Baptiſm, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter's
officiating in a black Cloak or Coat, are full out as
unſcriptural, humane, uncommanded as any Geſture, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
or Form uſed in our Church.</p>
            <p>2. That is ſaid to be unlawful which hath been abuſed
to ſinful Purpoſes, to Idolatry or Superſtition; ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ought to be retained in our Worſhip, tho it be not
forbid by God, which was uſed in times of Popery. Hence
the ordinary Objection againſt our Pariſh Churches is, that
they are not ſufficiently purged from Popery; that our
firſt Reformers were indeed excellent and worthy Perſons
for the Times they lived in; that what they did was very
commendable and a good Beginning, but they were forced
to comply with the neceſſities of the Age, which would
not bear a compleat Reformation. They left a great deal
of <hi>Popiſh</hi> Traſh in the Church, hoping by degrees to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
the Papiſts to it, or at leaſt that they might not
make the Breach too wide, and too much prejudice or
eſtrange them from it. But we now live under better
means, have greater Light and Knowledge, and ſo a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54114:19"/>
and more perfect Amendment is now neceſſary. Thus
the Order of Biſhops is decried as Popiſh and Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
our Liturgy as taken out of the Maſs Book, and our
Ceremonies as Relicks of Idolatry.</p>
            <p>But the truth of the caſe is this. We muſt conſider, that
thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do hold and maintain all the
Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, but then by degrees, as they
found opportunity, they have added a number of impious
and pernicious Doctrines to the Chriſtian Faith, the Belief
and Profeſſion of which they equally require of all that are
in their Communion. Beſides this, they have introduced
ſeveral idolatrous and ſuperſtitious Rites and Practiſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Service of their Church, never heard of for the firſt
four hundred Years, by which they have miſerably defaced
and corrupted the Worſhip of God, and made it neceſſary
for all thoſe that love their own Salvation, to ſeparate
from them. Now our firſt Reformers here in <hi>England</hi> did
not go about to invent a new Species of Government, to
deviſe new Rites and Ceremonies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a new form of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
ſuch as ſhould be leaſt excepted againſt, and then
obtrude it upon this Nation, as was done at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and
ſome other places; but they wiſely conſidered, that if they
did but reject what the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> had added to the Faith
and Worſhip of Chriſtians, lay aſide their novel Inventions,
Uſurpations, and unwritten Traditions, there would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
the pure, ſimple, Primitive Chriſtianity, ſuch as it
was before the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was thus degenerated: nor
have we any thing of Popery left amongſt us, but what the
Papiſts had left amongſt them of Primitive Religion and
Worſhip.</p>
            <p>As we muſt not receive the evil for the ſake of the good,
ſo neither muſt we reject the good for the ſake of the evil.
In our Church we pray neither to Saints nor Angels, nor
the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> our Liturgy is in a known Tongue, we
deny the Laity no part of the Sacrament, nor the reading of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54114:19"/>
the Scriptures, we offer no Maſs ſacrifice, nor worſhip Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
or the conſecrated Bread. We have not one Doctrine
or Ceremony in uſe amongſt us, that is purely Popiſh. But
we muſt be obliged to part with the moſt ſacred, venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and uſefulleſt things in our Religion, if this be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
reaſon of our forbearing any thing, becauſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
abuſe it.</p>
            <p>This therefore I conclude to be the beſt and plaineſt
rule for the governing of our Conſciences, not wilfully to
omit any thing that God hath commanded, to avoid to
the utmoſt of our Power what God hath forbid; and what
ever elſe we have no particular Divine Law about, to guide
our ſelves by the general rules of Scripture, the commands
of our Superiours, and by the meaſures of Prudence, Peace,
and Charity. This one rule (and it cannot but ſeem a very
reaſonable one) would ſoon put an end to our ſquabbles
and janglings about Formes and Ceremonies and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
things.</p>
            <p>5. In order to the bringing men to a complyance with
the Laws of our Church, we muſt deſire them to conſider
that there never was nor ever will be any publick Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
that will be every way unexceptionable. The beſt
policy, whether Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, that can be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
will have ſome flaws and defects, which muſt be
borne and tolerated. Some inconveniences will in proceſs
of time ariſe, that never could be foreſeen or provided
againſt; and to make alteration upon every emergent diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
may be often of worſe conſequence, than the evil we
pretend to cure by it. Let the rules and modes of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Diſcipline, publick Worſhip, be moſt exact and
blameleſs, yet there will be faults in Governours and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
as long as they are but men. We muſt not expect
in this World a Church without Spot or Wrinkle, that
conſiſts only of Saints, in which nothing can be found
amiſs; eſpecially by thoſe who lye at the catch and wait
for an advantage againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:54114:20"/>
If men will ſcruple and reform, as long as any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
which they can object againſt, they muſt e'en come
at laſt, as a Reverend Perſon of our Church hath obſerved,
to the ſtate of that miſerable Man who left all humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
that he might not be defiled with other Mens Sins,
and at laſt cut out the Contents of Chapters and Titles of
Books out of the Bible, becauſe they were humane Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
added to the pure Word of God. Men muſt be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
if ever they would promote Peace and Unity, to put
candid Conſtructions and favourable Interpretations upon
things, to take them by the beſt handle, and not ſtrain
things on purpoſe that they might cavil the more plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and raiſe more conſiderable Objections againſt them.
We muſt not make perſonal, accidental Faults, nor any
thing a pretence for our leaving the Communion of our
Church, which ariſeth only from the neceſſary condition
and temper of all humane Affairs, that nothing here is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
perfect.</p>
            <p>6. And laſtly, If you cannot by theſe, and other the like
conſiderations, not now to be mentioned, get rid of, and
conquer your Scruples, then be adviſed to lay them aſide,
to throw them out of your Minds as dangerous Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and act poſitively againſt them.</p>
            <p>But here I eaſily imagine ſome ready preſently to ask me,
Do you perſwade us to conform to the Orders of the
Church tho we are not ſatisfied in our Minds concerning
them? I anſwer, That I think this the beſt Advice that can
be given to ſuch ſcrupulous Perſons. It would be an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
infinite thing, and Communion with any Church
would be altogether unpracticable, if every private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
was obliged to ſuſpend joyning himſelf to it, till he
was perfectly ſatisfied about the reaſonableneſs and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of all that was required, or was in uſe in that Church:
for indeed, private Perſons are by no means proper Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of what is fit and convenient in the Adminiſtration of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54114:20"/>
Church-Government, Diſcipline, or publick Worſhip, no
more than they are of matters of State, or the Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of all Civil Laws. Common People generally have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Patience to conſider, nor Judgment to weigh all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
nor Wiſdom to chooſe that which is beſt; theſe
things of a Publick Nature belong only to our Superiours
and Governours, and if they appoint what is unfit, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
or inconvenient, they only are accountable for it. It
is not the fault of thoſe that joyn with ſuch worſhip, or
yield to ſuch Injunctions (not plainly ſinful) for the ſake
of Peace and Order.</p>
            <p>I know therefore no better Rule for the directing and
quieting Mens Conſciences than this, that as to all ſuch
matters as relate to Publick Order and decent Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods Worſhip, they ſhould without any ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
fearfulneſs comply with the Cuſtoms of the Church
they live in, never troubling themſelves, nor curiouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
what is beſt and fitteſt, as long as there is nothing
enjoyned or done, which (after due enquiry) appears to
us contrary to any Law of God. Thus St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> directs
us in that often quoted place, where he tells us, <hi>He knew
no better courſe for a ſerious prudent Chriſtian to take, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Rites and Cuſtoms, than to follow the Churches exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
where he is: for whatſoever is preſcribed neither againſt
Faith or Manners, is a matter in its ſelf indifferent, and to
be obſerved according to the Cuſtom of thoſe he lives among.</hi>
This was agreeable to the Counſel St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Milan,</hi> gave him when he was ſent by his Mother to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
his Judgment about the Saturday Faſt, <hi>When I am at
Rome,</hi> ſaith the Biſhop, <hi>I fa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t on the Sabbath, but at</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan
<hi>I do not. So thou likewiſe, when thou comeſt to any
Church, obſerve its Cuſtom, if thou wouldeſt neither be an
offence to them, nor have them be ſo to thee.</hi> Which St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi>
ever after looked upon as an <hi>Oracle from Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:54114:21"/>
I do not by this encourage Men to venture blindfold on
Sin, or to neglect any reaſonable care of their Actions; but
if People raiſe all the Difficulties and Objections they can
ſtart, before they proceed to a Reſolution about things that
have no manifeſt Impiety in them, nor are plainly nor by
any eaſie conſequence, contrary to the revealed Will of
God, this cannot but occaſion infinite Perplexity and
Trouble to Mens Minds, and there are but few things they
ſhall be able to do with a ſafe and quiet Conſcience. Should
all thoſe that have ſome little Arguments againſt the Sign
of the Croſs, puzzle themſelves with the Objections uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
urged againſt Infant Baptiſm, and defer baptizing
their Children till they were fully ſatisfied about it, I doubt
not but the baptizing of Infants would ſoon be as much
ſcrupled at as the croſſing them now is. But there is no
apparent Evil in it; it is the Practiſe of the Church we
live in, it is no where forbid in Scripture: this ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is ſufficient warrant for what we do.</p>
            <p>Before we ſeparate from a Church, or refuſe to comply
with its Orders, we ought to be fully ſatisfied and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
of the unlawfulneſs of what is required, that it is
forbid by God; becauſe by leaving the Communion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Church, we paſs Sentence upon and condemn it, which
ought not to be done upon light and doubtful Cauſes: but
there is not the ſame neceſſity that we ſhould be thus ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſatisfied about our Conformity to all things preſcribed
by the Church. We may preſume them to be innocent,
unleſs they plainly appear to us otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Judicious and Learned Biſhop</hi> Sanderſon <hi>thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
it in his fourth Sermon</hi> Ad Clerum, The Law taketh
every Man for a good Man and true, till his Truth aud Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
be legally diſproved: and as our Saviour ſometimes ſaid,
He that is not againſt us is for us: ſo in theſe matters (he
ſpeaks of thoſe Ceremonies that for Orders ſake, and to add
the greater Solemnity to ſacred Actions, are appointed in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54114:21"/>
Church) we are to believe all things to be lawful for us to do,
which cannot be ſhewn by good Evidence either of Scripture
or Reaſon to be unlawful.</p>
            <p>If any one be afraid that this Principle once imbibed
would introduce Popery, make People greedily ſwallow,
and without any Examination ſubmit to every thing their
Superiours pleaſe to impoſe upon them, let him only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
(which we all agree in) that there are many things in
the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Worſhip and Religion manifeſtly evil, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by the revealed Will of God, which renders our
Separation from them neceſſary, and ſo conſequently juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable:
whereas the things objected againſt in our Church
are at worſt only doubtful and ſuſpicious, or rather not ſo
good and expedient as might be deviſed: and this ſurely
makes a wide difference in the caſe.</p>
            <p>But doth not St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>Rom. 14. 19. I know and am
perſwaded by the Lord Jeſus, that there is nothing unclean
of it ſelf, but to him that eſteemeth any thing unclean it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean?</hi>
Doth not he expreſly tell us, <hi>That whatſoever is not
of Faith is Sin?</hi> that is, Whatever we do without a full
Perſuaſion of the lawfulneſs of it, tho it be not ſo in it ſelf,
yet is a Sin in him that doth it againſt his Conſcience. And
doth not the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>He that doubteth is damned if he
eat,</hi> before he is convinced that it may be done? I deſire
here therefore only to be rightly underſtood, and then
theſe things are ſoon reconciled.</p>
            <p>1. When I ſpeak of a Scrupulous Conſcience I ſuppoſe
the Perſon tolerably well perſwaded of the lawfulneſs of
what is to be done, but yet he doth not like or approve
of it, he hath ſome little Reaſons and Exceptions againſt
it, it is not the beſt and fitteſt, all things conſidered. This is
properly a Scruple, and is certainly the caſe of all thoſe,
who do ſometimes (to ſave themſelves from the ſeverity
of the Laws) joyn in our Worſhip, and communicate with
us; which we preſume they would never do did they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54114:22"/>
judge it abſolutely ſinful and forbidden by God. So that
though it ſhould be granted that a man cannot innocently
do that of which his Conſcience doubts whether it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
or not, yet a Man may, and in ſome caſes is bound to
do that which is not unlawful, though upon ſome other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
he ſcruples the doing of it.</p>
            <p>2. If the Queſtion be about things wherein we are left
wholly to our ſelves, and at liberty, having no very weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Reaſon for the doing of them, then it may be the ſafeſt
way to forbear all ſuch things we ſcruple at. Of ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the fore-mentioned Places, of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or not eating ſome Meats; neither of them was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by any law. Eating was no inſtance of Duty, or was it
any ways forbid: where to do or not to do is perfectly at
our own choice; it is beſt for a Man to forbear doing that
of which he hath ſome ſuſpicion, tho he be not ſure
that it is ſinful. As ſuppoſe a man have Scruples in his
Mind about playing at Cards and Dice, or going to ſee
Stage-Plays, or puting out his Money to Uſury, becauſe
there is no great Reaſon or Neceſſity for any of theſe things,
and to be ſure they may be innocently forborn without
any Detriment to our ſelves or others; though we do not
judge them abſolutely ſinful, yet it is ſafeſt for him who
cannot ſatisfie himielf concerning the Goodneſs and Fitneſs
of them, wholly to deny himſelf the uſe of them. But in
theſe two caſes it is moſt for the quiet of our Conſciences,
to act againſt or notwithſtanding our Fears and Scruples,
when either our Superiours, to whom we owe Obedience,
have interpoſed their Commands, or when by it we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
ſome great Evil or Miſchief.</p>
            <p>1. When our Superiours, other Civil or Eccleſiaſtical,
whom by the Will of God we are bound to obey in all
lawful things, have interpoſed their Commands, our Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
will not excuſe or juſtifie our Diſobedience. If indeed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54114:22"/>
we judge what is commanded to be abſolutely unlawful,
tho it be a falſe erroneous Judgment, yet whilſt we are
under ſuch perſuaſion we are by no means to do it upon
any Inducement whatever.</p>
            <p>If I only doubt of the lawfulneſs of any particular Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and it be an inſtance wherein I am at liberty, I am ſtill
bound not to do it. For, <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith is Sin.</hi>
I am certainly innocent when I forbear; I may commit a
Sin, if I do it, Wiſdom would therefore, that the ſafer
part be choſen. But now if I am by the command of my
Superiours obliged to it, my choice is then determined, it
then becomes my Duty, and it can never be ſafe or adviſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to neglect a plain Duty for an uncertain Offence. Thus
moſt and beſt <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> do determine about a doubtful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
particularly the forenamed reverend Biſhop, in the
ſame Sermon, <hi>Whatſoever is commanded us by thoſe whom
God hath ſet over us, either in Church, Commonwealth, or
Family</hi> (quod tamen non ſit certum diſplicere Deo, <hi>ſaith
St.</hi> Bernard) <hi>which is not evidently contrary to the Law and
Will of God, ought to be of us received and obeyed no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
than as if God himſelf had commanded it, becauſe God
himſelf hath commanded us to obey the Higher Powers and to
ſubmit our ſelves to their Ordinances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now this is more plain concerning Fears and Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
only about the conveniency and expediency of things,
theſe ought all to be deſpiſed when they come in Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
with the Duty of Obedience. Would men but think
themſelves in Conſcience bound to pay the ſame Duty and
reſpect to the Judgment and Authority of Magiſtrates and
Governours, whether in Church or State, as they do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
their Servants and Children ſhould to themſelves, they
would ſoon ſee the reaſonableneſs of ſuch ſubmiſſion. For
all Government and Subjection would be very precarious
and arbitrary, if every one that did not approve of a Law
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54114:23"/>
or was not fully ſatisfied about the reaſonableneſs of it was
thereby exempted from all Obligations to obey it. This is
to give the Supreme Authority to the moſt humourſom or
perverſe ſort of Chriſtians: for according to this principle,
no publick Laws and Conſtitutions can be valid and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
unleſs every ſcrupulous, tho a very ignorant Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
conſent to them.</p>
            <p>2. We are not to mind or ſtand upon our Scruples,
when they probably occaſion a great evil, a general miſchief.
They are not fit to be put in the balance with the Peace of
the Church and Unity of Chriſtians. Suppoſe for once
that our publick way of Worſhip is not the beſt that can
be diviſed, that many things might be amended in our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
that we could invent a more agreeable Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than this preſent is (which yet no man in the World
can ever tell, for we cannot know all the inconveniences
of any Alteration, till it comes to be tryed) yet granting
all this, it cannot be thought ſo intolerable an Evil as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Gods Solemn Worſhip, dividing into Sects and
Parties, living in Debate, Contention, and Separation from
one another. If there be ſome Rites and Cuſtoms amongſt
us not wiſely choſen or determined, ſome Ceremonies
againſt which juſt Exceptions may be made, yet to forſake
the Communion of ſuch a true Church of Jeſus Chriſt, and
ſet up a diſtinct Altar in oppoſition to it, to combine and
aſſociate into ſeparate Congregations, is (as it is ſomewhere
expreſſed) <hi>like knocking a man on the head becauſe his Teeth
are rotten, or his Nails too long.</hi> How much more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
is it to the Chriſtian Temper, to be willing to ſacrifice
all ſuch Doubts and Scruples to the Intereſts of publick
Order and divine Charity; for better ſurely it is to ſerve
God in a defective imperfect manner, to bear with many
Diſorders and Faults, than to break the Bond of Peace
and brotherly Communion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:54114:23"/>
For this we have the example of our Bleſſed Lord and
Saviour, who lived and died in Communion with a Church
where there were far greater Corruptions both as to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and Practiſes, than can be pretended to be in
ours at this day; yet though he was the great Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of mankind, he forſook not the Jewiſh Church,
but aſſembled with them in their Publick Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
which anſwer to our Pariſh-Churches, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Temple tho they had made it a Den of Thieves,
obſerved their Feſtivals, tho ſome of them of humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
nay commanded his Diſciples to continue to hear
the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> tho they were a moſt vile and
wretched Generation of Men. Great were the Pollutions
and Miſdemeanours in the Churches of <hi>Rome, Corinth, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia,</hi>
yet no one Member of them is ever commanded to
come out or ſeparate from thoſe Churches to joyn in a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
Congregation or to avoid mixt Communions, or for
better Edification. For men to be drunk at the Sacrament
was certainly a worſe Fault than to kneel at it, or for a
wicked Man to intrude himſelf; yet the Apoſtle doth not
adviſe any to withdraw from that Church, but only eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one to examine himſelf. We ought to do all that we
can do without ſining, ſubmit to an hundred things which
are againſt our Mind or we had rather let alone, for the
ſake of Peace and Unity, ſo deſirable in it ſelf, ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for the Glory of God, the Honour of Religion, for
our common Intereſt and Safety, for the Preſervation of
what I may, without Vanity, call the beſt Church in the
World.</p>
            <p>I cannot ſtand now to tell you, how earneſtly this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of maintaining Unity amongſt Chriſtians is preſſed in the
New Teſtament; how concerned our Bleſſed Maſter was,
that all his Diſciples ſhould agree together and live as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tren;
how ſeverely the Holy Apoſtles chid and rebuked
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54114:24"/>
thoſe that cauſed Diviſions and Strife amongſt Chriſtians,
reckoning Schiſm and Contention amongſt the moſt hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and dangerous Sins. It ſhould make both the Ears
(one would think) of ſome amongſt us to tingle, but to
hear what Senſe the Primitive Chriſtians had of the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſeparating from and breaking the Communion of
Chriſtians, nay, what the old Non-conformiſts here in
<hi>England</hi> have ſaid of it, yet remaining in Print, charging
the People to be as tender of Church-Diviſion as they
were of Drunkenneſs, Whoredom, or any other enormous
Crime. And did Men know and conſider the evil of Schiſm,
they would not be ſo ready upon every ſlight occaſion to
ſplit upon that Rock.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore divert our Fears and Scruples upon
greater Sins. It is far more certain that cauſleſs Separation
from the Communion of Chriſtians is ſinful, than that kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Sacrament, or praying by a Book is ſuch. Why
then have Men ſuch invincible Scruples about one, and
none at all about the other? They run headlong into the
Separate Aſſemblies, which ſurely are more like to Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Conventicles than any thing in our Church is to
Idolatry. Let Men be as ſcrupulous and fearful of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt the Chriſtian Laws of Subjection, Peaceableneſs,
and Charity, as they are of worſhipping God after an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
manner, and this alone will contribute much to the
making up thoſe Breaches which threaten ſudden Ruine to
our Church and Nation. I only add here, that in all that
I have now ſaid I am not conſcious to my ſelf, that I have
uſed any Argument or affirmed any thing, but what many
of thoſe very Miniſters, who now diſſent from us, did
teach, and maintain, and print too, againſt the <hi>Independents</hi>
and other Sectaries that divided from them when they
preached in the Pariſh-Churches. And if this was good
Doctrine againſt thoſe who ſeparated upon the account of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54114:24"/>
Corruptions, for purer Ordinances in thoſe days, I ſee
not why it is not as good againſt themſelves, when upon
the very ſame Pretences and no other they divide from
us now.</p>
            <q>The Lord grant that we may all come at laſt to be of
one Mind, to live in Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, and then
the God of Love and Peace ſhall be with us.</q>

Take heed of ſeparating from the Publick Aſſemblies
of the Saints. I have found by experience, that all our
Church-calamities have ſprung from this root. He that
