         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

had in remembrance
of <hi>all men,</hi> so this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is more required

<hi>their</hi> charge is greater then the charge of
<pb facs="tcp:7927:4"/>
               <hi>other</hi> men: for they must answer both
for the government of <hi>themselues,</hi> and of
<hi>others</hi> vnder them. Wherefore having
observed the Workes of God in delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> from the cruell
plots of the Adversaries, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to this time:
I found my selfe most obliged to present
this to your <hi>Highness;</hi> both because my
service, next to his <hi>Maiestie</hi> is most due to
your <hi>Highness;</hi> and because the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the great Workes of God is a
<hi>Glasse</hi> fit for a <hi>Prince</hi> to <hi>looke</hi> on. For your
<hi>Highness</hi> may be assured that the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
will not change their disposition,
vnlesse either we were reduced to their
<hi>blindness,</hi> or they drawne to imbrace the
<hi>truth</hi> with vs. I haue made this <hi>Collection</hi>
that by examples of <hi>things past,</hi> We may
better iudge of <hi>things to come.</hi> My labour
herein is nothing. For I <hi>make</hi> not the
Story, but <hi>take</hi> it of others. And when I
light vpon the best Narration, as that of
the <hi>Gun-powder treason,</hi> I haue set it downe
as I find it without alteration. Because as
that cannot be mended, so to set a worse
<pb facs="tcp:7927:4"/>
Narration in the place thereof, were no
lesse then to abuse the Reader. I leaue
the honor entire to them that haue made
the Story, I take no part thereof to mee.
Onely my care hath beene to <hi>obserue</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those great deliverances <hi>the Workes of
God,</hi> that God may be <hi>glorified,</hi> and the
cause <hi>iustified</hi> which God hath maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from Heaven. SIR, I suppose it is
hard to finde a Narration containing
more <hi>miraculous</hi> Protection of Gods
<hi>Church,</hi> since that time wherein God
shewed his <hi>Miracles</hi> in protecting the
people of <hi>Israel.</hi> Which consideration
may serue to <hi>fasten</hi> your <hi>Highness</hi> to the
loue and <hi>service</hi> of that great God, that
doth so <hi>strongly</hi> maintain his <hi>servants.</hi> That
as hitherto you haue had a gracious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of his grace and goodnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you, so your noble heart may
grow every day more and more in the
loue and obedience of the truth. We are
all charged by Gods Word to <hi>pray for
Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes.</hi> That charge which
God hath layd vpon vs all, no man can
put off: But when your <hi>Highness</hi> hath
<pb facs="tcp:7927:5"/>
effectually made knowne your singular
care and loue to the common good, to
the rejoycing of all faithfull men; this
must needs draw the hearts of all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
men nearer to your <hi>Highness.</hi> And
this is a part of your happiness; for the
feare of God and loue of Subiects is able
to make <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> strong against
all their enemies <hi>God giue his iudgements to
the King, and his righteousness to the Kings sonne,</hi>
and therewith, all blessings; <hi>grace</hi> and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

ELIZABETH, at her first entrance; for therein
will appeare a wonderfull Worke of God, and my
intention is to obserue the great Workes of God,
that God may be glorified.</p>
            <p>When this famous Queene first entred,<note place="margin">She entred <hi>Anno.</hi> 1558.</note> shee
found the State much afflicted, and weakned.
All the great States about her, were enemies.
Friends none. King <hi>Philip,</hi> who offred his loue
and kindnesse to her, and would haue married
her, offering to obteine the Popes dispensation
for him to marry two Sisters; as the like dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
was obteined by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his great
Grand-father, for h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s daughter <hi>Katharine</hi> to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
two Brothers, he offering this kindnesse, and
being refused and reiected, grew first into dislike
and discontent, afterwardes into hatred, and at
last brake out into open Warres. The French
King <hi>Henry</hi> the 2. with whom she sought peace,
fell off also into open Warres. His sonne <hi>Francis</hi>
having married <hi>Mary,</hi> Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was
moved by the <hi>Guysians</hi> to cause the Armes of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
to be ioyned to the Armes of <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp; to
professe the Queene of <hi>Scots</hi> the heire of <hi>England,</hi>
and because <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was accounted by them an
Heretike, therefore they sought to put her by, to
set the Queene of <hi>Scots</hi> in her place, so should the
French King haue <hi>England</hi> also. For the effecting
of this, they sent their Armies into <hi>Scotland,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing

               </gap>om thence to haue subdued <hi>England.</hi>
In so much that <hi>Sebastianus Martignius,</hi> a young
Noble man of the family of <hi>Luxenburg,</hi> who was
sent into <hi>Scotland</hi> with a thousand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oote, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7927:9"/>
some Companies of horse, could hardly be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
from entring <hi>England</hi> presently. So that
<hi>Spaine, France,</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> were enemies. The
State was then much troubled and oppressed
with great debt, contracted partly by <hi>Henry</hi> 8.
partly by <hi>Edward</hi> 6. in his minoritie. The trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
was exhausted; <hi>Calis</hi> was lost. Nothing see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be left to her, but a weake, and poore
State, destitute of meanes and friends. If shee
would haue admitted the Popish Religion, then
might all these difficulties haue beene removed
But establishing the Gospell, shee vnderstood well
that shee drew all these troubles vpon her owne
head. Yet she gaue the glory to God, and in hope
of Gods holy protection, she established Gods
holy truth. And verily she did not serue God in
vaine. For it is a thing to be wondred at, that
the Land being then without strength, without
Forces, without Souldiers, yea, without Armour;
all things necessary should be so suddenly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
She had provided Armour at <hi>Antwerpe,</hi>
but King <hi>Philip</hi> caused that to be stayed. Yet was
she not discouraged, but layd out much money
vpon Armour, though she found the Treasury
but poore. She procured Armour and weapons
out of <hi>Germany.</hi> She caused many great Gunnes
to be cast, of Brasse and Iron. And Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and favour appeared in her protectio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.
For new Mines of Brasse were found at <hi>Keswike,</hi>
that had long beene neglected. From Whence
there was not onely sufficient matter to supply
her wants, but abundance thereof to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7927:10"/>
to other Countries. The stone called <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis
Calaminaris,</hi> whose vse is needfull for working
in Brasse, was also at the same time first found in
<hi>England.</hi> There was provision made at home also
for the making of Gunne-powder. Which was
done first here by her Commandement. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was bought and imported. <hi>Berwick</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her time, was weake, and had but fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Souldiers: She fortified the Towne, made
the new inner Wall, and increased the number
of Souldiers, and their stipends, that provision
might be made for the training vp of experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Souldiers and martiall men. She provided a
Navie, the best furnished that euer <hi>England</hi> sawe.
Neither needed she to doe as her Father and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours
were wont to doe, when they wanted
Shippes, to send for Shippes and hire them from
<hi>Hamburg, Lubeck, Dantisk, Genua,</hi> and <hi>Veni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e;</hi> for
she had them ready at home to serue her. Yea all
the good Townes vpon the Sea-coast, beholding
this incredible alacritie, and forwardnes in their
Prince, strived also to imitate the same, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with great chearfulnesse and readinesse built
Shippes for Warre. So that in a short time, the
Queenes Shippes and those of the Subiects ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together, rose to such a number, that they
were able to imploy twentie thousand men in
Sea-fight at once. The Noble-men, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and Yeomen, did all striue to answer so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a resolution of their Prince. And therefore
great store of Armour and Weapons were every
where provided. And braue spirits were bred
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7927:10"/>
and inabled to service, whereby they became an
helpe and ornament to their Countrey. So that
Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was quickly growne so strong,
that all her adversaries were not able to hurt her.
And was not this a great worke of God? That so
weake a Woman should be able to defend her
selfe against so many, so potent enemies? Yea,
and not onely to match them, but to master
them? This was Gods doing. Behold what it is
to trust in <hi>God,</hi> and not in an arme of <hi>Flesh.</hi> God
will haue his great Workes to be had in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
that all men, especially Princes may be
taught to know that their safetie is not in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
policie, but in God which never forsaketh
them that trust in him. Here then we haue a
Worke, for which we are bound to glorifie God.
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> a Prince, at the beginning weake, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of friends, vnfurnished of treasure, vnpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
of all things, had in no other accompt of
her great neighbours round about her, but as one
left as a prey to the strongest that would inuade
her and her kingdome: yet preparing her heart
to God, giuing God the glory, establishing his
truth in her Land, trusting in him: She was in a
few yeares made strong against her enemies; they
feared her more then she feared them. This is an
example can hardly be paralleled. It was a worke
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> God in defence of his Church here, and we
yeeld all glory and prayse vnto God for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
shewed herein. From this example, Princes
may take a worthy instruction to rest vpon God,
and to seeke his glory, and know assuredly, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7927:11"/>
when they are at the weakest state, if they giue
their hearts to God, and their service to his true
Religion, God will raise them to greatnes, who
hath promised to <hi>honor them that honor him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 30.</note> and
threatned, that <hi>they that dishonor him, shall be despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi>
Before I leaue this example of Gods protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of this noble Queene in her first entrance: Let
this be remembred, that as all the great Princes
adioyning, with the Pope and all, were her great
enemies, so there were no friends able to helpe
her: for they that were friends, and would haue
helped if they could, stood all need of her help.
The <hi>Scots</hi> were sore troubled with the <hi>French</hi>
Armies procured by the <hi>Guysians,</hi> but shee hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
them, and protected the King in his mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
and freed that State from the tyranny of
the <hi>French</hi> governement. The <hi>Low-Countries,</hi>
were tyrannised by the Duke <hi>D' Alva</hi> who chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
their governement, and inhibited their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
in councell. For to speake somewhat of
the ancient governement of that people, to stop
the common imputations cast vpon them by
such as are not well affected to them: Their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement
was by a generall assembly of the
States: Their governours were such as were
borne within the 17. Provinces, no strangers.
These were anciently the Clergie, the Nobility,
and the Deputies of the Provinces, and of good
Townes, meeting together in their generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies.
These so meeting made lawes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
whereby that State was governed. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
were sent to the generall Assemblies, by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7927:11"/>
the Suffrages of the people, and vpon cause they
were recalled by the people, and other sent in
their roomes. This manner of governement,
some of the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and some others
disliked, as giving too much power to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and to little to their Dukes: and therefore
laboured to change it, but could not. <hi>Charles the
fift</hi> Emperour would gladly haue changed their
governement, but when he saw that it could not
be done without the commotion of the whole
State, he left it vndone. <hi>Philip 2. Anno</hi> 1549.
<hi>Iuly</hi> 8. tooke his oath, which he made and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
againe <hi>Anno</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>555. to keepe, maintaine,
and preserue these Countries in their ancient
rights, priviledges, and customes, without brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them or suffering them to be broken, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sort or manner. But when the Duke <hi>D' Alva</hi>
was governour there vnder the King, he practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the contrary, and professed that the King
was not to governe them, as his ancient inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
but as vpon a new conquest, making what
lawes he would, and setting what governement
best pleased him. Whereupon his whole drift
and practise was for a newe conquest of all the
Provinces and Townes. The pretence of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was sought: but it was resolved by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to change the whole governement,
and to erect a new. This appeared aswell by the
Dukes open profession, as by those designes
which he practised vpon the persons of some of
the Nobility, and vpon the good Townes. For

did this, could not pretend religion, because
these Earles were of the Popish religion. they
could not pretend any disloyalty against them,
for their firme loyalty and their great services to
the King, made them so confident; onely it was
thought that these Noble men would neuer
yeeld to the change of the government of that
State, therefore they were cut off. The like ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in the strange surprises and cruelty practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
against many Townes, which were of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
religion. For divers townes that were firme
to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in the point of religion, and in
obedience to the King, when armies were sent
to them, intertaining the armies in all obedience,
opening their gates, shewing all loue and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to the <hi>Spanish</hi> armies: were of a suddaine
surprised, and brought to vtter ruine. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
killing and massackring all, taking their
goods, abusing their wiues and daughters, as the
manner of such barbarous men is in a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,

               </gap>rcising more cruelties against their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
friends, then they could doe to their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Such barbarous cruelties were practised
against the Townes of <hi>Machlin, Maestrich, Zut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen,
Naerden, Antwerp,</hi> and others, who were
their friends, agreeing in the same religion with
them, holding as then, their obedience firme to
the King: yet were they spoyled, killed, ransac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and overthrowne like enemies. Which
strange cruelty declared that it was not religion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7927:12"/>
that moved this cruelty, but that which the
Duke <hi>D'Alva</hi> did openly professe, that the King
must hold all the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> by a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
that so he might change the governement,
and impose what lawes he would.</p>
            <p>It may seeme a strange vse of the Popes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
which King <hi>Philip</hi> made, when from the
Pope he got a dispensation of that oath, which
he had taken at his entrance into the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</hi>
This is an vse of a Pope fit indeede for
them that would doe whatsoever they list with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
conscience, or the feare of Gods lawes or
mans. If such an vse may be made of the Popes
power, then Popish Princes must needes in the
sight of the world, seeme to haue a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
over others. But if they may so dispense at
their pleasure with oathes and promises, then
may all those of their religion see plainely that
there are neither humane nor divine bands or
securitie that can binde Papists: for when they
please, the Pope will free them from all bands
of conscience, from the lawes of God, of man,
of nature, of nations. But God will not be thus
served. And therefore by Gods iust iudgements
they that rely vpon such vngodly practises, loose
more in the ende, then they gaine by such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
dealings. This was the cause of their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
in the <hi>Low Countries.</hi> That state being then
so tro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> yet did shee yeelde helpe to them.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and the Protestants
in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> were not able to helpe her, nor to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7927:13"/>
helpe themselues without her meanes. This
must needes be acknowledged an extraordinary
blessing of God, to make her able to withstand
the greatest enemies, and to helpe all that were
distressed for Religion.</p>
            <p>This famous Queene though troubled by
forraine states in the beginning of her Raigne,
yet had great peace and quietnes at home. This
was the fruit of true religion: her Subiects lived
in peace, and tranquilitie; no motions then at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted.
Only in the fourth yeare of her Raign,
<hi>Arthur Poole,</hi> and his brethren comming of the
race of <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> who was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Antony Fortiskue,</hi>
who married their sister, with some other of that
conspiracie, were brought to their tryall, for
that they had conspired to flie to the <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>France,</hi> and thence to come with an Armie
into <hi>Wales,</hi> and there to declare the <hi>Scottish</hi>
Queene, to be Queene of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Arthur
Poole</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence.</hi> All which they freely
confessed at their tryall: yet protesting that it
was not their purpose to execute this designe,
as long as Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> lived: who as they
supposed should dye within a yeare; for so some
cosening <hi>Astrologians</hi> had told them. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they were condemned, yet their liues were
spared in respect of their blood. Wherein wee
may acknowledge the goodnes of God in disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
such a plot, before it tooke strength, and
the noble nature of the Queene, that dealt so
nobly with her owne blood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:7927:13"/>Thus the Land within rested in great quietnes,
for some yeares. The Church was established,
and increased, learning flourished, godlines and
true pietie prevailed, Popish ignorance was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
into corners. The <hi>Papists</hi> that then were,
were content to keepe themselues quiet. Either
they kept their Religion private to themselues,
or els they came to our Churches, as most of
them did. But the enemy of all goodnesse envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this peaceable state of <hi>England,</hi> stirred vp the
Pope to giue occasion to new troubles, and to
wrap the Kingdome into dangers. Whereby as
the Church hath beene more troubled, then it
was before, so the <hi>Papists</hi> haue got nothing by
the bargain, but lost much, by stirring vp the
peaceable inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Prince against them,
and by provoking the State to make severe lawes

who seemed to be a moderate man. For he was
moved by the Count of <hi>Feria,</hi> who served the
King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to excommunicate Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
but he thought it not good to proceed to
such extremities. For seeing the Popes authority
is a thing consisting rather in the conceits of
some men, then in any truth and substance: If it
should once appeare that this thunderbolt of ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>communicate,

               </gap>er, then might this great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
fall into contempt, and so be made ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
Whether for this cause or what other, he
would not be perswaded to vse this extremitie
against the Queene,<note place="margin">An. Do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 1560.</note> but sent Letters, shewing
some loue and kindnesse, by an Abbot <hi>Parpalia,</hi>
by whom also he sent certaine secret Mandates.
Which what they were was not openly knowne.
But some acquainted well with State affayres
then, reported that the Pope offred to recall and
disanull the sentence as vniust which was given
against her Mothers marriage, and to confirme
the <hi>English Liturgie</hi> by his authoritie, granting
also the vse of the Sacrament vnder both kindes,
so that she would ioyne her selfe to the <hi>Romane</hi>
Church, &amp; acknowledge the Popes supremacy.
And for the effecting hereof, a great sum of gold
was promised to some that should be vsed as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
for this purpose. But Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>
remaining SEMPER EADEM, ever like her

the Pope.</p>
            <p>But the next Pope, <hi>Pius</hi> V. that succeeded,
tooke another course, whether a better or worse,
let the event declare. For in the yeare 1569. he

And hath openly declared to all the world, that
the Popes curse is a thing proceeding from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

in peeces without any other trouble, saving that
which fell vpon the plotters themselues, &amp; their
instruments. The King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who watched
all opportunities to doe mischiefe, wrote one

raise a power within <hi>England,</hi> and wrote another
to the Earle of <hi>Ormond,</hi> to raise a tumult in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
But both the Duke and the Earle shewed
the Letters to the Queene, declaring thereby a
purpose to be loyall. The Duke suffred himselfe
to be wrought vpon too much by pernicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments.

For they supposing by this, the plot to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed,
brake out into open rebellion, before the

executed, not onely among the <hi>Catholikes,</hi>
but also among some <hi>Protestants,</hi> who conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
together herein; some out of private hatred
against them that aspired to the Kingdome,
others out of a desire of a change. Whilst these
things were secretly carried, a contention rose
betweene the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> vpon the
occasion of a sum of money going to the Duke
<hi>Dalva,</hi> but intercepted by <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This occasion the Pope apprehended to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade

had withdrawne the forces of <hi>England,</hi>
that they could do lesse helpe to the <hi>Protestants</hi>
of <hi>France,</hi> neither did the noble conspiratours

their cunning haue hindered the Queene of

of <hi>France.</hi> In this respect the <hi>French</hi> King
promised them ayd for the deliverance of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7927:16"/>
                  <hi>Scots</hi> Queene, but failed of performance of any
thing. In the meane time, <hi>Ridolphus</hi> effected
thus much, that the conspiratours should draw
the Duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> into their societie, and
make him chiefe therein, to whom they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
marriage with the <hi>Scots</hi> Queene, whereto
she consented. The Pope to set these things for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
by his Bull published, deposed <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
from her Kingdome, and absolued her subiects
from all oath and alleagance, sending the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Coppies to <hi>Ridolphus,</hi> which might be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
ouer <hi>England.</hi> Whereupon the Earles of
<hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmerland,</hi> tooke Armes
against their Prince, who presently, money and
meanes failing, withdrew themselues into
<hi>Scotland.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> with others,
were committed to prison. Among them was
<hi>Ridolphus,</hi> whom the Pope had appointed to
helpe the conspiratours with an hundreth and
fiftie thousand Crownes, which thing he could
not doe being clapt vp in prison. But when the
Queene could not pierce into the secrets of the
conspiracy, he was sent out of prison with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and then he distributed those Crownes
to the conspirators. Who sent him to the Pope
to informe him that all things were prepared in
a readines, and ordered against <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> and
to intreat the <hi>Spanish</hi> King, to ioyne his Forces
from the <hi>Netherlands</hi> as soone as may be: the
Pope commended the enterprise, albeit, the
Duke <hi>Dalva</hi> did not like it, as being full of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
when as <hi>Ridolphus</hi> in his iourney told
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7927:17"/>
him the matter. The Pope sent <hi>Ridolfe</hi> to the
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> vnder another pretence, and to the
King of <hi>Portugall</hi> with ins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ructions; and at the
same time writing to the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
him ayde. He did much vrge the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi>
to helpe the conspiratours, and to the end
he might the more vehemently stirre him vp,
he promised if need were himselfe would goe
for to helpe them, and would ingage all the
goods of the Sea Apostolike, Chalices, Crosses,
and holy Vestments. Declaring that there was
no difficultie in it, if he would send <hi>Chapinus
Vitellius</hi> with an Army into <hi>England</hi> from the
<hi>Low-Countries.</hi> Which thing the King of <hi>Spaine</hi>
commanded to be done with great alacritie.
And the Pope provided money in the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</hi>
These things were not pleasing to the
Duke <hi>Dalva,</hi> both because he enuied <hi>Vitellius</hi>
this glory, wherein he rather wished his owne
sonne to be imployed, and because he feared
some hostile invasion out of <hi>France,</hi> and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it to be considered, whether <hi>England</hi> being
overcome would fall to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> whether
the <hi>French</hi> would not resist that proiect, and
whether the Pope were able to bring helpe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to effect so great a matter. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the <hi>Spanish</hi> King expressely commanded
him to set vpon <hi>England. Ridolf</hi> was sent backe
with money to the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> But see how
God would haue it: All the matter was opened
to <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by a stranger without the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
The Duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> was apprehended
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7927:17"/>
and put to death. Which thing the Pope tooke
heavily, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> condoled, who before the
Cardinall of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the Popes Nephew,
sayd, that never any conspiracy was more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly
begun, nor concealed with more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
and consent of minds, which in all that
time was not opened by any of the conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours:
that an Army might easily be sent out of
the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> in the space of 24. houres,
which might suddenly haue taken the Queene
and the Citie of <hi>London</hi> vnprovided, restored
Religion, and set the <hi>Scots</hi> Queene in the
Throne. Especially when as <hi>Stukley</hi> an English

            <p> Thus farre <hi>Catena</hi> writeth of
these things, opening some things that before
were not knowne to the English. The Booke
was Printed at <hi>Rome An: Dom:</hi> 1588. by the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V.</p>
            <p>This is the Narration of a <hi>Papist,</hi> published at
<hi>Rome,</hi> by the authoritie of the Pope. It may
seeme strange to men that haue any feeling of the
feare of God, that a Pope should so boldly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
his owne shame to all the world. The Pope
doth practise treason against States, sets his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
to raise rebellions, stirreth vp Princes
against Princes, one Kingdome against another,
and when he doth this, he will not vnderstand
that he is, in this doing, the instrument and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7927:18"/>
of the Devill, to disorder the world. If any
would excuse this, as being done against an
Heretike: that excuse will not serue here; for I
speake not of excommunicating supposed Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes,
but of raising rebellions against Princes, to
set the subiects to murther the Prince, or to stirre
vp one Prince to murther another, these things
be wicked and vngracious practises, but the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
are growne to such an o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>duration in these
sinnes, that they iudge these no sinnes, to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or secretly to poyson, or by any horrible
mischiefe to compasse their owne endes. The
things that are by the Lawes of God, of Nature,
of Nations, wicked and abominable, against the
ordinances which God hath set in the world,
must forsooth change their nature, if the Pope
command them, nay, if any of their superiours
command such things, their doctrine of <hi>blind o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi>
sets them vpon any mischiefe, and so
they doe not onely <hi>teach for doctrines mens tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
but <hi>make doctrines for mens destructions.</hi>
If the Popes presume that they haue such a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
that the things which are horrible sinnes
in other men are no sinnes in them: this were in
effect as much as for the Pope to proclaime him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
the <hi>Man of sinne,</hi> that runneth into all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
courses <hi>with greedinesse,</hi> with an open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the same. For what can any man of sin
doe more, then to <hi>command</hi> sinne, to <hi>warrant</hi> sin,
to <hi>commit</hi> sin, to <hi>glory in</hi> sin; If all this be done by
the <hi>Pope,</hi> who can iustly deny him this title of the
<hi>Man of sinne?</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:7927:18"/>But blessed be the name of God, that alwayes
delivered his Church here from such wicked
practises, and hath brought the mischiefe that
these wicked men haue deuised, vpon their owne

himselfe in the house of <hi>Hector of Harlaw</hi> an
<hi>Armstrang,</hi> having confidence in him that he
would be true to him, who notwithstanding for
money betrayed him to the Regent of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
It was observed, that <hi>Hector</hi> being before a rich
man, fell poore of a sudden, and so hated gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
that he never durst goe abroad, in so much,
that the Proverb <hi>to take Hectors cloake,</hi> is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to this day among them, when they would
expresse a man that betrayeth his friend who
trusted him: The Earle was afterward delivered
into <hi>England,</hi> and condemned of high treason
and beheaded. <hi>Westmerland</hi> found meanes to
hide him a while with <hi>Fernihurst</hi> and <hi>Bucklough,</hi>
and escaped into the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> where being
susteined by a poore pension of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
he liued a poore life all his time.</p>
            <p>This is the fruit of <hi>Popery.</hi> It bringeth Noble
houses to destruction. It pittied their hearts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom the rebellion was raised, to see such
Noble persons brought to such a destruction.
But the <hi>Pope</hi> is without pitty and mercy, the
<hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Iesuites</hi> that bring such noble men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such snares, haue no pitty nor mercy, therefore
it behooveth all noble persons to be wise, and to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7927:20"/>
avoyd pestiferous waies, that is, to shut their eares
against <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Iesuites.</hi> These be pernicious
instruments, that secretly convey themselues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
great mens favour, to bring them to ruine,
they tell them of the Religion of their Fathers,
but true Religion bringeth a blessing, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
that bringeth alwayes a curse is to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.
And to say truth the Religion of <hi>Rome</hi>
as now, is not the Religion of our Fathers. For
Religion was changed in the <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ent Councell,</hi> and
therefore they cannot say they haue now that
Religion which their Fathers had. And that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
was changed in the <hi>Trent Synod,</hi> is by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
men sufficiently proued; and we are readie
to maintaine it: for where the <hi>rule of faith</hi> is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
there must needs follow a change of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and a change of the <hi>Church.</hi> But in the <hi>Trent
Councell</hi> the rule of faith is changed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men may obserue a great difference between
these men that are now called <hi>Papists,</hi> and their
forefathers. God blessed their Fathers, because
they serued God in sinceritie, according to that
measure of knowledge which was reuealed to
them; for he that serueth God truely, according
to that measure of knowledge which he hath,
and holdeth the rule of faith: is without doubt
accepted of God, and God doth blesse such.
But after that God hath reuealed a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of knowledge, by the spreading of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of his Gospell, they who then forsake the
truth offred, are followed with great curses. And
therefore we may plainly obserue the curses of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7927:20"/>
God vpon them that forsake God and his truth;
Where the <hi>Pope</hi> curseth, we see that God doth
blesse, and no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>This rebellion was scarce extinguished, when
another little flame rose from this greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion.
<hi>Leonard Dacres</hi> the second sonne of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> of <hi>Gillestand</hi> (whose eldest bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> their Father in law had ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

<hi>Leonard Dacres,</hi> that having no other way to

and discontented men,<note place="margin">An. Do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 1569.</note> to revenge all vpon
himselfe, and ioyning himselfe to the rebells,
striued but in vaine, to deliver the <hi>Scots Queene.</hi>
When they were in armes then was <hi>Leonard Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres</hi>
at Court, and offred the Queene all his helpe
against them, and for that service was sent home.
But (as it came to light afterward) in his iourney

and incouraging them, vndertooke to

that he perswaded his brethren to submit
themselues. They were put in prison, but that
they might not be brought to iudgement, the
Earles daily intercession prevailed with the
Queene. It grieued the Earle exceedingly to see
such a blot vpon so noble a family; And the
Queene was willing to preserue the honor of
the house: as for the reliques of that rebellion,
they were in short time dissipared by the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the <hi>Lord Deputy,</hi> and the industry of Sir
<hi>Humphrey Gilbert.</hi>
            </p>

God, for breaking the purposes of our adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
before they grew great. This is his goodnes
toward his Church; and his iudgement vpon the

            <p>The King of <hi>Spaine</hi> never rested to stirre vp
troubles to Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> pretending the
deliverance of the <hi>Scots Queene,</hi> but it appeareth
that his intention was for himselfe, as the Duke
<hi>Dalva</hi> vnderstood it. This is evident by that
which we haue mentioned out of <hi>Catena.</hi> For
Duke <hi>Dalva</hi> was in some feare that if Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>
were overthrowne, yet the Kingdome of
<hi>England</hi> might not fall to the <hi>Spanyard,</hi> but to the
<hi>French.</hi> So that it was in their intention certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be cast vpon the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Spanyard,</hi> and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7927:22"/>
here was no reckoning made of the Queene of
<hi>Scots.</hi> So that howsoever the pretence was for
her deliverance, yet there was another thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
For seeing Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
and deposed, if she could once be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne,
then they made no other reckoning
but that <hi>England</hi> would fall to the strongest. Now
the <hi>Spanyard</hi> thinking himselfe the stronger,
sought this prerogatiue for himselfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he ceased not to raise troubles to the <hi>Queene,</hi>
and the rather, because he held it a thing impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for him to recover the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> vnlesse
he had <hi>England.</hi> But because he found it a matter
of great difficultie to set vpon <hi>England,</hi> his first
enterprise was to set vpon <hi>Ireland.</hi> But when that
succeeded not, at last with all Forces that might
be raised, with many yeares preparations he set

into a servile subiection, that it rather armed
them with resolution to defend their liberties,
their lawes, their religion, and their liues. Which

a former Rebellion, withdrew himselfe into

a little money. And to <hi>Sanders</hi> authoritie Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatine

            <p>The <hi>Lord Deputy</hi> vnderstanding by certaine

<hi>Henry Dauil,</hi> an English Gentleman, a man of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and who had good acquaintance with the
<hi>Desmonds,</hi> to the Earle of <hi>Desmond,</hi> and to his

that they re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And as <hi>Dauil</hi> returned, <hi>Iohn Desmond</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
him; and overtaketh him at <hi>Trally</hi> in an

die.</hi> And presently thrust him and <hi>Carter</hi> which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7927:29"/>
lay with him through with many woundes, and
killed them both. <hi>Dauilus</hi> his foot-boy defended
his Master, with his naked body, receiving many
wounds to saue his Master if he could. Then he
killed all <hi>Dauils</hi> servants, which lay scattered in
diverse places. And returning to the Spanyards
all imbrued in bloud, he gloried of the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which he had made. <hi>Let this,</hi> said he, <hi>be to you
a pledge of my faith to you and to the cause.</hi> Doctor
<hi>Sanders</hi> commended this action, as a sweet sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
before God. <hi>Iames fitz Morice</hi> blamed the
manner of the slaughter, he would haue had it
rather in the way, then in their bed. The <hi>Earle,</hi>
when he heard of it, vtterly detested it.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Spanyards</hi> saw but a few <hi>Irish</hi> ioyne
themselues with them, and they poore and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed,
farre otherwise then <hi>fitz Morice</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
they began to distrust, to cry out they
were vndone, to bewaile their fortunes, seeing
all wayes was shut vp so, that they saw no meanes
to escape by Sea or Land. <hi>Fitz Morice</hi> exhorts
them to expect with patience a while; he told
them great forces were comming to helpe them.
And himselfe tooke a iourney to the holy crosse
of <hi>Tippararia,</hi> pretending to performe a Vow

made Hue and Cry, and raised the

neighbourhood to recover the horses. Amongst
these that went to recover the horses, were the
sonnes of <hi>William á Burg,</hi> forward young men,
who pursued them so sharply, that they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
them. <hi>Fitz Morice</hi> seeing <hi>Theobald á Burg,</hi>
and his brethren, who had indeed in a former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
taken part with <hi>fitz Morice: Cosins,</hi> quoth
he, <hi>let vs not striue for two or three paltry lades. I
doubt not, but if you knew the cause why I am retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

Theobald</hi> answered, <hi>It repenteth me, my Father, and
all our friends of the last rebellion. But now we haue
sworne our fealtie to our most gracious Princesse, who
hath granted to vs our liues, and we will keepe our

or I will make thee restore them.</hi> And withall, he
ran vpon him with his Speare. They sought a

            <p>Sir <hi>William Drury</hi> then Lord <hi>Deputy,</hi> came neare

for his healths sake; and appointed <hi>Nicholas

sent to the Earle of <hi>Desmond,</hi> and often ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
him of his dutie and promise: and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it not good to linger in such a businesse, he
brought his forces into <hi>Conil,</hi> a woody Country,
against the rebells. There was <hi>Iohn Desmond,</hi>
who in battell array, and with the Popes conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated

<hi>Malbey.</hi> It was sharply fought on both sides. But
the vertue of the English prevailed; <hi>Iohn Desmond</hi>
fled first away and left his men to the slaughter.
Among them was found <hi>Alan</hi> the Irish Priest,
who exhorting them to the battell, had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them the Victory. <hi>Malbey</hi> by a messenger sent

some from the <hi>Catholike</hi> King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to whom
the <hi>Pope</hi> had given <hi>Ireland;</hi> for as much as <hi>Queene

            <p>
               <hi>San-Iosephus</hi> who was governour within the
Fort, a weake man, and terrified with the daily
shot, began quickly to thinke of yeelding. And
when as <hi>Hercules Pisanus,</hi> and other Captaines,
disswaded him earnestly from that, as a thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of military men, vrging that all should
prepare for a defence, least by their negligence
they might withdraw the courage of the <hi>Irish,</hi>
which were comming to helpe them. But he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a man of singular cowardise, assayed the
mindes of the souldiers, and wrought so, that the
souldiers sedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ously offred force to the other
Captaines, that at last they consented to yeeld.
Wherevpon the fift day, when they saw no hope
of helpe, neither from <hi>Spaine,</hi> nor <hi>Desmond,</hi> they
put out a white flagge and demaunded parley.
Which thing was denied them because they had
ioyned themselues with the rebells, with whom
it was not lawfull to haue any parley. Then they
demanded that with bag &amp; baggage they might
depart, but neither was this granted. Then they
intreat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d that this favour might be granted at
least to the governour and some few besides, but
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7927:33"/>
that though they much besought it, could not
be granted. But the <hi>Lord Deputy,</hi> inveighing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Pope,</hi> commanded that without any
condition they should simply yeeld themselues.
And when they could obtaine no more, they put
out their white flagge againe, and cryed <hi>miseri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia,
misericordia.</hi> And so submitted themselues
simply to the Lord Deputy his mercy. Who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
fell into consultatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what were best to do.
The adversaries were in number as many as the
<hi>English,</hi> and danger was feared of the Irish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells,
who were moe then 1500<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at hand. The
<hi>English</hi> wanted vittails and apparell, so that they
were ready to make a tumult, v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lesse they might
be relieued by the spoiles of the enemies out of
the fort, and shippes were wanting to carry away
the enemies. At last they came to this conclusion,
(the <hi>Lord Deputy</hi> being much vnwilling &amp; wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping)
that the Captaines should be preserued, the
rest should all be slaine promiscuously in terror of
others that might attempt so hereafter. The I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
should be hanged, which was presently exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.
The <hi>Queene</hi> was not pleased at the maner
of this execution, and wished it had beene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
hating crueltie, though necessary, against
such as haue once yeelded, and was hardly after
drawne to admit any excuse of the slaughter
committed. This was done <hi>An:</hi> 1580. Some
three yeares after the Earle of <hi>Desmond,</hi> of a noble
house, but of a barbarous nature, who barbarous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had sworne that <hi>He would rather forsake God,
then forsake his men,</hi> wandring from place to place,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7927:33"/>
was at last found of a commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> souldier in a poore
cottage. The <hi>Earle</hi> was in a poore estate, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne,
till the souldier had almost struck off his
arme. Then he descryed himselfe, and was killed.
<hi>Nicholas Sanders</hi> that had drawne the <hi>Earle</hi> into
this rebellion, was at the same time spent with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
and forsaken of all succour: and being
impatiently grieued at the evill successe of this
rebellion, proceeding so much against his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
seeing neither the <hi>Popes</hi> blessing, nor the
consecrated Banner, nor the authoritie by the
<hi>Pope</hi> committed to him, could do him any helpe,
he lost himselfe, and ran starke mad, wandring
vp and downe in the mountaines and woods,
and finding no comfort died miserably. When
he was dead, there were found in his scrip some
Orations and Epistles written to confirme the
rebells, filled with great promises of the <hi>Pope</hi>
and <hi>Spanyard.</hi> Thus Gods justice met with a rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
and wretched man, and that foule mouth was
<hi>stopped vp</hi> with famine, that was ever <hi>open</hi> to stirre
vp rebellions against the State that had vttered
so many blasphemies against God, and his holy
truth, and inuented so many strange lyes against
men. This man first of all men, devised a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
lye against the birth of the <hi>Queenes</hi> mother;
which none of her enemies ever heard or knew,
she being in the hatred of so many <hi>Papists,</hi> that
would not haue spared to haue spoken evill, yet
was it never heard or knowne for forty yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And the accompt of the time doth proue it

Two things are here conteined in
these words, which iump with these <hi>Priests</hi> and
<hi>Seminaries</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> sendeth forth; the <hi>doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine</hi>

at the commandement of the Pope or any superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or:</hi>
These I am sure are the practises of vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse;
would to God these men would once
looke backe vpon themselues and their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and consider what a difference is betweene
ancient Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> and these of late; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<hi>godly Divines</hi> and the <hi>Popes Clergie.</hi> The
ancient Bishops did never draw the sword to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate
the faith; the Apostles left no such exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to them, but by their labours in Preaching,
and their patience in suffring, they gathered a
Church and established the faith; but behold
how vnrighteousnes, and villany is now come in
place. An vngracious bloudy wretch kills a man
in his bed, a man that was his friend; such a thing
chancing in the Warres may be borne with, but
in bed to murther his friend, is an extraordinary
signe of barbarous crueltie: And yet that <hi>Sanders</hi>
the Popes Legat should pronounce this thing to
be a sweet sacrifice to God? this passeth all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.
Can any either practise these things,
or commend these practises, but onely such men
as the Apostle describeth, that are given vp to
beleeue lyes, and to worke vnrighteousnesse? If
any man shall answer me here with that old worn

and also some <hi>deceivablenesse of vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
What is that <hi>deceivablenesse of vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?</hi>
Surely there is something herein for them
to study, that are so ready at the <hi>Popes</hi> command
to doe vnrighteous things; and make not <hi>Gods
Word,</hi> but the <hi>Popes word</hi> to be the rule to know
what is righteous, what vnrighteous. When the

the law of <hi>our Land;</hi> when I say all lawes forbid
a thing, and onely the <hi>Pope</hi> commands it, and
commands it against all lawes; then if a man o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the <hi>Pope</hi> in such things, he is deceived and he
doth vnrighteously. <hi>Here is the deceivablenesse of
vnrighteousnesse.</hi> But you must vnderstand that
these men are thus deceived by him <hi>whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming

the truth will deliver them. And let them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
that maintaining of <hi>false doctrines</hi> and of
<hi>vnrighteous actions,</hi> are things ioyned together,
one followeth the other. Now because we see
false doctrines or lyes maintained by Papists, and
vnrighteous and vngracious actions by them or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily

the Scriptures are the Word of God. We beleeue
the Scriptures. We trust in God. We worship him
as himselfe hath revealed and commanded. If
our enemies wrong vs, we haue recourse to God
by prayer; we haue found by continuall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that God taketh the protection of them
that thus trust in him. We haue trusted in him,

necessary lawes were provided
against them. These in truth were
maintained by the adversaries of <hi>England</hi> as a <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary</hi>
of rebellion; for so still they proued.
Their first foundation was at <hi>Doway</hi> in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi>
where by the procuring of <hi>William Alan</hi>
an <hi>Oxford</hi>-man, afterward <hi>Cardinall,</hi> there was a
Colledge provided for them, in the yeare 1568.
Where fugitiue <hi>Priests</hi> were brought vp, not so
much in <hi>Religion,</hi> as in new and strange practises
of <hi>treason.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> assigned them a yearely sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.
Thus they stood for some yeares. But
when the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> began to be troubled
with Warres, <hi>Requesenius,</hi> who was governour
there vnder the <hi>Spanish</hi> King, did thrust out all
<hi>English</hi> fugitiues out of the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi>
Wherevpon they that were willing to make vse
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7927:36"/>
of such instruments to trouble <hi>England,</hi> thought
good to giue entertainment to them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
two Colledges were set vp for the <hi>English</hi> su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiues,
the one at <hi>Rhemes</hi> by the <hi>Guises,</hi> another
at <hi>Rome</hi> by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> 13. From these Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
they were sent into <hi>England</hi> vnder pretence of
Religion, but indeed to withdraw subiects from
obedience to their Prince, and to draw the Land
vnto the subiection of strangers: they called
themselues <hi>Seminaries,</hi> because they were to sowe
the seed of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion in <hi>England.</hi> And
what is that seed of <hi>Roman religion,</hi> but the seed of
<hi>Rebellion?</hi> Certainly so it hath euer proued.
These men to shew their zeale to their new
founders, and their hatred to their Country, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
and defined the <hi>Popes</hi> authoritie by Gods

Printing Bookes, to declare that the <hi>Pope</hi> and

            <p>
               <hi>Edmond Campian, Ralfe Sherwin, Luke Kirby,
Alexander Briant</hi> were taken in the yeare 1581.
and being brought to iudgement, were accused
of treason against the <hi>Queene</hi> and <hi>State;</hi> that they
were directed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> came into <hi>England</hi> to
stirre vp sedition, and to make a strong partie;
and herevpon they were condemned as offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
against the lawes. <hi>Campian</hi> was demanded
whether he tooke <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> to be <hi>Queene</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> by right and law? to that he refused to
answer. Then he was demanded, if the <hi>Pope</hi>
should send an Armie into <hi>England</hi> against the
<hi>Queene,</hi> whether he would take the <hi>Popes</hi> part, or
the <hi>Queenes?</hi> To this he protested openly, that he
would take the <hi>Popes</hi> part, and confirmed it by
his hand-writing; he was put to death and some
others for the same cause. When as yet from the
time of the rebellion, there was but fiue put to
death in this cause. The <hi>Queene</hi> thinking that
mens consciences should not be forced, did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7927:39"/>

               </gap>s she would suffer a mischiefe

               </gap> and <hi>Catholike</hi> Religion.
And yet she thought that some of the poore
<hi>Priests,</hi> that were sent, were not acquainted with
the secret plots of treason: but found that their
superiors vsed these as instruments of their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
intentions; and they yeelded the whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of themselues to the iudgement of their
superiors; for they that were then and afterward
apprehended, being demanded, whether by the
authoritie of the Bull of <hi>Pius</hi> V. the subiects were
so absolved from their oath and alleagance, that
they might take Armes against the Prince? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they held her for a lawfull <hi>Queene?</hi> Whether
they yeelded their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent to the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
&amp; <hi>Bristow,</hi> concerning the authoritie of that
Bull? Whether, if the <hi>Pope</hi> should warre against
the <hi>Queene,</hi> they would take his part or hers?
To these things they answered, some so ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
some so fiercely, some by preuarication or
by silence shifting: that diverse other <hi>Papists</hi> who
were not acquainted with the secrets of their
villanies, began to suspect, that surely they nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
some secret mischiefe: and <hi>Iohn Bishop,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
much addicted to their Religion, wrote
and soundly proued that the constitution ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the name of the <hi>Councell of Lateran,</hi> from
which they founded all their authoritie to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
subiects from their alleagance, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

Princes, was indeed nothing but a decree of
<hi>Innocentius</hi> III. nor was ever admitted in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
Yea, that Councell was no Councell, and
that nothing was decreed there by the Fathers.</p>
            <p>Suspitions were still increased, by reason of the
number of <hi>Priests</hi> daily comming into <hi>England,</hi>
and creeping in corners, who secretly sought out
the minds of men, and taught that Princes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
were to be throwne out of their
Kingdomes, that Princes that professed not the
<hi>Roman</hi> Religion, were fallen from the title and
Kingly authoritie, that they who had taken or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
were by the libertie of the Church freed
from all iurisdiction of Princes, neither were
bound to their lawes, or bound to reverence
their Maiestie: that the Magistrates of <hi>England</hi>
were not lawfull, and therefore not to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as Magistrates. Yea, and moreover, that what
things soever had bin established by the <hi>Queenes</hi>
authoritie, after the publishing of the Bull of
<hi>Pius</hi> V. were voyd altogether by Gods law and
mans law, and to be respected as things of no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
Neither did they dissemble their purpose,
that they were come into <hi>England</hi> for this end,
that this Bull might be effected, and that they
might in private confessions reconcile men, and
so absolue them from all faith and alleagance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the <hi>Queene.</hi> This thing seemed to be more
easily effected, when men were absolved from all
mortall sinne, as the <hi>Priests</hi> perswaded them, and
this way was the safest, because the most secret,
and vnder the seale of Confession.</p>

the same punishment was to be inflicted vpon

the State of the Church in S. <hi>Augustines</hi>
time, and the iudgement of the Church then,
which in diverse resemblances doth answer to
our times; for then the Emperour had that power
and authoritie, which we now giue to our Kings.
The Pope had no more authoritie then, then we
would yeeld him now, if he would maintaine
the doctrine that the Popes then did. The <hi>Pope</hi>
was then vnder the <hi>Emperour;</hi> the Emperour
punished both Pope and others if they offended
his lawes. <hi>Parmenianus,</hi> a Donatist, complained
they were punished by the Emperour, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
and called their persecution Martyrdome,
as did the Papists that were punished. S. <hi>Augustin</hi>
answering the <hi>Donatists,</hi> saith: <hi>Si quis quis ab Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratore,
&amp;c.</hi> 
               <q>If every man that is punished by the

that in some question of Religion is punished
by the Emperour, must presently be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Martyr; for he is iustly punished for <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,</hi>
which he thought to be <hi>religion.</hi> No
man verily that in any respect is a Christian,
dare avouch this; for such men proceeding
like blind men, see not, that they who thus
thinke, proceed so farre, as to proue that the

<hi>Charles Arundell,</hi> a Courtier, secretly fled the land,
and went into <hi>France.</hi> These men meeting with
other devoted to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, did much
complaine, recounting their sorrowes among
themselues, that the <hi>Queene</hi> was estranged from
them without their fault, by the cunning of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
and <hi>Walsingham,</hi> that them selues were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to vnworthy contumelies &amp; ignominies,
that singular tricks were found out, and secret
snares laid so cunningly, that improvident men,
will they nill they, must needs be intangled in
such snares; that to remaine at home there could
be no safety for them. It was thought at this
time, that some cunning was practised to feele
mens affections; and that counterfeit Letters
were written vnder the name of the <hi>Scots Queene,</hi>
and of some fugitiues, knowne traytors to the
State; which Letters might be left in the houses
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7927:42"/>
of Recusans, and that spies were sent abroad to
gather rumors, and to catch suspitions. Diverse
were drawne into snares. Among others, <hi>Henry</hi>
Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and his sonne <hi>Philip</hi>
Earle of <hi>Arundell,</hi> was commanded to keepe his
house, his wife was committed to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

was often examined of Letters sent from the
<hi>Scots Queene,</hi> from <hi>Charles Paget,</hi> and from one
<hi>Mope,</hi> then vnknowne. Some blamed the narrow
searching of things, and the manner of drawing
men into danger. Others thought that all the
means that might be vsed to prevent the <hi>Queenes</hi>
danger, and to saue her life, was but necessary.
And indeed the outragious maliciousnes of the
Papists against the <hi>Queene,</hi> brake out daily; for
by Bookes imprinted, they exhorted the <hi>Queenes
maides</hi> and <hi>Ladies of honor</hi> to doe the same against
the Queene, which <hi>Iudith</hi> did against <hi>Holofernes.</hi>
The Author of that Booke was not found, <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
Martin</hi> was suspected, a man learned in the
Greeke and Latin tongues, and chosen by the
Duke to be the bringer vp of his children.
<hi>Carter</hi> the Stationer that caused the Books to be
Printed, was punished for it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Queene,</hi> that was much traduced for cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie,
knowing her owne mildnes, and desirous
to leaue a good remembrance of her name be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
her, was much offended with the Iudges
of the Papists apprehended, if they passed any
cruell sentences against them, which might be
iniurious to her honor. Insomuch that they were
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7927:43"/>
forced to excuse themselues by publike writings,
wherein they protested, that the Priests were
much more mildly vsed then they deserved: that
no question of Religion was moued to them, but
onely of such pernicious machinations against
their Country, against their Prince, whereof they
were either found guiltie, or by the discovery of
others, suspected. That <hi>Campian</hi> was never so
racked, but that presently he was able to walke,
or to subscribe to his confessions. But for <hi>Briant,</hi>
who stubbornly denied to vtter by speech or by
writing, who was the man that wrote these secret
things which were found about him; to this man
meat was denied, vntill by writing he would aske
it. For all this the <hi>Queene</hi> was not satisfied, and
therefore she commanded the <hi>Examiners</hi> to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine
from <hi>tormenting</hi> men, and the <hi>Iudges</hi> from
<hi>punishing.</hi> And short after, she commanded <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventie
Priests</hi> to be sent out of <hi>England,</hi> whereof
some were condemned to die, all of them were
intangled within the danger of the lawes. The
chiefe of these were <hi>Gasper Haywod,</hi> the sonne of

Stafford,</hi> the Ambassadour Leiger there for
Queene <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> but he could not find out
what they practised; yet he dealt with the French
King, that <hi>they, Morgan,</hi> and some other English
fugitiues, who were knowne to be practisers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Prince, and their Country, might be
thrust out of <hi>France.</hi> But it was answered, that if
they practised any thing in <hi>France,</hi> the King
would by law punish them, but if they had prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
any thing in <hi>England,</hi> that of such things
the King could take no notice, nor by law punish
them: that all Kingdomes were free for fugitiues,
that it behooued Kings to maintaine their owne
liberties: That <hi>Elizabeth</hi> not long before had
admitted into her Kingdome <hi>Montgomery,</hi> the
Prince of <hi>Condie,</hi> and others of the French Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that <hi>Segneres</hi> Ambassadour of the King
of <hi>Navarre</hi> was in <hi>England,</hi> practising of some
things that concerned the French state.</p>
            <p>In the meane time <hi>Bernardinus Mendoza</hi> the
King of <hi>Spaine</hi> his Ambassadour for <hi>England,</hi>
stole fecretly into <hi>France,</hi> fretting and fuming,
that he was thrust out of <hi>England</hi> by a violation
of the right of an Ambassadour: When as indeed
he was a man of a troublesome spirit, and had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused
the reuerend right of Ambassadours, by
the practises of treason against this State wherein
he was. He was commanded to depart out of the
realme, whereas many thought fit that he should
haue beene with some severity censured for vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
the office of an Ambassadour. For he had
practised with <hi>Throgmorton,</hi> and others, to bring
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7927:44"/>
in strangers into <hi>England,</hi> to invade the land, and
to remoue the <hi>Queene.</hi> And being gently reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
for these things, he was so far from offering
to excuse these things with a modest answer, that
he began to accuse the <hi>Queene</hi> and the <hi>Councell,</hi>
for the money taken from the Merchants of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nua,</hi>
and for helping the <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi>
of the Count <hi>Antow,</hi> of <hi>Antony</hi> of <hi>Portugall,</hi> and
charged them with the spoyles that S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis
Drake</hi> had taken from the <hi>Spany trds</hi> in the west
<hi>Indies.</hi> But that the <hi>Spanyard</hi> might the better
vnderstand, that this which Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
had done in sending away <hi>Mendoza,</hi> was no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
of an Ambassadour, but a censure of <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doza</hi>
his wicked practises, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>William Wade</hi> was
sent to <hi>Spaine,</hi> who might plainly informe the
King, how vnworthily he had behaved himselfe
in his Ambassage: and might also signifie, that
the <hi>Queene</hi> would not haue this sending away of
him to be interpreted a renuntiation of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
but that she would maintaine all offices of
humanitie, if he would send any other, that were
carefull to conserue friendship betweene them,
so that the like offices were performed to her
Ambassadour in <hi>Spaine.</hi> The <hi>Spanish</hi> King would
not admit <hi>Wade</hi> to his presence, but referred him
to his Councell: <hi>Wade</hi> herevpon declared boldly,
that the custome was received among Nations,
that even in burning warre, Ambassadours were
admitted into presence of their enemies: &amp; that
<hi>Charles the fift</hi> Emperour, Father to the King of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> admitted into his presence an Herald
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7927:44"/>
who denounced to him warres from the <hi>French</hi>
King, and denied to communicate the instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his ambassage to his Councellers. <hi>I diacius</hi>
the Kings secretary could by no cunning fish out
of <hi>Wade</hi> what were his instructions, vntill he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the whole matter from <hi>Mendoza,</hi> then
lurking in <hi>France.</hi> Then the Secretary laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
his publike person, did familiarly declare to
S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>William Wade,</hi> that he was sorry that some men
did labour craftily to dissolue friendship among
Princes, and to nourish hatred betweene them;
The iniury that was done, was not done to the
Ambassadours but to the <hi>Catholike</hi> King: that
there was no cause for him to accuse <hi>Mendoza</hi> to
the King, who was sufficiently punished with an
ignominious extrusion out of <hi>England,</hi> for the
fault, if there were any, which he committed.
Neither might he complaine if he were not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
for the <hi>Catholike</hi> King did nothing herein
but quit like with like, seeing <hi>Mendoza</hi> was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed
from the <hi>Queene,</hi> vnheard. And as she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<hi>Mendoza</hi> to her Councell, so the King had
referred him to the <hi>Cardinall Granuillanus. Wade</hi>
answered, there was great difference in their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
for himselfe <hi>he</hi> had never offended the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi>
King: but <hi>Mendoza</hi> had grievously offended
against the <hi>Queene,</hi> and for a long time through
his owne insolency disdained to come, and had
committed many things vnworthy the office of
an Ambassadour; yet he could not be admitted,
but returned vnheard. The crimes that he would
haue obiected against <hi>Mendoza,</hi> were taken our
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7927:45"/>
of the confession of <hi>Throgmorton.</hi>

Throgmorton,</hi> when he was apprehended, sent
priuily one packet of letters to <hi>Mendoza.</hi> His o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
packets being sought and opened, there
were two Catalogues found; In the one of them
were the names of all the <hi>havens</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that
were for forces to land in: In the other were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the names of the <hi>Noble-men,</hi> which here
and there throughout <hi>England</hi> favoured the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Religion. These papers when <hi>Throgmorton</hi>
saw produced, he cryed out that they were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited,
that he had never seene them before,
that they were devised for his destruction. But
when he was againe brought to the racke, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
not to answer what he knew to the questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
proposed. Being therefore demanded of those
<hi>Catalogues,</hi> to what purpose they had beene writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
he made this narration; that not many yeares
since he went to the <hi>Spaw water,</hi> where, with <hi>Ieney</hi>
and <hi>Fr: Inglefeld,</hi> he had counsell and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
how <hi>England</hi> might be taken by strangers,
and the forme of the government changed. For
that purpose he described the names of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and of Noble-men; that <hi>Morgan</hi> had certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
him by Letters out of <hi>France,</hi> that the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Princes</hi> were resolved to invade <hi>England,</hi> that
the <hi>Queene of Scots</hi> should be set at libertie by the
forces of the <hi>Guises.</hi> To this proiect there was
nothing wanting but money, and the helpe that
was expected out of <hi>England.</hi> To effect this the
better, <hi>Charles Paget,</hi> vnder the name of <hi>Mope,</hi> was
secretly sent into <hi>Sussex,</hi> where the <hi>Guise</hi> purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7927:45"/>
to take land: that he had communicated the
matter to <hi>Mendoza,</hi> and told him the names of
the noble-men, who knew all these things before
fully of the conspirators: Neither denied he that
himselfe had promised his help to <hi>Mendoza,</hi> and
withall that he admonished <hi>Mendoza</hi> of those
Nobles that were fit for him being a publike per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to deale withall, which himselfe being a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
man could not doe without danger. And
that he had taken order with him, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

chiefe <hi>Catholikes,</hi> as soone as ever the forraine
forces drew neare, should muster souldiers in the
<hi>Queenes</hi> name, who should ioyn themselues with
the forraine forces. Thus much he confessed wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</p>
            <p>Yet when he came to iudgement in the <hi>Guild
Hall</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> he denied all, &amp; said that all these
were fained devises to saue him from the racke,

               </gap>d the <hi>Queene</hi> of <hi>crueltie,</hi> the
<hi>examiners</hi> of <hi>falshood;</hi> seeking a starting hole from
the space of time which passed between the time
of the committing his crime, and the time of his
iudgement; for in the XIII. of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
crimes are made treason, for which no man
should be called in question, vnles the delinquent
were accused within six moneths after the crime
committed, and the crime were proued by wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and oath of two, or by the partie his owne
free confession. Now he pleaded that this time
was past, and therefore that he was not to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
into iudgment. But the Iudges answered and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7927:46"/>
shewed that the crimes obiected against him, were
of another kind; for he had offended against an
old law of treason made in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> 3.
which admitteth no circumscription of time, or
proofe. And from that law he was condemned.
Afterward being perswaded and better thinking
on the matter, he craued the <hi>Queenes</hi> mercy, and
by writing confessed all at full againe, which he
had done before: and as a man vnconstant, began
to deny againe at the gallowes.</p>

wicked and treasonable practises might be in

A great number throughout all <hi>England,</hi> of all

shewed their loue and care of the <hi>Queene:</hi> bound
themselues by an <hi>association</hi> (as then it was called)
by their mutuall promises, subscriptions of their

thing against the life of the <hi>Queene:</hi> the Earle
of <hi>Leicester</hi> was supposed to be the author of this

in order. The <hi>Queene of Scots</hi> tooke this as devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to bring her into danger, and was so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
set on by seditious spirits, that if they may

but to bring great personages and great hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to ruine? Lamentable experience sheweth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
the fruit of their malice, and wicked plots
for treason; which they call religion. The <hi>Scots
Queene</hi> led on by her blind guids, dealt somwhat
rashly, but with importunity to the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyard,</hi>
by S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Inglefeld,</hi> that by all meanes

they would with speed, vndertake their intended
busines. There were some also that laboured to
draw Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> affections altogether
from the <hi>Scots Queene;</hi> They told her that <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Alan</hi> for the English <hi>Catholikes ecclesiasticall,
Inglefeld</hi> for the <hi>Laiks,</hi> and for the <hi>Queene of Scots,</hi>
the <hi>Bishop of Ross</hi> had vndertaken, &amp; were among
themselues agreed, and with the consent also of
the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Spanyard,</hi> had fully resolved vpon
these points: That <hi>Queene Elizabeth should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of her Kingdome; the King of Scots as a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
favourer of heresie, should vtterly be disinherited
of the Kingdome of England; that the Scots Queene
shall marry some noble-man of England, which is a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike;
that this man must be chosen King of England
by the Catholikes of England; that the choice so made
must be confirmed by the Pope; that the children of him
so chosen begotten of the Scots Queene, must be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
successours in the Kingdome.</hi> All these things
were confirmed to be true by testimony of <hi>Hart</hi>
the Priest. Who was this noble English man, that
should marry the <hi>Scots Queene,</hi> was now much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

was suspition of <hi>Henry Howard,</hi> brother to the
Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> who was noble by birth, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married,
and a favourer of that Religion, and in
great grace and favour with them.</p>
            <p>These things that were discovered by <hi>Throg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton,</hi>
by <hi>Creightons</hi> papers, and <hi>other mens,</hi> were
matters which bred suspitions and feares though
they were never so effected as they were inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7927:47"/>
But we find by these things, that <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Spaine,</hi> and the strength of the <hi>Pope,</hi> were here all
combined against <hi>Queene Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>King
Iames,</hi> for no other cause, but for their religion;
because both <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>King Iames,</hi>
had established the same religion. Against which
religion all the great powers of the world were
combined, and were therefore ready with their
vtmost indevours to root out these two Princes
from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi> If a man shall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Councels, the Pollicies, the strength of
these great powers which were set against these
two Princes, it is a matter to be wondred at, how
they should stand against so deepe and desperate
dangers. Here I wish that a <hi>Papist</hi> of any vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
would take this matter into his conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
And looke but a little further to the end
and event of things. What man purposed, What
God wrought. What became of these two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>Queene Elizabeth &amp; King Iames,</hi> against whom
the world thus conspired? <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> after
so many malicious proiects against her, by open

the malicious practises against her, <hi>defeated</hi> and
<hi>overthrowne,</hi> the practisers themselues <hi>ruinated,</hi>
her people and Kingdome <hi>defended,</hi> Gods truth
<hi>maintained,</hi> her service for the truth <hi>rewarded,</hi> and
after all, dyed quietly in her bed, and hath left a
blessed memory behinde her. King IAMES that
was in the same cause with her, in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
threatned for his Religion, to be made inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the inheritance of <hi>England,</hi> and then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7927:48"/>
could he haue holden <hi>Scotland,</hi> for he must
either haue all his right, or loose all; for there is
no middle-way in the inheritance of Kings: yet
after all these threatned dangers by the great
powers of the world, after a number of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and devilish practises against him at home;
he hath not onely quietly possessed that which
he had, but is in the peaceable possession of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
with such loue, such gladnesse of heart and
common reioycing, that the like hath not beene
knowne in former times. And which was never
done by any before, though much wished, and
attempted: he hath in his royall person knit
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> together; he hath not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
maintained the truth of Religion by his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
as all Christian Princes are bound to do;
but also by his <hi>wisedome,</hi> by his <hi>learning</hi> confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the truth, drawne many to the knowledge
of it by his learned Labours. Wherein he hath
not onely farre exceeded all his progenitours in
this Kingdome, but hath left all the Kings and
Emperours in the world farre behind him in this
honour; so that since the beginning of the time
of grace, to this day, the world never saw a King
so furnished and inabled to maintaine the <hi>truth,</hi>
and to discover the blindnesse and superstition
of <hi>false Religion.</hi> And therefore hath God blessed
him with extraordinary blessings; the loue of his

his time was never governed in peace, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the fruit of Religion, and the reward of

thereof: We therefore remember these things
with great gladnesse and ioy of heart to Gods
glory, giving thankes to his holy name, for the
favours that he hath exhibited to his Church
here, by the faithfull service of these two royall
servants of God, in whom is truely verified that
which the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> foretold, speaking of
Gods favour to his Church: <hi>Kings shall be thy
nurcing Fathers, and Queenes shall be thy Nurces.</hi>
In these things we can lift vp our hearts to God,
and giue him the glory and thankes for all his
goodnesse. But can our adversaries doe the like,
whose practises against these noble Princes, were
wicked and malicious, and by God confounded?
Let men see and confesse the hand of God in

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7927:49"/>
man he dealt with <hi>Neuil,</hi> whom he knew to be a
man discontented and suspected, as he had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
the <hi>Queene,</hi> he might haue avoyded the
danger; but they who in their heart once haue
given intertainment to wickednesse and treason,
though otherwise they be of wit and sharpe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
are made blind, by a iust iudgement
of God. Now when as <hi>Neuil</hi> had no witnesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Parry:</hi> there was no great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<hi>Parry</hi> his word and <hi>his.</hi> But <hi>Parry,</hi> after
some sharpe wordes had passed betweene them;
was imprisoned in the Tower. Where he freely
confessed thus much.</p>
            <p>In the yeare 1570. <hi>(said he)</hi> I was admitted a
sworn servant to the <hi>Queene,</hi> I remained devoted
to her Maiestie till the yeare 1580. At what time
I fell into great danger of my life, with great ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy,
(for he had broken into the chamber
of <hi>Hugh Hare,</hi> in whose debt he was, and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him, wherevpon being condemned by law,
his life was saved by the <hi>Queenes</hi> pardon) after
that, I liued much vexed in my minde, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
leaue to trauell, I went into <hi>France;</hi> and had
no purpose to returne, because I had given my
selfe to the <hi>Catholike</hi> Religion. At <hi>Paris</hi> I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled;
At <hi>Venice</hi> I had communication with
<hi>Benedict Palmius</hi> a Iesuit, touching the afflicted
<hi>Catholikes</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and I signified that I had
found out a way to helpe them, if the <hi>Pope,</hi> or
some learned Divines would avouch it to be a
lawfull course. He commended this thing as pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
He commended me to <hi>Campegius</hi> the Popes
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7927:50"/>

               </gap>.
Wherevpon Letters of publike credence were
sent to me by the Cardinall of <hi>Come:</hi> but these
were not large enough, and therefore other more
large were sent. But then was I returned into
<hi>France.</hi> Where meeting with <hi>Morgan,</hi> he signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that there was an expectation, that I should
performe some especiall service to God, and to
the <hi>Catholike</hi> Church. I answered, that I was
most ready to kill, if it were the greatest subiect
of <hi>England.</hi> O but (said he) and why not the
<hi>Queene</hi> her selfe? I said that this also might be
easily done, so that it might appeare to be lawfull.
For <hi>Watt</hi> a Priest, whose advise I asked in this
matter, suppressing the names, told me plainly,
that it was not lawfull, (and <hi>Creighton</hi> the Iesuit
is of the same opinion, teaching that <hi>evill must
not be done, that good may come:</hi> that God is more
delighted with <hi>aduerbs</hi> than <hi>nounes,</hi> and the thing
that is done <hi>well</hi> and lawfully pleaseth him better
then a thing <hi>good:</hi> and that by the destruction of
one, many soules are not to be redeemed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an expresse commandement of God.) Yet
for all this seeing I had in <hi>Italy</hi> bound my selfe
by Letters and promise, I could not goe backe,
if the <hi>Pope</hi> did approue it, and would grant me a
plenary indulgence. Which I requested in my
Letters to the <hi>Pope,</hi> by <hi>Ragazonius</hi> the Popes
<hi>Nuntio</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> Who commended the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise,
and sent my Letters to <hi>Rome.</hi> Being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into <hi>England,</hi> I gat accesse to the <hi>Queene.</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:7927:50"/>
And all being remoued, I opened the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy,
yet hiding many things, with as great
art as possibly I could. She heard it vndaunted,
vnterrified. I departed daunted and terrified Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can I forget that which she said, that no <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes</hi>
were to be brought into question for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
or for the <hi>Popes</hi> supremacy, so that they
carry themselues as good subiects. In this time
whilst I stayed daily in Court, seeking to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
with the mastership of S. <hi>Katharines,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Letters from the Cardinall of <hi>Come,</hi>
wherein the attempt was commended, and I was
absolved in the <hi>Popes</hi> name. These Letters I
shewed the <hi>Queene;</hi> how they did worke with her
I know not: but with me they wrought so farre,
that they set a new courage in me to attempt the
interprise, and tooke all scruple out of my mind;
yet it was not my minde to offer any force, if by
any reasons she might be perswaded to deale
more gently with <hi>Catholikes.</hi> And to the end I
should not commit slaughter, alwayes when I
had accesse to her I layd aside my dagger. So oft
as I considered her and her Princely vertues, I
was distracted by an ambiguous care, for my
vowes were in heaven, my letters and promises
with men. And to my selfe I revolved these
things in my minde. She never deserved well of
me. It is true she pardoned my life; but for such
a cause to take away my life, were tyrannicall.
Thus not content with my state, I departed from
Court; and I light vpon Doct. <hi>Alans</hi> Booke,
written against the iustice of <hi>England.</hi> Who tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7927:51"/>
that Princes being excommunicate for
heresie, are to be despoiled of their Kingdomes
and liues: that Booke did very sharply stirre me
vp to finish mine attempt; I read this Booke to
<hi>Neuil,</hi> whom I entertained at my table; and this
was done full six moneths before he accused me.
After this he came to me, And let vs dare, said
he, to doe something, seeing of the <hi>Queene</hi> we
can obtaine nothing. And he proposed some
things of the delivery of the <hi>Scots Queene.</hi> I did
here interpose; O but I haue a greater matter in
my head, and more profitable for the <hi>Catholike</hi>
Church. The next day he came, and swearing
vpon the Bible, that he would keepe my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
and constantly prosecute whatsoever was
vsefull for the <hi>Catholike</hi> Religion. And I sware in
like sort. Our determination was to set vpon the
<hi>Queene</hi> with ten horsemen as she was riding in the
fields, and so to kill her. Which thing <hi>Neuil</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
all this while. But when the newes came,
that the Earle of <hi>Westmerland</hi> was dead, whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
he hoped to haue presently, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting
his oath, he opened these things against
me. These things <hi>Parry</hi> confessed, in the presence
of the Lord <hi>Hunsdon,</hi> Sir <hi>Christopher Harton,</hi> and
Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham,</hi> privie Councellers, and
farther by his Letters to the <hi>Queene,</hi> to <hi>Burghley</hi>
Lord Treasurer, and to the Earle of <hi>Leicester,</hi> he
acknowledged his fault and craued pardon.</p>
            <p>Some few dayes after he was brought to <hi>VVest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
hall to iudgement. Where the heads of
his accusation being read, he confessed himselfe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7927:51"/>
guiltie. Sir <hi>Christohper Hatton,</hi> to satisfie the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>de
present, thought it fit, that the crime
should punctually be opened out of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.
Which <hi>Parry</hi> himselfe acknowledged to
be free, not extorted: and the Iudges intreated
that he would reade them. But the Clarke of the
Crowne read them: and the Letters of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
of <hi>Come,</hi> &amp; <hi>Parry</hi> his Letters to the <hi>Queene,</hi>
to the Lord <hi>Burghley,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Leicester,</hi>
all which he granted to be true. Yet he denied
that he was at any time resolved to kill the
<hi>Queene.</hi> He was therefore commanded to speake,
if he had any thing to say why iudgement should
not passe. Here he answered with perturbation,
as one troubled with the conscience of the crime,
<hi>I see I must die, because I was not resolved.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
desired to speake more plainly, if he would
say any thing; <hi>My bloud,</hi> said he, <hi>be among you.</hi>
When sentence of death was pronounced against
him, he ragingly cited the <hi>Queene</hi> to the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
seat of God. Being brought to the gallowes,
he bragged much that he had beene a faithfull
keeper of the <hi>Queene,</hi> because he had not killed
her. Thus like a glorious <hi>Roman Catholike,</hi> never
once in one word co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending himselfe to God,
he died like a traytor in the court before <hi>VVest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi>
Hall, where the Lords and Commons
were then assembled in Parliament.</p>
            <p>In this Parliament some lawes were enacted for
the <hi>Queenes</hi> safety against the <hi>Iesuites</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi>
who attempted daily horrible treasons from the
Bull of <hi>Pius V.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:7927:52"/>It was therefore enacted that within forty daies
they should all depart the Land. If any came in
againe after that, and stayed here, they should
be guilty of treason: that if any received them
wittingly and willingly, or interteined them,
nourished, or helped them, such should be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of fellony: that they who are brought vp in
the <hi>seminaries,</hi> if they returne not within sixe
monethes after warning given, and should not
submit themselues to the <hi>Queene,</hi> before a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
or two Iustices of peace, they should be
guiltie of treason. And they who had submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
if they should within ten yeares come to
the Court, or nearer then ten miles of the
Court, that then their submission should be
voyd. They who sent any money by any means
to the Students of the <hi>seminaries,</hi> should be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Praemunire. If any of the Peeres of the
Realme, that is, Dukes, Marquesses, Earles, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
Barons of the Parliament, should offend
against these lawes, he should be tryed by his
Peeres. They who know any <hi>Iesuites</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi>
to lye lurking in the Realme, and within twelue
dayes doe not detect them, shall be fined at the
<hi>Queenes</hi> pleasure, and put in prison. If any be
suspected to be one of those <hi>Iesuites</hi> or <hi>Priests,</hi>
and shall not submit himselfe to examination,
for his contempt he shall be imprisoned, vntill
he submit. He that shall send any Christian, or
any other to the <hi>Seminaries</hi> and Colledges of
the Popish profession, shall be fined an hundreth
pounds. They that are so sent, shall not succeed
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7927:52"/>
in inheritance, nor inioy any goods what way
soever they may chance. And so shall it be to
them that within a yeare returne not from
those <hi>seminaries;</hi> vnlesse they conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> If the keepers
of havens permit any to passe the seas without
the <hi>Queenes</hi> licence, or the licence of six Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellers,
except Mariners and Merchants, they
shall be remoued from their places; the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master
that carries them shall loose the Shipp
and all the goods in her, and be imprisoned a
whole yeare.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The severitie of these lawes (which were no
lesse then necessary for such times and such mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes)
made the <hi>Papists</hi> in <hi>England</hi> afeard, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
others, <hi>Philip Howard,</hi> Earle of <hi>Arundell;</hi>
in so much as fearing least he might offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those lawes, he purposed to leaue his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
He had his bloud restored by the <hi>Queenes</hi>
favour three yeares before. And after that being
dis-favoured by reason of some secret suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of certaine great personages against him, he
secretly gaue himselfe to the <hi>Popish</hi> Religion, and
made choice of an austere life. Surely if good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structours
might haue beene admitted to him, he
might haue beene easily and happily confirmed
in the truth. He was once or twice called before
the Councell table, and refuted the things obi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him. Yet was he commanded to keepe his
house. Six moneths after he was set at libertie,
and came to the Parliament; but the first day,
whilst the Sermon was preached he withdrew
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7927:53"/>
himselfe out of the company. The Parliament
being ended, being as then resolved to depart,
he wrote to the <hi>Queene</hi> a long and a mournfull
complaint, which Letters he commanded should
be delivered after his departure: he complained
of the envie of his potent adversaries, wherevnto
he was forced to yeeld; seeing they triumphed
over his innocency. He recounted the vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
destinies of his ancestors, of his great grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father,
condemned his cause not being heard: of
his grand-father, who for matters of small mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was beheaded; and of his father, whom he
affirmed to be circumvented by his adversaries,
who yet never had an evill minde against his
<hi>Prince</hi> nor <hi>Countrey.</hi> As for himselfe, least he
should succeed the heire of his fathers infelicitie,
said he, to the end that he might serue God, and
provide for the health of his soule, he had forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
his Countrey, but not his alleagance to his
Prince. After these Letters were delivered, he
went into <hi>Sussex,</hi> and having provided a shippe,
in an obscure corner, and now being ready to
take ship, he was apprehended by the mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of
those whom he trusted, and by the master of the
ship discovered, and was sent into the Tower as
a prisoner.</p>

<hi>Northumberland</hi> in the Tower, sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to be of councell with <hi>Throg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton,</hi>
and the Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> and the
<hi>Guises,</hi> to invade <hi>England,</hi> and to free the <hi>Scots
Queene.</hi> He was found dead in his bed, shot with
three Bullets vnder his left pap: the chamber
doore bolted on the inside. The <hi>Crowners</hi> enquest
found a dagge, and gun powder in the chamber,
and examining the man that bought the dagge,
and him that sold it, they found that the Earle
had beene the cause of his owne death. Three
dayes after the Lords met in the <hi>Starre-chamber.</hi>
The Lord Chancelour <hi>Broumley,</hi> briefly declared
that the Earle had entred into treasonable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
against his Prince and Countrey, which now
when he perceived that they were come to light,
troubled in conscience for the thing, hath offred
force to himselfe. And to satisfie the multitude
then present, he willed the <hi>Queenes</hi> Atturney ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
and the rest of the <hi>Queenes</hi> Councell,
plainly to open the causes why he was kept in
prison, and the manner of his death. Wherevpon
<hi>Popham</hi> then <hi>Atturney,</hi> beginning from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
of the North sixteene yeares before, he
declared, that for this rebellion and for a purpose
to deliver the <hi>Scots Queene,</hi> that he was called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
question, acknowledged his fault, submitted
himselfe to the <hi>Queenes</hi> mercy, was fined fiue

thousand markes. That the <hi>Queene</hi> of her cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie
tooke not of that fine so much as a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and after his brothers death confirmed
him in the honor of the <hi>Earledome.</hi> Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all this, he had entred into pernicious
counsel to deliver the <hi>Scots Queene,</hi> to overthrow
the <hi>English Queene,</hi> with the State and Religion:
that <hi>Mendoza</hi> the Spaniard had told <hi>Throgmorton</hi>
that <hi>Charles Paget</hi> vnder the name of <hi>Mope,</hi> had
secretly dealt with him in <hi>Sussex</hi> of these things:
that the Lord <hi>Paget</hi> had signified the same to
<hi>Throgmorton,</hi> as appeared from <hi>Creighton</hi> the
<hi>Scots</hi> Iesuites papers. And that <hi>Charles Paget</hi> had
shewed the same things to <hi>William Shelley</hi> when
he returned out of <hi>France.</hi> After that, <hi>Egerton</hi>
the Queenes <hi>Sollicitour,</hi> inferred the same from
circumstances, and a care of concealing the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
That when as there was none in <hi>England</hi> that
could accuse the Earle of this crime, except the
Lord <hi>Paget;</hi> (with whom <hi>Throgmorton</hi> had fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie)
he had provided a shippe for the Lord
<hi>Paget,</hi> by <hi>Shelley,</hi> a few dayes after <hi>Throgmorton</hi>
was apprehended. So was the Lord <hi>Paget</hi> sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
into <hi>France.</hi> And when <hi>Throgmorton</hi> began
to confesse some things, the <hi>Earle</hi> departed from
<hi>London</hi> to <hi>Petworth,</hi> and sending for <hi>Shelley,</hi> told
him that he was in danger of his life and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
he intreated him to keepe counsell, and to
put away those that knew of the departure of the
Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> and of the comming of <hi>Charles Paget.</hi>
Which was presently done, and himselfe sent far
off that servant which he vsed to send to <hi>Charles
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7927:54"/>
Paget.</hi> The <hi>Sollicitour</hi> addeth, that when he was
in prison, he dealt often with <hi>Shelley,</hi> the keepers
being corrupted, to vnderstand what those
things were which he had confessed. But when
by a poore woman secretly sent betweene them,
<hi>Shelley</hi> had signified, that he could keepe counsell
no longer, that there was great differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce between
their two conditions; that he must come vnder
the racke, which the Earle in respect of his place
and order was freed from, and had written to him
what he had confessed: The Earle therevpon
sighed and said, as <hi>Pantin</hi> his Chamberlain hath
confessed, that <hi>Shelley</hi> his confession had vndone
him. After the manner of his death was declared
by the testimony of the <hi>Enquest,</hi> and by <hi>Pantins</hi>
testimony. Many good men were very sorrowfull,
that a man of such nobility, wisdome, and valour
was so lost.</p>
            <p>My purpose is in this Narration, to obserue the
great and manifold deliverances of this Church.
When I am drawne by the course of the History
to open these practises, in which noblemen haue
beene misled: this I confesse I relate with great
commiseration; for seeing that <hi>Noble houses</hi> are
the <hi>honor</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>ornament</hi> of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
there is no man that loueth the honor of
his owne Country, that can write or speake of
the fall of such men, but with griefe and sorrow.
Of such I will make no other observations, but
onely the testification of mine owne sorrow But
yet here I must obserue one thing for the good
and instruction of their posteritie, or the like, that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7927:55"/>
they may take heed of these pernicious instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>Priests, Iesuites,</hi> and those that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
yea and poysoned with the infection of
them. These gracelesse merchants haue vtterly
vndone many noble persons, which without
their restlesse suggestions and councels, might
and doubtlesse would haue bin great ornaments
of their Countries both in peace and warres.
Was there ever any noble house in these times
ruinated, without the practise of these wicked
miscreants? Let all the bloud that hath bin shed
in this Land in the <hi>Northern rebellion,</hi> &amp; at other
times, be laid vpon these wicked instruments of
bloud. And let the world consider the outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
wickednesse of this generation, that having
in formertimes sucked the bloud of the Saints
as greedy instruments of the <hi>great Whore,</hi> that is
<hi>drunke with the bloud of the Saints:</hi> now by a iust,
but strange iudgement of God, they are fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such practises, as shed their owne bloud and
the bloud of such as are misled by them. God is
to be reverenced in all his iudgements, and let
not <hi>men</hi> striue against <hi>God</hi> to maintaine a cause
which God will overthrow, with all the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
thereof.</p>
            <p>And it is not much to be marveiled, if these
cunning stirrers haue deceiued some of our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
for we see that they haue cousened great
Kings and Princes. For soone after this in the
yeare 1586.<note place="margin">An: Do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 1586.</note> these pernicious medlers, these <hi>Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi>
shewed themselues in other colours, for when
these bloudy instruments that had so long la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7927:55"/>
the ruine of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; were out of hope
to restore the <hi>Romish Religion</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> either
by the <hi>Scots Queene,</hi> which was now more strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kept, or by the King then of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who had
plainly professed and established the Gospell in
his Kingdome: they fell now to a new and a
strange practise, which might make the world to
wonder: they began out of their false and lying
forgeries, to set a foot an imaginary title of the
King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to the right and succession of the
<hi>English</hi> Crowne. To this purpose, as <hi>Pasquirus</hi>
discovered, they sent into <hi>England</hi> one <hi>Shamiers,</hi>
(if it be not a counterfeit name) a lesuit, which
might draw the discontented Nobles vnto the
<hi>Spanish</hi> side, &amp; throw the <hi>Scots Queene</hi> headlong
into dangers and despayre, signifying to her, that
if she should be trouble some to hinder their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes,
that neither she nor her sonne should
raigne here. And stirred vp new troubles in
<hi>France</hi> to withdraw her cousens the <hi>Guises</hi> from
hindering their devises, by wrapping them in
new garboiles against the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and
the Prince of <hi>Condy.</hi> In which the King of <hi>Spaine</hi>
had a hand, to set <hi>France</hi> in troubles, that he in
the meane time might the better proceed in his
intentions for <hi>England.</hi> These desperate courses
drew the <hi>Scots Queene</hi> into more danger.</p>
            <p>At this time a most desperate and pernicious
conspiracy brake out, which as by the free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
of the conspirators appeareth, was thus.

or rather doting, an omnipotency in the <hi>Pope,</hi>
did labour to perswade themselues, that <hi>Pius</hi> V.
his bull against Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted by
the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> and that it was a thing meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to kill excommunicated Princes, yea, and
that it was martyrdome to loose their liues in
that quarrell. <hi>Giffard</hi> a Doctor of <hi>Theologie, Gilbert
Giffard,</hi> and <hi>Hodgeson,</hi> Priests, did so hammer
these devises into the corrupt head of <hi>Iohn Sauage</hi>
(who they say was a Bastard) that he being <hi>heady</hi>
and <hi>bloudy</hi> (a fit instrument for <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esuites</hi>) made a
vow to kill Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> At the same time
they set out a Book (for no other purpose, but
with great cunning to draw the <hi>Queene</hi> and
Councell into securitie, and to lay their vngraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
plots more deeply, and so with more ease
to come to that mischievous end they shot at).
In which Booke they admonish the <hi>Papists</hi> in
<hi>England,</hi> that they practise no hurt to the <hi>Queene,</hi>
for that they were onely to vse such weapons as
are lawfull for <hi>Christians</hi> to vse, that is, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

armour, daily prayers, watchings, fastings</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their adversaries, this was their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ox craft.
And withall they spred a false rumour by their
whisperers, that <hi>George Giffard</hi> one of the <hi>Queenes</hi>
Gentlemen <hi>Pencionaries</hi> had sworne to kill the
<hi>Queene,</hi> and for that cause had wiped the <hi>Guise</hi>
of a great summe of money.</p>
            <p>At Easter following, <hi>Iohn Ballard,</hi> a Priest of the
<hi>Remish seminary,</hi> who had assayed the mindes of
many Papists, to whom he travelled to conferre
with, through <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7927:56"/>
into <hi>England.</hi> This man had dealt with
<hi>Bernardin Mendoza,</hi> now the ordinary <hi>Spanish</hi>
Ambassadour in <hi>France,</hi> and with <hi>Charles Paget</hi>
for an invasion of <hi>England.</hi> Declaring that now
was the fittest opportunitie for that service,
whilst the military men were absent, being then
imployed in the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> A fitter time
could never be hoped, for as much as the <hi>Pope,</hi>
the <hi>Spanyard,</hi> the <hi>Guise,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> had
resolved to invade <hi>England,</hi> to turne the Warres
from the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> And albeit <hi>Paget</hi> had made
it evident, that as long as the <hi>Queene</hi> liued, the
invasion of <hi>England</hi> would be in vaine, yet was
<hi>Ballard</hi> sworne, and sent into <hi>England,</hi> to procure
all the helpe that might be to the conspiratours,
and the liberty of the <hi>Scots Queene.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At Pentecost following, that <hi>silken Priest</hi> came
into <hi>England,</hi> in a <hi>Souldiers habit,</hi> with a feigned
name, called Captaine <hi>Foscue.</hi> This man had
conference in <hi>London</hi> with <hi>Antony Babington,</hi> a
Gentleman of <hi>Darbyshire,</hi> yong, rich, wittie, and
learned aboue the expectation of his yeares, and
being addicted to the <hi>Romish Religion,</hi> had a little
before got into <hi>France</hi> without leaue. Where he
had familiar conversation with <hi>Thomas Morgan,</hi>
and with the Bishop of <hi>Glasco</hi> the <hi>Scots Queenes</hi>
Ambassadour. These men extolling the heroick
vertues of the <hi>Scots Queene,</hi> made to him great
ostentation of assured hopes of honor by her
meanes to be obtained. The ambitious yong
man was easily drawne to take hold of that faire
glistering estate proposed by them. And they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7927:57"/>
were as ready cunningly to set him forward;
and before he had well thought of the matter,
they commended him by Letters to the <hi>Scots
Queene.</hi> For when he was returned into <hi>England,</hi>
she saluted him favourably with her Letters;
from that time <hi>Morgan</hi> vsed his helpe in sending
Letters to her, vntill she was committed to the
custodie of <hi>Amice Paulet.</hi> For after that, the yong
man finding the danger, ceased. With this <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bington,
Ballard</hi> had conference of the things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid.
But he thought assuredly so long as
Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> liued, that the invasion of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
would come to nothing. But when <hi>Ballard</hi>
signified to him, that Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> would
not long be aliue; for <hi>Sauage</hi> who had vowed to
kill her, was now come into <hi>England; Babington</hi>
thought not good that so great a matter should
be committ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to <hi>Sauage</hi> onely, least he might be
stopped from the enterprise. But rather to sixe
valiant and resolute Gentlemen, in which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<hi>Sauage</hi> should be one, that he might not be
condemned for not performing his vow. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
<hi>Babington</hi> tooke a new course, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion,
touching the ports where the strangers
might land, and the forces that should be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with them, and the delivering the <hi>Scots
Queene,</hi> and the <hi>Tragick</hi> slaughter of Queene <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth,</hi>
as he called it.</p>
            <p>Whilst he was fixed in these cogitations, he
received Letters by an vnknowne boy; written
from the <hi>Queene of Scots,</hi> in that familiar cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
which was vsed betweene them. She bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7927:57"/>
him, but mildly, for his long silence; and
willed him to send her the Packet of Letters
sent from <hi>Morgan,</hi> and delivered by the <hi>French</hi>
Ambassadors Secretary. Which he did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
And by the same messenger sent to her
a Letter, wherein he excused his silence, for that
he wanted opportunitie of sending since that
she was in the custodie of <hi>Amice Paulet,</hi> a <hi>puritan,</hi>
a meere <hi>Leicestrian,</hi> and a most bitter enemy of
the <hi>Catholike</hi> faith. He declared what he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
with <hi>Ballard,</hi> that sixe Gentlemen were
chosen to performe the tragicke slaughter, and
that himselfe with an hundreth other, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
her. He intreated that to these <hi>Heroick
Actors</hi> (so he called them) rewards might be
proposed, or to their posteritie, if they should
faile in the action. The twentie-seventh of <hi>Iuly,</hi>
answer was made to these Letters. <hi>Babington</hi>
his forward desire of promoting the <hi>Catholike</hi>
Religion was commended. He was warned that
it might be vndertaken considerately, and that
nothing be moued before they were sure of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
forces: that an association among them
might be made, as if they feared the <hi>Puritanes:</hi>
that some trouble might be stirred in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
whilst the stroke might be given here at home:
that <hi>Arundell,</hi> and his brethren, and <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
should be drawne to the side, <hi>VVestmerland,
Paget,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> might be secretly called home.
The way to deliver her was also prescribed; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to overturne a Coach in the gate, or to set
the Stables on fire, or to intercept her whilst
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7927:58"/>
she rode to take the ayre betweene <hi>Chartley</hi> and
<hi>Stafford.</hi> Last of all <hi>Babington</hi> was warranted to
vndertake for rewards, and to pawne his credit
to the six Gentlemen, and others.</p>
            <p>Now had he gathered about him certaine
Gentlemen, inflamed with a fiery zeale of the
<hi>Romish Religion.</hi> Of whom the chiefe were,
<hi>Edward Windsore,</hi> brother to the Lord <hi>Windsore,</hi>
a yong Gentleman of a soft disposition, <hi>Thomas
Salisbury,</hi> of a Knights house in <hi>Denbigh</hi>-shire,
<hi>Charles Tilney,</hi> an ancient Gentleman, the onely
hope of the Familie, one of the <hi>Queenes Pencio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,</hi>
whom <hi>Ballard</hi> had reconciled to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church; both proper yong men: <hi>Chidioc
Tychburn,</hi> of <hi>Hampshire, Edward Abington,</hi> whose
father was the <hi>Queenes</hi> Cofferer: <hi>Robert Gage</hi> of
<hi>Surrey, Iohn Traverse,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Charnok</hi> of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chishire,
Iohn Iones,</hi> whose father was Queene
<hi>Maries</hi> taylour, <hi>Sauage, Barnwell,</hi> a Gentleman of
<hi>Ireland, Henry Dun,</hi> Clarke of the first fruit of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
Into this societie <hi>Polly</hi> also insinuated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
a man well acquainted with the affayres
of the <hi>Scots Queene:</hi> a man well skilled in the
art of simulation and dissimulation. Who was
thought daily to reveile all their councells to
Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham,</hi> and to thrust them head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
into mischiefe, who were forward enough
of themselues to evill. Albeit, <hi>Navus</hi> the <hi>Scots
Queenes</hi> Secretary warned them to beware of
him.</p>
            <p>To these did <hi>Babington</hi> communicate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but not all to each one: his owne Letters
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7927:58"/>
and the <hi>Scots Queenes</hi> Letters he shewed to <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard,</hi>
to <hi>Tychburn,</hi> and <hi>Dun.</hi> He dealt with <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
and <hi>Tychburn,</hi> to be the strikers. They at first
denied to dehle their hands with the bloud of
their Prince. <hi>Ballard</hi> and <hi>Babington</hi> labour to
proue it lawfull to kill Princes excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
and if <hi>right should be violated, then for the
Catholike Religion it is to be violated.</hi> Herevpon
hardly perswaded, they yeeld their consent in a
sort. <hi>Abington, Barnwell, Charnok,</hi> and <hi>Sauage</hi>
readily and roundly without scruple sware to
kill her. <hi>Salisbury</hi> could by no meanes be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to be a Queene-killer, but to deliver the
<hi>Scots Queene,</hi> he offred his service willingly.
<hi>Babington</hi> designeth <hi>Ty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hburn</hi> aboue the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
to helpe the percussors, of whose fidelitie
and courage he had perswaded himselfe much.
But he was now absent, travailing abroad. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bington</hi>
commandes that they impart the matter
to none, except first an oath be taken to keepe
silence. These conspiratours now and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
of these matters in Saint <hi>Giles</hi> fields, in
<hi>Pauls</hi>-Church, in Tavernes, in which they
had their daily feasts, being now puffed vp with
the hopes of great matters. Sometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
the valour of the Nobles of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
who lately had intercepted the King at <hi>Sterling:</hi>
and of <hi>Gerard</hi> the <hi>Burgonian,</hi> who killed the
Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> And so farre they procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in their foolish vanitie, so strangly infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated,
that those that should strike the <hi>Queene,</hi>
they had portraied in liuely pictures, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7927:59"/>
in the midst of them <hi>Babington,</hi> with this
Verse.
<q>Hi mihi sunt comites, quos ipsa pericula ducunt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But when this Verse was disliked, as seeming
too plaine: for it, they set in place these wordes:
<hi>Quorsum haec alió properantibus?</hi> These pictures
were taken, as it was said, and brought to the
<hi>Queene;</hi> who knew none of their countenances
but onely <hi>Barnwells,</hi> who vsed often to come in
her presence, following the causes of the Earle
of <hi>Kildare,</hi> whom he served: and she tooke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of him by other markes. Verily one day as
she was walking abroad she saw <hi>Barnwell,</hi> she
looked sharply and vndauntedly vpon the man,
and turning to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Christopher Hatton,</hi> Captaine of
the <hi>Guard,</hi> and to some others: <hi>Am not I,</hi> quoth
she, <hi>well guarded, who haue not so much as one man
in my company that hath a sword?</hi> For <hi>Barnwell</hi>
told this to the other conspiratours, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
how easily she might haue beene killed, if
the conspiratours had then beene present. <hi>Sauage</hi>
in like sort reported the same.</p>
            <p>Now there was nothing that so much troubled
<hi>Babington,</hi> as the feare least the promise of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
forces might faile. And therefore to make
that good, he resolved to goe into <hi>France,</hi> and to
send <hi>Ballard</hi> secretly before, for whose passage he
had procured licence for money vnder a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
name. And to remoue all suspition from
himselfe by <hi>Polly</hi> he in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inuateth himselfe into
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7927:59"/>
Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham,</hi> and dealeth earnestly
with him, to intreat of the <hi>Queene</hi> license for his
passage into <hi>France,</hi> promising to doe some espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
seruice, in searching and discovering the
secret attempts of the fugitiues for the <hi>Scots
Queene.</hi> He commended the purpose of the
yong man, and promised not onely to obtaine
him licence to travell, but he promised withall
great and goodly rewardes to him, if he would
doe such a service, yet holding him in suspence,
he delayed the matter, and knew his purpose
and drift well, having fished all out by an especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
skill he had in discovering treasons, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by the discovery of <hi>Gilbert Giffard,</hi> a Priest,
he was made acquainted with their intentions,
which they thought were kept so secret that the
Sunne had not knowne any thing thereof.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Giffard</hi> was borne at <hi>Chellington,</hi> where
the <hi>Scots Queene</hi> was kept, and sent by the fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues
into <hi>England,</hi> vnder the name of <hi>Luson,</hi> to
put <hi>Sauage</hi> in minde of his vow vndertaken, and
to lurke as a fit meanes to transmit Letters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<hi>them,</hi> and the <hi>Scots Queene,</hi> because in so
dangerous a businesse, they could not draw in
to serue their turne herein neither the Countesse
of <hi>Arundell,</hi> nor the Lord <hi>Lumley,</hi> nor <hi>Henry Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
nor S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>George Shirly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fugitiues, to try whether the way was
safe by <hi>Giffard</hi> to transmit Letters, first sent
blankes many times sealed like Letters and pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keted,
which when by the answers they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be truely delivered, now growne more
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7927:60"/>
confident, wrote often of their affaires intended,
in secret Characters. But <hi>Giffard</hi> before this,
whether <hi>vexed</hi> in his conscience, or <hi>corrupted</hi>
before with money, or <hi>terrified</hi> with feare, had
opened himselfe to Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham,</hi> and
declared with what purpose he was sent into
<hi>England,</hi> and offered all his service, as from the
loue to his Countrey and his Prince, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to communicate to him all the Letters
that he received either from the fugitiues, or
from the <hi>Scots Queene.</hi> Sir <hi>Francis</hi> imbracing the
opportunitie offerd, intertained him courteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and sent him into <hi>Staffordshire,</hi> and wrote to
Sir <hi>Amice Pawlet,</hi> willingly to suffer some of his
servants to be corrupted by <hi>Giffard,</hi> and to winke
at it. But he being vnwilling, as he said, to suffer
any of his houshold servants, by simulation to
become a traytor, yet though vnwillingly, he
suffred that the brewer, or the man that provided
Provender for his horse, who dwelt neare him,
might be corrupted by <hi>Giffard. Giffard</hi> easily
corrupted the brewer with some peeces of gold,
who by a hole in the wall, where a stone was set
which might be remoued, sent Letters secretly,
and received others, which alwayes by messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
provided for the purpose, came to the hands
of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Walsingham.</hi> Who opened the seales,
coppied out the Letters, and by the singular
cunning of <hi>Thomas Philipps</hi> found the secret
Character, and by the skill of <hi>Arthur Gregory</hi>
sealed them vp againe so cunningly, that no
man could suspect that they were opened, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7927:60"/>
then sent them to the parties to whom they were
directed. Thus were disclosed those former Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from the <hi>Scots Queene</hi> to <hi>Babington,</hi> and his
answers, and others againe from her to him,
(in which there was a Postscript cunningly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the same Character, to write the names of
the six Gentlemen, and happily some other
things.) Moreover, the same day, the Letters to
<hi>Mendoza</hi> the Spanish Ambassadour, to <hi>Charles
Paget,</hi> to the Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> to the Archbishop of
<hi>Glasco,</hi> and to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Inglefeld,</hi> were all coppi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out, and transmitted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Queene,</hi> as soone as she vnderstood so
rough a tempest hanging over her head, both
from inward traytors and forraine enemies, she
commanded to the end that the conspiracy
might the sooner be quelled, that <hi>Ballard</hi> should
be apprehended. Wherevpon he was suddenly
taken, in the very nick, when he was ready to
depart into <hi>France.</hi> Being taken in <hi>Babingtons</hi>
house. Herevpon <hi>Babington</hi> was afraid and sore
troubled, and vexed with a thousand cogitations
he came to <hi>Tychburn,</hi> and with him adviseth
what is best to doe. His advise was that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiratours
should presently disperse themselues
and fly, yet <hi>Babington</hi> thought it best to send <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage</hi>
and <hi>Charnok</hi> presently to kill the <hi>Queene.</hi>
But first to put <hi>Sauage</hi> in brauer and more court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apparell, that so he might haue a more easie
passage. And of this proiect he had the same day
speech with him, in <hi>Pauls</hi>-Church. But present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
changing his minde, and concealing his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7927:61"/>
cares and feares, he wrote Letters to Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Walsingham,</hi> being then in Court, wherein
with great earnestnes he intreated that now at
last he might haue license to depart into <hi>France;</hi>
and withall he made suit for <hi>Ballards</hi> deliverance,
who might be of great vse to him in his propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
busin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sse. Sir <hi>Francis</hi> with faire promises
keepes him from day to day in hope. That <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard</hi>
was taken, he layeth all the fault vpon <hi>Yong,</hi>
that cunning hunter of <hi>Papists,</hi> and vpon some
other <hi>Catch-poles;</hi> and warneth <hi>Babington</hi> to take
heed to such kinde of men, as friendly admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
him, and easily perswadeth the yong man,
that vntill the <hi>Queene</hi> might be at leasure to
signe the Bill for his passage, he would returne
to <hi>London,</hi> and lodge in <hi>his</hi> house at <hi>London,</hi> to
the end that they might conferre more secretly
of so great matters. And that by his often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
the fugitiues might not haue any suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when he came into <hi>France.</hi> In the meane
time, <hi>Skidmor,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham</hi> his servant
was commanded to obserue him most strictly,
and should be with him whither soever he went;
in shew that so he might be safer from messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
that otherwise might apprehend him.
Thus farre S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Francis Walsingham</hi> had closely car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
this businesse without the knowledge of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the privy Councell, and would haue
proceeded farther. But the <hi>Queene</hi> would not;
least (as she said) <hi>by not preventing the danger
when shee might, shee might seeme rather to tempt
God, then to trust in God.</hi> Wherevpon Sir <hi>Francis</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:7927:61"/>
from Court wrote to his man, that he should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
<hi>Babington</hi> with an especiall care. This Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was not sealed, but so delivered that as the
man read it, <hi>Babington</hi> sitting at Table with him
did also reade it. Wherevpon finding himselfe
guiltie, and suspecting that all was disclosed,
the next night when he, and <hi>Skidmor,</hi> and one or
two of Sir <hi>Francis</hi> his servants, had supped som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
freely in a Taverne, he rose as going to pay
the reckoning, and leaving his cloak and rapier,
fled away in the darke to <hi>Westminster.</hi> Where
<hi>Gage</hi> changed apparell with him, who presently
put off the same againe in <hi>Charnoks</hi> chamber, and
put on <hi>Charnoks.</hi> And conveyed themselues both
into S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Wood neare to the <hi>Cittie.</hi> Whither
<hi>Barnwell</hi> and <hi>Dun</hi> came to them. In the meane
time they were declared traytors throughout
<hi>England.</hi> They hiding themselues in Woods and
by-wayes after they had in vaine expected mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
from the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour, and horse
from <hi>Tychburn,</hi> they cut off <hi>Babingtons</hi> hayre, and
defaced his natiue beautie with rubbing his face
over with the greene huskes of Walnuts. And
being forced by hunger they came to <hi>Bellamyes</hi>
house, neare to <hi>Harrow</hi> on the Hill, who was a
great favourer of the <hi>Romish Religion.</hi> Where they
were hid in Barnes, and fed, and cloathed with
rusticall apparell. After ten dayes they were
found and brought to <hi>London.</hi> Herevpon the
Cittie witnessed their publike ioy by ringing of
bells, by bonefires in the streets, by singing of
Psalmes, in so much that the Citizens had great
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7927:62"/>
thankes given them from the QVEENE.</p>
            <p>The other conspiratours were soone caught,
many of them neare the Cittie; <hi>Salisbury</hi> in <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire,</hi>
his horse being killed vnder him by
them who followed him, and <hi>Trauerse</hi> was taken
with him, after they had swimmed over the river
<hi>Weuer.</hi> And <hi>Iones</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> who was not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the inuasion intended, but onely recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
them into his house, after he knew them to
be proclaimed rebells, and hid them. And had
furnished <hi>Salisbury</hi> as he fled, and his man (who
was a Priest) with a changed Cloake. Onely
<hi>Windsore</hi> was not found. Many dayes were spent
in examining of them, who by their confessions
betrayed one another, concealing nothing.</p>
            <p>All this time the <hi>Scots Queene</hi> and her servants
were kept by such a diligent watch of Sir <hi>Amice
Pawlet,</hi> that those things were altogether hid
from her, though now well knowne over all <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
But after that these were apprehended,
Sir <hi>Thomas Gorge</hi> was sent to acquaint her with
these things in few words. Which he did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
when she thought least of the matter, as she
was taking horse to ride a hunting. Neither was
she permitted to returne, but in shew of honor she
was carried about to Noble mens houses. In the
meane time, <hi>Iohn Maners, Edward Ashton, Richard
Bagot,</hi> and <hi>William Wade</hi> (who ignorant of the
whole matter had beene sent into these parts)
receiving authoritie from the <hi>Queene,</hi> did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<hi>Navus,</hi> and <hi>Curle,</hi> Secretaries, and other ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
to such as might keepe them asunder, that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7927:62"/>
they might not conferre together among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
nor with the <hi>Scets Queene.</hi> And breaking
vp the Chamber-doores, they tooke all Chesies
and Boxes, wherein they found Letters, and sent
them sealed with their seales to the Court. After
that Sir <hi>Amice Pawlet,</hi> being commanded, tooke
all the money, least she might corrupt some for
money, and gaue his promise to restore all again.
When the packets of Letters were opened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Queene,</hi> the Letters of many forrainers
were found, and Coppies of many Letters to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
and about sixtie Tables of secret Cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racters.
And some Letters from certaine Noble
men of <hi>England,</hi> with a full declaration of their
loue and services. Which thing notwithstanding,
Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> dissembled that matter in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and accordingly vsed that word: <hi>Video,
taceo; I see and say nothing.</hi> But they smelling
the matter, least they might seeme to favour the
<hi>Scots Queene,</hi> after that, began to show themselues
enemies against her.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Giffard,</hi> after he had played his part in
this play, was sent away as a banished man into
<hi>France;</hi> leaving before he went an indented pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
with the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour Leiger in <hi>England,</hi>
with this instruction, that he should deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Letters which he might receiue from the
<hi>Scots Queene,</hi> or from the fugitiues, to none other
but onely to him, who exhibited a paper an swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to that indented paper. Which paper was by
him sent secretly to Sir <hi>Francis Walsingham. Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fard</hi>
returning into <hi>France,</hi> after a few moneths
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7927:63"/>
was imprisoned for his filthy life: and suspected
of these things, died miserably; confessing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the foresaid matters, which was also found
in his papers.</p>
            <p>The XIII. of <hi>September,</hi> seven of the conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours
being brought to iudgement, confessed
themselues guiltie, and were condemned of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
Other seven came the next day, who denied
that they were guiltie; and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted themselues
to God and their Country: yet were they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by their former confessions. Onely <hi>Polly,</hi>
though guiltie of all, yet when he affirmed that
he disclosed some of those matters to Sir <hi>Francis
Walsingham,</hi> was not called to iudgement. The
twentieth of that month, the first seven were han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and quattered in S. <hi>Giles</hi> fields, where they
vsed to meet. <hi>Ballard,</hi> the contriver of all the
mischief, asked pardon of <hi>God,</hi> and of the <hi>Queene</hi>
conditionally, if he had sinned against her. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bington</hi>
(who without feare beheld <hi>Ballards</hi> death,
whilst the rest were vpon their knees in prayer)
freely confessed his sinnes, and after he was taken
downe from the Gallowes, cryed out in Latin,
<hi>Parce mihi Iesu:</hi> the rest in their order likewise
were hanged and quartered.</p>
            <p>After the punishment of these, <hi>Navus</hi> a <hi>French</hi>
man, and <hi>Curlus</hi> a <hi>Scot,</hi> Secretaries to the <hi>Scots
Queene</hi> were called into question vpon the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that were taken in the lodging of the <hi>Scots
Queene,</hi> and freely confessed that those Letters
were of their owne writing, dictated by her in
<hi>French,</hi> and so taken by <hi>Navus,</hi> turned into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:7927:63"/>
by <hi>Curle,</hi> and written in secret Characters,
whereby she was at last brought into question,
which brought her also to her end.</p>
            <p>The thing which we obserue vpon this Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is to continue our complaint of these grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
instruments the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Iesuites,</hi> that by
their wicked suggestions bring Princes, Nobles,
Gentlemen of good place, which might haue
done good service to their Prince and Country,
such I say doe these wicked instruments bring to
ruine; and seeme to take a pleasure in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of men. May we not see how they come
in secretly, and scraule in corners like Serpents?
It is true the <hi>enmity</hi> is of old set betweene the <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
seed</hi> and the <hi>Serpents seed:</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi>
which is the Womans seed haue felt the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
hereof at all times. But never had any
Church in the world a more liuely experience
hereof, then this <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> against whom
all this hath beene wrought. The <hi>Church</hi> is the
<hi>house of God,</hi> and this <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is here
with vs <hi>Gods house.</hi> It is apparant that this house
was built not vpon the <hi>sand,</hi> but vpon a <hi>rocke;</hi>
for the <hi>windes haue blowne</hi> fiercely vpon it, the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
haue risen</hi> against it, the <hi>great and huge tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests
haue beaten</hi> vpon it, and yet it standeth. And
for this we prayse Gods name, that it standeth
still. And for this purpose is this small Worke
vndertaken, to giue the watch-word to all them
that <hi>feare God,</hi> and <hi>loue</hi> the comming of our <hi>Lord,</hi>
to giue most <hi>humble</hi> and most <hi>hearty</hi> thankes vnto
God for this inestimable favour of God, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7927:64"/>
all these assaults which haue beene greater in
danger, mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e in number then any Nation in the
world at this day can number: that after all, I say,
our <hi>Church</hi> standeth and flourisheth: this is our
reioycing in God, in his goodnesse and mercy.
But now consider who oppugne vs? <hi>the serpents
seed;</hi> for can any man with any reason deny these
men to be the seed of the serpent? I meane the
<hi>seminary Priests</hi> &amp; <hi>lesuites.</hi> Are not these the seed
of the serpent? They plot, and practise treasons,
they raise rebellions, their heads and hands are
full of bloud and murther. And what can the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
his seed doe more? They are men acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the <hi>deepenes of Satan,</hi> they lay snares and
wicked plots for des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ructions of States, and least
men should descry their mischiefe, they set a
cleane contrary countenance vpon their actions,
giving out that their weapons are <hi>Preces &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrymae,
Prayers and teares,</hi> and that it is vnlawfull
for them to vse any other weapons; even then
when they are about their most bloudy designes:
and what can the serpents seed doe more? Can
the seed of the serpent proceed more maliciously,
more cruelly, more deeply in bloud then these
haue done? Then let them be knowne to be the
seed of the serpent. As for vs, we reioyce to be the
seed of the Woman, the true Church of God: we
suffer, we are reviled, standered, called <hi>Heretikes:</hi>
We learne of our Master to <hi>indure the crosse, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
the shame: We run with patience the race which
he hath set before vs.</hi> And we serue God not in
vaine; for we see that there is a reward for them
that serue Him.</p>

the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour Leiger in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
a man wholly devoted to the <hi>Guysian</hi> facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
went about to helpe the captived <hi>Queene,</hi> not
by faire meanes, but by treason. First he confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
secretly to kill the <hi>Queene,</hi> with <hi>William Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
a yong Gentleman, easie to be drawn to new
hopes: whose mother was of the <hi>Queenes</hi> bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber;
his brother was the <hi>English</hi> Leiger in
<hi>France</hi> at this time. Afterward he dealt more
plainly with him, touching this proiect, by his
secretary <hi>Trappius.</hi> Who promised to <hi>Stafford,</hi>
if he would vndertake that matter, not onely
great glory, great store of money, but especiall
grace and favour with the <hi>Pope,</hi> with the <hi>Guises,</hi>
and with all the <hi>Catholikes. Stafford</hi> his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
grudging at so great a wickednesse, refused
to vndertake it. Yet he commended one <hi>Moody,</hi>
a cut-throat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a man fit for such a businesse, that if
money were given him, would vndoubtedly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
and dispatch the businesse. To him
went <hi>Stafford,</hi> where he found him kept in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7927:65"/>
in <hi>London,</hi> and told him that the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
would gladly speake with him. He
answered that he was willing, so that he might
be freed out of prison. In the meane time, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated

secretaries might be sent to him: with
whom he had familiar acquaintance. The next
day <hi>Trappius</hi> was sent to him with <hi>Stafford.</hi> Who,
when <hi>Stafford</hi> was remoued, conferred with
<hi>Moody</hi> of the manner of killing the <hi>Queene.
Moody</hi> proposed a course to doe it by poison,
or by a sacke of twentie pound of Gun-powder
to be laid vnder the <hi>Queenes</hi> chamber, and to be
fired secretly. These courses pleased not <hi>Trappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
but he wished that a man of such courage
might be sound, as was that <hi>Burgonian</hi> who kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things were presently revealed to the
<hi>Queenes</hi> Councell by <hi>Stafford.</hi> Wherevpon <hi>Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi>
now purposing to goe into <hi>France,</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted,
and examined of these things. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the <hi>Ambassadour</hi> himselfe, the twelfth of
<hi>Ianuary</hi> was sent for vnto the house of Secretary
<hi>Cecill,</hi> and came in the evening; where were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by the <hi>Queenes</hi> command, <hi>Cecill,</hi> Lord
<hi>Burghley,</hi> Secretary, the Earle of <hi>Leicester,</hi> Sir
<hi>Christopher Hatton,</hi> and <hi>Dauison</hi> another secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
These signifie to the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadour,
that they sent for him, to let him know the cause
why they intercepted <hi>Trappius,</hi> his Secretary,
when he was ready to goe into <hi>France;</hi> and they
did open every thing which <hi>Stafford, Moody,</hi> and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7927:65"/>
               <hi>Trappius</hi> himselfe had confessed. And that they
might testifie the same in his presence, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to be called in. The Ambassadour
who bending his brows, heard these things with
much impatience; rising vp, said, that himselfe
being an Ambassadour would not heare any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations
to wrong his King, or in the preiudice
of Ambassadours. But when they answered, that
these men should not be produced as accusers,
but onely that he might be satisfied that these
things were not fained, nor false: then he rested.
As soone as <hi>Stafford</hi> was produced, and began to
speake, he presently interrupted him, and railing
vpon him, affirmed that <hi>Stafford</hi> first proposed
the matter to him, and that himselfe had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to send him bound hand and foot to the
<hi>Queene,</hi> if he would not desist from so wicked
an enterprise: yet that he spared him for the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
affection which he bare to the mother, the
brother, and sister of <hi>Stafford. Stafford</hi> falling
vpon his knees protested in many wordes vpon
his salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Ambassadour proposed
the matter first to him. But when the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
seemed to be extraordinarily moued, <hi>Stafford</hi>
was commanded to depart; and <hi>Moody</hi> was not
produced.</p>
            <p>Herevpon when <hi>Burghly</hi> had mildly charged
the Ambassadour to be guiltie of such a concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
wickednes, both from his owne words, and
out of the confession of <hi>Trappius:</hi> he answered,
that if he had beene conscious, yet being an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour,
he ought not to disclose it, but to his
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7927:66"/>
owne King. But <hi>Burghl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y</hi> interposing told him,
that if that were not the <hi>office of an Ambassadour</hi>
(which thing is yet in question) to disclose such
a mischievous practise which bringeth the life
of a Prince in danger: yet was it the <hi>office of a
Christian,</hi> to represse such notorious iniuries, not
onely for the safety of a Prince, but for the safety
of any Christian. But the other stoutly denyed
that; and withall said, that not long since, the
<hi>French</hi> Ambassadour being in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and having
notice of a conspiracy to take away the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Kings life, yet disclosed it not to the <hi>Spanish</hi> king,
but to his owne King, and was therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
of the King and of his Councellers.
The Lord <hi>Burghley</hi> gaue him a graue admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to take heed that hereafter he offended not
in such a point of treason against the Prince, and
not to forget the office of an Ambassadour, nor
the Prince her clemency, who would not wrong
good Ambassadours by the punishment of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
one, and though he were not <hi>punished,</hi> yet was
he not <hi>iustified,</hi> but did carry with him the <hi>guilt,</hi>
though not the <hi>punishment</hi> of such an offence.</p>
            <p>Though this intended evill came to no effect,
as all the other bloudy practises haue bin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
effect: yet may we make good vse of it to
blesse Gods name for all his great and manifold
deliverances. That it was disappointed, it was his
goodnes: for against those Kings that had not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
their service to God for the maintenance of
true Religion, great and bloudy practises haue
bin committed by lesse and more contemptible
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7927:66"/>
meanes. And as we haue iust cause to blesse God
for all his deliverances, so the adversaries of our
peace, haue iust cause to feare, to examine their
owne doings, and seriously to consider, whether
they haue not all this while striven against God,
in striving so long against those whom God doth
so miraculously defend</p>
            <p>Not long after this followed the ignominious
prodition of <hi>William Stanly,</hi> and <hi>Rowland York.</hi>
This <hi>York</hi> was a <hi>Londoner,</hi> a man of loose conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
and actions, and desperate. He was famous
among the <hi>Cutters</hi> of his time, for bringing in a
new kind of fight, to run the point of a rapier in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a mans body; this manner of fight he brought
first into <hi>England,</hi> with great admiration of his
<hi>audaciousnes.</hi> When in <hi>England</hi> before that time
the vse was with little buckl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs, and with broad
swords to strike, and not to thrust, and it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<hi>vnmanly</hi> to strike <hi>vnder the girdle.</hi> This
man provoked as he tooke it by some iniury of
the Earle of <hi>Leicester,</hi> fled to the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> and
for some time after served among the <hi>Spanyards.</hi>
Afterward being reconciled, was made Captaine
of a Sconce neare to <hi>Zutphen.</hi> After all this he was
so set vpon revenge, that being corrupted with
money, he did not onely betray the place to the
enemy; but drew also <hi>Stanly</hi> with him, being a
man that had served with great fidelitie and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
in the <hi>Irish</hi> warres. <hi>Stanly</hi> was not easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to be false, but this desperate fellow never
ceased to draw him into the fellowship of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
with him, by many asseverations and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7927:67"/>
oaths often repeated; telling him that it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
knowne in <hi>England,</hi> that he was of <hi>Babing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
conspiracy; that he was already discovered
by their confessions, &amp; that out of hand he should
be sent for to the gallowes. Thus he perswaded
<hi>Stanly</hi> to betray the rich and well fenced Towne
of <hi>Deventer</hi> to the <hi>Spanyards,</hi> against his oath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to <hi>Leicester</hi> and to the <hi>States.</hi> And seeking
some pretence of honesty against a fact so disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and disloyall, he seemed to please himselfe
in this, that he had restored a place to the <hi>true
Lord,</hi> which was held from him by <hi>rebells.</hi> And
being extreame <hi>Popish,</hi> he sent for <hi>Priests</hi> to his
company, which consisted of 1300 <hi>English</hi> and
<hi>Irish,</hi> to instruct them in the <hi>Popish Religion;</hi> boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
that this should be the <hi>seminary legion,</hi> which
should defend the <hi>Roman Religion</hi> with <hi>Armes,</hi> as
the <hi>seminary Priests</hi> defend it with <hi>writings.</hi> To
this purpose <hi>Alan,</hi> who a little after was <hi>Cardinall,</hi>
sent Priests presently to him, and wrote a Booke
also, wherein he commended this proditorious
act, from the authoritie of the Bull of <hi>Pius V</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Queene Elizabeth,</hi> and stirred vp others to
such perfidiousnes, as if they were not bound to
serue and obey a <hi>Queene</hi> excommunicated. But
looke I pray to the end.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spanyards</hi> set <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Stanly</hi> together in
contention one against the other; and soone after
they poyson <hi>York,</hi> and take his goods: his body
after three yeares was digged vp by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of the <hi>States,</hi> and hanged till it rotted.
They drew <hi>Stanly</hi> and his companies out of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter,</hi>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:7927:67"/>

               </gap>umelies, that some of them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

himselfe went into <hi>Spaine</hi> in hope of reward, and

            <p>The rumors of warre daily increased, at last it
was certainly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by the newes on all sides,
that in <hi>Spaine</hi> there was an <hi>invincible navy</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
against <hi>England;</hi> that the most famous Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7927:68"/>
in military knowledge, and the best soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
were sent for into <hi>Spaine,</hi> from <hi>Italy, Scicily,</hi>
yea from <hi>America.</hi> For the <hi>Pope,</hi> and some religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Spanyards,</hi> and <hi>English</hi> fugitiues, now recalled
the <hi>Spanyard</hi> to the cogitation of surprising of
<hi>England,</hi> which purpose was interrupted by the
<hi>Portugall</hi> warres. They exhorted him earnestly to
doe God this service, that had done so much for
him: now that he inioyed <hi>Portugall,</hi> with the <hi>west
Indies,</hi> &amp; many rich <hi>Ilands:</hi> to adde <hi>England</hi> to all,
were an especiall service of God, fit for his <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Maiestie.</hi> By this meanes he might adde these
flourishing Kingdomes to his <hi>Empire,</hi> &amp; so keepe
the <hi>Low-countries</hi> in peace, secure the navigatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to both <hi>Indies.</hi> That the preparations of <hi>Spaine</hi>
were so great that no power was able to resist it.
They made him belieue that it was an easier mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to overcome <hi>England,</hi> then to overcome the
<hi>Dutch-land,</hi> because the navigation from <hi>Spain</hi> to
<hi>England</hi> was much shorter, then to the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</hi>
And by surprising of <hi>England,</hi> the other
would easily follow.</p>
            <p>Herevpon the consultation began to be had,
of the best way and meanes to oppresse <hi>England.

                  </gap>anus,</hi> the Marquess of S. <hi>Crosse,</hi> who
was chiefe commander in the Navy, advised first
to make sure some part of <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>Zealand,</hi> by
the land-forces of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
before some <hi>Spanish</hi> shippes, so to take some
place on a suddain, where the <hi>Spanish</hi> navy might
haue a receptacle, and from whence the invasion
might with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>venience begin. For in the <hi>English</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:7927:68"/>
Sea, which is troublesome, the windes oft chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
the tydes vnknown, the Navy could not be
in safety. With him agreed <hi>Parma,</hi> who much vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
this expedition. Yet others disliked this
counsell, as a matter of great difficultie and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
of long time, of much labor, of great expence,
of vncertaine successe. And that neither secretly
nor openly it could be performed, and easily hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by the <hi>English.</hi> These thought that with
the same labour and expenses <hi>England</hi> might be
wonne: and the victory would be sure, if a well
prepared army from <hi>Spaine,</hi> might with a strong
navy be landed on <hi>Thames</hi> side, and of a suddain
surprise <hi>London</hi> the chiefe Citty by an vnexspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
assault. This seemed a thing most easie to be
effected. And therefore all agreed vpon it. Yet
some among them thought good that a denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
of the warre should be made by an <hi>Herald,</hi>
which they held a politik devise, both to remoue
suspition out of the minds of neighbour Princes,
and to force the <hi>Queene</hi> as they supposed, to call
to her helpe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orrain mercenary souldiers, concel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
that according to the vsuall insolency of
mercenaries, they would tumult and spoyle the
country; and so might the <hi>Queene</hi> be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hatred of her owne people: that so all things
in <hi>England</hi> would be brought into a confusion,
which might be helped by the <hi>English Catholikes.</hi>
But neither could this advise be heard. For they
being confident of their owne strength, thought
it was sufficient to commend the <hi>invincible Navy</hi>
to the prayers of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and of their other <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes,</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:7927:69"/>
and to the intercession of <hi>Saints:</hi> and to set
out a Booke in Print, to the terror of the <hi>English,</hi>
in which Booke, all the preparation was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
related. Which was so great through <hi>Spain,
Italy,</hi> and <hi>Scicily,</hi> that the <hi>Spanyards</hi> themselues
were in admiration of their owne forces, and
therefore named it the <hi>Invincible Fleet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> also in <hi>Flanders,</hi> by the
commandement of the <hi>Spanyard,</hi> built ships, and
a great company of small broad vessels, each one
able to transport thirty horse, with bridges fitted
for them severally. And hired Mariners from the
east part of <hi>Germany.</hi> And provided long peeces
of wood, sharpned at the end, and covered with i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,

vessels, with an huge number of fagots; and
placed an Army ready in <hi>Flanders,</hi> of 103 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of foot, and 4000 horsemen. Among these
were 700 <hi>English</hi> fugitiues, which were had of all

to defend these places: that they should by
their best means and power hinder the enemy to
take land; if he should take land, then should they
wast the country all about, and spoile every thing
that might be of any vse to the enemy, that so he
might find no more vittals then what he brought
vpon his shoulders with him. And that by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall

as the <hi>Papists</hi> within; for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> durst make
no attempt vpon <hi>England,</hi> but vpon confidence
of their helpe within. And therefore for the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of the whole, their heads were vpon some
pretenses to be cut off. Producing for this thing,
the example of <hi>Henry</hi> 8. For when the <hi>Emperour</hi>
&amp; <hi>French</hi> King at the <hi>Popes</hi> instigation, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined
and ready to invade <hi>England,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi>
presently executed the Marquess of <hi>Exceter,</hi> the
Lord <hi>Montacute, Edward Neuil,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> whom
he suspected to favour the enemies, which thing
as soone as he had done, the intended invasion
was stopped, and proceeded no further. But this
advise the <hi>Queene</hi> vtterly disliked, as being cruell,
she thought it enough to commit some of the
<hi>Papists</hi> to <hi>Wisbich Castle</hi> in cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tody; and casting
her eyes and mind on every side, she stirred vp her
Nobles with Letters often, though they were
carefull &amp; watchfull of themselues. She certified
<hi>Fitz Williams,</hi> Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> what she
would haue done there. She sent to the King of
<hi>Scots</hi> to warne him to take good heed of <hi>Papists,</hi>
and the <hi>Spanish</hi> faction. But he knowing well
what a tempest and desolation was hanging, and
threatning both alike, having already set his
heart vpon the maintenance of true religion, and
resolving to take part with the truth in prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and adversitie, which is onely able to saue and

of the <hi>Spanyards:</hi> and himselfe comming
to <hi>Anandale</hi> with an army, besieged <hi>Maxwell</hi> and
tooke him, and committed him to prison, who
was lately returned out of <hi>Spaine</hi> against his faith
and alleagance, and came with an intent to favor
the <hi>Spanish</hi> side; he declared the <hi>Spanyards</hi> should
be held as <hi>enemies,</hi> and against them caused all
with great alacritie to be ready in Armes.</p>
            <p>Among these <hi>preparations for warre,</hi> which were
great on both sides, <hi>the councels of peace</hi> were not
vtterly cast away.</p>
            <p>Two yeares before, the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
how hard a matter it was to end the <hi>Belgick</hi>
warre, so long as it was continually nourished and
supported with ayd from the <hi>Queene,</hi> he moued
for a treaty of peace, by the meanes of Sir <hi>Iames
Croft</hi> one of the privy councell, a man desirous of
peace, &amp; <hi>Andrew Loe</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi> man, and professed
that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had delegated authority to him
for this purpose. But the <hi>Queen</hi> fearing that there
was some cunning in this seeking of peace, that
the friendship betweene her and the confederate
Provinces might be dissolved, and that so they
might secretly be drawne to the <hi>Spanyard;</hi> she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
that treaty for some time. But now, that the
Warres on both sides prepared, might be turned
away, she was content to treat of <hi>Peace,</hi> but so as
still holding the <hi>weapons</hi> in her hand.</p>
            <p>For this purpose in <hi>February</hi> delegates were sent
into <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Derby,</hi> the Lo: <hi>Cobham,</hi>

               <hi>Dale</hi> to him, that a place
might be appointed for the treating, &amp; that they
might see the authoritie to him delegated from

to <hi>Ostend,</hi> not in <hi>Ostend</hi> which then was holden
of <hi>English</hi> against the King: his authority delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
he promised then to shew when they were

seeme to signifie. He affirmed that he did not so
much as thinke of the invasion of <hi>England,</hi> when
he wished that the businesse might proceed with
speed. And was in a maner offended with <hi>Richar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus,</hi>

moued that first a truce might be made. Which
they denied, alledging that that thing must needs
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7927:72"/>
be hurtfull to the <hi>Spanyard,</hi> who had for six

not admitted. Neither was it in the <hi>Queenes</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to vndertake a truce for <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi>
who daily attempted hostility. The <hi>English</hi> moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
instantly that the truce might be generall, for
all the <hi>Queenes</hi> territories, and for the Kingdome
of <hi>Scotland:</hi> but they would haue it but for foure

that is, <hi>Ostend, Flushing, Bergen vp zom,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Briel;</hi>
and these onely during the treating, and twenty

proposed some Articles. For which afterward by
<hi>Leicesters</hi> motion, he was imprisoned: albeit those
articles proposed by him were in the iudgement
of the other commissioners not to be disallowed.
But <hi>Delegates</hi> haue their <hi>limits</hi> circumscribed,
which they are not to passe. At last, when the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
could not obtain an abstinence from armes,
&amp; could by no meanes see the Charter by which
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7927:72"/>
the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> had this authority granted to
treat of peace: they proposed these things; that
the ancient leagues betweene the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy</hi> might be renued
and confirmed; that all the <hi>Dutch</hi> might fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
their own priviledges; that with freedome of
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science they might serue God; that the <hi>Spanish</hi>
and forrain souldiers might be put out of <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
that neither the <hi>Dutch,</hi> nor their neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Nations might feare them. If these things
might be granted, the <hi>Queene</hi> would come to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
conditions concerning the Townes which
now she held, (that all might know that she tooke
vp armes not for her own gain, but for the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
defence both of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and of <hi>her selfe)</hi> so
that the money which is owing therefore be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payed.
They answered: that for renuing the old
leagues there should be no difficulty, when they
might haue a friendly conference of that thing.
That concerning the priviledges of the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
there was no cause why forrain Princes should
take care, which priviledges were most favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
granted, not onely to Provinces and Townes
reconciled, but even to such as by force of armes
are brought into subiection. That forrain souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were held vpon vrgent necessity, when as <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,

those Townes taken from the King of

that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> might demand so many

him, as the <hi>Belgick</hi> warre hath cost him, since the

            <p>At this time D. <hi>Dale</hi> by the <hi>Queenes</hi> command
going to the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> did gently expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
with him touching a Booke Printed there,
set out lately by <hi>Cardinall Allen,</hi> wherin he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the Nobles, and people of <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Ireland</hi>
to ioyne themselues to the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> forces
vnder the conduct of the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> for the
execution of the sentence of <hi>Sixtus V</hi> Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Queene,</hi> declared by his bull. In which
she is declared an <hi>heretick, illegitimate, cruel</hi> against
<hi>Mary</hi> the <hi>Scots Queene,</hi> &amp; her subiects were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to helpe <hi>Parma</hi> against her: (for at that
time a great number of those <hi>bulls</hi> &amp; <hi>bookes</hi> were
printed at <hi>Antwerp</hi> to be dispersed through <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
The <hi>Duke</hi> denied that he had seene such a
<hi>bull</hi> or <hi>booke,</hi> neither would he doe any thing by
the <hi>Popes</hi> authoritie, as for his owne <hi>King,</hi> him he
must obey. Yet he said that he so observed the
<hi>Queene</hi> for her Princely vertues, that after the
King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> he offred all service to her. That
he had perswaded the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> to yeeld to
this treaty of peace, which is more profitable for
<hi>English,</hi> then <hi>Spanish.</hi> For if <hi>they</hi> should be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
they would easily repaire their losse: But if
<hi>you</hi> be overcome, the kingdome is lost. To whom
<hi>Dale</hi> replied: that our <hi>Queene</hi> was sufficiently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with forces to defend the Kingdom. That
a Kingdome will not easily be gotten by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of one battell, seeing the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> in so
long a warre, is not yet able to recover his anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7927:73"/>
patrimony in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> Well, quoth the
<hi>Duke,</hi> be it so. These things are in Gods hands.</p>
            <p>After this the Delegates contended among
themselues by mutuall replications, <hi>weauing</hi> and
<hi>vnweauing</hi> the same <hi>webb.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> were ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
in this, a toleration of Religion might be
granted at least for two yeares to the confederate
Provinces. They answered, that as the King of
<hi>Spaine</hi> had not intreated that for <hi>English Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks:</hi>
so they hoped that the <hi>Queene</hi> in her wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
would not intreat any thing of the King
of <hi>Spaine</hi> which might stand against his honor,
his oath, &amp; his conscience. When they deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the money due from the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Brabant,</hi> it
was answered, that the money was lent without
the Kings authoritie or privitie. But let the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
be taken, how much that money was, and
how much the King hath spent in these Warres,
and then it may appeare, who should looke for
repayment. By such answers they driue off the
<hi>English</hi> of purpose, vntill the <hi>Spanish fleet</hi> was
come neare the <hi>English shore,</hi> &amp; the noise of guns
were heard from sea. Then had they leaue to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
&amp; were by the <hi>Delegates</hi> honorably brought
to the borders neare to <hi>Calis.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>
had in the meane time brought all his forces to
the sea shore: Thus this conference came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
vndertaken by the <hi>Queene,</hi> as the wiser
then thought to avert the <hi>Spanish fleet;</hi> continued
by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that he might oppress the <hi>Queen,</hi>
being as he supposed vnprovided, and not expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the danger. So both of them tried to sow the
<hi>Fox-skin</hi> to the <hi>Lyons.</hi>

that he might send back foure of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7927:74"/>
But he did not easily giue credit to that report,
but with a gentle answer intreated him to beleiue
nothing hastily in so important a matter, that he
might keep those ships with him, though it were
vpon his owne charges. And finding a favourable
winde turned sailes toward <hi>Spaine,</hi> to surprise the
enemies shaken shippes in their harbours. When
he was not farre from the shore of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the
winde turned, &amp; he being charged to defend the

returned to <hi>Plimmouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With the same winde the 12 of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the Duke
of <hi>Medina</hi> with his fleet departed from the <hi>Groin.</hi>
And after one day or two, he sent <hi>Rhodericus Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>

giving him notice that the fleet was approching,

his land forces vpon <hi>Thames</hi> side. Now as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lator
of this story hath taken paines to declare
what was done each day, I will follow him
herein.</p>
            <p>The 16 <hi>day</hi> there was a great calme, and a thick
cloud was vpon the sea till noon: then the North
winde blowing roughly, &amp; again the Westwinde
till midnight, and after that the East: the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Navy was scattered, and hardly gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vntill they came within the sight of <hi>England</hi>
the 19 day of <hi>Iuly.</hi> Vpon which day the Lord
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7927:75"/>
Admirall was certified by <hi>Flemming</hi> (who had
beene a Pyrat) that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet was entred
into the <hi>English</hi> sea, which the Mariners call the
<hi>Channell.</hi> And was descried neare to the <hi>Lizard.</hi>
The Lord Admirall brought forth the <hi>English</hi>
Fleet into the Sea, but not without great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
by the skill, labour, and alacritie of the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
and mariners, every one labouring; yea the
<hi>Lord Admirall</hi> himselfe had his hand at the
worke.</p>
            <p>The next day the <hi>English</hi> fleet viewed the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
fleet comming along with Towers like Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
in height, her front <hi>crooked</hi> like the fashion
of the <hi>Moone,</hi> the <hi>hornes</hi> of the front were exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
one from the other about seaven miles asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
sailing with the labour of the windes, the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean</hi>
as it were groaning vnder it; their saile was
but slow, and yet at full saile before the winde.
The <hi>English</hi> gaue them leaue to hold on their
course, and when they were passed by, came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
them and got the helpe of the winde.</p>
            <p>The 21. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> the Lord <hi>Admirall</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
sent a Pinnace before, called the <hi>Defiance,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the Battell by shooting off some peeces.
And being himselfe in the <hi>Arch-royall,</hi> (the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
Praetorian Shippe or Admirall, he set vpon
a shippe which he tooke to be the <hi>Spanish Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi>
but it was the shippe of <hi>Alfonsus Leua.</hi> Vpon
that he bestowed much shot. Presently <hi>Drake,
Hawkins, Forbisher,</hi> came in vpon the <hi>Spanish</hi>
hindmost shippes which <hi>Recaldus</hi> governed. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these they thundred. <hi>Recaldus</hi> laboured what
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7927:75"/>
he could to stay his men, who fled to their navy,
vntill his shippe beaten and pearced with many
shot, did hardly recover the Fleet. At which time
the Duke <hi>Medina</hi> gathered together his dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Fleet, and setting vp more saile, they held
their course. Indeede they could doe no other,
for the <hi>English</hi> had gotten the advantage of
winde, and their shippes were much more nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and ready with incredible celeritie to come
vpon the enemie with a full course, and then to
turne, and returne, and be on every side at their
pleasure. When they had fought two houres,
and taken some triall of their owne courage
and of the <hi>Spanyards:</hi> The Lord <hi>Admirall</hi> thought
good not to continue the fight any longer then,
seeing that fortie ships were absent which were
scarce drawne out of <hi>Plimmouth</hi> haven. The
night following S. <hi>Catharin</hi> a <hi>Spanish</hi> shippe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sore torne with the fight, was received into
the midst of the Navie to be mended. Here a
great <hi>Cantabrian</hi> shippe of <hi>Oquenda,</hi> wherein was
the treasurer of the Campe, by force of Gunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder
that had taken fire, was set on fire; yet
was the fire quenched in time by the Shippes
that came to helpe her. Of these that came to
helpe the fired shippe, one was a <hi>Galeon,</hi> in which
was <hi>Petrus Waldez;</hi> the foremast of the <hi>Galeon</hi> was
caught in the tackling of another shippe, and
broken. This was taken by <hi>Drake,</hi> who sent <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez</hi>
to <hi>Dertmouth,</hi> the money <hi>fiftie-fiue thousand
D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cats,</hi> he distributed among his souldiers. That
night he was appointed to set forth light, but
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7927:76"/>
neglected it, and some <hi>German</hi> Merchants ships
comming by that night, he thinking them to be
enemies, followed them so farre, that the <hi>English</hi>
navy rested all night when they could see no light
set forth. Neither did he nor the rest of the navy
finde the <hi>Admirall</hi> vntill the next day at even.
The <hi>Admirall</hi> all the night preceding with the
<hi>Beare,</hi> and <hi>Mary Rose</hi> did follow the <hi>Spanyardes</hi>
with watchfulnesse. The <hi>Duke</hi> was busied in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
his Navy. <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lfonsus Leua</hi> was commanded
to ioyne the first and last companies, Every Ship
had his station assigned according to that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
forme which was appointed in <hi>Spaine,</hi>
it was present death to forsake his station. This
done he sent <hi>Gliclius</hi> an <hi>Anceant</hi> to <hi>Parma,</hi> which
might declare to him in what case they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re, and
left that <hi>Cantabrian</hi> ship of <hi>Oquenda</hi> to the winde
and sea, having taken out the money and mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and put them in other shippes. Yet it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that he had not care of all: for that shippe
the same day with fifty mariners and souldiers
lamed, and hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e burnt, fell into the hands of the
<hi>English,</hi> and was carried to <hi>Weimuth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 23. of the same moneth, the <hi>Spanyards</hi>
having a favourable North winde turned sailes
vpon the <hi>English;</hi> the <hi>English</hi> being much readier
in the vse of their ships, fett about a compasse for
the winde, and having gotten advantage of the
winde, they came to the fight on both sides.
They fought a while confusedly with variable
fortune: whilst on the one side the <hi>English</hi> with
great courage delivered the <hi>London</hi> ships which
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7927:76"/>
were inclosed about by the <hi>Spanyards;</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side the <hi>Spanyards</hi> by valour freed <hi>Recaldus</hi>
from the extreame danger he was in: there was
not greater effulminations by beating of ordnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
at any time, then was this day. Yet the losse
fell vpon the <hi>Spanish</hi> side, because their shippes
were so high that the shot went over the <hi>English</hi>
shippes, but the <hi>English</hi> having a faire marke at
their great shippes, shot never in vaine. Onely
<hi>Cock</hi> and <hi>English</hi> man b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing caught in the midst of
the <hi>Spanish</hi> shippes, could not be recovered, he
perished but with great honor revenged himself.
Thus a long time the <hi>English</hi> shippes with great
agilitie, were somtimes vpon the <hi>Spanyardes</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them the one side, and then the other, and
presently were off againe, and tooke the sea to
make themselues ready to come in againe.
Whereas the <hi>Spanish</hi> heavie shippes were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and hindred, and stood to be markes for
the <hi>English</hi> bullets. For all that, the <hi>Admirall</hi>
would not admit the <hi>English</hi> to come to grapple
and to boord their shippes, because they had a
full armie in their shippes, which he had not;
their shippes were many in number, and greater,
and higher, that if they had come to grapple, as
some would haue had it, the <hi>English</hi> that were
much lower then the <hi>Spanish</hi> shippes must needes
haue had the worse of them that fought from
the higher shippes. And if the <hi>English</hi> had beene
overcome, the losse would haue beene greater
then the victory could haue beene; for ours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overcome, would haue put the kingdome in
hazard.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:7927:77"/>The 24 day, they rested from fight on both
sides. The <hi>Admirall</hi> sent some small Barkes to the
next <hi>English</hi> shore, to supply the provision. And
deuided all his Navy into foure squadrons. The
first was vnder <hi>his owne</hi> government; the second
<hi>Drake</hi> governed; the third, <hi>Hawkins;</hi> the fourth,
<hi>Forbisher.</hi> And he appointed out of every squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
certaine little shippes, which on divers sides
might set vpon the <hi>Spanyards</hi> in the night, but a
suddain calme tooke them, and so that advise
was without effect.</p>
            <p>The 25 day, being S. <hi>Iames</hi> day, S. <hi>Anne</hi> the
<hi>Galeon</hi> of <hi>Portugall,</hi> not being able to hold course
with the rest, was set vpon by some small <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
shippes. For whose ayd came in <hi>Leua,</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacus
Telles Enriques</hi> with three <hi>Galeasses.:</hi> which
the <hi>Admirall</hi> and the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> espy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
made in against the <hi>Galeasses</hi> (the calme was
so great, that they were drawne in by boates
with cordes) and did so beat vpon the <hi>Galeasses</hi>
with great shot, that with much adoe, and not
without great losse, they hardly recouered the
<hi>Galeon.</hi> The <hi>Spanyardes</hi> reported that the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi>
of <hi>Spaine</hi> was that day in the hindmost com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and being nearer the <hi>English</hi> shippes then

did set vpon the <hi>English Admirall,</hi> who by the
benefit of the winde turning, escaped. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyardes</hi>
hold on their course againe, and send to
the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> that with all speed he should

ioyne his shippes with the Kings Fleet. These
things the <hi>English</hi> knew not, who write that they

helpe her. Thus it is in battell, they who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

            <p>The next day the Lord <hi>Admirall</hi> knighted the

out of the shallowes, and then began to consult
what were best for them to do. By common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
they resolved to returne into <hi>Spaine</hi> by the
<hi>Northern</hi> seas, for they wanted many necessaries,
especially shot, their ships were torne, &amp; they had

vpon the <hi>English,</hi> insomuch that it was thought by

when he heard them glorying, that what
way soever they came vpon <hi>England,</hi> they would
haue an vndoubted victory; that the <hi>English</hi> were
not able to indure the sight of them. <hi>Bernardinus

The King of <hi>Spaine</hi> may once enter into the

hee and his predecessours haue beene so many
times beguiled by the <hi>Pope,</hi> how often hath the
<hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Iesuites</hi> consecrated his banners,
promised him victory against vs, as against He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes

and not the <hi>Pope.</hi> If they would haue their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
to prosper, they must follow the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of our godly Princes, who are blessed for
the sincerity of Religion which they imbrace.
They must giue ouer iniustice and cruelty, for
the cruelty of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> haue lost them all
that they lost in the <hi>Netherlands:</hi> Their <hi>pride</hi>
and <hi>cruelty</hi> was highly raised against vs, but to
their owne hurt and dishonour, not to ours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we trust in God. They would haue extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
the true lights of <hi>Britain,</hi> (which then

There is no hope to make these <hi>Iesuites</hi> that
haue giuen themselues ouer to the seruice of <hi>the

such I say there is no hope to perswade them,
because <hi>they loue not the truth.</hi> But the <hi>Kings</hi>
and <hi>Princes</hi> that haue beene so long abused and

may ioyne with our religious Kings, against the

vnderstand his deceits and illusions, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
him: for otherwise they must perish with
him. They that are wise will vnderstand and
consider the cause which God hath so long, so
strongly maintained, they will consider the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
the fury, and rage of our aduersaries haue
beene continually frustrated by Gods power,
they may consider that these extraordinary
blessings vpon Gods Church among vs, and
the memorable iudgements of the aduersaries,
are but forerunners of some greater stroakes,
and heauier iudgements of God against them, if
they will not turne, and forsake superstitious
vanities, and serue God with vs. Which God

sharpely to the Lord <hi>Lieuetenant;</hi> which moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him so much, as leauing his charge to bee
managed by others, he came into <hi>England,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
to pacifie the <hi>Queene.</hi> When he came, he
was commanded to keepe his Chamber, and
soone after was committed to the custody of
the Lord <hi>Keeper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No sooner was the Lord Generall departed
from <hi>Ireland,</hi> but that <hi>Tyrone</hi> (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the cessation from warre, drawing his
Forces together, tooke the field; to whom Sir
<hi>William Warren</hi> was sent, to charge him with
breach of promise; he answered, that his doings
were according to couenants, hauing giuen
warning before: his cause was iust, for that the
Lord <hi>Lieuctenant</hi> was committed in <hi>England,</hi>
vpon whose honor he reposed his whole estate,
neither would hee haue any thing to doe with
the Councellors of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Hereupon presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
vpon <hi>Spaine,</hi> hee sent <hi>Odonel</hi> into <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught,</hi>
receiued tumultuous persons, strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the weake, glorying euery where that hee
would restore againe the ancient Religion and
liberty of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and expell the <hi>English</hi> out of
<hi>Ireland.</hi> To which end, some money and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
was sent from <hi>Spaine,</hi> and Indulgences
from <hi>Rome.</hi> And for an especiall fauour the
<hi>Pope</hi> sent him a plume of <hi>Phoenix</hi> feathers,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:7927:89"/>
for a Trophy of his victories.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tyrone</hi> vnder pretence of deuotion, in mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winter
went to the Monastery of <hi>Tipperary,</hi> to
worship the Crosse: from thence hee sent out
<hi>Mac Guir</hi> with a number of rifeling robbers, to
spoile and prey vpon the peaceable subiects,
with whom Sir <hi>Warram Saint Leger</hi> met, and
at the first incounter ranne <hi>Mac Guir</hi> through
the body with a Lance, and was likewise runne
through with <hi>his</hi> Lance. Whereupon <hi>Tyrone</hi>
made ready to returne from <hi>Monster</hi> sooner
then was expected, or himselfe meant.</p>
            <p>At this time, <hi>Charles Blunt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno 1600.</note> Lord <hi>Mountioy,</hi>
was sent Lord Lieuetenant generall into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
At his first comming, hearing that <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone</hi>
was to depart out of <hi>Monster,</hi> hee hastened
to stop his passage in <hi>Feriall,</hi> and there to giue
him battell, which the Earle preuented by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
another way, hauing intelligence of the
Lord Generall his designes. The spring draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on, the <hi>Deputy</hi> put himselfe in his march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Vlster,</hi> with purpose to driue the Earle to
a stand. In the meane time Sir <hi>Henry Docwray</hi>
at <hi>Loughfoil,</hi> and Sir <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>thew Morgan</hi> at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishanon</hi>
planted the Garrisons, which they ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with small resistance, and repressed the
Rebels in diuers ouerthrowes.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Generall</hi> likewise held <hi>Tyrone</hi> very
hard, and with light skirmishes euer put him to
the worst: sothat he now perceiuing his fortunes
to decline, withdrew himselfe backwards into
his ould corners. The Lord <hi>Lieuetenant</hi> entred
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7927:90"/>
in <hi>Lease,</hi> the place of refuge and receit of all the
Rebels in <hi>Leinster,</hi> where hee shew <hi>Ony Mac
Rory-Og,</hi> chiefe of the family of the <hi>O Mores,</hi>
a bloudy, bould, and desperate yong man: and
so chased out the rest of his companions, as
that neuer since they were seene in those parts.
And though winter began to draw on, yet mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
hee forward to the entry of the <hi>Mairy,</hi>
three miles beyond <hi>Dundalk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The passage into <hi>Vlster</hi> is euery way naturally
cumbersome, and it was helped by the Rebels
who had fortified and blocked vp the entrance
with fences of stakes stucke in the ground, with
hurdles ioyned together, and stones in the
midst, with turfes of earth laid betweene hills,
woods and bogges, and manned the place with
a number of souldiers. But the <hi>English</hi> brake
through their <hi>Pallisadoes,</hi> and beate backe the
enemy. The Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> placed a garrison
eight miles from <hi>Armagh,</hi> where in memory
of Sir <hi>Iohn Norrice,</hi> he named the Fort <hi>Mount
Norrice.</hi> In his returne he had many skirmishes.
At <hi>Carlingford</hi> the enemies were assembled to
stop his way, but were all discomfited, and put
to flight. In the midst of winter hee entred the
<hi>Glinnes,</hi> that is, the vallies of <hi>Leinster,</hi> a secure
receptacle of the Rebels. There he brought into
subiection <hi>Donel Spanioh, Phelim Mac Pheogh,</hi>
and the <hi>O Tooles;</hi> of whom he tooke hostages.
Then went he to <hi>Fereall,</hi> and draue <hi>Tirell,</hi> the
most approued warriour of all the Rebels, from
his fastnesse (that is, his bogs and bushes) vnto
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7927:90"/>
               <hi>Vlster,</hi> and after some other good seruices done
here, the spring approaching, he marched into
<hi>Vlster,</hi> fortified <hi>Armaugh,</hi> and remoued <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone</hi>
from the Fort of <hi>Blacke-water,</hi> where hee
had fortified himselfe.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the <hi>Pope</hi> and the King of
<hi>Spaine</hi> laboured to maintaine the rebellion in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and to helpe <hi>Tyrone.</hi> Their agents were
a <hi>Spaniard</hi> elected Archbishop of <hi>Dublin</hi> by
the <hi>Pope,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Clowfort,</hi> the Bishop of
<hi>Killaloe,</hi> and <hi>Archer</hi> a <hi>Iesuite.</hi> These by <hi>prayers</hi>
and <hi>promises</hi> of heauenly rewards, <hi>perswaded</hi>
the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to send succours into <hi>Ireland,</hi>
which hee did, vnder the Generall, <hi>Don Iohn
d' Aquila,</hi> a man that conceiued great hopes, and
was confident of much aid from the titular
Earle <hi>Desmond,</hi> and <hi>Florence Mac Carly,</hi> a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell
of great power; wherein the man was much
deceiued; for Sir <hi>George Carew</hi> Lord Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of <hi>Munster,</hi> had preuented all his designes,
and sent them prisoners into <hi>England,</hi> where
they were fast. <hi>Don Aquila</hi> with two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<hi>Spaniards</hi> of old trained souldiers, with
certaine <hi>Irish</hi> fugitiues landed at <hi>Kinsale</hi> in
<hi>Monster,</hi> the last of <hi>October, Anno</hi> 1600. and
presently published a writing, wherein he stiled
himselfe <hi>Master Generall,</hi> and captaine of the
<hi>Catholike</hi> King in the warres of God, for hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and keeping the faith in <hi>Ireland:</hi> this drew
diuers distempered and cuill-affected persons
on his side.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> gathering his companies,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7927:91"/>
hasted to <hi>Kinsale,</hi> and incamped neere vnto
the Towne, on the land side. In the meane time,
Sir <hi>Richard Leuison,</hi> with two of the <hi>Queenes</hi>
shippes, inclosed the hauen, to forbid all accesse
to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Then on both sides the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
played vpon the towne.</p>
            <p>But newes was brought that two thousand
<hi>Spaniards</hi> more were arriued at <hi>Bere hauen,
Baltimor,</hi> and <hi>Castle hauen.</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
was imployed vpon them, in which seruice
he sunke fiue of their shippes. Vnto these new
landed <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whose Leader was <hi>Alfonso
o-campo, O-donel</hi> ouer the ice by speedy iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes
and vnknowne by-wayes repaired, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene
of the <hi>English.</hi> And a few dayes after, <hi>Tyrone</hi>
himselfe, with <hi>O Roik, Raimund, Burk,
Mac Mahun, Randall Mac Surly, Tirrell,</hi> the
Barron of <hi>Lixnawe,</hi> with the choise of the
Nobles, making sixe thousand foot, and fiue
hundreth horse. All confident of victory, being
fresh, strong, and more in number then the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi>
who were out-wearied with a winter siege
with scarcity of victuals, their horse weake with
fore trauell.</p>
            <p>In this hope <hi>Tyrone</hi> vpon an hill not a mile
from the <hi>English</hi> campe made a <hi>brauado</hi> two
dayes together, intending to haue put these new
supplies of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with eight hundreth <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,</hi>
by night into <hi>Kinsale,</hi> as did appeare by
letters intercepted from <hi>Don Aquila.</hi> To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
this, the Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> appointed eight En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
to keepe watch, and himselfe with the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7927:91"/>
               <hi>President</hi> of <hi>Monster,</hi> and the <hi>Marshall,</hi> at the
foot of the hill, chose out a conuenient plot to
giue the <hi>Earle</hi> battell; who the next morning
seeing the <hi>English</hi> so forward, by his bag-pipers
sounded the retreat; whom the Lord <hi>Generall</hi>
followed, and forced them to a stand in the
brinke of a bogge, where their horsemen were
disordered and routed by the Earle of <hi>Clan-Ricard.</hi>
The maine battell was charged by the
Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> himselfe, who discharged the
parts of a <hi>prouide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t</hi> Captaine, and of a <hi>valiant</hi>
souldier. The rebels not able to withstand him,
brake their arrayes, and fled confusedly in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order:
In the pursuit, many were slaine. <hi>Tyrone,
O-donel,</hi> and the rest flung away their weapons,
and shifted for themselues by flight. <hi>Alfonso
Ocampo,</hi> and sixe Ensigne bearers were taken
prisoners, nine of their Ensignes were born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by the <hi>English,</hi> and twelue hundreth <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards</hi>
slaine. This victory obtained, dismaied
both the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Kinsale,</hi> and the rebels.
<hi>Tyrone</hi> was forced into his starting holes in <hi>Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
O-donel</hi> fled into <hi>Spaine.</hi> The rest of the
Rebels were driuen to hide themselues.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Generall</hi> returning to the siege of
<hi>Kinsale,</hi> began to raise Rampires, and to mount
his Cannons nearer the towne, in which worke
sixe dayes were spent without any impeach
from the <hi>Spaniards. Don Aquila</hi> seeking now
to get cleare and be gone, sent his <hi>Lieuetenant</hi>
with the <hi>Drum-maior</hi> to the Lord <hi>Deputy;</hi>
wherein hee craued, that some Gentleman of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7927:92"/>
credit, might bee sent into the towne, with
whom he might parly for peace. The Lord <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty</hi>
sent Sir <hi>William Godolphin,</hi> to whom <hi>Don
Aquila</hi> signified, that hee had found the Lord
<hi>Deputy,</hi> though his eager enemy, yet an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
person: the <hi>Irish</hi> of no valour, <hi>rude,</hi> and
vnciuill, yea, and (that which hee sore feared)
<hi>persidious</hi> and false. That hee was sent from the
King of <hi>Spaine</hi> his Master, to aide two Earles,
and now he much doubted whether there were
any such <hi>in rerum natura;</hi> considering that one
tempestuous puffe of warre had blowne the
one of them into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the other into the
<hi>North,</hi> so as they were no more to bee seene:
willing therefore he was to treate about a pace,
that might bee good for the <hi>English,</hi> and not
hurtfull to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Albeit he wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
requisite to the holding out of the siege,
and expected euery day out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> fresh
supplies to finde the <hi>English</hi> worke and trouble
enough.</p>
            <p>The matter thus proposed,<note place="margin">Anno 1601.</note> the <hi>English</hi> being
weake, and wearied with a winter-siege, the
Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> consented to an agreement, vpon
these Articles.</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>Iohn d'Aquila</hi> should quit the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which he held in the Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
as well in the towne of <hi>Kinsale,</hi> as in the Forts
and Castle of <hi>Baltimar, Ber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and should deliuer them vnto the
Lord <hi>Deputy,</hi> or to whom hee should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:7927:92"/>2. That <hi>Don d' Aquila</hi> and his <hi>Spaniards</hi>
should depart with armes, money, munition,
and banners displayed. The souldiers notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to beare no Armes against the <hi>Queene</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> till such time as they were vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in some part of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That Ships and Victuals should be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them in their departure, for their money,
at such reasonable prises as the country could
afford.</p>
            <p>4. That if contrary windes inforced them
into any other part of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> they
might bee intreated as friends, with safety of
harbour and prouisions necessary for their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
            <p>5. That a <hi>cessation</hi> should be from warre, a
<hi>security</hi> from iniuries.</p>
            <p>6. That the Shippes in which they should
be imbarked, might freely passe by other <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Shippes, without molestation, and the
Shippes arriuing in <hi>Spaine,</hi> might safely returne
backe againe without any impeachment of the
<hi>Spaniards.</hi> For security whereof, the said <hi>Don
d' Aquila</hi> should deliuer for hostages such three
of their Captaines as the Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> would
choose. <hi>Tyrone</hi> seeing his hopes gone, his men
slaine, his restlesse conscience gaue him no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
hee shifted from place to place in much
feare and perplexity. In the meane time, the
Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> refreshed his weary and winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaten
souldiers, repaired the decayes, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Garrisons in <hi>Monster.</hi> This done, hee
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7927:93"/>
departed for <hi>Dublin.</hi> From thence toward the
spring, by an easie march well appointed, hee
returned into <hi>Vlster,</hi> meaning to belay the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
on euery side, by planting his Forts, so to
take him in his toile: thus comming to <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water</hi>
hee transported his Army ouer the Riuer
vpon floats,<note place="margin">Charles Mount.</note> and beneath the ould Fort, he ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

that he set on fire his owne house at <hi>Dunganon,</hi>

<hi>Deputy</hi> followed him close, spoiled the Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields,
and burnt the villages, and booties were
brought in on euery side. The Forts in <hi>Lough

                  </gap>naghan;</hi> whence
with their continuall sallies, they kept the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in such feare, that they hid themselues in
woods, complaining and exclaiming against
<hi>Tyrone,</hi> that had brought them all to ruine for
his priuate discontents, and began to repent
them so farre, as they made hast who should
first come in to the Lord <hi>Deputy.</hi> The Earle see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how the world went, thought good to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
the worst by his submission, which in
humble letters he sent to the <hi>Queene,</hi> who gaue
the Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> authority to pardon his life,
though hardly drawne to remit his offences, his
friends daily solicited the Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> for his
peace; which at last was granted, to put his
life and reuenues without any condition, to the
will of the <hi>Queene.</hi> Whereupon all <hi>Mellifont</hi>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:7927:93"/>
accompanied with two persons and no more,
he had accesse to the Chamber of Presence,
where the Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> sate in a Chaire of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.
<hi>Tyrone</hi> in base and poore array, with a
deiected countenance, at the first entrance, fell
downe vpon his knees, and so rested, till hee
was commanded to arise; and comming neerer,
stepping two paces, he fell downe prostrate, and
with great submiss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>on acknowledged his <hi>sinnes</hi>
against <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>fault</hi> against her <hi>Maiesty.</hi>
The next day the Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> departing from
<hi>Dublin,</hi> tooke <hi>Tyrone</hi> thither, meaning to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
him for <hi>England.</hi> But the death of Queene
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> staied that designe, and King <hi>Iames</hi>
succeeding, and being receiued with admirable
loue of all sorts, at his first entrance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ardoned
<hi>Tyrone.</hi> And <hi>Ireland</hi> hath beene since held in
greater peace then euer in the memory of any
stories hath beene formerly knowne.</p>
            <p>After all this, <hi>Tyrone,</hi> a man not framed for a
peaceable course, but onely for trouble, fell into
his last pageant, in this manner. <hi>Montgomery</hi> was
made Lord Bishop of <hi>Derry,</hi> (who was after,
Lord Bishop of <hi>Meath)</hi> and because the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of that of <hi>Derry</hi> and some other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprickes
neare adioyning were so much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
that they were no way able to make a
reasonable maintenance; the Bishop sought by
lawfull meanes to get some Lands taken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
right or law from his Bishopricke, and to
recouer things desperately lost, if hee could.
This thing could not be effected, without the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7927:94"/>
offence of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> who had gotten into his
hands the greatest part of the Bishoprick
lands. In so much, that <hi>Tyrone</hi> vnderstanding
the Bishop sought to recouer the Lands of the
Bishopricke, told the Bishop thus much: <hi>My
Lord you haue two or three Bishoprickes, and
yet you are not content with them, you seeke the
Lands of my Earledome. My Lord,</hi> quoth the
Bishop, <hi>your Earledome is swolne so bigg with
the Lands of the Church, that it will burst if it
be not vented.</hi> The Bishop intending in a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
course to recouer the Lands lost, found
that there was no man could giue him better
light and knowledge of those things, then <hi>O
Cane,</hi> who had beene great with <hi>Tyrone:</hi> and
to make vse of him was a matter of difficulty;
yet some meanes being vsed to him, he came of
his owne accord to the Bishop, and tould him
that he could helpe him to the knowledge of
that which he sought, but he was afraid of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone:
nay</hi> said the Bishop, <hi>I will not trust you,
for I know that one bottle of Aqua vitae will
draw you from me to Tyrone.</hi> Whereupon hee
tooke a Booke and laid it on his head, saying,
<hi>ter liuro, ter liuro:</hi> which as my Lord of <hi>Meath</hi>
said, (who tould me this story) is one of the
greatest kinde of affirming a truth which the
<hi>Irish</hi> haue, and after this ceremony performed,
they keepe their promise: <hi>O Cane</hi> vsing this ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,
promised to reu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ale all that hee knew
in that matter, if hee would on the other side
promise him to saue him from the violence
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7927:94"/>
of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and not to deliuer him into <hi>England;</hi>
which he promised to doe. Whereupon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
resolued to bring him to the Councell of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> there to take his confession; as they
came along by <hi>Dungannon, Tyrones</hi> Sonne
came forth with sixteene horsemen, but finding
the Bishop well appointed and guarded with
men, tould him that he came forth onely to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
his Lordship some part of the way, and so
after, he rode with him a reasonable way, tooke
his leaue and returned. The Bishop feared that
hee came to take <hi>O Cane</hi> from him, and thought
that he meant to doe it, if the Bishop had not
beene better prouided then he was. Thus they
comming peaceably to the Councell, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of <hi>O Cane</hi> was taken. After this, Processe
were sent to <hi>Tyrone</hi> to warne him to come at an
appointed time, to answere to the suit of the
Lord Bishop of <hi>Derry.</hi> There was no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
then, but in a peaceable manner to bring
the suit to a triall. But behold the <hi>burthen</hi> of an
<hi>euill conscience. Tyrone</hi> had entred into a new
conspiracie, to raise another rebellion; of this
conspiracy was <hi>O Cane.</hi> This thing was secret,
the Councell knew nothing of it. <hi>Tyrone</hi> being
serued with Processe to answere the suit, began
to suspect that this was but a plot to draw him
in; that surely all the treason was reuealed by

               <hi>lowest</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> And declaring his constant

his Coronation till Saint <hi>Iames</hi> day. In

was to surprize the <hi>King,</hi> and Prince <hi>Henry.</hi> Of

obtaine their owne pardons, a tolleration of

To conceale this treason, <hi>Watson</hi> the

with <hi>Clark,</hi> another <hi>Priest</hi> taught; <hi>that the act
was lawfull, being done before the Coronation:</hi>
for that the <hi>King</hi> was <hi>no King</hi> before hee was
<hi>annointed,</hi> and the Crowne solemnly set vpon

            <p>The other persons inuolued in this practise,

Sir <hi>Edward Parham, Brooksly, Coply, Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
and <hi>Clark.</hi> The <hi>inditement</hi> was, that they
had conspired, first to destroy the King; then
to raise rebellion, to alter Religion, to subuert
the State, to procure forraine inuasion. These
their intents they had made known to the Lord
<hi>Gray,</hi> whom they intended to make Earle <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall</hi>

from the King to doe that he did, onely to
trie faithfull subiects; but being required
to shew his Commission, hee could produce
none. Sir <hi>Griffin Markham,</hi> excepting onely
the imputation of bloud, confessed his offence
penitently; alledging it was through a discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
minde, and desired the Lords to bee a
meane to the <hi>King</hi> for mercy <hi>Watson</hi> and
<hi>Clark,</hi> (the former of which confessed that he
had drawne all those Gentlemen into those
plots) like true <hi>Roman Priests,</hi> auerred that
they held the <hi>King</hi> for <hi>no King,</hi> vntill hee was
<hi>crowned:</hi> and therefore it could not be <hi>treason:</hi>
alledging that <hi>Saul</hi> was no King, till hee was
chosen in <hi>Mispeh,</hi> though hee had beene an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
in <hi>Ramoth</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Samuel.</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:7927:99"/>
Neither <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> who in the dayes of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
had beene confirmed by the Prophet to
raigne ouer <hi>Israel,</hi> vntill the people made him
King, vpon the foolish answere of <hi>Rehoboam:</hi>
making no difference betweene the mediate and
<hi>ordinary</hi> succession of lawfull Kings in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths
established: and those which God
himselfe <hi>extraordinarily</hi> aduanced to be scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to an vngratefull land. It was tould them
that in <hi>England the King neuer dieth,</hi> that
there is no <hi>interregnum,</hi> that the Coronation
is but a ceremony to shew the King to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Two dayes after was Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh</hi>
brought to the barre, hee was indited for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining
with the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> (his accuser as
it was said in the foresaid designes) he pleaded,
not guilty, and so stood for his purgation. Hee
pleaded for himselfe a long time, and with some
admiration of men, who thought that a man of
such vnderstanding would hardly bee drawne
into a plot so <hi>foule,</hi> and so <hi>foolish:</hi> yet hee was
found guilty, and had sentence of death.</p>
            <p>The like iudgement, a few dayes after, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
vpon the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> and <hi>Gray,</hi> arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on two seuerall dayes. The former was indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for combining with Sir <hi>Walter Ralegh,</hi> and
<hi>George Brooke</hi> to procure forces from the King
of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> for inuasion:
the other for ioyning with the foresaid <hi>Priests,
Knights,</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen</hi> in their conspiracies.
Sir <hi>Edward Parham</hi> was only acquitted by the
Iury. Of the rest, onely three died. <hi>Watson,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7927:100"/>
Clark,</hi> and <hi>George Brooke. Watson</hi> had before in

of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> and at his death left this sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
on them, that they in reuenge, had cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
drawne him into this action, which
brought him to his end. After this the Lords
<hi>Cobham</hi> and <hi>Gray,</hi> and Sir <hi>Griffin Markham</hi>
were by a Warrant to be executed the <hi>Friday</hi>
next. But the <hi>King</hi> inclined to mercy, sent at the
day appointed a Pardon for them; the manner
whereof was such, as gaue vnexpected ioy to
them that looked for nothing but death. The
Pardon was brought to the place where they
were to be executed, by Master <hi>Gibb</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
so secretly, that none present vnderstood
any thing thereof: Sir <hi>Griffin Markham</hi> was

to the contrary; who vnderstanding his

            <p>This attempt seemed to be a matter of lesse

            </p>
            <p>This treason was first thought on in the last

the Superiour of the <hi>malignants</hi> here, <hi>Cates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi>
and others sent <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> into <hi>Spaine,</hi>
to negotiate with the <hi>Spanish King</hi> in the name
of the <hi>English Catholikes:</hi> First to send an army
to them, who were now in readinesse to ioyne

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7927:101"/>
in <hi>England:</hi> And thirdly, <hi>Winter</hi> was to
giue aduertisement of the discontents that the
young Gentlemen and Soldiers had conceiued
vpon the death of <hi>Essex,</hi> whereby a fit occasion
was offered to forward the <hi>popish</hi> cause. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
this businesse, hee made for his meanes,
Father <hi>Creswell</hi> the leiger <hi>Iesuite</hi> in <hi>Spaine, Don
Petro Francesa</hi> second secretary to the State, and
the Duke of <hi>Lerma:</hi> all which assured <hi>Winter</hi>
that the office of his imploiment would be
very gratefull to his Master. The place of land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
concluded vpon by them was <hi>Kent</hi> or <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex</hi>
if the Kings Army were great, if otherwise,
then <hi>Milford hauen</hi> in <hi>Wales</hi> was held fittest.
With these and other like pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And lastly had answer by the Count <hi>Miranda,</hi>
that the King would bestow an hundreth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
crownes towards the expedition, halfe
thereof to be payed that yeare, and the rest the
next Spring, when at the farthest hee meant to
set foot in <hi>England.</hi> On whose behalfe hee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>English Catholikes</hi> to maintaine their

            <p>
               <hi>Winter</hi> thus laden with hopes, returned
from <hi>Spaine,</hi> and acquainted <hi>Garnet, Catesby,</hi>

related to others. All were glad to heare the

But before the next Spring, Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
died. To giue notice of her death, <hi>Christopher

instantly that some <hi>Spaniards</hi> might bee

and desire of seeke to reclaime others from the
same, he presently falleth from all princely power
and dignity, and that also by vertue and power
of the law it selfe both diuine and humane, euen
before any sentence pronounced against him by
the supreame Pastor and Iudge.</hi> And that his
Subiects, of what estate or condition soeuer, are
freed from all bond of oath of alleageance
which at any time they had made vnto him as
to their lawfull Prince. Nay, that they both
may and ought (prouided they haue competent
strength and force) cast out such a man from
bearing rule among <hi>Christians,</hi> as an <hi>Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
an <hi>Heretike,</hi> a <hi>Back-slider,</hi> a <hi>Reuolter</hi> from

turne them from the faith: yea they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
further, <hi>that if a Prince shall but fauour
or shew countenance to an Heretike, he presently
looseth his Kingdome.</hi> By this fiery diuinity of
their owne making, or receiuing it from the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of error and doctrines of diuels, (for those
things that are taught for doctrines, not being

much more they that are contrary to the
doctrines of Gods word) by these doctrines
the <hi>Gunpowder-treason</hi> tooke strength. The
<hi>Parliament</hi> dissolued the <hi>seauenth</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and
was prorogued vntill the <hi>seauenth</hi> of <hi>February</hi>

he would venture his life. But he proposed
difficulties, as want of an house, and of one to

<hi>Winter</hi> passed the seas, and found the <hi>Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
at <hi>Bergen</hi> neare <hi>Dunkirk:</hi> where by helpe of
Master <hi>Owen</hi> hee deliuered his message. Whose
answere was, that he had strict command from
his Master, to doe all good offices for the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes,</hi>
and for his owne part hee thought
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7927:103"/>
himselfe bound in conscience so to doe, and that
no good occasion should bee omitted, but hee
spake to him nothing of this matter.</p>
            <p>Returning to <hi>Dunkirk</hi> with Master <hi>Owen</hi>
they had speech whether the <hi>Constable</hi> would
faithfully helpe them, or no: <hi>Owen</hi> said, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
nothing lesse, and that they sought one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               </gap> ends, holding small accompt of
<hi>Catholikes. Winter</hi> told him, that there were
many Gentlemen in <hi>England,</hi> who would not
forsake their Countrey vntill they had tried
the vttermost. And to add one more to their
company, as a fit man both for councell and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of whatsoeuer they should resolue, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
for Master <hi>Fawkes,</hi> who as he had heard,
was a man of good commendation. <hi>Owen</hi> told
him, the gentleman deserued no lesse, but was
at <hi>Brussels,</hi> and that if he came not, as happily
he might before <hi>Winters</hi> departure, hee would
send him shortly after into <hi>England. Winter</hi>
went shortly after to <hi>Ostend;</hi> where Sir <hi>William
Stanly</hi> as then was not, but came two dayes
after. <hi>Winter</hi> remained with him three or foure
dayes. In which time he asked him, if the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes</hi>
in <hi>England</hi> should doe any thing to
helpe themselues, whether hee thought the
<hi>Arch-Duke</hi> would second them? he answered,
no. For all those parts w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re so desirous of peace

to set any pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Winter</hi> told him there was no such

resolution, and fell into other speech; asking him
of Master <hi>Fawkes,</hi> whom Sir <hi>William</hi> much
commended: and as they were in speech,
<hi>Fawkes</hi> came in. Sir <hi>William</hi> told him, this is the
Gentleman you spake of; and after they had
imbraced, <hi>Winter</hi> told <hi>Fawkes,</hi> that some good
friends of his wished his company in <hi>England,</hi>
and appointed to meet at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> where they
might conferre. Meeting at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> they had
conference, and resolued both to come into
<hi>England.</hi> They came first to <hi>Catesby:</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
came Master <hi>Thomas Percy.</hi> The first
word he spake after he came into their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
was, <hi>Shall we alwaies, Gentlemen, talke, and
neuer doe any thing? Catesby</hi> tooke him aside,
and had speech of somewhat to be done, so as
first they might all take an oath of secrecy;
which within few dayes after, they did. The
oath was this: <hi>You shall sweare by the blessed
Trinity, and by the Sacrament you now purpose
to receiue, neuer to disclose, directly nor indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
you leaue.</hi> This oath was first taken by <hi>Catesby,
Percy, Wright</hi> and <hi>Fawkes,</hi> behinde Saint <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
After the oath taken, they went into the
next roome and heard <hi>Masse,</hi> and receiued the
<hi>Sacrament</hi> vpon it. That done, <hi>Catesby</hi> disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to <hi>Percy,</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> and <hi>Iacke Wright</hi> to
<hi>Fawkes</hi> the businesse, for which they tooke the
oath, which they approued. Then was <hi>Percy</hi>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:7927:104"/>
sent to take the house, which they vnderstood
did belong to one <hi>Ferris;</hi> which with some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
in the end he obtained, and became Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to <hi>Whinyard,</hi> as <hi>Ferris</hi> was before. <hi>Fawkes</hi>
vnderwent the name of Master <hi>Percy his man,</hi>
calling himselfe <hi>Iohnson;</hi> because his face was
most vnknowne, and receiued the keyes of the
house, vntill they heard that the <hi>Parliament</hi>
was adiourned to the 7. of <hi>February.</hi> At which
time they all departed seuerall wayes into the
Countrey, to meet againe at the beginning of
<hi>Michaelmas</hi> Tearme. It was thought conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to haue a house to receiue prouision of <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
and <hi>wood</hi> for the mine; from which house
the prouision might be conueied to that house
which <hi>Percy</hi> had taken: this was taken in <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
and <hi>Keyes</hi> was appointed the trusty <hi>keeper</hi>
thereof. When they were agreed to begin and
set things in order for the mine, they were staied
a while, because the <hi>Scottish</hi> Lords were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to sit in conference of the <hi>Vnion</hi> in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
his house.</hi> The time of their sitting being past,
they entred vpon the mine, hauing prouided
themselues of baked meats, the lesse to need sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
abroad.</p>
            <p>Whilst they were together, they fell into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
what they should doe after this deede
was done. The first question was, how they
might surprise the next heire. The <hi>Prince</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
would be at <hi>Parliament</hi> with the <hi>King,</hi> his
Father: how should they then be able to seaze
vpon the <hi>Duke?</hi> This burden <hi>Percy</hi> vndertook,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7927:105"/>
that by his acquaintance, he with other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
would enter the Chamber without sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition,
and hauing some doozen others at seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
doores to expect his comming, and two or
three on horsebacke at the Court gate to receiue
him, he would vndertake (<hi>the blow being giuen,</hi>
vntill which hee would attend in the <hi>Dukes</hi>
Chamber) to carry him safe away: for he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
most of the Court would be absent, and
such as were there, not suspecting, or vnproui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for any such matter. For the <hi>Lady Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
it were easie to surprise her in the country,
by drawing friends together at an hunting
neare the Lord <hi>Harringtons,</hi> and <hi>Asby</hi> Master
<hi>Catesby</hi> his house being not farre off, was a fit
place for preparation The next was for money
and horses, which if they could prouide in any
reasonable measure (hauing the heire apparant)
and the first knowledge by foure or fiue dayes
was oddes sufficient. Then what Lords they
should saue from the <hi>Parliament,</hi> which was
first agreed in generall, as many as they could
that were <hi>Catholikes,</hi> or so disposed; but after
they descended to speake of particulars. Next
what <hi>forraine Princes</hi> they should acquaint
with this before, or ioyne with after. For this
point they agreed, that first they could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne
Princes to that secrecy, nor oblige them
by oath, so to be secure of their promise; beside,
they knew not whether they will approue the
proiect or dislike it. And if they doe allow ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
to prepare before, might beget suspition:
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:7927:105"/>
and not to prouide vntill the businesse were
acted; the same letter that carried the newes of
the thing done, might as well intreat their
helpe and furtherance. <hi>Spaine</hi> is too slow in
their preparations to hope any good from the
first extremities, and <hi>France</hi> too neere and to
dangerous, who with the Shipping of <hi>Holland,</hi>
we feared of all the world might make away
with vs. While they were in the middle of these
discourses, they heard that the <hi>Parliament</hi>
would be anew adiourned vntill after <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
vpon which tidings they brake off both
discourse and working. About <hi>Candlemas</hi> they
brought ouer in a Boat the powder which they
had prouided at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and laid it in Master
<hi>Percy</hi> his house; because they would haue all
their danger in one place. Then falling to their
worke in the mine, they came against the stone
wall, which was very hard to beat through, at
which time they called <hi>Kit Wright</hi> to their
company; but as they were working vpon the
wall they heard a rushing in a Cellar, of remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of coales. Whereupon they feared that
they had beene discouered, and they sent
<hi>Fawkes</hi> to goe to the Cellar; who finding that
the Coales were a selling, and that the
Cellar was to bee let, viewing the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
thereof for their purpose, <hi>Percy</hi> went and
hired the same for yearely rent. They had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this prouided twenty barrels of powder,
which they remoued into the Cellar, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

            <p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:7927:106"/>After this they thought fit to send <hi>Fawkes</hi>
to acquaint Sir <hi>William Stanly,</hi> and Master
<hi>Owen</hi> with this matter, but so that they might
receiue the oath of secrecy. The reason why
they desired Sir <hi>William Stanly</hi> should be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
herewith, was to haue him with them
so soone as he could. And for Master <hi>Owen,</hi> he
might hold good correspondencies after with
forraine Princes. Master <hi>Fawkes</hi> departed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Easter</hi> for <hi>Flanders,</hi> and returned in the
end of <hi>August.</hi> He brought word that Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Stanly</hi> was not returned from <hi>Spaine,</hi> so
as he vttered the matter onely to <hi>Owen,</hi> who
seemed well pleased with the businesse, but told
him that surely Sir <hi>William</hi> wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with any plot as hauing businesse now
a foot in the Court of <hi>England;</hi> but he himselfe
would be alwaies ready to tell him, and send
him away so soone as it were done.</p>
            <p>About this time Master <hi>Percy</hi> and <hi>Catesby</hi>
met at the <hi>Bathe.</hi> Where they agreed that the
company being yet but few, <hi>Catesby</hi> should
haue the others authority to call in whom hee
thought best. Whereupon he called in Sir <hi>Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard
Digby,</hi> and after that Master <hi>Tresham.</hi> The
first promised fifteene hundreth pounds, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
two thousand pounds. Master <hi>Percy</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
all that he could get of the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberlands</hi>
rents, which was about foure
thousand pounds, and to prouide many gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loping
horses, to the number of ten.</p>
            <p>Meane while, <hi>Fawkes</hi> and <hi>Winter</hi> bought
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7927:106"/>
somenew powder, as suspecting the first to bee
danke, and conueied it into the Cellar, and set
it in order, as they resolued it should stand.
Then was the <hi>Parliament</hi> anew prorogued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the fifth of <hi>Nouember.</hi> So that all of them
went down till some tenne dayes before. When
<hi>Catesby</hi> camevp with <hi>Fawks</hi> to an house by <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field-chase,</hi>
called <hi>White-webs;</hi> whether <hi>Winter</hi>

whether the young <hi>Prince</hi> came to the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Winter</hi> told him that hee heard that his

and prouision of more company to surprise the
<hi>Prince,</hi> and eaue the <hi>Duke</hi> alone.</p>
            <p>All things thus prepared: the <hi>Saturday</hi> of the
weeke immediately praeceding the <hi>Kings</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
which was vpon <hi>Thursday</hi> (being but
ten dayes before the <hi>Parliament)</hi> The Lord
<hi>Monteagle,</hi> sonne and heire to the Lord <hi>Morley,</hi>
being in his owne lodging ready to goe to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
at seauen of the clocke at night, one of his
footmen, whom hee had sent of an errand ouer
the street, was met by an vnknowne man of a
reasonable tall personage, who deliuered him a
Letter, charging him to put it into my Lord his
Masters hands: which my Lord no sooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
but that hauing broken it vp, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
the same to bee of an vnknowne, and
somewhat vnlegible hand, and without either
date or subscription; did call one of his men to
him for helping him to reade it. But no sooner
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7927:107"/>
did he conceiue the strange contents thereof, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he was somewhat perplexed what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
to make of it, (as whether of a <hi>matter</hi>
of <hi>consequence,</hi> as indeede it was, or whether
some <hi>foolish</hi> deuised <hi>Pasquill</hi> by some of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
to skarre him from his attendance at the
<hi>Parliament)</hi> yet did hee as a most dutifull and

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iall subiect, conclude not to conceale it, what
euer might come of it. Whereupon notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the latenesse and darkenesse of the
night in such a season of the yeare, he presently
repaired to his <hi>Maiesties</hi> Pallace at <hi>White hall,</hi>
and there deliuered the same to the Earle of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury</hi>
his Maiesties principall <hi>Secretary.</hi> The
<hi>Earle</hi> hauing read the Letter, and heard of the
manner of comming of it to his hands, did
greatly incourage and commend the <hi>Lord</hi> for
his discretion; te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ling him plainely, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
the purpose of the Letter might proue
hereafter, yet did this accident put him in mind
of diuers aduertisements hee had receiued from
beyond the seas, wherewith he had acquainted
as well the <hi>King</hi> himselfe, as diuers of his Priuy
<hi>Councellours,</hi> concerning some businesse the
<hi>Papists</hi> were in, both at home and abroad, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
preparation for some combination among
them against this <hi>Parliament</hi> time: for inabling
them to deliuer at that time to the <hi>King</hi> some
petition for tolleration of Religion, which
should be deliuered in some such order, and so
well backed, as the <hi>King</hi> should be loath to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
their requests; like the <hi>sturdy-beggars</hi>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:7927:107"/>
crauing almes with one <hi>open</hi> hand, but carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>stone</hi> in the other in case of refusall. And
therefore did the Earle of <hi>Salisbury</hi> conclude
with the Lord <hi>Monteagle,</hi> that he would in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the <hi>Kings</hi> absence impart the same Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to some more of his Maiesties Councell.
Whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eof the Lord <hi>Monteagle</hi> liked well, onely
adding this request, by way of protestation,
that whatsoeuer the euent hereof might proue,
it should not be imputed to him, as proceeding
from too light and too sodaine an apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that hee deliuered this Letter being onely
moued thereto for demonstration of his ready
deuotion and care for preseruation of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
and the State. And thus did the Earle of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury</hi>
presently acquaint the Lord <hi>Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine</hi>
with the said Letter. Whereupon they
two in the presence of the Lord <hi>Monteagle,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to minde the former intelligence already
mentioned, which seemed to haue some relation
with this Letter; the tender care which they
euer had to the preseruation of his <hi>Maiesties</hi>
person, made them apprehend, that some pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous
attempt did thereby appeare to be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
against the same, which did the more neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerne the Lord <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> to haue
care of, in regard that it doth belong to the
charge of his office, to ouersee as well all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Assembly</hi> where his <hi>Maiesty</hi> is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire,
as his <hi>Highnesse</hi> owne priuate houses.
And therefore did the said two <hi>Councellors</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that they should ioyne vnto them three
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7927:108"/>
more of the Councell, to wit, the Lord <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi>
the Earles of <hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Northampton,</hi>
to be also particularly acquainted with this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.
Who hauing all of them concurred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to the re-examination of the contents of
the said Letter, they did conclude, that how
slight a matter it might at the first appeare to
be, yet was it not absolutely to be contemned,
in respect of the care which it behoued them to
haue of the preseruation of his Maiesties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
But yet resolued for two reasons, first to
acquaint the <hi>King</hi> himselfe with the same, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they proceeded to any further inquisition
in the matter, as well for the <hi>expectation</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi>
they had of his Maiesties fortunate
iudgement in clearing and soluing of obscure
riddles and doubtfull mysteries, as also because
the more time would in the meane while bee
giuen for the practise to ripen, if any was, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the discouery might be the more cleare and
euident, and the ground of proceeding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
more safe, iust, and easie. And so accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their determination did the Earle of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury</hi>
repaire to the <hi>King</hi> in his gallery vpon
<hi>Friday,</hi> being <hi>Alhallow</hi> day, in the afternoon,
which was the day after his Maiesties arriuall,
and none but himselfe being present with his
<hi>Highnesse</hi> at that time: Where without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
speech or iudgement giuen of the Letter,
but onely relating simply the forme of the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
thereof, he presented it to his Maiesty; the
contents of the Letter are as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:7927:108"/>My Lord, out of the loue I beare to some of
your friends, I haue a care of your preseruation.
Therefore I would aduise you, as you tender your
life, to deuise some excuse to shift off your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
at this Parliament. For God and man
haue concurred to punish the wickednesse of this
time. And thinke not slightly of this aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but retire your selfe into your Country,
where you may expect the euent in safety: for
though there be no appearance of any stirre, yet I
say, they shall receiue a terrible blow this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and yet they shall not see who hurt them.
This counsell is not to be contemned, because it
may doe you good, and can doe you no harme: for
the danger is past as soone as you shall haue bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
this Letter. And I hope God will giue you
the grace to make good vse of it. To whose holy
protection I commend you.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> no sooner read the letter, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a little pause, and then reading it ouer again,
he deliuered his iudgement of it in such sort, as
he thought it was not to bee contemned. For
that the stile of it seemed to be more quicke and
pithy, then is vsuall to be in a <hi>pasquill</hi> or <hi>libell,</hi>
(the superfluities of idle braines.) But the Earle
of <hi>Salisbury</hi> perceiuing the <hi>King</hi> to apprehend
it deeplier then he looked for, knowing his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
told him, that he thought by one sentence
in it, that it was like to be written by some <hi>fool</hi> or
<hi>mad man,</hi> reading to him this sentence in it: <hi>for
the danger is past as soone as you haue burned the
Letter:</hi> which he said was like to be the saying
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7927:109"/>
of a foole. For if the danger was past so soone as
the Letter was burnt, then the warning behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to be of little auaile, when the burning of
the Letter might make the danger to bee es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed.
But the <hi>King</hi> by the contrary conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the former sentence in the Letter. That
they should <hi>receiue a terrible blow at this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and yet should not see who hurt them:</hi>
ioyning it to the sentence immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already alleadged, did thereupon conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
that the <hi>danger</hi> mentioned, should bee
some <hi>sudden</hi> danger by <hi>blowing vp of powder:</hi>
for no other insurrection, rebellion, or whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
other priuate or desperate attempt could
be committed, or attempted in time of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and the authors thereof v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>seene, except
it were onely by a blowing vp of powder,
which might be performed by one base knaue
in a darke corner. Whereupon he was moued
to interpret and construe the latter sentence in
the Letter, (alleadged by the Earle of <hi>Salisbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)</hi>
against all ordinary sense and construction
in <hi>Grammer,</hi> as if by these words, <hi>for the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is past as soone as you haue burned the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
should be closely vnderstood the sudden
and quicknesse of the danger, which should be
as quickly performed, and at an end, as that
paper should be of bleasing vp in the fire; tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that word, <hi>as soone,</hi> to that sense of, <hi>as
quickly.</hi> And therefore wished that before his
going to <hi>Parliament,</hi> the vnder-roomes of the
<hi>Parliament house</hi> might be well and narrowly
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7927:109"/>
searched. It must be confessed that God put this
vnderstanding in the <hi>Kings</hi> heart. For albeit
now vpon the euent made knowne, a man may
easily see that no other construction can bee
made of the Letter, then that which the <hi>King</hi>
made: yet before the euent was knowne, the
wisest did not apprehend that vnderstanding.
And therefore we must acknowledge that God
would haue it knowne and brought to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
by the <hi>King</hi> himselfe, that all the body
of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> might rest most vnder God,
beholding to the <hi>King, their head</hi> for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
deliuerance. The Earle of <hi>Salisbury</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
at his Maiesties commentary, which hee
knew to be farre contrary to his ordinary and
naturall disposition, who did rather euer sinne
vpon the other side, in not apprehending nor
trusting due aduertisments of <hi>practises</hi> and <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils</hi>
when hee was duely informed of them,
whereby hee had many times drawne himselfe
into many desperate dangers, and interpreting
rightly this extraordinary caution at this time
to proceed from the vigilant care he had of the
whole state, more then of his owne person,
which could not but haue all perished together
if this designement had succeeded: he thought
good to dissemble still vnto the <hi>King</hi> that there
had beene any iust cause of such apprehension.
And ending the purpose with some merry ieast
vpon this subiect, as his custome is, tooke his
leaue for that time.</p>
            <p>But though hee seemed so to neglect it to his
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7927:110"/>
Maiestie, yet his customable and watchfull care
of the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>State</hi> still boyling within
him; and hauing with the blessed <hi>Virgin Mary,
laid vp in his heart</hi> the <hi>Kings</hi> so strange iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and construction of it, he could not bee
at rest till hee acquainted the foresaid <hi>Lords</hi>
what had passed betweene the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>him</hi> in
priuate. Whereupon they were all so earnest to
renew againe the memory of the same purpose
to his Maiestie, as it was agreed, that he should
the next day being <hi>Saturday</hi> repaire to his
<hi>Highnesse.</hi> Which hee did in the same priuy
Gallery, and renewed the memory thereof, the
Lord <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> then being present with the
<hi>King.</hi> At which time it was determined that
the said Lord <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> should according
to his custome and office, view all the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
houses</hi> both aboue and below, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what likelihood or appearance of any such
danger might possibly be gathered by the sight
of them. But yet as well for staying of idle ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
as for being the more able to discerne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mystery the nearer that things were in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse,
his iourney thither was ordained to be
deferred till the afternoone before the sitting
downe of the <hi>Parliament,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nouemb. 5. Anno 1605.</note> which was vpon the
<hi>Munday</hi> following. At what time he (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his conclusion) went to the <hi>Parliament
house,</hi> accompanied with the Lord <hi>Monteagle,</hi>
being in zeale to the <hi>Kings</hi> seruice earnest and
curious to see the euent of that accident, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he had the fortune to be the first discouerer.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7927:110"/>
Where hauing viewed all the lower roomes, he
found in the vault vnder the vpper house great
store of prouision of Billets, Faggots, &amp; Coales.
And inquiring of <hi>Whinyard</hi> keeper of the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drop,
to what vse hee had put those lower
roomes, and cellars: he told him that <hi>Thomas
Percy</hi> had hired both the House and part of the
Cellar or Vault vnder the same. And that the
wood and coale therein was the said Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
owne prouision. Whereupon the Lord
<hi>Chamberlaine</hi> casting his eye aside, perceiued a
fellow standing in a corner there, calling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
the said <hi>Percy</hi> his man, and keeper of that
house for him, which was <hi>Guido Fawkes,</hi> the
instrument which should haue acted that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
tragedy.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> looking vpon all
things with an heedfull eye, yet in outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
with but a carelesse and racklesse
countenance, he presently addressed himselfe to
the <hi>King</hi> in the said priuy Gallery, where in the
presence of the Lord <hi>Treasurer,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall,</hi>
the Earles of <hi>Worcester, Northampton,</hi>
and <hi>Salisbury,</hi> he made his report what he had
seene and obserued there. Noting that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teagle</hi>
had told him, that hee no sooner heard
<hi>Thomas Percy</hi> named to be the possessour of
that house, but considering both his backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in Religion, and the old dearenesse in
friendship betweene himselfe and the said <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
he did greatly suspect the matter, and that
the Letter should come from him. The Lord
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7927:111"/>
               <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> also told, that he did not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a little at the extraordinary great prouision
of wood and coale in that house, where <hi>Thomas
Percy</hi> had so seldome occasion to remaine: as
likewise it gaue him in his minde that his man
looked like a very tall and desperate fellow.
This could not but increase the <hi>Kings</hi> former
apprehension and iealousie. Whereupon he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,
as before, that the house was narrowly
to bee searched, and that those Billets and
Coales would bee searched to the bottome,
it being most suspitious that they were
laid there onely for <hi>couering</hi> of the <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
Of this same minde also were all the
<hi>Councellors</hi> then present. But vpon the
fashion of making the search, was it long
debated. For on the one side they were all
so iealous of the <hi>Kings</hi> safety, that they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,
that there could not be too much cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vsed for preuenting the danger: And yet on
the other part, they were all extreame loath and
dainty, that in case this Letter should proue to
be nothing but the euaporation of an idle braine,
then a curious search being made, and nothing
found, should not onely turne to the generall
scandall of the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>State,</hi> as being so
susp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tious of euery light and friuolous toy, but
likewise lay an ill-fauoured imputation vpon
the Earle of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> one of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
greatest Subiects and Councellors, this
<hi>Thomas Percy</hi> being his kinseman, and most
confident familiar. And the rather were they
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7927:111"/>
curious vpon this point, knowing how farre the
<hi>King</hi> detested to be thought suspitious or iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of any of his good subiects, though of the
meanest degree. And therefore though they all
agreed vpon the maine ground, which was to
prouide for the security of the <hi>Kings</hi> person,
yet did they much differ in circumstances, by
which this action might bee best carried with
lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t dinne and occasion of slander. But the
King himselfe still persisting that there were
diuers shrewd appearances, and that a narrow
search of those places could preiudice no man
that was innocent, he at last plainely resolued
them, that either must all the parts of those
roomes be narrowly searched, and no possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of danger left vnexamined, or else hee and
they all must resolue not to meddle in it at all,
but plainely to goe the next day to the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and leaue the successe to fortune, which
he beleeued they would be loath to take vpon
their consciences: for in such a case as this, an
<hi>halfe-doing</hi> was <hi>worse</hi> then <hi>no doing</hi> at all.
Whereupon it was at last concluded, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
should be left vnsearched in those houses.
And yet for the better colour and stay of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
in case nothing were found, it was thought
meet, that vpon a pretence of <hi>Whinyards</hi> mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
some of the <hi>Kings</hi> stuffe or hangings which
he had in keeping, all those roomes should bee
narrowly ripped for them. And to this purpose
was Sir <hi>Thomas Kneuet,</hi> (a Gentleman of his
Maiesties priuie Chamber) imployed, being a
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7927:112"/>
Iustice of Peace in <hi>Westminster,</hi> and one, of
whose ancient fidelity both the late <hi>Queene,</hi>
and our now <hi>Soueraigne</hi> haue had large proofe.
Who according to the trust committed vnto
him, went about the midnight next after, to
the <hi>Parliament</hi> house, accompan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed with such

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rrand. But
before his entry into the house, finding <hi>Thomas
Percyes</hi> alleadged man standing without the
doores, his Cloathes and Bootes on at so dead
a time of night, he resolued to apprehend him,
as he did, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eafter went forward to the
searching of the house. Where after hee had
caused to be ouerturned some of the Billets and
Coales, he first found one of the small Barrels
of powder, and after, all the rest, to the number
of <hi>thirty sixe barrels</hi> great and small. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
searching the fellow whom he had taken,
found three matches; and all other instruments
fit for blowing vp the powder, ready vpon him;
which made him instantly confesse his owne
guiltinesse: declaring also vnto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if hee
had happened to be within the house, when he
tooke him, as he was immediately before (at
the ending of his wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ke) hee would not haue
failed to haue blowne him vp, house and all.</p>
            <p>Thus after Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> had caused the wretch
to be surely bound, and well guarded by the
company he had brought with him, he himselfe
returned back to the <hi>Kings</hi> Pallace, and gaue
warning of his successe to the Lord <hi>Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine,</hi>
and Earle of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who immediately
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:7927:112"/>
warning the rest of the <hi>Councell</hi> that lay in the
house, as soone as they could get themselues
ready, came with their fellow <hi>Councellors</hi> to
the <hi>Kings</hi> Bed-chamber, being at that time
neere foure of the clocke in the morning. And
at the first entry of the Kings Chamber doore,
the Lord <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> being not any longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to conceale his ioy for the preuenting of so
great a danger, told the <hi>King</hi> in a confused hast,
that all was found and discouered, and the
traitor in hands and fast bound.</p>
            <p>Then order being first taken for sending for
the rest of the <hi>Councell</hi> that lay in the to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne,
the prisoner himselfe was brought into the
house. Where in respect of the strangenesse of
the accident, no man was staied from the sight
in speaking with him: and within a while after
the <hi>Counce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> did examine him. Who seeming
to put on a <hi>Roman-resolution,</hi> did both to the
<hi>Councell,</hi> and to euery other person that spake
to him that day, appeare so constant and set<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed
in his grounds, as they all thought they had
found a new <hi>Mutius Scaeuola</hi> borne in <hi>England.</hi>
For notwithstanding the horrour of the fact,
the guilt of his conscience, his sudden surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
the terrour which should haue strucken
him by comming into the presence of so graue
a <hi>Councell,</hi> and the restlesse and confused questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that euery man all that day did vexe him
with; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et was his countenance so farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deiected, as hee often smiled in scornefull
manner, not onely auowing the fact, but
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7927:113"/>
repenting onely, with the said <hi>Scaeuola,</hi> his fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in the execution thereof; whereof hee said,
the <hi>diuell</hi> and not <hi>God,</hi> was the <hi>discouerer:</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
quickly to euery mans obiections, scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing
at any idle questions which were propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to him, and iesting with such as he thought
had no authority to examine him. All that day
could the <hi>Councell</hi> get nothing out of him
touching his complices, refusing to answer to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such questions which he thought might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
his plot, &amp; laying all the blame vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
Whereunto, he said, he was moued onely
for <hi>Religion</hi> and conscience sake, denying the
<hi>King</hi> to be his <hi>lawfull Soueraigne,</hi> or the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
of God, in respect he was an <hi>Heretike,</hi>
and giuing himselfe no other name then <hi>Iohn
Iohnson,</hi> seruant to <hi>Thomas Percy.</hi> But the next
morning being carried to the Tower, hee did
not there remaine aboue two or three dayes,
being twice or thrice in that space re-examined,
and the racke onely offered, and shewed vnto
him, when the <hi>maske</hi> of his <hi>Romi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h fortitude</hi>
did visibly begin to weare and <hi>slide off</hi> his face.
And then did he begin to confesse part of the
truth, and thereafter to open the whole matter.
Out of his conscience, and especially out of the
confession of <hi>Thomas Winter</hi> haue we drawne
the praeceding narration. The confession of
<hi>Fawkes</hi> was taken presently after his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
The confession of <hi>Winter</hi> was taken the
23.<note place="margin">Anno 1605.</note> of <hi>Nouember,</hi> before the Lords of the
<hi>Councell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:7927:113"/>They that were first in the treason, and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the mine, were <hi>Robert Catesby, Robert
Winter,</hi> Esquires, <hi>Thomas Percy, Thomas Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Iohn Wright, Christopher Wright, Guido
Fawkes,</hi> Gentlemen; and <hi>Bates, Catesbyes</hi> man.
They that were made acquainted with it,
though not personally labouring in the mine,
nor in the cellar, were <hi>Euerard Digby</hi> Knight,
<hi>Ambrose Rookewood, Francis Tresham,</hi> Esquires.
<hi>Iohn Grant</hi> Gentleman, and <hi>Robert Keies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The newes was no sooner spread abroad that
morning, which was vpon a <hi>Tuesday,</hi> the 5. of
<hi>Nouember,</hi> and the first day designed for that
session of <hi>Parliament:</hi> but some of those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators,
namely <hi>Winter,</hi> and the two <hi>Wrights,</hi>
brethren, thought it high time for them to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
out of the towne, (for <hi>Catesby</hi> was gone
the night before, and <hi>Percy</hi> at foure of the
clocke in the morning the same day of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery)
and all of them held their course, with
more hast then good speed to <hi>Warwicke-shire</hi>
toward <hi>Couentry,</hi> where the next day morning
being <hi>Wednesday,</hi> and about the same houre
that <hi>Fawkes</hi> was taken in <hi>Westminster,</hi> one
<hi>Grant,</hi> a Gentleman, hauing associated to him
some others of his opinion, all violent <hi>Papists,</hi>
and strong <hi>Recusants,</hi> came to a stable of one

               </gap>me, carried along with
them all the great horses that were therein, to
the number of seauen or eight, belonging to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
Noblemen &amp; Gentlemen of that country,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7927:114"/>
who had put them into the riders hands to be

               </gap> fit for their seruice. And so both that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of them which fled out of <hi>London,</hi> as also
<hi>Grant</hi> and his complices met altogether at
<hi>Dunchurch</hi> at Sir <hi>Euerard Digby</hi> his lodging
the <hi>Tuesday</hi> at night after the discouery of this
treacherous attempt. The which <hi>Digby</hi> had
likewise for his part appointed a match of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to haue beene hunted the next day, which
was <hi>Wednesday,</hi> though his minde was <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod-like</hi>
vpon a farre other manner of <hi>hunting,</hi>
more bent vpon the bloud of <hi>reasonable men,</hi>
then of <hi>bruit beasts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This company and hellish society thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uened,
finding their <hi>purpose</hi> discouered, and
their <hi>treachery</hi> preuented, did resolue to runne
a <hi>desperate</hi> course, and since they could not
preuaile by so priuate a blow, to practise by a
publike rebellion, either to attain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
or at least to saue themselues in the throng
of others. And therefore gathering all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
they could vnto them, and pretending the
quarell of Religion, hauing intercepted such
prouision of armour, horses, and powder, as
the time could permit, thought by running vp
and downe the Country, both to augment
peece by peece their number: (dreaming to
themselues that they had the vertue of a <hi>snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball,</hi>
which being little at the first, and tumbling
downe a great hill, groweth to a great quantity,
by increasing it selfe with the snow that it mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

first this braue shew in one part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
should by their sympathy and example stir
vp and incourage the rest of their Religion in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts in <hi>England</hi> to rise, as they had done
there. But when they had gathered their force
to the greatest, they came not to the number of
fourescore. And yet were they troubled all the
houres of the day to keepe and containe their
owne seruants from stealing from them. Who
notwithstanding of all their care, dai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rre more in <hi>faith</hi> and iustnesse

               </hi>
to <hi>Worcestershire,</hi> and from thence to the

but onely by the ordinary <hi>Sheriff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>

were they all beaten, killed, taken, and

circumstance so a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iuely
displaying the greatnesse of Gods iustice, as it
could not be concealed without betraying in a
manner the glory due to the Almighty for the
same. Although diuers of the Kings <hi>Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
were posted downe after these traitors
with all speed possible; declaring the odious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the bloudy attempt, the necessity to
haue had <hi>Percy</hi> preserued aliue, if it had beene
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7927:115"/>
possible, and the assembly of that rightly-damned
crew, now no more <hi>darkened</hi> conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
but <hi>open</hi> and auowed Rebels: yet the farre
distance of the way, (which was aboue an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
miles) together with the extreame deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
thereof, ioyned also with the shortnesse
of the day, was the cause that the hearty and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
affections of the <hi>Kings</hi> good Subiects in
those parts preuented the speed of his <hi>proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
For vpon the third day after the flying
downe of these Rebels, which was vpon the
<hi>Friday</hi> next after the discouery of their plot,
they were most of them all surprised by the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe</hi>
of <hi>Worcestershire</hi> at <hi>Holbeach,</hi> about the
noone of the day, in manner following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grant,</hi> of whom mention was made before,
for the taking of the great horses, who had not
all the praeceding time stirred from his owne
house till the next morning after the attempt
should be put in execution, he then <hi>laying his
accompt without his Host,</hi> (as the <hi>prouerbe</hi> is)
that their plott had, without failing, receiued
the day before their hoped-for successe, tooke,
or rather stole out those Horses for inabling
him, and so many of that soul-lesse society that
had still remained in the Country neare about
him, to make a sudden surprise vpon the Kings
elder daughter, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> hauing her
residence neare to that place, whom they
thought to haue vsed for the colour of their
treacherous designe (his Maiestie her Father,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7927:115"/>
her Mother, and male-Children being all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
aboue.) And to this purpose also had
that <hi>Nimrod Digby</hi> prouided his hunting-match
against the same time, that numbers of
people being flocked together vpon the pretence
thereof, they might the easilier haue brought
to passe the sudden surprise of her person.</p>
            <p>Now the violent taking away of those horses
long before day, did seeme to be so great a riot
in the eyes of the common people, that knew
of no greater mystery: and the bold attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thereof did ingender such a suspition of
some following rebellion in the hearts of the
wiser sort, as both great and small began to stirre
and arme themselues, vpon this vnlooked-for
accident. Among whom Sir <hi>Fulk Greuil</hi> the
elder, Knight, as became one both so ancient in
yeeres, and good reputation, and by his office
being Deputy <hi>Lieuetenant</hi> of <hi>Warwickshire,</hi>
though vnable in his body, yet by the zeale
and true feruency of his minde, did first appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
this foresaid riot to bee nothing but the
sparkles or sure <hi>indices</hi> of a following rebellion.
Whereupon both stoutly and honestly he took
order to get into his owne hands the munition
and armour of all such Gentlemen about him,
as were either absent from their owne houses,
or in doubtfull guard, and also sent such directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the townes about him, as thereupon did
follow the striking of <hi>Winter</hi> by a poore Smith,
who had lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wise beene taken by those vulgar
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7927:116"/>
people, but that he was rescued by the rest of
his company, who perceiuing that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
before them had notice of them, hastened
away with losse in their owne sight, sixteene of
their followers being taken by the townesmen,
and sent presently to the <hi>Sheriffe</hi> at <hi>Warwicke,</hi>
and from thence to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before twelue or sixteene houres past,
<hi>Catesby, Percy,</hi> the <hi>Winters, Wrights, Rook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi>
and the rest, bringing then the assurance
that their maine plot was failed, and bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
whereupon they had builded the golden
mountaines of their glorious hopes: they then
tooke their last desperate resolution, to flock
together in a troupe, and wander as they did,
for the reasons aforetold. But as vpon the one
part, the zealous dutie to their God and their
Soueraigne was so deepely imprinted in the
hearts of all the meanest and poorest sort of the
people (although then knowing of no farther
mysterie, then such publike misbehauiours, as
their owne eyes taught them) as notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their faire shewes and pretence of their
<hi>Catholike</hi> cause, no creature, man or woman
through all the Country, would once so much
as giue them willingly a cup of drinke, or any
sort of comfort or support, but with execrations
detested them. So on the other part, the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffes</hi>
of the Shires where-through they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
conuening their people with all speed pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
hunted as hotly after them, as the euilnesse
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7927:116"/>
of the way, and the vnprouidednesse of their
people vpon that sudden could permit them.
And so at last after Sir <hi>Richard Verney</hi> Sheriffe
of <hi>Warwickeshire</hi> had carefully and straightly
beene in chase of them to the confines of his
County, part of the meaner sort being also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
by him: Sir <hi>Richard Walsh</hi> Sheriffe
of <hi>Worcestershire</hi> did likewise dutifully and hotly
pursue them through his Shire. And hauing
gotten sure triall of their taking harbour at the
house aboue-named,<note place="margin">Holbeach <hi>in</hi> Staffordshire, <hi>the house of</hi> Stephen Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> he sent Trumpetters and
messengers to them, commanding them in the
<hi>Kings</hi> name to render to him, his Maiesties
Minister; and knowing no more at that time of
their guilt, then was publikely visible, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
vpon their dutifull and obedient rendring
to him, to intercede at the <hi>Kings</hi> hands for the
sparing of their liues; who receiued onely from
them this scornefull answere (they being better
witnesses to themselues of their inward euil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences)
that he had need of better assistance,
then of those few numbers that were with him,
before hee could be able to <hi>command</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll
them.</p>
            <p>But here fell the wondrous worke of Gods
iustice, that while this message passed betweene
the <hi>Sheriffe</hi> and <hi>them:</hi> the <hi>Sheriffe</hi> and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
zeale being iustly kindled and augmented
by their arrogant answer, and so they prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
themselues to giue a furious assault: and
the other party making themselues ready with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7927:117"/>
the house to performe their promise by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
as resolute; it pleased God that in the
mending of the fire in their Chamber, one small
sparke should flye out, &amp; light among lesse then
two pound weight of <hi>Powder,</hi> which was dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a little from the Chimney: which being
thereby <hi>blowne vp,</hi> so maimed the faces of some
of the principall rebels, and the hands and sides
of other of them (blowing vp with it also a great
bag full of powder, which notwithstanding ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
tooke fire) as they were not onely disabled
and discouraged hereby from any farther resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
in respect <hi>Catesby</hi> himselfe, <hi>Rookwood,
Grant,</hi> and diuers others, of greatest accompt
among them, were thereby made vnable for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
but also wonderfully stricken with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in their guilty consciences, calling to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
how God had <hi>iustly</hi> punished them with
that same instrument, which they should haue
vsed for the effectuating of so great a sinne; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ould saying, <hi>In quo peccamus, in
eodem plectimur.</hi> Inasmuch as they presently
(see the wonderfull power of Gods iustice vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
guilty consciences) did all fall downe vpon
their knees praying God to pardon them for
their bloudy enterprise. And after that, giuing
ouer any further debate, opened the gate, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
the <hi>Sheriffes</hi> people to rush in furiously
among them, and desperately sought their owne
present destruction; The three specialls of them
ioyning backs together, <hi>Catesby, Percy,</hi> and <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:7927:117"/>
whereof two with one shot, <hi>Catesby</hi> and
<hi>Percy,</hi> were slaine, <hi>Winter</hi> was taken and saued
aliue.</p>
            <p>And thus these resolute and high-aspiring
<hi>Catholikes,</hi> who dreamed of no lesse then the
destruction of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>kingdomes,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to themselues no lower estate, then the
gouernment of great and ancient <hi>Monarchies,</hi>
were miserably defeated and quite ouerthrowne
in an instant, <hi>falling into the pit which they had
prepared for others;</hi> And so fulfilling that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
which his <hi>Maiestie</hi> did in a manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
of them, in his oration to the <hi>Parliament:</hi>
some presently slaine, others deadly wounded,
stripped of their cloathes, left lying miserably
naked, and so dying rather of cold, then of the
danger of their wounds; and the rest that either
were whole, or but lightly hurt, taken and led
prisoners by the <hi>Sheriffe,</hi> the <hi>ordinary Minister</hi>
of Iustice, to the Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l their sending vp to <hi>London,</hi> being met with
a huge confluence of people of all sorts, desirous
to see them, as the rarest sort of <hi>Monsters:</hi> fooles
to laugh at them, women and children to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
all the common people to gaze, the wiser
sort to satisfie their curiositie in seeing the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
cases of so vnheard-of a villany; and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
all sorts of people to satiate and fill their

they so farre admired and detested, seruing so
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:7927:118"/>
for a fearefull and publick spectacle of Gods
fierce wrath and iust indignation. They <hi>liued</hi>
blindely, they <hi>practisea</hi> diuellishly, they <hi>dyed</hi>
desperately; Their memory is <hi>cursed</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

            <p>Now what haue our aduersaries to say to

by the <hi>preaching</hi> of Gods word, by <hi>examples</hi> of

cannot be the <hi>Church</hi> of God? cannot pray to

inquire whether there be a change or no? and
then inquire further of the time and manner of
it. We say that which no man can deny, that
there is a notorious change: this is euident,
for the <hi>Church</hi> of old neuer allowed the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the impiety, the execrable wickednesse which

docere;</hi> that is, <hi>the Doctrine of the Prophets
and Apostles is called canonicall, because it is
the rule of our vnderstanding, and therefore no
man ought to teach otherwise.</hi> And in the second
place cited, he saith: <hi>Innititur fides nostra re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelationi
Apostolis &amp; Prophetis factae;</hi> that is,
<hi>our faith resteth vpon the reuelation made to the
Apos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>les and Prophets.</hi> Then, <hi>traditions</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
accounted the rule of our vnderstanding, or
that whereupon our faith must rest, though
the same be more fully pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ued out of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
themselues, and from a full consent of the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:7927:121"/>
ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> as is otherwhere manifested:
yet this I thought here might suffice to declare
the opinions of them that liued in the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> next before the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> as
many of these did, which I haue before named.
So that this is euident, the rule of faith was
neuer altered in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> before the
Councell of <hi>Trent.</hi> Then did they alter this
rule, by putting <hi>traditions</hi> of their <hi>Church</hi> into
the <hi>rule</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>Lucifer-like</hi> matching,
equalizing and mating the <hi>wisedome</hi> of God
with their owne <hi>follies.</hi> Then all is changed,
when the <hi>manners</hi> of the Church, the <hi>doctrines</hi>
of the Church, and the very <hi>rule</hi> of faith is
changed. What greater change may be looked
for hereafter in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> I
know not; but this is sufficient to moue vs to
forsake them as the congregation of the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>malignant.</hi> And because
they haue forsaken God and his truth, therefore
by the iust iudgement of God are they permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to runne into so many foule errors, and such
wicked and execrable practises, that neither
<hi>Christians</hi> nor <hi>heathen,</hi> guided onely by the
light of nature could euer approue. If they say,

our selues vnto another consideration, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>our</hi> religion with <hi>theirs, our</hi> practises with

selues in <hi>respect of them.</hi> Let our <hi>enemies</hi> be our
<hi>iudges.</hi> When euill is committed among vs, it
is punished, and therein we reioyce, that euill is
punished. It was neuer found that execrable
practises were approued by vs, for that were to
