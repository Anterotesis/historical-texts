            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PUBLISHER TO The Reader.</head>
            <p>THE Papers from which these <hi>Tracts</hi> were printed, were, a while since, deliver'd to me by, those worthy persons, the <hi>Lady</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> of the excellent Authour. He himself gave no charge concerning his <hi>Manuscripts,</hi> either for the suppressing or the publishing of them. Yet, seeing he had procured <hi>Transcripts</hi> of them, and had kept those <hi>Copies</hi> by him, it seemeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that He designed them for publick use.</p>
            <p>Thus much of his Intention being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, and many who had tasted of the fruits of his former studies being covetous of more of the like kind; Also these <hi>Tracts</hi> having been perused and much approv'd of by some Judicious and Learned men; <gap reason="illegible: broken" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:41958:3"/>
was not unwilling to be instrumental in fitting them for the Press.</p>
            <p>To this end, I selected them out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny disordred Papers, and dispos'd them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such a method as They seem'd capable of; beginning first with <hi>Plants,</hi> going on to <hi>Animals,</hi> proceeding farther to things relating to <hi>Men,</hi> and concluding with <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of a <hi>various nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Plants,</hi> I did, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, forbear to range them (as some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised) according to their <hi>Tribes</hi> and <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;</hi> because, by so doing, I should have represented that as a studied and formal work, which is but a Collection of <hi>occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Essaies.</hi> And, indeed, both this <hi>Tract,</hi> and those which follow, were rather the <hi>diversions</hi> than the <hi>Labours</hi> of his Pen: and, because He did, as it were, drop down his Thoughts of a sudden, in those little spaces of vacancy which he snatch'd from those very many occasions which gave him hourly interruption; If there appears, here and there, any uncorrectness in the style, a small degree of Candour sufficeth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse it.</p>
            <p>If there be any such errours in the words, I'm sure the Press has not made them fewer; but I do not hold my self oblig'd to answer for That which I could not perfectly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern. However, the matter is not of any
<pb facs="tcp:41958:3"/>
great moment: such errours will not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead a Learned Reader; and He who is not such in some competent degree, is not a fit Peruser of these LETTERS. Such these <hi>Tracts</hi> are; but, for the Persons to whom they were written, I cannot well learn their <hi>Names</hi> from those few obscure marks which the Authour has set at the beginning of them. And these Essaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Letters,</hi> as many as take offence at some few familiar things which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour hath mixed with them, find fault with decence. Men are not wont to set down Oracles in every line they write to their Acquaintance.</p>
            <p>There, still, remain other brief Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses written by this most Learned and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Authour. Those, also, may come forth, when some of his Friends shall have sufficient leisure; and at such due distance from these Tracts, that They may follow rather than stifle them.</p>
            <p>Amongst these Manuscripts there is one which gives a brief Account of all the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents</hi> of the <hi>Cathedral</hi> of <hi>Norwich.</hi> It was written merely for private use: and the Relations of the Authour expect such Justice from those into whose hands some imperfect Copies of it are fallen; that, without their Consent first obtain'd, they forbear the publishing of It.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:41958:4"/>
The truth is, matter equal to the skill of the Antiquary was not, there, afforded: had a fit Subject of that nature offer'd it self, He would scarce have been guilty of an oversight like to that of <hi>Ausonius,</hi> who, in the description of his native City of <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> omitted the two famous Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of it, <hi>Palais de Tutele,</hi> and, <hi>Palais de Galien.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Authour himself,</hi> I chuse to be silent, though I have had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to have been, for some years, known to him. There is on foot a design of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his <hi>Life:</hi> and there are, already, some Memorials collected by one of his ancient Friends. Till that work be perfected, the Reader may content himself with these present <hi>Tracts;</hi> all which commending themselves by their <hi>Learning, Curiosity</hi> and <hi>Brevity,</hi> if He be not pleased with them, he seemeth to me to be distemper'd with such a niceness of Imagination as no wise man is concern'd to humour.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough many ordinary Heads run <note place="margin">The Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</note> smoothly over the Scripture, yet I must acknowledge, it is one of the hardest Books I have met with: and therefore well deserveth those numerous Comments, Expositions and Annotations
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41958:6"/>
which make up a good part of our Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>However so affected I am therewith, that I wish there had been more of it: and a larger Volume of that Divine Piece which leaveth such welcome impressions, and somewhat more, in the Readers, than the words and sense after it. At least, who would not be glad that many things bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinted were at large delivered in it? The particulars of the Dispute between the Doctours and our Saviour could not but be welcome to them, who have every word in honour which proceeded from his mouth, or was otherwise delivered by him: and so would be glad to be assured, what he wrote with his Finger on the ground: But especially to have a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of that instructing Narration or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course which he made unto the Disciples after his resurrection, where 'tis said: <hi>And</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luke 24 27.</note> 
               <hi>beginning at Moses, and all the Prophets, he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to omit Theological obscurities, you must needs observe that most Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do seem to have something more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to consider in the expressions of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Astronomers find therein the Names but of few Stars, scarce so many as in <hi>Achilles</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:41958:6"/>
his <hi>Buckler</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> and almost the very same. But in some passages of the Old Testament they think they discover the Zodiacal course of the Sun: and they, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, conceive an Astronomical sense in that elegant expression of S. <hi>James</hi> concerning <hi>the father of lights, with whom there is no</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 17.</note> 
               <hi>variableness, neither shadow of turning:</hi> and therein an allowable allusion unto the tropical conversion of the Sun, whereby ensueth a variation of heat, light, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of shadows from it. But whether the <hi>Stellae erraticae,</hi> or wandring Stars in S. <hi>Jude,</hi> may be referr'd to the celestial Planets, or some metereological wandring Stars, <hi>Ignes fatui, Stellae cadentes &amp; er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raticae,</hi> or had any allusion unto the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postour <hi>Barchochebas,</hi> or <hi>Stellae Filius,</hi> who afterward appeared, and wandred about in the time of <hi>Adrianus,</hi> they leave unto conjecture.</p>
            <p>Chirurgions may find their whole Art in that one passage, concerning the Rib which God took out of <hi>Adam,</hi> that is their <gap reason="foreign">

acknowledge a very nutritive and impin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guating faculty in Pulses, in leguminous Food, and in several sorts of Grains and Corns, is not like to be doubted by such who consider that this was probably a great part of the Food of our Forefathers before the Floud, the Diet also of <hi>Jacob:</hi> and that the Romans (called therefore <hi>Pultifagi)</hi> fed much on Pulse for six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years; that they had no Bakers for that time: and their Pistours were such as, before the use of Mills, beat out and cleansed their Corn. As also that the Ath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letick Diet was of Pulse, <hi>Alphiton, Maza,</hi> Barley and Water; whereby they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged sometimes to an exquisite state of health, and such as was not without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And therefore (though <hi>Daniel</hi> were no Eunuch, and of a more fatning and thriving temper, as some have phancied, yet) was he by this kind of Diet, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently maintained in a fair and carnous state of Body, and accordingly his Picture not improperly drawn, that is, not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre and lean, like <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s, but plump and fair, answerable to the most authentick draught of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and the late Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Luther</hi>'s Bible.</p>

            <p>That it might be <hi>Melanthium, Nigella,</hi> or Gith, may be allowably apprehended, from the frequent use of the Seed thereof among the Jews and other Nations, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so from the Translation of <hi>Tremellius;</hi> and the Original implying a black Seed, which is less than Cummin, as, out of

            <p>That we meet so often with Cummin Seed in many parts of Scripture in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto <hi>Judaea,</hi> a Seed so abominable at present unto our Palates and Nostrils, will not seem strange unto any who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the frequent use thereof among the Ancients, not onely in medical but diete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical use and practice: For their Dishes were filled therewith, and the noblest fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stival preparations in <hi>Apicius</hi> were not without it: And even in the <hi>Polenta,</hi> and parched Corn, the old Diet of the Romans, (as <hi>Pliny</hi> recordeth) unto every Measure they mixed a small proportion of Lin-seed and Cummin-seed.</p>
            <p>And so Cummin is justly set down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong things of vulgar and common use, when it is said in <hi>Matthew</hi> 23. v. 23. <hi>You pay Tithe of Mint, Annise and Cummin:</hi> but how to make out the translation of Annise we are still to seek, there being no word in that Text which properly signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Annise: the Original being <gap reason="foreign">

That among many expressions, allusions and illustrations made in Scripture from Corns, there is no mention made of Oats, so usefull a Grain among us, will not seem very strange unto you, till you can clearly discover that it was a Grain of ordinary use in those parts; who may also find that <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> who is large about other Grains, delivers very little of it. That <hi>Dioscorides</hi> is also very short therein. And <hi>Galen</hi> delivers that it was of some use in <hi>Asia minor,</hi> especially in <hi>Mysia,</hi> and that rather for Beasts than Men: And <hi>Pliny</hi> affirmeth that the <hi>Pulticula</hi> thereof was most in use among the Germans. Yet that the Jews were not without all use of this Grain seems confirmable from the Rabbinical account, who reckon five Grains liable unto their Offerings, whereof the Cake presented might be made; that is, Wheat, Oats, Rye, and two sorts of Barley.</p>

            <p>How properly the priority was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a Rod or Staff, and why the Rods and Staffs of the Princes were chosen for this decision, Philologists will consider. For these were the badges, signs and cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisances of their places, and were a kind of Sceptre in their hands, denoting their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminencies. The Staff of Divinity is ordinarily described in the hands of Gods and Goddesses in old draughts. Trojan and Grecian Princes were not without the like, whereof the Shoulders of <hi>Thersites</hi> felt from the hands of <hi>Ulysses. Achilles</hi> in <hi>Homer,</hi> as by a desperate Oath, swears by his wooden Sceptre, which should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bud nor bear Leaves again; which seeming the greatest impossibility to him,

advanceth the Miracle of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod: And if it could be well made out that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> had seen the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> in that expression of <hi>Achilles,</hi> he might allude un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Miracle.</p>
            <p>That power which proposed the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment by Blossomes in the Rod, added also the Fruit of Almonds; the Text not strictly making out the Leaves, and so omitting the middle germination: the Leaves properly coming after the Flowers, and before the Almonds. And therefore if you have well perused Medals, you cannot but observe how in the impress of many Shekels, which pass among us by the name of the <hi>Jerusalem</hi> Shekels, the Rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> is improperly laden with many Leaves, whereas that which is shewn under the name of the Samaritan Shekel seems most conformable unto the Text, which descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the Fruit without Leaves.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41958:25"/>
Numbers may apprehend, I pretend not to determine.</p>
            <p>But, how this multiplication may well be conceived, and in what way apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and that this centessimal increase is not naturally strange, you that are no stranger in Agriculture, old and new, are not like to make great doubt.</p>
            <p>That every Grain should produce an Ear affording an hundred Grains, is not like to be their conjecture who behold the growth of Corn in our Fields, wherein a common Grain doth produce far less in number. For Barley consisting but of two <hi>Versus</hi> or Rows, seldom exceedeth twenty Grains, that is, ten upon each <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Row; Rye, of a square figure, is very fruitfull at forty: Wheat, besides the <hi>Frit</hi> and <hi>Uruncus,</hi> or imperfect Grains of the small Husks at the top and bottom of the Ear, is fruitfull at ten treble <hi>Glumoe</hi> or Husks in a Row, each containing but three Grains in breadth, if the middle Grain arriveth at all to perfection; and so maketh up threescore Grains in both sides.</p>
            <p>Yet even this centessimal fructification may be admitted in some sorts of <hi>Cerea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> and Grains from one Ear: if we take in the <hi>Triticum centigranum,</hi> or <hi>fertilissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Plinii,</hi> Indian Wheat, and <hi>Panicum;</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:41958:25"/>
which, in every Ear, containeth hundreds of Grains.</p>
            <p>But this increase may easily be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of Grains in their total multiplication, in good and fertile ground, since, if every Grain of Wheat produceth but three Ears, the increase will arise above that number. Nor are we without examples of some grounds which have produced many more Ears, and above this centessimal increase: As <hi>Pliny</hi> hath left recorded of the <hi>Byza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Field in <hi>Africa. Misit ex eo loco Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator ex uno quadraginta minus germina. Misit &amp; Neroni pariter tercentum quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginta stipulos, ex uno grano. Cum centes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simos quidem Leontini Sicilioe campi fundunt, aliique, &amp; tota Boetica, &amp; imprimis Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptus.</hi> And even in our own Country, from one Grain of Wheat sowed in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, I have numbred many more than an hundred.</p>
            <p>And though many Grains are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lost which come not to sprouting or earing, yet the same is also verified in measure; as that one Bushel should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a hundred, as is exemplified by the Corn in <hi>Gerar;</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 26. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Then Isaac sowed in that Land, and received in that year an hundred fold.</hi> That is, as the Chaldee explaineth it, <hi>a hundred for one,</hi> when he measured it. And this <hi>Pliny</hi> seems to intend, when he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41958:26"/>
saith of the fertile Byzacian Territory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, <hi>Ex uno centeni quinqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginta modii redduntur.</hi> And may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably apprehended of the fertility of some grounds in <hi>Poland;</hi> wherein, after the account of <hi>Gaguinus,</hi> from Rye sowed in <hi>August,</hi> come thirty or forty Ears, and a Man on Horseback can scarce look over it. In the Sabbatical Crop of <hi>Judoea,</hi> there must be admitted a large increase, and probably not short of this centessimal mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication: For it supplied part of the sixth year, the whole seventh, and eighth untill the Harvest of that year.</p>
            <p>The <hi>seven years of plenty in Aegypt</hi> must be of high increase; when, by sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up but the fifth part, they supplied the whole Land, and many of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours after: for it is said, <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 41. 56.</note> the Famine was in all the Land about them. And therefore though the causes of the Dearth in <hi>Aegypt</hi> be made out from the defect of the overflow of <hi>Nilus,</hi> according to the Dream of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> yet was that no cause of the scarcity in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which may rather be ascribed to the want of the former and latter rains, for some succeeding years, if their Famine held time and duration with that of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> as may be probably gather'd from that expression of <hi>Joseph,</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 45. 9, 11.</note> 
               <hi>Come down unto me</hi>

            </p>
            <p>How they preserved their Corn so long in <hi>Aegypt</hi> may seem hard unto Northern and moist Climates, except we consider the many ways of preservation practised by antiquity, and also take in that handsome account of <hi>Pliny;</hi> What Corn soever is laid up in the Ear, it taketh no harm keep it as long as you will; although the best and most assured way to keep Corn is in Caves and Vaults under ground, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the practice of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> and <hi>Thracia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Mauritania</hi> above all things they look to this, that their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries stand on high ground; and how drie so ever their Floor be, they lay a course of Chaff betwixt it and the ground. Besides, they put up their Corn in Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries and Binns together with the Ear. And <hi>Varro</hi> delivereth that Wheat laid up in that manner will last fifty years; Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let an hundred; and Beans so conserved in a Cave of <hi>Ambracia,</hi> were known to last an hundred and twenty years; that is, from the time of King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> unto the Pyratick War under the conduct of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey.</hi>

More strange it may seem how, after seven years, the Grains conserved should be fruitfull for a new production.

            <p>That the Balsam Plant hath grown and prospered in <hi>Judaea</hi> we believe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dispute. For the same is attested by <hi>Theophrastus, Pliny, Justinus,</hi> and many more; from the commendation that <hi>Galen</hi> affordeth of the Balsam of <hi>Syria,</hi> and the story of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> that she obtain'd some Plants of Balsam from <hi>Herod</hi> the Great to transplant into <hi>Aegypt.</hi> But whether it was so anciently in <hi>Judaea</hi> as the time of <hi>Jacob;</hi> nay, whether this Plant was here before the time of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that great collectour of Vegetable rarities, some doubt may be made from the account of <hi>Jose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> that the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> a part of <hi>Arabia,</hi> among presents unto <hi>Solomon,</hi> brought some Plants of the Balsam Tree, as one of the peculiar estimables of her Country.</p>

Whether this ever had its natural growth, or were an original native Plant of <hi>Judaea,</hi> much more that it was peculiar unto that Country, a greater doubt may arise: while we reade in <hi>Pausanias, Strabo</hi> and <hi>Diodorus,</hi> that it grows also in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and find in <note n="*" place="margin">Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrast. <hi>l.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 6.</note> 
               <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> that it grew in two Gardens about <hi>Jericho</hi> in <hi>Judaea.</hi> And more especially whiles we seriously consider that notable discourse between <hi>Abdella, Abdachim</hi> and <hi>Alpinus,</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the natural and original place of this singular Plant to be in <hi>Arabia,</hi> about <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> and <hi>Medina,</hi> where it still plentifully groweth, and Mountains abound therein. From whence it hath been carefully trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted by the <hi>Basha's</hi> of <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> into the Garden of <hi>Matarea;</hi> where, when it dies, it is repaired again from those parts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> from whence the <hi>Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi> yearly receiveth a present of Balsam from the <hi>Xeriff</hi> of <hi>Mecha,</hi> still called by the Arabians <hi>Balessan;</hi> whence they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve arose the Greek appellation <hi>Balsam.</hi> And since these Balsam-plants are not now to be found in <hi>Judaea,</hi> and though purposely cultivated, are often lost in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea,</hi> but everlastingly live, and naturally renew in <hi>Arabia;</hi> They probably conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that those of <hi>Judaea</hi> were foreign and transplanted from these parts.</p>

All which notwithstanding, since the same Plant may grow naturally and spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneously in several Countries, and either from inward or outward causes be lost in one Region, while it continueth and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in another, the Balsam Tree might possibly be a native of <hi>Judaea</hi> as well as of <hi>Arabia;</hi> which because <hi>de facto</hi> it cannot be clearly made out, the ancient expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Scripture become doubtfull in this point.

               <hi>But the Wheat and the Rye were not smitten, for they were not grown up.</hi> The Original signifies that it was <hi>hidden,</hi> or <hi>dark,</hi> the Vulgar and Septuagint that it was <hi>serotinous</hi> or <hi>late,</hi> and our old Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that it was <hi>late sown.</hi> And so the expression and interposition of <hi>Moses,</hi> who well understood the Husbandry of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> might Emphatically declare the state of Wheat and Rye in that particular year; and if so, the same is solvable from the time of the floud of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of its inundation. For if it were very high, and over-drenching the ground, they were forced to later Seed-time; and so the Wheat and the Rye escaped; for they were more slowly growing Grains, and, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the greater inundation of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, were sown later than ordinary that year, especially in the Plains near the

            <p>The <hi>turning of the River into Bloud</hi> shews in what Month this happened not.

            <p>How this should be fitly expressed by the word <hi>Tolagnoth, Vermis,</hi> or <hi>Worm,</hi> may be made out from <hi>Pliny,</hi> who calls it <hi>Coccus Scolecius,</hi> or the <hi>Wormy Berry;</hi> as also from the name of that Colour cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Vermilion;</hi> or the <hi>Worm Colour;</hi> and which is also answerable unto the true nature of it.

            <p>And this division into Herb and Tree, may also suffice, if we take in that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ground of the division of perfect Plants, and such as grow from Seeds.

            <p>And, first, for the better comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all deductions hereupon, we may consider the several differences and distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both of Figg Trees and their Fruits. <hi>Suidas</hi> upon the word <gap reason="foreign">

and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But because <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> makes no considerable distinction, learned men do chiefly insist upon the three others; that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Grossus,</hi> which are the Buttons, or small sort of Figgs, either not ripe, or not ordinarily proceeding to ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but fall away at least in the greatest part, and especially in sharp Winters; which are also named <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from the Fruit of the wild Figg, or <hi>Caprificus,</hi> which is named <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and never cometh unto ripeness. The second is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Ficus,</hi> which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceedeth unto ripeness in its due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. A third the ripe Figg dried, which maketh the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Carrier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of Figg Trees there are also many divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; For some are <hi>prodromi,</hi> or precoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which bear Fruit very early, whether they bear once, or oftner in the year; some are <hi>protericae,</hi> which are the most early of the precocious Trees, and bear soonest of any; some are <hi>aestivae,</hi> which bear in the common season of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and some <hi>serotinae</hi> which bear very late.</p>
            <p>Some are <hi>biferous</hi> and <hi>triferous,</hi> which bear twice or thrice in the year, and some are of the ordinary standing course, which make up the expected season of Figgs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:41958:40"/>
Again some Figg Trees, either in their proper kind, or fertility in some single ones, do bear Fruit or rudiments of Fruit all the year long; as is annually observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in some kind of Figg Trees in hot and proper regions; and may also be observed in some Figg Trees of more temperate Countries, in years of no great disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, wherein, when the Summer-ripe Figg is past, others begin to appear, and so, standing in Buttons all the Winter, do either fall away before the Spring, or else proceed to ripeness.</p>
            <p>Now, according to these distinctions, we may measure the intent of the Text, and endeavour to make out the expression. For, considering the diversity of these Trees, and their several fructifications, probable or possible it is, that some there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were implied, and may literally afford a solution.</p>
            <p>And first, though it was not the season for Figgs, yet some Fruit might have been expected, even in ordinary bearing Trees. For the <hi>Grossi</hi> or Buttons appear before the Leaves, especially before the Leaves are well grown. Some might have stood du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Winter, and by this time been of some growth: Though many fall off, yet some might remain on, and proceed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards maturity. And we find that good
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41958:41"/>
Husbands had an art to make them hold on, as is delivered by <hi>Theophrastus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or common Summer Figg was not expected; for that is placed by <hi>Galen</hi> among the <hi>Fructus Horarii,</hi> or <hi>Horaei,</hi> which ripen in that part of Summer, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and stands commended by him above other Fruits of that season. And of this kind might be the Figgs which were brought unto <hi>Cleopatra</hi> in a Basket toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with an Asp, according to the time of her death on the nineteenth of <hi>August.</hi> And that our Saviour expected not such Figgs, but some other kind, seems to be implied in the indefinite expression, <hi>if hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he might find any thing thereon;</hi> which in that Country, and the variety of such Trees, might not be despaired of, at this season, and very probably hoped for in the first precocious and early bearing Trees. And that there were precocious and early bearing Trees in <hi>Judaea,</hi> may be illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from some expressions in Scripture concerning precocious Figgs; <note n="*" place="margin">Jer. 24. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Calathus unus habebat Ficus bonas nimis, sicut solent esse Ficus primi temporis; One Basket had very good Figgs, even like the Figgs that are first ripe.</hi> And the like might be more especially expected in this place, if this remarkable Tree be rightly placed in some Mapps of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> for it is placed, by
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41958:41"/>
               <hi>Adrichomius,</hi> in or near <hi>Bethphage,</hi> which some conjectures will have to be the <hi>House of Figgs:</hi> and at this place Figg Trees are still to be found, if we consult the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels of <hi>Bidulphus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, in this great variety of Figg Trees, as precocious, proterical, biferous, triferous, and always bearing Trees, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might have been expected, though the time of common Figgs was not yet. For some Trees bear in a manner all the year; as may be illustrated from the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of the Emperour <hi>Julian,</hi> concerning his Present of <hi>Damascus</hi> Figgs, which he commendeth from their successive and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued growing and bearing, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Fruits which <hi>Homer</hi> describeth in the Garden of <hi>Alcinous.</hi> And though it were then but about the eleventh of <hi>March,</hi> yet, in the Latitude of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the Sun at that time hath a good power in the day, and might advance the matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of precocious often-bearing or ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing Figgs. And therefore when it is said <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> Mark 14. 67. <hi>S.</hi> Luke 22. 55, 56.</note> that <hi>S. Peter</hi> stood and warmed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by the Fire in the Judgment Hall, and the reason is added [<note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>S.</hi> John 18. 18.</note> 
               <hi>for it was cold]</hi> that expression might be interposed either to denote the coolness in the Morning, according to hot Countries, or some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and unusual coldness, which
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41958:42"/>
happened at that time. For the same <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulphus,</hi> who was at that time of the year at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> saith, that it was then as hot as at <hi>Midsummer</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> and we find in Scripture, that the first Sheaf of Barley was offer'd in <hi>March.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Saviour therefore, seeing a Figg Tree with Leaves well spread, and so as to be distinguished a far off, went unto it, and when he came, found nothing but Leaves; he found it to be no precocious, or always-bearing Tree: And though it were not the time for Summer Figgs, yet he found no rudiments thereof; and though he expected not common Figgs, yet something might happily have been expected of some other kind, according to different fertility, and variety of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; but, discovering nothing, he found a Tree answering the State of the Jewish Rulers, barren unto all expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And this is consonant unto the mystery of the Story, wherein the Figg Tree de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noteth the Synagogue and Rulers of the Jews, whom God having peculiarly cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, singularly blessed and cherished, he expected from them no ordinary, slow, or customary fructification, but an earli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in good Works, a precocious or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued fructification, and was not content
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41958:42"/>
with common after-bearing; and might justly have expostulated with the Jews, as God by the Prophet <note n="*" place="margin">Micah 7. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Micah</hi> did with their Forefathers; <hi>Praecoquas Ficus desideravit Anima mea, My Soul longed for,</hi> (or desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) <hi>early ripe Fruits, but ye are become as a Vine already gathered, and there is no cluster upon you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, In this account of the Figg Tree, the mystery and symbolical sense is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be looked upon. Our Saviour, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, taking a hint from his hunger to go unto this specious Tree, and intending, by this Tree, to declare a Judgment upon the Synagogue and people of the Jews, he came unto the Tree, and, after the usual manner, inquired, and looked about for some kind of Fruit, as he had done before in the Jews, but found nothing but Leaves and specious outsides, as he had also found in them; and when it bore no Fruit like them, when he expected it, and came to look for it, though it were not the time of ordinary Fruit, yet failing when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it, in the mysterious sense, 'twas fruitless longer to expect it. For he had come unto them, and they were nothing fructified by it, his departure approached, and his time of preaching was now at an end.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:41958:43"/>
Now, in this account, besides the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, some things are naturally conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. For it may be question'd how the Figg Tree, naturally a fruitfull Plant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came barren, for it had no shew or so much as rudiment of Fruit: And it was, in old time, a signal Judgment of God, that <hi>the Figg Tree should bear no Fruit:</hi> and therefore this Tree may naturally be conceived to have been under some Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease indisposing it to such fructification. And this, in the Pathology of Plants, may be the Disease of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or superfoliation mention'd by <hi>Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus;</hi> whereby the fructifying Juice is star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the excess of Leaves; which in this Tree were already so full spread, that it might be known and distinguished a far off. And this was, also, a sharp resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the hypocrisie of the Rulers, made up of specious outsides, and fruitless ostentation, contrary to the Fruit of the Figg Tree, which, filled with a sweet and pleasant pulp, makes no shew without, not so much as of any Flower.</p>
            <p>Some naturals are also considerable from the propriety of this punishment settled upon a Figg Tree: For infertility and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness seems more intolerable in this Tree than any, as being a Vegetable sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly constituted for production; so far
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41958:43"/>
from bearing no Fruit that it may be made to bear almost any. And therefore the Ancients singled out this as the fittest Tree whereon to graft and propagate other Fruits, as containing a plentifull and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sap, whereby other Cyons would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper: And, therefore, this Tree was also sacred unto the Deity of Fertility: and the <hi>Statua</hi> of <hi>Priapus</hi> was made of the Figg Tree.</p>
            <l>Olim Truncus eram Ficulnus inutile lignum. <note place="margin">M.</note>
            </l>
            <p>It hath also a peculiar advantage to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and maintain its Fruit above all other Plants, as not subject to miscarry in Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Blossomes, from accidents of Wind and Weather. For it beareth no Flowers outwardly, and such as it hath, are within the Coat, as the later examination of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalists hath discovered.</p>
            <p>Lastly, It was a Tree wholly constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Fruit, wherein if it faileth, it is in a manner useless, the Wood thereof being of so little use, that it affordeth proverbial expressions,</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zizania, in S.</hi> Matt. 13. 24, 25, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>unto a man which sowed good Seed in his Field, but while men slept, his Enemy came and sowed Tares</hi> (or, as the Greek, <hi>Zizania) among the Wheat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, how to render <hi>Zizania,</hi> and to what species of Plants to confine it, there is no slender doubt; for the word is not mention'd in other parts of Scripture, nor in any ancient Greek Writer: it is not to be found in <hi>Aristotle, Theophrastus,</hi> or <hi>Dioscorides.</hi> Some Greek and Latin Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have made use of the same, as also <hi>Suidas</hi> and <hi>Phavorinus;</hi> but probably they have all derived it from this Text.</p>
            <p>And therefore this obscurity might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily occasion such variety in Translations and Expositions. For some retain the word <hi>Zizania,</hi> as the Vulgar, that of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> of <hi>Junius,</hi> and also the Italian and Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish. The Low Dutch renders it <hi>Oncruidt,</hi> the German <hi>Oncraut,</hi> or <hi>Herba Mala,</hi> the French <hi>Yuroye</hi> or <hi>Lolium,</hi> and the English <hi>Tares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, this being conceived to be a Syriack word, it may still add unto the uncertainty of the sense. For though this Gospel were first written in Hebrew, or Syriack, yet it is not unquestionable whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the true Original be any where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant: And that Syriack Copy which we
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41958:47"/>
now have, is conceived to be of far later time than S. <hi>Matthew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Expositours and Annotatours are also various. <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> hath passed the word <hi>Zizania</hi> without a Note. <hi>Diodati,</hi> retaining the word <hi>Zizania,</hi> conceives that it was some peculiar Herb growing among the Corn of those Countries, and not known in our Fields. But <hi>Emanuel de Sa</hi> interprets it, <hi>Plantas semini noxias,</hi> and so accordingly some others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Buxtorfius,</hi> in his Rabbinical Lexicon, gives divers interpretations, sometimes for degenerated Corn, sometimes for the black Seeds in Wheat, but withall concludes, <hi>an hoec sit eadem vox aut species, cum Ziza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niâ apud Evangelistam, quoerant alii.</hi> But Lexicons and Dictionaries by <hi>Zizania</hi> do almost generally understand <hi>Lolium,</hi> which we call <hi>Darnel,</hi> and commonly confine the signification to that Plant: Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, since <hi>Lolium</hi> had a known and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Name in Greek, some may be apt to doubt, why, if that Plant were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly intended, the proper Greek word was not used in the Text. For <note n="*" place="margin">

               </gap>, and hath often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned that Plant; and in one place saith that Corn doth sometimes <hi>Loliescere</hi> or degenerate into <hi>Darnel. Dioscorides,</hi> who travelled over <hi>Judoea,</hi> gives it the same
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41958:48"/>
name, which is also to be found in <hi>Galen, Aetius</hi> and <hi>Aegineta;</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times latinized that word into <hi>Aera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, <hi>Lolium</hi> or Darnel shews it self in the Winter, growing up with the Wheat; and <hi>Theophrastus</hi> observed that it was no Vernal Plant, but came up in the Winter; which will not well answer the expression of the Text, <hi>And when the Blade came up, and brought forth Fruit,</hi> or gave evidence of its Fruit, <hi>the Zizania</hi> appeared. And if the Husbandry of the Ancients were agreeable unto ours, they would not have been so earnest to weed away the Darnel; for our Husbandmen do not commonly weed it in the Field, but separate the Seeds after Thrashing. And therefore <hi>Galen</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth, that in an unseasonable year, and great scarcity of Corn, when they neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to separate the Darnel, the Bread pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved generally unwholsome, and had evil effects on the Head.</p>
            <p>Our old and later Translation render <hi>Zizania, Tares,</hi> which name our English Botanists give unto <hi>Aracus, Cracca, Vicia sylvestris,</hi> calling them Tares, and stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling Tares. And our Husbandmen by Tares understand some sorts of wild Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which grow amongst Corn, and clasp upon it, according to the Latin Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology, <hi>Vicia à Vinciendo.</hi> Now in this
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41958:48"/>
uncertainty of the Original, Tares as well as some others, may make out the sense, and be also more agreeable unto the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of the Parable. For they come up and appear what they are, when the Blade of the Corn is come up, and also the Stalk and Fruit discoverable. They have likewise little spreading Roots, which may intangle or rob the good Roots, and they have also tendrils and claspers, which lay hold of what grows near them, and so can hardly be weeded without endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the neighbour Corn.</p>
            <p>However, if by <hi>Zizania</hi> we understand <hi>Herbas segeti noxias,</hi> or <hi>vitia segetum,</hi> as some Expositours have done, and take the word in a more general sense, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding several Weeds and Vegetables offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive unto Corn, according as the Greek word in the plural Number may imply, and as the learned <note n="*" place="margin">De Horti cultura.</note> 
               <hi>Laurenbergius</hi> hath expressed, <hi>Runcare quod apud nostrates We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den dicitur, Zizanias inutiles est evellere.</hi> If, I say, it be thus taken, we shall not need to be definitive, or confine unto one particular Plant, from a word which may comprehend divers: And this may also prove a safer sense, in such obscurity of the Original.</p>
            <p>And therefore since in this Parable the sower of the <hi>Zizania</hi> is the Devil, and the

               <hi>Zizania</hi> wicked persons; if any from this larger acception, will take in Thistles, Darnel, Cockle, wild strangling Fitches, Bindweed, <hi>Tribulus,</hi> Restharrow and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Vitia Segetum;</hi> he may, both from the natural and symbolical qualities of those Vegetables, have plenty of matter to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the variety of his mischiefs, and of the wicked of this world.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE use of flowry Crowns and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands is of no slender Antiquity, and higher than I conceive you apprehend it. For, besides the old Greeks and Romans, the Aegyptians made use hereof; who, beside the bravery of their Garlands, had little Birds upon them to peck their Heads and Brows, and so to keep them sleeping at their Festival com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potations. This practice also extended as far as <hi>India:</hi> for at the Feast with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41958:50"/>
King, it is peculiarly observed by <hi>Philostratus</hi> that their custom was to wear Garlands, and come crowned with them unto their Feast.</p>
            <p>The Crowns and Garlands of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents were either Gestatory, such as they wore about their Heads or Necks; Porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, such as they carried at solemn Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals; Pensile or Suspensory, such as they hanged about the Posts of their Houses in honour of their Gods, as of <hi>Jupiter Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roeus</hi> or <hi>Limeneus;</hi> or else they were De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pository, such as they laid upon the Graves and Monuments of the dead. And these were made up after all ways of Art, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactile, Sutile, Plectile; for which Work there were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or expert Persons to contrive them after the best grace and property.</p>
            <p>Though we yield not unto them in the beauty of flowry Garlands, yet some of those of Antiquity were larger than any we lately meet with: for we find in <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeus</hi> that a Myrtle Crown of one and twenty foot in compass was solemnly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about at the Hellotian Feast in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> together with the Bones of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Garlands were surely of frequent use among them; for we reade in <note n="*" place="margin">De Theria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca ad Piso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</note> 
               <hi>Galen</hi> that when <hi>Hippocrates</hi> cured the great
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41958:50"/>
Plague of <hi>Athens</hi> by Fires kindled in and about the City; the fuel thereof consisted much of their Garlands. And they must needs be very frequent and of common use, the ends thereof being many. For they were convivial, festival, sacrificial, nuptial, honorary, funebrial. We who propose unto our selves the pleasure of two Senses, and onely single out such as are of Beauty and good Odour, cannot strictly confine our selves unto imitation of them.</p>
            <p>For, in their convivial Garlands, they had respect unto Plants preventing drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness, or discussing the exhalations from Wine; wherein, beside Roses, taking in Ivy, Vervain, Melilote, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they made use of divers of small Beauty or good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. The solemn festival Garlands were made properly unto their Gods, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly contrived from Plants sacred unto such Deities; and their sacrificial ones were selected under such considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Their honorary Crowns trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal, ovary, civical, obsidional, had little of Flowers in them: and their funebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Garlands had little of beauty in them beside Roses, while they made them of Myrtle, Rosemary, Apium, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under symbolical intimations: but our florid and purely ornamental Garlands, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41958:51"/>
unto sight and smell, nor framed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to mystical and symbolical consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, are of more free election, and so may be made to excell those of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients; we having <hi>China, India,</hi> and a new world to supply us, beside the great distinction of Flowers unknown unto An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and the varieties thereof arising from Art and Nature.</p>
            <p>But, beside Vernal, Aestival and Autum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal made of Flowers, the Ancients had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Hyemal Garlands; contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at first with such as were made of Horn died into several Colours, and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into the Figures of Flowers, and also of <hi>Aes Coronarium</hi> or <hi>Clincquant</hi> or Brass thinly wrought out into Leaves common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known among us. But the curiosity of some Emperours for such intents had Roses brought from <hi>Aegypt</hi> untill they had found the art to produce late Roses in <hi>Rome,</hi> and to make them grow in the Winter, as is delivered in that handsome Epigramme of <hi>Martial,</hi>
            </p>
            <l>At tu Romanae jussus jam cedere Brumae</l>
            <l>Mitte tuas messes, Accipe, Nile, Rosas.</l>
            <p>Some American Nations, who do much excell in Garlands, content not themselves onely with Flowers, but make elegant
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41958:51"/>
Crowns of Feathers, whereof they have some of greater radiancy and lustre than their Flowers: and since there is an Art to set into shapes, and curiously to work in choicest Feathers, there could nothing answer the Crowns made of the choicest Feathers of some <hi>Tomineios</hi> and Sun Birds.</p>
            <p>The Catalogue of Coronary Plants is not large in <hi>Theophrastus, Pliny, Pollux,</hi> or <hi>Athenaeus:</hi> but we may find a good enlargement in the accounts of Modern Botanists; and additions may still be made by successive acquists of fair and specious Plants, not yet translated from foreign Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions or little known unto our Gardens; he that would be complete may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of these following,</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have thought, a little, upon the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion proposed by you [viz. <hi>What kind of Fishes those were of which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ate with his Disciples after his</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">S. Joh. 21. 9, 10, 11, 13.</note> 
               <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection?]</hi> and I return you such an Answer,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41958:54"/>
as, in so short a time for study, and in the midst of my occasions, occurs to me.</p>
            <p>The Books of Scripture (as also those which are Apocryphal) are often silent, or very sparing, in the particular Names of Fishes; or in setting them down in such manner as to leave the kinds of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt and reason for farther inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For, when it declareth what Fishes were allowed the Israelites for their Food, they are onely set down in general which have Finns and Scales; whereas, in the account of <hi>Quadrupeds</hi> and Birds, there is particular mention made of divers of them. In the Book of <hi>Tobit</hi> that Fish which he took out of the River is onely named a great Fish, and so there remains much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty to determine the Species thereof. And even the Fish which swallowed <hi>Jonah,</hi> and is called a <hi>great Fish,</hi> and commonly thought to be a great Whale, is not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without all doubt; while some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men conceive it to have been none of our Whales, but a large kind of <hi>Lamia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, in this narration of S. <hi>John,</hi> the Fishes are onely expressed by their Bigness and Number, not their Names, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may seem undeterminable what they were: notwithstanding, these Fishes being taken in the great Lake or Sea of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> something may be probably sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41958:54"/>
therein. For since <hi>Bellonius,</hi> that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and learned Traveller, informeth us, that the Fishes of this Lake were Trouts, Pikes, Chevins and Tenches; it may well be conceived that either all or some there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are to be understood in this Scripture. And these kind of Fishes become large and of great growth, answerable unto the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of Scripture, <hi>One hundred and three great Fishes;</hi> that is, large in their own kinds, and the largest kinds in this Lake and fresh Water, wherein no great varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and of the larger sort of Fishes, could be expected. For the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through this Lake, falls into the Lake of <hi>Asphaltus,</hi> and hath no mouth into the Sea, which might admit of great Fishes or greater variety to come up into it.</p>
            <p>And out of the mouth of some of these forementioned Fishes might the <hi>Tribute money</hi> be taken, when our Saviour, at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum,</hi> seated upon the same Lake, said unto <hi>Peter, Go thou to the Sea, and cast an Hook, and take up the Fish that first co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth; and when thou hast opened his mouth thou shalt find a piece of money; that take and give them for thee and me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this makes void that common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and tradition of the Fish called <hi>Faber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marinus,</hi> by some, a <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Penny Fish;</hi> which having two remarkable round spots

upon either side, these are conceived to be the marks of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Fingers or signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Money: for though it hath these marks, yet is there no probability that such a kind of Fish was to be found in the Lake of <hi>Tiberias, Geneserah</hi> or <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee,</hi> which is but sixteen miles long and six broad, and hath no communication with the Sea; for this is a mere Fish of the Sea and salt Water, and (though we meet with some thereof on our Coast) is not to be found in many Seas.</p>
            <p>Thus having returned no improbable Answer unto your Question, I shall crave leave to ask another of your self concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that Fish mention'd by <note n="*" place="margin">De Bello Gothico, lib. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Procopius,</hi> which brought the famous King <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> to his end: his words are to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: <q>The manner of his Death was this, <hi>Symmachus</hi> and his Son-in-law <hi>Boëthius,</hi> just men and great relievers of the poor, Senatours and Consuls, had many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by whose false accusations <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorick</hi> being perswaded that they plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against him, put them to death and confiscated their Estates. Not long after his Waiters set before him at Supper a great Head of a Fish, which seemed to him to be the Head of <hi>Symmachus</hi> lately mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered; and with his Teeth sticking out, and fierce glaring eyes to threaten him:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41958:55"/>
being frighted, he grew chill, went to Bed, lamenting what he had done to <hi>Symmachus</hi> and <hi>Boëthius;</hi> and soon after died.</q> What Fish do you apprehend this to have been? I would learn of you; give me your thoughts about it.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Return the following Answers to your Queries which were these,</p>
            <list>
               <item>[1. What Fishes are meant by the Names, <hi>Halec</hi> and <hi>Mugil?</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. What is the Bird which you will receive from the Bearer? and what
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:41958:57"/>
Birds are meant by the Names <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon, Nysus, Ciris, Nycticorax?</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. What Insect is meant by the word <hi>Cicada?]</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The word <hi>Halec</hi> we are taught to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Answer to Query 1.</note> an <hi>Herring,</hi> which, being an ancient word, is not strictly appropriable unto a Fish not known or not described by the Ancients; and which the modern Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists are fain to name <hi>Harengus;</hi> the word <hi>Halecula</hi> being applied unto such little Fish out of which they were fain to make Pickle; and <hi>Halec</hi> or <hi>Alec,</hi> taken for the Liquamen or Liquor it self, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of the Poet,</p>
            <l>—Ego faecem primus &amp; Alec</l>
            <l>Primus &amp; inveni piper album—</l>
            <p>And was a conditure and Sawce much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by Antiquity, as was also <hi>Muria</hi> and <hi>Garum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In common constructions, <hi>Mugil</hi> is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred a <hi>Mullet,</hi> which, notwithstanding, is a different Fish from the <hi>Mugil</hi> described by Authours; wherein, if we mistake, we cannot so closely apprehend the expression of <hi>Juvenal,</hi>
            </p>
            <l>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:41958:57"/>
—Quosdam ventres &amp; Mugilis intrat.</l>
            <p>And misconceive the Fish, whereby For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicatours were so opprobriously and irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely punished; for the <hi>Mugil</hi> being somewhat rough and hard skinned, did more exasperate the gutts of such offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: whereas the Mullet was a smooth Fish, and of too high esteem to be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in such offices.</p>
            <p>I cannot but wonder that this Bird you <note place="margin">Answer to Query 2.</note> sent should be a stranger unto you, and unto those who had a sight thereof: for, though it be not seen every day, yet we often meet with it in this Country. It is an elegant Bird, which he that once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth can hardly mistake any other for it. From the proper Note it is called an <hi>Hoopebird</hi> with us; in Greek <hi>Epops,</hi> in Latin <hi>Upupa.</hi> We are little obliged unto our School instruction, wherein we are taught to render <hi>Upupa</hi> a <hi>Lapwing,</hi> which Bird our natural Writers name <hi>Vannellus;</hi> for thereby we mistake this remarkable Bird, and apprehend not rightly what is delivered of it.</p>
            <p>We apprehend not the Hieroglyphical considerations which the old Aegyptians made of this observable Bird; who consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41958:58"/>
dering therein the order and variety of Colours, the twenty six or twenty eight Feathers in its Crest, his latitancy, and mewing this handsome outside in the Winter; they made it an Emblem of the varieties of the World, the succession of Times and Seasons, and signal mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in them. And therefore <hi>Orus,</hi> the Hieroglyphick of the World, had the Head of an Hoopebird upon the top of his Staff.</p>
            <p>Hereby we may also mistake the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiphath,</hi> or Bird forbidden for Food in <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viticus;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Levit. 11. 19.</note> and, not knowing the Bird, may the less apprehend some reasons of that prohibition; that is, the magical virtues ascribed unto it by the Aegyptians, and the superstitious apprehensions which that Nation held of it, whilst they precisely numbred the Feathers and Colours there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, while they placed it on the Heads of their Gods, and near their Mercurial Cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and so highly magnified this Bird in their sacred Symbols.</p>
            <p>Again, not knowing or mistaking this Bird, we may misapprehend, or not close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehend, that handsome expression of <hi>Ovid,</hi> when <hi>Tereus</hi> was turned into an <hi>Upupa,</hi> or Hoopebird.</p>
            <l>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:41958:58"/>
Vertitur in volucrem cui sunt pro vertice Cristae,</l>

            <p>For, in this military shape, he is aptly phancied even still revengefully to pursue his hated Wife <hi>Progne:</hi> in the propriety of his Note crying out, <hi>Pou, pou, ubi, ubi,</hi> or <hi>Where are you?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor are we singly deceived in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal translation of this Bird: in many other Animals we commit the like mistake. So <hi>Gracculus</hi> is rendred a <hi>Jay,</hi> which Bird notwithstanding must be of a dark colour according to that of <hi>Martial,</hi>
            </p>
            <l>Sed quandam volo nocte nigriorem</l>
            <l>Formica, pice, Gracculo, cicada.</l>

               <note n="*" place="margin">See Vulg. Err. B. 3. c. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Halcyon</hi> is rendred a <hi>King-fisher,</hi> a Bird commonly known among us, and by Zoographers and Naturals the same is named <hi>Ispida,</hi> a well coloured Bird fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting Streams and Rivers, building in holes of Pits, like some Martins, about the end of the Spring; in whose Nests we have found little else than innumerable small Fish Bones, and white round Eggs of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41958:59"/>
a smooth and polished surface, whereas the true <hi>Alcyon</hi> is a Sea Bird, makes an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Nest floating upon the Water, and breedeth in the Winter.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Nysus</hi> should be rendred either an <hi>Hobby</hi> or a <hi>Sparrow Hawk,</hi> in the Fable of <hi>Nysus</hi> and <hi>Scylla</hi> in <hi>Ovid,</hi> because we are much to seek in the distinction of Hawks according to their old denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we shall not much contend, and may allow a favourable latitude therein: but that the <hi>Ciris</hi> or Bird into which <hi>Scyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> was turned should be translated a <hi>Lark,</hi> it can hardly be made out agreeable unto the description of <hi>Virgil</hi> in his Poem of that name,</p>
            <l>Inde alias volucres mimóque infecta rubenti Crura—</l>
            <p>But seems more agreeable unto some kind of <hi>Hoemantopus</hi> or Redshank; and so the <hi>Nysus</hi> to have been some kind of Hawk, which delighteth about the Sea and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes, where such prey most aboundeth, which sort of Hawk while <hi>Scaliger</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth to be a Merlin, the French Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latour warily expoundeth it to be some kind of Hawk.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nycticorax</hi> we may leave unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and verbal translation of a <hi>Night Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:41958:59"/>
but we know no proper kind of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto which to confine the same, and therefore some take the liberty to ascribe it unto some sort of Owls, and others unto the Bittern; which Bird in its common Note, which he useth out of the time of coupling and upon the Wing, so well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth the croaking of a Raven that I have been deceived by it.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Cicada</hi> is rendred a <hi>Grashopper,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Answer to Query 3.</note> we commonly think that which is so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led among us to be the true <hi>Cicada;</hi> wherein, as we have elsewhere <note place="margin">Vulg. Err. B. 5. c. 3.</note> declared, there is a great mistake: for we have not the <hi>Cicada</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and indeed no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per word for that Animal, which the French nameth <hi>Cigale.</hi> That which we commonly call a Grashopper, and the French <hi>Saulterelle</hi> being one kind of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cust, so rendred in the Plague of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and, in old Saxon named <hi>Gersthop.</hi>

            <head>TRACT V. OF HAWKS AND FALCONRY, Ancient and Modern.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN vain you expect much informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>de Re Accipitraria,</hi> of Falconry, Hawks or Hawking, from very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Greek or Latin Authours; that Art being either unknown or so little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced among them, that it seems to have proceeded no higher than the daring of Birds: which makes so little thereof to be found in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who onely mentions
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41958:61"/>
some rude practice thereof in <hi>Thracia;</hi> as also in <hi>Aelian,</hi> who speaks something of Hawks and Crows among the Indians; little or nothing of true Falconry being mention'd before <hi>Julius Firmicus,</hi> in the days of <hi>Constantius,</hi> Son to <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great.</p>
            <p>Yet if you consult the accounts of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Antiquity left by <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Greek, by <hi>Symmachus</hi> and <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and by <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Magnus,</hi> about five hundred years ago, you, who have been so long acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this noble Recreation, may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter compare the ancient and modern prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and rightly observe how many things in that Art are added, varied, disused or retained in the practice of these days.</p>
            <p>In the Diet of Hawks, they allowed of divers Meats which we should hardly commend. For beside the Flesh of Beef, they admitted of Goat, Hog, Deer, Whelp and Bear. And how you will approve the quantity and measure thereof, I make some doubt; while by weight they allowed half a pound of Beef, seven ounces of Swines Flesh, five of Hare, eight ounces of Whelp, as much of Deer, and ten ounces of He-Goats Flesh.</p>
            <p>In the time of <hi>Demetrius</hi> they were not without the practice of Phlebotomy or Bleeding, which they used in the Thigh and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41958:61"/>
Pounces; they plucked away the Feathers on the Thigh, and rubbed the part, but if the Vein appeared not in that part, they opened the Vein of the fore Talon.</p>
            <p>In the days of <hi>Albertus,</hi> they made use of Cauteries in divers places: to advantage their sight they seared them under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward angle of the eye; above the eye in distillations and diseases of the Head; in upward pains they seared above the Joint of the Wing, and at the bottom of the Foot, against the Gout; and the chief time for these cauteries they made to be the month of <hi>March.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In great coldness of Hawks they made use of Fomentations, some of the steam or vapour of artificial and natural Baths, some wrapt them up in hot Blankets, giving them Nettle Seeds and Butter.</p>
            <p>No Clysters are mention'd, nor can they be so profitably used; but they made use of many purging Medicines. They pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with Aloe, which, unto larger Hawks, they gave in the bigness of a Greek Bean; unto less, in the quantity of a <hi>Cicer,</hi> which notwithstanding I should rather give wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and with a few drops of Oil of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds: for the Guts of flying Fowls are tender and easily scratched by it; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the use of Aloe both in Hawks and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morants I have sometimes observed bloody excretions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:41958:62"/>
In phlegmatick causes they seldom o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>Stavesaker,</hi> but they purged some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with a Mouse, and the Food of boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chickens, sometimes with good Oil and Honey.</p>
            <p>They used also the Ink of Cuttle Fishes, with Smallage, Betony, Wine and Honey. They made use of stronger Medicines than present practice doth allow. For they were not afraid to give <hi>Coccus Baphicus;</hi> beating up eleven of its Grains unto a Lentor, which they made up into five Pills wrapt up with Honey and Pepper: and, in some of their old Medicines, we meet with Scammony and <hi>Euphorbium.</hi> Whether, in the tender Bowels of Birds, infusions of Rhubarb, Agaric and Mecho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>achan be not of safer use, as to take of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary two Drachms, of Cinnamon half a Drachm, of Liquorish a Scruple, and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing them in Wine, to express a part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mouth of the Hawk, may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by present practice.</p>
            <p>Few Mineral Medicines were of inward use among them: yet sometimes we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve they gave filings of Iron in the strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Chest, as also Lime in some of their pectoral Medicines.</p>
            <p>But they commended Unguents of Quick-silver against the Scab: and I have safely given six or eight Grains of <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:41958:62"/>
               <hi>Dulcis</hi> unto Kestrils and Owls, as also crude and current Quick-silver, giving the next day small Pellets of Silver or Lead till they came away uncoloured: and this, if any, may probably destroy that obstinate Disease of the <hi>Filander</hi> or Back-worm.</p>
            <p>A peculiar remedy they had against the Consumption of Hawks. For, filling a Chicken with Vinegar, they closed up the Bill, and hanging it up untill the Flesh grew tender, they fed the Hawk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: and to restore and well Flesh them, they commonly gave them Hogs Flesh, with Oil, Butter and Honey; and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Cumfory to bouze.</p>
            <p>They disallowed of salt Meats and Fat; but highly esteemed of Mice in most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispositions; and in the falling Sickness had great esteem of boiled Batts: and in many Diseases, of the Flesh of Owls which feed upon those Animals. In Epilepsies they also gave the Brain of a Kid drawn thorough a gold Ring; and, in Convulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, made use of a mixture of Musk and <hi>Stercus humanum aridum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the better preservation of their Health they strowed Mint and Sage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them; and for the speedier mew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Feathers, they gave them the Slough of a Snake, or a Tortoise out of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41958:63"/>
the Shell, or a green Lizard cut in pieces.</p>
            <p>If a Hawk were unquiet, they hooded him, and placed him in a Smith's Shop for some time, where, accustomed to the continual noise of hammering, he became more gentle and tractable.</p>
            <p>They used few terms of Art, plainly and intelligibly expressing the Parts affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, their Diseases and Remedies. This heap of artificial terms first entring with the French Artists: who seem to have been the first and noblest Falconers in the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern part of <hi>Europe;</hi> although, in their Language, they have no word which in general expresseth an Hawk.</p>
            <p>They carried their Hawks in the left hand, and let them flie from the right. They used a Bell, and took great care that their Jesses should not be red, lest Eagles should flie at them. Though they used Hoods, we have no clear description of them, and little account of their Lures.</p>
            <p>The ancient Writers lest no account of the swiftness of Hawks or measure of their flight: but <note place="margin">De Re Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stica.</note> 
               <hi>Heresbachius</hi> delivers that <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Cleve</hi> had an Hawk which, in one day, made a flight out of <hi>Westphalia</hi> into <hi>Prussia.</hi> And, upon good account, an Hawk in this Country of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> made a flight at a Woodcock near thirty miles in one hour. How far the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41958:63"/>
Hawks, Merlins and wild Fowl which come unto us with a North-west wind in the Autumn, flie in a day, there is no clear account; but coming over Sea their flight hath been long, or very speedy. For I have known them to light so weary on the coast, that many have been taken with Dogs, and some knock'd down with Staves and Stones.</p>
            <p>Their Perches seem not so large as ours; for they made them of such a bigness that their Talons might almost meet: and they chose to make them of Sallow, Poplar or Lime Tree.</p>
            <p>They used great clamours and hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their flight, which they made by these words, <hi>ou loi, la, la, la;</hi> and to raise the Fowls, made use of the found of a Cymbal.</p>
            <p>Their recreation seemed more sober and solemn than ours at present, so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly attended with Oaths and Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. For they called on God at their setting out, according to the account of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in the first place calling upon God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The learned <hi>Rigaltius</hi> thinketh, that if the Romans had well known this airy Chase, they would have left or less regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their Circensial Recreations. The Greeks understood Hunting early, but
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41958:64"/>
little or nothing of our Falconry. If <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> had known it, we might have found something of it and more of Hawks in <hi>Aristotle;</hi> who was so unacquainted with that way, that he thought that Hawks would not feed upon the Heart of Birds. Though he hath mention'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Hawks, yet <hi>Julius Scaliger,</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Falconer, despaired to reconcile them unto ours. And 'tis well if, among them, you can clearly make out a Lanner, a Sparrow Hawk and a Kestril, but must not hope to find your Gier Falcon there, which is the noble Hawk; and I wish you one no worse than that of <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Navarre;</hi> which, <hi>Scaliger</hi> saith, he saw strike down a Buzzard, two wild Geese, divers Kites, a Crane and a Swan.</p>
            <p>Nor must you expect from high Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity the distinctions of Eyess and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage Hawks, of Sores and Entermewers, of Hawks of the Lure and the Fist; nor that material distinction into short and long winged Hawks; from whence arife such differences in their taking down of Stones; in their flight, their striking down or seizing of their Prey, in the strength of their Talons, either in the Heel and fore-Talon, or the middle and the Heel: nor yet what Eggs produce the different Hawks, or when they lay three Eggs,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41958:64"/>
that the first produceth a Female and large Hawk, the second of a midler sort, and the third a smaller Bird Tercellene or Tassel of the Masle Sex; which Hawks being onely observed abroad by the Ancients, were looked upon as Hawks of different kinds and not of the same Eyrie or Nest. As for what <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirmeth that Hawks and Birds of prey drink not; although you know that it will not strictly hold, yet I kept an Eagle two years, which fed upon Kats, Kittlings, Whelps and Ratts, without one drop of Water.</p>

            <head>TRACT VIII. OF LANGUAGES, And particularly of the SAXON TONGUE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE last Discourse we had of the Saxon Tongue recalled to my mind some forgotten considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Though the Earth were widely peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled before the Flood, (as many learned men conceive) yet whether after a large dispersion, and the space of sixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, men maintained so uniform a Language in all parts, as to be strictly of one Tongue, and readily to understand each other, may very well be doubted.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41958:70"/>
For though the World preserved in the Family of <hi>Noah</hi> before the confusion of Tongues might be said to be of one Lip, yet even permitted to themselves their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, inventions, necessities, and new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, without the miracle of Confusion at first, in so long a tract of time, there had probably been a Babel. For whether <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi> were first peopled by one or seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nations, yet cannot that number of different planting Nations, answer the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of their present different Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, of no affinity unto each other; and even in their Northern Nations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating Angles, their Languages are widely differing. A native Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter brought from <hi>Califormia</hi> proved of no use unto the Spaniards upon the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Shore. From <hi>Chiapa,</hi> to <hi>Guatemala, S. Salvador, Honduras,</hi> there are at least eighteen several Languages; and so nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous are they both in the Peruvian and Mexican Regions, that the great Princes are fain to have one common Language, which besides their vernaculous and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tongues, may serve for commerce between them.</p>
            <p>And since the confusion of Tongues at first fell onely upon those which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in <hi>Sinaar</hi> at the work of <hi>Babel,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the primitive Language from <hi>Noah</hi>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:41958:70"/>
were onely preserved in the Family of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and not also in divers others, which might be absent at the same, whether all came away and many might not be left behind in their first Plantations about the foot of the Hills, whereabout the Ark re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted and <hi>Noah</hi> became an Husbandman, is not absurdly doubted.</p>
            <p>For so the primitive Tongue might in time branch out into several parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> and thereby the first or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Tongue which seems to be ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent into so many Languages, might have larger originals and grounds of its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication and traduction than from the Family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Country of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> and words contained in the Bible which come short of the full of that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. And this would become more probable from the Septuagint or Greek Chronology strenuously asserted by <hi>Vos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius;</hi> for making five hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Deluge and the days of <hi>Peleg,</hi> there ariseth a large latitude of multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and dispersion of People into several parts, before the descent of that Body which followed <hi>Nimrod</hi> unto <hi>Sinaar</hi> from the East.</p>
            <p>They who derive the bulk of European Tongues from the Scythian and the Greek, though they may speak probably in many
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41958:71"/>
points, yet must needs allow vast diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or corruptions from so few origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, which however might be tolerably made out in the old Saxon, yet hath time much confounded the clearer derivations. And as the knowledge thereof now stands in reference unto our selves, I find many words totally lost, divers of harsh sound disused or refined in the pronunciation, and many words we have also in common use not to be found in that Tongue, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nially derivable from any other from whence we have largely borrowed, and yet so much still remaineth with us that it maketh the gross of our Language.</p>
            <p>The religious obligation unto the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Language hath so notably continued the same, that it might still be understood by <hi>Abraham,</hi> whereas by the <hi>Mazorite</hi> Points and Chaldee Character the old Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter stands so transformed, that if <hi>Moses</hi> were alive again, he must be taught to reade his own Law.</p>
            <p>The Chinoys, who live at the bounds of the Earth, who have admitted little communication, and suffered successive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions from one Nation, may possibly give account of a very ancient Language; but consisting of many Nations and Tongues; confusion, admixtion and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in length of time might probably
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:41958:71"/>
so have crept in as without the virtue of a common Character, and lasting Letter of things, they could never probably make out those strange memorials which they pretend, while they still make use of the Works of their great <hi>Confutius</hi> many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before Christ, and in a series ascend as high as <hi>Poncuus,</hi> who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived our <hi>Noah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The present Welch, and remnant of the old Britanes, hold so much of that ancient Language, that they make a shift to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Poems of <hi>Merlin, Enerin, Telesin,</hi> a thousand years ago, whereas the Herulian <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> set down by <hi>Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gangus Lazius,</hi> is not without much criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism made out, and but in some words; and the present Parisians can hardly hack out those few lines of the League between <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Lewis,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Ludovicus Pius,</hi> yet remaining in old French.</p>
            <p>The Spaniards, in their corruptive tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and Romance, have so happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the terminations from the Latin, that notwithstanding the Gothick and Moorish intrusion of words, they are able to make a Discourse completely consisting of Grammatical Latin and Spanish, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Italians and French will be very much to seek.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:41958:72"/>
The learned <hi>Casaubon</hi> conceiveth that a Dialogue might be composed in Saxon onely of such words as are derivable from the Greek, which surely might be effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and so as the learned might not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easily find it out. <hi>Verstegan</hi> made no doubt that he could contrive a Letter which might be understood by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, Dutch and East Frislander, which, as the present confusion standeth, might have proved no very clear Piece, and hardly to be hammer'd out: yet so much of the Saxon still remaineth in our English, as may admit an orderly discourse and series of good sense, such as not onely the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent English, but <hi>Aelfric, Bede</hi> and <hi>Alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> might understand after so many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years.</p>
            <p>Nations that live promiscuously, under the Power and Laws of Conquest, do sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom escape the loss of their Language with their Liberties, wherein the Romans were so strict that the Grecians were fain to conform in their judicial Processes; which made the Jews loose more in seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years dispersion in the Provinces of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> than in many hundred in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct habitation in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish which dwelt dispersedly to loose their Language in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whereas more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reliques there are thereof in <hi>Fingall,</hi>

where they were closely and almost solely planted; and the Moors which were most huddled together and united about <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> have yet left their <hi>Arvirage</hi> among the Granadian Spaniards.</p>
            <p>But shut up in Angles and inaccessible corners, divided by Laws and Manners, they often continue long with little mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which hath afforded that lasting life unto the Cantabrian and British Tongue, wherein the Britanes are remarkable, who, having lived four hundred years together with the Romans, retained so much of the British as it may be esteemed a Language; which either they resolutely maintained in their cohabitation with them in Britane, or retiring after in the time of the Saxons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Countries and parts less civiliz'd and conversant with the Romans, they found the People distinct, the Language more intire, and so fell into it again.</p>
            <p>But surely no Languages have been so straitly lock'd up as not to admit of commixture. The Irish, although they retain a kind of a Saxon Character, yet have admitted many words of Latin and English. In the Welch are found many words from Latin, some from Greek and Saxon. In what parity and incommixture the Language of that People stood which were casually discovered in the heart of

               <hi>Spain,</hi> between the Mountains of <hi>Castile,</hi> no longer ago than in the time of Duke <hi>D' Alva,</hi> we have not met with a good account any farther than that their words were Basquish or Cantabrian: but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Basquensa one of the minor Mother Tongues of <hi>Europe,</hi> is not without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of Latin and Castilian, while we meet with <hi>Santifiea, tentationeten, Glaria, puissanea,</hi> and four more in the short Form of the Lord's Prayer, set down by <hi>Paulus Merula:</hi> but although in this brief Form we may find such commixture, yet the bulk of their Language seems more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, consisting of words of no affinity unto others, of numerals totally different, of differing Grammatical Rule, as may be observed in the Dictionary and short <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quensa</hi> Grammar, composed by <hi>Raphael Nicoleta,</hi> a Priest of <hi>Bilboa.</hi>

            <p>And if they use the auxiliary Verbs of <hi>Equin</hi> and <hi>Ysan,</hi> answerable unto <hi>Hazer</hi> and <hi>Ser,</hi> to Have, and Be, in the Spanish, which Forms came in with the Northern Nations into the Italian, Spanish and French, and if that Form were used by them before, and crept not in from imitation of their neighbours, it may shew some ancienter traduction from Northern Nations, or else must seem very strange; since the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Nations had it not of old, and I

know not whether any such mode be found in the Languages of any part of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Romans, who made the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture and alteration of Languages in the World, effected the same, not onely by their proper Language, but those also of their military Forces, employed in several Provinces, as holding a standing <hi>Militia</hi> in all Countries, and commonly of strange Nations; so while the cohorts and Forces of the Britanes were quartered in <hi>Aegypt, Armenia, Spain, Illyria,</hi> &amp;c. the Stablae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians and Dalmatians here, the Gauls, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards and Germans in other Countries, and other Nations in theirs, they could not but leave many words behind them, and carry away many with them, which might make that in many words of very distinct Nations some may still remain of very unknown and doubtfull Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</p>
            <p>And if, as the learned <hi>Buxhornius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth, the Scythian Language as the Mother Tongue runs through the Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> and even as far as <hi>Persia,</hi> the community in many words between so many Nations, hath a more reasonable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal traduction, and were rather deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable from the common Tongue diffused through them all, than from any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

Nation, which hath also borrowed and holdeth but at second hand.</p>
            <p>The Saxons settling over all <hi>England,</hi> maintained an uniform Language, onely diversified in Dialect, Idioms, and minor differences, according to their different Nations which came in to the common Conquest, which may yet be a cause of the variation in the speech and words of several parts of <hi>England,</hi> where different Nations most abode or settled, and having expelled the Britanes, their Wars were chiefly among themselves, with little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with foreign Nations untill the union of the Heptarchy under <hi>Egbert;</hi> after which time although the Danes infested this Land and scarce left any part free, yet their incursions made more havock in Buildings, Churches and Cities, than the Language of the Country, because their Language was in effect the same, and such as whereby they might easily understand one another.</p>
            <p>And if the Normans, which came into <hi>Neustria</hi> or <hi>Normandy</hi> with <hi>Rollo</hi> the Dane, had preserved their Language in their new acquists, the succeeding Conquest of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by Duke <hi>William</hi> of his race, had not begot among us such notable alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but having lost their Language in their abode in <hi>Normandy</hi> before they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41958:74"/>
upon <hi>England,</hi> they confounded the English with their French, and made the grand mutation, which was succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively encreased by our possessions in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy, Guien</hi> and <hi>Aquitain,</hi> by our long Wars in <hi>France,</hi> by frequent resort of the French, who to the number of some thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands came over with <hi>Isabel</hi> Queen to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Second, and the several Matches of <hi>England</hi> with the Daughters of <hi>France</hi> before and since that time.</p>
            <p>But this commixture, though sufficient to confuse, proved not of ability to abolish the Saxon words; for from the French we have borrowed many Substantives, Adjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and some Verbs, but the great Body of Numerals, auxiliary Verbs, Articles, Pronouns, Adverbs, Conjunctions and Prepositions, which are the distinguishing and lasting part of a Language, remain with us from the Saxon, which, having suffered no great alteration for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, may probably still remain, though the English swell with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of Italian, French and Latin. An Example whereof may be observ'd in this following,</p>

            <p>Now of this account the French will be able to make nothing; the modern Danes and Germans, though from several words they may conjecture at the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet will they be much to seek in the orderly sense and continued construc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

thereof, whether the Danes can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue such a series of sense out of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Language and the old Runick, as to be intelligible unto present and ancient times, some doubt may well be made; and if the present French would attempt a Discourse in words common unto their present Tongue and the old <hi>Romana Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stica</hi> spoken in Elder times, or in the old Language of the Francks, which came to be in use some successions after <hi>Pharamond,</hi> it might prove a Work of some trouble to effect.</p>
            <p>It were not impossible to make an Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal reduction of many words of no ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral reception in <hi>England</hi> but of common use in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> or peculiar to the East Angle Countries; as, <hi>Bawnd, Bunny, Thurck, Enemmis, Sammodithee, Mawther, Kedge, Seele, Straft, Clever, Matchly, Dere, Nicked, Stingy, Noneare, Feft, Thepes, Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good, Kamp, Sibrit, Fangast, Sap, Cothish, Thokish, Bide owe, Paxwax:</hi> of these and some others of no easie originals, when time will permit, the resolution may be attempted; which to effect, the Danish Language new and more ancient may prove of good advantage: which Nation remained here fifty years upon agreement, and have left many Families in it, and the Language of these parts had surely been

            <p>Others may think to expound it from the French word <hi>Droit</hi> or <hi>Droyt.</hi> For, whereas in elder times, the <hi>Presidents</hi> and <hi>Supremes</hi> of Courts were termed <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns,</hi> men might conceive this a distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Title and proper unto the King as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently and by right the Sovereign.</p>
            <p>A third exposition may be made from some Saxon Original, particularly from <hi>Driht, Domine,</hi> or <hi>Drihten, Dominus,</hi> in the Saxon Language, the word for <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> throughout the Saxon Psalms, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the expression of the year of our Lord in the Decretal Epistle of Pope <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho</hi> unto <hi>Athelred</hi> King of the Mercians, <hi>Anno,</hi> 680.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verstegan</hi> would have this term <hi>Drihten</hi> appropriate unto God. Yet, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of <note n="*" place="margin">V. Cl. Spelman<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <p>COncerning artificial Mounts and Hills, raised without Fortifications atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them, in most parts of <hi>England,</hi> the most considerable thereof I conceive to be of two kinds; that is, either signal Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries and Land-marks, or else sepulchral Monuments or Hills of Interrment for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable and eminent persons, especially such as died in the Wars.</p>
               <p>As for such which are sepulchral Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, upon bare and naked view they are not appropriable unto any of the three Nations of the Romans, Saxons or Danes, who, after the Britaines, have possessed this Land; because upon strict account, they may be appliable unto them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:41958:81"/>
For that the Romans used such hilly Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pultures, beside many other testimonies, seems confirmable from the practice of <hi>Germanicus,</hi> who thus interred the unbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Bones of the slain Souldiers of <hi>Varus;</hi> and that expression of <hi>Virgil,</hi> of high an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity among the Latins,</p>
               <l>—<hi>facit ingens monte sub alto</hi>

               <l>
                  <hi>Regis Dercenni terreno ex aggere Bustum.</hi>
               </l>
               <p>That the Saxons made use of this way is collectible from several Records, and that pertinent expression of <note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>That the Danes observed this practice, their own Antiquities do frequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, and it stands precisely delivered by <hi>Adolphus Cyprius,</hi> as the learned <note n="†" place="margin">

                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:41958:82"/>
And the like Monuments are yet to be observed in <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> in no small numbers.</p>
               <p>So that upon a single view and outward observation they may be the Monuments of any of these three Nations: Although the greatest number, not improbably, of the Saxons; who fought many Battels with the Britaines and Danes, and also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their own Nations, and left the proper name of Burrows for these Hills still retained in many of them, as the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Burrows upon <hi>Salisbury</hi> Plain, and in many other parts of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But of these and the like Hills there can be no clear and assured decision with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an ocular exploration, and subterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enquiry by cutting through one of them either directly or crosswise. For so with lesser charge discovery may be made what is under them, and consequently the intention of their erection.</p>
               <p>For if they were raised for remarkable and eminent Boundaries, then about their bottom will be found the lasting substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of burnt Bones of Beasts, of Ashes, Bricks, Lime or Coals.</p>
               <p>If Urns be found, they might be erected by the Romans before the term of Urn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burying or custom of burning the dead expired: but if raised by the Romans after
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:41958:82"/>
that period; Inscriptions, Swords, Shields and Arms after the Roman mode, may afford a good distinction.</p>
               <p>But if these Hills were made by Saxons or Danes, discovery may be made from the fashion of their Arms, Bones of their Horses, and other distinguishing substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces buried with them.</p>
               <p>And for such an attempt there wanteth not encouragement. For a like Mount or Burrow was opened in the days of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth upon <hi>Barham</hi> Down in <hi>Kent,</hi> by the care of Mr. <hi>Thomas Digges</hi> and charge of Sir <hi>Christopher Hales;</hi> and a large Urn with Ashes was found under it, as is delivered by <hi>Thomas Twinus De Rebus Albionicis,</hi> a learned Man of that Country, <hi>Sub incredibili Terroe acervo, Urna cinere ossium magnorum fragmentis plena, cùm galeis, clypeis oeneis &amp; ferreis rubigine ferè consumptis, inusitatoe magnitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis, eruta est: sed nulla inscriptio nomen, nullum testimonium tempus, aut fortunam exponebant:</hi> and not very long ago, as <note n="*" place="margin">Cambd.

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute> 
               <hi>To your Geographical Queries, I answer as follows.</hi>
            </opener>
            <p>IN sundry passages of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> and Epistles of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> we meet with the word <hi>Troas;</hi> how he went from <hi>Troas</hi> to <hi>Philippi</hi> in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> from thence unto
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:41958:84"/>
               <hi>Troas</hi> again: how he remained seven days in that place; from thence on foot to <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sos,</hi> whither the Disciples had sailed from <hi>Troas,</hi> and there, taking him in, made their Voyage unto <hi>Caesarea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, whether this <hi>Troas</hi> be the name of a City or a certain Region seems no groundless doubt of yours: for that 'twas sometimes taken in the signification of some Country, is acknowledged by <hi>Orte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Stephanus</hi> and <hi>Grotius;</hi> and it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set down by <hi>Strabo,</hi> that a Region of <hi>Phrygia</hi> in <hi>Asia minor</hi> was so taken in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times; and that, at the Trojan War, all the Territory which comprehended the nine Principalities subject unto the King of <hi>Ilium,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, was called by the name of <hi>Troja.</hi> And this might seem sufficiently to salve the intention of the description, when he came or went from <hi>Troas,</hi> that is, some part of that Region; and will otherwise seem strange unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny how he should be said to go or come from that City which all Writers had laid in the Ashes about a thousand years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>All which notwithstanding, since we reade in the Text a particular abode of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven days, and such particulars as leaving of his Cloak, Books and Parchments at <hi>Troas:</hi> And that S. <hi>Luke</hi> seems to have
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:41958:84"/>
been taken in to the Travels of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in this place, where he begins in the <hi>Acts</hi> to write in the first person, this may rather seem to have been some City or special Habitation, than any Province or Region without such limitation.</p>
            <p>Now that such a City there was, and that of no mean note, is easily verified from historical observation. For though old <hi>Ilium</hi> was anciently destroyed, yet was there another raised by the relicts of that people, not in the same place, but about thirty Furlongs westward, as is to be learned from <hi>Strabo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this place <hi>Alexander</hi> in his Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against <hi>Darius</hi> took especial notice, endowing it with sundry Immunities, with promise of greater matters at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Persia;</hi> inclined hereunto from the honour he bore unto <hi>Homer,</hi> whose earnest Reader he was, and upon whose Poems, by the help of <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> and <hi>Callisthenes,</hi> he made some observations. As also much moved hereto upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his cognation with the <hi>Aeacides</hi> and Kings of <hi>Molossus,</hi> whereof <hi>Androma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che</hi> the Wife of <hi>Hector</hi> was Queen. After the death of <hi>Alexander, Lysimachus</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded it with a Wall, and brought the inhabitants of the neighbour Towns unto it, and so it bore the name of <hi>Alexandria;</hi>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:41958:85"/>
which, from <hi>Antigonus,</hi> was also called <hi>Antigonia,</hi> according to the inscription of that famous Medal in <hi>Goltsius, Colonia Troas Antigonia Alexandrea, Legio vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sima prima.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Romans first went into <hi>Asia</hi> against <hi>Antiochus</hi> 'twas but a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and no great City; but, upon the Peace concluded, the Romans much advanced the same. <hi>Fimbria,</hi> the rebellious Roman, spoiled it in the Mithridatick War, boasting that he had subdued <hi>Troy</hi> in eleven days which the Grecians could not take in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as many years. But it was again re-built and countenanced by the Romans, and became a Roman Colony, with great Immunities conferred on it; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly it is so set down by <hi>Ptolomy.</hi> For the Romans, deriving themselves from the Trojans, thought no favour too great for it; especially <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> who, both in imitation of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and for his own descent from <hi>Julus,</hi> of the posterity of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,</hi> with much passion affected it, and, in a discontented humour, <note n="*" place="margin">Sueton.</note> was once in mind to translate the Roman wealth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; so that it became a very remarkable place, and was, in <hi>Strabo</hi>'s time, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, one of the noble Cities of <hi>Asia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:41958:85"/>
And, if they understood the prediction of <hi>Homer</hi> in reference unto the Romans, as some expound it in <hi>Strabo,</hi> it might much promote their affection unto that place; which being a remarkable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and scarce to be parallel'd in Pagan story, made before <hi>Rome</hi> was built, and concerning the lasting Reign of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> they could not but take especial notice of it. For thus is <hi>Neptune</hi> made to speak, when he saved <hi>Aeneas</hi> from the fury of <hi>Achilles.</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>Verum agite hunc subito praesenti à morte trahamus</l>

               <l>Et nati natorum &amp; qui nascentur ab illis.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The Roman favours were also continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s days; for <note n="*" place="margin">Sueton.</note> 
               <hi>Claudius,</hi> producing an ancient Letter of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans unto King <hi>Seleucus</hi> concerning the Trojan Privileges, made a Release of their Tributes; and <hi>Nero</hi> elegantly pleaded for <note place="margin">Tacit. <hi>l.</hi> 13.</note>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:41958:86"/>
their Immunities, and remitted all Tributes unto them.</p>
            <p>And, therefore, there being so remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable a City in this Territory, it may seem too hard to loose the same in the general name of the Country; and since it was so eminently favoured by Emperours, enjoying so many Immunities, and full of Roman Privileges, it was probably very populous, and a fit abode for S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who being a Roman Citizen, might live more quietly himself, and have no small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of faithfull well-wishers in it.</p>
            <p>Yet must we not conceive that this was the old <hi>Troy,</hi> or re-built in the same place with it: for <hi>Troas</hi> was placed about thirty Furlongs West, and upon the Sea shore; so that, to hold a clearer apprehension hereof than is commonly delivered in the Discourses of the Ruines of <hi>Troy,</hi> we may consider one Inland <hi>Troy</hi> or old <hi>Ilium,</hi> which was built farther within the Land, and so was removed from the Port where the Grecian Fleet lay in <hi>Homer;</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Maritime <hi>Troy,</hi> which was upon the Sea Coast placed in the Maps of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> between <hi>Lectum</hi> and <hi>Sigaeum</hi> or Port <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizam,</hi> Southwest from the old City, which was this of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and whereunto are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable the particular accounts of <hi>Bellonius,</hi> when, not an hundred years ago, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41958:86"/>
the Ruines of <hi>Troy</hi> with their Baths, Aqueducts, Walls and Towers, to be seen from the Sea as he sailed between it and <hi>Tenedos;</hi> and where, upon nearer view, he observed some signs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of his conversion in the ruines of Churches, Crosses, and Inscriptions upon Stones.</p>
            <p>Nor was this onely a famous City in the days of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> but considerable long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For, upon the Letter of <hi>Adrianus,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Philostrat. <hi>in Vita</hi> Herodis Attici.</note> 
               <hi>Herodes Atticus,</hi> at a great charge, repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Baths, contrived Aqueducts and noble Water-courses in it. As is also col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectible from the Medals of <hi>Caracalla,</hi> of <hi>Severus,</hi> and <hi>Crispina;</hi> with Inscriptions, <hi>Colonia Alexandria Troas,</hi> bearing on the Reverse either an Horse, a Temple, or a Woman; denoting their destruction by an Horse, their prayers for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's safety, and, as some conjecture, the memory of <hi>Sibylla, Phrygia</hi> or <hi>Hellespon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor wanted this City the favour of Christian Princes, but was made a Bishop's See under the Archbishop of <hi>Cyzicum;</hi> but in succeeding discords was destroyed and ruined, and the nobler Stones translated to <hi>Constantinople</hi> by the Turks to beautifie their Mosques and other Buildings.</p>

               <head>Concerning the Dead Sea, accept of these few Remarks.</head>
               <p>IN the Map of the Dead Sea we meet with the Figure of the Cities which were destroyed: of <hi>Sodom, Gomorrha, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah</hi> and <hi>Zeboim;</hi> but with no unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; men placing them variously, and, from the uncertainty of their situation, taking a fair liberty to set them where they please.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Admah, Zeboim</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> there is no light from the Text to define their situation. But, that <hi>Sodom</hi> could not be far from <hi>Segor</hi> which was seated under the Mountains near the side of the Lake, seems inferrible from the sudden ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of <hi>Lot,</hi> who, coming from <hi>Sodom</hi> at day break, attained to <hi>Segor</hi> at Sun rising; and therefore <hi>Sodom</hi> is to be placed not many miles from it, not in the middle of the Lake, which against that place is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eighteen miles over, and so will leave nine miles to be gone in so small a space of time.</p>
               <p>The Valley being large, the Lake now in length about seventy English miles, the River <hi>Jordan</hi> and divers others running over the Plain, 'tis probable the best Cities
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41958:87"/>
were seated upon those Streams: but how the <hi>Jordan</hi> passed or winded, or where it took in the other Streams, is a point too old for Geography to determine.</p>
               <p>For, that the River gave the fruitfulness unto this Valley by over watring that low Region, seems plain from that expression in the <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 13. 10.</note> Text, that it was watered, <hi>sicut Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disus &amp; Aegyptus,</hi> like <hi>Eden</hi> and the Plains of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> where <hi>Euphrates</hi> yearly overfloweth; or like <hi>Aegypt</hi> where <hi>Nilus</hi> doth the like: and seems probable also from the same course of the River not far above this Valley where the Israelites pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Jordan,</hi> where 'tis said that <hi>Jordan oversloweth its Banks in the time of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it must have had some passage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground in the compass of this Valley before the creation of this Lake, seems ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary from the great current of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and from the Rivers <hi>Arnon, Cedron, Zaeth,</hi> which empty into this Valley; but where to place that concurrence of Waters or place of its absorbition, there is no authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick decision.</p>
               <p>The probablest place may be set some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Southward, below the Rivers that run into it on the East or Western Shore: and somewhat agreeable unto the account which <hi>Brocardus</hi> received from the Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:41958:88"/>
which lived near it, <hi>Jordanem ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di Mare Mortuum &amp; rursum egredi, sed post exiguum intervallum à Terra absorberi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Strabo</hi> speaks naturally of this Lake, that it was first caused by Earthquakes, by sulphureous and bituminous eruptions, arising from the Earth. But the Scripture makes it plain to have been from a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous hand, and by a remarkable expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>pluit Dominus ignem &amp; Sulphur à Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino.</hi> See also <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. <hi>in ardore Salis:</hi> burning the Cities and destroying all things about the Plain, destroying the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable nature of Plants and all living things, salting and making barren the whole Soil, and, by these fiery Showers, kindling and setting loose the body of the bituminous Mines, which shewed their lower Veins before but in some few Pits and openings, swallowing up the Foundation of their Cities; opening the bituminous Treasures below, and making a smoak like a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace able to be discerned by <hi>Abraham</hi> at a good distance from it.</p>

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AMong the <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Vulg. Err. <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note> Oracles of <hi>Apollo</hi> there are none more celebrated than those which he delivered unto <hi>Croesus</hi> King of <note n="†" place="margin">Herod. <hi>l.</hi> 1. 46, 47, &amp;c. 90, 91.</note> 
               <hi>Lydia,</hi> who seems of all Princes to have held the greatest depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on them. But most considerable are his plain and intelligible replies which he made unto the same King, when he
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:41958:89"/>
sent his Chains of Captivity unto <hi>Delphos,</hi> after his overthrow by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> with sad expostulations why he encouraged him unto that fatal War by his Oracle, saying, <note n="*" place="margin">Herod. <hi>Ibid.</hi> 54.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Croesus, <hi>if he Wars against the Persians, shall dissolve a great Empire.</hi> Why, at least, he prevented not that sad infelicity of his devoted and bountifull Servant, and whether it were fair or honourable for the Gods of <hi>Greece</hi> to be ingratefull: which being a plain and open delivery of <hi>Delphos,</hi> and scarce to be parallel'd in any ancient story, it may well deserve your farther consideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His first reply was, <hi>That</hi> Croesus <hi>suffered not for himself;</hi> but paid the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of his fifth predecessour, who kill'd his Master and usurp'd the dignity unto which he held no title.</p>
            <p>Now whether <hi>Croesus</hi> suffered upon this account or not, hereby he plainly betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his insufficiency to protect him; and also obliquely discovered he had a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his misfortune; for knowing that wicked act lay yet unpunished, he might well divine some of his successours might smart for it: and also understanding he was like to be the last of that race, he
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41958:89"/>
might justly fear and conclude this infeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city upon him.</p>
            <p>Hereby he also acknowledged the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable justice of God; that though Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge lay dormant, it would not always sleep; and consequently confessed the just hand of God punishing unto the third and fourth generation, nor suffering such ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities to pass for ever unrevenged.</p>
            <p>Hereby he flatteringly encouraged him in the opinion of his own merits, and that he onely suffered for other mens transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: mean while he concealed <hi>Croesus</hi> his pride, elation of mind and secure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of his own unparallel'd felicity, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the vanity, pride and height of luxury of the Lydian Nation, which the Spirit of <hi>Delphos</hi> knew well to be ripe and ready for destruction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A Second excuse was, <hi>That it is not in the power of God to hinder the Decree of Fate.</hi> A general evasion for any falsifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prediction founded upon the common opinion of Fate, which impiously subjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the power of Heaven unto it; wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discovering the folly of such as repair unto him concerning future events: which, according unto this rule, must go on as the Fates have ordered, beyond his power to prevent or theirs to avoid; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41958:90"/>
teaching that his Oracles had one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this use to render men more miserable by foreknowing their misfortunes; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Croesus</hi> himself held a sensible experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in that Daemoniacal Dream concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his eldest Son, <hi>That he should be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a Spear,</hi> which, after all care and caution, he found inevitably to befall him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In his Third Apology he assured him that he endeavoured to transfer the evil Fate and to pass it upon his Children; and did however procrastinate his infeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and deferred the destruction of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> and his own Captivity three years lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than was fatally decreed upon it.</p>
            <p>Wherein while he wipes off the stain of Ingratitude, he leaves no small doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it being out of his power to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict or transfer the Fates of his Servants, it be not also beyond it to defer such sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal events, and whereon the Fates of whole Nations do depend.</p>
            <p>As also, whether he intended or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to bring to pass what he pretended, some question might be made. For that he should attempt or think he could trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his infelicity upon his Sons, it could not consist with his judgment, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts not impossibles or things beyond his power; nor with his knowledge of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41958:90"/>
future things, and the Fates of succeeding Generations: for he understood that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy was to expire in himself, and could particularly foretell the infelicity of his Sons, and hath also made remote predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto others concerning the fortunes of many succeeding descents; as appears in that answer unto <hi>Attalus,</hi>
            </p>
            <l>Be of good courage, <hi>Attalus,</hi> thou shalt reign</l>
            <l>And thy Sons Sons, but not their Sons again.</l>
            <p>As also unto <hi>Cypselus</hi> King of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>Happy is the Man who at my Altar stands,</l>
               <l>Great <hi>Cypselus</hi> who <hi>Corinth</hi> now commands.</l>
               <l>Happy is he, his Sons shall happy be,</l>
               <l>But for their Sons, unhappy days they'll see.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Now, being able to have so large a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of future things, and of the fate of many Generations, it might well be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted he was not ignorant of the Fate of <hi>Croe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> his Sons, and well understood it was in vain to think to translate his misery upon them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the Fourth part of his reply, he clears himself of Ingratitude which Hell it self cannot hear of; alledging that he had saved his life when he was ready to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41958:91"/>
be burnt, by sending a mighty Showre, in a fair and cloudless day, to quench the Fire already kindled, which all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of <hi>Cyrus</hi> could not doe. Though this Shower might well be granted, as much concerning his honour, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his power; yet whether this merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Showre fell not out contingently or were not contrived by an higher power, which hath often pity upon Pagans, and rewardeth their vertues sometimes with extraordinary temporal favours; also, in no unlike case, who was the authour of those few fair minutes, which, in a show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, gave onely time enough for the burning of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Body, some question might be made.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The last excuse devolveth the errour and miscarriage of the business upon <hi>Croe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> and that he deceived himself by an inconsiderate misconstruction of his Oracle, that if he had doubted, he should not have passed it over in silence, but consulted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for an exposition of it. Besides, he had neither discussed, nor well perpended his Oracle concerning <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whereby he might have understood not to engage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</p>
            <p>Wherein, to speak indifferently, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and miscarriage seems chiefly to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:41958:91"/>
lie at <hi>Croesus</hi> his door, who, if not infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with confidence and security, might justly have doubted the construction: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, he had received two Oracles before, which clearly hinted an unhappy time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: the first concerning <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
            </p>
            <l>
               <hi>When ever a Mule shall o'er the Medians reign,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Stay not, but unto</hi> Hermus <hi>fly amain.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>Herein though he understood not the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Mule</hi> of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that is, of his mixed descent, and from Assyrian and Median Parents, yet he could not but apprehend some misfortune from that quarter.</p>
            <p>Though this prediction seemed a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table piece of Divination, yet did it not so highly magnifie his natural sagacity or knowledge of future events as was by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny esteemed; he having no small assistance herein from the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Persian Monarchy, and the Prophecy of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>Isaiah,</hi> wherein he might reade the name of <hi>Cyrus</hi> who should restore the Captivity of the Jews, and must, therefore, be the great Monarch and Lord of all those Nations.</p>
            <p>The same misfortune was also foretold when he demanded of <hi>Apollo</hi> if ever he should hear his dumb Son speak.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:41958:92"/>
O foolish <hi>Croesus</hi> who hast made this choice,</l>
               <l>To know when thou shalt hear thy dumb Son's voice;</l>
               <l>Better he still were mute, would nothing say,</l>
               <l>When he first speaks, look for a dismal day.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>This, if he contrived not the time and the means of his recovery, was no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary divination: yet how to make out the verity of the story some doubt may yet remain. For though the causes of deafness and dumbness were removed, yet since words are attained by hearing, and men speak not without instruction, how he should be able immediately to utter such apt and significant words, as <note n="*" place="margin">Herod. <hi>l.</hi> 1. 85.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>O Man slay not</hi> Croesus, it cannot escape some doubt, since the Story also delivers, that he was deaf and dumb, that he then first began to speak, and spake all his life after.</p>
            <p>Now, if <hi>Croesus</hi> had consulted again for a clearer exposition of what was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully delivered, whether the Oracle would have spake out the second time or affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a clearer answer, some question might be made from the examples of his practice upon the like demands.</p>
            <p>So when the Spartans had often fought with ill success against the <hi>Tegeates,</hi> they
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:41958:92"/>
consulted the Oracle what God they should appease, to become victorious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them. The answer was, <hi>that they should remove the Bones of</hi> Orestes. Though the words were plain, yet the thing was obscure, and like finding out the Body of <hi>Moses.</hi> And therefore they once more demanded in what place they should find the same; unto whom he returned this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>When in the Tegean Plains a place thou find'st</l>
               <l>Where blasts are made by two impetuous Winds,</l>
               <l>Where that that strikes is struck, blows fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low blows,</l>
               <l>There doth the Earth <hi>Orestes</hi> Bones en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Which obscure reply the wisest of <hi>Sparta</hi> could not make out, and was casually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddled by one talking with a Smith who had found large Bones of a Man buried about his House; the Oracle importing no more than a Smith's Forge, expressed by a double Bellows, the Hammer and Anvil therein.</p>
            <p>Now, why the Oracle should place such consideration upon the Bones of <hi>Orestes</hi> the Son of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> a mad man and a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:41958:93"/>
if not to promote the idolatry of the Heathens, and maintain a superstitious veneration of things of no activity, it may leave no small obscurity.</p>
            <p>Or why, in a business so clear in his knowledge, he should affect so obscure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions it may also be wondred; if it were not to maintain the wary and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive method in his answers: for, speaking obscurely in things beyond doubt within his knowledge, he might be more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably dark in matters beyond his presci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Though EI were inscribed over the Gate of <hi>Delphos,</hi> yet was there no unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in his deliveries. Sometimes with that <hi>obscurity</hi> as argued a fearfull prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; sometimes so <hi>plainly</hi> as might confirm a spirit of divinity; sometimes <hi>morally,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terring from vice and villany; another time <hi>vitiously,</hi> and in the spirit of bloud and cruelty: observably modest in his civil enigma and periphrasis of that part which old <hi>Numa</hi> would plainly <note n="*" place="margin">Plut. <hi>in</hi> Thes.</note> name, and <hi>Medea</hi> would not understand, when he advised <hi>Aegeus</hi> not to draw out his foot before, untill he arriv'd upon the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ground; whereas another time he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med too literal in that unseemly epithet unto <hi>Cyanus</hi> King of * <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and put a <note place="margin">† <hi>V.</hi> Herod.</note> beastly trouble upon all <hi>Aegypt</hi> to find out
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41958:93"/>
the Urine of a true Virgin. Sometimes, more beholding unto memory than inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he delighted to express himself in the bare Verses of <hi>Homer.</hi> But that he principally affected Poetry, and that the Priest not onely or always composed his prosal raptures into Verse, seems plain from his necromantical Prophecies, whilst the dead Head in <hi>Phlegon</hi> delivers a long Prediction in Verse; and at the raising of the Ghost of <hi>Commodus</hi> unto <hi>Caracalla,</hi> when none of his Ancestours would speak, the divining Spirit versified his infelicities; corresponding herein to the apprehensions of elder times, who conceived not onely a Majesty but something of Divinity in Poetry, and as in ancient times the old Theologians delivered their inventions.</p>
            <p>Some critical Readers might expect in his oraculous Poems a more than ordinary strain and true spirit of <hi>Apollo;</hi> not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to find that Spirits make Verses like Men, beating upon the filling Epithet, and taking the licence of dialects and lower helps, common to humane Poetry; wherein, since <hi>Scaliger,</hi> who hath spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red none of the Greeks, hath thought it wisedom to be silent, we shall make no excursion.</p>
            <p>Others may wonder how the curiosity of elder times, having this opportunity of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:41958:94"/>
his Answers, omitted Natural Questions; or how the old Magicians discovered no more Philosophy; and if they had the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of Spirits, could rest content with the bare assertions of things, without the knowledge of their causes; whereby they had made their Acts iterable by sober hands, and a standing part of Philosophy. Many wise Divines hold a reality in the wonders of the Aegyptian Magicians, and that those <hi>magnalia</hi> which they performed before <hi>Pharaoh</hi> were not mere delusions of Sense. Rightly to understand how they made Serpents out of Rods; Froggs and Bloud of Water, were worth half <hi>Porta</hi>'s Magick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hermolaus Barbarus</hi> was scarce in his wits, when, upon conference with a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he would demand no other question than the explication of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s <hi>Entele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheia. Appion</hi> the Grammarian, that would raise the Ghost of <hi>Homer</hi> to decide the Controversie of his Country, made a fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous and pedantick use of Necromancy. <hi>Philostratus</hi> did as little, that call'd up the Ghost of <hi>Achilles</hi> for a particular of the Story of <hi>Troy.</hi> Smarter curiosities would have been at the great Elixir, the Flux and Reflux of the Sea, with other noble ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurities in Nature; but probably all in vain: in matters cognoscible and framed
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:41958:94"/>
for our disquisition, our Industry must be our Oracle, and Reason our <hi>Apollo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not to know things without the Arch of our intellectuals, or what Spirits appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, is the imperfection of our nature not our knowledge, and rather inscience than ignorance in man. Revelation might render a great part of the Creation easie which now seems beyond the stretch of humane indagation, and welcome no doubt from good hands might be a true <hi>Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest,</hi> and great celestial construction: a clear Systeme of the planetical Bodies of the invisible and seeming useless Stars un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, of the many Suns in the eighth Sphere, what they are, what they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and to what more immediately those stupendious Bodies are serviceable. But being not hinted in the authentick Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of God, nor known how far their discoveries are stinted; if they should come unto us from the mouth of evil Spirits, the belief thereof might be as unsafe as the enquiry.</p>

                  <p>That is, When that thriving Colony, which hath so much encreased in our days, and in the space of about fifty years, that they can, as they report, raise between twenty and thirty thousand men upon an exigency, shall in process of time be so advanced, as to be able to send forth Ships and Fleets, as to infest the American Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Ports and Maritime Dominions by depredations or assaults; for which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts they are not like to be unprovided, as abounding in the Materials for Shipping, Oak and Firre. And when length of time shall so far encrease that industrious people, that the neighbouring Country will not
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:41958:97"/>

And already in their infancy they have given testimony of their power and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in their bold attempts upon <hi>Campeche</hi> and <hi>Santa Martha;</hi> and in that notable attempt upon <hi>Panama</hi> on the Western side of <hi>America:</hi> especially considering this Island is sufficiently large to contain a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous people, of a Northern and warlike

                  <p>Of this we cannot be out of all fear: for, if the Turk should master <hi>Poland,</hi> he would be soon at this Sea. And from the odd constitution of the Polish Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the divisions among themselves, jealousies between their Kingdom and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick; vicinity of the Tartars, treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Cossacks, and the method of Turkish Policy, to be at Peace with the Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi> when he is at War with the Poles, there may be cause to fear that this may come to pass. And then he would soon endeavour to have Ports upon that Sea, as not wanting Materials for Shipping. And, having a new acquist of stout and warlike men, may be a terrour unto the confiners on that Sea, and to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which now conceive themselves safe from such an Enemy.</p>

But of late years, by the diligent enquiry of some Moscovites, a better discovery is made of these parts, and a Map or Chart made of them. Thereby <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> is found to be no Island extending very far Northward; but, winding Eastward, it joineth to the Tartarian Continent, and so makes a <hi>Peninsula:</hi> and the Sea between it which they entred at <hi>Waygatz,</hi> is found to be but a large Bay, apt to be frozen by
