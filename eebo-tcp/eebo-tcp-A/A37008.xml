            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PROLOGUE
TO A
Commonwealth of Women,
Spoke by Mr. HAYNES,
Habited like a WHIG, Captain of the
Scyth-men in the West, a Scythe in his
Hand.</head>
            <l>FROM the <hi>West,</hi> as Champion in defence of Wit,</l>
            <l>I come, to mow the Critticks of the Pit,</l>
            <l>Who think we've not improv'd what <hi>Fletcher</hi> Writ.</l>
            <l>This Godly Weapon first invented was</l>
            <l>By Whigs, to cut down Monarchy like Grass;</l>
            <l>But I know better how to use these Tools,</l>
            <l>And have reserv'd my Scythe to mow down Fools:</l>
            <l>Yet o' my Conscience they wou'd sprout again,</l>
            <l>And the <hi>Herculean</hi> Labour were in vain.</l>
            <l>The Pit, like <hi>Hydra</hi>'s, still wou'd yield supplies,</l>
            <l>From one lop't Block-head, twenty more would rise.</l>
            <l>A sort of paltry Critticks yonder sit,</l>
            <l>For this destroying Engine not unfit,</l>
            <l>Cuckolds were always Enemies to Wit;</l>
            <l>For Wit oft draws the Wife to leave her Spouse,</l>
            <l>To take a small refreshing bit with us.</l>
            <l>Phantastick Tastes how hard it is to please!</l>
            <l>Critticks, like Flyes, have several Species.</l>
            <l>There's one that just has paid his grutch'd half-Crown,</l>
            <l>Cries, Rot the Play, Pox on't, let's cry it down.</l>
            <l>The censuring Spark wou'd fain seem Great and Witty,</l>
            <l>Yet Whispers Politicks with Orange <hi>Betty;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>She cracks his Philberds, whilst he, in her Ear,</l>
            <l>Is Fighting o're again the Western War,</l>
            <l>Bragging what numbers his sole Arm has kill'd,</l>
            <l>Tho' the vain Fop perhaps was ne're i'th' Field.</l>
            <l>Thus Worm that snugs in Shell where it was bred,</l>
            <l>Is nothing to the Maggot in his head,</l>
            <l>For Harmless Insect that those Nuts create</l>
            <l>Is nothing to the Maggot of the Pate,</l>
            <l>Now such a Fop as this wou'd I be at.</l>
            <l>Another to compleat his daily Task,</l>
            <l>Fluster'd with Claret, seizes on a Mask,</l>
            <l>Hisses the Play, steals off with Punk i'th' dark,</l>
            <l>He Damns the Poet, but she Claps the Spark.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:43458:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I wonder if the Law cou'd doom one dead,</l>
            <l>That now should lop off such a Fellow's Head!</l>
            <l>It cannot be found Murther.—And to share</l>
            <l>This dreadful Fate, You Critticks all prepare.</l>
            <l>For besides all my Scythians yet unseen,</l>
            <l>We've yet a Female Common-wealth within,</l>
            <l>Who strongly Arm'd, like Furies venture on,</l>
            <l>And if y'approach their Trenches once, y'are gone.</l>

            <head>EPILOGUE.</head>
            <l>HOW silly 'tis for one, not yet Thirteen,</l>
            <l>To hope her first Essay should please you Men:</l>
            <l>You cannot taste what such a Creature speaks;</l>
            <l>Would she were three years older for your sakes;</l>
            <l>Two handfuls taller, a Plump pretty Lass,</l>
            <l>I doubt not then my Epilogue would pass.</l>
            <l>But, as I am, for your Applause I sue,</l>
            <l>Pray spare me for the Good that I may do.</l>
            <l>Gallants, I better shall perform e're long,</l>
            <l>Despise not a poor thing because she's young.</l>
            <l>Twigs may be bent, Trees are too stubborn grown;</l>
            <l>And th' Roses Bud is sweet as Roses blown.</l>
            <l>In <hi>China</hi> (as I often have been told)</l>
            <l>The Women marry at eleven years old:</l>
            <l>Our Play-House is a kind of <hi>China</hi> too,</l>
            <l>And nothing like the Stage to make me grow;</l>
            <l>For, tho' not Power, I have the Will to please,</l>
            <l>And Will's a mighty help in such a Case.</l>
            <l>We on this fruitful Soyl have Women seen,</l>
            <l>That in few Months have grown as big agen.</l>
            <l>Oh Iemminy! what is the Cause of that?</l>
            <l>I wonder what they Eat to grow so Fat?</l>
            <l>We young ones know not how that business is;</l>
            <l>But for all that we may be allow'd to guess;</l>
            <l>And I beginning now to chatter Sence,</l>
            <l>Encourag'd, may divert a Twelve-month hence:</l>
            <l>And therefore humbly thus I make Address,</l>
            <l>Excuse Faults, and accept my Will to please;</l>
            <l>But if you fail me, may you nevermore</l>
