            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> may wonder to ſee me in Print, thrice upon one Subject, and queſtion me, why not all at once, as well as to feed you with theſe farther Expectances? Reader, I muſt give you this for an Anſwer; diſeaſed Minds are like ſickly Bodies; if you give them not Preparatives, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper and the Application together may ruine the Patient: But to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you, <hi>Britannia</hi> begins to mend, and in a little time 'tis to be hoped will be in her right Wits again: eſpecially,
<pb facs="tcp:97448:3"/>
ſince ſhe is ſo much abated of her too credulous Opinions, and finds by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the dictates of her own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience runs counter to what ſhe has been, as it were, forced to believe from the mouths of her Diſſenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. There were many Symptoms of this craz'd Diſtemper, appearing long before theſe ſullen humours broke forth, which were diſcernable by the foulneſs of her Stomach, and her continual vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting of Gall and Sedition againſt the Government: And even then the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper run ſo high, it ſeem'd the Seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to Helliſh Plots, and Mother to Rebellion: And then ſhe brought forth, and put out to Nurſe this mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Opinion, <hi>That the Duke was a Papiſt</hi> (when he was praiſing God in the Boſom of our Church, and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb facs="tcp:97448:3"/>

            <head>CLARIOR E TENEBRIS.</head>
            <p>I Have not as yet been convinced of the leaſt miſtake in writing thoſe <hi>two Books,</hi> in the Title mentioned: tho' the <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> and <hi>Malecontents</hi> almoſt dayly print their Sophiſms and falſe Maxims, by which they would induce the credulous to a belief, <hi>that his Royal Highneſs is a Roman Catholick:</hi> But what they write, has no other Warrant than what proceeds from <hi>themſelves;</hi> an Argument too inconſiderable to prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Truth, and as eaſily baffled, as the reſt of their nonſenſical Opinions. Neither have I received any probable contradiction, but inſtead of Arguments, have had bitter Railings and Revilings, and am my ſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed to be <hi>a Papiſt</hi> (though of no other Communion than that of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) by thoſe who are moſt malitious againſt the Duke, for endeavouring to clear him of that aſperſion, and for admoniſhing thoſe that are Papiſts, to return to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97448:5"/>
of the King, and to be humbled for thoſe of their Perſwaſion, who have made ſuch bold attempts upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; a Teſt that may eaſily be taken, and ſave them from the danger that may enſue, by reaſon of ſuch wicked devices, which are not only ſinful in themſelves, but teach others (who watch every opportunity to invade the Government) to rebel; an example of which we lately had in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which put that Kingdom into a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, and was the occaſion of the King's ſending an Army under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> to quell that unnatural Rebellion. Neither do we want Examples at home, of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when Badges and Diſtinctions were given for the Parties to be known by; Traiterous Aſſociations, framed Libels of the moſt ſcandalous nature diſperſed, and the Government environ'd by thoſe who hate and do all they can to deſtroy it: And we are at this time to bleſs God, for giving the King Wiſdom and Courage to prevent an open Rebellion, that was ſo unluckily hatch'd, and ſo traiterouſly nouriſh'd, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97448:5"/>
it did, as it were, threaten and deſtroy at the ſame time, and made it manifeſt, that God was on our ſide, or it could not have been prevented.</p>
            <p>Now ſince the Roman Catholicks have of late ſo much diſorder'd our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by endeavouring to ſupplant it, and open'd a door by which other Sectaries and Enemies to the King have been let in, to trample upon the Flowers of the Crown, and to prophane our holy things, I did think my ſelf obliged in Duty and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to print the Book call'd <hi>The Grand Inqueſt,</hi> &amp;c. 1680. And the Book call'd <hi>The Royal Favourite Clear'd,</hi> &amp;c. 1682. Wherein I do aſſert, that there has not been any reaſonable Arguments offer'd, by which it may be prov'd, <hi>That his Royal Highneſs is a Roman Catholick:</hi> and therefore it muſt rationally be conjectured, that all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and Scandals that have been caſt upon him, as ſuch, were more to ſerve the wicked deſigns of his enemies upon the King and Government, than any real belief they had of his being <hi>a Papiſt:</hi> eſpecially, ſince neither the Roman Catholick nor Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97448:6"/>
have to this day one word to juſtifie themſelves, in what they have ſo boldly and ſo vainly inſinuated into the credulous Multitude.</p>
            <p>Therefore in purſuance of this Diſcourſe, I ſhall obſerve to you.</p>
            <p>Firſt, What they ſeem to aim at, who deſire and wiſh, that his Royal Highneſs were <hi>a Papist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, What they deſign, who would ſtigmatize the Duke with the name of <hi>Papiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, What they would be at, that only fear him to be ſo?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, What they aim at, who cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit the Duke with their beſt belief, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his many ſufferings, by reaſon of the extream malice of wicked men.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, Thoſe who wiſh the Duke <hi>a Papiſt,</hi> muſt at the ſame time expreſs Zeal for God, wiſh the Converſion of Hereticks, and the good of the Land: But, that all this is only pretended, is plainly to be demonſtrated, ſince the ways they go about to effect their deſigns, have been by Plots, dark Intrigues, Lyings, Perjuries, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97448:6"/>
Treaſons; and God, nor can, nor will, require theſe things at their hands: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be their wicked <hi>Mammon</hi> that incites them to it, that ſo they may regain their long wiſh'd for and ill gotten Lands, with many other unlawful and tyrannical Advantages, with which they did former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppreſs theſe Nations, curb our Kings, and miſerably drain the Purſes of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, making St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Net a Drag to take Gold; not Souls; and his Key to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock the Door of their Treaſure, not that of their Hearts; in fine, they have ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized themſelves to the World, by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious marks of Pride, Covetouſneſs, and Letchery, which will be ever handed down to ſucceeding Ages, by the ſtill mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Examples of their lazy Monks, Friers, and the reſt of that Idolatrous Crew: Therefore it muſt be a pretended, or at leaſt, a miſguided Zeal in them, who do believe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or endeavour to perſwade the World, <hi>That his Royal Highneſs is a Papiſt;</hi> that ſo they may have a better colour to perform what they go about, and make his Innocence, Juſtice and Valour, a Cloak
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97448:7"/>
for their Wickedneſs, and as it were, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their Crimes by counterfeiting his Name, as a Party to their Black and Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Contrivances. So fond are wicked men to have their Iniquity believed to be none, that if they can but pretend to have perſwaded the juſt into their Opinion, even they themſelves begin to think they have done no harm.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What they deſign, who would ſtigmatize the Duke with the name of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,</hi> is obvious in the Fanatick, who, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd with the Papiſt, endeavour to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the ſame thing, tho' with different Ends. The Jeſuit makes uſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick, as the Ape did of the Cats Foot; only, with this difference, the Fanatick was willing to be made uſe of, though it were with the hazard of burning, hoping, at laſt, to deceive the cunning of him, who expoſed him; and ſo the Jeſuit, who had laid the Snare, was to be taken in his own Gin, together with what he moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to deſtroy <hi>(viz.) The preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:</hi> And this <hi>Jack Presbyter</hi> zealouſly concluded would ſet Whiggery on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97448:7"/>
make Kings Elective, or bring forth <hi>their great</hi> Diana <hi>a Common-wealth,</hi> whoſe practice is to imbrue their Hands in the Blood of Kings, Prieſts and Nobles, that they may once more enjoy their Dignities and Eſtates and ſecure to themſelves, thoſe Poſſeſſions by a more durable Tyranny. For that reaſon, like eager Hounds, they purſue the Duke, and are ready with like Numbers to vote him <hi>a Papiſt,</hi> tho' a Proteſtant `as to exclude him from the Succeſſion, tho' <hi>Brother to the King;</hi> by which aſſociating Principle they ſeem to reſemble the <hi>Guiſe Faction,</hi> who, by the hand of <hi>Clement</hi> the Monk, murthered <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Third of <hi>France,</hi> for being a Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor of the Roman Faith, tho' he lived and died a zealous Roman Catholick; as <hi>Davila</hi> does at large recite in his Hiſtory of the Civil Wars of <hi>France.</hi> But what need we croſs the Seas, when we have a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick and more recent Example, that is able to convince the worſt of men, in the death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt of ever Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Memory, who died a Martyr for the Proteſtant Religion? And yet by our <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanteers,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:97448:8"/>
(who may be ſaid to be the Spawn of that Holy League) he was branded with the Name of <hi>Papiſt:</hi> Inſtances ſo pat and ſuitable to my purpoſe, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be paſſed over without a particular Remarque. In vain therefore do thoſe perſons, who would ſtigmatize the Duke with the Name of Papiſt, plead Statutes and Laws to ſtrengthen their Pretenſions, when Laws and Statutes will not ſpeak or act according to their crooked and obſcure Opinions: neither will their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Numbers be able to juſtifie them in the ſight of God or Men.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What they would be at, who fear the Duke to be a <hi>Papiſt:</hi> Truly, it is a very hard matter to gueſs at the meaning of their Fears, unleſs, it be ſuppoſed like Foxes, they take their Ears for Horns, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will run with the Cornuted Company, thinking to find more ſafety from them, than under the Protection of the Noble Lion, who ſeem'd to have baniſh'd thoſe only that bore Arms againſt him.</p>
            <p>Will any believe the cunning Papiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſcandalous Fanatick, or the malicious

diſcontented States-man? then let them cry, as they do, the Duke is <hi>a Papiſt,</hi> the King is <hi>Popiſhly affected, and ſo</hi> are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and Gentry, and that Popery and Tyranny are coming in as a Torrent; but let theſe men conſider, they ought to be eſteemed the greateſt Plague of a Nation, and to be moſt ſeverely dealt with, who are ſuch Weather-Cocks, that will turn with every Wind, and give credit to ſuch diſcontented Parties, that never think they are doing their Duty, if they are not lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pooning the Government, aſperſing the King, the Royal Family, and their beſt Friends; nay more, aſſociating and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving how to give Law to their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours; tearing and rending from the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, what ſhould ſupport the Crown in its due Glory and Splendor, and keep them in their Allegiance.</p>
            <p>Again, Have any received juſt Fears and Suſpitions of the Duke's being <hi>a Papiſt?</hi> if they have, yet, ſtill they are but Fears and Suſpitions, and are to be corrected, if they will hearken to the King, who ſpeaks o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe in his Speech to his Parliament,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97448:9"/>
on the <hi>6th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> in the <hi>31ſt.</hi> year of his Reign; and to two Acts of Parliament, the one made 25. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. the other 30. <hi>Car</hi> 2. which likewiſe ſay otherways; ſo do the <hi>Scotch</hi> Clergy and Nation (who are as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle addicted to Popery as <hi>England</hi> is) wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Letter from thence, directed to his Grace the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> from <hi>Edenburgh</hi> the <hi>9th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> 1682. So do our Univerſities, and ſo do all thoſe that ſeek Peace and Truth: and whatever the Fears of theſe men are, yet 'tis to be hoped, that this Truth will ſtill prevail, in ſpite of all its Oppoſers; and then thoſe wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Creatures, that run ſcreaming about, and know not what they would have, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fill'd with Fears and Jealouſies, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, may be ſome of them, that aim at <hi>a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Pardon;</hi> and ſo render the late Plots (as much as in them lies) ridiculous, by ſuch a Solicitation, wherein their own Fears are as demonſtrable, as the others Crimes, and in the Croud, tho' guilty, they may paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way undiſcerned, leaving the Taint upon thoſe who remain ſqualling behind.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, What they aim at, who credit
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97448:9"/>
the Duke with their beſt belief, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his many ſufferings, by reaſon of the unparalled malice of wicked men, muſt, I hope, at this time of the day, be eſteem'd Generous, and extreamly for the eſtabliſhment of Religion and Loyalty; and if their numbers be ſmall, yet, that with the bleſſing of God, muſt be lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to exceed the Numbers of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; for, if God be for them, who can be againſt them?</p>
            <p>And if the Duke do not appear publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at our Churches, it muſt be thought to take off a Calumny, that otherwiſe would have been caſt even upon the Church it ſelf, by thoſe, who have been ſo lately ripe for Rebellion, and would therefore have call'd our Clergy, Romiſh Prieſts; and our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice Book, the Maſs, as they have call'd the Duke Roman Catholick; and this is plain, ſince they have already declared our Miniſtry and Gentry Popiſhly affected; and branded them with the ignominious Names of the Dead Weight, <hi>French</hi> Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, and Betrayers of their King and Country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:97448:10"/>And (ſpeaking after the manner of Men) could they then have hearded the Duke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Clergy, who, like the blown Deer, was pitied, but could not be aſſiſted by his Companions, theſe cruel and Blood-thirſty men, would have worri'd the whole Flock of Chriſt, and made it ere this, a Prey to the moſt Barbarous People that were ever ſeen upon the face of the Earth.</p>
            <p>But (ſpeaking after the manner of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels) Chriſt has ſaid, his Church is built upon a Rock, and that it ſhall never be deſtroyed: And therefore, we ought not to trim the Buſineſs, who profeſs faith in Chriſt, and good-will towards men, leſt it prove worſe with us, who have enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel above 1500 years, than with <hi>Peter,</hi> who curs'd and ſwore, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the High Prieſt's Hall, deny'd his Maſter: or with thoſe, who, to this day, uſurp St. <hi>Peters</hi> Chair, yet, ſtill lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Reproach of excluding <hi>the Faith,</hi> and making <hi>Good Works</hi> the only way to Heaven.</p>
            <p>But, by the Wiſdom of our Governors, the Meaſures of our implacable Enemies
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97448:10"/>
are broken: and (thanks be to God) there is now no danger of <hi>Spaniſh Pilgrims, French Invaſions, Romiſh Prieſts, or Geneva Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi> Nor of any that are ſo malitious and baſe, as to detract from the Honour of the King, and his Miniſters of State, which gives me a Remarque of the Grandeur and Stability of our Government, when thoſe who ſtand at the Helm, are able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand (through Generoſity and Courage) the Calumnies and Slanders of their Enemies; and by true Rules of Vertue, render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as it were, <hi>Tempeſt Proof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet, to prevent the Inconveniencies that may ariſe hereafter, by the Ignorance of ſimple People, who of late run too much after <hi>State Quacks,</hi> upon the leaſt motion of the Government, fearing it ſhould lean to Popery or Tyranny: I ſay, when any ſuch popular Diſtemper ſhall happen, and the Nation ſtand in abſolute need of a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, I queſtion not, but theſe ſeveral Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications will be as well, if not better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of; ſince the nature of the Diſeaſe, which tends only to Faction and Sedition, will be ſo well known, that ſcarce one in
<pb facs="tcp:97448:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:97448:12"/>
the whole Colledge of our wiſe Phyſicians, but will eaſily apprehend it.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavour'd to ſtrengthen <hi>my former Impreſſions,</hi> with ſuch farther Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as I did not think fit to make uſe of in thoſe Times, leſt, by endeavouring to ſupport, I might have contributed to the diſadvantage of his Royal Highneſs, whoſe Wiſdom ſeems to be like that of <hi>Noah,</hi> who, after the Flood began to abate, did not preſently open the Gates of his Ark, but at a Window ſent forth a Dove, that brought him back an Olive Branch, by which he had hopes the Deluge was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into its proper place and boundary; and after that, he ſent out a ſecond, that never returned again; which gave him aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance the Inſurrection of the ſurly Waves was appeaſed: And ſometime after that, he uncovered the Ark, and then the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens were clear, and the Earth, as when created, ſeem'd to rejoyce; and God ſpake to him to come forth, which he no ſooner did, than immediately he was ſeen to be upon his Knees, praiſing God, and built an Altar, on which he ſacrificed, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97448:12"/>
with which God was well pleaſed, and ſaid in his heart, he would not curſe the Ground any more for his ſake.</p>
            <p>And now laſtly, for my ſelf, who have undertaken theſe Diſcourſes, under the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt circumſtances imaginable (having none to encourage me but my own Obſervations, and thoſe, when ever argued, oppoſed by the Multitude, with the greateſt Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnings and Malice, that miſguided Zeal could invent) tho' Ignorance and Malice may ſit upon, and cenſure this Treatiſe for a Time, yet I have ſufficient hopes, God will put it forth (at one time or other) with the Comment of my honeſt meaning upon it, not tortured, and wire-drawn with falſe or Ignoramus Expoſitions: And in the mean time, I hope wiſe men will take me into their ſerious conſideration, and conclude what I have wrote is my real Opinion, not biaſſed with Flattery, as ſome ſay, or clogg'd with hopes of Preferment, as others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; and then, what the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or Roundheaded Whigs ſhall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of me, whether as a Papiſt, for juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Duke, or an ill manager of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97448:13"/>
my Pen, I ſhall not matter either, or all of their Condemnations, ſince I ſee before me the whole frame of their Proceedings, to be as it were, but <hi>one grand Miſtake,</hi> and their Counſels to be deſpiſed and rejected, like that of <hi>Achitophels;</hi> but as a man, I wiſh them not the ſame Fate, and as a Chriſtian, I hope they may live to make amends, or at leaſt, repent of their Contrivances, that ſo we may at laſt ſee our weather-beaten Government freed from thoſe Storms and Tempeſt that were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to overwhelm it, and unanimouſly magnifie our God, who hath brought us into a ſafe Harbour, maugre all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of outragious and blood-thirſty men.</p>
            <p>And now, having no more to ſay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Subject, other, than that no man is infallible in his Opinion, I ſhall hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg, that I may be received by the kind Reader, with that candor, as every one would expect to be dealt with in the like nature. And (that every one laying his hand upon his Breaſt) would not obſtinately disbelieve his Friend, when in his own Conſcience he cannot find
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97448:13"/>
any thing to oppoſe him, even in his moſt ſecret thoughts.</p>
            <p>Withal, I am not a little anxious, to think that theſe Diſcourſes may ſeem pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious by ſome, as well as prejudicial by others, to the intereſt of his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but it is impoſſible to pleaſe all, or to eſcape without cenſure in this detracting Age, tho' our Actions were regulated by the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Reaſon. Yet what <hi>I</hi> have ſaid, carries the face of ſo much Juſtice and Honeſty, that <hi>I</hi> would not change my Opinion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out greater Demonſtrations than <hi>I</hi> have yet had to the contrary: however, were <hi>I</hi> obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to believe that the Duke is a Papiſt (which no man yet has ſufficient grounds to think) <hi>I</hi> hope, <hi>I</hi> am ſo well ſatisfyed in the exerciſe of our Proteſtant Religion, that <hi>I</hi> would do every thing becoming an honeſt man and a good Chriſtian; and then <hi>I</hi> am ſure <hi>I</hi> ſhould never do evil, that good might come of it; which Obſervation <hi>I</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend more particularly to thoſe, who are ſo fond of the Bill of Excluſion.</p>
