            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

§. I Begin with the <hi>firſt, what ground there is in this life,</hi> to cauſe us to rejoyce in ſuch tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This, in the. 3. and 4. verſes. <hi>[Knowing]</hi> that is deeply conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and weighing <hi>this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> of our Chriſtian profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>the trying of your faith works Patience.</hi> That's one and the <hi>firſt.</hi> In which, the Apoſtle <hi>tacitely</hi> ſuppoſeth <hi>this maxime,</hi> and builds upon the ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it; it lyes at the bottom, and yet is enough implyed.

            </p>
            <p>That <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>bottom Ground,</hi> is evident: For why elſe ſhould he propoſe and hold forth <hi>this,</hi> of all <hi>other,</hi> with a <hi>[For]</hi> or

               <hi>Particle</hi> that gives the <hi>reaſon,</hi> of what he had now ſaid?

And therefore when Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als come, we are to think with our ſelves, <hi>now,</hi> will my graces be tryed; <hi>now,</hi> is that befal'n me which will do it: this ought to be matter of the <hi>greateſt joy to me.</hi> For from this <hi>Ground,</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> it is, that the Apoſtle bids them <hi>Count it all</hi>

               <hi>joy.</hi> And <hi>hereupon</hi> it is, (for no other doth he mention here) this alone being the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that a Chriſtian is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, <hi>in this life:</hi> And in <hi>this life,</hi> only it is, that <hi>Grace is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of it lyes in <hi>this,</hi> that <hi>for Grace to approve it ſelf to God</hi> in a <hi>way of the greateſt well-pleaſing to him;</hi> and ſo as to come to be <hi>approved of by God.</hi> And for a mans <hi>ſincerity,</hi> to have Gods approbation and <hi>teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial,</hi> as to <hi>Abraham, now I know thou feareſt me; This</hi> is the <hi>greateſt priviledge,</hi> a Saint can have: and <hi>this</hi> ought to be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the greateſt comfort.

leſſon <hi>out of the rode,</hi> utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth, and extravagant; He muſt goe to ſchoole therefore to <hi>learn</hi> this: For ſo that text im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes, <hi>this</hi> he was to <hi>learn,</hi> as that which would <hi>perfect</hi> him, above all. And ſo indeed to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it follows in the 9. ver. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made perfect,</hi> that is by <hi>what</hi> he <hi>ſuffered</hi> (as in the verſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and chap. 2. He had alſo ſaid.) And as that which did <hi>perfect</hi> him, more then all his <hi>other obedience,</hi> and rendred him more <hi>acceptable</hi> to his Father: Now it was his <hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during,</hi> wherein, <hi>that</hi> his <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> Principally lay: which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly is ſo often ſpoken of him, as Heb. 12. 2, 3. <hi>He endured the Croſs,</hi> and v. 2. <hi>He endured ſuch contradictions of ſinners,</hi> v. 3. the ſame <hi>word</hi> that here is uſed for <hi>Patience:</hi> that the <hi>Verb,</hi> this the <hi>Nown.

uſed up and down the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and in this Epiſtle moſt, to expreſs <hi>Patience</hi> by, as chap. 1. v. 12. chap. 5. v. 8, 10, 11. Now Chriſt did ſo <hi>endure. He was led as a ſheep to the ſlaughter, he opened not his mouth.</hi> Hogs cry, but ſheep make no <hi>din,</hi> when led to the ſlaughter; or when their throats are cut. And this was Chriſts <hi>Proper,</hi> and <hi>Super per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> who is therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as an example of <hi>ſuffering</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> to us, and likewiſe of that <hi>glorious end</hi> and <hi>iſſue,</hi> of it, in theſe words of that chap. 5. 11. <hi>Ye have heard of the patience of</hi> Job. <hi>[And you have ſeen the end of the Lord]</hi> namely of the Lord CHRIST.

was the END of our <hi>Lord,</hi> and his <hi>ſufferings,</hi> which made him <hi>perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as it was Jeſus Chriſts perfection, ſo it was of the moſt eminent Saints. Look again into this Epiſtle, chap. 5. v. 11. and you find the primitive princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that was in <hi>Vogue</hi> to be, <hi>[Behold we count them happy which endure]</hi> (it is ſtill the ſame word which is uſed for <hi>Patience,</hi> as was ſaid) that is, <hi>we</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans generally eſteem them the happieſt men in the world, that are moſt exerciſed with ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and armed with patience to endure them.

He ſets <hi>the Crown</hi> upon the head of that Grace: Nor doth he mention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the good they had done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nothing of <hi>that,</hi> but their <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi> only.

                  <p>My Brethren, the <hi>love of God</hi> brought in by Faith, will help a man to <hi>bear up</hi> under any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You know that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. He had triumphed in the love of God, v. 31. <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us?</hi>

Fourthly, <hi>Faith</hi> tells us <hi>that there will be a good iſſue of all, as to the other world;</hi> yea and in this world alſo, in ſuch things that relate to that World. <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 18, 19.

I Give theſe Anſwers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>object</hi> of your joy is not ſimply <hi>your afflictions:</hi> No, no man can delight in them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, <hi>they</hi> (indeed) <hi>are grievous,</hi> as ſaith the Apoſtle. But <hi>your</hi> joy lyes in <hi>looking unto,</hi> what is the <hi>iſſue</hi> and <hi>event,</hi> the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>reward</hi> of your Tryals by them; and <hi>that is it</hi> you are to <hi>Count</hi> the <hi>matter</hi> of your joy, and <hi>ALL IOY.</hi> To rejoyce in the <hi>thing,</hi> or the affliction it ſelf, is one thing: And to rejoyce in the <hi>expectation</hi> of the <hi>event</hi> and <hi>iſſue,</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Then Secondly, If you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, the word in the Text is favourable: Says he <hi>[Count] it all joy;</hi> that is, <hi>eſteem</hi> it ſo. He doth not ſay, you ſhall <hi>have all joy</hi> (at preſent); But though you have not, you may <hi>count it all joy,</hi> that is, you may reckon it <hi>[as matter of all joy,]</hi> as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Interpreters par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

words, and ſo <hi>Reaſon</hi> yourſelves into joy in your <hi>Judgements,</hi> and ſo eſteem it all joy, <hi>Appretia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè,</hi> as the School ſpeaks: though the paſſion of joy be wanting.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, when he did <hi>endure the Croſs,</hi> and whilſt he hung upon it, and likewiſe <hi>afore,</hi> whilſt within the <hi>Garden,</hi> he was not in a joyous frame of Spirit, at that preſent, as to <hi>the paſſion of joy;</hi> nay, <hi>his Soul was heavy unto death,</hi> that while: Yet it is ſaid, Heb. 12. 1. <hi>THAT FOR THE JOY that was ſet before him he did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Croſs, &amp;c.</hi> And he therein is ſet forth as an <hi>example unto us,</hi> in the ſame verſe, <hi>Let us run [WITH PATIENCE] the race that is ſet before us, Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi> It is well, if you <hi>look to the joy ſet before you,</hi> as that which you certainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to come, although you want
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:109019:64"/>
the Paſſion of <hi>joy</hi> in that which you expect to come.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, You may perhaps not rejoyce at <hi>preſent with great joy,</hi> yet <hi>afterwards</hi> through much exerciſe of <hi>Patience</hi> it may <hi>grow up</hi> in you. And this <hi>anſwer,</hi> the Apoſtle himſelf gives in that Heb. 12. Diſtinguiſhing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>what</hi> for [the <hi>preſent,]</hi> and what for <hi>[afterwards,]</hi> in time, v. 11. <hi>Now no Chaſtning [for the preſent] ſeemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheleſs</hi> [after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards] <hi>it yieldeth the peaceable fruits of Righteouſneſs unto them [which are exerciſed] thereby:</hi> And upon the hopes of that, he bids them <hi>to lift up the hands that hang down, and ſtrengthen the feeble knees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet, Fifthly, Some <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have had, and you <hi>may have actual joy at that preſent in the midſt of your afflictions.</hi> Theſe Two, <hi>great Tryals,</hi> and <hi>great</hi>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:109019:65"/>
                     <hi>Joyes,</hi> may well meet and ſtand together, in the heart at once, as in divers reſpects: For the Apoſtle hath reconciled thoſe two, 1 Pet. 1. 6. <hi>Wherein ye [greatly rejoyce,] though [Now] for a ſeaſon (if need be) ye are in heavineſs through manifold tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations.</hi> That ſpeech <hi>[wherein ye greatly rejoyce]</hi> reacheth and <hi>riſeth</hi> higher then to an account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it <hi>matter</hi> of joy, about what is to come; but doth further ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, ſpeak of joy for the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi> And therefore to have the <hi>affection of inward joy</hi> it ſelf greatly raiſed up; and yet at that inſtant, in the ſame <hi>[Now]</hi> as he ſpeaks, in <hi>outward</hi> reſpects, <hi>to be in heavineſs,</hi> are compatible. And 1 Col. 11. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>ſuch a glorious power,</hi> accompanying the Saints in try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, as ſhall work <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Long-ſuffering with JOYF<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS:</hi> And why elſe doth the

Apoſtle, alſo ſay, <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord alwayes, and again I ſay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</hi> He contents not himſelf to have ſaid it <hi>once,</hi> as if to have them rejoyce, a little; but he profeſſeth to ſay it <hi>again,</hi> becauſe they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce abundantly; and this <hi>[al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways]</hi> and therefore in all <hi>times</hi> and in <hi>all conditions.</hi> Of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence of which two himſelf propoſeth himſelf an example: <hi>As ſorrowful, yet alwayes Rejoycing.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Patience</hi> is then <hi>perfect, when it continues to the end.</hi> As a <hi>Colour</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>perfect,</hi> when 'tis <hi>Durable,</hi> as a <hi>Dye in grain;</hi> or as the <hi>Indy</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which while the cloth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, they <hi>END<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE.</hi> Now it is <hi>he that endures to the end,</hi> Math. 24. <hi>that ſhall be ſaved.</hi> You ſhall therefore find that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>LONG-S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>FFERING, Patience</hi> is added in two ſeveral places, 1 Col. <hi>Strengthened unto all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> and <hi>LONG-S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>FFERING.

To carry a <hi>great burden a quarter</hi> of an hour is an effect of ſome patience; but to carry it a <hi>day,</hi> or more, or for <hi>a week,</hi> there is <hi>long-ſuffering?</hi> Why is it ſaid, that <hi>When you have done the will of God, you have need of Patience:</hi> but becauſe, ſtill, in the <hi>laſt part of</hi> your life, after an <hi>active life</hi> for a long while ran through, even then when you are near <hi>the promiſe,</hi> your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may be then at laſt, moſt of all put to it.</p>

§.</p>
                  <p>A third <hi>Property</hi> or <hi>requiſite</hi> to <hi>perfect Patience,</hi> is, that it be <hi>univerſal;</hi> which is either, when a man hath been <hi>every way tryed,</hi> and hath paſt thorow all ſorts of Tentations: Or when he hath ſtill come off with <hi>Patience in</hi> ſome good meaſure, in <hi>all</hi> thoſe, wherein he hath been tryed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his tryals have not been of all ſorts. A mans natural Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will help him to be patient in <hi>ſome things,</hi> but in <hi>other</hi> things his heart is weak, and cannot bear; Oh not ſuch ſuch a <hi>Croſs,</hi> of any other. But it is certain, As GOD tried <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in his <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſo GOD will the <hi>Sons of Abraham,</hi> in what is <hi>deareſt to them:</hi> and yet enable them to bear it, (as I <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.) and goe thorow therewith. Hence in the Epiſtles you meet with <hi>[ALL]</hi> added to <hi>Patience,</hi>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:109019:69"/>
and <hi>long-ſuffering,</hi> both when Patience is <hi>prayed for,</hi> as 1 Col. and <hi>exhorted unto,</hi> as 2 Tim. 4. 2. But though this <hi>univerſality</hi> is to be prayed for, and exhorted unto, as that which makes it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; yet it is well, if in the great trials of our Lives, we come off with <hi>ſome Patience ſutable;</hi> and from henceforth reſolve with endurance ſo to do; and ſo much is expected: And it may ſeem ſtrange, that many that ſhould be able to bear great trials between GOD and them, with much quietneſs and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, are yet eaſily diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged, upon ſmaller occaſions between <hi>men and them:</hi> For which ſome reaſons might be given.</p>

                  <head>I. To the Diſcouragement,</head>
                  <p>§. THe opening of theſe words <hi>[If any of you lack Wiſdom]</hi> will greatly conduce to eaſe your heart as to <hi>that:</hi> The effect of which, is, that the Apoſtle plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſeth, <hi>that true believers</hi> may both, <hi>really,</hi> and in their <hi>own apprehenſions</hi> eſpecially, be <hi>found greatly lacking in point of Patience when Trials doe befall them.</hi> And this I am ſure hath reaſon to relieve you in what is like to be the great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that uſually falls out.</p>
                  <p>This to be the <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> of the Apoſtle, is made good by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening four things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That by <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> here, is
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:109019:71"/>
plainly meant <hi>Patience;</hi> together with the <hi>perfect Work</hi> of it, which he had ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he ſpeaks this unto thoſe <hi>that</hi> were <hi>true believers. [If any of [You.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. How it may or can be ſaid, that true believers, who <hi>have all Grace</hi> and the principles thereof in them, to <hi>lack</hi> ſuch or ſuch a grace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The intimate reaſon and occaſion, upon which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle utters himſelf in this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>[If any, &amp;c.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. For the firſt, <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is taken <hi>largely</hi> for all <hi>Grace</hi> and gracious actings, <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever:</hi> Sometimes <hi>ſtrictly</hi> for a <hi>particular Grace.</hi> To find out the difference of which, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is to be taken from the <hi>ſcope of the place,</hi> where either of theſe is mentioned. Now <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:109019:72"/>
in this place, is to be taken <hi>ſtrictly,</hi> that is, for that <hi>particular Grace,</hi> or piece of gracious <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> whereby to <hi>know how to be able to manage a mans ſelf under Trials, eſpecially great, ſore</hi> and <hi>ſudden ones, Patiently:</hi> (which is done when we have taken in, and digeſted by Faith, ſuch <hi>principles</hi> as our Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affords (plenty of) as <hi>grounds,</hi> that inſtruct, and enable the Soul, joyfully to entertain ſuch Trials and Tentations, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and goe thorow them, with a conſtancy of joy). For look as the word <hi>[Grace]</hi> is taken, either <hi>ſtrictly</hi> or <hi>largly,</hi> that is either for <hi>all Grace,</hi> and yet again for <hi>any</hi> or every <hi>particular Grace,</hi> each of which are called <hi>Grace</hi> alſo: <hi>As ye abound in every Grace, ſo ye abound in [this Grace alſo].</hi> Thus, All <hi>Grace</hi> is called <hi>Wiſdom</hi> in a <hi>large</hi> ſenſe, (as uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly throughout the Book of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs,)
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:109019:72"/>
But withal, a <hi>particular Grace</hi> is called <hi>Wiſdom</hi> too, as the third Chapter of this Epiſtle, ver. 13. ſhews. The <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>meekneſs,</hi> ſhewn in <hi>ſpeech,</hi> and <hi>converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> he ſtiles it <hi>[meekneſs of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom]</hi> or a <hi>wiſe meekneſs,</hi> or a <hi>meekneſs</hi> accompanied with, and proceeding out of wiſdom. And thus <hi>Calvin,</hi> and moſt others, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sapientiae</hi> nomen ad circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentis Loci reſtringo. <hi>Calvin</hi> in Verb.</note> 
                     <hi>wiſdom,</hi> here, in this my Text, of this ſpecial Grace: The ſcope and coherence with the former words carrying it thereunto. <hi>True Patience</hi> being from ſuch a <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> as whereby the Soul hath the <hi>skil and ability to manage a mans ſelf patiently under Tentations,</hi> to ſuch an iſſue, as that Patience ſhould have a <hi>perfect work in us;</hi> and unto <hi>this,</hi> it is here to be reſtrained: For <hi>this Grace,</hi> it is, he had been, and ſtill is diſcourſing of.</p>
                  <p>And there is a <hi>ſpecial</hi> and more peculiar <hi>reaſon,</hi> why this skill
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:109019:73"/>
of <hi>Patience</hi> ſhould be <hi>ſtiled Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> in a more eminent ſenſe. For what he had before uttered of <hi>rejoycing</hi> in afflictions and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and exhorted unto, that <hi>Patience</hi> ſhould <hi>have it's perfect work;</hi> theſe things being the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt leſſons in <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> do there fore need and require the higheſt <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Divine Wiſdom,</hi> both <hi>Doctrinal</hi> and <hi>Practical,</hi> to be deeply inlayed and fixed in the Soul, <hi>ſo</hi> as to <hi>bow</hi> and frame the heart unto a real <hi>practice,</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> performance of ſuch <hi>Dictates,</hi> and <hi>conformity</hi> thereunto. For then it is that <hi>knowledge</hi> is tearmed <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> and for that reaſon it is, that our <hi>whole Religion</hi> is ſtiled <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> becauſe it reſts not in bare <hi>Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal knowledge,</hi> (which is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering thing from <hi>Wiſdom)</hi> but makes men <hi>proportionably</hi> wiſe, to the practiſe of the things, in which it inſtructs. And particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:109019:73"/>
this <hi>skill</hi> of <hi>renduring</hi> Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations (ſuch as hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed) doth deſerve this ſtile more eminently, for it ſo far out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies, and is above the ſphere of all Principles, whether of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,</hi> or what other profeſſion, or profeſſors of Patience what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, who whilſt in a <hi>ſullen Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> (for all of theirs was no better) they <hi>profeſſed to be wiſe, they became fooliſh:</hi> and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity infinitely out-ſhoots them in what they moſt gloried in.</p>
                  <p>§. Secondly, That he ſpeaks this to them whom he ſuppoſeth <hi>true Believers,</hi> and unto <hi>them as ſuch,</hi> is evident: Although at the firſt bluſh (as we ſay) the words would ſeem to poynt at and ſpeak to <hi>unregenerate men,</hi> who <hi>wholly want</hi> all true <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>grace:</hi> and ſo the drift ſhould be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Direction to,</hi> or <hi>for ſuch,</hi>
                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:109019:74"/>
to ſeek true Grace, which they lack, at the hands of God, by Prayer.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Coherence</hi> manifeſtly ſhews, that he ſpeaks to ſuch, whom he ſuppoſeth to be alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy true <hi>Believers:</hi> For in the next words, he exhorts the <hi>ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> whom he ſpeaks to in theſe words, to <hi>ask in Faith;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſeth <hi>them</hi> to have true Faith already, whom he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects this Exhortation unto. And otherwiſe it had been more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, yea requiſite to have exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>them</hi> (if he had intended it of <hi>unregenerate men,) firſt,</hi> to ſeek <hi>Faith it ſelf,</hi> and then <hi>out of Faith</hi> and <hi>in that Faith</hi> to ſeek for this <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> or Grace of <hi>endurance.</hi> And again he ſpeaks to <hi>them</hi> that were <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;</hi> ſo he calls them. And in this paſſage, ſays; <hi>if any of [YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>]</hi> and ſuch, who being true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſtianity were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:109019:74"/>
unto thoſe <hi>ſundry Tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> from perſecutions, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And 'tis <hi>ſuch,</hi> alſo whom he exhorts <hi>to count it all joy,</hi> &amp;c. and here to <hi>ask</hi> a <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of GOD, whereby to be able to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for their holy profeſſion. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, this <hi>Wiſdom</hi> lying in <hi>Patience having its perfect work</hi> in them, it ſuppoſeth the <hi>perſons ſuch,</hi> as had ſome <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and of other <hi>Graces</hi> begun in them already. And indeed, to have exhorted <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nregenerate Men,</hi> that were as yet utterly deſtitute of <hi>all Grace,</hi> and ſo out of harms way, as to any ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for the Goſpel; and to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> them to make this the <hi>firſt</hi> of their addreſſes to GOD, and of their requeſts, that they might be able to <hi>endure Tentations,</hi> and that <hi>Patience</hi> ſhould <hi>have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect work in them;</hi> and ſo to have taught them, <hi>that,</hi> which is the hardeſt leſſon in Chriſtianity, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:109019:75"/>
ere they had learnt the firſt letters thereof, <hi>this</hi> had been ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly improper, and a leſſon at too great a diſtance, for men in their <hi>Natural</hi> ſtate, <hi>firſt</hi> to <hi>learn.</hi> Thus much for the <hi>PERSONS,</hi> viz. That he ſpeaks it unto men already <hi>Regenerate,</hi> and ſuppoſed in <hi>the Faith.</hi>

                  <p>§. The third thing Propoſed, was, How it could be, he ſhould ſpeak in this manner of <hi>Believers, that they ſhould lack this Grace of Wiſdom;</hi> whenas, if ſuch, they muſt be ſuppoſed to have all <hi>true Graces</hi> in them: why then ſhould he yet ſay, even of them, <hi>If any of you Lack, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſwer, This expreſſion, to ſay, ſuch and ſuch a Chriſtian, <hi>[Lacks]</hi> ſuch or ſuch a Grace, is not uncouth, nor unuſual in the Scriptures; when <hi>he,</hi> (or <hi>they)</hi> have wanted the <hi>EXERCISE</hi>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:109019:75"/>
                     <hi>of it.</hi> For though Chriſtians doe receive the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>all Graces,</hi> as 2 Pet. 1. 3. yet they may neglect to <hi>ſtir up all</hi> graces, or may have been <hi>diſuſed</hi> to the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of <hi>ſome.</hi> Why elſe, and to what end doth the Apoſtle in the ſame place ſtir them up to <hi>add Grace to Grace,</hi> as in verſe 5. And in thoſe caſes, a Chriſtian may be ſaid, yea charged to <hi>lack</hi> that Grace or <hi>Graces,</hi> which he wants the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of. For ſo in the ſame Chapter, ver. 9. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a <hi>Dozed</hi> negligent profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, though <hi>true,</hi> he uſeth this very language of him, <hi>He that lacks theſe things</hi> (as I have elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where opened that Scripture); For <hi>Idem eſt non eſſe, et non uti:</hi> 'Tis all one for <hi>a thing not to be,</hi> and <hi>not to be uſed, when the being of a thing is wholly ordained for uſe</hi> and <hi>operation:</hi> Now ſuch a thing is <hi>Grace;</hi> and ſuch a thing if not <hi>uſed,</hi> is as if it <hi>were</hi>

                     <hi>not.</hi> And the oppoſition that is between <hi>adding Grace to Grace,</hi> v. 5.

                  </p>
                  <p>§. The <hi>Fourth thing</hi> is, The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate <hi>Reaſon or occaſion,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Apoſtle doth utter himſelf in ſuch a <hi>ſuppoſition [If any of you lack.]</hi>

                  <p>Further, Thirdly, There might be many <hi>ſtrong Chriſtians</hi> (as to the active part of the life of Chriſtianity) who yet might be to ſeek as freſh Souldiers, at the firſt, when ſuch trials come unexpectedly, and thick and threefold upon them; and that they fall into them as <hi>down-fals</hi>
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:109019:77"/>
and Precipices.

                  <p>Now unto ſuch (either of theſe) doth the Apoſtle in this Language <hi>[If any of you lack]</hi> apply himſelf; and therein ſpeaks to their very hearts: But eſpecially to the firſt ſort of weak Chriſtians. And indeed ſpeaks their very fears, and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoughts and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they had or might have of themſelves: And ſo utters their

I ſhall now go forth of my Text, but to fetch in <hi>one thing.</hi> I obſerve when the Apoſtle par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly comes to that part of his Prayer made for the <hi>Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> that they might have <hi>all Patience and Long-ſuffering with Joyfulneſs</hi> (which exactly agrees with what is the matter exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto in this Text) He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores the <hi>GLORIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S POWER OF GOD,</hi> in theſe words, 1 Col. 11. <hi>That ye may be ſtrengthened with all might [ACCORDING TO HIS GLORIO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S POWER] unto all PATIENCE and LONG-S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>F<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FERING with JOYF<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LNESS.</hi> And to draw and fix your hearts on this <hi>Glorious Power</hi> of GOD, and point your <hi>prayers</hi> thereto, is <hi>the thing,</hi> which I mean &amp; intend.</p>
                  <p>And indeed the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this <hi>one thing</hi> will have a general influence into <hi>ALL</hi> thoſe

this in us; then ſurely nothing can be judged ſo prevailing as <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> which are the <hi>Graces in,</hi> and <hi>by which</hi> the Soul going out of it ſelf, in a ſence of its utter inſufficiency, ſupplicates the Grace in Gods heart, to exert this <hi>power,</hi> of his good pleaſure; and ſo do draw it forth, and bring it down into the <hi>Heart.</hi> And then thirdly, This <note place="margin">3 <hi>Head.</hi>
                     </note> gives us the higheſt <hi>encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that we may obtain this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect work of it; however remote from it, the preſent temper of our Spirits may ſeem to be to us: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>that no leſs then ſuch a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous power is requiſite to effect it in the ſtrongeſt Chriſtians; And a power ſo glorious is able to work it in the weakeſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us Pray therefore with all vehemency, for our ſelves, as the Apoſtle did for thoſe <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> that this <hi>glorious power</hi> may come upon us, and <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> our <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>For as this Patience is to be an <hi>[All Patience,]</hi> or elſe it hath not its <hi>perfect work:</hi> ſo this <hi>MIGHT,</hi> it muſt be an <hi>[all might]</hi> you muſt be ſtrengthened with, unto ſuch A <hi>Patience,</hi> of you will not be perfect at it.

For as it muſt be, that, if God will pleaſe to ſtrengthen us, under any <hi>great unuſual</hi> Tentations, that he ſhould put forth no leſs then this <hi>[Glorious power:]</hi> So we

                  <p>It cannot but be a great ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, to a <hi>weak heart,</hi> that finds it ſelf ſo remote and diſtant from ſuch a work of <hi>Patience;</hi> and weak alſo in compariſon of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an <hi>inward might,</hi> that it ſhould have Ground and <hi>Cauſe</hi> to think and to believe, that Gods <hi>glorious power</hi> is engaged moſt <hi>ſreely,</hi> to be <hi>abundantly</hi> and <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily</hi> put forth, if continued to be ſought unto. Why, <hi>this</hi> (ſays the weak heart) <hi>will do it:</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this <hi>glorious power:</hi> And I have found by ſome Tryals already, that <hi>the ſtrong</hi> God and a <hi>weak</hi> heart will be too hard for any thing; yea, for the whole World.</p>

And therefore, when you think your preſent trials, that are come <hi>upon you,</hi> far greater then you can bear, think withall of the <hi>glorious power</hi> of God, that is at hand to help you.

'Tis true, thy preſent trial may be, and is above that in ward ſtrength, which ſerves and hath ſerved hitherto, to act thy graces, in thy ordinary walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with God, holily and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely.
