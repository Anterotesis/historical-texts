            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THE Design of this <hi>Preface</hi> is not
to commend either the Author or
the Matter contained in this little
Book. Let every Reader do as he finds
cause. Nor need any Assurance be given
that Doctor <hi>Owen</hi> was the Author, to any
who have conversed with his Writings, and
will be at the Pains to read this over. It
is indeed his <hi>Application</hi> of the former
Discourses upon this Subject, printed in
the Year 1684. But the Reason why it
was not then added (the Omission whereof
rendred that Book imperfect to judicious
Readers) seems necessary to be given. Had
it pleased God he had lived a little longer,
it would have come out as perfect as his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

transcribed in his Life-time than what was
then printed, and that published soon after
his Death; These Two Chapters wrote only
with his own hand, were found too late to
be then added. They are therefore now
printed to <hi>compleat</hi> those Discourses. And
it is presumed, that as no serious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
who reads this, will be satisfied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the other also: So all who prize the
former, will be glad of the Opportunity to
add this thereunto.</p>

               <p>THE High Priest under the Law when he was
to enter into the Holy Place on the Solemn
day of Atonement, was to take <hi>both his hands
full of sweet Incense</hi> from the <hi>Golden Table of
Incense,</hi> to carry along with him in his entrance. He
had also a <hi>Censer</hi> filled with <hi>Fire,</hi> that was taken from the
Altar of <hi>Burnt-offerings,</hi> where Atonement was made for
Sin with Blood. Upon his actual entrance through the
vail, he put the <hi>Incense on the Fire in the Censer,</hi> until the
<hi>Cloud of it's smoak</hi> covered the <hi>Ark,</hi> and the <hi>Mercy Seat.</hi>
See <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 12, 13. And the end hereof was to
present unto God, in the behalf of the People, a sweet
smelling Savour from the Sacrifice of Propitiation. See
the Declaration of these things in our Exposition of
<hi>Heb. 9th.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN Answer unto this <hi>Mystical Type,</hi> the great <hi>High-priest</hi>
of the Church, our Lord Jesus Christ, being to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the <hi>Holy Place not made with hands,</hi> did by the
glorious Prayer Recorded in this Chapter, influenced
from the <hi>Blood of his Sacrifice,</hi> fill the Heavens above,
the glorious Place of God's Residence, with a <hi>clou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58587:4"/>
Incense,</hi> or the <hi>sweet perfume</hi> of his Blessed Intercession,
typed by the <hi>incense</hi> offered by the High-priest of old.
By the same <hi>Eternal Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e</hi> wherewith he offered himself a
<hi>bloody Sacrifice</hi> to make Atonement for Sin, he kindled
in his most Holy Soul those desires for the <hi>Application</hi>
of all its Benefits unto his <hi>Church,</hi> which are here expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and wherein his Intercession doth consist.</p>
               <p>IT is only one passage in the Verse above named,
that at present I design an enquiry into. And this is the
<hi>subject matter</hi> of what the Lord Christ here desires in the
behalf of those <hi>given him by the Father;</hi> namely, That
they may <hi>behold his glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is evident, That in this Prayer the Lord Christ
hath respect unto his <hi>own Glory,</hi> and the <hi>manifestation</hi> of it,
which he had in the entrance asked of the Father, <hi>ver.</hi> 4,
5. But in this place he hath not so much respect unto it
as <hi>his own,</hi> as unto the Advantage, Benefit, Satisfaction
and Blessedness of his Disciples, in the <hi>beholding</hi> of it.
For these things were the end of all that <hi>Mediatory Glory</hi>
which was given unto him. So <hi>Joseph</hi> charged his <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
when he had revealed himself unto them, that
they should <hi>tell his Father of all his Glory in Egypt, Gen.</hi>
45. 13. This he did, not for an <hi>Ostentation</hi> of his own
Glory, but for the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> which he knew his Father
would take in the Knowledge of it. And such a <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
of his Glory</hi> unto his Disciples doth the Lord
Christ here desire, as might fill them with Blessed Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for evermore.</p>
               <p>THIS alone which is here prayed for, will give them
such satisfaction, and nothing else. The Hearts of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
are like the <hi>Needle</hi> touched by the <hi>Load-stone,</hi> which
cannot rest until it comes to the Point whereunto by the
secret Vertue of it, it is directed. For being once touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Love of Christ, receiving therein an impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of secret ineffable Vertue, they will ever be in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58587:4"/>
and restless, until they come unto him, and <hi>behold
his Glory.</hi> That Soul which can be satisfied <hi>without it,</hi>
that cannot be eternally satisfied <hi>with it,</hi> is not partaker
of the efficacy of his Intercession.</p>
               <p>I shall lay the Foundation of the ensuing Meditations
in this one Assertion, namely, <hi>That one of the greatest Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
and Advancements of Believers, both in this World,
and unto Eternity, consists in their BEHOLDING THE
GLORY OF CHRIST.</hi> This therefore he desires
for them in this Solemn Intercession, as the complement
of all his other requests in their behalf; That they may
<hi>behold my Glory.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; that they may <hi>see, view,
behold</hi> or contemplate on <hi>my Glory.</hi> The Reasons why I
assign not this glorious Priviledge only unto the <hi>Heavenly
state,</hi> which is principally respected in this place, but apply
it unto the state of Believers in this World also, with their
Duties and Priviledges therein, shall be immediately declared.</p>
               <p>ALL Unbelievers do in their Heart call Christ <hi>Ioha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bod;
Where is the Glory?</hi> They see neither <hi>form nor come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
in him,</hi> that he should be desired. They look on
him as <hi>Michael Saul</hi>'s Daughter did on <hi>David dancing before
the Ark,</hi> when she despised him in her Heart. They do
not indeed (many of them) <hi>call Jesus Anathema,</hi> but cry,
<hi>Hail Master,</hi> and then Crucifie him.</p>
               <p>HENCE have we so many Cursed Opinions ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
in derogation unto his Glory, some of them real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
destructive of all that is truly so; yea denying the
<hi>only Lord that bought us,</hi> and substituting a false Christ in
his room. And others there are who express their slight
thoughts of him and his glory, by bold irreverent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,
<hi>of what use his person is in our Religion;</hi> as though
there were any thing in our Religion, that hath either
Reality, Substance, or Truth, but by vertue of its Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
there unto. And by their <hi>Answers,</hi> they bring their own
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> yet nearer unto the borders of Blasphemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58587:5"/>
NEVER was there an Age since the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
was known upon the Earth, wherein there was
such a direct Opposition made unto the <hi>Person and Glory
of Christ,</hi> as there is in that wherein we live. There
were indeed in the first Times of the Church, swarms
of proud, doting, brainsick persons, who vented many
foolish imaginations about him, which issued at length in
<hi>Arianism,</hi> in whose Ruines they were buried. The <hi>Gates of
Hell</hi> in them, prevailed not against the Rock on which
the Church is built. But as it was said of <hi>Caesar, Solus accessie
sobrius, ad perdendam Rempublicam; He alone went soberly
about the Destruction of the Commonwealth;</hi> So we now
have great Numbers who oppose the Person and Glory of
Christ, under a pretence of <hi>Sobriety of Reason,</hi> as they
vainly plead. Yea, the disbelief of the Mysteries of the
<hi>Trinity, and the Incarnation of the Son of God,</hi> the sole Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Christian Religion, is so diffused in the World,
as that it hath almost devoured the power and vitals of
it. And not a few, who dare not yet express their minds,
do give broad intimations of their intentions and good
will towards him, in making them the Object of their
scorn and reproach, who desire to know nothing but him,
and him Crucified.</p>
               <p>GOD in his appointed time will effectually Vindicate
his <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> from the vain attempts of Men of
corrupt minds against them.</p>
               <p>IN the mean time, it is the Duty of all those who
<hi>love the Lord Jesus in sincerity,</hi> to give Testimony in a
peculiar manner unto this Divine Person and Glory, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
unto their several Capacities, because of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
that is made against them.</p>

they are first gradually <hi>conformed</hi> unto it, and then
fixed in the Eternal <hi>enjoyment</hi> of it. For here in this life,
<hi>beholding his Glory, they are changed or transformed into the
likeness of it, 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 18. and hereafter, they shall be <hi>for
ever like unto him,</hi> because they <hi>shall see him as he is, I Joh.</hi>
3. 1, 2. Hereon do our present Comforts, and future
Blessedness depend. This is the Life and Reward of our
Souls. He that <hi>hath seen him hath seen the Father also; Joh.</hi>
14. 9. For we discern the <hi>Light of the Knowledge of God,
only in the Face of Jesus Christ, 2 Cor. 4. 6.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THERE are therefore, two ways or degrees <hi>of behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Glory of Christ,</hi> which are constantly distinguished
in the Scripture. The one is by <hi>Faith</hi> in this World,
which is the Evidence of things not seen. The other is
by <hi>Sight,</hi> or immediate vision in Eternity, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 7. We
walk by faith and not by sight.</hi> We do so whilst we are
in this World, <hi>whilst we are present in the Body, and absent
from the Lord,</hi> ver. 8. But we shall live and walk by <hi>Sight</hi>
hereafter. And it is the Lord Christ and his Glory, which
are immediate objects both of this <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Sight.</hi> For
we here <hi>behold him darkly in a Glass</hi> (that is by Faith) <hi>but
we shall see him face to face;</hi> (by immediate vision) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>we know him in part: but then we shall know him as we are
known, 1 Cor.</hi> 13. 12. What is the difference between
these two ways of <hi>beholding the Glory of Christ;</hi> shall be
afterwards declared.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:58587:6"/>
IT is the first way, namely by <hi>Vision</hi> in the Light of
Glory, that is principally included in that prayer of our
Blessed Saviour, that his Disciples may be <hi>where he is, to
behold his Glory.</hi> But, I shall not confine my enquiry
thereunto; nor doth our Lord Jesus exclude from
his desire, that Sight of his Glory which we have
<hi>by faith</hi> in this World; but prays for the Perfection of
it in Heaven. It is therefore the <hi>first way,</hi> that in the first
place I shall insist upon, and that for the Reasons ensuing.</p>
               <p>1. NO Man shall ever behold the Glory of Christ
by <hi>Sight</hi> hereafter, who doth not in some measure behold
it by <hi>Faith</hi> here in this World. <hi>Grace</hi> is a necessary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> for <hi>Sight.</hi> Where the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
the Soul, is not previously seasoned with <hi>Grace</hi> and
<hi>Faith,</hi> it is not capable of <hi>Glory,</hi> or <hi>Vision.</hi> Nay, persons
not disposed hereby unto it, cannot desire it, whatever
they pretend; they only deceive their own Souls, in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that so they do. Most Men will say with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
living and dying, <hi>that they desire to be with Christ,
and to behold his Glory;</hi> But they can give no Reason,
why they should desire any such thing; only they think
it somewhat that is better than to be in that evil conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which otherwise they must be cast into for ever, when
they can be here no more. If a Man pretend himself to
be enamoured on, or greatly to desire what he never <hi>saw,</hi>
nor was ever represented unto him, he doth but dote on
his own Imaginations. And the pretended desires of
many, to <hi>behold the Glory of Christ</hi> in Heaven, who have
no view of it by Faith whilst they are here in this
World, are nothing but self-deceiving imaginations.</p>
               <p>SO do the <hi>Papists</hi> delude themselves. Their Carnal
Affections are excited by their outward Senses, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in <hi>Images</hi> of Christ, in his Sufferings, his Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Glory above. Hereon they satisfie themselves,
that they <hi>behold the Glory of Christ</hi> himself, and that with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58587:6"/>
Love and great Delight. But whereas there is not the
least true Representation made of the Lord Christ, or his
Glory, in these things, that being confined absolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Gospel alone, and this way of attempting it being
laid under a severe interdict, they do but sport themselves
with their own deceivings.</p>
               <p>THE Apostle tells us concerning himself, and other
Believers, when the Lord Christ was present, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
with them in the Days of his Flesh, that they <hi>saw
his Glory, the Glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full
of Grace and Truth. Joh. 1. 14.</hi> And we may enquire,
what was this Glory of Christ, which they so saw, and
by what means they obtained a prospect of it? For (1.)
It was not the Glory of his <hi>outward condition,</hi> as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Glory and Grandeur of the Kings and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
of the Earth; For he made <hi>himself of no Reputation,</hi>
but being in the Form of a Servant, he walked in the
Condition of a Man of low Degree. The Secular Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of his <hi>pretendedVicar,</hi> makes no Representation of
that Glory of his, which his Disciples saw. He kept no
Court, nor House of Entertainment, nor (though he
made all things) had of his own where to lay his Head.
Nor 2. Was it with respect to the outward Form of
the <hi>Flesh which he was made,</hi> wherein he took our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
on him, as we see the Glory of a comely or beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Person; For he had therein neither <hi>form nor comelines<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi>
that he should be desired, <hi>his visage was so marred more
than any Man, and his form more than the sons of men,</hi> Isa.
52. 14. <hi>Chap. 53. 2, 3.</hi> All things appeared in him as
became <hi>a Man of Sorrows.</hi> Nor 3. Was it absolutely the
<hi>Eternal Essential Glory of his Divine Nature,</hi> that is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For this no Man can see in this World. What we
shall attain in a view thereof hereafter, we know not.
But 4. It was his Glory, as he was <hi>full of Grace and
Truth.</hi> They saw the Glory of his Person and his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58587:7"/>
Office in the Administration of <hi>Grace and Truth</hi>
And how, or by what means did they see this Glory of
Christ? It was by <hi>Faith,</hi> and no otherwise. For this
Priviledge was granted unto them only who <hi>received him,
and believed on his name,</hi> ver. 12. This was that Glory
which the <hi>Baptist</hi> saw, when upon his coming unto him
he said unto all that were present, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God
which taketh away the Sin of the World, Joh.</hi> 1. 29, 30,
31, 32, 33.</p>
               <p>WHEREFORE let no Man deceive himself: He that
hath no <hi>Sight</hi> of the Glory of Christ here, shall never
have any of it hereafter unto his Advantage. It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unto Edification, to discourse of Beholding the Glory
of Christ in Heaven by <hi>vision,</hi> until we go through a tryal,
whether we see any thing of it in this World by <hi>Faith</hi> or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> THE <hi>behol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing of Christ in Glory,</hi> is that which
in it self is too High, Illustrious, and Marvellous for us
in our present condition. It hath a splendor and glory
too great for our present Spiritual <hi>visible faculty;</hi> as the
direct, immediate sight of the Sun darkens our sight,
and doth not relieve or strengthen it at all. Wherefore we
have no way to take into our minds any true Spiritual
Apprehensions of the Nature of <hi>Immediate Vision,</hi> or what
it is to see the Glory of Christ in Heaven, but by that
<hi>View</hi> which we have by <hi>Faith</hi> in this life of the same
Glory. Whatever otherwise falls into our Minds, is but
conjecture and imagination; Such as are the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of most about Heavenly things.</p>
               <p>I have seen and read somewhat of the Writings of
of Learned Men, concerning the <hi>state of future glory;</hi>
some of them are filled with <hi>excellent Nations of Truth,</hi> and
<hi>Elegancy of Speech,</hi> whereby they cannot but much affect
the minds of them who duely consider what they say. But
I know not well whence it comes to pass, many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
that in reading of such discourses they are like a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58587:7"/>
Man who <hi>behold his natural face in a Glass, and immediately
forgets what manner of Man he was;</hi> as one of old complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the same purpose upon his perusal of <hi>Plato</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations
about the Immortality of the Soul. The
things spoken do not abide, nor Incorporate with our
minds. They <hi>please</hi> and <hi>refresh</hi> for a little while, like a
showre of Rain in a dry Season, that soaketh not unto
the Roots of things; the power of them doth not enter
into us. Is it not all from hence, that their <hi>notions of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
things</hi> are not enduced out of the <hi>Experience</hi> which
we have of the Beginnings of them in this World; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, they can make no permanent aboad in our
minds, nor continue any Influence upon our Affections?
yea, the Soul is disturbed, not edified, in all <hi>Contemplations
of future Glory,</hi> when things are proposed unto it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in this life it hath neither foretaste, sense, experience,
nor evidence. No man ought to look for any thing in
Heaven, but what one way or other he hath some <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi>
of in this Life. If Men were fully perswaded
hereof, they would be, it may be, more in the exercise
of Faith and Love about Heavenly things, than for the
most part they are. At present they know not what they
enjoy, and they look for they know not what.</p>
               <p>HENCE is it, that Men utterly strangers unto all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of the Beginning of Glory in themselves as an
effect of Faith, have filled their Divine Worship with
<hi>Images, Pictures,</hi> and <hi>Musick,</hi> to represent unto themselves
somewhat of that Glory which they fancy to be above.
For into that which is truly so, they have no prospect,
nor can have; because they have no experience of its
power in themselves; nor do they taste of its Goodness
by any of its First-fruits in their own minds. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by that view alone, and not otherwise, which we
have of the <hi>Glory of Christ by Faith</hi> here in this World, we
may attain such blessed conceptions of our beholding <hi>his

glory above</hi> by <hi>immediate vision,</hi> as shall draw out our
Hearts unto the Admiration of it, and desires of its
full enjoyment.</p>
               <p>3. HEREIN then our present <hi>edification</hi> is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
concerned. For in this present <hi>beholding of the Glory
of Christ,</hi> the Life and Power of Faith are most eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acted. And from this Exercise of <hi>Faith,</hi> doth <hi>Love</hi>
unto Christ principally, if not solely arise and spring.
If therefore we desire to have <hi>Faith in its vigor,</hi> or <hi>Love
in its Power,</hi> giving Rest, Complacency, and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto our own Souls, we are to seek for them in the
diligent discharge of this Duty; elsewhere they will not
be found. Herein would I live; Herein would I Dye;
Hereon would I dwell in my Thoughts and Affections,
to the withering and consumption of all the painted
Beauties of this World, unto the Crucifying all things
here below, until they become unto me a dead and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
thing, no way meet for affectionate Embraces.</p>
               <p>FOR these, and the like Reasons, I shall first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into our Beholding of the <hi>Glory of Christ in this
world by Faish;</hi> And therein endeavour to lead the Souls
of them that Believe, into the more retired walks of Faith,
Love, and Holy Meditation, <hi>whereby the King is held in his
Galleries.</hi> Caut. 7. 5.</p>
               <p>BUT because there is no Benefit in, nor advantage by
the Contemplation of this Sacred Truth, but what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in an improvement of the practice of the duty declared
in it, namely, the <hi>constant beholding of the Glory of Christ by
Faith:</hi> I shall for the promotion of it, premise some few
Advantages which we may have thereby.</p>
               <p>1. WE shall hereby be made <hi>fit and meet for Heaven.</hi>
Every man is not so, who desires it, and hopes for it.
For some are not only unworthy of it, and excluded from
it by reason of Sin; but they are <hi>unmeet</hi> for it, and inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of any advantage by it. All men indeed think
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58587:9"/>
themselves <hi>fit enough for Glory</hi> (what should hinder them?)
if they could attain it. But it is because they know not
what it is. Men shall not be <hi>clothed with Glory,</hi> as it
were, whether they will or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is to be received in
that Exercise of the Faculties of their Souls, which such
Persons have no Ability for. Musick hath no Pleasure
in it, unto them that cannot hear; nor the most beautiful
Colours unto them that cannot see. It would be no Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
unto a Fish to take him from the bottom of the Ocean,
filled with Cold and Darkness, and to place him under the
Beams of the Sun. For he is no way meet to receive
any Refreshment thereby. Heaven it self would not be
more advantagious unto Persons not renewed by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Grace in this Life.</p>
               <p>HENCE the Apostle gives thanks <hi>unto the Father, who
hath made us meet to be Partakers of the Inheritance of the
Saints in Light, Col.</hi> 1. 12. Indeed the Beginning here,
and the Fulness of Glory hereafter, are communicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Believers by an Almighty Act of the Will and Grace
of God. But yet he hath ordained Ways and Means
whereby they may be made <hi>meet receptive Subjects</hi> of the
Glory so to be communicated unto them. That this Way
and Means is by the <hi>beholding of the Glory of Christ by Faith,</hi>
shall be fully declared in our Progress. This therefore
should excite us unto this Duty; for all our <hi>present</hi> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
consists in our Preparation for <hi>future</hi> Glory.</p>
               <p>2. NO Man can by Faith take a real View of this
Glory, but <hi>Vertue will proceed from it</hi> in a transforming
Power, to <hi>change him into the same Image. 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 18.
How this is done, and how we become like unto Christ,
by beholding his Glory, shall be fully declared in our
Progress.</p>
               <p>3. THE constant Contemplation of the Glory of
Christ, will give Rest, Satisfaction, and Complacency
unto the Souls of them who are exercised therein. Our
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58587:10"/>
Minds are apt to be filled with a Multitude of perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Thoughts, Fears, Cares, Dangers, Distresses, Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Lusts, do make various Impressions on the
Minds of Men, filling them with Disorder, Darkness,
and Confusion. But where the Soul is fixed in its
Thoughts and Contemplations on this glorious Object, it
will be brought into, and kept in an Holy, Serene, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Frame. For to be <hi>Spiritually minded, is Life and
Peace.</hi> And this it doth, by taking off our Hearts, from
all undue Regard unto all things below, in comparison of
the great Worth, Beauty, and Glory of what we are
conversant withal. See <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
herein makes many of us Strangers unto an Heavenly
Life; and to live beneath the Spiritual Refreshments and
Satisfactions that the Gospel doth tender unto us.</p>
               <p>4. THE Sight of the Glory of Christ, is the Spring
and Cause of our Everlasting Blessedness. We <hi>shall be
ever with the Lord, 1 Thes.</hi> 4. 17. Or, <hi>be with Christ,
which is best of all. Phil.</hi> 1. 23. For there shall we <hi>behold
his Glory, Joh.</hi> 17. 24. and by <hi>seeing him as he is, we shall
be made like him, 1 Joh.</hi> 3. 2. which is our Everlasting
Blessedness.</p>
               <p>THE Enjoyment of God by <hi>Sight,</hi> is commonly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Beatifical Vision;</hi> and it is the sole Fountain of all
the Actings of our Souls in the State of Blessedness, which
the old <hi>Philosophers</hi> knew nothing of; neither do we
know distinctly what they are, or what is this Sight of
God. Howbeit, this we know, that God in his <hi>Immense
Essence</hi> is <hi>invisible</hi> unto our Corporeal Eyes, and will be
so to Eternity; as also <hi>incomprehensible</hi> unto our Minds.
For nothing can perfectly comprehend that which is Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
but what is it self Infinite. Wherefore the Blessed
and <hi>Blessing Sight</hi> which we shall have of God, will be
always <hi>in the Face of Jesus Christ.</hi> Therein will that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
of the Glory of God in his Infinite Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58587:10"/>
and all their blessed Operations, so shine into our
Souls, as shall immediately fill us with Peace, Rest, and
Glory.</p>
               <p>THESE things we here admire, but cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.
We know not well what we say, when we speak
of them: yet is there in True Belivers a Fore-sight, and
Fore-taste of this Glorious Condition. There enters some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by the Word and Spirit into their hearts such a
sense of the <hi>uncreated Glory</hi> of God, shining forth in Christ,
as Affects and Satiates their Souls with ineffable Joy.
Hence ariseth that <hi>Peace of God</hi> which is <hi>above all vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi>
keeping our Hearts and Minds through Jesus
Christ. <hi>Phil. 4. 7. Christ in Believers the Hope of Glory,</hi>
gives them to taste of the First-fruits of it; yea, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to bath their Souls in the <hi>Fountain of Life,</hi> and to
<hi>drink of the Rivers of Pleasure</hi> that are at his Right hand.
Where any are utterly unacquainted with these things, they
are Carnal, yea, Blind, <hi>and seeing nothing afar off.</hi> These
Enjoyments indeed are rare, and for the most part of
short Continuance. <hi>Rara hora, brevis mora.</hi> But it is
from our own Sloth and Darkness that we do not enjoy
more <hi>Visits</hi> of this Grace; and that the Dawnings of
Glory do not more shine on our Souls. Such things as
these may excite us to Diligence in the Duty proposed
unto us.</p>
               <p>AND I shall enquire. 1. <hi>What</hi> is that <hi>Glory of Christ,</hi>
which we do, or may <hi>behold</hi> by Faith? 2. <hi>How</hi> do we
<hi>behold</hi> it? 3. <hi>Wherein</hi> our doing so differs from immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Vision in Heaven. And in the whole we shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
an Answer unto the Enquiry made unto the Spouse,
by the Daughters of <hi>Jerusalem. Cant. 5. 9. What is thy
Beloved more than another Beloved, thou fairest among Women?
What is thy Beloved more than another Beloved, that thou dost
so charge us?</hi>

Readers for their full Declaration and Vindication. Herein
is he glorious, in that he is the great <hi>Representative</hi> of the
Nature of God, and his Will unto us, which without
him would have been eternally hid from us, or been invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
unto us; we should never have <hi>seen</hi> God at any
time, here nor hereafter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
               <p>IN his Divine Person absolutely considered, he is the
Essential Image of God, even the Father: <hi>He is in the
Father,</hi> and the Father in him, in the Unity of the same
Divine Essence, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 10. Now he is <hi>with the Father,
John</hi> 1. 1. In the Distinction of his Person, so is he
his Essential Image, <hi>Col. 1. 15. Heb.</hi> 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. In his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
he becomes the Representative Image of God
unto the Church, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. without whom our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings
can make no such Approach unto the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Excellencies, but that God continues to be <hi>unto us,</hi>
what he is in <hi>himself, the Invisible God.</hi> In the Face of
Jesus Christ, we see his Glory.</p>
               <p>THIS is the <hi>Original Glory of Christ given him by his
Father,</hi> and which by Faith we may behold: He, and
he alone declares, represents and makes known unto An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and Men, the <hi>Essential Glory</hi> of the Invisible God,
his Attributes and his Will, without which, a perpetual
comparative Darkness would have been on the whole
Creation, especially that part of it here below.</p>
               <p>THIS is the Foundation of our Religion, the <hi>Rock
whereon the Church is built,</hi> the Ground of all our Hopes of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58587:12"/>
Salvation, of Life and Immortality: All is resolved into
this; namely, the <hi>Representation</hi> that is made of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Will of God, in the Person and Office of Christ:
If this fail us, we are lost for ever; if this Rock stand firm,
the Church is safe here, and shall be triumphant here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>HEREIN then is the Lord Christ exceedingly glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Those who cannot <hi>beheld this Glory. of his by Faith,</hi>
namely, as he is the great Divine Ordinance to <hi>represent
God</hi> unto us, they know him not. In their Worship of
him, they worship but an Image of their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising.</p>
               <p>YEA, in the Ignorance and Neglect hereof consists
the <hi>formal Nature of Vnbelief,</hi> even that which is inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ruinous unto the Souls of Men. He that discerns not
the <hi>Representation of the Glory of God</hi> in the Person of Christ
unto the Souls of Men, is an Unbeliever. Such was the
State of the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> of old; They
did not, they would not, they could not behold the Glory
of God in him, nor how he did represent him. That this
was both the Cause, and the <hi>Formal Nature</hi> of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
the Apostle declares at large, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21, 22, 23,
24, 25. Not to see the Wisdom of God, and the Power
of God, and consequently all the other holy Properties of
his Nature in Christ, is to be an Unbeliever.</p>
               <p>THE Essence of Faith consists in a due Ascription of
Glory to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20. This we cannot attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
without the Manifestation of those <hi>Divine Excellencies</hi>
unto us, wherein he is Glorious. This is done in Christ
alone, so as that we may glorifie God in a saving and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
Manner. He who discerns not the Glory of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Wisdom, Power, Goodness, Love and Grace, in the
Person and Office of Christ, with the way of the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Sinners by him, is an Unbeliever.</p>

HENCE the great Design of the Devil in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Preaching of the Gospel, was to <hi>blind the
Eyes of Men,</hi> and fill their Minds with Prejudices, that
they <hi>might not behold</hi> this Glory of his; So the Apostle
gives an Account of his Success in this Design, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 3,
4. If our Gospel be hid, it is hid unto them that are lost, in
whom the God of this World hath blinded the Minds of them
that believe not, lest the Light of the glorious Gospel of Christ,
who is the Image of God, should shine unto them.</hi> By vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Ways and Methods of Deceit, to secure the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he had got, of being <hi>God of this World,</hi> by Pretences
and Appearances of supernatural Power and Wisdom, he
laboured to blind the Eyes of Men with Prejudices against
that <hi>glorious Light of the Gospel,</hi> which proposed the Lord
Christ as the only <hi>Image of God.</hi> This Blindness, this
Darkness is cured in them that believe, by the mighty
Power of God; For <hi>God who commanded the Light to shine
out of Darkness, hath irradiated our Hearts with the Knowledge
of the Glory of God in the Face of Jesus Christ, v.</hi> 6. wherein
true, saving Faith doth consist. Under this <hi>Darkness</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
the unbelieving World of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and
such is the present Condition of all by whom the Divine
Person of Christ is denied; for no mere Creature can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
make a perfect Representation of God unto us. But
we must a little further enquire into this Mystery.</p>
               <p>SINCE Men fell from God by sin, it is no small
part of their Misery and Punishment, that they are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with <hi>thick Darkness and Ignorance</hi> of the Nature of
God. They know him not, they have not seen him at
any time: Hence is that Promise to the Church in Christ,
<hi>Isa. 60. 1, 2. For behold the Darkness shall cover the Earth,
and gross Darkness the People: but the Lord shall arise upon
thee, and his Glory shall be seen upon thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Antient Philosophers made great Enquiries into,
and obtained many Notions of the Divine <hi>Being,</hi> its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58587:13"/>
and Excellencies. And these Notions they adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with great Elegancy of Speech, to allure others unto
the Admiration of them. Hereon they boasted themselves
to be the only <hi>Wise Men</hi> in the World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 22. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
they <hi>boasted</hi> that they were the Wise:
But we must abide in the Judgment of the Apostles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them in their Enquiries: He assures us, that the
<hi>World in its Wisdom,</hi> that is, these wise Men in it by their
Wisdom <hi>knew not God, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 21. And he calls the
Authors of their best Notions <hi>Atheists,</hi> or <hi>Men without God
in the Word,</hi> Ephes. 2. 12. For,</p>
               <p>1. THEY had no certain Guide, Rule, nor Light,
which being attended unto, might lead them infallibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Knowledge of the Divine Nature: All they had of
this Kind, was their own <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> their <hi>Reasonings</hi> or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
whereby they commenced <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>the great Disputers of the World;</hi> but in them they
<hi>maxed vain, and their foolish Heart was darkned, Rom.</hi> 1. 21.
They did at best but endeavour <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to feel after
God,</hi> as Men do in the Dark, after what they cannot clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discern, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 27. Among others, <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Book
<hi>De Natura Deorum,</hi> gives us an exact Account of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the Apostle in that Expression. And it is at
this Day not Want of Wit, but Hatred of the Mysteries
of our Religion, which makes so many prone to forgo all
<hi>Supernatural Revelation,</hi> and to betake themselves unto a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
declared, as they suppose, by Reason, and the
Light of Nature; like Bats and Owls, who being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to bear the Light of the Sun, betake themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Twi-light, to the Dawnings of Light and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>2. WHATEVER they did attain, as unto <hi>rational
Notions</hi> about things invisible and incomprehensible, yet
could they never deliver themselves from such Principles
and Practises in Idolatry and all manner of flagitious Sins,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58587:13"/>
as that they could be of any Benefit unto them. This is
so effectually demonstrated by the Apostle in the <hi>First
Chapter of the Epistle to the Romans,</hi> as that we need not to
insist upon it.</p>
               <p>MEN may talk what they please of a <hi>Light within them,</hi>
or of the Power of Reason, to conduct them unto that
Knowledge of God, whereby they may live unto him:
But if they had nothing else, if they did not boast <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi>
of that Light, which hath its Foundation and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
in Divine Revelation alone, they would not excel
them, who in the best Management of their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings,
<hi>knew not God,</hi> but waxed vain in their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>WITH respect unto this <hi>Vniversal Darkness,</hi> that is,
Ignorance of God, with horrid Confusion accompanying
it in the Minds of Men, Christ is called, and is, the <hi>Light
of Men,</hi> the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> because in and by him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
this Darkness is dispelled, as he is the <hi>Son of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. THIS Darkness in the Minds of Men, this Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of God, his Nature and his Will, was the <hi>Original
of all Evil</hi> unto the World, and yet continues so to be.
For,</p>
               <p>1. HEREON did Satan erect his Kingdom and
Throne, obtaining in his Design until he bare himself as
<hi>the God of this World,</hi> and was so esteemed by the most.
He exalted himself by Vertue of this <hi>Darkness</hi> (as he is <hi>the
Prince of Darkness,</hi>) into the Place and Room of God, as
the Object of the Religious Worship of Men. For the
things which the <hi>Gentiles sacrificed, they sacrificed unto De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
and not to God, 1 Cor. 10. 21. Levit. 17. 7. Chap. 32.
17. Psal. 108. 27. Gal. 3. 8.</hi> This is the Territory of
Satan; yea, the Power and Scepter of his Kingdom in
the Minds of the <hi>Children of Disobedience.</hi> Hereby
he maintains his Dominion unto this Day in many and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58587:14"/>
great Nations, and with individual persons innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>2. THIS is the spring of all wickedness and confusion
among men themselves. Hence arose that flood of Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
in the <hi>Old World,</hi> which God took away with
a <hi>Flood of Desolation:</hi> Hence were the sins of <hi>Sodom and
Gomorrah,</hi> which he revenged with <hi>fire from Heaven.</hi> In
brief: All the Rage, Blood, Confusion, Desolations,
Cruelties, Oppressions, Villanies, which the World hath
been, and is filled withal, whereby the souls of men have
been, and are <hi>flouded</hi> into eternal destruction, have all
arisen from this corrupt Fountain of the Ignorance of
God.</p>
               <p>3. OF such as those described, we are the <hi>Posterity</hi>
and Off-spring. Our Fore-fathers in this Nation, were
given up unto as brutish a <hi>service of the Devil,</hi> as any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
under the Sun. It is therefore an effect of infinite
mercy, that the day hath dawned on us, poor <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
and that the <hi>day-spring from on high hath visited us.</hi> See
the glory of this Grace expressed, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10. God might have left us to perish in the blindness
and ignorance of our Fore-fathers; but of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
and by his own powerful Grace alone, he hath
<hi>translated us out of darkness into his marvellous light.</hi> But
alas! the horrible ingratitude of men, for the glorious
light of the Gospel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the abuse of it, will issue in a
fore revenge.</p>
               <p>GOD was known under the Old Testament, by <hi>the
Revelation of his Word,</hi> and the Institution of his Worship.
This was the glory and priviledge of <hi>Israel,</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi>
declares, <hi>Psal. 147. 19, 20. He sheweth his word unto
Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel; He hath not
deal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> so with any Nation,</hi> The Church then <hi>knew him;</hi> yet
so as that they had an apprehension that he dwelt in
<hi>thick darkness,</hi> where they could not have any clear views
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58587:14"/>
of him, <hi>Exod. 20. 21. Deut. 5. 22. 1 Kings 8. 12. 2
Chron.</hi> 6. 1. And the Reason why God so represented
himself in <hi>darkness</hi> unto them, was to instruct them in
their imperfect state, wherein they could not comprehend
that glory which should afterwards be revealed. For as
he is now made known in Christ, we see that <hi>he is light,
and in him there is no darkness at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. HITHERTO<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> darkness in general covered the
Earth, and gross darkness the people, as unto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God; only there was a twilight in the Church.
The day did not yet dawn, the <hi>shadows did not flee away,</hi>
nor the <hi>day-star shine</hi> in the hearts of men. But when
the <hi>Son of Righteousness</hi> did arise in his strength and beauty,
when the Son of God <hi>appeared in the flesh,</hi> and in the
discharge of his Office; God himself, as unto his Being,
and manner of Existence in <hi>three distinct persons,</hi> with all
the glorious properties of the Divine Nature, were illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
manifested unto them that did believe, and the light
of the knowledge of them dispelled all the <hi>shadows</hi> that
were in the Church, and shone into the <hi>darkness</hi> which
was in the world, so as that none continued ignorant of
God, but those who would not see; See <hi>Job</hi> 1. 5, 14,
17, 18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>HEREIN is the Lord Christ glorious.</hi> And this is that
which I shall now speak unto; namely, <hi>How we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the glory of Christ</hi> in the Representation and Revelation
that is made of God and his glory, in his Person and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
unto all that do believe. For it is not so much the
declaration of the nature of the things themselves, wherein
the glory of Christ doth consist, as our <hi>way</hi> and <hi>duty,</hi> in
the <hi>beholding of them,</hi> which at present is designed.</p>
               <p>HE calls unto us, saying, <hi>Behold me, look unto me, and
be saved,</hi> Isa. 45. 2. What is it that we see in Christ?
What do we behold in him? He asketh that
Question concerning his Church, <hi>What will ye see in the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58587:15"/>
Shulamite?</hi> Whereto he answers, <hi>as it were the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of two armies,</hi> Cant. 6. 13. or the Two Churches
of the Old and New Testament, in order and beauty.
We may enquire, What shall we, what do we see in him?
Do we see him as the <hi>Image of the invisible God,</hi> representing
him, his Nature, Properties, and Will unto us? Do we see
him as the <hi>Character,</hi> the <hi>express Image of the Person of the
Father,</hi> so as that we have no need of <hi>Philip</hi>'s Request,
<hi>Lord, shew us the Father,</hi> because having seen him, <hi>we have
seen the Father also,</hi> John 14. 9.</p>
               <p>THIS is our first saving view of Christ, the first instance
of our <hi>beholding his glory by faith.</hi> So to see him, as to see
God in him, is to behold his glory; for herein is he eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
glorious. And this is that Glory whose view we
ought to long for, and labour after. And if we see it not,
we are yet in darkness; yea, tho' we say we see, we are
blind like others. So <hi>David</hi> longed and prayed for it,
when yet he could behold it only in Types and Shadows,
<hi>Psal. 63. 1, 2. O God, thou art my God, early will I seek
thee; my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee, to see
thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen them in the sanctuary.</hi>
For there was in the Sancturay an obscure representation
of the Glory of God in Christ. How much more should
we prize that view of it, which we may have with open
face, tho' yet <hi>as in a glass?</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>MOSES</hi> when he had seen the Works of God, which
were great and marvellous, yet found not himself satisfied
therewith: Wherefore after all, he prays that God <hi>would
shew him his Glory, Exod.</hi> 33. 18. He knew that the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
Rest, Blessedness and Satisfaction of the Soul, is
not in seeing the <hi>works</hi> of God, but the <hi>Glory of God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Therefore did he desire some immediate dawnings
of it upon him in this World. <hi>I beseech thee shew me thy
Glory.</hi> And if we have right apprehensions of the Future
State of Blessedness, we cannot but have the same desire
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58587:15"/>
of seeing <hi>more of his Glory</hi> in this life. But the Question
is, How me may attain it? If we are left unto our selves
in this Enquiry, if we have no other way for it, but the
immediate fixing of our thoughts on the Immensity of
the Divine Nature, we must come every one to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
that <hi>Agur</hi> makes on the like consideration; <hi>Surely
I am more brutish than any Man, and have not the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of a Man; I neither learned Wisdom, nor have the
Knowledge of the Holy. Who hath ascended up into Heaven,
or descended? Who hath gathered the wind in his fist? Who
hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath established all
the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his
sons name, if thou canst tell, Prov.</hi> 30, 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>IT is in Christ alone, that we may
have a clear distinct view of the Glory
of God and his Excellencies:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Joh. 1. 18. Chap. 14. 7, 8, 9, 10. 2 Cor. 4. 6. Col. 1. 16. Ephes. 3. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Heb. 1. 2.</note> For him,
and him <hi>alone</hi> hath he appointed the
representative of himself unto us: And
we shall take an Account hereof in
one or two especial Instances.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>INFINITE Wisdom</hi> is one of the most glorious
Properties of the Divine Nature: It is that which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective
of all the external Works of God, wherein the
Glory of all the other Excellencies of God is manifested;
wherefore the manifestation of the whole Glory of God
proceeds originally from <hi>Infinite Wisdom.</hi> But as <hi>Job</hi> speaks,
<hi>Where shall this Wisdom be found, and what is the place of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding?
Chap. 28. 12. Can we by searching, find out
God? Can we find out the Almighty to perfection? Chap.</hi> 11. 7.
As it is in it self an Essential, Eternal Property of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature, we can have no comprehension of it: We
can but adore it in that infinite distance wherein we stand
from God; but in its Operations and Effects it may be
discerned; for they are designed of God for its manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station.
Among these the most excellent is the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58587:16"/>
of the great Work of the Salvation of the Church;
so it is celebrated by the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 9, 10, 11.
<hi>To make all Men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which
from the beginning of the World, hath been hid in God, who
created all things by Jesus Christ, to the intent, that now unto
the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known
by the Church, the manifold Wisdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we have any Interest in God, if we have any hopes
of Blessedness in <hi>beholding of his Glory</hi> unto Eternity, we
cannot but desire a view (such as is attainable) of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<hi>manifold Wisdom</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in this life. But it is in
Christ alone that we can discern any thing of it; for him
hath the Father chosen and sealed to represent it unto us.
<hi>All the Treasures of this Wisdom are hid,</hi> laid up, and laid
out <hi>in him:</hi> Herein lies the essence and form of Faith.
Believers by it do see the Wisdom of God in Christ, in
his Person and Office: <hi>Christ the Wisdom of God;</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers
see it not, as the Apostle argues, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22,
23, 24.</p>
               <p>IN beholding the Glory of this Infinite Wisdom of
God in Christ, we <hi>behold his own Glory</hi> also; the Glory
given him of his Father; for this is his Glory, that in
and by him, and him alone the Wisdom of God is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
and represented unto us. When God appointed
him as the great and only means of this end, <hi>he gave him
honour and glory</hi> above the whole Creation: for it is but
little of Divine Wisdom which the works of it declare, in
comparison of what is manifested in Christ Jesus. We
no way deny or extenuate the manifestation that is made
of the <hi>Wisdom of God</hi> in the works of Creation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
It is sufficient to detect the folly of <hi>Atheism</hi> and
and Idolatry, and was designed of God unto that end.
But it's <hi>comparative insufficiency,</hi> with respect unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representation
of it in Christ, as unto the ends of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God aright, and living unto him, the Scripture doth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58587:16"/>
abundantly attest. And the abuse of it was <hi>Catholic,</hi> as
the Apostle declares, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. &amp;c. To see this Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
clearly, is our Wisdom; and a due apprehension of
it, fills the Souls of Believers with <hi>joy unspeakable, and full
of Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. WE may also instance in the <hi>Love of God.</hi> The
Apostle tells us, that <hi>God is Love, 1 Joh.</hi> 4. 8. Divine Love
is not to be considered only in its effects, but in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Essence; and so it is <hi>God himself; For God is Love.</hi>
And a blessed Revelation this is of the Divine Nature: It
casts out Envy, Hatred, Malice, Revenge, with all their
Fruits, in Rage, Fierceness, Implacability, Persecution,
Murther, into the Territories of Satan. They belong
not unto God in his Nature or Actings; for <hi>God is Love.</hi>
So the same Apostle tells us, that he who <hi>slew his Brother,
was of the wicked one,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 12. He was of the Devil
his Father, and his works did he do.</p>
               <p>BUT the Enquiry is as before; How shall we have
a view of this <hi>Love,</hi> of God as Love? By what way or
means shall we behold the Glory of it? It is hidden from
all living, in God himself. The Wise <hi>Philosophers,</hi> who
discoursed so much of the <hi>Love of God,</hi> knew nothing of
this, that <hi>God is Love.</hi> The <hi>Most</hi> of the Natural Notions
of men about it are <hi>corrupt,</hi> and the <hi>best</hi> of them <hi>weak</hi> and
imperfect. Generally the Thoughts of men about it, are,
that he is of a facile and easie Nature, one that they may
make bold withal in all their occasions, as the <hi>Psalmist</hi>
declares, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 21. And whereas it must be learned
in its Effects, Operations and Divine Ways of its mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation,
those who know not Christ, know nothing
of them; and many things in Providence do interpose to
hinder our view of this Love; for although that indeed
<hi>God is Love,</hi> yet <hi>his wrath is revealed from Heaven against the
ungodliness of Men:</hi> As all things at this day are filled with
Evidences of his anger and displeasure: How then shall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58587:17"/>
we know, wherein shall we behold the Glory of God in
this, that he is <hi>Love?</hi> The Apostle declares it in the next
words, <hi>ver. 9. Herein was manifest the love of God towards
us, because God sent his only begotten Son into the World, that
we might live through him.</hi> This is the only Evidence given
us that <hi>God is Love.</hi> Hereby alone is the Divine Nature
as <hi>such</hi> made known unto us; namely in the Mission, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and Office of the Son of God; Without this all is in
Darkness as unto the true Nature and supream Operation
of this Divine Love.</p>
               <p>HEREIN do we behold the Glory of Christ himself,
even in this life. This Glory was given him of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Namely, That he now should declare and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that <hi>God is Love;</hi> and he did so, <hi>that in all things
he might have the Preheminence.</hi> Herein we may see how
Excellent, how Beautiful, how Glorious and Desirable he
is, seeing in him alone we have a due Representation of
God <hi>as he is Love,</hi> which is the most joyful Sight of God
that any Creature can obtain. He who beholds not the
Glory of Christ herein, is utterly ignorant of those Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Mysteries; he knoweth neither God nor Christ;
he hath neither the Father nor the Son. He knows not
God, because he knows not the holy Properties of his
Nature in the Principal way designed by infinite Wisdom
for their Manifestation; he knows not Christ, because he
sees not the Glory of God in him. Wherefore whatever
Notions Men may have from the Light of Nature, or
from the Works of Providence, that there is <hi>Love in God,</hi>
however they may adorn them in elegant affecting Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions:
Yet from them no Man can know that <hi>God is
Love,</hi> In the Revelation hereof Christ hath the Preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence;
nor ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> any Man comprehend any thing of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
but in him. It is that which the whole Light of the
Creation cannot discover; for it is the Spring and Center
of the Mystery of Godliness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:58587:17"/>
THESE things are of the <hi>deep things of God,</hi> such as
belong unto that <hi>Wisdom of God in a Mystery,</hi> which they
that are Carnal cannot receive, as the Apostle testifies,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. But the meanest Believer who lives in the
Exercise of Faith, may have an Understanding of them
so far as is needful unto his Love and Obedience. The
Sum of the whole is this; if you would behold the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Christ, as the great Means of your Sanctification
and Consolation, as the only Preparation for the behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Glory in Eternal Blessedness: Consider what of
God is made known and <hi>represented</hi> unto you in him,
wherein God purposed and designed to glorifie himself in
him: Now this is all that may be known of God in a
saving manner; especially his <hi>Wisdom,</hi> his <hi>Love,</hi> his
Goodness, Grace and Mercy, whereon the Life of our
Souls doth depend; And the Lord Christ being appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the only Way and Means hereof, how exceeding glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
must he be in the Eyes of them that do believe!</p>
               <p>THESE things being promised, I shall close this first
Consideration of that <hi>Glory of Christ which we behold by
Faith in this World,</hi> with some such Observations, as may
excite us unto the Practise of this great Duty, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of this great Priviledge; the greatest which
on this side Heaven we can be made Partakers of.</p>
               <p>THERE are some who regard not these things at all,
but rather despise them. They never entertain any seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
thoughts of obtaining a View of the Glory of God
in Christ, which is to be Unbelievers. They look on him
as a <hi>Teacher</hi> that came forth from God to reveal his Will,
and to teach us his Worship: and so indeed he was. But
this they say was the <hi>sole use of his Person in Religion,</hi> which
is <hi>Mahumetism.</hi> The Manifestation of all the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of the Divine Nature, with the Representation of
them unto Angels above, and the Church in this World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as he is the <hi>Image of the incisible God,</hi> in the Constitution
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58587:18"/>
of his Person, and the Discharge of his Office, are things
they regard not; yea, they despise and scorn what is
professed concerning them; for Pride and Contempt of
others were always the safest Covert of Ignorance; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it would seem strange, that Men should openly
boast of their own Blindness. But these Conceptions of
Mens Minds are influenced by that Unbelief of his Divine
Person, which maketh havock of Christianity at this Day
in the World.</p>
               <p>I speak of them, whose minds are better disposed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
heavenly things; and unto them I say, <hi>Wherefore
do you love Jesus Christ?</hi> for so you profess to do. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do you trust in him? Wherefore do you honour
him? Wherefore do you desire to be in Heaven with
him? Can you give a <hi>reason of this hope</hi> that is in you?
An account why you do all or any of these things? If
you cannot, all that you pretend towards him, is but
fancy and imagination; you <hi>fight uncertainly as men beating
the air;</hi> or is one of your reasons hereof, That in him
you <hi>do by Faith behold that glory of God,</hi> with the Holy
Properties of his Nature, and their Principal Operations,
in order unto your own Salvation and Blessedness, which
otherwise would have been eternally hid from you?
Hereon is he <hi>precious unto them that do believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LET us therefore, as many as <hi>are spiritual, be thus
minded.</hi> Let us make use of this <hi>Priviledge</hi> with rejoycing,
and be found in the discharge of this <hi>Duty</hi> with diligence:
For thus to <hi>behold the glory of Christ</hi> is both our priviledge
and our duty. The duties of the Law were a burthen
and a yoke; but those of the Gospel are Priviledges and
Advantages.</p>
               <p>IT is a Promise concerning the days of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that our <hi>eyes shall see the King in his beauty,</hi> Isa. 33
17. We shall behold the Glory of Christ in its Lustre
and Excellency: What is this <hi>Beauty</hi> of the King of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58587:18"/>
Saints? Is it not, that God is in him, and he is the great
representative of his Glory unto us? Wherefore in the
contemplation of this Glory consists the principal exercise
of Faith: And who can declare the Glory of this Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
That we who are born in Darkness, and deserved
to be cast out into utter Darkness, should be <hi>translated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this marvellous Light of the knowledge of the Glory of God
in the Face of Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHAT are all the stained Glories, the fading Beauties
of this World? Of all that the Devil shewed our Saviour
from the Mount? What are they in comparison of one
View of the Glory of God represented in Christ, and of
the Glory of Christ as his great Representative?</p>
               <p>THE most pernicious effect of Unbelief under the
preaching of the Gospel is, that together with an influence
of Power from Satan, <hi>it blinds the eyes of mens minds, that
they should not see this Glory of Christ,</hi> whereon they perish
eternally, 2 Cor. 4. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>BUT the most of those who at this day are <hi>called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
are strangers unto this duty: Our Lord Jesus Christ
told the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> that notwithstanding all their boasting
of the knowledge of God, they had not <hi>heard his voice
at any time, nor seen his shape;</hi> that is as <hi>Moses</hi> did. They
had no real acquaintance with him, they had no spiritual
view of his Glory; and so it is amongst our selves. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the general profession that is of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Christ, they are but few who thus behold his
Glory; and therefore few who are transformed into his
Image and Likeness.</p>
               <p>SOME Men speak much of the <hi>Imitation of Christ,</hi> and
<hi>following of his Example;</hi> and it were well if we could see
more of it really in effect. But no Man shall ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>like unto him,</hi> by bare <hi>Imitation</hi> of his Actions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that view or i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ition of his Glory which alone is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58587:19"/>
with a transforming power to <hi>change them into
the same image.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Truth is, the best of us all are wofully defective
in this Duty, and many are discouraged from it, because
a Pretence of it in some hath degenerated into Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
But we are loth at any time seriously to engage in
it, and come with an unwilling kind of Willingness, unto
the Exercise of our Minds in it.</p>
               <p>THOUGHTS of this <hi>Glory of Christ</hi> are too <hi>high</hi> for
us, or too <hi>hard</hi> for us, such as we cannot long delight in;
we turn away from them with a kind of Weariness; yet
are they of the same Nature in general with our behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Glory of Christ in Heaven, wherein there
shall be no weariness or Satiety unto Eternity. Is not the
Cause of it, that we are unspiritual or carnal, having
our Thoughts and Affections wonted to give Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto other things? For this is the principal Cause
of our Unreadiness and Incapacity to exercise our Minds
in and about the great Mysteries of the Gospel. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.
1, 2, 3. And it is so with us moreover, because we
do not stir up our selves with Watchfulness and Diligence
in continual Actings of Faith on this Blessed Object.
This is that which keeps many of us at so low an Ebb,
as unto the Powers of an Heavenly Life, and spiritual
Joys.</p>
               <p>DID we abound in this Duty, in this Exercise of
Faith, our Life in walking before God would be more
sweet and pleasant unto us; our spiritual Light and
St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ngth would have a daily Encrease; we should more
represent the Glory of Christ in our Ways and Walking,
than usually we do; and Death it self would be most
welcome unto us.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Angels</hi> themselves <hi>desire to look</hi> into the things of
the Glory of Christ, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 12. There is in them
Matter of Enquiry and Instruction for the most high and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58587:19"/>
holy Spirits in Heaven. The manifold Wisdom of God
in them is made known unto <hi>Principalities and Powers in
heavenly Places by the Church,</hi> Ephes. 3. 10. And shall we
neglect that which is the Object of <hi>Angelical</hi> Diligence to
enquire into; especially considering that we are more than
they concerned in it?</p>
               <p>IS Christ then thus glorious in our Eyes? Do we <hi>see
the Father in him,</hi> or by seeing of him? Do we sedulously,
daily contemplate on the Wisdom, Love, Grace, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Holiness, and Righteousness of God, as revealing
and manifesting themselves in him? Do we sufficiently
consider, that the <hi>immediate Vision</hi> of this Glory in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
will be our everlasting Blessedness? Doth the <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
View</hi> which we have of it here, encrease our Desires
after the <hi>perfect Soght</hi> of it above? With respect unto
these Enquiries, I shall briefly speak unto sundry sorts of
Men.</p>
               <p>SOME will say they understand not these things,
nor any Concernment of their own in them. If they are
true, yet are they <hi>Notions</hi> which they may safely be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Knowledge of; for so far as they can discern,
they have no Influence on Christian Practice, or Duties of
Morality. And the preaching of them doth but take off
the Minds of Men from more necessary Duties. But <hi>if
the Gospel be hid it is hid unto them that perish.</hi> And unto
the Objection I say:</p>
               <p>1. NOTHING is more fully and clearly revealed in
the Gospel, than that unto us Jesus Christ is the <hi>Image of
the invisible God</hi> that he is the <hi>Character of the Person of the
Father,</hi> so as that in <hi>seeing him,</hi> we see the Father also;
that we have the <hi>Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God
in his Face alone,</hi> as hath been proved. This is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Fundamental Mystery and Truth of the Gospel;
and which if it be not received, believed, owned, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Truths are useless unto our Souls. To refer all the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58587:20"/>
Testimonies that are given hereunto, to the Doctrine
which he taught, in Contradistinction unto his Person, as
acting in the Discharge of his Office, is <hi>Antievangilical, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian,</hi>
turning the whole Gospel into a Fable.</p>
               <p>2. IT is so, that the <hi>Light of Faith</hi> is given unto us
principally to enable us to <hi>behold the Glory of God in Christ;</hi>
to contemplate on it, as unto all the Ends of its Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation.
So is it expresly affirmed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. If we
have not this Light, as it is communicated by the Power
of God unto them that do believe, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 17, 18, 19.
we must be Strangers unto the whole Mystery of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>3. THAT in the <hi>beholding of the Glory of God in Christ,</hi>
we behold his Glory also. For herein is he infinitely glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
above the whole Creation, in that in and by him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
the Glory of the Invisible God is represented unto
us. Herein do our Souls live. This is that whereby the
Image of God is renewed in us, and we are made like
unto the First born.</p>
               <p>4. THIS is so far from being unnecessary unto <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Practice, and the sanctified Duties of Morality,</hi> that he
knows not Christ, he knows not the Gospel, he knows
not the Faith of the Catholick Church, who imagins that
they can be performed acceptably without it. Yea, this
is the Root whence all other <hi>Christian Duties</hi> do spring,
and whereon they grow, whereby they are distinguished
from the Works of Heathens. He is no Christian who
believes not that Faith in the Person of Christ is the Spring
of all Evangelical Obedience; or who knows not that
this Faith respects the Revelation of the Glory of God in
him.</p>
               <p>IF these things are so, as they are the most important
Truths of the Gospel, and whose Denial overthrows the
Foundation of Faith, and is ruinous to Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
Certainly it is our Duty to live in the constant Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58587:20"/>
of Faith with respect unto this Glory of Christ. And we
have sufficient Experience of what kind of Morality the
Ignorance of it hath produced.</p>
               <p>OTHERS there are who may be some way
<hi>Strangers,</hi> but are no way <hi>Enemies</hi> unto this Mystery, and
to the practical Exercise of Faith therein: Unto such I
shall tender the ensuing Directions.</p>
               <p>1. RECKON in your Minds, that this <hi>beholding of
the Glory of Christ</hi> by beholding the Glory of God, and
all his Holy Properties in him, is the greatest <hi>Priviledge</hi>
whereof in this Life we can be made Partakers. The
Dawning of Heaven is in it, and the <hi>First Fruits of Glory;</hi>
for this is <hi>Life Eternal</hi> to know the Father, and whom he
hath sent Christ Jesus, <hi>John</hi> 17. 3. Unless you value it,
unless you esteem it as such a <hi>Priviledge,</hi> you will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
it; and that which is not valued according unto its
Worth, is despised. It is not enough to think it a <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
an <hi>Advantage;</hi> but it is to be <hi>valued</hi> above other
things according unto its <hi>Greatness</hi> and Excellency. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
and Death say we have heard the Fame of it with our
Ears.</hi> Job 28. 22. And if we do <hi>no more,</hi> we shall die
Strangers unto it: We are to <hi>cry after this Knowledge, and
lift up our Voice for this Vnderstanding,</hi> if we design to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it.</p>
               <p>2. AS it is a great <hi>Priviledge</hi> which requires a due
Valuation; so it is a great <hi>Mystery</hi> which requires much
Spiritual Wisdom to the right understanding of it, and
to direct in its Practise, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4, 5. Flesh and Blood
will not reveal it unto us, but we must be taught of God,
to apprehend it, <hi>John 1. 12, 13. Mat.</hi> 16. 16, 17. Mere
unsanctified Reason will never enable us unto, nor guide
us in the Discovery of this Duty. Men are not so vain
as to hope for Skill and Understanding in the Mystery of
a secular Art or Trade, without the diligent Use of those
Means whereby it may be attained; and shall we suppose
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58587:21"/>
that we may be furnished with spiritual Skill and Wisdom
in this sacred Mystery, without Diligence in the Use of
the Means appointed of God for the attaining of it?
The Principal of them is <hi>Fervent Prayer.</hi> Pray then with
<hi>Moses,</hi> that God would <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ew you this his Glory;</hi> pray with
the Apostle, that <hi>the Eyes of your Vnderstandings may
be enlightened to behold it;</hi> Pray that the <hi>God of our Lord
Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory, may give unto you the spirit
of Wisdom and Revelation in the Knowledge of him.</hi> Fill
your Minds with spiritual Thoughts and Contrivances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them. Slothful and lazy Souls never obtain one
View of this Glory; the <hi>Lion in the way</hi> deters them
from attempting it. Being carnal, they abhor all Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in the Use of spiritual Means, such as Prayer and
Meditation on things unto them uneasie, unpleasing and
difficult. Unto others the Way partakes of the Nature
of the End; the Means of obtaining a View of the
Glory of Christ are of the same Kind, of the same
Pleasantness, with that View it self in their Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>3. LEARN the Use hereof from the Actings of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
vitious Habits.</hi> When the Minds of Men are vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
fixed on the pursuit of their Lusts, they will be
continually ruminating on the Objects of them, and have
a thousand Contrivances about them, until their <hi>Eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
full of an Adulteress and they cannot cease from sinning,</hi>
as the Apostle speaks. The Objects of their Lusts have
framed and raised an Image of themselves in their Minds,
and transformed them into their own Likeness, is this the
way of them who <hi>go down to the Chambers of Death?</hi> Do
they thus frame their Souls, and make them meet for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
until their Words, Gestures, Actions, proclaim
the Frame of their Minds unto all that look upon them?
And shalt we be slothful and negligent in the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Glory which transforms our Minds into its
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58587:21"/>
own Likeness, so as that the Eyes of our Understandings
shall be continually filled with it, until we see him and
behold him continually, so as never to cease from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y
Acts of Delight in him, and Love unto him?</p>
               <p>4. WOULD we then <hi>behold the Glory of God,</hi> as he
manifesteth it in and by the holy Properties of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
with their blessed Operations and Effects, without
which we have nothing of the Power of Religion in us,
whatever we pretend; this alone is the Way of it. Go
to the whole Creation, and all things contained in it;
they can say no more, but <hi>we have heard the Fam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and
Report of these things,</hi> and what we have heard we declare;
but it is but a <hi>little Portion</hi> of them that we are acquainted
withal. <hi>The Heavens</hi> indeed <hi>declare the Glory of God, and
the Firmament sheweth his handy Work. The invisible things
of God are understood by the things that are made, even his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Power and Godhead.</hi> But comparatively, it is but
<hi>little</hi> that we can hence learn of these things, as unto what
we may behold of them in Christ Jesus. How blind
herein was the best <hi>Philosopher</hi> in comparison of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> yea, of him who is least in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Heaven?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT herein it is required, that we rest not in the
<hi>Notion of this</hi> Truth, and a bare Assent unto the Doctrine
of it. The affecting Power of it upon our Hearts, is
that which we should aim at. Wherein doth the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
of the Saints above consist? Is it not herein, that
they behold and see the Glory of God in Christ? And
what is the Effect of it upon those blessed Souls? Doth it
not change them into the same Image, or make them
like unto Christ? Doth it not fill and satiate them with
Joy, Rest Delight, Complacency and ineffable Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction?
Do we expect, do we desire the same State of
Blessedness? It is our <hi>present View</hi> of the Glory of Christ
which is our <hi>Initiation</hi> thereinto, if we are exercised in it,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58587:22"/>
until we have an Experience of its <hi>Transforming Power</hi> in
our Souls.</p>
               <p>THESE things are, it may be, of little use unto some.
Such as are Babes in spiritual Knowledge and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
either because they are <hi>Carnal,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 1, 2. or
<hi>slothful in hearing,</hi> Heb. 5. 12, 13, 14. are not capable
of these Divine Mysteries. And therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
did in an especial manner declare this Wisdom of God
in a Mystery unto them that were <hi>perfect, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 6, 7.
That is, who were more grown in <hi>spiritual Knowledge, and
had their Senses exercised to discern Good and Evil.</hi> It is
unto them who are exercised in the Contemplation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
things, who delight to walk in the more retired
Paths of Faith and Love, to whom they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
               <p>SOME few Inferences from the Whole of what hath
been declared, shall put a Close to this part of our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
               <p>1. THE Holy Properties of the Divine Nature are
not only represented unto our Faith in Christ as unto their
own essential Glory, but as they are in the <hi>Exercise of their
Powers</hi> for the Salvation of the Church. In him do we
behold the Wisdom, Goodness, Love, Grace, Mercy
and Power of God acting themselves in the <hi>Contrivance,
Constitution,</hi> and efficacious <hi>Accomplishment</hi> of the great
Work of our Redemption and Salvation. This gives, as
unto us, an unutterable Lustre unto the Native Amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of the Divine Excellencies. The <hi>Wisdom</hi> and
<hi>Love</hi> of God are in themselves infinitely Glorious, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
Amiable; nothing can be added unto them, there
can be no encrease of their essential Glory. Howbeit as
they are eternally resident in the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
the same with it, we cannot so comprehend them,
as to have an endearing satiating View of their Glory:
But as they are exerted in the Work of the Redemption
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58587:22"/>
and Salvation of the Church, as they are expressed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
their blessed Effects unto the Souls of them
that do believe, which is done only in Christ; so the
Beams of their Glory shine unto us with unspeakable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment
and Joy, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. Hence the Apostle on
the Consideration of the Actings of the Holy Properties
of God in this blessed Work, falls into that Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<hi>O the Depth of the Riches both of the Wisdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God! How unsearchable are his Judgments, and his
Ways past finding out! For who hath not known the Mind of
the Lord, or who hath been his Counsellor, or who hath first
given unto him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
For of him, and through him, and to him are all things; to
whom be Glory for ever, Amen,</hi> Rom: 11. 33, 34, 35,
36.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>IN and through Christ we do believe in God,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.
24. This is the Life of our Souls. God himself in
the infinite Perfections of his Divine Nature, is the <hi>ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi>
Object of our Faith, but he is not here the <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi>
Object of it, but the Divine Way and Means of the
Manifestation of himself and them unto us, are so.
<hi>Through Christ we believe in God.</hi> By our Belief in him,
we come to place our Faith ultimately in God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and this we can no otherwise do, but by <hi>beholding
the Glory of God</hi> in him, as hath been declared.</p>
               <p>3. THIS is the only way whereby we may attain the
<hi>saving, sanctifying Knowledge of God;</hi> Without this, every
<hi>Beam of Divine Light</hi> that shines on us, or gleans from
without (as the <hi>Light shineth into</hi> Darkness when the
Darkness <hi>comprehendeth it</hi> not, Joh. 1. 5.) Every Spark
that ariseth from the Remainders of the Light of Nature
<hi>within,</hi> do rather amaze the Minds of Men, than lead
them into the saving Knowledge of God. So a Glance
of Light in a dark Night giving a transient View of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Objects, and passing away, doth rather amaze, than
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58587:23"/>
direct a Traveller, and leave him more exposed unto
wandring than before. Such were all those Notions of
the Divine Being and its Excellencies, which those who
<hi>boasted themselves to be wise</hi> among the Heathen embraced
and improved. They did but fluctuate in their Minds,
they did not transform them into the Image and Likeness
of God, as the saving Knowledge of him doth, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
               <p>SO the Apostle expresseth this Truth; <hi>Where is the
Wise? Where is the Scribe? Where is the Disputer of this
World? Hath not God made foolish the Wisdom of this World?
For after that in the Wisdom of God, the World by Wisdom
knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of Preaching to
save them that believe. For the Jews require a sign, and the
Gentiles seek after Wisdom; but we preach Christ crucified,
unto the Jews a Stumbling-block, and unto the Greeks Foolishness;
but unto them that are called both Jews and Greeks, Christ the
Power of God, and the Wisdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor, 1. 20, 21,
22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>AFTER it was evident unto all, that the <hi>World,</hi> the
<hi>Wise,</hi> the Studious, the Contemplative Part of it, in the
<hi>Wisdom of God,</hi> disposing them into that Condition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were left unto themselves, in their own Wisdom,
their Natural Light and Reason did not, could not come
to the saving Knowledge of God, but were pus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed up
into a Contempt of the only way of the Revelation of
himself, as Weakness and Folly; it pleased God then to
manifest all their <hi>Wisdom</hi> to be Folly; and to establish
the only Means of the Knowledge of himself in Christ
Jesus.</p>

               <p>THE Second Thing wherein we may <hi>behold the Glory
of Christ given him of his Father, is</hi> in the Mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Constitution of his Person, as he is God and Man in
one and the same Person. There are in him, in his one
single, <hi>individual Person,</hi> two distinct Natures; The one
Eternal, Infinite, Immense, Almighty, the Form and
Essence of God; The other having a beginning in Time,
Finite, Limited, Confined unto a certain Place, which
is our Nature, which he took on him when he was <hi>made
Flesh, and dwelt among us.</hi> The Declaration of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of this Glory, is a <hi>Part of my Discourse of the Person of
Christ,</hi> whereunto I refer the Reader: My present De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
is of another Nature.</p>
               <p>THIS is that <hi>Glory</hi> whose Beams are so illustrious, as
that the blind World cannot bear the Light and Beauty
of them. Multitudes begin openly to deny this <hi>Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Son of God,</hi> this <hi>Personal Union</hi> of God and Man
in their distinct Natures. They deny that there is either
Glory or Truth in it; and it will ere long appear, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
already to evidence it self what <hi>greater Multitudes</hi> there
are, who yet <hi>do not,</hi> who yet <hi>dare not</hi> openly reject the
Doctrine of it, who in Truth believe it not, nor see any
Glory in it. Howbeit this Glory, is the Glory of our
Religion, the Glory of the Church, the sole Rock where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it is built, the only Spring of present Grace, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:58587:24"/>
THIS is that Glory which the <hi>Angels</hi> themselves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to behold, the Mystery whereof they <hi>bow down to
look into,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 12. So was their Desire represented
by the <hi>Cherubims</hi> in the most holy Place of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle;
for they were a Shadow of the Ministry of Angels
in the Church. The Ark and Mercy Seat were a Type
of Christ in the Discharge of his Office; and these <hi>Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims</hi>
were made standing over them, as being in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
above; but earnestly looking down upon them in a
Posture of Reverence and Adoration. So they did of
Old, and in their present Contemplation of it consists no
small part of their Eternal Blessedness.</p>
               <p>HEREON depends the Ruine of Satan and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
His Sin, so far as we can conceive, consisted of
two Parts (1.) His <hi>Pride</hi> against the <hi>Person of the Son of
God,</hi> by whom he was created. <hi>For by him were all things
created that are</hi> (or were when first created) <hi>in Heaven,
whether they be Thrones or Dominions, or Principalities or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
Col. 1. 16. Against him he lifted up himself, which
was the Beginning of his Transgression. (2.) Envy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Mankind made in the Image of God, of the Son
of God the First-born. This compleated his Sin; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was now left whereon to act his Pride and Malice.
Unto his Eternal Confusion and Ruine God in infinite
Wisdom unites both the Natures he had sinned against,
in the one Person of the Son, who was the first Object of
his Pride and Malice. Hereby his Destruction is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>Ever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>sting Shame</hi> in the Discovery of his Folly,
wherein he would have contended with infinite Wisdom,
as well as Misery, by the Powers of the two Natures u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
in one Person.</p>
               <p>HERE lies the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the Church. The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the whole Old Creation was laid in an Act of
absolute Soveraign Power. Hereby God <hi>hanged the Earth
upon nothing.</hi> But the Foundation of the Church is on
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58587:24"/>
this Mysterious immoveable Rock; <hi>Thou art Christ, the
Son of the living God;</hi> on the most intimate Conjunction
of the two Natures, the Divine and Humane, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
infinitely distant, in the same Person.</p>
               <p>WE may name one place wherein it is gloriously
represented unto us, Isa. 9. 6. <hi>For unto us a Child is born,
unto us a Son is given, and the Government shall be on his
Shoulders; and his Name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor,
the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.</hi>
Here must the whole Church fall down and worship the
Author of this wonderful Contrivance, and captivating
their Understandings unto the Obedience of Faith, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
adore what they cannot comprehend.</p>
               <p>THIS was obscurly represented unto the Church of
old, <hi>Exo. 3. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And the Angel of the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
unto him in a Flame of Fire out of the midst of a Bush,
and he looked, and behold the Bush burned with Fire, and the
Bush was not consumed. And Moses said, I will now turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
and see this great Sight, why the Bush is not burnt. And
when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto
him out of the midst of the Bush, and said, Moses, Moses;
and he said, here am I. And he said, draw not nigh hither,

               <p>THIS <hi>Fire</hi> was a Type or Declaration of the Presence
of God in the Person of the Son. For with respect unto
the Father he is called an <hi>Angel,</hi> the Angel of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
but absolutely in himself, he was <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the <hi>God
of Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. And of his Presence the <hi>Fire</hi> was a

And although the Continuance of the <hi>Fire</hi> in the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58587:25"/>
                  <hi>Bush,</hi> was but for a short season, a present Appearance;
yet thence was God said to <hi>dwell</hi> in the Bush; <hi>The good will
of him that dwelt in the Bush;</hi> Deut. 33. 16. And this
is so spoken, because the being of the Fire in the Bush for a
season, was a Type of him in whom the <hi>fulness of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
dwelt bodily,</hi> and that for ever, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 9. Of him
who was <hi>made flesh and dwelt among us,</hi> Joh. 1. 14. The
Eternal <hi>Fire</hi> of the Divine Nature dwells in the <hi>Bush</hi> of
our frail Nature, yet is not consumed thereby. God
thus <hi>dwells in this Bush,</hi> with all his <hi>Good will</hi> towards Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>MOSES</hi> looked on this sight as a <hi>marvellous</hi> and <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous</hi>
thing. And if it were so in the <hi>Type,</hi> what is it in
the <hi>Truth,</hi> Substance and Reality of it?</p>
               <p>AND by Direction given unto him, to <hi>put off his
shooes,</hi> we are taught to cast away all fleshly <hi>Imaginations</hi>
and carnal Affections, that by pure Acts of Faith, we
may behold this Glory, the Glory of the only begotten of
the Father.</p>
               <p>I DESIGN not here to insist on the Explication, or
Confirmation of this glorious Truth concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the Person of Christ in and by his Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
What I can comprehend, what I do believe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it, I have fully declared in a large peculiar Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.
Here I take the Truth it self as known, or as it
may be thence learned. My present Business is only to
stir up the Minds of Believers unto a due <hi>Contemplation</hi> of
the Glory of Christ in the sacred Mysterious Constitution
of his Person, as God and Man in one. So much as we
abide herein, so much do <hi>we live by the Faith of the Son of
God;</hi> and God can by a Spirit of Wisdom and Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
open the Eyes of our Understandings, that we may
<hi>behold this Glory</hi> unto our ineffable Consolation and Joy.
And unto the diligent Discharge of our Duty herein, I
shall offer the ensuing Directions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:58587:25"/>
1. LET us get it fixed on our Souls, and in our Minds,
that this <hi>Glory of Christ</hi> in the Divine Constitution of his
Person, is the best, the most noble, useful, beneficial Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
that we can be conversant about in our Thoughts, or
or cleave unto in our Affections.</p>
               <p>What are all other things in comparison of the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Christ?</hi> In the Judgment of the great Apostle,
they are but <hi>Loss and Dung,</hi> Phil. 3. 8, 9, 10. So they
were to him, and if they are not so to us, we are carnal.</p>
               <p>WHAT is the World, and what are the things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
which most men spend their Thoughts about, and fix
their Affections on? The <hi>Psalmist</hi> gives his Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, in comparison of a View of this Glory of
Christ, <hi>Psal. 4. 6. Many say, who will shew us any good?</hi>
Who will give and help us to attain so much in and of
this World, as will give Rest and Satisfaction unto our
Minds? That is the good enquired after. But, saith he,
<hi>Lord lift up the Light of thy Countenance upon us.</hi> The
Light of the Glory of God in the Face of Christ Jesus,
is that satisfactory Good alone, which I desire and seek
after.</p>
               <p>THE Scripture reproacheth the Vanity and Folly of
the Minds of Men, in that <hi>they spend their Money for that
which is not Bread, and their Labour for that which profiteth
not.</hi> They ingage the Vigor of their Spirits about pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
things, when they have durable Substance and
Riches proposed unto them.</p>
               <p>HOW do Men for the most part exercise their
Minds? What are they conversant about in their
Thoughts?</p>
               <p>SOME by them <hi>make provision for the flesh, to fulfil it
in the Lusts thereof,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 14. They search about
continually in their Thoughts for Objects suited unto
their Lusts and carnal Affections, coyning, framing and
stamping of them in their Imaginations. They fix their
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58587:26"/>
Eyes with delight on Toads and Serpents, with all noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
filthy Objects; refusing in the mean time, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Beauty and Glory of the Light of the Sun. So
is it with all that spend their Thoughts about the Objects
of their sinful Pleasures, refusing to look up after one
view of this <hi>Glory of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SOME keep their Thoughts in continual Exercise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Things of this World, as unto the Advantages
and Emoluments which they expect from them. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
are they transformed into the Image of the World,
becoming earthly, carnal and vain. Is it because there
is <hi>no God in Israel that these Applications are made unto the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol
of Ekron?</hi> That there is no Glory, no desirableness in
Christ for Men to enquire after, and fix their Minds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Oh the blindness, the darkness, the folly of poor
sinners? <hi>Whom</hi> do they despise, and <hi>for what?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SOME of more refined parts and notional Minds, do
arise unto a sedulous Meditation on the Works of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Providence. Hence many excellent Discourses on
that Subject, adorned with Eloquence, are published a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us. And a Work this is worthy of our Nature,
and suited unto our rational Capacities; yea, the first end
of our natural Endowment with them. But in all these
things there is <hi>no Glory</hi> in comparison of what is proposed
unto us in the mysterious Constitution of the Person of
Christ. The Sun hath no Glory, the Moon and Stars no
Beauty, the Order and Influence of the Heavenly Bodies,
have no Excellency in comparison of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is that which the Psalmist designs to declare,
Psal. 8.</hi> O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy Name in all
the earth! Who hast set thy Glory above the heavens. When
I consider thy heavens, the work of thy Fingers, the Moon and
the Stars which thou hast ordained; what is Man that thou
art mindful of him, and the Son of man that thou visitest him?
For thou hast made him a little lower than the Angels, and hast
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58587:26"/>
crowned him with glory and honor; thou hast made him to
have Dominion over the work of thy hands, thou hast put all
things under his feet.</p>
               <p>HE is engaged in a Contemplation of the Glory of
God in his Works; and he concludes that the Fabrick
of Heaven, with the <hi>Moon and Stars</hi> therein (for it was
his Meditation by Night, when he beheld them) was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
glorious, and greatly to be admired. This casts
his Thoughts on the poor, weak, infirm Nature of Man,
which seems as nothing in comparison of those Glories
above: But immediately hereon falls into an Admiration
of the Wisdom, Goodness, and Love of God, <hi>exalting
that Nature</hi> incomparably above all the Works of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Person of Jesus Christ, as the Apostle expounds
this place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>THIS therefore is the highest, the best, the most
useful Object of our Thoughts and Affections. He who
hath had a real View of <hi>this Glory,</hi> though he know
himself to be a poor, sinful, dying <hi>Worm</hi> of the Earth,
yet would he not be an <hi>Angel</hi> in Heaven, if thereby he
should loose the sight of it; for this is the Center where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
all the Lines of the Manifestation of the Divine Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
do meet and rest.</p>
               <p>LOOK unto the things of this World, Wives, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
Possessions, Estates, Power, Friends, and Honor;
how amiable are they! How desirable unto the Thoughts
of the most of Men! But he who hath obtained a View
of the Glory of Christ, will in the midst of them all say,
<hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? There is none on Earth
that I desire besides thee,</hi> Psal. 73. 25. For <hi>who in the
Heavens can be compared unto the Lord? Who among the Sons
of the mighty, can be compared unto the Lord?</hi> Psal. 89. 6.</p>
               <p>HE himself out of his infinite Love and ineffable
Condescention, upon the Sight and View of his Church,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58587:27"/>
and his own Graces in her, wherewith she is adorned,
doth say; <hi>Thou hast ravished my Heart, my Sister, my Spouse,
thou hast ravished my Heart with one of thine Eyes, with one
Chain of thy Neck,</hi> Cant. 4. 8. How much more ought a
believing Soul, upon a View of the Glory of Christ, in
whom it pleased the Father, that all Fulness should dwell,
to say, Thou hast ravished my Heart, taken it away
from me, <hi>O thou whom my Soul loveth;</hi> One Glance of thy
glorious Beauty upon me, hath quite overcome me, hath
left no heart in me, unto things here below? If it be
not thus with us frequently, if we value not this Object
of our Minds and Affections, if we are not diligent in
looking up unto him, to behold his Glory, it is because
we are <hi>carnal,</hi> and not in any good measure partakers of
the promise, that <hi>our Eyes shall see the King in his Beauty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. OUR second Direction unto the same End is;
That <hi>we diligently study the Scripture, and the Revelations
that are made of this Glory of Christ therein.</hi> To behold it,
is not a Work of Fancy or Imagination. It is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
with an Image framed by the Art of Men <hi>without,</hi>
or that of our own Fancy <hi>within;</hi> but of Faith exercised
on Divine Revelations. This Direction he gives us him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Joh. 5. 39. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for they are they that
testifie of me.</hi> The way whereby this is done, is fully
set before us in the Example of the holy Prophets under
the old Testament, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>THIS Principle is always to be retained in our Minds
in <hi>reading of the Scripture,</hi> namely, that the Revelation
and Doctrine of the Person of Christ and his Office, is
the Foundation whereon all other Instructions of the
Prophets and Apostles for the edification of the Church
are built, and wherein to they are resolved, as is declared,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 20, 21, 22. So our Lord Jesus Christ himself
at large makes it manifest, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 26, 27, 45, 46.
Lay aside the Consideration hereof, and the Scriptures are

no such thing as they pretend unto; namely, a Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Glory of God in the Salvation of the Church;
nor are those of the Old Testament so at this Day unto
the <hi>Jews,</hi> who own not this Principle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13, 14,
15, 16. There are therefore such <hi>Revelations</hi> of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Glory of Christ treasured up in the Scripture,
from the beginning unto the end of it, as may exercise
the Faith and Contemplation of Believers in this World;
and shall never, during this Life, be fully discovered or
understood; and in Divine Meditations of these Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
doth much of the <hi>Life of Faith</hi> consist.</p>
               <p>THERE are three ways whereby the Glory of Christ
is represented unto us in the Scripture. First, by <hi>direct
Descriptions</hi> of his glorious Person and Incarnation. See
among other places, <hi>Gen. 3. 15. Psal. 2. 7, 8, 9. Psal.
45. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Psal. 68. 17, 18. Psal. 110. Isa. 6.
1, 2, 3, 4. Chap. 9. 6. Zech. 2. 8. Joh. 1. 1, 2, 3. Phil.
2. 6, 7, 8. Heb. 1. 1, 2, 3. Chap. 2. 14, 15, 16. Rev.</hi>
1. 17, 18. Secondly, by <hi>Prophecies,</hi> Promises and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Instructions concerning him, all leading unto the
Contemplation of his Glory, which are innumerable.
Thirdly, By the sacred Institutions of Divine Worship
under the Old Testament: For the end of them all was
to represent unto the Church the Glory of Christ in the
Discharge of his Office, as we shall see afterwards.</p>
               <p>WE may take notice of an Instance in one kind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Old Testament, and of one and another under the
New.</p>
               <p>HIS <hi>Personal Appearances</hi> under the Old Testament,
carried in them a Demonstration of his Glory: Such was
that in the Vision which <hi>Isaiah</hi> had, <hi>when he saw his Glory,
and spake of him,</hi> Chap. 6. 1, 2. <hi>I saw the Lord sitting upon
a Throne, high and lifted up, and his Train filled the Temple.
About it stood the Seraphims,</hi> &amp;c. It was a Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Glory of the Divine Presence of Christ fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58587:28"/>
his Humane Nature, the <hi>Temple of his Body,</hi> with a
<hi>Train</hi> of all glorious Graces. And if this <hi>Typical</hi> Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
of it was so glorious, as that the <hi>Seraphims</hi> were
not able stedfastly to behold it, but <hi>covered their Faces</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
its Appearance, <hi>v.</hi> 2. how exceeding glorious is it in
it self, as it is openly revealed in the Gospel!</p>
               <p>OF the same Nature are the immediate Testimonies
given unto him from Heaven in the New Testament: So
the Apostle tells us, <hi>he received from God the Father, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
and glory, when there came such a Voice unto him from
the excellent Glory, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well
pleased, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 17. The Apostle intends the Time of
his Transfiguration in the Mount, for so he adds,
<hi>Ver. 18. And this Voice which came from Heaven, we heard
who were with him in the holy Mount.</hi> Howbeit, at sundry
other times he had the same Testimony, or to the same
purpose, from God, even the Father in Heaven. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God gave him <hi>Honor and Glory,</hi> which all those that
believe in him should behold and admire; not only those
who heard this Testimony with their bodily Ears, but all
unto whom it is testified in the Scripture, are obliged to
look after, and contemplate on the Glory of Christ, as
thus revealed and proposed. From the Throne of his
Excellency by audible Voices, by visible Signs, by the
opening of the Heavens above, by the descent of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit upon him, God testified unto him as his eternal
Son, and gave him therein Honor and Glory. The
Thoughts of this Divine Testimony, and the Glory of
Christ therein, hath often filled the Hearts of some with
Joy and Delight.</p>
               <p>THIS therefore in reading and studying the holy
Scripture, we ought with all diligence to search and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
unto, as did the Prophets of old, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 11. 12. if
we intend by them to be made <hi>wise unto Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:58587:28"/>
WE should herein be as the <hi>Merchant man</hi> that seeks
for Pearls; he seeks for all sorts of them, but when he
hath found one of <hi>Great Price,</hi> he parts with all to make
it his own, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 45, 46. The Scripture is the Field,
the Place, the Mine where we search and dig for
Pearls; see <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Every sacred Truth
that is made effectual unto the good of our Souls, is a
Pearl whereby we are enriched; but when we meet with,
when we fall upon this Pearl of price, the Glory of
Christ; this is that which the Soul of a Believer cleaves
unto with joy.</p>
               <p>THEN do we find <hi>Food for our Souls</hi> in the Word of
Truth, then do we taste how gracious the Lord is therein,
then is the Scripture full of Refreshment unto us, as a
Spring of Living Water, when we are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aken into blessed
Views of the Glory of Christ therein. And we are in
the best Frame of Duty, when the principal Motive in
our Minds to contend earnestly for retaining the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Scripture, against all that would deprive us of
it, or discourage us from a daily diligent search into it, is
this, that they would take from us the only <hi>Glass</hi> wherein
we may behold the Glory of Christ. This is the Glory
of the Scripture, that it is the great, yea, the <hi>only</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Means of representing unto us the Glory of Christ;
and he is the Sun in the Firmament of it, which only
hath Light in it self, and communicates it unto all other
things besides.</p>
               <p>3. ANOTHER Direction unto this same End, is,
That having attained the Light of the Knowledge of the
Glory of Christ from the Scripture, or by the Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Truth in the preaching of the Gospel, <hi>we
would esteem it our Duty frequently to meditate thereon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WANT hereof is that fundamental Mistake which
keeps many among us so low in their Grace, so regardless
of their Priviledges. They hear of these things, they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58587:29"/>
unto their Truth, at least they do not gain say them:
but they never <hi>solemnly meditate</hi> upon them. This they
esteem a Work that is <hi>above</hi> them, or are <hi>ignorant</hi> totally
of it, or esteem themselves not much concerned in it, or
<hi>dislike</hi> it as <hi>Fanatacism.</hi> For it is that which no Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
can ingage a carnal Mind to delight in. The
Mind must be spiritual and holy, freed from earthly Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and Encumbrances, raised above things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that can in a due manner meditate on the Glory
of Christ. Therefore are the most Strangers unto this
Duty, because they will not be at the Trouble and
Charge of that Mortification of earthly Affections, that
Extirpation of sensual Inclinations, that Retirement from
the Occasions of Life, which are required there unto.
See the <hi>Treatise of Spiritual-mindedness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is to be feared that there are some who profess
Religion with an <hi>Appearance of Strictness,</hi> who never se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
themselves from all other Occasions to <hi>meditate on
Christ and his Glory.</hi> And yet with a strange Inconsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Apprehensions, they will profess that they desire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more, than to <hi>behold his Glory in Heaven for ever.</hi> But
it is evident even in the Light of Reason, that these things
are irreconcilable. It is impossible that he who never me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditates
with delight on the Glory of Christ here in this
World, who labors not to behold it by <hi>Faith</hi> as it is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Scripture, should ever have any real <hi>gracious
Desire</hi> to behold it in Heaven. They may love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the Fruition of their own Imaginations, they cannot
do so of the Glory of Christ whereof they are ignorant,
and wherewith they are unacquainted. It is therefore to
be lamented that Men can find time for, and have incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
to think and meditate on other things, it may
be earthly and vain; but have neither Heart nor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
nor Leasure to meditate on this glorious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
What is the Faith and Love which such Men
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58587:29"/>
profess? how will they find themselves deceived in the
Issue?</p>
               <p>4. LET your <hi>occasional Thoughts of Christ be many,</hi> and
multiplied every Day, he is not far from us; we may
make a speedy Address unto him at any time: so the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
informs us, <hi>Rom. 10. 6, 7, 8. Say not in thine heart
who shall ascend into Heaven (that is to bring Christ down from
above) or who shall descend into the deep; that is, to bring up
Christ again from the dead; for the word is nigh thee, even in thy
mouth and in thy heart.</hi> The things that Christ did, were
done at a Distance from us, and they are long since past.
But saith the Apostle, the <hi>Word of the Gospel</hi> wherein these
things are revealed, and whereby an Application is made
of them unto our Souls, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>nigh unto us, even in our hearts;</hi>
that is, if we are true Believers, and have mixed the
Word with Faith: and so it exhibiteth Christ and all
the Benefits of his Mediation unto us. If therefore this
Word is in our Hearts, Christ is nigh unto us. If we
turn at any time into our selves to converse with the
Word that abideth in us, there we shall find him ready
to receive us into Communion with himself, that is, in
the Light of the Knowledge of Christ which we have by
the Word, we may have sudden occasional Thoughts of
him continually; and where our Minds and Affections are
so filled with other things, that we are not ready for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with him who is thus nigh unto us by the Word, we
are spiritually indisposed.</p>
               <p>SO to manifest how nigh he is unto us, it is said that
<hi>he stands at the door and knocks,</hi> Rev. 3. 20. in the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
tender that he makes of himself and his Grace unto our
Souls. For he is always accompanied with the glorious
Train of his Graces, and if they are not received, he
himself is not so. It is to no purpose to boast of Christ,
if we have not an Evidence of his Graces in our
Hearts and Lives. But unto whom he is the <hi>Hope
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58587:30"/>
of Future Glory,</hi> unto them he is the <hi>Life</hi> of present grace.</p>
               <p>SOMETIMES it may be, that he is withdrawn from
us, so as that we cannot <hi>hear his Voice, nor behold his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi>
nor obtain any sence of his Love, though we
seek him with diligence. In this state all our thoughts
and Meditations concerning him will be barren and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
bringing in no spiritual Refreshment into our
Souls. And if we learn to be content with such life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
in affecting thoughts of him, as bring in no expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of his Love, nor give us a real View of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his Person, we shall wither away as unto all the
power of Religion.</p>
               <p>WHAT is our Duty in this Case, is so fully expressed
by the <hi>Spouse in the Canticles,</hi> as represents it plainly unto
the Minds of Believers, who have any Experience of
these things, Chap. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>By night on my Bed
I sought him whom my Soul loveth: I sought him, but I found
him not. I will rise now, and go about the City in the Streets,
and in the broad ways, I will seek him whom my soul loveth:
I sought him, but I found him not. The Watch-men that go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the City found me, to whom I said, saw ye him whom my
soul loveth? It was but a little I passed from them, but I found
him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him
go.</hi> The like account she gives of her self, and of her
Behaviour on the like Occasion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>THIS is the substance of what by this Example we
are instructed unto. The Lord Christ is pleased some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to withdraw himself from the <hi>spiritual Experience</hi> of
Believers; as unto any refreshing sense of his Love, or
the fresh communications of consolatory Graces. Those
who never had Experience of any such thing, who never
had any refreshing communion with him, cannot be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of his <hi>Absence,</hi> they never were so of his <hi>Presence.</hi>
But those whom he hath visited, to whom he hath <hi>given
of his Loves,</hi> with whom he hath made his <hi>Abode,</hi> whom
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58587:30"/>
he hath refreshed, relieved and comforted, in whom he
hath lived in the Power of his Grace, they know what it
is to be <hi>forsaken</hi> by him, though but <hi>for a moment.</hi> And
their Trouble is increased, when they seek him with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in the wonted ways of obtaining his presence, and
cannot find him. Our Duty in this case is, to presevere
in our Enquiries after him in Prayer, Meditation, Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Reading, and Hearing of the Word, in all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of Divine Worship, private and publick, in dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Obedience, until we find him, or he return unto us,
as in former Days.</p>
               <p>IT were well if all Churches and Possessors now would
manifest the same Diligence herein, as did the Church of
old in this Example. Many of them, if they are not
hardened by the Deceitfulness of Sin, cannot but be sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that the Lord Christ is variously withdrawn from
them, if ever they had experience of the Power of his
Presence: Yet are the generality of them far from the
frame of heart here described in the <hi>Spouse;</hi> for they are sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
careless, negligent, and stir not up themselves to enquire
after him, or his return unto their Souls. So was it with
<hi>Laodicea</hi> of old, so was it with <hi>Sardis,</hi> and so it is to be
feared that it is with many at present. But to return.</p>
               <p>GENERALLY Christ is <hi>nigh unto Believers,</hi> and of a
ready Access; and the principal Actings of the Life of
Faith, consists in the frequency of our Thoughts concerning
him; for hereby <hi>Christ liveth</hi> in us, as he is said to do, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.
20. This we cannot do, unless we have frequent thoughts
of him, and converse with him. It is often said among
Men, that one lives in another; this cannot be but
where the Affections of one are so ingaged unto another,
that night and day he thinks of him, and is thereby as it
were present with him. So ought it to be between Christ
and Believers. He dwells in them by Faith; but the Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of this Life in them (as where-ever Life is, it will be in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58587:31"/>
act and exercise) are proportionable unto their Thoughts
of him, and Delight in him.</p>
               <p>IF therefore we would <hi>behold the Glory of Christ,</hi> the
present direction is, That on all occasions, and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when there are no occasions for it by the performance
of other Duties, we would abound in thoughts of Him
and his Glory. I intend not at present fixed and stated
<hi>Meditations,</hi> which were spoken unto before; but such
<hi>Thoughts</hi> as are more transient, according as our opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
are. And a great Rebuke it ought to be unto us,
when Christ hath at any time in a day been long out of
our Minds. The Spouse affirms, That <hi>ere she was aware,
her soul made her as the Chariots of Amminadab,</hi> Cant. 7.
12. It so fell out, that when she had no thoughts, no
design or purpose for attendance or communion with
Christ, that she was surprised into a readiness and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
unto it. So will it be with them that love him in
sincerity. Their own <hi>Souls,</hi> without previous designs or
outward occasions, will frequently engage them in holy
thoughts of him, which is the most eminent character of
a truly spiritual Christian.</p>
               <p>4. THE next Direction is, That all our Thoughts
concerning Christ and his Glory, should be accompanied
with <hi>Admiration, Adoration, and Thanksgiving.</hi> For this
is such an Object of our Thoughts and Affections, as in
this Life we can never fully comprehend; an Ocean
whose Depths we cannot look into. If we are spiritually
renewed, all the Faculties of our Souls are enabled by
Grace to exert their respective powers towards this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Object. This must be done in various Duties, by
the Exercise of various Graces, as they are to be acted
by the distinct powers of the Faculties of our Minds.
This is that which is intended, where we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>to love the Lord with all our souls, with all our minds, with
all our strength.</hi> All the distinct powers of our Souls,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58587:31"/>
are to be acted by distinct Graces and Duties, in cleaving
unto God by Love. In Heaven, when we are come to
our Center, that State of Rest and Blessedness which our
Nature is ultimately capable of, nothing but one infinite
invariable Object of our Minds and Affections received
by <hi>Vision,</hi> can render that State uninterrupted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable.
But whilst we are here, we <hi>know,</hi> or <hi>see but
in part,</hi> and we must also act our Faith and Love, on
parts of that Glory, which is not at once entirely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
unto us, and which as yet we cannot comprehend.
Wherefore we must act various Graces in great Variety
about it; some at one time, some at another, according
unto the powers of all our renewed Faculties. Of this
fort are those mentioned of <hi>Adoration, Admiration,</hi> and
<hi>Thanksgiving;</hi> which are those Acts of our Minds where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
all others do issue, when the Object is incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
For unto them we are enabled by Grace.</p>
               <p>ONE end of his illustrious coming unto the Judgment
of the last Day is, that he may be <hi>admired in all them that
believe, 2 Thes.</hi> 1. 11. Even Believers themselves shall be
filled with an overwhelming Admiration upon his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Appearance. Or if the meaning be, not that he
shall be admired <hi>by them,</hi> but admired <hi>in them,</hi> because of
the mighty Works of his Grace and Power in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
Sanctification, Resurrection, and Glory, it is
to the same purpose, he <hi>comes to be admired.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the prospect which we have of that Glory,
ought our Admiration to be.</p>
               <p>AND this <hi>Admiration</hi> will issue in <hi>Adoration</hi> and
<hi>Thanksgiving;</hi> whereof we have an eminent Instance and
Example in the whole Church of the Redeemed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>They sang a new Song, saying,
Worthy art thou to receive the Book, and to open the Seals
thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast bought us unto God by
thy Blood, out of every Tribe, and Tongue, and People, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58587:32"/>
and hast made us Kings and Priests unto God, and we
shall reign upon the Earth. And I saw and heard the Voice of
many Angels round about the Throne, and of the living Creatures,
and of the Elders, and the Number of them was ten thousand
times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands, saying with a
loud Voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and Riches, and Wisdom, and Strength, and Honour, and
Glory, and Blessing; and every Creature that is in Heaven, and
in the Earth, and under the Earth, and that are in the Sea,
and all things in them heard I saying, Blessing, and Honour,
and Power, and Glory, be unto him that sits on the Throne, and
unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Design of this Discourse is no more, but that
when by Faith we have attained a View of the Glory of
Christ, in our Contemplations on his Person, we should
not pass it over as a Notion of Truth which we assent
unto, namely, that he is thus glorious in himself; but
endeavor to affect our Hearts with it, as that wherein our
own principal Interest doth lie; wherein it will be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
unto the <hi>Transformation</hi> of our Souls into his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
               <p>BUT some it may be will say, at least I fear some
may truly say, That these things do not belong unto
them, they do not find that ever they had any Benefit
by them: They hope to be saved as well as others by
the Mediation of Christ; but as unto this <hi>beholding of his
Glory</hi> by constant Meditation and Actings of Faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
they know nothing of it, nor are concerned in it.
The Doctrine which they are taught out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
concerning the Person of Christ, they give their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
unto; but his Glory they hope they shall see in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World, here they never yet enquired after it.</p>
               <p>SO it will be. It is well if these things be not only
<hi>neglected,</hi> because the Minds of Men are carnal, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
discern spiritual things; but also <hi>despised,</hi> because they
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58587:32"/>
have an Enmity unto them. It is not for all to walk in
these retired Paths. Not for them who are negligent and
slothful, whose Minds are earthly and carnal. Nor can
they herein sit at the Feet of Christ with <hi>Mary,</hi> when she
<hi>chose the better part,</hi> who like <hi>Martha,</hi> are <hi>cumbred about
many things</hi> here in this World. Those whose principal
Design is to add unto their present Enjoyments (in the
midst of the prosecution whereof, they are commonly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from them, so as that their Thoughts do perish, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
not accomplished) will never understand these things.
Much less will they do so, whose Work it is to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for the Flesh to fulfil it in the Lusts thereof.</p>
               <p>THEY must make it their Design to be heavenly
minded, who will find a Relish in these things. Those
who are Strangers unto holy Meditation in general, will
be Strangers unto this Mystery in a peculiar manner.</p>
               <p>SOME Men can think of the World, of their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the manifold Occasions of Life; but as unto the
things that are above and within the Vail, they are not
concerned in them.</p>
               <p>WITH some it is otherwise. They profess their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to <hi>behold the Glory of Christ by Faith;</hi> but they find it,
as they complain, too high and difficult for them. They
are at a Loss in their Minds, and even overwhelmed, when
they begin to <hi>view his Glory.</hi> They are like the Disciples,
who saw him in his <hi>Transfiguration;</hi> they were filled with
Amazement, and knew not what to say, or said they
knew not what. And I do acknowledge, that the <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of our Minds in the comprehension of this Eternal
Glory of Christ, and their Instability in Meditations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whence we cannot stedfastly look on it, or behold it,
gives us an afflicting abasing Consideration of our present
State and Condition. And I shall say no more unto this
Case but this alone: When Faith can no longer hold
open the Eyes of our Understandings unto the beholding
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58587:33"/>
of the Son of Righteousness shining in his Beauty, nor
exercise orderly Thoughts about this incomprehensible
Object, it will betake it self unto that holy <hi>Admiration</hi>
which we have spoken unto; and therein it will
put it self forth in pure Acts of Love and Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>

relating immediately unto the Person of Christ in
it self, may seem to have somewhat of Difficulty in them,
unto such whose Mind are not duly exercised in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of Heavenly Things. Unto others they are
evident in their own Experience, and instructive unto them
that are willing to learn. That which remains will be
yet more plain unto the Understanding and Capacity of
the meanest Believer. And this is the Glory of Christ in
his Office of Mediator, and the Discharge thereof.</p>
                  <p>IN our <hi>beholding of the Glory of Christ</hi> herein, doth the
Exercise of Faith in this Life principally consist; so the
Apostle declares it, <hi>Phil. 3. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Yea doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
and I count all things loss for the Excellency of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Christ Jesus my Lord.—To know him, and the
Power of his Resurrection, and the Fellowship of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and to be made conformable unto his Death.</hi> This
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58587:33"/>
therefore we must treat of somewhat more at
large.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THERE is one God,</hi> saith the Apostle, and one <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
between God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus. 1 Tim.</hi>
2. 5. In that great difference between God and Man
occasioned by our Sin and Apostacy from him, which of
it self could issue in nothing but the utter Ruine of the
whole Race of Mankind, there was none in Heaven or
Earth in their Original Nature and Operations, who was
meet or able to make up a <hi>Righteous Peace</hi> between them.
Yet must this be done by a <hi>Mediator,</hi> or cease for
ever.</p>
                  <p>THIS Mediator could not be God himself absolutely
considered; <hi>for a Mediator is not of one, but God is one;
Gal.</hi> 3. 20. Whatever God might do herein in a way
of Sovereign Grace, yet he could not do it in the way of
Mediation, which yet was necessary unto his own Glory,
as we have at large discoursed elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>AND as for <hi>Creatures,</hi> there was none in Heaven or
Earth that was meet to undertake this Office. <hi>For if one
Man sin against another, the Judge shall judge herein; but if
a Man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him?</hi>
1 Sam. 2. 25. <hi>There is not any days-man betwixt us to lay
his hand upon us both,</hi> Job 9. 33.</p>
                  <p>IN this State of Things the Lord Christ as the Son of
God said, <hi>Lo I come to do thy Will, O God; sacrifice and
burnt offerings thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepared
me, and Lo I come to do thy Will,</hi> Heb. 10. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. By
the Assumption of our Nature into Union with himself,
in his one Divine Person he became every way meet for
the Discharge of this Office, and undertakes it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
                  <p>THAT which we enquire after at present, is the
Glory of Christ herein, and how we may behold that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58587:34"/>
Glory. And there are three things wherein we may
take a prospect of it.</p>
                  <p>1. IN his Susception of this Office.</p>
                  <p>2. In his Discharge of it.</p>
                  <p>3. In the Event and Consequence thereof or what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
thereon.</p>
                  <p>IN the Susception of this Office we may behold the
Glory of Christ. (1.) In his <hi>Condescention.</hi> (2.) In his
<hi>Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. WE may behold his Glory in his <hi>Infinite Condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to take this Office on him, and our Nature to be his
own unto that end. It did not befall him by Lot or
Chance; it was not <hi>imposed</hi> on him against his Will; it
belonged not unto him by any <hi>Necessity</hi> of Nature or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
he stood not in need of it; it was no addition unto
him; but of his own Mind and Accord he graciously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended
unto the Susception and Discharge of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So the Apostle expresseth it,</hi> Phil. 2. 5, 6, 7, 8. Let
this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who being
in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God;
but made himself of no reputation, and took on himself the form
of a Servant, and was made in the likeness of Men; and being
found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient

                  <p>IT was the <hi>Mind that was in Jesus Christ,</hi> which is

                     <hi>humbling of himself, Psal.</hi> 113. 6.</p>
                  <p>WHEREFORE the Susception of our Nature for the
Discharge of the Office of Mediation therein, was an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58587:34"/>
Condescention</hi> in the Son of God, wherein he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
Glorious in the Eyes of Believers.</p>
                  <p>AND I shall do these three Things. (1.) Shew in
general the <hi>Greatness</hi> of this Condescention. (2.) Declare
the <hi>Especial Nature</hi> of it. And (3.) Take what view we
are able of the <hi>Glory of Christ</hi> therein,</p>
                  <p>1. SUCH is the transcendent Excellency of the Divine
Nature, that it is said of God, that <hi>he dwelleth on high, and
humbleth himself to behold the things that are in Heaven, and
in the Earth,</hi> Psal. 113. 5, 6. He <hi>condescends</hi> from the
Prerogative of his Excellency, to behold, to look upon,
to take notice of the most glorious Things in Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
and the greatest Things in the Earth below. All
his Respect unto the Creatures, the most glorious of
them, is an Act of <hi>Infinite Condescention.</hi> And it is so on
Two Accounts.</p>
                  <p>1. BECAUSE of the <hi>Infinite Distance</hi> that is between
his Essence, Nature, or Being, and that of the Creatures.
Hence <hi>all Nations before him, are as the Drop of a Bucket,
and are counted as the small Dust of the Ballance; yea,
that they are as nothing, that they are accounted unto him
less than nothing, and vanity.</hi> All Being is essentially in
him, and in comparison thereunto, all other things are
as <hi>nothing.</hi> And there are no Measures, there is no
Proportion between <hi>infinite being</hi> and <hi>nothing;</hi> Nothing
that should induce a Regard from the one unto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Wherefore the Infinite, Essential Greatness of the
Nature of God, with its Infinite Distance, from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of all Creatures thereby, causeth all his Dealings
with them to be in the way of <hi>Condescention</hi> or humbling
himself. So it is expressed, <hi>Isa. 57. 15. Thus saith the
high and lofty one who inhabiteth Eternity, I dwell in the high
and holy Place, with him also who is of a contrite and humble
Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the humble, and to revive the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58587:35"/>
heart of the contrite ones.</hi> He is so the high and losty one,
and so inhabiteth Eternity, or existeth in his own Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Being, that it is an Act of mere Grace in him, to
take notice of things below; and therefore he doth it
in an especial manner of those whom the World doth most
despise.</p>
                  <p>2. IT ariseth from his <hi>Infinite Self-Sufficiency</hi> unto all
the Acts and Ends of his own Eternal Blessedness. What
we have a Regard unto, what we respect and desire, it is
that it may add unto our Satisfaction. So it is, so it
must be with every Creature; no Creature is self-uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
unto its own Blessedness. The humane Nature of
Christ himself in Heaven is not so; it lives in God, and
God in it, in a full dependance on God, and in receiving
blessed and glorious Communications from him. No ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Creature, Angel or Man, can do, think, act any
thing, but it is all to add to their Perfection and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
they are not <hi>Self-ufficient.</hi> God alone wants
nothing, stands in need of nothing, nothing can be added
unto him, seeing he <hi>giveth unto all Life and Breath, and all
things,</hi> Act. 17. 25. The whole Creation in all its
Excellency cannot contribute one Mite unto the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
or Blessedness of God. He hath it all in Infinite
Perfection from himself and his own Nature; our Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
extends not unto him; <hi>A Man cannot profit God, as he
may profit his Neighbour. If thou sinnest, what dost thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him? and if thy Transgressions are multiplied, what dost
thou unto him?</hi> (God loseth nothing of his own Self-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
and Blessedness therein, by all this) <hi>and if thou be
righteous, what givest thou unto him, or what receiveth he at
thy hand?</hi> Job 35. 6, 7, 8. And from hence also it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
that all Gods concernment in the Creation, is by an
Act of Condescention.</p>
                  <p>HOW glorious then is the <hi>Condescention</hi> of the Son of
God in his <hi>Susception of the Office of Mediation?</hi> For if such
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58587:35"/>
be the Perfection of the Divine Nature, and its distance so
absolutely Infinite from the whole Creation, and if such
be his Self sufficiency unto his own Eternal Blessedness,
as that nothing can be taken from him, nothing added
unto him, so that every Regard in him unto any of the
Creatures, is an Act of <hi>Self-umiliation</hi> and <hi>Condescention</hi>
from the Prerogative of his Being and State; what
Heart can conceive, what Tongue can express the Glory
of that <hi>Condescention</hi> in the Son of God, whereby he took
our Nature upon him, took it to be his own, in order
unto a discharge of the Office of Mediation on our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half?</p>
                  <p>BUT that we may the better behold the Glory of
Christ herein, we may briefly consider the <hi>Especial
Nature</hi> of this Condescention, and wherein it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.</p>
                  <p>BUT whereas not only the Denial, but Misapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
hereof have pestered the Church of God in all Ages,
we must in the first place reject them, and then declare
the Truth.</p>
                  <p>1. THIS <hi>Condescention</hi> of the Son of God did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in a <hi>laying aside, or parting with,</hi> or <hi>separation from</hi> the
Divine Nature, so as that he should cease to be God, by
being Man. The Foundation of it lay in this, that <hi>he
was in the form of God, and counted it not robbery to be equal
with God,</hi> Phil. 2. <hi>v.</hi> 6. That is, being really and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
God in his Divine Nature, he professed himself
therein to be equal with God or the Person of the Father.
He was in the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that is, he was God, partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant
of the Divine Nature, for God hath no <hi>Form</hi> but
that of his Essence and Being; and hence he was equal
with God, in Authority, Dignity and Power. Because
he was in the Form of God, he must be equal with God,
for there is <hi>Order</hi> in the Divine Persons, but no <hi>Inequality</hi> in
the Divine Being. So the <hi>Jews</hi> understood him, that when
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58587:36"/>
he said, <hi>God was his Father, he made himself equal with God.</hi>
For in his so saying, he ascribed unto himself equal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
with the Father, as unto all Divine Operations, <hi>My
Father,</hi> saith he, <hi>worketh hitherto, and I work,</hi> Joh. 5. 17,
18. And they by whom his Divine Nature is denied,
do cast this <hi>Condescention of Christ</hi> quite out of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as that which hath no Reality or Substance in it.
But we shall speak of them afterwards.</p>
                  <p>BEING in this state, it is said that he <hi>took on him the
form of a servant, and was found in fashion as a Man,</hi> ver. 7.
This is his Condescention. It is not said, that he ceased
to be in the Form of God; but continuing so to be, he
<hi>took on him the form of a Servant</hi> in our Nature: He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
what he was not, but he ceased not to be what he
was: so he testifieth of himself, Joh. 3. 13. <hi>No man hath
ascended up into heaven, but he that came down from heaven, the
Son of man which is in heaven.</hi> Although he was then on Earth
as the Son of Man; yet he ceased not to be God thereby;
in his Divine Nature he was then also in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>HE who <hi>is God,</hi> can no more be <hi>not God,</hi> than he who
is <hi>not God</hi> can <hi>be God:</hi> And our difference with the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
herein is, we believe that Christ being God, was
made <hi>Man</hi> for our Sakes; they say, that being only a
Man, he was <hi>made a God</hi> for his own sake.</p>
                  <p>THIS then is the foundation of the Glory of Christ
in this Condescention, the Life and Soul of all heavenly
Truth and Mysteries; namely, that the <hi>Son of God</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
in <hi>time</hi> to be what he was not, the <hi>Son of Man;</hi>
ceased not thereby to be what he was, even the <hi>Eternal</hi>
Son of God. Wherefore,</p>
                  <p>2. MUCH less did this Condescention consist in the
<hi>Conversion of the Divine Natura into the Humane,</hi> which was
the Imagination of some of the <hi>Arians</hi> of old, and we have
yet (to my own knowledg) some that follow them in
the same Dotage. They say that the <hi>Word which was in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58587:36"/>
the Beginning,</hi> by which all things were made, being in it
self an Effect of the Divine Will and Power, was in the
fulness of time <hi>turned into Flesh;</hi> that is, the <hi>Substance</hi> of
it was so, as the <hi>Water</hi> in the Miracle wrought by our
Saviour, was turned into <hi>Wine;</hi> for by an Act of the
Divine Power of Christ it ceased to be <hi>Water</hi> substantially,
and was <hi>Wine</hi> only; not Water mixed with Wine: So
these Men suppose a <hi>Substantial Change</hi> of the one Nature
into the other, of the divine Nature into the humane;
like what the Papists imagine in their <hi>Trasubstantiation:</hi> So
they say God was made Man, his Effence being turned
into that of a Man.</p>
                  <p>BUT this no way belongs unto the Condescention of
Christ. We may call it <hi>Ichabod,</hi> it hath <hi>no Glory</hi> in it. It
destroys both his Natures, and leaves him a Person in
whom we are not concerned. For according unto this
Imagination, that <hi>Divine Nature</hi> wherein he was in the
Form of God, did in its own Form cease to be, yea,
was utterly destroyed, as being <hi>substantially</hi> changed into
the Nature of Man; as the <hi>Water</hi> did cease to be, when
it was turned into <hi>Wine;</hi> and that humane Nature which
was made thereof, hath no Alliance or Kindred unto us,
or our Nature, seeing it was not <hi>made of a Woman,</hi> but of
the Substance of the Word.</p>
                  <p>3. THERE was not in this <hi>Condescention,</hi> the least
<hi>Change</hi> or Alteration in the Divine Nature. <hi>Eutiches</hi> and
those that followed him of old, conceived that the two
Natures of Christ, the <hi>Divine and Humane were mixed</hi> and
compounded as it were into one: And this could not be
without an Alteration in the divine Nature, for it would
be made to be essentially what it was not; for one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath but one and the same Essence.</p>
                  <p>BUT as we said before; altho the Lord Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his Person was made to be what he was not before,
in that our Nature hereby was made to be his, yet his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58587:37"/>
Nature was not so: There is in it neither <hi>variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
nor shadow of turning.</hi> It abode the same in him in all
its Essential Properties, Actings and Blessedness, as it was
from Eternity. It neither did, acted, nor suffered any
thing, but what is proper unto the Divine Being: The
Lord Christ did and suffered many things in Life and
Death, in his own Person, by his Human Nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Divine neither did, nor suffered any thing at all;
although in the doing of them, his Person be denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the Nature; so <hi>God purchased his Church with his
own Blood,</hi> Act. 20. 28.</p>
                  <p>4. IT may then be said, what did the Lord Christ in
this <hi>Condescention,</hi> with respect unto his Divine Nature?
The Apostle tells us, that he <hi>humbled himself, and made
himself of no reputation,</hi> Phil. 2. 7, 8. He vailed the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his Divine Nature in ours, and what he did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
so as that there was no outward Appearance or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
of it. The World hereon was so far from
looking on him as the <hi>true God,</hi> that it believed him not
to be a <hi>good Man.</hi> Hence they could never bear the least
intimation of his Divine Nature, supposing themselves
secured from any such thing, because they looked on him
with their Eyes to be a <hi>Man,</hi> as he was indeed, no less
truly and really than any one of themselves. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
on that Testimony given of himself, <hi>Before Abraham
was, I am,</hi> which asserts a Pre-existence from Eternity in
another Nature than what they saw, they were filled
with Rage, and <hi>took up stones to cast at him, John</hi> 8. 58.
And they give a Reason of their Madness, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 33.
Namely, that <hi>he being a Man, should make himself to be God.</hi>
This was such a thing, they thought, as could never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Heart of a wise and sober Man, namely, that
being so, owning himself to be such, he should yet say
of himself, that he was <hi>God:</hi> This is that which no <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
can comprehend, which nothing in Nature can parallel
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58587:37"/>
or illustrate, that one and the same Person should be both
God and Man: and this is the Principal Plea of the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
at this Day, who through the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> succeed
unto the <hi>Jews</hi> in an Opposition unto the Divine Nature of
Christ.</p>
                  <p>BUT all this difficulty is solved by the <hi>Glory of Christ
in this Condescention;</hi> for although in himself, or his own
Divine Person, he was <hi>over all God blessed for over,</hi> yet he
<hi>humbled himself for the Salvation</hi> of the Church unto the
Eternal Glory of God, to take our Nature upon him, and
to be made Man: and those who cannot see a Divine
Glory in his so doing, do neither know him, nor love
him, nor believe in him, nor do any way belong unto
him.</p>
                  <p>SO is it with the Men of these Abominations. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot behold the <hi>Glory</hi> hereof, they deny the
Foundation of our Religion, namely, the Divine Person
of Christ. Seeing he would be made <hi>Man,</hi> he shall be
esteemed by them <hi>no more</hi> than a Man. So do they reject
that Glory of God, his Infinite Wisdom, Goodness and
Grace, wherein he is more concerned than in the whole
Creation. And they dig up the Root of all Evangelical
Truths, which are nothing but Branches from it.</p>
                  <p>IT is true, and must be confessed, that herein it is
that our Lord Jesus Christ is a <hi>stumbing Stone, and a Rock
of Offence</hi> unto the World. It we should confess him <hi>only
as a Prophet, a Man sent by God,</hi> there would not be
much Contest about him, nor Opposition unto him. The
<hi>Mahumetans</hi> do all acknowledge it, and the <hi>Jews</hi> would
not long deny it; for their Hatred against him was, and
is solely because he professed himself to be God, and as
such was believed o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in the World. And at this day
partly through the Insinuation of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and partly
from the Efficacy of their own Blindness and Unbelief,
Multitudes are willing to grant him to be a Prophet sent
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58587:38"/>
of God, who do not, who will not, who cannot believe
the Mystery of this <hi>Condescention</hi> in the Susception of our
Nature, nor see the Glory of it. But take this away,
and all our Religion is taken away with it. Farewel
Christianity as unto the Mystery, the Glory, the Truth,
the Efficacy of it; let a refined <hi>Heathenism</hi> be established
in its Room. But this is the <hi>Rock</hi> on which the Church is
built, against which the Gates of Hell shall not prevail.</p>
                  <p>4. THIS <hi>Condescention</hi> of Christ was not by a <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasm</hi>
or an Appearance only. One of the first Heresies
that pestered the Church immediately after the Days of
the Apostles, was this, that all that was done or suffered
by Christ as a Man, were not the Acts, Doings or Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of one that was truly and really a Man, but an
outward Representation of things, like the <hi>Appearance of
Angels</hi> in the <hi>Shape of Men,</hi> eating and drinking under the
Old Testament; and suitably hereunto some in our Days
have spoken; namely, that there was only an Appearance
of Christ in the Man <hi>Jesus</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> in whom he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
no more than in other Believers. But the ancient
Christians told those Men the Truth; namely, that <hi>as
they had feigned unto themselves an imaginary Christ, so they
should have an imaginary Salvation only.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT the true Nature of this Divine Condescention
doth consist in these three Things.</p>
                  <p>1. THAT the <hi>Eternal Person of the Son of God, or the
Divine Nature in the Person of the Son of God, did by an inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable
Act of his Divine Power and Love, assume our Nature
into an individual Subsistence, in or with himself; that is,
to be his own, even as the Divine Nature is his.</hi> This is the
infallible Foundation of Faith even to them who can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
very little of these Divine Mysteries. They can
and do believe that the Son of God did take our Nature to
be his <hi>own,</hi> so as that whatever was done therein, was
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58587:38"/>
done by him, as it is with every other Man. Every Man
hath human Nature appropriated unto himself by an <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
Subsistence;</hi> whereby he becomes to be <hi>that man which
he is, and not another;</hi> or that Nature which is common
unto all, becomes in him to be peculiarly his <hi>own,</hi> as
if there were none Partaker of it but himself. <hi>Adam</hi> in
his first Creation, when all human Nature was in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
was no more that individual Man which he was,
than every Man is now the Man that he is, by his <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
Subsistence.</hi> So the Lord Christ taking that Nature
which is common unto all, into a peculiar Subsistence in
his own Person, it becometh his, and He <hi>the man Christ
Jesus.</hi> This was the <hi>Mind that was in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. BY reason of this <hi>Assumption of our Nature,</hi> with his
doing and suffering therein, whereby he was <hi>found in
fashion as a Man,</hi> the Glory of his Divine Person was vail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and he <hi>made himself of no reputation.</hi> This also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
unto his <hi>Condescention,</hi> as the first general Effect and
Fruit of it. But we have spoken of it before.</p>
                  <p>3. IT is also to be observed, That in the <hi>Assumption of
our Nature to be his own,</hi> He did not change it into a
thing Divine and Spiritual; but preserved it entire in all
its Essential Properties and Actings. Hence it really
did and suffered, was tried, tempted and forsaken as the
same Nature in any other Man might do and be. That
Nature as it was peculiarly his, and therefore he or his
Person therein, was exposed unto all the temporary E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
which the same Nature is subject unto in any other
Person.</p>
                  <p>THIS is a short general View of this <hi>incomprehensible
Condescention</hi> of the Son of God, as it is described by the
Apostle, <hi>Pil.</hi> 2. 5, 6, 7, 8. And this is that wherein in an
especial manner we are to <hi>behold the Glory of Christ by Faith</hi>
whilst we are in this World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:58587:39"/>
BUT had we the Tongue of Men and Angles, we
were not able in just measure to express the Glory of
this Condescention. For it is the most ineffable Effect
of the <hi>Divine Wisdom</hi> of the Father and of the <hi>Love of
the Son,</hi> the highest Evidence of the <hi>Care of God</hi>
towards Mankind. What can be equal unto it?
What can be like it? It is the Glory of Christian
Religion, and the <hi>animating Soul</hi> of all Evangelical
Truth. This carryeth the <hi>Mystery of the Wisdom of
God,</hi> above the Reason or Understanding of Men and
Angels to be the Object of Faith and Admiration only. A
Mystery it is that becomes the Greatness of God with his
Infinite Distance form the whole Creation; which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it unbecoming him that all his Ways and Works
should be comprehensible by any of his Creatures, <hi>Job</hi> 11.
4, 5, 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 34, 35, 36.</p>
                  <p>HE who was eternally in the Form of God, that is,
was essentially so, God by Nature, equally participant of
the same <hi>Divine Nature</hi> with God the Father: God over
<hi>all blessed for ever;</hi> who humbleth himself to behold the
things that are in Heaven and Earth: he takes on him
the <hi>Nature of Man,</hi> takes it to be his own; whereby he was
no less <hi>truly</hi> a Man in <hi>time,</hi> than he was truly <hi>God</hi> from
<hi>Eternity:</hi> And to encrease the Wonder of this Mystery,
because it was necessary unto the end the designed, he so
<hi>humbled himself</hi> in this Assumption of our Nature, as to
make himself of <hi>no Reputation</hi> in this World; yea, unto
that Degree, that he said of himself, that he was a <hi>Worm
and no Man,</hi> in comparison of them who were of any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem.</p>
                  <p>WE <hi>speak</hi> of these things in a poor, low, broken
manner. We <hi>teach</hi> them as they are revealed in the
Scripture. We labour by Faith to adhere unto them as
revealed. But when we come into a steady, direct View
and Consideration of the <hi>thing it self,</hi> our Minds fail, our
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58587:39"/>
Hearts tremble, and we can find no rest, but in an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Admiration of what we cannot comprehend. Here
we are at a loss, and know that we shall be so whilst we
are in this World: But all the ineffable Fruits and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of this Truth are communicated unto them that do
believe.</p>
                  <p>IT is with reference hereunto, that that great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
concerning him is given unto the Church, <hi>Isa. 8.
14. He shall be for a Sanctuary</hi> (namely, unto all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
as it is expounded, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 8.) <hi>but for a stone of
stumbling, and a rock of offence,</hi> even to <hi>them that stumble at
the Word, being disobedient, whereunto also they were appointed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HE is herein a <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> an assured Refuge unto all
that betake themselves unto him. What is it that any
Man in distress, who flies thereunto may look for in a
<hi>Sanctuary?</hi> A Supply of all his Wants, a Deliverance from
all his Fears, a Defence against all his Dangers, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
unto him therein. Such is the Lord Christ herein
unto sin-distressed Souls; he is a Refuge unto us in all
spiritual Distresses and Disconsolations, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. See
the Exposition of the Place. Are we or any of us bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
with a Sense of Sin? Are we perplexed with Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations?
Are we bowed down under the Oppression of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Spiritual Adversary? Do we on any of these accounts
walk in Darkness and have no Light? One View of the
Glory of Christ herein is able to support us and relieve us.</p>
                  <p>UNTO whom we betake our selves for Relief in any
case, we have regard to nothing but their <hi>Will</hi> and their
<hi>Power.</hi> If they have both, we are sure of Relief. And
what shall we fear in the <hi>Will</hi> of Christ as unto this end?
What will he not do for us? He who thus <hi>emptied</hi> and
<hi>humbled</hi> himself, who so infinitely condescended from the
Prerogative of his Glory in his Being and Self-sufficiency,
in the Susception of our Nature for the Discharge of the
Office of a Mediator on our Behalf; will he not relieve
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58587:40"/>
us in all our Distresses? <hi>Will</hi> he not do all for us we stand
in need of, that we may be eternally saved? <hi>Will</hi> he not
be a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> unto us?</p>
                  <p>NOR have we hereon any Ground to fear his <hi>Power:</hi>
For by this infinite Condescention to be a suffering Man,
he lost nothing of his Power as <hi>God Omnipotent;</hi> nothing
of his Infinite Wisdom or glorious Grace. He could still
do, all that he could do as God from Eternity. If there
be any thing therefore in a Coalescency of <hi>Infinite Power,</hi>
with <hi>Infinite Condescention,</hi> to constitute a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tressed
Sinners, it is all in Christ Jesus. And if we see
him not glorious herein, it is because there is no <hi>Light of
Faith</hi> in us.</p>
                  <p>THIS <hi>then</hi> is the Rest wherewith we may cause the weary to
rest, and this is the Refreshment. Herein is he an hiding
place from the Wind, and a Covert from the Tempest, as Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of Water in a dry place, and as the shadow of a great Rock
in a weary Land. <hi>Hereon he says,</hi> I have satiated the weary
soul, and have refreshed every sorrowful soul. <hi>Under this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
it is, that in all Evangelical Promises and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations
for coming to him, he is proposed unto distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Sinners as their only</hi> Sanctuary.</p>
                  <p>HEREIN he is a <hi>stone of stumbling, and a rock of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi>
unto the unbelieving and disobedient, who <hi>stumble at
the Word.</hi> They cannot, they will not see the Glory of
this <hi>Condescention,</hi> they neither desire nor labour so to do;
yea, they hate it and despise it. Christ in it is a <hi>stone of
stumbling,</hi> and a <hi>rock of offence</hi> unto them. Wherefore
they chuse rather utterly to deny his Divine Person, than
allow that he did thus abase himself for our Sakes. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than they will own this Glory, they will allow him
no Glory. A Man they say he was, and no more, and
this was his Glory. This is that Principle of Darkness
and Unbelief, which works effectually at this day in the
Minds of many. They think it an absurd thing, as the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58587:40"/>
                     <hi>Jews</hi> did of old, that he being a man should be God also;
or on the other hand that the Son of God should thus
condescend to take our Nature on him. This they can
see no Glory in, no Relief, no Refuge, no Refreshment
unto their souls in any of their Distresses: Therefore do
they deny his Divine Person: Here Faith triumphs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inds that to be a <hi>Glorious Sanctuary,</hi> which
they cannot at all discern.</p>
                  <p>BUT it is not so much the Declaration or Vindication
of this Glory of Christ which I am at present engaged in
as an Exhortation unto the <hi>practical Contemplation</hi> of it in
a way of believing. And I know that among many
this is too much neglected; yea, of all the evils which I
have seen in the Days of my Pilgrimage now drawing
to their close, there is none so grievous as the Public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Principal Mysteries of the Gospel among
them that are called Christians. Religion in the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of some Men is withered in its vital Principles, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in its Nerves and Sinews, but thought to be put off
with outward Gaiety and Bravery.</p>
                  <p>BUT my Exhortation is unto diligence in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of this <hi>Glory of Christ,</hi> and the exercise of our
Thoughts about it. Unless we are diligent herein it is
impossible we should be <hi>steady</hi> in the principal <hi>Acts of Faith,</hi>
or <hi>ready</hi> unto the principal <hi>duties of Obedience.</hi> The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Act of Faith respects the <hi>Divine Person</hi> of Christ, as
all Christians must acknowledge. This we can never
secure (as hath been declared) if we see not his Glory in
this <hi>Condescention:</hi> And whoever reduceth his Notions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
experience, will find that herein his Faith stands or
falls. And the Principal Duty of our Obedience, is <hi>self-denial,</hi>
with <hi>readiness for the Cross.</hi> Hereunto the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of this Condescention of Christ is the Principal
Evangelical Motive, and that wherein to our Obedience
in it is to be resolved, as the Apostle declares, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58587:41"/>
5, 6, 7. And no Man doth <hi>deny himself</hi> in a due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
who doth it not on the Consideration of the <hi>self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial</hi>
of the Son of God. But a prevalent Motive this is
thereunto. For what are the things wherein we are to
deny our selves, or forgo what we pretend to have
a Right unto? It is in our Goods, our Liberties,
our Relations, our Lives. And what are they, any, or
all of them, in themselves, or unto us, considering our
Condition, and the end for which we were made? Perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things, which whether we will or no, within a few
days death will give us an everlasting separation from.
Things under the Power of a <hi>Feaver</hi> or an <hi>Asthma,</hi> &amp;c.
As unto our Interest in them. But how incomparable
with respect hereunto is that <hi>Condescention</hi> of Christ, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we have given an Account? If therefore we find an
unwillingness in us, a Tergiversation in our minds about
these things when called unto them in a way of Duty,
one view by Faith of the Glory of Christ in this Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scention,
and what he parted from therein, when he
made himself of no Reputation, will be an Effectual cure
of that sinful Distemper.</p>
                  <p>HEREIN then, I say, we may by <hi>Faith</hi> behold the
Glory of Christ, as we shall do it by <hi>Sight</hi> hereafter. If
we <hi>see no Glory in it,</hi> if we discern not that which is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Eternal Admiration, we walk in darkness. It is
the most ineffable Effect of Divine Wisdom and Grace.
Where are our Hearts and Minds, if we can see no Glory
in it? I know in the Contemplation of it, it will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
overwhelm our <hi>Reason,</hi> and bring our Understanding
into a loss: But unto this <hi>loss</hi> do I desire to be brought
every day: For when Faith can no more act it self
in <hi>Comprehension,</hi> when it finds the Object it is fixed on,
too great and glorious to be brought into our Minds
and Capacities, it will issue (as we said before) in holy
<hi>Admiration,</hi> humble <hi>Adoration,</hi> and joyful <hi>Thanksgiving.</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:58587:41"/>
In and by its actings in them, doth it fill the soul with
<hi>Joy unspeakable and full of Glory.</hi>

               <head type="sub">The Glory of Christ in his Love.</head>
               <p>IN the Susception and Discharge of the <hi>Mediatory Office
by the</hi> Son of God, the Scripture doth most eminently
represent his <hi>Love,</hi> as the sole impelling and leading cause
thereof, Gal. 2. 20. 1 Joh. 3. 16. Rev. 1. 5.</p>
               <p>HEREIN is he <hi>glorious,</hi> in a way and manner incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible:
For in the Glory of <hi>Divine Love,</hi> the chief
<hi>Brightness of Glory</hi> doth consist. There is nothing of Dread
or Terror accompanying it, nothing but what is <hi>amiable</hi>
and infinitely refreshing. Now that we may take a view
of the Glory of Christ herein by Faith, the <hi>Nature</hi> of it
must be enquired into.</p>
               <p>1. THE <hi>Eternal Disposing Cause</hi> of the whole work
wherein the Lord Christ was engaged by the Susception
of this Office, for the Redemption and Salvation of the
Church, is the <hi>Love of the Father.</hi> Hereunto it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
ascribed in the Scripture. And this <hi>Love of the
Father</hi> acted it self in his Eternal Decrees, before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the world, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. and afterwards in the
sending of his Son to render it effectual, Joh. 3. 16. <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally,</hi>
it is his Eternal Election of a Portion of mankind
to be brought unto the enjoyment of himself, through the
Mystery of the Blood of Christ, and the Sanctification of
the Spirit, 2 <hi>Thes. 2. 13, 16. 1 Ephes. 1. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
1 Pet.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:58587:42"/>
THIS <hi>Eternal Act</hi> of the Will of God the Father, doth
not <hi>contain</hi> in it an actual approbation of, and complacency
in the state and condition of those that are elected; but
only <hi>designeth</hi> that for them on the Account whereof,
they shall be accepted and approved. And it is called his
<hi>Love</hi> on sundry Accounts.</p>
               <p>1. BECAUSE it is an act suited unto that glorious
Excellency of his Nature, wherein he is Love; for <hi>God
is Love,</hi> 1 John 4. 8, 9. And the first Egress of the
Divine Properties must therefore be in an act of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative
Love. And whereas this Election being an
Eternal Act of the Will of God, can have no <hi>moving cause</hi>
but what is in himself, if we could look into all the
Treasures of the Divine Excellencies, we should find
none whereunto it could be so properly ascribed, as unto
<hi>Love.</hi> Wherefore,</p>
               <p>2. IT is stiled <hi>Love,</hi> because it was <hi>free</hi> and undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
as unto any thing on our part. For whatever good
is done unto any altogether undeserved, if it be with a
design of their Profit and Advantage, it is in an <hi>Act of
Love,</hi> and can have no other cause. So is it with us in
respect of Eternal Election. There was nothing in us,
nothing foreseen, as that which <hi>from our selves</hi> would be in
us, that should any way move the Will of God unto this
Election: For whatever is good in the best of men is
an effect of it, Ephes. 1. 4. Whereas therefore it tends
unto our eternal Good, the spring of it must be <hi>Love.</hi>
And,</p>
               <p>3. THE <hi>Fruits or Effects</hi> of it are inconceivable Acts
of Love. It is by multiplied Acts of Love, that it is
made effectual, <hi>John 3. 16. Jerem. 31. 5. Eph. 1. 3, 4,
5, 6. 1 John</hi> 4. 8, 9, 16.</p>
               <p>THIS is the Eternal Spring which is derived unto the
Church, through the Mediation of Christ. Wherefore
that which put all the Design of this Eternal Love of the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58587:42"/>
Father into Execution, and wrought out the Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it, was <hi>the Love of the Son,</hi> which we enquire
after; and Light may be given unto it in the ensuing
Observations.</p>
               <p>1. THE whole Number or Society of the Elect, were
Creatures made in the Image of God, and thereby in a
State of <hi>Love</hi> with him. All that they were, had, or
hoped for, were effects of Divine Goodness and Love.
And the Life <hi>of their</hi> Souls was <hi>Love unto God.</hi> And a
blessed State it was, preparatory for the Eternal <hi>Life of
Love</hi> in Heaven.</p>
               <p>2. FROM this State they <hi>fell by sin,</hi> into a state of
<hi>Enmity</hi> with God; which is comprehensive of all Miseries,
Temporal and Eternal.</p>
               <p>3. NOTWITHSTANDING this woful <hi>Catastrophe</hi>
of our first state, yet our Nature on many Accounts was
recoverable unto the Enjoyment of God, as I have at
large elsewhere declared.</p>
               <p>4. IN this Condition, the first <hi>Act of Love</hi> in Christ
towards us, was in <hi>Pity</hi> and <hi>Compassion.</hi> A Creature made
in the Image of God, and fallen into Misery, yet capable
of Recovery, is the proper Object of <hi>Divine Compassion.</hi>
That which is so celebrated in the Scripture, as the
<hi>Bowels,</hi> the <hi>Pity,</hi> the <hi>Compassion of God,</hi> is the acting of
Divine Love towards us, on the consideration of our
Distress and Misery. But all Compassion ceaseth towards
them whose condition is irrecoverable. Wherefore the
Lord Christ pitied <hi>not the Angels</hi> that fell, because their
Nature was not to be relieved. Of this <hi>Compassion</hi> in Christ,
see <hi>Heb. 2. 14, 15, 16. Isa.</hi> 63. 9.</p>
               <p>5. AS then we lay under the Eye of Christ in our
<hi>Misery,</hi> we were the Objects of his <hi>Pity</hi> and <hi>Compassion:</hi>
But as he looketh on us as <hi>recoverahle</hi> out of that state, his
<hi>Love</hi> worketh in and by <hi>Delight.</hi> It was an inconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Delight</hi> unto him to take a prospect of the deliverance
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58587:43"/>
of mankind unto the Glory of God, which is also an act
of Love, see this divinely expressed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 30, 31;
as that place hath been elsewhere explained.</p>
               <p>6. IF it be enquired, whence this <hi>compassion</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi>
in him should arise, what should be the cause of
them; that he who was eternally blessed in his own self-sufficiency
should so deeply concern himself in our lost for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn
Condition? I say it did so, merely from the <hi>Infinite
Love</hi> and Goodness of his own Nature, without the least
procuring inducement from us, or any thing in us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
3. 16.</p>
               <p>7. IN this his Readiness, Willingness and Delight,
springing from Love and Compassion, the <hi>council</hi> of God
concerning the way of our Recovery, is, as it were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
unto him. Now this was a <hi>way</hi> of great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and perplexities unto himself; that is, unto his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
as it was to be constituted. Unto the Divine Nature
nothing is grievous, nothing is difficult: But he was to
have <hi>another</hi> Nature, wherein he was to undergo the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
of this way and work. It was required of him,
that he should <hi>pity us</hi> until he had none left to pity himself
when he stood in need of it; that he should pursue his
<hi>delight</hi> to save us, until his own <hi>soul was heavy</hi> and sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
unto death; that he should relieve us in our <hi>sufferings</hi>
by <hi>suffering</hi> the same things that we should have done.
But he was not in the least hereby deterred from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
this work of Love and Mercy for us: Yea his
love rose on this Proposal, like the Waters of a mighty
Stream against opposition. For hereon he says, <hi>Lo, I
come to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o thy will, O God,</hi> it is my <hi>delight</hi> to do it, <hi>Heb.</hi>
10. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>8. BEING thus enclined, disposed, and ready in the
Eternal Love of his Divine Person, to undertake the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Mediation, and the work of our Redemption; A
body <hi>was prepared for</hi> him. In this Body or Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58587:43"/>
made his <hi>own,</hi> he was to make this Love effectual in
all its Inclinations and Actings. It was provided for him
unto this end, and filled with all Grace in a way <hi>unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable,</hi>
especially with <hi>Fervent Love</hi> unto Mankind. And
hereby it became a meet Instrument to actuate his Eternal
Love in all the fruits of it.</p>
               <p>9. IT is hence evident, that this <hi>Glorious Love of
Christ,</hi> doth not consist alone in the <hi>Eternal Actings of his
divine Person,</hi> or the Divine Nature in his Person, such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is the <hi>Love of the Father</hi> namely, his Eternal Purpose
for the communication of Grace and Glory, with his
Acquiescency therein; but there is more in the Love of
Christ. For when he exercised this Love, he was man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
and not God only. And in none of those Eternal Acts
of Love could the Human Nature of Christ have any
interest or concern; yet is the Love of the Man Christ
Jesus, celebrated in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>10. WHEREFORE this Love of Christ which we
enquire after, is the <hi>Love of his Person;</hi> that is, which
he in his own Person acts in and by his Distinct Natures
according unto their Distinct Essential Properties. And
the acts of love in these distinct Natures, are infinitely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
and different; yet are they all acts of <hi>one</hi> and the
<hi>same Person.</hi> So then, whether that Act of Love in Christ
which we would at any time consider, be an Eternal
Act of the <hi>Divine</hi> Nature in the Person of the Son of
God; or whether it be an act of the <hi>Human</hi> performed
in time by the Gracious Faculties and Powers of that
Nature, it is still the <hi>Love of one and the self same Person,
Christ Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was an Act of inexpressible Love in him that he <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
our Nature, Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 17. But it was an act in
and of his Divine Nature only: For it was antecedent
unto the existence of his Human Nature, which could
not therefore concur therein. His <hi>laying down his life</hi> for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58587:44"/>
us, was an act of inconceivable Love, 1 <hi>John</hi> 8. 16. Yet
was it only an act of the Human <hi>Nature</hi> wherein he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
himself and died. But both the one and the other
were Acts of his <hi>Divine Person;</hi> whence it is said that God
laid down his life for us, and purchased the Church with
his own Blood.</p>
               <p>THIS is that Love of Christ wherein he is glorious, and
wherein we are by Faith to behold his Glory. A great
part of the Blessedness of the Saints in Heaven, and their
Triumph therein, consists in their <hi>beholding of this Glory
of</hi> Christ, in their thankful contemplation of the Fruits
of it, see <hi>Rev. 5. 9, 10. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE illustrious <hi>Brightness</hi> wherewith this Glory shines
in Heaven, the All satisfying <hi>Sweetness</hi> which the view
of it gives unto the Souls of the Saints there Possessed of
Glory, are not by us conceivable nor to be expressed. Here
this love <hi>passeth knowledge,</hi> there we shall comprehend the
Dimensions of it. Yet even here, if we are not slothful
and carnal, we may have a refreshing prospect of it;
and where Comprehension fail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, let Admiration take
place.</p>
               <p>MY present Business is to exhort others unto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of it, though it be but a little, a very little,
a small portion of it, that I can conceive; and less than
that very little, that I can express. Yet may it be my
duty to excite not only my self, but others also unto due
Enquiries after it, unto which End I offer the things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>LABOVR that your minds may continually be fitted and
prepared for s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch Heavenly Contemplations.</hi> If they are carnal
and sensual, or filled with earthly things, a due sense of this
<hi>Love of Christ</hi> and its Glory, will not abide in them. Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Vice in their highest Degrees are not more <hi>dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically</hi>
opposite and inconsistent in the same mind, than
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58587:44"/>
are an habitual Course of sensual worldly Thoughts, and
a due Contemplation of the Glory of the Love of Christ:
Yea, an earnestness <hi>of Spirit,</hi> pregnant with a multitude
of Thoughts about the lawful Occasions of Life, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
of all due Communion with the Lord Jesus
Christ herein.</p>
               <p>FEW there are whose Minds are <hi>prepared</hi> in a due
Manner for this Duty. The Actions and Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the most, evidence what is the inward Frame of
their Souls. They rove up and down in their Thoughts,
which are continually lead by their Affections into the
Corners of the Earth. It is in vain to call such Persons
unto Contemplations of the Glory of Christ in his Love.
An holy Composure of Mind by virtue of spiritual prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
an Inclination to seek after Refreshment in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Things, and to bath the Soul in the Fountain of
them, with constant Apprehensions of the Excellency of
this Divine Glory, are required hereunto.</p>
               <p>2. BE not satisfied with <hi>General Notions</hi> concerning
the Love of Christ, which represent no Glory unto the
Mind, wherewith many deceive themselves. All who
believe his divine Person, profess a Valuation of his Love,
and think them <hi>not Christians</hi> who are otherwise minded:
But they have only <hi>General Notions,</hi> and not any distinct
Conceptions of it, and really know not what it is. To
deliver us from this Snare, peculiar Meditations on its
principal Concerns, are required of us. As,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>WHOSE Love it is;</hi> namely, of the divine Person
of the Son of God. He is expresly called <hi>God,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto the Exercise of this Love; that we may always
consider whose it is, 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 16. Hereby we perceive the
Love of God, because he laid down his Life for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. BY what <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> this wonderful <hi>Love</hi> of
the Son of God, doth act it self; namely, in the divine
Nature, by Eternal Acts of Wisdom, Goodness and Grace
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58587:45"/>
proper thereunto; and in the humane by Temporary
Acts of Pity or Compassion, with all the Fruits of them in
doing and suffering for us, see <hi>Ephes. 3. 19. Heb. 2. 14,
15. Rev.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
               <p>3. WHAT is the <hi>Freedom</hi> of it as unto any desert on
our Part, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 10. It was Hatred not Love that we
in our selves deserved, which is a Consideration suited to
fill the Soul with self-abasement, the best of Frames in the
contemplation of the Glory of Christ.</p>
               <p>4. WHAT is the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of it in its Fruits and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
with sundry other Considerations of the like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
By a distinct Prospect and Admiration of these
Things, the Soul may walk in this Paradise of God, and
gather here and there an Heavenly Flower, conveying
unto it a sweet Savour of this Love of Christ. See <hi>Cant.</hi>
11. 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>MOREOVER, Be not contented to have <hi>right Notions</hi>
of the Love of Christ in your Minds, unless you can attain
a gracious <hi>Taste</hi> of it in your Hearts; no more than you
would be to see a Feast or Banquet richly prepared, and
partake of nothing of it unto your Refreshment. It is of
that Nature that we may have a <hi>spiritual Censation</hi> of it in
our Minds; whence it is compared by the Spouse to <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Flagons of Wine.</hi> We may <hi>taste</hi> that the Lord is
gracious. And if we find not a Relish of it in our Hearts,
we shall not long retain the Notion of it in our Minds.
Christ is the Meat, the Bread, the Food of our Souls.
Nothing is in him of an higher spiritual Nourishment than
his Love, which we should always desire.</p>
               <p>IN this Love is he <hi>Glorious;</hi> for it is such as no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Angels, or Men could have the least Conceptions
of, before its Manifestation by its Effects: And after its
Manifestation, it is in this World absolutely incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Glory of Christ in the Discharge of his
Mediatory Office.</head>
               <p>AS the Lord Christ was <hi>Glorious</hi> in the <hi>Susception</hi> of his
Office: So was he also in its Discharge. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
Glory accompanied him in all that he did, in all that
he suffered. <hi>Vnseen</hi> it was unto the Eyes of the World,
but not in his who alone can judge of it. Had Men seen
it, they would not have <hi>crucified the Lord of Glory.</hi> Yet to
some of them it was made manifest. Hence they testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that in the Discharge of his Office, they <hi>beheld his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,</hi> Joh. 1. 14.
And that when others could see neither <hi>Form nor Comliness
in him that he should be desired,</hi> Psal. 53. 2. and so it is at
this day. I shall only make some few Observations; first,
on what he did in a <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Obedience,</hi> and then on what
he <hi>suffered</hi> in the Discharge of his Office so undertaken by
him.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>WHAT he did,</hi> what Obedience he yielded unto the
Law of God, in the Discharge of his Office (with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
whereunto he said, <hi>Lo, I come to do thy Will, O God,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ea, thy Law is in my Heart</hi>) it was all <hi>on his own free choice</hi>
or Election, and was resolved thereinto alone. It is our Duty
to endeavor after <hi>Freedom, Willingness,</hi> and Chearfulness in
all our Obedience. Obedience hath its formal Nature from
our <hi>Wills.</hi> So much as there is of our <hi>Wills,</hi> in what
we do towards God, so much there is of Obedience, and
no more. Howbeit, we are <hi>antecedently</hi> unto all Acts of
our own Wills obliged unto all that is called Obedience.
From the very Constitution of our Natures, we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58587:46"/>
subject unto the Law of God. All that is left
unto us, is a voluntary <hi>Compliance</hi> with unavoidable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
with him it was not so. An Act of his own
Will and Choice <hi>preceded</hi> all Obligation as unto Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
He <hi>obeyed because he would,</hi> before <hi>because he ought.</hi>
He said, <hi>Lo, I come to do thy Will, O God,</hi> before he was
obliged to do that Will. By his own Choice, and that
in an Act of Infinite Condescention and Love, as we have
shewed, he was <hi>made of a woman,</hi> and thereby <hi>made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law.</hi> In his Divine Person he was Lord of the
Law, above it, no more obnoxious unto its Commands,
than its Curse. Neither was he afterwards in himself on
his own Account unobnoxious unto its Curse, merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was <hi>Innocent,</hi> but also because he was every way
above the Law it self, and all its force.</p>
               <p>This was the Original Glory of his Obedience. The
Wisdom, the Grace, the Love, the Condescention that
was in this <hi>Choice,</hi> animated every Act, every Duty of
his Obedience rendring it amiable in the sight of God,
and useful unto us. So when he went unto <hi>John</hi> to be
baptized, he who knew he had no need of it on his own
Account, would have declined the Duty of administring
that Ordinance unto him; but he replied, <hi>Suffer it to be so
now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness,</hi> Mat. 3.
15. This I have undertaken <hi>willingly</hi> of my own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
without any need of it for my self, and therefore will
discharge it. For him who was <hi>Lord</hi> of all universally,
thus to submit himself to Universal Obedience, carrieth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with it an Evidence of Glorious Grace.</p>
               <p>2. THIS Obedience as unto the <hi>use and end</hi> of it, was
not for himself, but <hi>for us.</hi> We were obliged unto it,
and could not perform it; he was not obliged unto it any
otherwise but by a free Act of his own Will, and did
perform it. God gave him this Honour, that he should
obey for the whole Church, that by <hi>his obedience we should
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58587:46"/>
be made righteous,</hi> Rom. 5. 19. Herein I say did God
give him Honour and Glory, that his Obedience should
stand in the stead of the perfect Obedience of the Church
as unto Justification.</p>
               <p>3. HIS Obedience being absolutely <hi>universal,</hi> and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
<hi>perfect,</hi> was the great Representative of the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God in the Law. It was repre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nted glorious
when the <hi>Ten Words</hi> were written by the Finger of God
in Tables of Stone: It appears yet more eminently in the
Spiritual Transcription of it in the Hearts of Believers:
But absolutely and perfectly it is exemplified only in the
Holiness and Obedience of Christ, which answered it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the utmost. And this is no small Part of his Glory in
Obedience, that the Holiness of God in the Law was
therein, and therein alone in that one Instance, as unto
human Nature, fully represented.</p>
               <p>4. HE wrought out this Obedience against all <hi>Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Oppressions.</hi> For although he was absolutely free
from that Disorder which in us hath invaded our whole
Natures, which internally renders all Obedience difficult
unto us, and perfect Obedience impossible; yet as unto
Opposition from without in <hi>Temptations, Sufferings, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,</hi>
Contradictions, he met with more than we all.
Hence is that glorious Word, <hi>Although he were a Son, yet
he learned Obedience by the things which be suffered,</hi> Heb. 5.
8. See our Exposition of that place. But,</p>
               <p>5. THE Glory of this Obedience ariseth principally
from the Consideration of the <hi>Person,</hi> who thus yielded it
unto God. This was no other but the Son of God
made Man; God and Man in one Person. He who
was in Heaven, above all, Lord of all, at the same
time lived in the World in a Condition of no Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a Course of the strictest Obedience unto the whole
Law of God. He unto whom Prayer was made, prayed
himself Night and Day. He whom all the Angels of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58587:47"/>
Heaven, and all Creatures worshiped, was continually
conversant in all the Duties of the Worship of God. He
who was over the House, diligently observed the meanest
Office of the House. He that made all Men, in whose
Hand they are all as Clay in the Hand of the Potter, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
amongst them the strictest Rules of <hi>Justice,</hi> in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto every one his Due, and of <hi>Charity,</hi> in giving
good things that were not so due. This is that which
renders the Obedience of Christ in the Discharge of his
Office, both mysterious and glorious.</p>
               <p>2. AGAIN, The Glory of Christ is proposed unto us
in what he suffered in the Discharg of the Office which
he had undertaken. There belonged indeed unto his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
Victory, Success, and Triumph with great Glory,
<hi>Isa. 63. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</hi> but there were <hi>Sufferings</hi> also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of him antecedently thereunto. <hi>Ought not Christ to
suffer, and to enter into his Glory?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT such were these <hi>Sufferings of Christ,</hi> as that in
our Thoughts about them, our Minds quickly recoil
in a Sense of their Insufficiency to conceive a Right of
them: Never any one launched into this Ocean with his
Meditations, but he quickly found himself unable to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom
the Depths of it: Nor shall I here undertake an
Enquiry into them. I shall only point at this Spring of
Glory, and leave it under a Vail.</p>
               <p>WE might here look on him as under the <hi>Weight</hi> of
the Wrath of God, and the Curse of the Law; taking
on himself, and on his whole Soul, the utmost of Evil
that God had ever threatned to Sin or Sinners; we might
look on him in his <hi>Agony</hi> and bloody Sweat, in his strong
Cries and Supplications, when he was sorrowful unto the
Death, and <hi>began to be amazed,</hi> in apprehensions of the
things that were coming on him; of that dreadful <hi>Tryal</hi>
which he was entring into: we might look upon him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
with all the <hi>Powers of Darkness,</hi> the Rage and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58587:47"/>
of Men; suffering in his Soul, his Body, his Name,
his Reputation, his Goods, his Life; some of these Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
being immediate from God above, oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs from
Devils and wicked Men, acting according to the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
Counsel of God: we might look on him <hi>praying,
weeping, crying</hi> out, bleeding, dying, in all things mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Soul an Offering for sin: So was he taken from
Prison, and Judgment, and who shall declare his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?
for he was cut off from the Land of the Living,
<hi>For the Transgression</hi> (saith God) <hi>of my People was he smitten,
Isa. 53. 8.</hi> But these things I shall not insist on in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
but leave them under such a Vail as may give us
a Prospect into them, so far as to fill our Souls with holy
Admiration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>LORD!</hi> What is Man that thou art thus mindful of
him, and the Son of Man that thou visitest him? Who
hath known thy Mind, or who hath been thy Councellor?
O the depth of the Riches both of the Wisdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of God! How unsearchable are his Judgments, and
his Ways past finding out? What shall we say unto these
things? that God spared not his only Son, but gave him
up unto Death, and all the Evils included therein, for
such poor lost Sinners as we were; that for our Sakes the
Eternal Son of God should submit himself unto all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
that our Natures are obnoxious unto, and that our
Sins had deserved, that we might be delivered!</p>
               <p>HOW <hi>Glorious</hi> is the Lord Christ on this Account in
the Eyes of Believers! When <hi>Adam</hi> had sinned, and
thereby eternally, according unto the Sanction of the Law,
ruined himself and all his Posterity, he stood ashamed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
trembling, as one ready to perish for ever under the
Displeasure of God. <hi>Death</hi> was that which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
and <hi>immediate Death</hi> was that which he looked for.
In this State the Lord Christ in the Promise comes unto
him, and says, <hi>Poor Creature!</hi> How woful is thy Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58587:48"/>
How <hi>deformed</hi> is thy Appearance! What is become
of the Beauty, of the Glory of that <hi>Image</hi> of God where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thou wast created? How hast thou taken on thee the
monstrous Shape and Image of Satan! And yet thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Misery, thy Entrance into Dust and Darkness, is no
way to be compared with what is to ensue. Eternal <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress</hi>
lies at the Door. But yet look up once more, and
<hi>behold me,</hi> that thou mayest have some Glymps of what
is in the Designs of Infinite Wisdom, Love and Grace.
Come forth from thy vain <hi>Shelter,</hi> thy hiding Place: I
will put my self into thy Condition. I will undergo and
bear that Burthen of Guilt and Punishment, which would
sink thee eternally into the bottom of Hell. I will <hi>pay
that which I never took;</hi> and be made <hi>temporally</hi> a Curse for
thee, that thou mayest attain unto <hi>Eternal</hi> Blessedness. To
the same purpose he speaks unto convinced Sinners in the
Invitation he gives them to come unto him.</p>
               <p>THUS is the Lord Christ set forth in the <hi>Gospel evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
crucified before our Eyes,</hi> Gal. 3. 1. Namely, in the
Representation that is made of his Glory, in the <hi>Suffering</hi>
he underwent for the Discharge of the Office he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken.
Let us then behold him as poor, despised,
persecuted, reproached, reviled, <hi>hanged on a Tree;</hi> in all
labouring under a Sense of the <hi>Wrath of God</hi> due unto our
Sins. Unto this End are they recorded in the Gospel,
read, preached, and represented unto us. But what can
we see herein? What Glory is in these things? Are not
these the things which all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

stumbled and took Offence at? Those wherein he was
appointed to be a <hi>Stone of stumbling,</hi> and a <hi>Rock of offence?</hi>
Was it not esteemed <hi>a foolish thing</hi> to look for Help and
Deliverance by the Miseries of another? To look for
Life by his Death? The Apostle declares at large that
such it was esteemed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. So was it in the Wisdom
of the World. But even on the Account of these things

<hi>would you did reign, that we might reign with you.</hi> But
the Members of the mystical Body must be <hi>conformed</hi> unto
the Head. In him, Sufferings went before Glory; and
so they must in them. The Order in the Kingdom of
Satan and the Word, is contrary hereunto. First, the
<hi>Good Things</hi> of this Life, and then <hi>Eternal Misery,</hi> is the
Method of that Kingdom, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 25.</p>
               <p>THESE are the two Springs of the Salvation of the
Church; the two <hi>anointed ones</hi> that stand before the Lord
of the whole Earth; from which all the <hi>golden Oyl</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Church is dedicated unto God and sanctified doth
flow. This Glory of Christ in his <hi>Exaltation</hi> which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
on his Sufferings, is that which we now enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
And we shall state our Apprehensions of it in the
ensuing Observations.</p>
               <p>1. THIS is peculiarly <hi>that Glory</hi> which the Lord
Christ prays that his Disciples may be where he is, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
it. It is not solely so, as it is considered absolutely:
but it is that, wherein all the other Parts of his Glory
are made manifest. It is the Evidence, the Pledge, the
Means of the Manifestation of them all. As unto all
the Instances of his Glory before insisted on, there was a
Vail drawn over them whilst he was in this World.
Hence the most saw <hi>nothing</hi> of it, and the best saw it but
<hi>obscurely.</hi> But in this Glory that Vail is taken off, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the whole Glory of his Person in it self, and in the
Work of Mediation is most illustriously manifested.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58587:49"/>
When we shall immediately behold this Glory, we shall
see him as he is. This is that Glory whereof the Father
<hi>made grant</hi> unto him before the Foundation of the World,
and wherewith he was actually invested upon his Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>2.
BY this Glory of Christ, I do not understand the
<hi>Essential Glory</hi> of his Divine Nature; or his being abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
in his own Person over all <hi>God blessed for ever:</hi> But
the manifestation of this Glory in particular, after it had
been <hi>vailed</hi> in this World under the <hi>Form of a Servant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs</hi>
hereunto. The Divine Glory of Christ in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
belongs not unto his Exaltation; but the Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it doth so. It was not given him by <hi>free Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
but the Declaration of it unto the Church of Angels
and Men after his Humiliation was so. He left it not
whilst he was in this World; but the direct Evidence
and Declaration of it he <hi>laid aside,</hi> until he was <hi>declared
to be the Son of God with Power,</hi> by the Resurrection from
the Dead.</p>
               <p>WHEN the Sun is under a total Eclipse, he loseth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his Native, Beauty, Light, and Glory. He is
still the same that he was from the beginning; a <hi>great
Light to rule the Day.</hi> To us he appears as a dark useless
<hi>Meteor:</hi> but when he comes by his course to free himself
from the <hi>Lunar Interposition</hi> unto his proper Aspect towards
us, he manifests again his Native Light and Glory. So
was it with the Divine Nature of Christ as we have before
declared. He <hi>vailed</hi> the <hi>Glory</hi> of it by the Interposition of
the Flesh, or the Assumption of our Nature to be his
<hi>own,</hi> with this Addition, that therein he took on him the
<hi>Form of a Servant,</hi> of a Person of mean and low Degree.
But this temporary <hi>Eclipse</hi> being past and over, it now
shines forth in its Infinite Lustre and Beauty, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
unto the present <hi>Exaltation</hi> of his Person. And
when those who behel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> him here as a poor, sorrowful,
persecuted Man, dying on the Cross<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:58587:50"/>
in all the infinite increated Glories of the Divine Nature,
manifesting themselves in his Person, it could not but fill
their Souls with Transcendent Joy and Admiration. And
this is one reason of his <hi>Prayer</hi> for them whilst he was on
the Earth, that they <hi>might be where he is to behold his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
For he knew what ineffable Satisfaction it would be
unto them for evermore.</p>
               <p>3. I do not understand absolutely the <hi>Glorification of
the Human Nature of Christ;</hi> That very Soul and Body
wherein he lived and died, suffered and rose again, tho
that also be included herein. This also were a Subject
meet for our Contemplation, especially as it is the <hi>Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar</hi>
of that Glory which he will bring all those unto,
who believe in him. But because at present we look
somewhat further, I shall observe only one or two things
concerning it.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>THAT very Nature it self</hi> which he took on him in
this World, is exalted into Glory. Some under a Pretence
of great Subtilty and Acuracy do deny that he hath either
Flesh or Blood in Heaven, that is, as to the Substance
of them; however you may suppose that they are chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
purified, glorified. The great Foundation of the
Church, and all Gospel Faith is, that he was <hi>made Flesh,</hi>
that he did partake of Flesh and Blood, even as did the
Children. That he hath forsaken that <hi>Flesh and Blood</hi>
which he was <hi>made</hi> in the Womb of the Blessed Virgin;
wherein he lived and died, which he offered unto God in
Sacrifice, and wherein he rose from the Dead, is a <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Fiction. What is the true Nature of the Glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Humanity</hi> of Christ, neither those who thus
surmise, nor we can perfectly comprehend. It doth not
yet appear what we our selves shall be, much less is it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
unto us what he is, whom we shall be like. But
that he is still in the same <hi>Human Nature,</hi> wherein he was
on the earth, that he hath the same rational Soul, and the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58587:50"/>
same Body, is a fundamental Article of the Christian
Faith.</p>
               <p>2. THIS Nature of the Man Christ Jesus, is <hi>filled
with all the Divine Graces and Perfections</hi> whereof a limited
created Nature is capable. It is not <hi>Deified,</hi> it is not
made a God; it doth not in Heaven coalesce into one
Nature with the Divine by a Composition of them; It
hath not any Essential Property of the Deity communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto it, so as subjectively to reside in it; It is not
made <hi>Omniscient, Omnipresent, Omnipotent:</hi> But it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
in a Fulness of all Divine Perfection ineffably above
the Glory of Angels and Men. It is incomprehensibly
nearer God than they all; hath Communications from
God, in glorious Light, Love, and Power, ineffably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
them all. But it is still a Creature.</p>
               <p>FOR the <hi>Substance</hi> of this Glory of the Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Christ, Believers shall be made Partakers of it;
for when we <hi>see him as he is,</hi> we shall <hi>be like him:</hi> but as
unto the Degrees and Measures of it, his Glory is above
all that we can be made Partakers of: There is one <hi>Glory
of the Sun, another of the Moon and Stars, and one Star dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
from another in Glory,</hi> As the Apostle speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
15. 45. And if there be a difference in Glory among
the <hi>Stars</hi> themselves as to some degrees of the same Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
How much more is there between the Glory of the
<hi>Sun,</hi> and that of any <hi>Star</hi> whatever? Such is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
that is and will be unto Eternity between the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Nature of Christ, and what glorified Believers do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
unto. But yet this is not that properly wherein the
Glory of Christ in his <hi>Exaltation</hi> after his humiliation
and Death, doth consist. The Things that belong unto
it may be reduced unto the ensuing Heads.</p>
               <p>1. IT consisteth in the <hi>Exaltation</hi> of the Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as subsisting in the Divine Person above the whole
Creation of God in Power, Dignity, Authority and Rule,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:58587:51"/>
with all things that the Wisdom of God hath appointed
to render the Glory of it illustrious. I have so largely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on the Explication and Confirmation of this Part of
the present Glory of Christ, in the Exposition of <hi>Heb.
1. ver.</hi> 2, 3. that I have nothing more to add there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>2. IT doth so in the <hi>Evidence given</hi> of the Infinite <hi>Love
of God the Father unto him,</hi> and his delight in him, with
the Eternal Approbation of his Discharge of the Office
committed unto him. Hence he is said <hi>to sit at the right
hand of God,</hi> or at the <hi>right hand of the Majesty on high.</hi>
That the Glory and Dignity of Christ in his Exaltation
is <hi>singular,</hi> the highest that can be given to a Creature
incomprehensible; that he is with respect unto the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of his Office, under the eternal Approbation of
God; that as so gloriously exalted, he is proclaimed unto
the whole Creation, are all contained in this Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p>3. HEREUNTO is added the full <hi>Manifestation</hi> of his
own Divine Wisdom, Love and Grace in the Work of
Mediation and Redemption of the Church. This Glory
is absolutely singular and peculiar unto him. Neither
<hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>Men</hi> have the least Interest in it. Here we see
it darkly as in a Glass; above, it shines forth in its bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the eternal Joy of them who behold him.</p>
               <p>THIS is that Glory which our Lord Jesus Christ in an
especial manner <hi>prayed</hi> that his Disciples might behold.
This is that whereof we ought to endeavor a Prospect by
<hi>Faith.</hi> By <hi>Faith,</hi> I say, and not by <hi>Imagination.</hi> Vain
and foolish Men having general Notions of this <hi>Glory of
Christ,</hi> knowing nothing of the real Nature of it, have
endeavored to represent it in <hi>Pictures</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> with all
that Lustre and Beauty with the Art of Painting, with
the Ornaments of Gold and Jewels, can give them. This
is that Representation of the present Glory of Christ, which
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58587:51"/>
being made and proposed unto the Imagination and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Affections of superstitious Persons carrieth such a shew
of Devotion and Veneration in the <hi>Papal</hi> Church. But
they err not knowing the Scripture, nor the eternal Glory
of the Son of God.</p>
               <p>THIS is the sole Foundation of all our Meditations
herein. The Glory that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the
real actual Possession of in Heaven, can be no otherwise
seen or apprehended in this World, but in the <hi>Light of
Faith,</hi> fixing it self on Divine Revelation. To behold
this Glory of Christ is not an Act of <hi>Fancy</hi> or Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It doth not consist in <hi>framing</hi> unto our selves the
Shape of a glorious Person in Heaven. But the steady
Exercise of Faith on the <hi>Revelation</hi> and <hi>Description</hi> made
of his Glory of Christ in the Scripture, is the Ground,
Rule and Measure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of all Divine Meditations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>HEREON
our Duty it is, <hi>to call our selves to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</hi>
as unto our Endeavor after a gracious View of this
Glory of Christ: When did we stedfastly behold it?
When had we such a View of it as wherein our Souls
have been satisfied and refreshed? It is declared and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
unto us as one of the chief Props of our Faith,
as an Help of our Joy, as an Object of our Hope, as a
Ground of our Consolation, as our greatest Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto Obedience and Suffering. Are our Minds e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day conversant with Thoughts hereof? Or do we
think our selves not much concerned herein? Do we look
upon it, as that which is without us and above us, as that
which we shall have time enough to consider when we
come to Heaven? So is it with many. They care nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>where</hi> Christ is, nor <hi>what</hi> he is, so that one way or
other they may be saved by him. They hope, as they
pretend, that they shall see him and his Glory in Heaven,
and that they suppose to be time enough: But in vain do
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58587:52"/>
they pretend a Desire thereof; in vain are their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of any such thing. They who endeavor not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Glory of Christ in this World, as hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
said, shall never behold him in glory hereafter unto
their Satisfaction; nor do they desire so to do. Only
they suppose it a part of that <hi>Relief</hi> which they would
have when they are gone out of this World. For what
should beget such a Desire in them? Nothing can do it,
but some View of it here by Faith, which they despise,
or totally neglect. Every Pretence of a <hi>Desire of Heaven,</hi>
and of the Presence of Christ therein, that doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
from, that is not resolved into that Prospect which
we have of the Glory of Christ in this World by Faith, is
mere <hi>Fancy</hi> and Imagination.</p>
               <p>OUR constant Exercise in <hi>Meditation</hi> on this Glory of
Christ will fill us with <hi>Joy</hi> on his Account, which is an
effectual Motive unto the Duty it self. We are for the
most part <hi>Selfish,</hi> and look no farther than our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments.
So we may be pardoned and saved by him,
we care not much how it is with himself, but only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
it is well enough. We find not any Concernment
of our own therein. But this Frame is directly opposite
unto the <hi>Genius</hi> of Divine Faith and Love. For their
principal Actings consist in preferring Christ above our
selves; and our Concerns in him, above all our own.
Let this then stir us up unto the Contemplation of this
Glory. Who is it that is thus exalted over all? Who is
thus encompassed with Glory, Majesty, and Power? Who
is it that sits down at the Right Hand of the Majesty on
high, all his Enemies being made his Foot-stool? Is it not
he, who in this World was poor, despised, persecuted
and slain, all for our Sakes? Is it not the same <hi>Jesus</hi> who
loved us, and gave himself for us, and washed us in his
own Blood? So the Apostle told the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the <hi>same
Jesus whom they slew and hanged on a Tree, God had exalted
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58587:52"/>
with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour to give Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
unto Israel, and the forgiveness of sins,</hi> Act. 5. 30, 31.
If we have any valuation of his Love, if we have any
concernment in what he hath done and suffered for the
Church, we cannot but rejoyce in his present State and
Glory.</p>
               <p>LET the World rage whilest it pleaseth; let it set
it self with all its Power and Craft against every thing of
Christ that is in it; which whatever is by some otherwise
pretended, proceeds from an hatred unto his Person: Let
Men make themselves drunk with the blood of his Saints,
we have this to oppose unto all their attempts, unto our
supportment, Namely, what he says of himself; <hi>Fear not,
I am the first and the last, he that liveth and was dead, and
behold I am alive</hi> for <hi>evermore, and have the Keys of Hell and
Death,</hi> Rev. 1. 16, 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BLESSED Jesus!</hi> We can add nothing to thee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to thy Glory; but it is <hi>a Joy of heart unto us that
thou art what thou art;</hi> that thou art so gloriously exalted
at the right hand of God; and do long more fully and
clearly to behold that Glory according to thy Prayer and
Promise.</p>

Moses and all the Prophets, he declared unto his Disciples
in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself,</hi> Luk. 24.
27. It is therefore manifest that <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:58587:53"/>
and all the Scriptures, do give Testimony unto him, and
his Glory. This is the line of Life and Light, which
runs through the whole Old Testament; without the
conduct whereof we can understand nothing aright<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
And the neglect hereof, is that which makes many
as blind in reading the Books of it, as are the <hi>Jews,</hi> the
same vail being upon their minds. It is <hi>Faith</hi> alone, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the Glory of Christ, that can remove that <hi>vail</hi>
of darkness which covers the minds of men in reading
the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> as the Apostle declares, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 14,
15, 16. I shall therefore consider briefly some of those
ways and means whereby the glory of Christ was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
unto Believers under the Old Testament.</p>
               <p>1. IT was so in the Institution of the <hi>Beautiful Worship</hi>
of <hi>the Law,</hi> with all the means of it. Herein have they
the Advantage above all the splendid <hi>Ceremonies</hi> that men
can invent, in the outward worship of God; they were
designed and framed in Divine Wisdom to represent the
Glory of Christ in his Person and his Office. This no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Human Invention can do, or once pretend unto.
Men cannot create <hi>Mysteries,</hi> nor give unto any thing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
in it self, a <hi>Mystical</hi> signification. But so it was
in the Old Divine Institutions. What were the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
and Temple? What was the <hi>Holy Place</hi> with the
Utensils of it? What was the Oracle, the Ark, the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims,
the Mercy-Seat placed therein? What was the
High-Priest in all his Vestments and Administrations?
What were the Sacrifices, and annual sprinkling of Blood
in the most Holy Place? What was the most whole <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme</hi>
of their Religious Worship? Were there any thing
but Representations of Christ in the Glory of his Person
and his Office? They were a <hi>Shadow,</hi> and the Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by that shadow, was Christ. If any would
see how the Lord Christ was in particular foresignified
and represented in them, he may peruse our <hi>Exposition on
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58587:53"/>
the ninth Chapter of the Epistle unto the Hebrews,</hi> where it
is handled so at large as that I shall not here again insist
upon it. The Sum is, <hi>Moses was faithful in all the House
of God, for a Testimony of those things which mere to be spoken
afterwards,</hi> Heb. 3. 5. All that <hi>Moses</hi> did in the erection
of the Tabernacle, and the institution of all its services,
was but to give an <hi>antecedent Testimony</hi> by way of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation,
unto the Things of Christ that were <hi>aftewards</hi>
to be revealed. And that also was the substance of the
Ministry of the <hi>Prophets, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 11, 12. The dark
apprehensions of the Glory of Christ which by these
means they obtained, were the life of the Church of
Old.</p>
               <p>2. IT was represented in the <hi>Mystical Account</hi> which is
given us of his Communion with his Church in Love
and Grace. As this is intimated in many places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
so there is one <hi>entire Book</hi> designed unto its Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This is the <hi>Divine Song of Solomon</hi> who was a Type
of Christ, and a Penman of the Holy Ghost therein. A
Gracious Record it is of the Divine Communications of
Christ in Love and Grace unto his Church, with their
returns of love unto him, and delight in him. And then
may a man judge himself to have somewhat profited in
the experience of the Mystery of a blessed entercourse
and communion with Christ, when the expressions of
them in that holy <hi>Dialogue,</hi> do give Light and Life unto
his mind, and efficaciously communicate unto him an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of their power. But because these things are
little understood by many, the <hi>book</hi> it self is much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
if not despised. Yea to such impudence have some
arrived, in foaming out their own shame, as that they
have ridiculed the expressions of it; but we are foretold
of such <hi>mockers</hi> in the last days, that should <hi>walk</hi> after <hi>their
own ungodly lusts;</hi> they are not of our present considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:58587:54"/>
THE former Instance of the Representations of the
Glory of Christ in their Institutions of <hi>outward Worship</hi>
with this Record of the <hi>inward communion</hi> they had with
Christ in Grace, Faith, and Love, gives us the Substance of
that view which they had of his Glory. What holy strains
of Delight and Admiration, what Raptures of Joy, what
solemn and divine Complacency, what ardency of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Diligence in Attendance unto the means of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
communion with him, this discovery of the
Glory of Christ wrought in the souls of them that did
believe, is <hi>Emphatically</hi> expressed in that discourse. A few
days, a few hours spent in the frame characterised in it,
is a Blessedness excelling all the treasures of the Earth;
and if we, whose Revelations of the same Glory do far
exceed theirs, should be found to come short of them in
Ardency of Affection unto Christ, and continual holy Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of his excellencies, we shall one day be judged
unworthy to have received them.</p>
               <p>3. IT was so represented and made known under the
Old Testament in his <hi>personal Appearances</hi> on various occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
unto several Eminent Persons, Leaders of the
Church in their Generations. This he did as a <hi>Praelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
to his Incarnation. He was as yet God only; but
appeared in the assumed shape of a <hi>man,</hi> to signifie what
he would be. He did not <hi>create an Human Nature,</hi> and
unite it unto himself for such a Season; only by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Power he acted the Shape of a Man composed of
what <hi>Aetherial Substance</hi> he pleased, immediately to be
dissolved. So he appeared to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Jacob,</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi>
to <hi>Joshua,</hi> and others, as I have at large elsewhere proved
and confirmed. And hereon also, because he was the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Person who dwelt in, and dealt with the Church,
under the Old Testament from first to last, in so doing
he constantly assumes unto himself <hi>Human Affections,</hi> to
intimate that a season would come when he would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58587:54"/>
act in that Nature. And indeed after the fall
there is nothing spoken of God in the Old Testament,
nothing of his Institutions, nothing of the way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of dealing with the Church, but what hath respect
unto the <hi>future Incarnation</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> And it had been
absurd to bring in God under perpetual <hi>Anthropopathis,</hi> as
grieving, repenting, being angry, well-pleased, and the
like, were it not but that the Divine Person intended,
was to take on him the Nature wherein such Affections
do dwell.</p>
               <p>4. IT was represented in <hi>Prophetical Visions.</hi> So the
Apostle affirms that the Vision which <hi>Isaiah</hi> had of him,
was when <hi>he saw his Glory,</hi> John, 12. 41. And it was a
blessed Representation thereof. For his Divine Person
being exalted on a <hi>Throne of Glory,</hi> his <hi>Train</hi> filled the
Temple. The <hi>whole Train</hi> of his Glorious Grace filled
the Temple of his body. This is the <hi>true Tabernacle</hi> which
God pitched, and not man. The <hi>Temple</hi> which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd
and which he raised again in three days, wherein
dwelt the fulness of the Godhead. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 9. This Glory
was now presented unto the view of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> Chap. 6. 1,
2, 3. which filled him with Dread and Astonishment.
But from thence he was relieved, by an act of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of that <hi>Glorious</hi> one, taking away his Iniquity by a <hi>coal
from the Altar,</hi> which typified the purifying efficacy of his
Sacrifice. This was food for the Souls of Believers, in
these and on the like occasions, did the whole Church
lift up their voice in that Holy Cry, <hi>Make hast our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
and be thou like to a Roe, or to a young Hart on the
Mountain of Spices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OF the same Nature was his Glorious Appearance on
Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> at the giving of the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. For the
description thereof by the <hi>Psalmist, Psal.</hi> 68. 17, 18. is
applyed by the Apostle unto the <hi>Ascension of Christ</hi> after
his Resurrection, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 8, 9, 10, 11. Only as it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58587:55"/>
was then full of outward Terror, because of the giving of
the <hi>fiery Law,</hi> it was referred unto by the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> as full
of Mercy, with respect unto his Accomplishment of the
same Law. His <hi>giving</hi> of it was as Death unto them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
because of its Holiness, and the severity of the
the Curse wherewith it was attended; his <hi>fulfilling</hi> of it
was <hi>Life,</hi> by the Pardon and Righteousness which issued
from thence.</p>
               <p>5. THE Doctrine of his <hi>Incarnation</hi> whereby he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the Subject of all that Glory which we enquire after,
was revealed, although not so clearly as by the Gospel,
after the actual accomplishment of the thing it self. In
how many places this is done in the Old Testament, I
have elsewhere declared; at least I have explained and
vindicated many of them (for no man can presume to
know them all) <hi>Vindic. Evangel.</hi> One instance therefore shall
here suffice, and this is that of the same Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi>
chap. 9. v. 6, 7. <hi>Vnto us a child is born, unto us a Son is
given, and the government shall be on his shoulder, and his
name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, the
everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace, of the encrease of his
government and peace there shall be no end, upon the Throne of</hi>
David <hi>and upon his Kingdom to order it and establish it with
judgment and Justice from henceforth and for ever, the zeal
of the Lord of Hosts will perform this.</hi> This one Testimony
is sufficient to confound all <hi>Jews, Socinians,</hi> and other Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Glory of Christ. I do acknowledge, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notwithstanding
this Declaration of the Glory of Christ
in his future Incarnation and Rule there remained much
darkness in the minds of them unto whom it was then
made. For although they might and did acquiesce in
the truth of the Revelation, yet they could frame to
themselves no notions of the way or manner of its accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment.
But now when every word of it is explained,
declared, and its Mystical Sence visibly laid open unto us
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58587:55"/>
in the Gospel, and by the accomplishment exactly answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every expression in it, it is Judicial Blindness not to
receive it. Nothing but the <hi>Satanical Pride</hi> of the hearts
of men which will admit of no effects of Infinite Wisdom,
but what they suppose they can comprehend, can shut
their eyes against the Light of this Truth.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>PROMISES, Prophesies, Praedictions,</hi> concerning his
Person, his coming, his Office, his Kingdom and his Glory
in them all, with the Wisdom, Grace and Love of God
to the Church in him, are the Line of Life, as was said,
which runs through all the Writings of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and take up a great portion of them. Those
were the things which he expounded unto his Disciples
out of <hi>Moses and all the Prophets.</hi> Concerning these things
he appealed to the <hi>Scriptures</hi> against all his adversaries;
<hi>Search the Scriptures, for they are they that testifie of me.</hi> And
if we find them not, if we discern them not therein, it is
because a vail of Blindness is over our minds. Nor can
we read, study, or meditate on the Writings of the Old
Testament unto any Advantage, unless we design to find
out and behold the Glory of Christ declared and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in them. For want hereof they are a <hi>sealed book</hi>
to many unto this day.</p>
               <p>7. IT is usual in the Old Testament to set out the Glory
of Christ under <hi>Metaphorical Expressions;</hi> yea it aboundeth
therein. For such <hi>Allusions</hi> are exceedingly suited to let
in a sense into our minds of those things which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
distinctly comprehend. And there is an Infinite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention
of Divine Wisdom in their way of Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Representing unto us the Power of Things Spiritual,
in what we naturally discern. Instances of this kind in
calling the Lord Christ by the Names of those Creatures
which unto our senses represent that Excellency which is
spiritually in him, are innumerable. So he is called the
<hi>Rose</hi> for the sweet savour of his Love, Grace and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58587:56"/>
the <hi>Lilly</hi> for his gracious Beauty and Amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
the <hi>Pearl</hi> of Price for his worth, for to them that
believe he is precious; the <hi>Vine</hi> for his fruitfulness; the
<hi>Lion</hi> for his Power, The <hi>Lamb</hi> for his Meekness and Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for Sacrifice, with other things of the like kind al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
innumerable.</p>
               <p>THESE Things have I mentioned, not with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to search into the depth of this Treasury of those
Divine Truths concerning the Glory of Christ; but only
to give a little Light unto the words of the <hi>Evangelist,</hi>
that he <hi>opened unto his disciples out of Moses and all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
the things which concerned himself;</hi> and to stir up our
own souls unto a contemplation of them as contained
therein.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
               <head type="sub">The Glory of Christ in his intimate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the Church.</head>
               <p>VVHAT concerns the Glory of Christ in the <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Holy Ghost</hi> unto the Church, with
all the Divine truths that are branched from it,
I have at large declared in my Discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>whole dispensation of the Holy Spirit.</hi> Here
therefore it must have no place amongst those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other things which offer themselves unto our contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
as part of this Glory, or intimately belonging
thereunto. I shall insist briefly on <hi>Three</hi> only, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be reduced directly unto the former heads.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:58587:56"/>
AND the first of these is, <hi>That intimate Conjunction that
is between Christ and the Church;</hi> whence it is just and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
in the sight of God, according unto the Rules of his
Eternal Righteousness, that what he did and suffered in the
Discharge of his Office, should be esteemed, reckoned, and
imputed unto us, as unto all the fruits and benefits of it,
as if we had done and suffered the same things our selves.
For this <hi>conjunction</hi> of his with us, was an act of his own
Mind and Will, wherein he is ineffably glorious.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Enemies</hi> of the glory of Christ and of his Cross,
do take this for granted, That there ought to be such a
<hi>conjunction</hi> between the <hi>guilty person</hi> and him that <hi>suffers</hi> for
him, as that in him the guilty person may be said in
some sense to undergo the punishment himself. But then
they affirm on the other hand, That there was <hi>no such
conjunction</hi> between Christ and sinners, none at all; but
that he was a <hi>man,</hi> as they were men; and otherwise,
that he was at the greatest distance from them all, as it is
possible for one man to be from another, <hi>Socin. de Servat.
lib. 3. cap. 3.</hi> The falseness of this latter Assertion, and
the gross ignorance of the Scripture under a pretence of
<hi>subtilty,</hi> in them that make it, will evidently appear in our
ensuing Discourse.</p>
               <p>THE Apostle tells us 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. That <hi>in his own
self he bare our sins in his own body on the tree;</hi> and chap. 3.
18. That <hi>he suffered for sin, the just for the unjust, that he
might bring us unto God.</hi> But this seems somewhat strange
unto Reason; where is the Justice, where is the Equity,
that the just should suffer for the unjust? Where is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Righteousness herein? For it was an act of God, <hi>The
Lord hath laid on him the iniquites of us all,</hi> Isa. 53. 6. The
Equity hereof, with the grounds of it, must be here a
little enquired into.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:58587:57"/>
FIRST of all, it is certain that all the Elect, the
whole Church of God, fell in <hi>Adam,</hi> under the curse due
to the transgression of the Law. It is so also, that in
this curse, <hi>Death</hi> both <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Eternal</hi> was contained.
This curse none could undergo and be saved. Nor was
it consistent with the Righteousness, or Holiness, or Truth
of God, that sin should go unpunished. Wherefore
there was a necessity upon a supposition of Gods Decree
to save his Church, of a <hi>Translation of punishment;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
from them who had <hi>deserved</hi> it, and could not bear it,
unto one who had <hi>not</hi> deserved it, but <hi>could bear</hi> it.</p>
               <p>A SUPPOSITION of this <hi>Translation of punishment</hi> by
Divine dispensation, is the foundation of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
yea of all supernatural Revelation contained in the
Scripture. This was first intimated in the <hi>first promise;</hi>
and afterwards explained and confirmed in all the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Old Testament. For although in the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of the Law there was a revival of the greatest and
most fundamental principal of the Law of Nature, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That <hi>God is to be worshipped with our best;</hi> yet the
principal end and use of them, was to represent this <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
of punishment</hi> from the offender unto another, who
was to be a Sacrifice in his stead.</p>
               <p>THE reasons of the equity hereof, and the unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
glory of Christ herein, is what we now enquire into.
And I shall reduce what ought to be spoken hereunto, to
the ensuing Heads.</p>
               <p>1. IT is not <hi>contrary</hi> unto the nature of Divine Justice;
it doth not interfere with the principles of natural light in
man, that in sundry cases <hi>some persons should suffer punishment
for the fine and offences of others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I SHALL at present give this Assertion no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
but only that God hath often done so, who
will, who can do no iniquity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:58587:57"/>
SO he affirms that he will do, Exod. 20. 5. <hi>Visiting
the sins of the fathers upon the children under the third and
fourth generation.</hi> It is no exception of weight, that they
also are sinners, continuing in their Fathers sins: for the worst
of sinners must not be dealt unjustly withal; but they
must be so if they are punished for their fathers sins, and
it be absolutely unlawful that any one should be punished
for the sin of another.</p>
               <p>SO the Church affirms; <hi>Our fathers have sinned, and
are not; and we have born their iniquities,</hi> Lam. 5. 11.
And so it was: For in the <hi>Babylonish</hi> captivity God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
the sins of their fore-fathers, especially those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in the days of <hi>Manasses,</hi> 2 King. 23. 26, 27. As
afterwards in the final destruction of that Church and
Nation, God punished in them the guilt of all <hi>bloody per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions</hi>
from the beginning of the world, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.
50, 51.</p>
               <p>SO <hi>Canaan</hi> was cursed for the sin of his Father, <hi>Gen. 9.
25. Saul</hi>'s seven Sons were put to death for their Fathers
bloody Cruelty, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 8. 14. For the Sin of <hi>David,</hi>
seventy thousand of the People were destroyed by an
Angel, concerning whom he said, <hi>It is I that have sinned
and done evil, these sheep what have they done? 2 Sam. 24.
15, 17.</hi> See also 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 29. So was it with all the
Children or Infants that perished in the Flood, or in the
Conflagration of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> And other instances
of the like nature may be assigned.</p>
               <p>IT is therefore evident, That there is <hi>no inconsistency
with the nature of Divine Justice,</hi> nor the Rules of Reason
among Men, that in sundry Cases the Sins of some may
be punished on others.</p>
               <p>2. IT is to be observed that this Administration of
Justice is not promiscuous, that any whatever, may be
punished for the sins of any others. There is always a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58587:58"/>
special Cause and Reason of it; and this is a <hi>peculiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi>
between them who sin, and those who are punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for their sins. And two Things belong unto this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.
(1.) Especial <hi>Relation.</hi> (2.) Especial <hi>mutual Interest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. THERE is an especial <hi>Relation</hi> required unto this
<hi>Translation of Punishment.</hi> Such as that between Parents
and Children, as in most of the Instances before given;
or between a King and Subjects, as in the Case of <hi>David.</hi>
Hereby the Persons sinning, and those suffering, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
<hi>one Body,</hi> wherein if one Member offend, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
may justly suffer: The back may answer for what
the hands takes away.</p>
               <p>2. IT consists in <hi>mutual Interest.</hi> Those whose sins
are punished in others, have such an <hi>Interest</hi> in them, as
that their being so, is a punishment unto themselves.
Therefore are such sinners threatned with the punishment
and evils that shall befall their Posterity or Children for
their sakes which is highly poepal unto themselves, Numb.
14. 33. <hi>Your Children shall wander in the wilderness forty
years, and bear your whoredoms.</hi> The Punishment due to
their sins is in part transferred unto their Children, and
therein did the sting of their own Punishment also consist.</p>
               <p>3. THERE is a greater, a more <hi>Intimate Conjunction,</hi>
a nearer Relation, an higher mutual Interest <hi>between Christ
and the Church,</hi> than ever was or can be between any other
Persons or Relations in the world, whereon it became
just and equal in the sight of God, that he should suffer
for us, and that what he did and suffered should be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
unto us, which is farther to be cleared.</p>
               <p>THERE neither is nor can be any more than a Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Conjunction between diverse, distinct Persons. The
first is <hi>Natural,</hi> the second is <hi>Moral,</hi> whereunto I refer
that which is <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Mystical;</hi> and the Third <hi>Foederal,</hi>
by vertue of mutual compact. In all these ways is Christ
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58587:58"/>
in <hi>Conjunction</hi> with his Church, and in every in one of
them, in a way <hi>Singular</hi> and Peculiar.</p>
               <p>1. THE first Conjunction of distinct Persons is <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</hi>
God hath made all Mankind <hi>of one blood, Act.</hi> 17.
26. Whereby there is a Cognation and Alliance between
them all. Hence every Man, is every Mans Brother or
Neighbour, unto whom loving kindness is to be shewed,
<hi>Luk. 10. 36.</hi> And this Conjunction was between Christ
and the Church; as the Apostle declares, Heb. 2. 14.
<hi>Forasmuch as the Children are partakers of flesh and blood, he
also himself likewise took part of the same, that through death
he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the
Devil, and deliver them who through fear of death were all
their life time subject to bondage.</hi> Hence both <hi>he that sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
and they who are sanctified are all of one,</hi> v. 11. His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Condescention in coming into this Communion and
Conjunction of Nature with us, was before declared:
But it is not common like that between all other Men
partakers of the same Nature. There are <hi>Two Things</hi>
wherein it was peculiar and eminent.</p>
               <p>1. THIS <hi>Conjunction</hi> between him and the Church,
did not arise from a <hi>necessity of Nature,</hi> but from a <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi>
act of his Will. The Conjunction that is between
all others is necessary. Every Man is every Mans Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
whether he will or no, by being a Man. Natural
Generation communicating to every one his subsistence in
the same Nature, prevents all acts of their own Will and
Choice. With the Lord Christ it was otherwise as the
Text affirms: For such Reasons as are there expressed, he
did by an act of his own Will <hi>partake of Flesh and Blood,</hi>
or came into this Conjunction with us. He did it of his
own choice, <hi>because the Children did partake of the same.</hi>
He <hi>would</hi> be what the Children where. Wherefore the
<hi>Conjunction</hi> of Christ in humane Nature with the Church,
<hi>is ineffably</hi> distinct from that common Conjunction which
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58587:59"/>
is amongst all others in the same Nature. And therefore
altho it should not be meet amongst meer Men, that one
should act and suffer in the stead of others, because they
are all thus related to one another as it were whether they
will or no; yet this could not reach the Lord Christ, who
in a strange and wonderful manner came into this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
by a meer act of his own.</p>
               <p>2. HE came into it on this design, and for this only
end, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mely, that <hi>in our Nature taken to be his own,</hi> he
might do and suffer what was to be done and suffered for
the Church: So it is added in the Text; <hi>That by death he
might destroy him who had the power of death;</hi> and <hi>deliver
them who for fear of death were subject to Bondage.</hi> This
was the only end of his Conjunction in Nature with the
Church: And this puts the case between him and it, at a
vast distance from what is or may be between other Men.</p>
               <p>IT is a foolish thing to argue, that because a <hi>mere
participation of the same Nature</hi> among Men, is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to warrant the Righteousness of punishing one for
another; that therefore the conjunction in the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
betwixt Christ and the Church, is not a sufficient and
just foundation of his suffering for us, and in our Stead!
For by <hi>an act of his own will and choice,</hi> he did partake of
of our Nature, and that for this very end, that therein
he might suffer for us, as the Holy Ghost expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares.
Amongst <hi>others</hi> there neither is nor can be any
thing of this Nature, and so no objection from what is
equal or inequal amongst them, can arise against what
is equal between Christ and the Church. And herein is
he glorious and precious unto them that believe, as we
shall see immediately.</p>
               <p>2. THERE is a <hi>Mystical Conjunction</hi> between Christ
and the Church, which answers all the most strict <hi>real or
moral Vnions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Conjunctions</hi> between other persons or
things. Such is the Conjunction between the head of a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58587:59"/>
body and its members, or the tree of the vine and its
branches which are <hi>real;</hi> or between an Husband and
Wife, which is <hi>moral</hi> and real also. That there is such a
Conjunction between Christ and his Church, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
plentifully declares, as also that it is the Foundation
of the Equity of his suffering in its stead. So speaks the
Apostle, Eph. 5. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
love your Wives, even as Christ also loved the Church</hi>
(that is his Wife, the Bride the Lambs Wife) <hi>and gave
himself for it.</hi> &amp;c. Being the Head and Husband of the
Church, which was to be sanctified and saved, and could
be so no otherwise but by his Blood and Sufferings, he
was both meet so to suffer, and it was righteous also that
what he did and suffered should be imputed unto them
for whom he both did it, and suffered. Let the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
of the Glory of Christ assign any one Instance of
<hi>such a Conjunction,</hi> Union and Relation between any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
mankind, as is between Christ and the Church,
and they may give some countenance unto their Cavils
against his Obedience and Sufferings in our stead, with
the imputation of what he did and suffered unto us. But
the Glory of Christ is <hi>singular</hi> herein, and as such it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
unto them by whom the Mystery of it is in any
measure spiritually apprehended.</p>
               <p>BUT yet it will be said, that this <hi>Mystical Conjunction</hi>
of Christ with his Church is <hi>consequential</hi> unto what he
did and suffered for it: for it ensues on the conversion
of Men unto him. For it is by Faith that we are implanted
into him. Until that be actually wrought in us, we have
no <hi>Mystical Conjunction</hi> with him. He is not an <hi>Head,</hi> or
an <hi>Huusband</hi> unto unregenerate, unsanctified unbelievers
whilst they continue so to be: And such was the state of
the whole Church when Christ suffered for us, <hi>Rom. 5. 8.
Eph. 2. 5.</hi> There was therefore no such <hi>Mystical Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
between him and the Church, as to render it meet and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58587:60"/>
equal that he should suffer in its stead. Wherefore
the Church is the <hi>Effect of the Work of the Redemption,</hi> that
wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch rose out of it, which was made and constituted by
it; and cannot be so the <hi>Object</hi> of it, as that which was
to be redeemed by vertue of an antecedent Conjunction
with it. I answer,</p>
               <p>1. ALTHOUGH this <hi>Mystical Conjunction</hi> is not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
consummate without an actual Participation of the
Spirit of Christ, yet the Church of the Elect was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
antecedently unto all his sufferings, to be his Spouse
and Wife, so as that he might love her and suffer for
her; so it is said, <hi>Hos. 12. 13. Israel served for a wife, and
for a wife he kept sheep.</hi> Howbeit, she was not his <hi>married
wife,</hi> until after he had served for her, and thereby pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
her to be his Wife; yet as he served for her, she
is called his <hi>Wife,</hi> because of his <hi>Love</hi> unto her, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the was so designed to be upon his Service. So was
the Church designed to be the Spouse of Christ in the
Counsel of God, whereon he loved her, and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for her.</p>
               <p>HENCE in the work of Redemption the Church was
the <hi>Object</hi> of it as designed to be the Spouse of Christ,
and the <hi>Effect</hi> of it, inasmuch as that thereby it was
made meet for the full consummation of that Alliance;
as the Apostle expresly declares, <hi>Eph. 5. 25, 26, 27.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. ANTECEDENTLY unto all that the Lord Christ
did and suffered for the Church, there was a supreme
act of the Will of God the Father, <hi>giving all the Elect
unto him,</hi> entrusting them with him, to be redeemed,
sanctified and saved; as himself declares, Joh. 17. 6, 9.
Chap. 10. 14, 15, 16. And on these Grounds this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Conjunction between Christ and the Church hath
its vertue and efficacy before it be actually consummate.</p>
               <p>3. THERE is a <hi>foederal Conjunction</hi> between distinct
Persons: And as this is various according unto the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58587:60"/>
of the Interests and Ends of them that enter into it;
so that is most eminent, where one by the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of all that are concerned, undertakes to be a <hi>Sponsor</hi>
or <hi>Surety</hi> for others, to do and answer what on their part is
required of them for attaining the ends of the Covenant.
So did the Lord Christ undertake to be <hi>Surety</hi> of the new
Covenant in behalf of the Church, <hi>Heb. 7. 22.</hi> and
thereon tendred himself unto God to do and suffer for
them, in their stead, and on their behalf, whatever was
required, that they might be sanctified and saved. These
things I have treated of at large elsewhere, as containing
a great part of the Mystery of the Wisdom of God in
the Salvation of the Church. Here therefore I do only
observe that this is that whereby the <hi>Mystical Conjunction</hi>
that was between Christ and the Church, whereon it was
<hi>meet just</hi> and <hi>equal</hi> in the sight of God, that what he did
and suffered should be imputed unto us, is compleated.</p>
               <p>THESE are some of the Foundations of that <hi>Mystery
of transmitting the sins of the Church</hi> as unto the guilt and
punishment of them from the sinners themselves unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
every way innocent pure and righteous in himself,
which is the Life, Soul and Center of all Scripture Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations.
And herein is he exceedingly <hi>Glorious,</hi> and
precious unto them that believe. No heart can conceive,
no Tongue can express the Glory of Christ herein. Now
because his Infinite Condescension and Love herein have
been spoken to before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I shall here only instance its
Greatness in some of its Effects.</p>
               <p>1. IT shines forth in the <hi>Exaltation of the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God in the forgiveness of sins.</hi> There is no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate
conception of the Divine Nature, than that of
<hi>Justice</hi> in Rule and Government. Hereunto it belongs
to punish sin according unto its desert: And herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
the first actings of God as the Governour of the
Rational Creation; They did so in the Eternal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58587:61"/>
of the <hi>Angels</hi> that sinned, and the casting of <hi>Adam.</hi>
out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> an Emblem also of everlasting Ruin.
Now all the Church, all the Elect of God are sinners:
They were so in <hi>Adam;</hi> they have been and are so in
themselves. What doth become the Justice of God to
do thereon? Shall it dismiss them all unpunished? Where
then is that Justice which <hi>spared not the Angels</hi> who sinned
nor <hi>Adam</hi> at the first? Would this procedure have any
consonancy thereunto, be reconcilable unto it? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Establishment of the Righteousness of God on the
one hand, and the forgiveness of sin on the other, seem
so contradictory, as that many stumble and fall at it eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
see <hi>Ram.</hi> 10. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>BUT in this interposition of Christ, in this <hi>Translation</hi>
of punishment from the Church unto him, by vertue of
his Conjunction therewith, there is a blessed harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Righteousness of the God, and the forgiveness of
sins; the exemplification whereof, is his Eternal Glory.
<hi>O Blessed Change! O Sweet permutation;</hi> as <hi>Justine Martyr</hi>
speaks.</p>
               <p>BY Vertue of his Union with the Church, which of
his own accord he entred into, and his undertaking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to answer for it in the sight of God, it was a righteous
thing with God, to lay the <hi>punishment of all our sins upon
him,</hi> so as that he might freely and graciously pardon them
all, to the Honour and Exaltation of his Justice, as well
as of his Grace and Mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25, 26.</p>
               <p>HEREIN is he <hi>Glorious</hi> in the sight of God, Angels
and Men. In him there is at the same time, in the same
Divine Actings, a Glorious Resplendency of <hi>Justice and
Mercy;</hi> of the one in punishing; of the other in pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The appearing inconsistency between the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God and the Salvation of sinners, wherewith the
Consciences of convinced Persons are exercised and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and which is the Rock at which most of them split
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58587:61"/>
themselves into Eternal Ruin, is herein removed and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away. In his Cross were Divine Holiness and Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive
Justice exercised and manifested; and through his
Triumph Grace and Mercy are exerted to the utmost.
This is that Glory which ravisheth the Hearts, and satiates
the Souls of them that believe. For what can they desire
more, what is farther needful unto the Rest and Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of their Souls, than at one view to behold God eternally
well pleased in the declaration of his Righteousness, and
the exercise of his Mercy, in order unto their Salvation?
In due apprehensions hereof, let my Soul live; in the
faith hereof let me dye, and let present Admiration of
this Glory make way for the eternal enjoyment of it in
its beauty and fulness.</p>
               <p>HE is <hi>Glorious</hi> in that the <hi>Law of God</hi> in its <hi>Preceptive
part,</hi> or as unto the Obedience which it required, was
perfectly fulfilled and accomplished. That it should
be so, was absolutely necessary from the Wisdom, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Righteousness of him, by whom it was given:
For what could be more remote from those Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
than to give a Law, which never was to be
fulfilled in them unto whom it was given, and who were
to have the advantages of it? This could not be done
by us; But through the Obedience of Christ by vertue
of this his <hi>Mystical Conjunction</hi> with the Church, the Law
was so fulfilled in us by being fulfilled for us, as that
the Glory of God in the giving of it, and annexing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Rewards unto it, is exceedingly exalted, see <hi>Rom.</hi>
8. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>THIS is that Glory of Christ whereof one view by
faith, will scatter all the fears, answer all the objections,
and give relief against all the Despondencies of poor
tempted, doubting souls; and an <hi>Anchor</hi> it will be unto
all believers, which they may cast within the Vail, to
hold them firm and stedfast in all Tryals, Storms and
Temptations in Life and Death.</p>

               <p>ANOTHER instance of the Glory of Christ which
we are to behold here by Faith, and hope that
we shall do so by sight hereafter, consists in the <hi>Mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Communication of himself and all the Benefits of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation,
unto the souls of them that do believe, to their present
happiness and future eternal Blessedness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HEREBY he becomes theirs as they are his; which is
the Life, the Glory and Consolation of the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi>
6. 3. <hi>Chap. 2. 16. Chap.</hi> 3. 10. He and all that he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
appropriated unto them by vertue of their Mystical
Union; There is, there must be some Ground, formal
Reason and Cause of this Relation between Christ and
the Church, whereby <hi>he is theirs,</hi> and <hi>they are his;</hi> he is
in them, and they in him; so as it is not between him
and other Men in the World.</p>
               <p>THE Apostle speaking of this <hi>Communication</hi> of
Christ unto the Church, and the Union between them,
which doth ensue thereon, affirms that is a <hi>Great Mystery;</hi>
for <hi>I speak,</hi> saith he, <hi>concerning Christ and the Church,</hi> Ephes.
5. 32.</p>
               <p>I SHALL very briefly enquire into the Causes, Ways
and Means of this <hi>Mysterious Communication</hi> whereby he is
made to be ours, to be in us, to dwell with us, and all
the benefits of his Mediation to belong unto us: For, as
was said, it is evident that he doth not thus communicate
himself unto all by a <hi>natural Necessity,</hi> as the Sun gives
light equally unto the whole World; nor is he <hi>present
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58587:62"/>
withall</hi> by an <hi>Vbiquity of his humane Nature;</hi> nor as some
dream, by a <hi>Diffusion of his rational Soul</hi> into all; nor
doth he become ours by a <hi>carnal eating</hi> of him in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;
but this <hi>Mystery</hi> proceeds from, and depends
on other Reasons and Causes, as we shall briefly declare.</p>
               <p>BUT yet before I proceed to declare the way and
manner whereby Christ communicateth himself unto the
Church, I must premise something of <hi>Divine Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
in General, and their Glory. And I shall do this
by touching a little on the harmony and Correspondency
that is between the Old Creation and the New.</p>
               <p>1. ALL <hi>Being, Power, Goodness,</hi> and Wisdom were
originally, essentially, infinitely in God: And in them
with the other Perfections of his Nature, consisted his
Essential Glory.</p>
               <p>2. THE Old Creation was a <hi>Communication</hi> of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Goodness by Almighty Power, directed by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Wisdom, unto all things that were created for the
manifestation of that Glory. This was the first <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi>
of God unto any thing without himself, and it
was exceeding glorious, see <hi>Psal. 19. 1. Rom. 1. 21.</hi> And
it was a <hi>curious Machine,</hi> framed in the subordination and
dependency of one thing on another, without which
they could not subsist, nor have a continuance of their
Beings. All Creatures below live on the Earth, and the
products of it; the Earth for its whole <hi>production</hi> depends
on the Sun and other Heavenly Bodies, as God declares,
Hos. 2. 21, 22. <hi>I will hear, saith the Lord, I will hear the
Heavens and they shall hear the Earth, and the Earth shall hear
the Corn, and the Wine, and the Oil, and they shall bear Jez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reel.</hi>
God hath given a subordination of things in a
Concatenation of Causes whereon their Subsistence doth
depend. Yet,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:58587:63"/>
4. IN this mutual Dependency on, and Supplies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one another, they all depend on, and are influenced
from God himself, the Eternal Fountain of Being, Power,
and Goodness. He <hi>hears the Heavens;</hi> and in the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
of this Order by constant Divine Communication
of Being, Goodness and Power, unto all Things, God is no
less glorified than in the first Creation of them, <hi>Act. 14.
15, 16, 17. Chap. 17. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. THIS Glory of God is <hi>visible</hi> in the Matter of it,
and is obvious unto the Reason of Mankind; for from his
Works of Creation and Providence they may learn his
Eternal Power and Godhead, wherein he is essentially
glorious.</p>
               <p>6. BUT by this divine Communication God did not
intend only to glorifie himself in the essential Properties of
his Nature, but his <hi>Existence</hi> also in <hi>Three Persons, of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son and Spirit.</hi> For although the whole Creation in
its first framing, and in its Perfection, was and is by an
Emanation of Power and Goodness from the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the Person of the Father, as he is the Fountain of
the Trinity, whence he is said peculiarly to be the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of all things; yet the immediate <hi>Operation</hi> in the
Creation was from the <hi>Son,</hi> the Power and Wisdom of
the Father, <hi>Joh. 1. 1, 2, 3. Col. 1. 16. Heb. 1. 3.</hi> And
as upon the first Production of the Mass of the Creation,
it was under the especial care of the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and cherish it, unto the production of all distinct
sorts of Creatures, <hi>Gen. 1. 2.</hi> So in the Continuance of
the whole there is an especial <hi>Operation of the same Spirit</hi> in
all things. Nothing can subsist one Moment by vertue
of the Dependance which all things have on one another,
without a continual Emanation of Power from him, see
<hi>Psal. 104. 29, 30.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BY these divine <hi>Communications</hi> in the production and
preservation of the Creature, doth God manifest his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58587:63"/>
and by them alone in the way of Nature he doth so;
and without them, although he would have been for ever
essentially glorious, yet was it impossible that his Glory
should be known unto any but himself. Wherefore on
these divine <hi>Communications</hi> doth depend the whole Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
of the Glory of God. But this is far more
eminent, though not in the outward Effects of it so visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the new Creation, as we shall see.</p>
               <p>1. ALL <hi>Goodness, Grace, Life, Light, Mercy and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
which are the Springs and Causes of the New Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
are all originally in God, in the divine Nature, and
that infinitely and essentially. In them is God eternally
or essentially glorious, and the whole Design of the <hi>New
Creation</hi> was to manifest his Glory in them by external
Communications of them and from them.</p>
               <p>2. THE first Communication of, and from these
things, is made unto Christ as the <hi>Head of the Church.</hi> For
in the first place, it pleased <hi>God that in him should all the
fulness of these things dwell,</hi> so as that the whole <hi>New Creation</hi>
might <hi>consist</hi> in him, <hi>Col. 1. 17, 18, 19.</hi> And this was
the first Egress of divine Wisdom for the Manifestation
of the Glory of God in these holy Properties of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For,</p>
               <p>3. THIS Communication was made unto him as a
<hi>Repository</hi> and Treasury of all that Goodness, Grace, Life,
Light, Power and Mercy which were necessary for the
Constitution and Preservation of the New Creation. They
were to be laid up in him, to be hid in him, to dwell in
him; and from him to be communicated unto the whole
Mystical Body designed unto him, that is the Church.
And this is the first <hi>Emanation</hi> of divine Power and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
for the Manifestation of his Glory in the New Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
This Constitution of Christ as the <hi>Head</hi> of it, and
the Treasuring up in him, all that was necessary for its
Production and Preservation, wherein the Church is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58587:64"/>
and preordained in him unto Grace and Glory, is the
Spring and Fountain of divine Glory in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
that ensue thereon.</p>
               <p>4. THIS <hi>Communication</hi> unto Christ is (1.) Unto his
Person; and then (2.) With respect unto this Office. It
is in the Person of Christ that <hi>all Fulness</hi> doth originally
dwell. On the Assumption of human Nature into perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Union with the Son of God, all Fulness dwells in him
bodily, <hi>Col. 2. 9.</hi> And thereon receiving the Spirit
in all Fulness, and not by Measure, all the Treasures
of Wisdom and Knowledge were <hi>hid</hi> in him, <hi>Col. 2.
3.</hi> and he was filled with the unsearchable <hi>Riches</hi>
of Divine Grace, <hi>Ephes. 3. 8, 9, 10, 11.</hi> And the
<hi>Office</hi> of Christ is nothing but the way appointed in
the Wisdom of God, for the Communication of the
Treasures of Grece, which were communicated unto his
Person. This is the end of the whole <hi>Office</hi> of Christ in all
the parts of it, as he is a <hi>Priest,</hi> a <hi>Prophet</hi> and a <hi>King.</hi>
They are, I say, nothing but the Ways appointed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Wisdom for the Communication of the Grace laid
up in his Person unto the Church. The transcendent Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hereof, we have in some weak measure enquired into.</p>
               <p>5. THE Decree of <hi>Election</hi> prepared, if I may so say,
the <hi>Mass of the New Creation.</hi> In the old<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Creation, God
first prepared and created the <hi>Mass</hi> or Matter of the whole,
which afterwards by the Power of the holy Spirit, was
formed into all the distinct Beings whereof the whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
was to consist; and animated according to their
distinct Kinds.</p>
               <p>AND in order unto the Production and Perfecting of
the Work of the new Creation, God did from Eternity
in the holy purpose of his Will <hi>prepare,</hi> and in design <hi>set
apart</hi> unto himself, that Portion of Mankind whereof it
was to consist. Hereby they were only the <hi>peculiar Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
that was to be wrought upon by the Holy Ghost, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:58587:64"/>
the glorious Fabrick of the Church erected out of it.
What was said, it may be, of the Natural Body, by the
<hi>Psalmist,</hi> is true of the Mystical Body of Christ, which
is principally intended, <hi>Psal. 139. 15, 16. My substance
was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
wrought in the lowest parts of the earth: Thine eyes did
see my substance yet being imperfect, and in thy Book all my
members were written which in continuance were fashioned,
when as yet there was none of them.</hi> The substance of the
Church whereof it was to be formed, was under the Eye
of God, as proposed in the <hi>Decree of Election;</hi> yet was it
as such imperfect. It was not formed or shaped into
Members of the Mystical Body. But they were all
written in the <hi>Book of Life.</hi> And in pursuance of the
Purpose of God, there they are by the holy Spirit in the
whole course and continuance of time in their several
Generations fashioned into the Shape designed for them.</p>
               <p>6. THIS therefore is herein, the glorious Order of
divine Communications. From the infinite eternal Spring
of Widsom, Grace, Goodness, and Love in the <hi>Father,</hi>
all the Effects whereof unto his end were treasured up in
the Person and Mediation of the <hi>Son;</hi> the holy Spirit
unto whom the actual <hi>Application</hi> of them is committed,
communicates <hi>Life, Light, Power, Grace</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> unto
all that are designed parts of the <hi>New Creation.</hi> Hereon
doth God glorifie both the essential Properties of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
his infinite <hi>Wisdom, Power, Goodness</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> as
the only eternal Spring of all these things; and also his
ineffable glorious <hi>Existence</hi> in three Persons, by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Communication of these things unto the Church,
which are originally from his Nature. And herein is the
glorious Truth of the <hi>Blessed Trinity,</hi> which by some is
opposed, by some neglected, by most looked on as that
which is so much above them, as that it doth not belong
unto them, made precious unto them that believe, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58587:65"/>
becomes the Foundation of their Faith and Hope. In a
View of the glorious Order of those divine Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
we are in a steady Contemplation of the ineffable
Glory of the Existence of the Nature of God in the Three
distinct Persons of Father, Son and Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>7. ACCORDING unto this <hi>Divine Order</hi> the Elect in
all Ages are by the holy Spirit moving and acting on that
<hi>Mass of the New Creation,</hi> formed and animated with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Life, Light, Grace and Power unto the Glory of
God. They are not called accidentally according unto
the external Occasions and Causes of their Conversion
unto God; but in every Age, at his own Time and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
the holy Spirit communicates these things unto them,
in the Order declared unto the Glory of God.</p>
               <p>8. AND in the same manner is the whole <hi>New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
preserved every Day: every <hi>moment</hi> there is vital
Power and Strength, Mercy and Grace communicated in
this Divine Order to all Believers in the World. There
is a continual Influence from the <hi>Fountain,</hi> from the Head,
into all the Members, whereby they all <hi>consist</hi> in him, are
acted by him, who worketh in us <hi>both to will and to do of
his own good pleasure:</hi> and the Apostle declares that the
whole Constitution of <hi>Church-order</hi> is suited as an external
Instrument to promote these Divine Communications,
unto all the Members of the Church, it self <hi>Eph. 4. 13,
14, 15, 16.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS in general is the <hi>Order of Divine Communications,</hi>
which is for the Substance of it continued in Heaven, and
shall be so unto Eternity; For God is, and ever will be
<hi>all and in all.</hi> But at present, it is invisible unto Eyes of
Flesh, yea, the Reason of Men. Hence it is by the
most despised, they see no Glory in it: But let us consider
the Prayer of the Apostle, that it may be otherwise with
us, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. For the
Revelation made of the Glory of God in the old Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58587:65"/>
is exceeding inferior to that which he makes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the New.</p>
               <p>HAVING premised these things in general concerning
the <hi>Glory of Divine Communications,</hi> I shall proceed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
in particular, the Grounds and Way whereby the
Lord Christ <hi>communicates himself,</hi> and therewithal all the
Benefits of his Mediation, unto them that do believe, as it
was before proposed.</p>
               <p>WE on our part are said herein to <hi>receive him,</hi> and
that by Faith, <hi>John</hi> 1. 11, 12. Now where he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by us, he must be tendred, given, granted, or
communicated unto us. And this he is by some divine
Acts of the Father, and some of his own.</p>
               <p>THE Foundation of the whole is laid in a Soveraign
Act of the Will, the Pleasure, the Grace of the <hi>Father.</hi>
And this is the Order and Method of all divine Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the Way and Work of Grace. They originally
proceed all from him; and having effected their Ends, do
return, rest, and center in him again, see <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6. Wherefore that Christ is made ours, that he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
unto us, is originally from the free Act, Grant
and Donation of the Father, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30. Rom.</hi> 5. 15,
16, 17. And hereunto sundry things do concur. As
(1.) His <hi>Eternal Purpose</hi> which he purposed in himself to
glorifie his Grace in all his Elect, by this Communication
of Christ, and the Benefits of his Mediation unto them,
which the Apostle declares at large, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. (2.) His
<hi>granting all the Elect unto Christ</hi> to be his own: so to do and
suffer for them what was antecedaneously necessary unto
the actual Communication of himself unto them. <hi>Thine
they were, and thou gavest them to me,</hi> Joh. 17. (3.) The
giving of the <hi>Promise,</hi> or the Constitution of the Rule and
Law of the Gospel, whereby a participation of Christ,
an Interest in him and all that he is, is made over and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
unto Believers, <hi>Joh. 1. 12. 1 Joh.</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3, 4.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58587:66"/>
(4.) An Act of <hi>Almighty Power,</hi> working and creating
Faith in the Souls of the Elect, enabling them to receive
Christ so exhibited and communicated unto them by the
Gospel, <hi>Ephes. 1. 19, 20. Chap.</hi> 2. 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>THESE things which I have but named, have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
into the Glory of Christ herein: For this <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi>
of him unto the Church, is an effect of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Counsel, Wisdom, Grace and Power of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>BUT they are the <hi>Acts of Christ himself</hi> herein, which
principally we enquire into, as those which manifest the
Glory of his Wisdom, Love and Condescention.</p>
               <p>AND 1. He gives and communicates unto them his
<hi>holy Spirit;</hi> the holy Spirit as peculiarly his, as granted
unto him of the Father, as inhabiting in him in all fulness.
This Spirit abiding <hi>originally</hi> as to his Person, and <hi>immea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surably</hi>
as unto his Effects and Operations in himself, he
gives unto all Believers to <hi>inhabit and abide</hi> in them also,
<hi>Joh. 14. 14. 20. 1 Cor. 6. 16, 17. Rom.</hi> 8. 8. Hence
follows an <hi>ineffable Vnion</hi> between him and them. For as
in his Incarnation he took our <hi>Nature</hi> into personal Union
with his own; so herein he takes our <hi>Persons</hi> into a <hi>Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Vnion</hi> with himself. Hereby he becomes ours, and
we are his.</p>
               <p>AND herein is he <hi>unspeakably glorious:</hi> For this Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the <hi>Inhabitation</hi> of the same Spirit in him as the
Head, and the Church as his Body, animating the whole,
is a transcendent Effect of Divine Wisdom. There is
nothing of this Nature in the whole Creation besides;
no such Union, no such mutual Communication. The
strictest Unions and Relations in Nature are but Shadows
of it. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
also is the Lord Christ <hi>precious</hi> unto them that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
but a <hi>Stone of stumbling,</hi> and a Rock of offence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Disobedient. This glorious ineffable Effect of his
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58587:66"/>
Wisdom and Grace, this rare, peculiar, singular Way of
the Communication of himself unto the Church, is by
many despised. They know, it may be, some of them,
what it is to be joyned <hi>unto an Harlot</hi> so as to become one
Flesh, but what it is to be joyned <hi>unto the Lord</hi> so as to
become one Spirit, they know not. But this Principle
and Spring of the spiritual Life of the Church, and of all
vital spiritual Motions towards God, and Things hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
wherein, and whereby our <hi>Life is hid with Christ
in God,</hi> is the Glory, the Exaltation, the Honor, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of the Church unto the Praise of the Grace of
God. The Understanding of it in its Causes, Effects,
Operations and Priviledges wherewith it is accompanied,
is to be preferred above all the Wisdom in, and of the
World.</p>
               <p>2. HE thus communicates himself unto us, by the
<hi>Formation of a new Nature,</hi> his own Nature in us; so as
that the very same spiritual Nature is in him, and in the
Church. Only it is so with this difference, that in him it
is in the absolute perfection of all those glorious Graces
wherein it doth consist; in the Church it is in various
<hi>Measures</hi> and <hi>Degrees,</hi> according as he is pleased to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
it. But the <hi>same Divine Nature</hi> it is, that is in him
and us; for through the precious Promises of the Gospel,
we are made <hi>Partakers of his Divine Nature.</hi> It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for us, that he hath taken our Nature to be his,
unless he gives us also his Nature to be ours; that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plants
in our Souls all those gracious Qualifications, as
unto the Essence and Substance of them, wherewith he
himself in his human Nature is endued. This is that <hi>new
Man,</hi> that <hi>new Creature,</hi> that <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> that <hi>Spirit</hi>
which is born of the Spirit, that <hi>Transformation</hi> into the
Image of Christ, that <hi>putting of</hi> him on, that Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, whereunto in him we are created, that the
Scripture so fully testifieth unto, <hi>Joh. 3. 6. Rom. 6. 3, 4,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58587:67"/>
5, 6, 7, 8. 2 Cor. 3. 18. Chap. 5. 17. Ephes. 4. 20. 24.
2 Pet.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p>AND that new <hi>Heavenly Nature</hi> which is thus formed in
Believers, as the first vital Act of that Union which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Christ and them by the Inhabitation of the same
Spirit, is peculiarly <hi>his</hi> Nature. For both is it so as it is
in <hi>him</hi> the <hi>Idaea</hi> and the Exemplar of it in us, inasmuch
as we are predestinated to be conformed unto his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage;
and as it is wrought or produced in our Souls by
an Emanation of Power, Vertue, and Efficiency from
him.</p>
               <p>THIS is a most heavenly Way of the Communication
of himself unto us, wherein of <hi>God he is made unto us
Wisdom and Sanctification.</hi> Hereon he says of his Church,
<hi>This now is Bone of my Bone, and Flesh of my Flesh;</hi> I see
my self, my own Nature in them, whence they are
comely and desirable. Hereby he makes way to present
it to himself a <hi>glorious Church,</hi> not having Spot or Wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle,
or any such thing, but holy and wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hout Blemish.
On this Communication of Christ unto us by the forming
<hi>of his own Nature</hi> in us, depends all the Purity, the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Holiness, the inward Clory of the Church. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
is it really, substantially internally separated from
the World, and distinguished from all others, who in the
outward forms of things, in the Profession and Duties of
Religion seem to be the same with them. Hereby it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the <hi>First Fruits of the Creation unto God,</hi> bearing
forth the Renovation of his Image in the World: Herein
the Lord Christ is, and will be <hi>glorious</hi> unto all Eternity.
I only mention these things, which deserve to be far more
largely insisted on.</p>
               <p>3. HE doth the same by that <hi>actual Insitition or Implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
into himself,</hi> which he gives us by Faith; which is
of his own Operation. For hereon two Things do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue;
one by the Grace or Power, the other by the Law
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58587:67"/>
or Constitution of the Gospel, which have a great Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
into this <hi>Mystical Communication</hi> of Christ unto the
Church.</p>
               <p>AND the first of these is, that thereby there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
unto us, and we do derive <hi>Supplies of spiritual
Life,</hi> Sustentation, Motion, Strength in Grace, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance
from him continually. This is that which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so divinely teacheth in the <hi>Parable of the Vine</hi> and its
Branches, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Hereby is there a
continual Communication from his <hi>All fulness of Grace</hi> Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the whole Church, and all the Members of it, unto all
the Ends and Duties of spiritual Life. <hi>They live, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
not they,</hi> but <hi>Christ liveth in them; and the Life which
they lead</hi> in the <hi>Flesh, is by the Faith of the Son of God.</hi> And
the other, by vertue of the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Constitution</hi> of the
Gospel, is, that hereon his <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and all the Fruits
of his Mediation, are imputed unto us; the Glory of
which Mystery the Apostle unfolds, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>I MIGHT add hereunto the <hi>mutual Inbeing</hi> that is
between him and Believers by <hi>Love;</hi> for the way of the
Communication of his Love unto them, being by the
<hi>shedding of it abroad in their Hearts by the Holy Ghost,</hi> and
their returns of Love unto them being wrought in them
by an <hi>Almighty Efficiency of the same Spirit,</hi> there is that
which is deeply mysterious and glorious in it. I might
mention also the <hi>Continuation of his Discharge</hi> of all his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
towards us, whereon all our Receptions from him, or
all the Benefits of his Mediation, whereof we are made
Partakers, do depend. But the few Instances that have
been given of the Glory of Christ in this <hi>Mysterious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of himself unto his Church,</hi> may suffice to give us
such a View of it, as to fill our Hearts with holy Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Thanksgiving.</p>

all things in him.</head>
               <p>IN the last Place the Lord Christ is peculiarly and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently
glorious in the Re-capitulation <hi>of all things
in him,</hi> after they had been scattered and disordered by
sin. This the Apostle proposeth as the most signal Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Divine Wisdom, and the soveraign Pleasure of
God.</p>
               <p>HE hath abounded towards us in all Wisdom and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
having made known unto us the Mystery of his Will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
unto his good Pleasure, which he hath purposed in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
That in the Dispensation of the fulness of time, he might
gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in
the Heavens, and which are on Earth, even in him, <hi>Ephes.</hi>
1. 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>FOR the Discovery of the Mind of the Holy Ghost
in these Words, so far as I am at present concerned,
namely, as unto the <hi>Representation of the Glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Christ in
them,</hi> sundry brief Observations must be premised; and
in them it will be necessary that we briefly declare the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
of all these things in Heaven and Earth, their
Primitive Order, the Confusion that ensued thereon, with
their Restitution in Christ, and his Glory thereby.</p>
               <p>GOD alone hath all being in him. Hence he gives
himself that Name, I AM, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 14. He was eternally
<hi>All;</hi> when all things else that ever were, or now are, or
shall be, were nothing. And when they are, they are no
otherwise, but as <hi>they are of him, and from him, and to him,</hi>
Rom. 11. 36. Moreover his <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> are the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58587:68"/>
same. The <hi>Goodness</hi> of Good is the Meetness of the
<hi>Divine Being</hi> to be communicative of it self in its Effects.
Hence this is the first Notion of the <hi>Divine Nature, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Being and Goodness in a Nature intelligent and self-subsistent.</hi>
So the Apostle declares it, <hi>He that cometh unto God must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he is, and that he is a Rewarder,</hi> Heb. 11. 6.</p>
               <p>2. IN this State of <hi>Infinite, Eternal Being and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
antecedent unto any Act of Wisdom or Power without
himself, to give Existence unto other Things, God was,
and is eternally in himself all that he will be, all that he
can be, unto Eternity. For where there is Infinite Being
and Infinite Goodness, there is Infinite Blessedness and
Happiness, whereunto nothing can be added. God is
always the same. That is his Name <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 102.
27. <hi>Thou art he,</hi> always the same. All things that are,
make no addition unto God, no change in his State. His
Blessedness, Happiness, Self-satisfaction, as well as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Infinite Perfections, were absolutely the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Creation of any thing, whilst there was nothing
but himself, as they are since he hath made all things:
For the Blessedness of God consists in the <hi>ineffable mutual
Inbeing</hi> of the Three holy Persons in the same Nature,
with the immanent reciprocal Actings of the Father and
the Son in the eternal Love and Complacency of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
Hereunto nothing can be added, herein no Change
can be made by any external Work or Effect of Power.
Herein doth God act in the perfect Knowledge, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Love of his own Perfections unto an infinite Acquies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
therein, which is the Divine Blessedness. This
gives us the true Notion of the Divine Nature antecedent
unto the Manifestation of it made by any outward Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
Infinite Being and Goodness eternally blessed in
the Knowledge and Enjoyment of it self by incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable,
ineffable, internal Actings answering the manner
of its Subsistence, which is in three distinct Persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:58587:69"/>
3. THIS <hi>Being and Goodness</hi> of God by his own Will
and Pleasure, acting themselves in Infinite Wisdom and
Power, produced the Creation of all things. Herein he
communicated a finite, limited, dependent Being and
Goodness unto other things without himself. For all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Goodness being, as was said, in him alone, it
was necessary that the first outward Work and Effect of
the Divine Nature must be the Communication of Being
and Goodness into other things. Wherefore as when he
had given unto every thing its <hi>Being</hi> out of nothing by
the Word of his Power, saying, <hi>Let them be, and they
were;</hi> so it is said, that he looked on all that he had
made, and behold, <hi>they were exceeding good,</hi> Gen. 1. last.
Being and Goodness must be the first outward Effects of
the Divine Nature, which being wrought by Infinite Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Wisdom, do represent unto us the Glory of God in
the Creation of all things. Infinite Being in Self-sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence,
which is necessary in the first Cause and Spring
of all things; Infinite Goodness to communicate the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of this Being unto that which was not, and Infinite
Wisdom and Power in that Communication, are glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
manifested therein.</p>
               <p>4. IN this State, all things that were made, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>immediately</hi> on God himself, without the Interposition
of any other Head of Influence or Rule. They had the
Continuance of their Being and its Preservation, from the
immediate Actings of these Properties of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
whereby they were made; and their Dependance on
God was by Vertue of that Law, which was implanted
on the Principles and Powers of their several Natures by
God himself.</p>
               <p>5. THUS <hi>in the beginning God created the Heavens and
the Earth.</hi> He provided himself of <hi>two distinct Rational
Families,</hi> that should depend on him according to a Law
of Moral Obedience, and thereby give Glory to him;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58587:69"/>
with two distinct Habitations for them cognate unto their
Nature and Use; Heaven above, and the Earth beneath.
The Earth he appointed for the Habitation of Man, which
was every way suited unto the Constitution of his Nature,
the Preservation of his Being, and the End of his Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in giving Glory to God. Heaven he prepared for
the Habitation of the Angels, which was suited unto the
Constitution of their Nature, the Preservation of their
Being, and the End of their Creation in giving Glory to
God. Wherefore as <hi>Man</hi> had Power and Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all things here below, and was to use them all unto
the Glory of God, by which means God received Glory
from them also, though in themselves bruit and inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate;
so the <hi>Angels</hi> had the like Dominion over the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
and Aetherial Bodies, wherewith God had fitted
the Place of their Habitation, that through the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
and Use of them, God might have a Revenue
of Glory and Praise from them also. To suppose any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Race of <hi>Intellectual Creatures,</hi> besides Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and Men on Earth, is not only without all Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
from any Divine Testimony, but it disturbs and
disorders the whole Representation of the Glory of God
made unto us in the Scripture, and the whole Design of
his Wisdom and Grace as declared therein. <hi>Intellectual
Creatures</hi> not comprehended in that Government of God,
and Mystery of his Wisdom in Christ, which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
Reveals, are a <hi>Chimera</hi> framed in the Imaginations of
some Men, scarce duly sensible of what it is to be <hi>wise unto
Sobriety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. THIS Order of things was <hi>beautiful</hi> and comely.
Hence were they all said to be <hi>exceeding good.</hi> For each
of these Families had their <hi>own immediate, distinct Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi>
on God. He was the immediate Head of them.
There was no other common Head interposed between
God and them. They were not an Head unto one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58587:70"/>
There were no Communications unto them, but
what were immediate from God himself. And their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
among themselves was in this alone, that all their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
did meet and center in God. So God made the
Heavens and the Earth, and two distinct Families in them
for himself.</p>
               <p>7. THIS beautiful Order in it self, this Union between
the two Families of God, was disturbed, broken, dissolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Entrance of Sin: For hereby part of the Family
above, and the whole Family below, fell off from their
Dependance on God, and ceasing to center in him as their
Head, they fell into Variance and Enmity among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
For the Center of this Union and Order being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
and lost, nothing but Enmity and Confusion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
among them. Hereon to shew that its Goodness
was lost, God cursed the Earth and all that was in it; for
it was put in Subjection unto Man, who was now fallen
from him: Howbeit he cursed not the Heavens which
were in Subjection unto the Angels, because some of them
only left their Habitation; and the Habitation of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue
was not to be cursed for their Sakes. But Mankind
was wholly gone off from God.</p>
               <p>8. THE Angels that sinned, God utterly rejected for
ever as an Example of his Severity; the whole Race of
Mankind he would not utterly cast off, but determined
to recover and save a Remnant according to the Election
of Grace; which how he did it in a way of Condecency
unto all his Divine Perfections, I have elsewhere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>9. HOWBEIT he would not restore them into their
former State, so as to have again two distinct Families,
each in an immediate Dependance on himself, though he
left them in different and distinct Habitations, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 15.
But he would gather them both into one, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a new Head, in whom the one Part should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58587:70"/>
from sinning, and the other delivered from sin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>10. THIS then is that which the Apostle declares in
these Words, <hi>To gather together in one all things which are
in Heaven, and which are in Earth; even in him.</hi> And so
he again expresseth it, <hi>Col. 1. 20. To reconcile all things
unto himself in him, whether they are things in Heaven, or
things in Earth, all things were</hi> fallen into disorder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
by sin; they were fallen off from God into vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
among themselves. God would not restore them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their first Order in an immediate Dependance on his
Divine Perfections. He would no longer keep them in
two distinct Families; but he would in his infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Goodness gather them up into <hi>one common Head,</hi>
on whom they should have their immediate Dependance,
and be reconciled again among themselves.</p>
               <p>11. THIS <hi>New Head,</hi> wherein God hath gathered up
all things in Heaven and Earth into one; one Body, one
Family, on whom is all their dependance, in whom they
all now consist, is <hi>Jesus Christ the Son of God incarnate,</hi> see
1 <hi>Cor. 11. 3. Eph.</hi> 1. 21, 22, 23. This Glory was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
for him; none other could be meet for it, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of it, see <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 17, 18, 19, 20</p>
               <p>12. TO answer all the Ends of this <hi>New Head</hi> of Gods
<hi>recollected Family,</hi> all Power in Heaven and Earth, all Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Grace and Glory, is committed unto him. There
is no Communication from God, no Act of Rule towards
this Family, no Supply of Vertue, Power, Grace or
Goodness unto Angels or Men, but what is immediately
from this <hi>New Head,</hi> whereinto they are gathered. In him
they all consist, on him do they depend, unto him are
they subject; in their Relation unto him doth their Peace,
Union and Agreement among themselves consist. This
is the <hi>Recapitulation of all things</hi> intended by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:58587:71"/>
13. IT is true, that he acts distinctly and variously
towards the two parts of the <hi>Recollected Family</hi> of Angels
and Men, according as their different States and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
do require. For (1.) We had need of a Reparation
by Redemption and Grace, which the Angels had not.
(2.) Angels were capable of immediate Confirmation in
Glory, which we are not, until we come to Heaven.
Therefore (1.) He assumed our Nature that it might be
repaired; which he did not the Nature of the Angels.
(2.) He gives us Union unto himself, by his Spirit, which
exalts us into a Dignity and Honour, meet for Fellowship
with them in the same Family.</p>
               <p>THIS is a brief Account of the mysterious Work of
Divine Wisdom in the <hi>Recapitulation</hi> of all things in Jesus
Christ; and herein is he transcendently glorious; or his
Glory herein is far above our Comprehension: Yet some
few things may be observed to direct us in the View and
Contemplation of it. As,</p>
               <p>1. HE alone was a <hi>meet and capable Subject of it.</hi> He
only could bear the weight of this Glory. No meet
Creature in Heaven or Earth was meet to be thus made
the Head of the whole new Creation of God. In none
of them could all things consist. None of them was meet
to be thus in the Place of God, to have all things depend
upon him, and be put in subjection unto him, so as that
there should be no Communication between God and the
Creation, but by and through him alone. Wherefore
when the holy Ghost assigns this Glory unto him, he so
describes him, as that we may discern his singular meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for it; as that he is the <hi>Brightness of the Fathers Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the express Image of his Person, upholding all things
by the Word of his Power, Heb. 1. 3.</hi> That he is the <hi>Image
of the invisible God, the first born of every Creature, by whom
all things were created, that are in Heaven, and that are in
the Earth, visible and invisible, whether they be Thrones, or
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58587:71"/>
Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers, all things were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by him, and for him, and he is before all things, and by him
all things consist, Col.</hi> 1. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. Such
an one alone and no other was meet to bear and uphold
this Glory, And the Glory of his Person is such as that
it is the Blessedness of all Creatures to center in this Glory
of his Office.</p>
               <p>2. THIS is that Glory which God designed unto his
only Son incarnate; and it gives us a little View into the
Glory of that Mystery, the wonderful eternal Design of God
to glorifie himself in the Incarnation of Christ. God would
have his eternal, his only begotten Son to be incarnate,
to take our Nature on him, to be made Man. What is his
Design in this incomprehensible Work of his Wisdom,
Love and Power? Indeed in the first place, it was for the
<hi>Redemption of the Church,</hi> by the Sacrifice of himself and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Acts of his Mediation. But there is that which is
more general and comprehensive, and wherein all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of the Glory of God do center. And this was that
he might <hi>gather all things into one</hi> in him, that the whole
Creation, especially that which was to be eternally blessed,
should have a new Head given unto it for its Sustentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Preservation, Order, Honor and Safety. All Springs
are in him, and all Streams are unto him, and in and by
him unto God. Who can express the Divine Beauty, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Harmony of all things that are in this their <hi>Reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation</hi>
in Christ? The Union and Communion between
Angels and Men, the Order of the whole Family in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, the Communication of Life, Grace, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
Mercy and Consolation to the Church, the Rule and
Disposal of all things unto the Glory of God, do all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
hereon. This Glory God designed unto his Son
incarnate, and it was the greatest, the highest that could
be communicated unto him. For as the Apostle observes,
<hi>All things are put in subjection unto him, he only excepted

1 Cor. 15.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THERE is no Contemplation of the Glory of Christ
that ought more to affect the Hearts of them that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
with Delight and Joy, than this of the <hi>Recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
of all things in him. One View by Faith of him
in the place of God as the supream Head of the whole
Creation, moving, acting, guiding and disposing of it,
will bring in spiritual Refreshment unto a believing
Soul.</p>
               <p>AND it will do so the more, in that it gives a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Representation of his Divine Nature also. For that
any meer Creature should thus be an Head of Life, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Power, as also of soveraign Rule, and disposal
of the wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le new Creation, with all things reduced into
order thereby, is not only an impious, but a foolish Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
               <p>DID we live more in the Contemplation of this Glory
of Christ, and of the Wisdom of God in this <hi>Recapitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of all things in him, there is not any thing of our
<hi>Duty</hi> which it would not mind us of, nor any thing of
<hi>Priviledge</hi> which it would not give us a Sence of, as might
easily be demonstrated.</p>
               <p>3. IN particular, the Lord Christ is glorious herein,
in that the whole Breach made on the Glory of God in
the Creation by the Entrance of Sin, is hereby repaired
and made up. The Beauty and Order of the whole
Creation consisted in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s dependance on God by the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of the rational Part of it, Angels and Men.
Thereby were the being, the goodness, the wisdom and
power of God made manifest. But the Beauty of this
Order was defaced, and the Manifestation of the Divine
Perfections unto the glory of God eclipsed by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of Sin. But all is restored, repaired and made up
in this <hi>Recapitulation</hi> of all things in one <hi>new Head</hi> Christ
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58587:72"/>
Jesus; yea, the whole curious Frame of the Divine Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
is rendred more beautiful than it was before. Hence
the whole of it groaneth for the Interest of each Part in
this Restauration of all things. Whatever there is of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
of Beauty, of Glory in Heaven above, or in Earth
beneath, it all ariseth from this new Relation of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto the Son of God. Whatever is not gathered
into one, even in him, in its place and according to its
measure, is under Darkness, Disorder and the Curse.
Hence the <hi>Jews</hi> have a saying, that <hi>in the days of the
Messiah all things shall be healed but the Serpent,</hi> that is the
Devil, and wicked Men which are as his Seed.</p>
               <p>4. HE is glorious herein, in that he is appointed as
the only means of exerting, and expressing all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the Infinite Wisdom of God towards his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
The Wisdom of God is absolutely, always and in
all things Infinite. God doth not, God cannot act with
more Wisdom in one thing than in another; as in the
Creation of man than in that of any inanimate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
In the first Creation Infinite Wisdom was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable
companion of Infinite Power. <hi>How marvellous
are thy works, O Lord! in Wisdom hast thou made them all.</hi>
But when the effects of this Divine Wisdom in their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
beauty and glory were defaced, greater Treasures
of Wisdom were required unto their Reparation. And
in this <hi>Recollection</hi> of all things in Christ did God lay them
forth unto the utmost of whatever he will do in dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with his Creatures; so the Apostle expresseth it,
Ephes. 3. 10. <hi>To the intent that now unto the principalities
and powers in heavenly places might be known by the Church the
manifold wisdom of God.</hi> By the <hi>Recapitulation</hi> of all things
into this one head, the manifold various unsearchable
Wisdom of God was made known unto the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
They knew not before of the Design and Work
of God after the Entrance of Sin. These could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:58587:73"/>
the Wisdom that might repair that Loss. They
knew not that Divine Wisdom had another way to take
herein, at least they knew not what way that should be.
But hereby the manifold Wisdom of God, his infinite
Wisdom in the Treasures of it, able by various ways to
attain the ends of his Glory, was made known unto them.
Herein, namely, in the <hi>Recollection</hi> of all things in Christ,
Divine Wisdom hath made known and represented it self
in all its Stores and Treasures unto Angels and Men. <hi>In
him are hid,</hi> and by him are displayed, <hi>all the treasures of
Wisdom,</hi> Col. 2. 3. Herein is he glorious, and will be
so to Eternity.</p>
               <p>5. He is glorious herein, in that hereby <hi>firmness and
security is communicated unto the whole new Creation.</hi> The
first Creation in its Order was a curious and glorious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick.
But every thing depending immediately on God
by vertue of the Principles of its own Nature, and the
Law of its Obedience, all was brought unto a Loss by
the sin of Angels and Men. But now every thing that
belongs unto this new Creation, even every Believer in
the World as well as the Angels in Heaven being gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together in this one Head, the whole and all, and every
part and member of it, even every particular Believer are
secured from Ruine, such as befel all things before. In
this <hi>New Head</hi> they have an indissoluble Consistency.</p>
               <p>BUT <hi>manum de Tabula.</hi> I shall insist on no more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of this Nature which plentifully offer themselves in
the Scripture unto us. For who can declare this glory
of Christ? Who can speak of these things as he ought? I
am so far from designing to set forth the whole of it, that
I am deeply sensible how little a Portion I can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
of the least part of it. Nor can I attain unto any
Satisfaction in these Meditations, but what Issue in an
humble Admiration.</p>

               <head type="sub">Differences between our beholding the Glory of
Christ by Faith in this World, and by
sight in Heaven. The first of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>WE walk here by faith, and not by sight, 2 Cor. 5.
7.</hi> That is, in the Life of God, in our walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before him, in the whole of our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
therein, we are under the Conduct and Influence
of <hi>Faith</hi> and not of <hi>Sight.</hi> Those are the two spiritual
Powers of our Souls; by the one whereof, we are made
Partakers of Grace, Holiness and Obedience in this Life;
and by the other of eternal Blessedness and Glory.</p>
               <p>BOTH these, namely, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Sight,</hi> the one in this
Life, the other in that which is to come, have the same
immediate Object. For they are the Abilities of the Soul
to go forth unto, and to embrace their Object. Now
this Object of them both, is <hi>the Glory of Christ,</hi> as hath
been declared, as also what that glory is, and wherein it
doth consist; wherefore my present Design is to enquire
into the <hi>difference that is between our beholding of the Glory
of Christ in this World by Faith, and the Vision which we shall
have of the same Glory hereafter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE <hi>latter of these</hi> is peculiarly intended in that Prayer
of our Lord Jesus Christ for his Disciples, Joh. 17. 24.
<hi>Father I will that they also whom thou hast given me, may be
with me where I am, that they may behold my Glory which
thou hast given me.</hi> But I shall not distinctly insist upon it,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58587:74"/>
my design being another way, respecting principally
the <hi>Work of God in this Life,</hi> and the Priviledges which
we enjoy thereby: Yet I shall now take a short Prospect
of that also; not absolutely, but in the Differences that
are between <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Sight,</hi> or the View which we have
of the glory of Christ in this World by <hi>Faith,</hi> and that
which they enjoy by <hi>Vision</hi> who are above; the Object of
them both being adequately the same.</p>
               <p>BUT herein also, I shall have respect only unto <hi>some
of those things</hi> which concern our Practise, or the present
immediate Exercise of Faith. For I have elsewhere
handled at large the <hi>State of the Church above,</hi> or that of
present glory; giving an account of the Administration
of the <hi>Office of Christ in Heaven,</hi> his Presence among the
glorified Souls, and the Adoration of God under his
Conduct: I have also declared the Advantage which they
have by being with him, and the Prospect they have of
his glory. Therefore these things must here be only
touched on:</p>
               <p>THESE Differences may be referred unto two heads.
(1.) Those which arise from the <hi>different Natures</hi> and
Actings of those <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Instruments</hi> whereby we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
this glory of Christ, namely, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
And (2.) Those that arise from the different <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi>
produced by them. Instances in each kind shall be
given.</p>
               <p>1. THE <hi>View</hi> which we have of the glory of Christ
by Faith in this World, is <hi>obscure, dark, inevident, reflexive.</hi>
So the Apostle declares, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 12. Now we see
through a Glass darkly</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Through or by
a Glass in a Riddle,</hi> a Parable, a dark Saying. There is
a double <hi>figurative</hi> Limitation put upon our View of the
glory of Christ, taken from the two ways of our Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what we apprehend, namely, the <hi>Sight</hi> of things,
and the <hi>hearing</hi> of Words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:58587:74"/>
THE first is, that we have this View not <hi>directly,</hi> but
<hi>reflexively,</hi> and by way of a Representation, as in a <hi>Glass.</hi>
For I take the Glass here, not to be <hi>Optical,</hi> or a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
which helps the Sight, but a <hi>Speculum,</hi> or a
Glass which reflects an Image of what we do behold. It
is a Sight like that which we have of a Man in a Glass,
when we see not his Person or Substance, but an
Image or Representation of them only, which is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>The Shadow or <hi>Image</hi> of this glory of Christ is drawn
in the Gospel, and therein we behold it as the Likeness of
a Man represented unto us in a Glass; and although it be
<hi>obscure</hi> and imperfect in comparison of his own real, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
glory, which is the Object of Vision in Heaven;
yet is it the only <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Representation</hi> of himself, which
he hath left, and given unto us in this World. That
woful cursed Invention of <hi>framing Images</hi> of him out of
Stocks and Stones however adorned, or Representations of
him by the <hi>Art of painting,</hi> are so far from presenting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Minds of Men any thing of his real glory, that
nothing can be more effectual to divert their Thoughts
and Apprehensions from it. But by this figurative Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of <hi>seeing in a Glass,</hi> the Apostle declares the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
Imperfection</hi> of our present View of the glory of
Christ.</p>
               <p>BUT the <hi>Allusion</hi> may be taken from an <hi>Optick Glass</hi> or
<hi>Tube</hi> also, whereby the sight of the Eye is helped in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
things at a great distance. By the aid of such
<hi>Glasses</hi> Men will discover Stars or heavenly Lights, which
by reason of their distance from us, the Eye of it self is
no way able to discern. And those which we do fee, are
more <hi>fully</hi> represented, though remote enough from being
so, <hi>perfectly.</hi> Such a <hi>Glass</hi> is the Gospel, without which
we can make no discovery of Christ at all, but in the use
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58587:75"/>
of it, we are far enough from beholding him in the <hi>just
dimensions</hi> of his glory.</p>
               <p>AND he adds another intimation of this Imperfection,
in an Allusion unto the way whereby things are proposed
and conveyed unto the Minds and Apprehensions of Men:
Now this is by <hi>Words.</hi> And these are either plain, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and direct, or dark, <hi>figurative</hi> and <hi>parabolical:</hi> And
this latter way makes the Conception of things to be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
and imperfect; and by reason of the imperfection of
our View of the glory of Christ by Faith in this World,
the Apostle saith, it is in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in a <hi>Riddle.</hi> These
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>Psalmist</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>darksaying,</hi> Psal. 78. 2.</p>
               <p>BUT here it must be observed, that the description
and Representation of the Lord Christ and his glory in the
Gospel, is not absolutely, or in it self either dark or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure.
Yea, it is <hi>perspicuous,</hi> plain and direct. Christ
is therein <hi>evidently set forth crucified,</hi> exalted, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.
But the Apostle doth not here discourse concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Way or Means of the Revelation of it unto us, but
of the Means or <hi>Instrument</hi> whereby we comprehend that
Revelation. This is our Faith, which as it is in us, being
weak and imperfect, we comprehend the <hi>Representation</hi>
that is made unto us of the Glory of Christ, as Men do
the sence of a <hi>dark Saying, a Riddle, a Parable,</hi> that is, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly,
and with difficulty.</p>
               <p>ON the account hereof we may say at present, <hi>How lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
a portion is it that we know of him?</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> speaks of
God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 26. 14. How imperfect are our Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of him? How weak are our Minds in their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement?
There is no part of his glory that we can ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comprehend. And what we do comprehend (as there
is a <hi>Comprehension</hi> in Faith, <hi>Eph. 3. 18.</hi>) we cannot abide in
the steady contemplation of. For ever blessed be that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Grace, whence it is that he who <hi>commanded the light
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58587:75"/>
to shine out of darkness, hath shined into our hearts to give us
the light of the knowledge of his own Glory in the face of Jesus
Christ,</hi> and therein of the glory of Christ himself; that
he hath so revealed him unto us, as that we may love
him, admire him and obey him; but constantly, steadily,
and clearly to behold his glory in this life we are not able,
for we <hi>walk by Faith and not by Sight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HENCE our sight of him here, is as it were by
<hi>Glances</hi> liable to be clouded by many interpositions. <hi>Behold
he standeth behind the wall, he looketh forth at the windows,
shewing</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> flourishing) <hi>himself at the lattess,</hi> Cant. 2. 9.
Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re is a great Interposition between him and us, as a
<hi>Wall;</hi> and the means of the discovery of himself unto us,
as through a <hi>Window</hi> and <hi>Lattess,</hi> include a great insta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and imperfection in our view and Apprehension of
him. There is a <hi>Wall</hi> between him and us, which yet
he standeth behind. Our <hi>present mortal state</hi> is this <hi>Wall,</hi>
which must be demolished before we can see him as he is.
In the mean time he looketh through the <hi>Windows</hi> of the
ordinances of the Gospel. He gives us sometimes, when
he is pleased to stand in those <hi>Windows,</hi> a view of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
but it is <hi>imperfect,</hi> as is our sight of a man through
a <hi>Window.</hi> The appearances of him at these <hi>Windows</hi>
are full of refreshment unto the souls of them that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
But our view of them is imperfect, transient, and
doth not abide: We are for the most part quickly left to
bemoan what we have lost. And then our best is but to
cry; <hi>As the hart panteth after the water-brook, so panteth my
soul after thee, O God; my soul thirsteth for God, for the living
God, when shall I come and appear before thee?</hi> When wilt
thou again give me to see thee, tho but as through the
<hi>Windows?</hi> Alas what distress do we oftentimes sit down
in, after these views of Christ and his Glory! But he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
further yet; <hi>and flourishes himself through the lattesses.</hi>
This displaying of the glory of <hi>Christ</hi> called the <hi>flourishing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

himself,</hi> is by the <hi>promises of the Gospel</hi> as they are explained
in the ministry of the word. In them are represented
unto us the desirable beauties and glories of Christ; how
precious, how amiable is he as represented in them? How
are the Souls of Believers ravished with the views of
them? Yet is this discovery of him also but as through a
<hi>Lattess.</hi> We see him but by parts, unsteadily and unevenly.</p>
               <p>SUCH I say is the sight of the glory of Christ which we
have in this world by Faith. It is <hi>dark,</hi> it is but <hi>in part.</hi>
It is but <hi>weak, transient, imperfect, partial.</hi> It is but
<hi>little</hi> that we can at any time discover of it; it is but a <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
while,</hi> that we can abide in the contemplation of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat
we do discover, <hi>rara hora, brevis mora.</hi> Sometimes it is
unto us as the Sun when it is under a Cloud, we cannot
perceive it. When he hideth his face, who then can
behold him? As <hi>Job</hi> speaks, so may we, <hi>Behold I go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
but he is not there: and backward, but I canno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> perceive
him; on the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
him; he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot
see him,</hi> chap. 23 8, 9. Which way soever we turn
our selves, and what duties soever we apply our selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
we can obtain no distinct view of his glory. Yet on
the other hand, it is sometimes as the Sun when it <hi>shines
in its brightness,</hi> and we cannot bear the rays of it. In in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
condescention he says unto his Church, <hi>Turn away
thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me,</hi> Cant. 6. 5.
As if he could not bear that overcoming affectionate
love, which looks through the eyes of the Church in
its acting of Faith on him. Ah! How much more do
we find our souls overcome with his love, when at any
he is pleased to make any clear discoveries of his glory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us!</p>
               <p>LET us now on the other hand, take a little Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of that <hi>Vision<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> which we shall have of the same
Glory in Heaven, that we may compare them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:58587:76"/>
                  <hi>VISION</hi> or the sight which we shall have of the glory
of Christ in Heaven, is <hi>immediate, direct, intuitive,</hi> and
therefore <hi>steady,</hi> even and constant: And it is so on a
double Account. (1.) Of the <hi>Object</hi> which shall be proposed
unto us. (2.) Of the <hi>Visivé Power</hi> or faculty wherewith
we shall be endued; from the imperfection of both which
in this World, ariseth the imperfection of our view of the
glory of Christ by faith, as hath been declared.</p>
               <p>1. THE <hi>Object</hi> of it will be <hi>real and substantial.</hi> Christ
himself in his own person with all his glory, shall be
continually with us, before us, proposed unto us. We
shall no longer have an <hi>Image,</hi> a Representation of him,
such as is the delineation of his Glory in the Gospel. We
<hi>shall see him,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>face to face; 1 Cor.</hi> 13. 12.
which he opposeth unto our seeing him <hi>darkly as in a glass,</hi>
which is the utmost that faith can attain to. We shall
<hi>see him as he is, 1 Joh. 3. 2,</hi> not as now in an imperfect
description of him. As a man sees his neighbour when
they stand and converse together face to face; So shall
we see the Lord Christ in his glory, and not as <hi>Moses</hi>
who had only a transient sight of some parts of the Glory
of God, when he caused it to pass by him.</p>
               <p>THERE will be use herein, of our bodily <hi>eyes,</hi> as shall
be declared. For as <hi>Job</hi> says, <hi>in our Flesh shall we see our
Redeemer,</hi> and our eyes shall behold him, Chap. 19. 25,
26, 27. That corporeal sence shall not be restored unto
us, and that glorified above what we can conceive, but
for this great use of the eternal beholding of Christ and
his Glory. Unto whom it is not a matter of rejoycing,
that with the <hi>same eyes</hi> wherewith they see the tokens and
signs of him in the Sacrament of the Supper, they shall
behold himself immediately, in his own person. But
principally, as we shall see immediately, this vision is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual.</hi>
It is not therefore the meer <hi>Human Nature</hi> of
Christ, that is the object of it, but his <hi>Divine Person</hi> as
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58587:77"/>
that nature subsisteth therein. What is that perfection
which we shall have (for <hi>that which is perfect must come and
do away that which is in part</hi>) in the comprehension of the
<hi>hypostatical Vnion,</hi> I understand not; but this I know,
that in the immediate beholding of the Person of Christ,
we shall see a glory in it a thousand times above what
here we can conceive. The excellencies of Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Love and Power therein, will be continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us. And all the glories of the Person of Christ, which
we have before weakly and faintly enquired into, will be
in our sight for evermore.</p>
               <p>HENCE the ground and cause of our Blessedness is,
that <hi>we shall be ever with the Lord,</hi> 1 Thes. 4. 17. As him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
prays, <hi>that we may be with him where he is, to behold his
glory:</hi> Here we have some dark views of it, we cannot
perfectly behold it, until <hi>we are with him</hi> where he is.
Thereon our sight of him will be direct, intuitive, and
constant.</p>
               <p>THERE is a glory, there will be so subjectively in us
in the beholding of this glory of Christ, which is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
incomprehensible. For <hi>it doth not yet appear what we
our selves shall be,</hi> 1 John, 3. 2. Who can declare what
a glory it will be in us to behold this Glory of Christ?
And how excellent then is that glory of Christ it self?</p>
               <p>THIS immediate sight of Christ, is that which all the
Saints of God in this life do breath and pant after. Hence
are they willing to be dissolved, or desire to <hi>depart, that
they may be with Christ, which is best for them,</hi> Phil. 1. 23.
They chuse to be <hi>absent from the body and present with the
Lord, 2 Cor. 5. 8.</hi> Or that they may enjoy the inexpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
longed for sight of Christ in his glory. Those who
do not so long for it, whose souls and minds are not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
visited with earnest desires after it, unto whom
the thoughts of it are not their relief in Trouble, and
their chiefest Joy, are carnal, blind, and <hi>cannot see afar off.</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:58587:77"/>
He that is truly spiritual, entertains and refresheth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with thoughts hereof continually.</p>
               <p>2. IT will be so from that <hi>Visive Power</hi> or faculty of
beholding the Glory of Christ, which we shall then receive.
Without this we cannot see him as he is. When he
was transfigured <hi>in the Mount,</hi> and had on his Human
Nature some reflections of his Divine Glory, his Disciples
that were with him, were rather amazed, than refreshed
by it. Mat. 17. 4. They saw his glory, but spake thereon
<hi>they knew not what,</hi> Luk. 9. 30, 33. And the reason here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was because no man in this life can have a <hi>Visive Power,</hi>
either spiritual, or corporeal, directly and immediately to
behold the real Glory of Christ.</p>
               <p>SHOULD the Lord Jesus appear now to any of us in
his Majesty and Glory, it would not be unto our edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
nor consolation. For we are not <hi>meet</hi> nor able, by
the Power of any Light or Grace that we have received,
or can receive, to bear the immediate appearance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of them. His beloved Apostle <hi>John</hi> had
<hi>leaned on his bosom</hi> probably many a time in this life, in
the intimate familiarities of love: But when he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
appeared unto him in his Glory, he fell at <hi>his feet as
dead,</hi> Rev. 1. 17. And when he appeared unto <hi>Paul,</hi> all
the account he could give thereof, was, <hi>that he saw a light
from Heaven above the brightness of the Sun,</hi> whereon he and
all that were with him, <hi>fell to the ground,</hi> Act. 26. 13,
14.</p>
               <p>AND this was one Reason why in the days of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
here on earth, his Glory was vailed with the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of the flesh, and all sorts of sufferings, as we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
related. The Church in this life is no way meet, by
the Grace which it can be made partaker of, to converse
with him in the immediate manifestations of his Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:58587:78"/>
AND therefore those who dream of his <hi>Personal Reign</hi>
on the earth before the day of Judgment, unless they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that all the Saints shall be <hi>perfectly glorified</hi> also (which
is only to bring down Heaven to the Earth for a while, to
no purpose) provide not at all for the edification or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
of the Church. For no <hi>present grace</hi> advanced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the highest degree whereof in this World it is capable,
can make us meet for an immediate converse with Christ
in his unvailed Glory.</p>
               <p>How much more abominable is the folly of men, who
would represent the Lord Christ in his present Glory by
<hi>Pictures and Images</hi> of him? When they have done their
utmost with their burnished Glass and Guildings, an eye
of flesh cannot only behold it, but if it be guided by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
see it contemptible and foolish. But the true Glory
of Christ neither inward nor outward sight can bear the
rays of in this life.</p>
               <p>THE dispensation which we are meet for is only that
of his <hi>presence with us by his Spirit. We know him now no
more after the flesh,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 16. We are advanced above
that way and means of the knowledge of him by the <hi>fleshly
carnal Ordinances</hi> of the Old Testament. And we know
him not according unto that <hi>bodily presence</hi> of his, which
his Disciples enjoyed in the days of his flesh. We have
attained somewhat above that also. For such was the
nature of his Ministry here on earth, that there could not
be the promised dispensation of the spirit until that was fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
Therefore he tells his Disciples that <hi>it was expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for them that he should go away and send the spirit to them,</hi>
John. 16. 7. Hereon they had a clearer view of the Glory
of Christ, than they could have by beholding him in the
flesh. This is our spiritual posture and condition. We
are past the knowledge of him according to the flesh; we
cannot attain nor receive the <hi>sight</hi> of him in Glory; but
<hi>the life which we now lead, is by the Faith of the Son of
God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:58587:78"/>
I SHALL not here enquire into the nature of this <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
or the power and ability which we shall have in
Heaven to behold the Glory of Christ. Some few things
may be mentioned, as it relates unto our <hi>Minds</hi> and our
<hi>Bodies</hi> also after the Resurrection.</p>
               <p>1. FOR the Mind, it shall be perfectly freed from all
that Darkness, Unsteadiness, and other Incapacities, which
here it is accompanied with; and whereby it is weakened,
hindred and obstructed in the Exercise of Faith. And
they are of two sorts. First, such as are the remainders
of that depravation of our Natures, which came upon us
by sin. Hereby our Minds became wholly vain, dark,
and corrupt, as the Scripture testifieth, utterly unable to
discern spiritual things in a due manner. This is so far
cured and removed in this Life by Grace, as that those
<hi>who were darkness, do become light in the Lord,</hi> or are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to live unto God under the Conduct of a new spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Light communicated unto them. But it is so cured
and removed in <hi>part</hi> only, it is not perfectly abolished.
Hence are all our remaining Weaknesses and Incapacities
in discerning things spiritual and eternal, which we yet
groan under, and long for deliverance from. No Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps,
no Scars or Marks that ever it had place in our
Minds shall abide in glory, <hi>Ephes. 5. 27.</hi> Nothing shall
weaken, disturb, or incapacitate our Souls, in acting all
their Powers unimpeded by Vanity, Diversions, Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Inability, upon their proper Objects. The Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
hereof in universal Liberty and Power, we cannot
here comprehend: Nor can we yet conceive the Glory
and Beauty of those immixed spiritual actings of our
Minds, which shall have no <hi>Clog</hi> upon them, no Encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
in them, no Alloy of Dross accompanying of them.
One pure Act of spiritual Sight in discerning the Glory of
Christ, one pure Act of Love in cleaving unto God,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58587:79"/>
will bring in more Blessedness and Satisfaction into our
Minds, than in this World we are capable of.</p>
               <p>2. THERE is an <hi>Incapacity</hi> in our Minds, as unto
their Actings on things spiritual and eternal, that is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
natural from the Posture wherein they are, and the
<hi>Figure</hi> which they are to make in this Life. For they are
here <hi>cloathed with Flesh,</hi> and that debased and corrupted.
Now in this State, though the Mind act its Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by the Body as its <hi>Organ</hi> and Instrument: Yet is it
variously streightned, encumbred and impeded in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of its native Powers, especially towards things hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
by this Prison of the Flesh, wherein it is immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
There is an <hi>Angelical</hi> Excellency in the pure Actings
of the Soul, when delivered from all material Instruments
of them; or when they are all glorified and made suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
helps in its utmost spiritual Activity. How and by
what degrees our Minds shall be freed from these Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
in their beholding the glory of Christ, shall be
afterwards declared.</p>
               <p>2. AGAIN, a <hi>new light,</hi> the <hi>light of Glory</hi> shall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
in them. There is a Light in Nature, which is
the Power of a Man to discern the things of Man. An
Ability to know, perceive and judge of things natural.
It is that <hi>Spirit of a Man which is the Candle of the Lord,
searching all the inward parts of the belly,</hi> Prov. 20. 27.</p>
               <p>BUT by the light hereof no man can discern spiritual
things in a due manner, as the Apostle declares, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.
11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Wherefore God gives a supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,
a supernatural Light, the Light of Faith and
Grace, unto them whom he effectually calls unto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of himself by Jesus Christ. <hi>He shines into their
hearts to give them the knowledge of his Glory in the face
of his dear Son.</hi> Howbeit this new Light doth not abolish,
blot out, or render useless the other Light of Nature, as
the Sun when it riseth extinguisheth the Light of the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58587:79"/>
Stars: But it directs it, and rectifies it, as unto its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
object and end. Yet is it in its self, a Light quite of
another Nature. But he who hath only the former Light,
can understand nothing of it, because he hath no Taste
or Experience of its Power and Operations. He may talk
of it, and make Enquiries about it, but he knows it not.</p>
               <p>NOW we have received this <hi>Light of Faith</hi> and
Grace, whereby we discern spiritual things, and behold
the glory of Christ in the Imperfect manner before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.
But in Heaven there shall be a superadded <hi>light
of Glory,</hi> which shall make the Mind it self <hi>shine as the
Firmament,</hi> Dan. 12. 3. I shall only say three things of
it. (1.) That as the <hi>Light of Grace</hi> doth not destroy or
abolish the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> but rectifie and improve it;
so the <hi>Light of Glory</hi> shall not abolish or destroy the <hi>Light
of Faith and Grace,</hi> but by incorporating with it, render
it absolutely perfect. (2.) That as by the <hi>Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
we cannot clearly comprehend the true Nature and
Efficacy of the <hi>Light of Grace,</hi> because it is of another
Kind, and is seen only in its own Light; so by the <hi>Light
of Grace</hi> we cannot absolutely comprehend this <hi>Light of
Glory,</hi> being of a peculiar Kind and Nature, seen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
only by its own Light. <hi>It doth not appear what we
shall be.</hi> (3.) That this is the best Notion we can have
of this <hi>Light of Glory,</hi> that in the first Instance of its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
it <hi>perfectly transforms the Soul into the Image and Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS is the <hi>progress of our nature</hi> unto its Rest and
Blessedness. The principles remaining in it concerning
<hi>Good and Evil,</hi> with its practical convictions, are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
but improved by grace; as its blindness, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and enmity to God, are in part taken away. Being
renewed by Grace, what it receives here of spiritual Life
and Light, shall never be destroyed but be perfected in
Glory. Grace renews Nature; Glory perfects Grace;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:58587:80"/>
and so the whole Soul is brought unto its rest in God.
We have an Image of it in the <hi>blind Man</hi> whom our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
cured, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 22, 23, 24. He was absolutely blind,
born so, no doubt. Upon the first touch his Eyes were
opened, and he saw but very obscurely; <hi>he saw men walking
like Trees.</hi> But on the second he saw all things clearly. Our
minds in themselves are absolutely blind. The first visitation
of them by Grace, gives them a sight of things spiritual,
heavenly and eternal, but it is obscure and unsteady.
The <hi>sight of Glory</hi> makes all things clear and evident.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly;</hi> THE body as glorified, with its senses, shall
have its use and place herein. After we are cloathed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
with our flesh, we shall <hi>see our Redeemer with our Eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We know not here what power and spirituality there
will be in the acts of our glorified Bodies. Such they will
be, as shall bear a part in eternal Blessedness. Holy <hi>Stephen,</hi>
the first Martyr, took up somewhat of Glory by <hi>Antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation</hi>
before he died. For when he was brought to his
Tryal before the <hi>Council,</hi> all that sate therein <hi>looking stedfastly
on him, saw his face as the face of an Angel, Act.</hi> 6. 15. He
had his <hi>Transfiguration,</hi> according unto his measure, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
unto that of our Blessed Saviour in the Mount.
And by this initial Beam of Glory, he received such a
piercing vivacity and edge on his <hi>bodily eyes,</hi> that through
all those inconceivable distances between the earth and
the residence of the Blessed, he looked stedfastly into
Heaven, and <hi>saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the
right hand of God,</hi> Act. 7. 55, 56. Who then can declare
what will be the power and acting of this sense of <hi>sight</hi>
when perfectly glorified; or what sweetness and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may be admitted into our Souls thereby?</p>
               <p>IT was a priviledge (who would not have longed to
partake of it?) to have seen him with our bodily eyes in
the days of his flesh, as did the Apostles and other his
Disciples. Howbeit he was not <hi>then glorified</hi> himself in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58587:80"/>
the manifestation of his Glory; nor they who saw him,
in the change or transformation of their nature. How
great this privilenge was, himself declares unto those that
so saw him, <hi>Mat. 13. 17. Verily I say unto you, that many
Prophets and righteous Men have desired to see those things which
ye see;</hi> whereunto we shall speak immediately. And if this
were so excellent a priviledge, as that we cannot but
congratulate them by whom it was enjoyed, how excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
how glorious will it be, when with these eyes of
ours, gloriously purified and strengthned beyond those of
<hi>Stephen,</hi> we shall behold Christ himself immediately in
the fulness of his Glory! He alone perfectly understands
the greatness and excellency hereof, who prayed his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that those who <hi>believe in him, may be where he is, so
to behold his Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THESE are some of the grounds of this first <hi>difference</hi>
between our beholding the Glory of Christ by <hi>Faith</hi> here,
and by immediate Vision hereafter. Hence the one is
weak, imperfect, obscure, reflexive; the other direct,
immediate, eaven and constant; and we may stay a little
in the contemplation of these things.</p>
               <p>THIS view of the <hi>Glory of Christ</hi> which we have now
spoken unto, is that which we are breathing and <hi>panting</hi>
after; that which the Lord Christ prays that we may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
unto; that which the Apostle testifies to be <hi>our best;</hi>
the best thing, or state, which our nature is capable of, that
which brings eternal rest and satisfaction unto our Souls.</p>
               <p>HERE our Souls are burthened with innumerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
and our Faith is clogged in its Operations by
Ignorance and Darkness. This makes our best estate and
highest attainments to be accompanied with <hi>groans</hi> for
deliverance. <hi>We which have received the first fruits of the
spirit, even we our selves groan withing our selves, waiting for
the Adoption, even the redemption of the body,</hi> Rom. 8. 23.
Yea, whilst we are in this Tabernacle, we <hi>groan earnestly</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:58587:81"/>
as being burthened, because we are not <hi>absent from the
body, and present with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 2, 4, 8. The
more we grow in Faith, and Spiritual Light, the more
sensible are we of our present burthens, and the more
vehemently do we <hi>groan</hi> for deliverance into the <hi>perfect
liberty of the Sons of God.</hi> This is the posture of their
minds who have received the <hi>first fruits of the Spirit,</hi> in
the most eminent degree. The nearer any one is to
Heaven, the more earnestly he desires to be there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ is there. For the more frequent and steady
are our views of him by faith, the more do we long and
groan for the removal of all obstructions and interpositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in our so doing. Now groaning is a vehement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
mixed with sorrow, for the present want of what is
desired. The desire hath sorrow, and that sorrow hath
joy and refreshment in it; like a shower that falls on a
Man in a Garden in the Spring; it wets him, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
refresheth him with the Savor it causeth in the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Herbs of the Garden, where he is. And this
<hi>groaning,</hi> which when it is constant and habitual, is one
of the choicest effects of Faith in this life, respects what
we would be <hi>delivered from,</hi> and what we would <hi>attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi>
The <hi>first</hi> is expressed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. The <hi>other</hi> in the
places now mentioned. And this frame with an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture
of some sighs from weariness by the troubles, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
pains, sicknesses of this life, is the best we can
here attain unto.</p>
               <p>ALAS! we cannot here <hi>think of Christ,</hi> but we are
quickly ashamed of, and troubled at our own thoughts:
So confused are they, so unsteady, so imperfect. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
they issue in a groan or a sigh; <hi>Oh when shall we
come unto him? when shall we be ever with him? when shall
we see him as he is?</hi> And if at any time he begins to give
more than ordinary evidences and intimations of his
Glory and Love unto our Souls, we are not able to bear
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:58587:81"/>
them, so as to give them any abiding residence in our
Minds. But ordinarily, this trouble and groaning is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
our best attainments in this World, a trouble
which, I pray God, I may never be delivered from, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
deliverance do come at once from this state of morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
Yea the good Lord encrease this trouble more and
more in all that believe.</p>
               <p>THE heart of a believer affected with the Glory of
Christ, is like the <hi>Needle</hi> touched with the <hi>Loadstone.</hi> It
can no longer be quiet, no longer be satisfied in a distance
from him. It is put into a continual motion towards him.
The motion indeed is <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>tremulous.</hi> Pantings,
breathings, sighings, groanings, in prayer, in meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in the secret recesses of our Minds, are the life of
it. However it is continually pressing towards him. But
it obtains not its <hi>point,</hi> it comes not to its center and rest
in this World.</p>
               <p>BUT now <hi>above,</hi> all things are clear and serene; all
plain and evident in our beholding the Glory of Christ;
we shall be <hi>ever with him,</hi> and <hi>see him as he is.</hi> This is
Heaven, this is Blessedness, this is Eternal Rest.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Person of Christ</hi> in all his Glory shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
before us; and the eyes of our understandings
shall be so gloriously illuminated, as that we shall be able
steadily to behold and comprehend that Glory.</p>
               <p>BUT alas! here at present our Minds <hi>recoil,</hi> our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
fail, our Hearts are overcome, our Thoughts
confused, and our Eyes turn aside from the Lustre of this
Glory; nor can we abide in the Contemplation of it. But
there, an immediate, constant view of it, will bring in
everlasting refreshment and joy unto our whole Souls.</p>
               <p>THIS <hi>beholding of the Glory of Christ given him by his
Father,</hi> is indeed subordinate unto the ultimate vision of
the essence of God. What that is we cannot well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;
only we know that <hi>the pure in heart shall see God.</hi>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:58587:82"/>
But it hath such an immediate connexion with it, and
subordination unto it, as that without it we can never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the face of God, as the objective blessedness of our
Souls. For he is and shall be to eternity, the only means
of Communication between God and the Church.</p>
               <p>AND we may take some Direction in our looking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
and longing after this <hi>perfect view</hi> of the Glory of Christ,
from the example of the Saints under the Old Testament.
The sight which they had of the Glory of Christ, for
<hi>they</hi> also <hi>saw his Glory</hi> through the obscurity of its Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and its being vailed with <hi>types and shadows,</hi> was
weak and imperfect in the most illuminated believers,
much inferior unto what we now have by faith, through
the Gospel. Yet such it was, as encouraged them to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
and search diligently into what was revealed,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.
10, 11. Howbeit their discoveries were but dark and
confused, such as Men have of things at a great distance,
or <hi>in a Land that is very far off,</hi> as the Prophet speaks, <hi>Isa.</hi>
33. 16. And the continuance of this Vail on the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Glory of Christ, whilst a Vail of Ignorance
and Blindness was upon their Hearts and Minds, proved
the ruin of that Church in its Apostacy, as the Apostle
declares, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7, 13, 14. This <hi>double vail</hi> (the <hi>covering
covered,</hi> the <hi>vail vailed</hi>) God promised to take away, <hi>Isa.</hi>
25. 7. And then shall they turn to the Lord, when they
shall be able clearly to behold the Glory of Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
3. 16.</p>
               <p>BUT this caused them who were real Believers among
them, to desire, long, and pray for the removal of these
Vails, the Departure of those shadows, which made it as
Night unto them in comparison of what they knew would
appear, when the <hi>Sun of Righteousness should arise with heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his Wings.</hi> They thought it long ere <hi>the day did
break, and the shadows flee away, Cant.</hi> 2. 17. Chap. 4. 6.

8. 19. A thrusting <hi>forth of the head</hi> with desire and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of the exhibition of the Son of God in the
flesh, and the accomplishment of all divine promises
therein. Hence he was called <hi>the Lord whom they sought
and delighted in,</hi> Mal. 3. 1.</p>
               <p>AND great was the spiritual Wisdom of believers in
those days. They rejoyced and gloried in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of Divine Worship which they did enjoy. They
looked on them as their chiefest priviledge, and attended
unto them with diligence, as an effect of Divine Wisdom
and Love, as also because they had a <hi>shadow of good things
to come.</hi> But yet at the same time they longed and desired
that the <hi>time of Reformation were come,</hi> wherein they should
all be removed; that so they might behold and enjoy the
good things signified by them. And those who did not so,
but rested in, and trusted unto their present Institutions,
were not accepted with God. Those who were really il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated
did not so, but lived in constant desires after the
revelation of the whole Mystery of the Wisdom of God
in Christ, as did the Angels themselves, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 3. Ephes.</hi>
3. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>IN this frame of heart and suitable actings of their
Souls, there was more of the <hi>power</hi> of true faith and
love than is found among the most at this day. They
saw the promises afar o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, and were <hi>perswaded of them, and
imbraced them,</hi> Heb. 11. 13. They reached out the
arms of their most intent Affections, to embrace the
Things that were promised. We have an instance of
this frame in Old <hi>Simeon,</hi> who so soon as he had taken
the Child Jesus in his Arms, cryed out, <hi>Now Lord, let me
depart,</hi> now let me dye, this is that which my Soul hath
longed for, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 28, 29.</p>
               <p>OUR present darkness and weakness in beholding the
Glory of Christ, is not like theirs. It is not occasioned
by a <hi>vail of Types and Shadows</hi> cast on it by the Represen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58587:83"/>
Institutions of it; It doth not arise from the want of
a clear <hi>Doctrinal Revelation</hi> of the Person and Office of
Christ; But as was before declared, it proceedeth from
two other Causes. First from the <hi>nature of Faith</hi> it self
in comparison of Vision. It is not able to look directly
into this <hi>excellent Glory,</hi> nor fully to comprehend it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
from the <hi>way of its proposal,</hi> which is not <hi>substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
of the thing it self, but only of an Image of it, as
in a Glass. But the light, the view of the Glory of Christ,
which we shall have in Heaven, is much more above that
which we now enjoy by the Gospel, than what we do, or
may so enjoy, is above what they have attained under their
Types and Shadows. There is a far greater distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Vision of Heaven, and the sight which we
have now by faith, than is between the sight which we
now have, and what they had under the Old Testament.
Heaven doth more excell the Gospel-State, than that
State doth the Law. Wherefore, if they did so pray, so
long for, so desire the removal of their Shadows and Vails,
that they might see what we now see, that they might so
behold the Glory of Christ, as we may behold it in the
Light of the Gospel; how much more should we, if we
have the same Faith with them, the same Love (which
neither will nor can be satisfied without perfect fruition)
long and pray for the removal of all Weakness, of all
Darkness and In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erposition, that we may come unto that
immediate beholding of his Glory, which he so earnestly
prayed, that we might be brought unto.</p>
               <p>To sum up briefly what hath been spoken. There are
three things to be considered concerning the Glory of
Christ, three degrees in its manifestation; The <hi>Shadow,</hi> the
<hi>perfect Image,</hi> and the <hi>Substance</hi> it self. Those under the
Law had only the <hi>shadow</hi> of it, and of the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
unto it, they had not the <hi>perfect Image</hi> of them, <hi>Heb.</hi>
10. 1. Under the Gospel we have the <hi>perfect Image,</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:58587:83"/>
which they had not; or a clear compleat revelation and
declaration of it presenting it unto us as in a <hi>glass:</hi> But
the enjoyment of these things in their <hi>Substance</hi> is refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for Heaven; we must be <hi>where he is,</hi> that we may
behold his Glory. Now there is a greater difference and
distance between the real substance of any thing, and
the most perfect image of it, than there is between the
most perfect image, and the lowest shadow of the same
thing. If then they longed to be freed from their state
of Types and Shadows, to enjoy the Representation of
the Glory of Christ in that Image of it, which is given
us in the Gospel; much more ought we to breath and
pant after our deliverance from beholding it in the <hi>Image</hi>
of it, that we may enjoy the <hi>Substance</hi> it self. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
can be manifest of Christ on this side Heaven, it is
granted unto us for this end, that we may the more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently
desire to be present with him.</p>
               <p>AND as it was their Wisdom and their Grace to <hi>rejoyce</hi>
in the Light they had, and in those <hi>typical Administrations</hi>
of Divine Worship which shadowed out the Glory of
Christ unto them, yet did always pant after that more
excellent Light and full Discovery of it, which was to be
made by the Gospel; So it will be ours also, thankfully
to use and improve the <hi>Revelations</hi> which we enjoy of it,
and those <hi>Institutions of Worship,</hi> wherein our Faith is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in the view thereof; yet so as continually to breath
after that perfect, that glorifying <hi>sight</hi> of it, which is
reserved for Heaven above.</p>
               <p>AND may we not a little examine our selves by these
things? Do we esteem this <hi>pressing towards the perfect view
of the Glory of Christ</hi> to be our Duty, and do we abide in
the performance of it? If it be otherwise with any of
us, it is a signal evidence that our Profession is <hi>Hypocritical.</hi>
If Christ be in us, he is the hope of Glory in us; and
where that hope is, it will be active in desires of the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58587:84"/>
things hoped for. Many love the World to well, and
have their minds too much filled with the things of it,
to entertain desires of <hi>speeding through</hi> it unto a state where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they may behold the Glory of Christ. They are at
home, and are unwilling to be absent from the body,
tho to be present with the Lord. They hope it may be
that such a season will come at one time or another, and
then it will be the best they can look for when they can
be here no more. But they have but a little sight of
the Glory of Christ in this World by Faith, if any at
all, who so little, so faintly desire to have the <hi>immediate
sight</hi> of it above. I cannot understand how any Man
can walk with God as he ought, or hath that Love for
Jesus Christ which true Faith will produce, or doth place
his Refreshments and Joy in spiritual things, in things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
that doth not on all just occasions, so meditate on
the Glory of Christ in Heaven as to <hi>long for an admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
into the immediate</hi> sight of it.</p>
               <p>OUR Lord Jesus Christ alone perfectly understood
wherein the Eternal Blessedness of them that believe in
him, doth consist. And this is the sum of what he prays
for with respect unto that end; namely, <hi>that we may be
where he is to behold his Glory.</hi> And is it not our Duty to
live in a continual <hi>desire of that</hi> which he prayed so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
that we might attain? If in our selves, we as yet
apprehend but little of the Glory, the Excellency, the
Blessedness of it, yet ought we to repose that confidence
in the Wisdom and Love of Christ, that it is our best,
infinitely better than any thing we can enjoy here below.</p>
               <p>UNTO those who are inured unto those <hi>Contemplations,</hi>
they are the salt of their Lives, whereby every thing is
condited and made savory unto them, as we shall shew
afterwards. And the want of spiritual diligence herein,
is that which hath brought forth a negligent, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
wordy profession of Religion, which countenancing
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:58587:84"/>
it self with some outward Duties, hath lost out of it, the
power of Faith and Love in their principal Operations.
Hereby many deceive their own Souls, Goods, Lands,
Possessions, Relations, Trades, with secular Interests in
them, are the things whose Image is drawn on their
Minds, and whose <hi>Characters</hi> are written on their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
as the Titles whereby they may be known. As
believers beholding the Glory of Christ in the blessed Glass
of the Gospel, are changed into the same Image and
Likeness by the Spirit of the Lord; so these Persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
the Beauty of the World, and the Things that
are in it, in the cursed Glass of Self-love, they are in their
minds changed into the same Image. Hence perplexing
Fears, vain Hopes, empty Embraces of perishing things,
fruitless desires, earthly, carnal designs, cursed, self-pleasing
Imaginations, feeding on and being fed by the Love of
the World and self, do abide and prevail in them. But
we have not so learned Christ Jesus.</p>

               <head type="sub">The second Difference between our beholding
the Glory of Christ by Faith in this World,
and by Sight in Heaven.</head>
               <p>FAITH is the Light wherein we behold the <hi>Glory of
Christ in this World.</hi> And this in its own Nature, as
unto this great End, is weak and imperfect, like weak
Eyes, that cannot behold the Sun in its Beauty. Hence our
sight of it differs greatly from what we shall enjoy in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:58587:85"/>
Glory, as hath been declared. But this is not all; it is
frequently <hi>hindred</hi> and <hi>interrupted</hi> in its Operations,
or it loseth the view of its object by one means or other.
As he who sees any thing at a great distance, sees it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly;
and the least interposition or motion takes it
quite out of his sight. So is it with our Faith in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
whence sometimes we can have little, sometimes no
sight at all of the Glory of Christ by it. And this gives
us, as we shall see, another <hi>Difference</hi> between <hi>Faith</hi> and
<hi>Sight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOW although the consideration hereof may seem
a kind of <hi>Diversion</hi> from our present Argument, yet I
choose to insist upon it, that I may evidence the Reasons
whence it is that many have so little <hi>experience</hi> of the
things whereof we have treated, that they find so
little of <hi>Reallity</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> in the exercise of this Grace,
or the performance of this Duty. For it will appear in
the issue, that the whole defect is in themselves; the truth
it self insisted on, is great and efficacious.</p>
               <p>1. WHILST we are in this life, the Lord Christ is
pleased in his <hi>Sovereign Wisdom</hi> sometimes to withdraw,
and as it were, to hide himself from us. Then do our
Minds fall into Clouds and Darkness; Faith is at a loss,
we cannot behold his Glory; yea, we may seek him,
but cannot find him. So <hi>Job</hi> complains as we observed
before. <hi>Behold, I go forward, but he is not there, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
but I cannot perceive him: on the left hand where he
doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the
right hand, that I cannot see him.</hi> Chap. 23. 8, 9. Which
way soever I turn my self, whatever are my endeavours,
in what way or work of his own, I seek him, I cannot
find him, I cannot see him, I cannot behold his Glory.
So the Church also complains; <hi>Verily thou art a God that
hidest thy self, O God of Israel the Saviour,</hi> Isa. 45. 15.
And the <hi>Psalmist, How long Lord wilt thou hide thy self for
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58587:85"/>
ever?</hi> Psal. 89. 46. This hiding of the face of God, is
the hiding of the shining of his Glory in the face of
Christ Jesus, and therefore of the Glory of Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
for it is the Glory of Christ to be the Representative
of the Glory of God. The <hi>Spouse</hi> in the <hi>Canticles</hi> is often
at a loss and herein, bemoans her self that her Beloved was
withdrawn, that she could neither find him, nor see him,
Chap. 3. 1, 2. Chap. 5. 6.</p>
               <p>MEN may retain their Notions concerning Christ,
his Person, and his Glory. These cannot be blotted out
of their Minds, but by <hi>Heresie</hi> or <hi>obdurate Stupidity.</hi> They
may have the same <hi>Doctrinal Knowledge</hi> of him with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
but the sight of his Glory doth not consist there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
They may abide in the outward performance of
Duties towards him, as formerly; but yet all this while as
unto the especial gracious Communications of himself
unto their Souls, and as unto a chearful refreshing view
of his Glory, He may withdraw and hide himself from
them.</p>
               <p>AS under the same outward dispensations of the word,
he doth manifest himself unto some, and not unto
others; (<hi>How is it that thou wilt manifest thy self unto us,
and not unto the world?</hi> Joh. 14. 22.) Whereon they
to whom he doth so mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>est himself, do see him to be
beautiful, glorious, and lovely (for <hi>unto them that believe,
he is precious</hi>) whilst the others see nothing hereof, but
wonder at them, by whom he is admired, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 9. So
in the same dispensation of the word, he sometimes hides
his face, turns away the Light of his countenance, clouds
the beams of his Glory unto some, whilst others are
cherished and warmed with them.</p>
               <p>TWO Things we must here speak unto.</p>
               <p>1. WHY doth the Lord Christ at any time thus hide himself
in his Glory from the Faith of Believers that they cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:58587:86"/>
2. <hi>HOW we may perceive and know that he doth so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
himself from us, so that however we may please our selves,
we do not indeed behold his Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS unto the first of these, tho what he doth is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
an act of Sovereign <hi>unaccountable Wisdom,</hi> yet there
are many holy ends of it, and consequently reasons for
it. I shall mention one only. He doth it to <hi>stir us up in
an eminent manner unto a diligent search and enquiry after him.</hi>
Woful sloth and negligence are apt to prevail in us, in
our Meditations on heavenly things. <hi>Tho our hearts wake</hi>
(as the Spouse speaks, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 2.) in a valuation of Christ,
his Love, and his Grace, <hi>yet we sleep,</hi> as unto the due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Faith and Love towards him. Who is it that
can justifie himself herein? That can say, <hi>My heart is pure,
I am clean from this sin?</hi> Yea it is so far otherwise with
many of us, that he is for ever to be admired in his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
that on the account of our unkindness and woful
negligence herein, he hath not only withdrawn himself
at seasons, but that he hath not utterly departed from us.
Now he knows that those with whom he hath been gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
present, who have had views of his Glory, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho
they have not valued the mercy and priviledge of it,
as they ought, yet can they not bear a sense of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and his hiding himself from them. By this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will he awake them unto a diligent enquiry after him.
Upon the discovery of his absence and such a distance of
his Glory from them as their Faith cannot reach unto it,
they become <hi>like the Doves of the Valleys all of them mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every one for his iniquity,</hi> and do stir up themselves to
seek him early and with diligence, see <hi>Hos.</hi> 5. 5. So
wherever the <hi>Spouse</hi> intimates this <hi>withdrawing of Christ
from her,</hi> she immediately gives an account of her restless
diligence and endeavours in her enquiries after him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
she have found him, <hi>Chap. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Chap.</hi> 5.
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And in these enquiries there is such
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58587:86"/>
an exercise of Faith and Love, tho it may be acting
themselves mostly in sighs and groans, as is acceptable and
well pleasing to him.</p>
               <p>WE are like him in the Parable of the Prophet that spake
unto <hi>Ahab,</hi> who having one committed unto him to keep,
affirms that <hi>whilst he was busie here and there, he was gone.</hi>
Christ commits himself unto us, and we ought carefully
to keep his presence; <hi>I held him,</hi> saith the Church, and
<hi>would not let him go,</hi> Cant. 3. 4. But whilst we are busy
here and there, while our Minds are over filled with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, he withdraws himself, we cannot find him.
But even this rebuke is a sanctified ordinance for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
and his Return unto us.</p>
               <p>2. Our second enquiry is, <hi>How we may know when Christ
doth so withdraw himself from us, that we do not, that we
cannot behold his Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I SPEAK herein unto them alone who make the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the lively actings of Faith and Love in and
towards Jesus Christ their chiefest concern in all their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements,
yea in their whole walk before God, Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these, our enquiry is, how they may know when
Christ doth in any degree or measure <hi>withdraw</hi> from
them so as that they cannot in a due manner behold his Glory?</p>
               <p>AND the first discovery hereof is by the <hi>consequents</hi>
of such withdrawings. And what are the <hi>consequents</hi> of
it, we can know no otherwise but by the effects of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
with us, and the manifestation of himself unto us,
which as unto some degrees must necessarily cease there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>NOW the first of these is the <hi>Life, Vigor and effectual
Acting of all Grace in us.</hi> This is an inseparable conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and effect of a view of his Glory. Whilst we
enjoy it, <hi>we live; nevertheless not we, but Christ liveth in us,</hi>
exciting and acting all his Graces in us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:58587:87"/>
THIS is that which the Apostle instructeth us in:
while we <hi>behold his Glory, as in a Glass, we are transformed
into the same Image from Glory to Glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. That
is, whilst by faith we contemplate on the Glory of Christ
as revealed in the Gospel, all Grace will thrive and flourish
in us towards a perfect Conformity unto him. For whilst
we abide in this View and Contemplation, our Souls
will be preserved in holy Frames, and in a continual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Love and Delight, with all other spiritual Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
towards him. It is impossible whilst Christ is in
the eye of our Faith as proposed in the Gospel, but that
we shall labour to be like him and greatly love him. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there any way for us to attain unto either of these
which are the great concernments of our Souls, namely
to be <hi>like</hi> unto Christ and to <hi>love</hi> him, but by a constant
view of him and his Glory by faith which powerfully and
effectually works them in us. All the <hi>Doctrinal Knowledge</hi>
which we have of him is useless; all the view we have of
his Glory is but Fancy, Imagination or Superstition, which
are not accompanied with this <hi>transforming Power.</hi> And
that which is wrought by it, is the encrease and vigor of
all Grace; for therein alone our Conformity unto him
doth consist. Growth in Grace, Holiness and Obedience,
is a <hi>growing like unto Christ,</hi> and nothing else is so.</p>
               <p>I cannot refrain here from a necessary short <hi>Digression.</hi>
This <hi>transforming efficacy</hi> from a spiritual View of Christ
as proposed in the Gospel, being lost as unto an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of it in the Minds of Men carnal and ignorant
of the mystery of believing (as it is at present by many
derided, tho it be the life of Religion) <hi>Fancy</hi> and <hi>Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
provided various supplies in the room of it. For
they found out <hi>Crucifixes</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> with <hi>Faintings</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
him in his Sufferings and Glory. By these things,
their carnal Affections being excited by their outward
Senses, they suppose themselves to be affected with him,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58587:87"/>
and to be like unto him. Yea, some have proceeded so
far, as either by <hi>Arts Diabolical,</hi> or by other means, to
make an appearance of <hi>wounds on their hands, and feet,</hi> and
<hi>sides,</hi> therein pretending to be like him; yea, to be wholly
transformed into his <hi>Image.</hi> But that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by an Image, is but an Image, an imaginary Christ
will effect nothing in the Minds of Men, but imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Grace.</p>
               <p>THUS Religion was lost and died. When Men
could not obtain any <hi>experience</hi> in their Minds of the
spiritual Mysteries of the Gospel, nor be sensible of any
spiritual Change or Advantage by them, they substituted
some outward Duties and Observances in their stead; as
I shall shew (God willing) elsewhere more at large. These
produced some kind of effects on their Minds and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
but quite of another nature than those which
are the real effects of true <hi>Evangelical</hi> Grace. This is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
evident in this substitution of <hi>Images</hi> instead of the
representation of Christ and his Glory made in the
Gospel.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER there is a general Supposition granted
on all hands; namely, that there must be a <hi>View of Christ,</hi>
and <hi>his Glory,</hi> to cause us to love him, and thereby to
make us conformable or like unto him. But here lies the
difference; those of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> say that this
must be done by the beholding of <hi>Crucifixes</hi> with other
Images and Pictures of him; and that with our bodily
eyes: We say it is, by our beholding his Glory by Faith,
as revealed in the Gospel, and no otherwise. And to
confess the Truth, we have some, who as they reject the
<hi>use of Images,</hi> so they despise that spiritual View of the
Glory of Christ which we enquire after. Such Persons
on the first occasion will fall on the other side; For any
thing is better than nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:58587:88"/>
BUT as we have a sure word of Prophesie to secure
us from these abominations by an express prohibition of
such Images unto all ends whatever; so unto our stability
in the profession of the Truth, and <hi>experience</hi> of the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of this Spiritual View of Christ <hi>transforming</hi> our
Souls into his own likeness, is absolutely necessary. For
if an <hi>Idolater</hi> should plead, as they do all, that in the
beholding of the <hi>Image of Christ,</hi> or of a <hi>Crucifix,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if they are sedulous and constant therein, they find
their Affections unto him greatly excited, increased, and
inflamed (as they will be, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 5.) and that hereon he
endeavours to be like unto him, what shall we have to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
thereunto? For it is certain that such <hi>Images</hi> are apt to
make impressions on the Minds of Men; partly from the
readiness of the senses and imagination to give them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
into their thoughts; and partly from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
inclinations unto superstition, their aversation from
things spiritual and invisible, with an inclination unto
things present and visible. Hence among them who are
satisfied that they ought not to be adored with any <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Veneration,</hi> yet some are apt upon the sight of them
to entertain a <hi>thoughtful Reverence,</hi> as they would do if
they were to enter into a <hi>Pagan Temple</hi> full of Idols; and
others are continually making approaches towards their
use and veneration in <hi>Paintings and Altars</hi> and such out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
postures of Worship as are used in the Religious
Service of them. But that they do sensibly affect the
Minds of Men carnal and superstitious, cannot be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and as they suppose, it is a love unto Christ himself.
However, certain it is in general, and confessed on all
hands, that the <hi>beholding of Christ</hi> is the most blessed
means of exciting all our Graces, spiritualizing all our
Affections, and transforming our Minds into his likeness.
And if we have not another, and that a more excellent
way of <hi>beholding him,</hi> than they have who behold him,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:58587:88"/>
as they suppose, in Images and Crucifixes, they would
seem to have the advantage of us. For their Minds
will really be affected with somewhat, ours with nothing
at all. And by the pretence thereof, they inveagle the carnal
affections of Men ignorant of the Power of the Gospel,
to become their <hi>Proselytes.</hi> For having lived, it may be,
a long time without any the least experience of a sensible
impression on their Minds, or a transforming power
from the Representation of Christ in the Gospel, upon
their very first Religious, Devout, Application unto these
Images, they find their Thoughts exercised, their Minds
affected, and some present change made upon them.</p>
               <p>BUT there was a difference between the <hi>Person of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
and an <hi>Image with a bolster of Goats Hair,</hi> though the
one were laid in the room and place of the other. And
there is so between Christ and an Image, though the one
be put into the place of the other. Neither do these things
serve unto any other end, but to divert the Minds of Men
from Faith and Love to Christ; giving them some such
satisfactions in the room of them, as that their carnal
Affections do cleave unto their Idols. And indeed it doth
belong unto the Wisdom of Faith, or we stand in need
of spiritual Light, to discern and judge between the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of natural Affections towards spiritual Objects, on
undue motives, by undue means, with indirect ends,
wherein all <hi>Papal Devotion</hi> consists, and the spiritual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Grace in those Affections duely fixed on spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Objects.</p>
               <p>BUT as was said, it is a real experience of the <hi>Efficacy,</hi>
that there is in the spiritual <hi>beholding of the Glory of Christ
by Faith</hi> as proposed in the Gospel, to strengthen, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
and excite all Grace unto its proper exercise, so
changing and transforming the Soul gradually into his
likeness, which must secure us against all those Pretences;
and so I return from this <hi>Digression.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:58587:89"/>
HEREBY we may understand whether the Lord
Christ doth so <hi>withdraw himself,</hi> as that we do not, as that
we cannot behold his glory by Faith in a due manner,
which is the thing enquired after. For if we grow <hi>weak
in our Graces,</hi> unspiritual in our Frames, cold in our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
or negligent in the exercise of them by holy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,
it is evident that he is at a great distance from us,
so as that we do not <hi>behold his Glory</hi> as we ought. If the
weather grow cold, Herbs and Plants do whither, and
the Frost begins to bind up the earth, all men grant that
the <hi>Sim</hi> is withdrawn, and makes not its wonted approach
unto us. And if it be so with our Hearts, that they grow
<hi>cold, frozen, withering, lifeless</hi> in and unto spiritual Duties,
it is certain that the Lord Christ is in some sence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn,
and that we do not behold his Glory. We retain
<hi>Notions</hi> of Truth concerning his Person, Office and Grace;
but faith is not in constant exercise, as to real views of
him and his Glory. For there is nothing more certain in
Christian Experience than this is, that while we do really
by Faith behold the Glory of Christ, as proposed in the
Gospel, the Glory of his Person and Office as before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
and so abide in Holy Thoughts and Meditations
thereof, especially in our private Duties and Retirements,
<hi>all Grace</hi> will live and thrive in us in some measure, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
love unto his Person, and therein unto all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
unto him. Let us but put it to the trial, and we
shall infallibly find the promised event.</p>
               <p>DO any of us find <hi>decays in Grace</hi> prevailing in us;
deadness, coldness, lukewarmness, a kind of Spiritual
Stupidity and senseless coming upon us? Do we find an
unreadiness unto the exercise of Grace in its proper sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the vigorous actings of it in Duties of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with God? And would we have our souls recovered
from these dangerous diseases? Let us assure our selves
there is <hi>no better</hi> way for our healing and deliverance, yea
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:58587:89"/>
                  <hi>no other</hi> way but this alone, namely the <hi>obtaining a fresh view
of the Glory of Christ by faith, and a steady abiding therein.</hi>
Constant contemplation of Christ and his Glory putting
forth its transforming power unto the revival of all Grace,
is the only relief in this case, as shall further be shewed
afterwards.</p>
               <p>SOME will say, that this must be effected by <hi>fresh sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
and renewed communications of the Holy Spirit.</hi> Unless
he fall as dew and showers on our dry and barren hearts,
unless he causeth our Graces to spring, thrive and bring
forth fruit, unless he revive and increase faith, love and
holiness in our souls, our <hi>backs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>idings</hi> will not be healed,
nor our spiritual state be recovered. Unto this end is he
prayed for, and promised in the Scripture, see <hi>Cant</hi> 4. 1. 6.
<hi>Isa. 44. 3, 4. Ezek. 11. 19. chap. 36. 26. Hos.</hi> 14. 5, 6.
And so it is. The immediate efficiency of the revival of
our souls, is from and by the Holy Spirit. But the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
is, in <hi>what way,</hi> or by <hi>what means,</hi> we may obtain
the supplies and communications of him unto this end?
This the Apostle declares in the place insisted on; <hi>We
beholding the Glory of Christ in a Glass, are changed into the
same image from glory to glory, even by the spirit of the Lord.</hi>
It is in the exercise of Faith on Christ in the way before
described, that the Holy Spirit puts forth his renewing,
transforming Power in and upon our souls. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is that alone which will retrive Christians from their
present decays and deadness.</p>
               <p>SOME <hi>complain</hi> greatly of their State and Condition;
none so dead, so dull and stupid as they. They know
not whether they have any spark of heavenly life left in
them; some make weak and faint endeavours for a reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
which are like the attempts of a man in a dream
wherein he seems to use great endeavours without any
success. Some put themselves unto multiplied duties.
Howbeit the <hi>Generallity of Prifessors</hi> seem to be in a pining
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:58587:90"/>
thriftless condition. And the reason of it is, because they
will not sincerely and constantly make use of the only
remedy and relief; like a man that will rather chuse to
pine away in his sickness, with some useless, transient
refreshments, than apply himself unto a known and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
remedy, because it may be the use of it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suited
unto some of his present occasions. Now this is
to live in the exercise of Faith in Christ Jesus: This
himself assures us of, Joh. 15. 4, 5. <hi>Abide in me, and I
in you; As the branch cannot bear fruit of it self except it abide
in the vine, no more can ye except you abide in me, I am
the vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in me, and I
in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye
can do nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THERE is a twofold <hi>coming unto Christ</hi> by believing.
The first is that <hi>we may have life;</hi> that is, a spring and
principle of spiritual life communicated unto us from him,
<hi>for he is our life,</hi> Col. 3. 3. and <hi>because he liveth, we live
also,</hi> Joh. 14. 19. Yea, it is not so much <hi>we that live, as
he liveth in us,</hi> Gal. 2. 19, 20. And unbelief is a <hi>not
coming unto him,</hi> that we may have life, Joh. 5. 40. But
secondly, there is also a coming unto him by believers
in the actual exercise of Faith, that they may <hi>have this life
more abundantly,</hi> Joh. 10. 10. That is, such supplies of
Grace as may keep their souls in a healthy, vigorous acting
of all the powers of spiritual life. And as he reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
some that they would not <hi>come unto him that they might</hi>
have <hi>life,</hi> so he may justly reprove us all, that we do not
<hi>so come unto him</hi> in the actual exercise of Faith as that we
might <hi>have this life more abundantly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SECONDLY; When the Lord Christ is near us, and
we do behold his Glory, he will frequently commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
<hi>spiritual refreshment</hi> in peace, consolation, and joy
unto our souls. We shall not only hereby have our
graces excited with respect unto him as their object, but
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:58587:90"/>
be made sensible of his actings <hi>towards us</hi> in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications
of himself and his love unto us. When the Sun
of Righteousness ariseth on any soul, or makes any near
approach thereunto, it shall find <hi>healing under his Wings;</hi>
his beams of Grace shall convey by his spirit, holy spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
refreshment thereunto. For he is present with us
by his spirit, and these are his fruits and effects as he is
the Comforter, suited unto his Office as he is promised
unto us.</p>
               <p>MANY love to walk in a very careless unwise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.
So long as they can hold out in the performance
of outward duties, they are very regardless of the greatest
Evangelical Priviledges; of those things which are the
marrow of divine Promises, all real endeavours of a vital
communion with Christ. Such are spiritual peace, refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
consolations, ineffable joys, and the blessed compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of assurance. Without some taste and experience of
these things, profession is heartless, lifeless, useless; and
Religion it self a dead carcass without an animating soul.
The peace which some enjoy, is a meer stupidity. They
judge not these things to be real, which are the substance
of Christs present reward; and a renunciation whereof
would deprive the Church of its principal supportments
and encouragements in all its sufferings. It is a great evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the power of unbelief, when we can satisfie our
selves without an experience in our own hearts of the
great things in this kind of <hi>Joy, Peace, Consolation, Assurance,</hi>
that are promised in the Gospel. For how can it be supposed
that we do indeed believe the promises of things future,
namely, of Heaven, Immortality and Glory, the faith
whereof is the foundation of all Religion, when we do
not believe the promises of the <hi>present reward,</hi> in these spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Priviledges, And how shall we be thought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, when we do not endeavour after an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:58587:91"/>
of the things themselves in our own souls, but
are even contented without them? But herein men de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceive
themselves. They would very desirously have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical
Joy, Peace and Assurance to countenance them
in their evil frames, and careless walking. And some have
attempted to reconcile these things unto the ruin of their
souls, But it will not be. Without the diligent exercise
of the Grace of Obedience, we shall never enjoy the
Grace of Consolation. But we must speak somewhat of
these things afterwards.</p>
               <p>IT is peculiarly, in the <hi>view of the Glory of Christ,</hi> in
in his approaches unto us, and abiding with us, that we
are made Partakers of Evangelical Peace, Consolation,
Joy and Assurance. These are a part of the Royal Train
of his Graces, of the Reward wherewith he is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied;
<hi>His reward is with him.</hi> Wherever he is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
present with any, these things are never wanting in
a due measure and degree, unless it be by their own
fault, or for their trial. In these things doth he give the
Church of his loves, Cant. 7. 12. For <hi>if any man</hi> (saith he)
<hi>loveth me, I will love him, and manifest my self unto him,</hi> Joh,
14. 21. <hi>Yea, I and the Father will come unto him and make
our abode with him, v.</hi> 23. and that so as to <hi>sup with him,</hi>
Rev. 3. 20. which on his part, can be only by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of those spiritual refreshments. The only
enquiry is by what <hi>way</hi> and <hi>means</hi> we do receive them?
Now I say this is in and by our <hi>beholding of the Glory of
Christ by Faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 9, 10. Let that Glory be rightly
stated as before laid down; the Glory of his Person, his
Office, his Condescention, Exaltation, Love and Grace;
let Faith be fixed in a view and contemplation of it, mix
it self with it as represented in the Glass of the Gospel,
meditate upon it, embrace it, and virtue will proceed
from Christ, communicating spiritual, supernatural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:58587:91"/>
and joy unto our souls. Yea, in ordinary
cases it is impossible that believers should have a <hi>real pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of this Glory</hi> at any time, but that it will in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
affect their hearts with a sense of his love, which is
the spring of all consolation in them. In the exercise of
Faith on the discoveries of the Glory of Christ made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us in the Gospel, no man shall ever totally want such
intimations of his Love, yea, such effusions of it in his
heart, as shall be a living spring of those spiritual refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>Joh. 4. 14. Rom.</hi> 5. 5. When therefore we lose
these things as unto a sense of them in our souls, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that the Lord Christ is withdrawn, and that we do
not behold his Glory.</p>
               <p>BUT I cannot here avoid another short digression.
There are those by whom all these things are derided as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered
fancies and imaginations. Yea, such things
have been spoken and written of them, as contain a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
renunciation of the Gospel, the powers of the World
to come and the whole work of the Holy Ghost as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter
of the Church. And hereby all real entercourse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Person of Christ,</hi> and the souls of them that do
believe, is utterly overthrown; reducing all Religion to
an outward shew and a pageantry, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itter for a stage, than
that Temple of God which is in the minds of men. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
unto the sentiments of these <hi>prophane scoffers,</hi> there
is no such thing as the <hi>shedding abroad of the love of God in
our hearts by the Holy Ghost;</hi> nor as the <hi>witnessing of the
spirit of God with our spirits, that we are the Children of God;</hi>
from which these spiritual joys and refreshments are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable,
as their necessary effects. No such thing, as
the <hi>lifting up of the Light of Gods countenance upon us, which
will put gladness into our hearts;</hi> that gladness which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizeth
all the things mentioned; No such thing as <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
upon Believing with joy unspeakable and full of Glory;</hi>
no such thing as <hi>Christs shewing and manifesting himself unto
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58587:92"/>
us, supping with us,</hi> and <hi>giving us of his loves;</hi> that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
promises of a <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ast of fat things, and Wine well refined</hi> in
Gospel-Mercies, are empty and insignificant words; that
all those ravishing joys and exultations of spirit that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of faithful <hi>Martyrs</hi> of old, and in later ages have
enjoyed by a view of the Glory of God in Christ and a
sense of his love, whereunto they gave testimony unto
their last moments in the midst of their torments, were
but fancies and Imaginations. But it is the height of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
in these profane scoffers, that they proclaim their
own Ignorance of those things which are the real powers
of our Religion.</p>
               <p>OTHERS there are, who will not <hi>deny the truth</hi> of
these things. They dare not rise up in contradiction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those express Testimonies of the Scripture, wherewith
they are confirmed. And they do suppose that some are
partakers of them, at least they were so <hi>formerly;</hi> but as
for their parts, they have no experience of them, nor do
judge it their duty to endeavour after it. They can
make a shift to live on hopes of Heaven and future Glory:
As unto what is present they desire no more, but to be
found in the performance of some duties in answer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their convictions, which gives them that sorry peace
which they do enjoy. So do many countenance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their spiritual sloth and unbelief, keeping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at liberty to seek for refreshment and satisfaction in
other things, whilst those of the Gospel are despised. And
these things are inconsistent. While men look for their
<hi>chief refreshment</hi> and <hi>satisfaction</hi> in temporal things, it is
impossible they should seek after those that are spiritual
in a due manner. And it must be confessed, that when
we have a due regard unto spiritual, evangelical Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
and Joys, it will abate and take off our affections
unto, and satisfaction in present enjoyments, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3 8, 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:58587:92"/>
BUT there is no more sacred truth than this; That
where Christ is present with Believers, where he is not
withdrawn for a season from them, where they live in
the view of his Glory by faith as it is proposed unto them
in the Gospel, he will give unto them at his own sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
such intimations of his love, such supplies of his
spirit, such holy joys and rejoycings, such repose of soul
in assurance, as shall refresh their souls, fill them with
joy, satisfie them with spiritual delight, and quicken them
unto all acts of holy Communion with himself.</p>
               <p>LET no such <hi>dishonour</hi> be reflected on the Gospel, that
whereas the faith of it, and obedience unto it, are usually
accompanied with outward Troubles, Afflictions, Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Reproaches, as we are foretold they should be;
that it doth not by its inward consolations and divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshments,
outballance all those evils which we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
upon the account of it. So to suppose, is expresly
contrary to the promise of Christ himself who hath as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
that even <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>even now in this life,</hi>
in this world, distinct from eternal life; in the world to
come, <hi>we shall receive an hundred-fold recompence</hi> for all that,
we can lose or suf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er for his his sake, Mat. 10. 30. as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
unto the experience of them who in all ages have <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
joyfully the spoiling of their goods, as knowing in themselves</hi>
(by the experience which they have of its first fruits) <hi>that
they have in heaven a better and more abiding substance,</hi> Heb.
10. 29, 30. If we come short in a participation of these
things, if we are strangers unto them, the blame is to be
laid on our selves alone, as it shall be immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>NOW the design of the Lord Christ in thus <hi>withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
himself from us, and <hi>hiding his glory</hi> from our view, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the exercise of our Graces, and to stir us up unto
diligence in our enquiries after him, here lieth our gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
and direction in this case. Do we find our selves
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:58587:93"/>
lifeless in the spiritual duties of Religion? Are we stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
unto the heavenly visits of consolation and joys, those
<hi>visitations of God</hi> whereby he preserves our souls? Do we
seldom enjoy a sense of the <hi>shedding abroad of his love in
our hearts by the holy Ghost?</hi> We have no way of Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
but this alone. To this <hi>strong Tower</hi> must we turn
our selves as <hi>Prisoners of hope;</hi> unto Christ must we look
that we may be saved. It is a steady view or contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Glory by faith alone, that will bring in all
these things in a lively experience in our hearts and
souls.</p>
               <p>AGAIN; In the <hi>second place,</hi> it is from <hi>our selves</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally,
if we lose the views of the Glory of Christ, and
the exercise of faith be obstructed therein. All our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
disadvantages do arise from our selves. It is the
remainder of lusts and corruptions in us, either indulged
by sloth and negligence, or excited and inflamed by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
Temptations, that do obstruct us in this duty.
Whilst they are in any disorder or disturbance, it is in
vain for us to expect any clear view of this Glory.</p>
               <p>THAT view of the Glory of Christ, whereof we
treat, consists in two things; namely, its <hi>especial Nature,</hi>
and its necessary <hi>Adjunct</hi> or effect. The first is, a <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
perception or understanding of it as revealed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
For the revelation of the Glory of his Person, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and Grace, is the Principal Subject of them, and the
principal Object of our Faith. And the other consists
in <hi>multiplied thoughts about him,</hi> with actings of Faith in
Love, Trust, Delight, and longing after the the full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of him, 1 Pet. 1. 8. If we satisfie our selves in
meer notions and speculations about the Glory of Christ
as doctrinally revealed unto us, we shall find no trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
power or efficacy communicated unto us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
But when under the conduct of that spiritual Light
our affections do cleave unto him with full purpose of heart,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58587:93"/>
our minds are filled with thoughts of him, and delight in
him, and faith is kept up unto its constant exercise in
Trust and Affiance on him, virtue will proceed from him
to purifie our hearts, increase our holiness, strengthen our
Graces, and to <hi>fill us</hi> sometimes <hi>with joy unspeakable and full
of Glory.</hi> This is the just temperature of a state of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
health; namely, when our <hi>Light</hi> of the knowledge
of the Glory of God in Christ, doth answer the <hi>means</hi>
of it which we enjoy; and when our <hi>Affections</hi> unto
Christ do hold proportion unto that light; and this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
unto the various degrees of it; for some have
more, and some have less. Where <hi>Light</hi> leaves the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
behind, it ends in Formality or Atheism: And
where <hi>Affections</hi> outrun <hi>Light</hi> they sink in the Bog of
Superstition, doting on Images and Pictures or the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.
But where things go not into these excesses, it is better
that our affections exceed our light on the defect of our
understandings, than that our light exceed our affections
from the corruption of our wills. In both these is the
exercise of faith frequently interrupted and obstructed by
the remainder of corruption in us, especially if not kept
constantly under the <hi>discipline of Mortification,</hi> but some
way indulged unto. For,</p>
               <p>1. THE <hi>steam of their disorder</hi> will cloud and darken
the understanding, that it shall not be able clearly to
discern any spiritual object, least of all the greatest of
them. There is nothing more acknowledged even in
things natural and moral than that the disorder of the
passions and affections will blind, darken, and deceive the
mind in its Operations. And it is much more so in things
<hi>spiritual,</hi> wherein that Disorder is an immediate Rebellion
against its proper conducting Light; that is, against the
Light and Rule of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:58587:94"/>
THERE are three sorts of them unto whom the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
is preached, in whom there are various Obstructions
of this view.</p>
               <p>1. THERE is in obstinate unbelievers a darkness
that is an effect of the power of Satan on their minds,
in blinding of them, which makes it impossible for them
to behold any thing of the Glory of Christ. So the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
declares it, <hi>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid unto them
that are lost, in whom the God of this World hath blinded the
minds of them that believe not, lest the light of the glorious
Gospel of Christ, who is the Image of God, should shine unto
them,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 3, 4. Of these we do not speak.</p>
               <p>2. THERE is in all men, a <hi>corrupt, natural darkness;</hi> or
such a depravation of their minds by nature, as that they
cannot discern this Glory of Christ in a due manner. Hence
<hi>the Light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it
not,</hi> John. 1. 5. For the <hi>natural man receiveth not the things of
the spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, neither can
he know them, because they are spiritually discerned,</hi> 1 Cor.
2. 14. Hence it is that although Christ be preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us continually, yet there are very few who discern
any Glory or Beauty in him, for which <hi>he should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,</hi>
as the Prophet complains, Isa. 53. 1, 2. But I speak
not of this <hi>natural darkness</hi> in general. But even these
persons have their minds filled with prejudices against
the Gospel and darkned as unto the Glory of Christ ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as corrupt lusts and affections are prevalent in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hem, see Joh. 1. 44. <hi>chap.</hi> 12. 43. Hence is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
that is among the common hearers of the word.
For although no man can do any thing of himself for the
receiving of Christ, and the beholding of his Glory,
without the especial aid of the Grace of God, Mat. 11.
24. John. 6. 44, 45; Yet some may make more oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
unto believing, and lay more hindrances in their
own way, than others; which is done by their lusts and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:58587:94"/>
3. THERE are those in whom both these evils are
cured by faith, wherein the eyes of our <hi>understandings are
enlightened</hi> to perceive and discern spiritual things, <hi>Ephes.</hi>
1. 16, 17, 18. But this cure is wrought in this life but
in part, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. And in this cure by a supply of
a principle of saving light unto our minds, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
degrees. For some have a clearer light than others,
and thereby a more clear discerning of the Mystery of
the Wisdom of God, and of the Glory of Christ there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
But whatever be our attainments herein, that which
obstructs this light, that hinders it from shining in a due
manner, <hi>that</hi> obstructs and hinders faith in its view of the
Glory of Christ. And this is done by the <hi>remainders of
corrupted nature</hi> in us, when they act in any prevalent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
For they darken the mind and weaken it in its
spiritual Operations. That is, where any corrupt and
inordinate affections, as love of the world, cares about it,
inclinations unto sensuality, or the like spiritual disorders
do prevail, faith is weakened in its spiritual acts, especially
in discerning and beholding the Glory of Christ. For the
mind is rendered <hi>unsteady</hi> in its enquiries after it, being
continually distracted and diverted with vain thoughts
and Imaginations.</p>
               <p>PERSONS under the Power of such Distempers may
have the same <hi>doctrinal knowledge</hi> of the Person of Christ his
Office and his grace with other men, and the same evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of its Truth fixed on their minds; but when they
endeavour a real <hi>intuition</hi> into the things themselves, all
things are <hi>dark</hi> and confused unto them from the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
and instability of their own minds.</p>
               <p>THIS is the sum of what I do design. We have by
Faith a View of the Glory of Christ. This View is
weak and unsteady from the Nature of Faith it self, and
the way of its proposal unto us as in a <hi>Glass,</hi> in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of what by <hi>Sight</hi> we shall attain unto. But more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:58587:95"/>
where corrupt Lusts or inordinate Affections are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged
unto, where they are not continually <hi>mortified,</hi>
where any one sin hath a perplexing prevalency in the
Mind, Faith will be so far weakened thereby, as that it
can neither see nor meditate upon this Glory of Christ
in a due manner. This is the Reason why the most are
so weak and unstable in the performance of this Duty,
yea are almost utterly unacquainted with it. The Light
of Faith in the Minds of Men being impaired, cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
darkned by the prevalency of unmortified Lusts; it
cannot make such discoveries of this Glory, as otherwise
it would do. And this makes the preaching of Christ
unto many so unprofitable as it is.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY; In the View of the Glory of Christ
which we have by Faith, it will fill the Mind with
<hi>Thoughts and Meditations</hi> about him, whereon the affections
will cleave unto him with delight. This, as was said, is
inseparable from a spiritual View of his Glory in its due
exercise. Every one that hath it, must and will have many
<hi>Thoughts,</hi> concerning, and great affections to him. See
the description of these things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8, 10. It is not
possible, I say, that we should behold the Glory of his
Person, Office and Grace, with a due conviction of our
concernment and interest therein, but that our Minds
will be greatly affected with it, and be filled with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations
about it. Where it is not so with any, it is
to be feared that they <hi>have not heard his voice at any time,
nor seen his shape,</hi> whatever they profess. A spiritual
sight of Christ will assuredly produce love unto him, and
if any Man love him not, he never saw him, he knows
him not at all. And that is no love, which doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
in us many <hi>thoughts</hi> of the object beloved. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
who is partaker of this Grace, will think much
of what Christ is in himself, of what he hath done for
us, of his love and condescention, of the manifestation
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58587:95"/>
of all the glorious excellencies of the Divine Nature in
him, exerted in a way of infinite Wisdom and Goodness
for the Salvation of the Church. Thoughts and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of these things will abound in us, if we are not
wanting unto the due exercise of Faith: and intense in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
Affections unto him, will ensue thereon, at least
they will be active unto our own refreshing experience.
And where these things are not in reality (though in some
they may be only in a mean and low degree) Men do but
deceive their own Souls in hopes of any benefit by Christ
or the Gospel.</p>
               <p>THIS therefore is the present case. Where there are
prevailing sinful Distempers or inordinate Affections in
the Mind, such as those before mentioned, as Self love,
love of the World, cares and fears about it, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
valuation of relations and enjoyments; they will
so far cumber and perplex it with a multitude of thoughts
about their own Objects, as shall leave no place for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
Meditations on Christ and his Glory. And where
the thoughts are engaged, the Affections which partly
excite them, and partly are led by them, will be fixed
also, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>THIS is that which in the most, greatly promoteth
that <hi>imperfection,</hi> which is in our View of the Glory of
Christ, by Faith in this Life. According to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and degree of the prevalency of Affections, corrupt,
earthly, selfish or sensual, filling the Heads and Hearts
of Men with a multitude of thoughts about what they
are fixed on, or inclined unto; so is Faith obstructed and
weakened in this Work and Duty.</p>
               <p>WHEREFORE, whereas there is a remainder of these
Lusts, as to the Seeds of them in us all, tho more mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
in some than in others; yet having the same effects
in the minds of all, according to the Degree of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder;
thence it is as from an Efficacious cause of it,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:58587:96"/>
that our View of the Glory of Christ by Faith, is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
so weak, imperfect and unsteady.</p>
               <p>THIRDLY, We have interruption given unto the
work of Faith herein, by the <hi>Temptations of Satan.</hi> His
original great design, wherever the Gospel is preached, is
to <hi>blind the Eyes of Men, that the Light of the glorious Gospel
of Christ, who is the Image of God, should not shine into them,
or irradiate</hi> their Minds, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. And herein he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails
unto astonishment. Let the Light of the Gospel in
the preaching of the Word be never so glorious; yet by
various means and artifices, he blinds the Minds of the
most, that they shall not behold any thing of the Glory
of Christ therein. By this means he continues his rule
in the Children of Disobedience. With respect unto the
Elect, God overpowers him herein. He <hi>shines into their
Hearts to give them the Knowledge of his Glory in the face of
Christ Jesus,</hi> vers. 6. Yet will not Satan so give over. He
will endeavour by all ways and means to trouble, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compose,
<hi>and darken</hi> the mind even of them that believe,
so as that they shall not be able to retain clear and distinct
Views of this Glory. And this he doth two ways.</p>
               <p>1. WITH some he imploys all his Engines, useth
all his Methods of Serpentine Subtilty, and casts in his
fiery Darts, so to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>squiet, discompose and deject them,
as that they can retain no comfortable Views of Christ
or his Glory. Hence arise fears, doubts, disputes, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties,
with various Disconsolations. Hereon they cannot
apprehend the Love of Christ, nor be sensible of any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
they have therein, or any refreshing perswasions
that they are accepted with him. If such things some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
shine and beam into their Minds, yet they quickly
vanish and disappear. Fears that they are rejected and
cast off by him, that he will not receive them here nor
hereafter, do come in their place; hence are they filled
with Anxieties and Despondencies, under which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:58587:96"/>
they should have any clear View of his Glory.</p>
               <p>I KNOW that <hi>Ignorance, Atheism</hi> and <hi>Obstinate Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
in sensual Sins, do combine to despise all these things.
But it is no new thing in the World, that Men outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
professing Christian Religion, when they find gain in
that God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iness, should speak evil of the things which
they know not, and corrupt themselves in what they
know naturally, as bruit Beasts.</p>
               <p>2. WITH others he deals after another manner. By
various means he seduceth them into a <hi>careless Security</hi>
wherein they promise Peace unto themselves without any
diligent search into these things. Hereon they live in a
general presumption that they shall be saved by Christ,
although they know not how. This makes the Apostle
so earnest in pressing the Dury of self-examination on all
Christians, 2 Cor. 13. 5. <hi>Examine your selves whether you
be in the Faith: Prove your own selves: know you not your own
selves that Christ is in you, except you be reprobates?</hi> The
Rule of Self-judging prescribed by him, is <hi>whether Christ
be in us or no;</hi> and in us he cannot be, unless he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by that Faith wherewith we behold his Glory. For
by Faith we receive him, and by Faith he dwelleth in
our hearts. <hi>Joh. 1. 12. Eph.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
               <p>THIS is the principal way of his prevailing in the
World. Multitudes by his Seduction live in great <hi>security</hi>
under the utmost neglect of these things. Security is
granted to be an Evil destructive of the Souls of Men;
but then it is supposed to consist only in Impenitency for
great and open Sins; but to be neglective of endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an experience of the Power and Grace of the Gospel
in our own Souls, under a Profession of Religion, is no
less destructive and pernicious, than impeni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ency in any
course of sin.</p>
               <p>THESE and the like Obstructions unto Faith in its
Operations being added unto its own imperfections, are
another cause whence our View of the Glory of Christ in
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:58587:97"/>
this World is <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>unsteady;</hi> so that for the most
part it doth but transiently affect our Minds, and not so
fully transform them into his likeness, as otherwise it would.</p>
               <p>IT is now time to consider, that sight which we shall
have of the Glory of Christ in Heaven, in comparison of
that which we have herebelow. Now this is <hi>equal, stable,
always the same without interruption or diversion.</hi> And this
is evident, both in the causes or means of it, as also in
our perfect Deliverance from every thing that might be
an hindrance in it, or an obstrunction unto it.</p>
               <p>1. WE may consider the <hi>state of our minds</hi> in Glory.
The faculties of our Souls shall then be made perfect,
Heb. 12. <hi>The Spirits of just Men made perfect. (1.)</hi> Freed
from all the clogs of the flesh, and all its influence upon
them, and restraint of their Powers in their Operations.
(2.) Perfectly purified from all Principles of instability and
variety; of all Inclinations unto things Sensual and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and all Contrivances of Self-preservation or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,
being wholly transformed into the Image of
God, in spirituality and holiness. And to take in the
state of our <hi>Bodies</hi> after the Resurrection; even they also
in all their Powers and Senses, shall be made entirely
subservient unto the most spiritual actings of our Minds
in their highest Elevation by the Light of Glory. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
shall we be enabled and sitted eternally to abide in the
Contemplation of the Glory of Christ, with joy and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
The understanding shall be always perfected
with the Vision of God, and the Affections cleave infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
to him; which is Blessedness.</p>
               <p>THE very <hi>essential faculties</hi> of our Souls in that way
and manner of working, which by their Union with
our Bodies they are confined unto, are not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
and abide constantly in the Contemplation of this
Glory. So that, though our sight of it here be dim and
imperfect, and the proposal of it obscure; yet from the
weakness of our minds, we are forced sometimes to turn
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:58587:97"/>
aside from what we do discern, as we do our bodily eyes
from the beams of the Sun, when it shines in its brightness.
But in this perfect State they are able to behold and delight
in this Glory constantly, with eternal satisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>BVT as for me (saith David) I will behold thy face in
Righteousness; I shall be satisfied when I awake, with thy
likeness,</hi> Psal. 17. 15. It is Christ alone, who is the <hi>Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>Image</hi> of God. When we <hi>awake</hi> in the <hi>other World,</hi>
with our Minds purified and rectified, the beholding of
him shall be always satisfying unto us. There will be the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
no Satiety, no Weariness, no Indispositions; but the
Mind being made perfect in all its faculties, powers and
operations, with respect unto its utmost end, which is
the enjoyment of God, is satisfied in the beholding of
him for evermore. And where there is perfect satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
without Satiety, there is blessedness for ever. So the
Holy Spirit affirms of the <hi>four living Creatures</hi> in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation;
<hi>They rest not day nor night, saying, holy, holy, holy
Lord God Almighty,</hi> Chap. 4. 8. They are continually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
in the Admiration and Praises of God in Christ,
without weariness or interruption. Herein shall we be
made <hi>like unto Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. AS our Minds in their <hi>essential powers</hi> and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
shall be enabled to comprehend and acquiesce
in this Glory of Christ, so the <hi>means</hi> or <hi>instrument</hi> of the
beholding of it, is much more excellent than <hi>Faith,</hi> and
in its kind absolutely perfect, as hath in part been before
declared. This is <hi>vision</hi> or <hi>sight.</hi> Here we walk by <hi>Faith,</hi>
there by <hi>Sight.</hi> And this <hi>Sight</hi> is not an <hi>external aid,</hi> like
a Glass helping the weakness of the <hi>visive faculty</hi> to see
things afar off; but it is an <hi>internal power,</hi> or an act of
the internal power of our Minds, wherewith they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
in a glorified state. Hereby we shall be able to
<hi>see him face to face, to see him as he is,</hi> in a direct compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of his Glory; for this sight or visive power shall
be given us for this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:58587:98"/>
do. Hereunto the whole Glory of Christ is clear, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous
and evident, which will give us eternal Acquies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
therein. Hence shall our sight of the Glory of
Christ be <hi>invariable,</hi> and always the same.</p>
               <p>2. THE Lord Christ will never in any <hi>one instance,</hi>
on <hi>any occasion,</hi> so much as one moment <hi>withdraw himself</hi>
from us, or Eclipse the proposal and manifestation of
himself unto our sight. This he doth sometimes in this
life, and it is needful for us that so he should do. <hi>We
shall be ever with the Lord, 1 Thes.</hi> 4. 17. without end,
without interruption. This is the Center of good and
evil, as to the future different states of Men. <hi>They shall
be for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ver.</hi> Eternity makes them absolutely good on the
one hand, and absolutely evil on the other. To be in
<hi>Hell</hi> under the wrath of God, is in it self the greatest
penal Evil: But to be there <hi>for ever,</hi> without the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of Misery, or Determination of Time, is that
which renders it the greatest evil unto them who shall be
in that condition. So is <hi>Eternity</hi> the Life of future Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness.
We shall be <hi>ever with the Lord,</hi> without Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Time, without Interruption of Enjoyment.</p>
               <p>THERE are no vicissitudes in the heavenly state, The
New <hi>Hierusalem</hi> hath no Temple in it, <hi>for the Lord God
Almighty, and the Lamb are the Temple thereof,</hi> Revel. 21.
24. There is no need of instituted means of Worship,
nor of Ordinances of Divine Service. For we shall need
neither encrease of Grace, nor Excitations unto its exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.
The constant, immediate, uninterrupted enjoyment
of God and the Lamb, supplieth all. And it hath <hi>no
need of the Sun, nor of the Moon to shine in it; for the Glory of
God doth enlighten it, and the Lamb is the Light thereof.</hi> The
Light of the Sun is excellent; howbeit, it hath its Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
after it hath shone in its brightest Lustre, it gives
place to the night and darkness. So is the Light of the
<hi>Moon</hi> of great use in the Night; but it hath its Seasons
also. Such is the Light we have of the Glory of God
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58587:98"/>
and the Lamb in this World. Sometimes it is as the
Light of the <hi>Sun,</hi> which under the Gospel is <hi>seven fold,</hi> as
the <hi>Light of Seven Days</hi> in one, in comparison of the Law,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 30. 26. Sometimes as the Light of the <hi>Moon,</hi> which
giveth relief in the Night of Temptations and Trials. But
it is not constant; we are under a vicissitude of Light
and Darkness, Views of Christ, and a loss of him. But
in Heaven the perpetual presence of Christ with his
Saints, makes it always <hi>one Noon</hi> of Light and Glory.</p>
               <p>3. THIS <hi>Vision</hi> is not in the least liable unto any
weaknings from <hi>internal defects,</hi> nor any <hi>assaults from
Temptations,</hi> as is the <hi>sight</hi> of Faith in this Life. No
Doubts or Féars, no disturbing Darts or Injections shall
there have any place. There shall no Habit, no Quality,
no Inclination or Disposition remain in our Souls, but
what shall eternally lead us unto the Contemplation of the
Glory of Christ, with delight and complacencey. Nor will
there be any defect in the gracious Powers of our Souls, as
unto a perpetual exercise of them; and as unto all other <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
Enemies,</hi> we shall be in a perpetual triumph over them,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 55, 56, 57. The mouth of iniquity shall be
stopped for ever, and the voice of the self avenger shall
be heard no more.</p>
               <p>WHEREFORE the <hi>Vision</hi> which we shall have in
Heaven of the Glory of Christ, is <hi>Serene;</hi> always the
same, always new and indeficient, wherein nothing can
disturb the Mind in the most perfect Operations of a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Life. And when all the faculties of the Soul can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any internal weakness or external hindrances exercise
their most perfect operations on the most perfect Object;
therein lies all the <hi>blessedness</hi> which our nature is capable
of.</p>
               <p>WHEREFORE, whenever in this life we attain any
comfortable refreshing View of the Glory of Christ, by
the exercise of Faith on the Revelation of it, with a sense
of our interest therein, we cannot but long after, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:58587:99"/>
desire to come unto this more perfect abiding, invariable
Aspect of it.</p>

1, 2, 3, 4. or as <hi>John</hi> had in the Revelation, <hi>Chap. 1. vers.</hi>
13, 14, 15, 16. We need it not, it would be of no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
unto us. For as unto the assurance of our Faith,
we have a <hi>word of prophesie</hi> more useful unto us, than a
<hi>Voice from Heaven, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 17, 18, 19. And of those
who received such Visions, tho of eminent use unto the
Church; yet as unto themselves, one of them cryed out,
<hi>Wo is me, I am undone;</hi> and the other <hi>fell as dead at his feet.</hi>
We are not able in this life to bear such glorious Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations
of him, unto our Edification.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:58587:99"/>
AND as we have no such external proposals of his
Glory unto us in <hi>Visions,</hi> so neither have we any <hi>New Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi>
of him, by <hi>immediate inspiration.</hi> We can see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it, know nothing of it, but what is proposed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us in the Scripture, and that as it is proposed. Nor
doth the Scripture it self in any one place, make an entire
proposal of the Glory of Christ, with all that belongs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it; nor is it capable of so doing; nor can there be any
such Representation of it, unto our capacity on this side
Heaven. If all the Light of the Heavenly <hi>Luminaries</hi>
had been contracted into one, it would have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive,
not useful to our sight; But being by Divine
Wisdom distributed into <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> each giving
out his own Proportion, it is suited to declare the Glory of
God, and to enlighten the World: So if the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of the Glory of Christ, and all that belongs unto
it, had been committed into one <hi>series and contexture of
Words,</hi> it would have overwhelmed our Minds, rather
than enlightned us. Wherefore God hath distributed the
Light of it through the whole <hi>Firmament</hi> of the Books of
the Old and <hi>New Testament,</hi> whence it communicates it self,
by various parts and degrees unto the proper use of the
Church. In one place we have a description of his <hi>Person,</hi>
and the Glory of it; sometimes in words plain and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and sometimes in great variety of <hi>Allegories,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
an heavenly Sense of things unto the Minds of
them that do believe; In others of his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Condescenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
in his Office, and his Glory therein. His <hi>Humiliation,
Exaltation</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> are in like manner in sundry places
represented unto us. And as <hi>one Star differeth from another
in Glory;</hi> so it was one way, whereby God represented
the Glory of Christ, in Types and Shadows under the
<hi>Old Testament,</hi> and another wherein it is declared in the
<hi>New.</hi> Illustrious Testimonies upon all these things are
planted up and down in the Scripture, which we may
collect as choice flowers in the Paradise of God, for the</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:58587:100"/>
SO the <hi>Spouse</hi> in the <hi>Canticles</hi> considered every part of
the Person and Grace of Christ distinctly by it self, and
from them all, concludes that <hi>he is altogether lovely, Chap.</hi>
5. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. So ought we to do in
our study of the Scripture, to find out the Revelation
of the Glory of Christ, which is made therein, as did the
Prophets of old, as unto what they themselves received
by immediate Inspiration. <hi>They searched diligently what
the spirit of Christ which was in them did signifie, when it
testified before hand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory which
should ensue,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 11, 12. But this seeing of Christ
by parts in the Revelation of him, is one cause why we
see him here but in part.</p>
               <p>SOME suppose that by <hi>Chopping</hi> and <hi>Painting,</hi> and
<hi>Gilding,</hi> they can make an Image of Christ that shall
perfectly represent him to their Sences and carnal Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from head to foot, But they <hi>feed on ashes,</hi> and have
<hi>a lie in their right hand,</hi> Jesus <hi>Christ is evidently crucified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our eyes in the Scripture,</hi> Gal. 3. 1. So also is he evidently
exalted, and glorified therein. And it is the Wisdom
of Faith to gather into one, these <hi>parcelled Descriptions</hi> that
are given of him, that they may be the Object of its View
and Contemplation.</p>
               <p>IN the Vision which we shall have <hi>above,</hi> the whole
Glory of Christ will be at <hi>once</hi> and <hi>always</hi> represented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us; and we shall be enabled in one act of the Light of
Glory to comprehend it. Here indeed we are at a loss;
our minds and understandings fail us in their Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
It will not yet enter into our hearts to conceive
what is the beauty, what is the Glory of this compleat
Representation of Christ unto us. To have at <hi>once</hi> all the
Glory of what he is, what he was in his outward State
and Condition, what he did and suffered, what he is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
unto, his Love and Condescention, his Mystical
Union with the Church, and the Communication of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unto it, with the <hi>Recapitulation</hi> of all things in Him
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:58587:100"/>
and the Glory of God, even the Father, in his Wisdom,
Righteousness, Grace, Love, Goodness, Power, Shining
forth eternally in him, in what he is, hath done, and doth,
all presented unto us in <hi>one view,</hi> all comprehended by
us at once, is that which at present we cannot conceive.
We can long for it, pant after it, and have some fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasts
of it; namely of that State and Season, wherein our
whole Souls in all their powers and faculties, shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,
inseparably, eternally cleave by Love unto whole
Christ in the fight of the Glory of his Person and Grace,
until they are watered, dissolved and inebriated in the
Waters of Life, and the Rivers of Pleasure that are above
for evermore. So must we speak of the things which
we admire, which we adore, which we love, which we long
for, which we have some foretasts of in sweetness inessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which yet we cannot comprehend.</p>
               <p>THESE are some few of those things whence ariseth
the difference between that view which we have here of
the Glory of Christ, and that which is reserved for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
namely, such as are taken from the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>means</hi> or <hi>instruments</hi> of the one and the other,
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Sight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN the last place, the great difference between them,
consists in, and is manifested by their <hi>effects.</hi> Hereof I
shall give some few instances, and close this discourse.</p>
               <p>1. THE Vision which we shall have of the Glory of
Christ in Heaven, and of the Glory of the immense God
in him, is perfectly and absolutely <hi>transforming.</hi> It doth
change us wholly into the Image of Christ. <hi>When we
shall see him, we shall be as he is, we shall be like him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we shall see him,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 2. But although the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
perfecting act of this <hi>Transformation</hi> be an act of
sight, or the sight of Glory; yet there are many things
towards it, or degrees in it, which we may here take
notice of in our way.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:58587:101"/>
1. THE Soul upon its <hi>Departure from the Body,</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
freed from all the Weakness, Disability, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Uncertainties and Fears, which were impressed on it
from the Flesh; wherewith it was in the strictest Union.
The Image of the first <hi>Adam</hi> as fallen, is then abolished.
Yea, it is not only freed from all irregular sinful Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
cleaving to our Nature as corrupted, but from all
those <hi>sinless Grievances</hi> and Infirmities which belong unto
the Original Constitution of it. This necessarily ensues on
the <hi>Dissolution of the Person</hi> in order unto a blessed State.
The first entrance by Mortality into Immortallity, is a
step towards Glory. The ease which a blessed Soul finds
in a deliverance from this Encumbrance, is a Door of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into eternal Rest. Such a change is made in that,
which in it self is the Center of all Evil, namely <hi>Death,</hi>
that it is made a means of freeing us from all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of what is evil.</p>
               <p>FOR this doth not follow absolutely on the Nature of
the thing it self. A <hi>meer Dissolution</hi> of our Natures can
bring no Advantage with it, especially as it is a part of the
Curse. But it is from the Sanctification of it by the
Death of Christ. Hereby that which was Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for the Infliction of Judgment, becomes an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Means for the Communication of Mercy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.
22. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 54. It is by vertue of the Death of Christ
alone, that the Souls of Believers are freed by Death
from all impressions of Sin, Infirmity and Evils, which
they have had from the Flesh, which were their Burden,
under which they groaned all their Days. No Man knows
in any measure the Excellency of this Priviledge, and the
Dawnings of Glory which are in it, who hath not been
wearied, and even worn out, through long conflicting
with the Body of Death. The Soul hereon being freed
from all Annoyances, all Impressions from the Flesh, is
expedite and enlarged unto the Exercise of all its gracious
Faculties, as we shall see immediately.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:58587:101"/>
WITH wicked Men it is not so. Death unto them
is a Curse; and the Curse is the Means of the Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of all Evil, and not Deliverance from any. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they have been warmed and refreshed by the Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
or the Flesh, they shall be deprived of it. But their
Souls in their separate State, are perpetually harrased with
the <hi>disquieting Passions</hi> which have been impressed on their
Minds by their corrupt fleshly Lusts. In vain do such
Persons look for Relief by Death. If there be any thing
remaining of present good and usefulness to them, they
shall be deprived of it. And their Freedom for a Season
from bodily pains, will no way lie in the Ballance against
that Confluence of Evils which Death will let in upon
them.</p>
               <p>2. THE <hi>Spirits of just Men</hi> being freed by Death from
the Clog of the Flesh, not yet refined; all the Faculties
of their Souls, and <hi>all the Graces in them,</hi> as Faith, Love
and Delight, are immediately set at Liberty, enabled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
to exercise themselves on God in Christ. The end
for which they were created, for which our Nature was
endowed with them, was, that we might adhere unto
God by them, and come unto the Enjoyment of him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now freed wholly from all that Impotency, pervers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Disability unto this End, with all the Effects
of them, which came upon them by the <hi>Fall;</hi> they are
carried with a full Stream towards God, cleaving unto
him with the most intense Embraces. And all their Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
towards God, shall be natural, with Facility, Joy,
Delight and Complacency. We know not yet the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the Operations of our Souls in divine things, when
disburdened of their present Weight of their Flesh. And
this is a second step towards the Consummation of Glory.
For,</p>
               <p>IN the <hi>Resurrection of the Body,</hi> upon its full Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it shall be so purified, sanctified, glorified, as to give
no Obstrnction unto the Soul in its Operations, but be a
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:58587:102"/>
blessed Organ for its highest and most spiritual Actings.
The <hi>Body</hi> shall never more be a Trouble, a Burthen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Soul, but an Assistant in its Operations, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipant
of its Blessedness. Our Eyes were made to <hi>see our
Redeemer,</hi> and our other Sences to receive impressions from
him, according unto their Capacity. As the Bodies of
wicked Men shall be restored unto them to encrease and
compleat their Misery in their Sufferings; so shall the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the Just be restored unto them, to heighten and
consummate their Blessedness.</p>
               <p>3. THESE things are <hi>preparatory</hi> unto Glory. The
compleat Communication of it, is by the <hi>Infusion of a new
heavenly Light</hi> into the Mind, enabling us to see the Lord
Christ as he is. The Soul shall not be brought into the
immediate Presence of Christ without a <hi>new Power</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
him, and the immediate Representation of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Faith now doth cease as unto the manner of its O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration
in this Life, whilst we are absent from Christ.
This <hi>Light of Glory</hi> succeeds into its Room, fitted for that
State and all the ends of it, as <hi>Faith</hi> is for that which is
present. And,</p>
               <p>4. IN the <hi>first Operation</hi> of this Light of Glory, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
shall so behold the glory of Christ, and the glory of
God in him, as that therewith, and thereby they shall be
immediately and universally <hi>changed into his Likeness.</hi>
They shall be as he is, when they shall see him as he is.
There is no growth in glory, as unto <hi>Parts,</hi> there may
be as unto <hi>Degrees.</hi> Additions may be outwardly made
unto what is at first received, as by the Resurrection of
the Body; but the internal Light of Glory, and its trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
Efficacy is capable of no degrees, though new
Revelations may be made unto it, unto Eternity. For
the infinite Fountain of Life, and Light, and Goodness,
can never be fathomed, much less exhausted. And what
God spake on the Entrance of sin, by the way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and aproach. <hi>Behold the Man is become like one of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58587:102"/>
us,</hi> upbraiding him with what he had foolishly designed;
on the Accomplishment of the Work of his Gace, he says
in Love and infinite Goodness, <hi>Man is become like one of
us,</hi> in the perfect Restoration of our Image in him. This
is the first Effect of the Light of Glory.</p>
               <p>FAITH also in beholding the glory of Christ in this
Life, is accompanied with a <hi>transforming Efficacy,</hi> as the
Apostle expresly declares, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. It is the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
from whence, and the <hi>Instrumental Cause</hi> whereby all
spiritual change is wrought in us in this Life; but the
Work of it is imperfect; first because it is <hi>gradual,</hi> and
then because it is <hi>partial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. AS unto the <hi>manner</hi> of its Operation, it is <hi>gradual,</hi>
and doth not at once transform us into the Image of
Christ. Yea, the degrees of its Progress therein, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us for the most part imperceptible. It requires much
spiritual Wisdom and Observation to obtain an <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
of them in our own Souls. <hi>The inward man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
day by day,</hi> whilst we behold these invisible things,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16, 17, 18. but how? even as the <hi>outward Man</hi>
decays by Age, which is by insensible Degrees and Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
Such is the <hi>Transformation</hi> which we have by
Faith in its present View of the glory of Christ. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to our Experience of its Efficacy herein, is our
Evidence of its Truth and Realty in the beholding of him.
No Man can have the least ground of assurance that he
hath seen Christ and his glory by Faith, without some
<hi>Effects</hi> of it in changing him into his Likeness. For as
on the Touch of his Garment by the Woman in the
Gospel, Vertue went out from him to heal her Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
So upon this View of Faith, an influence of <hi>trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming</hi>
Power will proceed from Christ unto the Soul.</p>
               <p>2. AS unto the <hi>Event</hi> it is but <hi>partial.</hi> It doth not
bring this Work unto perfection. The change wrought
by it, is indeed great and glorious; or as the Apostle
speaks, it is <hi>from Glory to Glory,</hi> in a Progress of glorious
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:58587:103"/>
Grace: But <hi>absolute perfection</hi> is reserved for Vision. As
unto Divine Worship, <hi>Perfection was not by the Law.</hi> It
did many things preparatory unto the Revelation of the
Will of God concerning it; but it <hi>made nothing perfect:</hi>
So <hi>absolute Perfection</hi> in Holiness, and the Restoration of the
Image of God, is not by the Gospel, is not by Faith;
however it gives us many preparatory degrees unto it, as
the Apostle fully declares, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, <hi>Vision</hi> is <hi>Beatifical,</hi> as it is commonly
called, and that not amiss. It gives perfect Rest and
Blessedness unto them in whom it is. This may be a little
opened in the ensuing Observations.</p>
               <p>1. THERE are <hi>continual Operations</hi> of God in Christ,
in the Souls of them that are glorified, and Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from him unto them. For all Creatures must eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
live even in Heaven, in dependance on him who is
the eternal Fountain of Being, Life, Goodness and Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
unto all. As we cannot subsist one moment in our
Beings, Lives, Souls, Bodies, the inward or outward
Man, without the continual Actings of divine Power in
us, and towards us; so in the glorified State our <hi>All</hi> shall
depend eternally on Divine Power and Goodness, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
themselves unto us, for all the ends of our
blessed Subsistance in Heaven.</p>
               <p>2. WHAT is the <hi>way and manner</hi> of these Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
we cannot comprehend. We cannot indeed ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understand the Nature and way of his <hi>Spiritual Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications</hi>
unto us in this Life. We know these things by
their Signs, their outward Means, and principally by the
Effects they produce in the real change of our Natures.
But in themselves we see but little of them. <hi>The wind
bloweth where it listeth, and we hear the Sound thereof, but
we know not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; so is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one that is born of the Spirit.</hi> Joh. 3. 8. All Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Operations in Heaven and Earth are incomprehensible,
as being Acts of infinite Power and we cannot search
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:58587:103"/>
3. ALL <hi>Communications</hi> from the Divine Being and
infinite Fulness in Heaven unto glorified Saints, are in,
and through Christ Jesus, who shall for ever be the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
of Communication between God and the Church,
even in glory. All things being <hi>gathered into one head</hi> in
him, even things in Heaven, and things in Earth; that
Head being in immediate dependence on God, this Order
shall never be dissolved, <hi>Ephes. 1. 10, 11. 1 Cor.</hi> 3. 23.
And on these Communications from God through Christ
depends entirely our Continuance in a State of Blessedness
and Glory. We shall no more be self-subsistent in glory,
than we are in Nature or Grace.</p>
               <p>4. THE way on our part whereby we shall receive
these Communications from God by Christ, which are
the eternal Springs of Life, Peace, Joy and Blessedness, is
this <hi>Vision,</hi> the <hi>Sight</hi> whereof we speak. For as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
assigned thereunto in the Scripture; so whereas it
contains the perfect Operation of our Minds and Souls in
a perfect State, on the most perfect Object, it is the only
means of our Blessedness. And this is the true Cause
whence there neither is, nor can be any <hi>Satiety</hi> or weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Heaven, in the eternal Contemplation of the same
glory. For not only the <hi>Object</hi> of our sight is absolutely
infinite, which can never be searched into the bottom;
yea, is <hi>perpetually new</hi> unto a finite understanding; so our
<hi>subjective</hi> Blessedness consisting in continual fresh Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications
from the infinite Fulness of the Divine Nature,
derived unto us through <hi>Vision,</hi> is always <hi>new,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
will be so to Eternity. Herein shall all the Saints
of God drink of the <hi>Rivers of Pleasure</hi> that are at his Right
Hand, be satisfied with his Likeness, and refresh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the eternal Springs of Life, Light and Joy for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore.</p>
               <p>THIS <hi>effect</hi> that View which we have by Faith of the
glory of Christ in this World, doth not produce. It is
<hi>Sanctifying,</hi> not <hi>Glorifying.</hi> The best of Saints are far
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:58587:104"/>
from a perfect or <hi>glorified State</hi> in this Life. And that
not only on the account of the <hi>outward Evils,</hi> which in
their Persons they are exposed unto; but also of the
Weakness and Imperfection of their inward State in Grace.
Yet we may observe some things unto the <hi>Honour</hi> of Faith
in them who have received it. As,</p>
               <p>1. IN its due Exercise on Christ, it will give unto
the Souls of Believers some <hi>previous Participation</hi> of future
glory, working in them <hi>Dispositions</hi> unto, and <hi>Preparation</hi>
for the Enjoyment of it.</p>
               <p>2. THERE is no <hi>Glory,</hi> no <hi>Peace,</hi> no <hi>Joy,</hi> no Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in this World to be compared with what we receive
by that weak and <hi>imperfect View</hi> which we have of the
Glory of Christ by Faith. Yea, all the Joys of the
World are a thing of nought in Comparison of what we
so receive.</p>
               <p>3. IT is sufficient to give us such a <hi>Perception,</hi> such a
<hi>Foretaste</hi> of future Blessedness in the Enjoyment of Christ,
as may continually stir us up to breath and pant after it.
But it is not <hi>Beatifical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OTHER Differences of an alike Nature between our
<hi>Beholding of the Glory of Christ</hi> in this Life by Faith, and
that <hi>Vision</hi> of it, which is reserved for Heaven, might be
insisted on; but I shall proceed no further. There is
nothing farther for us to do herein but that now and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
we shut up all our Meditations concerning it, with
the <hi>deepest Self-abasement</hi> out of a Sense of our Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Insufficiency to comprehend those things, <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration</hi>
of that excellent Glory which we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
and <hi>vehement Longings</hi> for that Season when he
shall <hi>see him as he is,</hi> be <hi>ever with him,</hi> and know him,
even as we are known.</p>

unto their <hi>Recovery from Spiritual Decays, and the
Revival of a Spring of vigorous Grace, Holiness and
Obedience in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FOR the first of these, although it seems not
directly to lye in our way, yet is it suited unto
the method of the Gospel, that wherever there is
a Declaration of the Excellencies of Christ, in his
Person, Grace or Office, it should be accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with an Invitation and Exhortation unto Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to come unto him. This method he himself
first made use of, <hi>Mat. 11. 27, 28, 29, 30. Joh.</hi> 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
37, 38. and consecrated it unto our use also. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
it is necessary from the nature of the things
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58587:105"/>
themselves, for who can dwell on the consideration
of the Glory of Christ, being called therewith to
the Declaration of it, but his own mind will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
him to invite lost Sinners unto a participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of him. But I shall at present proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this Exhortation, but only unto the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
of some of those Considerations which may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare,
encline, and dispose their Minds unto a closure
with him as he is tendred in the Gospel. As,</p>
               <p>1. LET them consider well what is their present
State with respect unto God and Eternity. This
<hi>Moses</hi> wisheth for the <hi>Israelites, Deut. 32. 29. Oh
that they were wise, that they understood this, that
they would consider their latter end:</hi> It is the greatest
Folly in the World to leave the Issues of these
things unto an uncertain hazzard: And that Man
who cannot prevail with himself strictly to examine
what is his State and Condition with respect unto
Eternity, doth never do any good, nor abstain
from any evil in a due manner; remember there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that <hi>many are called, but few are chosen.</hi> To
be called, is to enjoy all the outward Priviledges
of the Gospel, which is all you unto whom I speak
can pretend unto, yet this you may do and not be
chosen: Even among those unto whom the Word
is preached, they are but few that shall be saved.
In the Distribution made by our Lord Jesus Christ
of the Hearers of the Word into four sorts of
ground, it was but one of them that received
real Benefit thereby; and if our Congregations
are no better than were his Hearers, there is not
above a fourth part of them that will be saved,
it may be a far less number: And is it not strange
that every one of them is not jealous over him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and his own Condition? Many herein deceive
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58587:105"/>
themselves, until they fall under woful surprizals.
And this is represented in the Account of the final
Judgment; for the generality of those who have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
the Gospel are introduced as complaining
of their Disappointments, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 41, 42, 43.
For what is there spoken, is only a Declaration of
what befell them here in the close of their Lives,
and their Personal Judgment thereon.</p>
               <p>2. TAKE heed of being deluded by common
Presumptions. Most men have some thoughts in
general about what their State is, and what it
will be in the issue: But they make no diligent
search into this matter, because a number of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
presumptions do immediately insinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into their minds for their relief, and they
are such, as all whose force and efficacy unto this
end lies in this, that they differ from others, and
are better than they; as that they are Christians,
that they are in the right way of Religion, that
they are partakers of the outward priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of the Gospel, hearing the Word, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation
of the Sacraments; that they have light
and convictions, so as that they abstain from Sin,
and perform Duties so as others do not, and the
like. All those with whom it is not so, who are
behind them in these things, they judge to be in
an ill State and Condition, whence they entertain
good hopes concerning themselves: and this is all
that most trust unto. It is not my present busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to discourse the vanity of Presumptions, it
hath been done by many; I give only this warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in general unto those who have the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
or purpose to come to Christ, and to be made
partakers of him, that they put no trust in them,
that they rely not on them; for if they do so, they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58587:106"/>
will eternally deceive their Souls. This was a
great part of the preparatory Ministry of <hi>John</hi> the
<hi>Baptist,</hi> Mat. 3. 9. <hi>Think not to say within your selves,
we have Abraham to our Father.</hi> This was their
great comprehensive priviledge, containing all the
outward Church and Covenant Advantages. These
they rested in, and trusted to unto their Ruine:
Herein he designed to undeceive them.</p>
               <p>3. CONSIDER aright what it is to live and
die without an Interest in Christ, without a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation
of him. Where this is not stated in the
mind, where thoughts of it are not continually
prevalent, there can be no one step taken in the
way towards him. Unless we are throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that without him we are in a state of
Apostacy from God, under the Curse, obnoxious
unto Eternal Wrath, as some of the worst of God's
Enemies, we shall never flee unto him for Refuge
in a due manner: <hi>The whole have no need of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,
but the sick; Christ came not to call the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
but Sinners to Repentance:</hi> And the Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
intended, is the principal end of the Ministry
of the Law. The Miseries of this State have been
the subject of innumerable Sermons and Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
but there is a general misery in the whole,
that few take themselves to be concerned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
or apply these things unto themselves. Let
us tell men of it a thousand times, yet they either
take no notice of it, or believe it not, nor look
on it as that which belongs unto the way and
course of preaching, wherein they are not concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
These things it seems Preachers must say, and
they may believe them who have a mind there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
It is a rare thing that any one shall as much
as say unto himself, Is it so with me? And if we
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58587:106"/>
now, together with this Caution, tell the same
Men again, that whilst they are uninterested in
Christ, not ingrafted into him by Faith, that
they run in vain, that all their labour in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is lost, that their Duties are all rejected,
that they are under the Displeasure and Curse
of God, that their End is eternal Destruction,
which are all unquestionably certain, yet will
they let all these things pass by without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
consideration.</p>
               <p>BUT here I must fix with them unto whom I
speak at present, unless there be a full Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in them of the woful deplorable condition of
every Soul of whatever Quality, Profession, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
outward State it be, who is not yet made
partaker of Christ, all that I have further to add
will be of no signification. Remember then that
the due consideration hereof is unto you in your
State, your chiefest concernment in this World:
and be not afraid to take in a full and deep sense
of it, for if you are really delivered from it, and
have good Evidence thereof, it is nothing unto
you but matter of eternal Praise and Thanksgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And if you are not so, it is highly necessary
that your Minds should be possessed with due Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of it. The work of this Conviction is
the first effect of true Religion, and the great Abuse
of Religion in the World is, that a pretence of it
deludes the Minds of men to apprehend that it is not
necessary; for to be of this or that Religion, of this
or that way in Religion, is supposed sufficient to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Eternal State of men, though they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
convinced of their lost estate by Nature.</p>
               <p>4. HEREON consider the Infinite Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scention
and Love of Christ, in his Invitations and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58587:107"/>
Calls of you to come unto him for Life, Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
Mercy, Grace, Peace, and Eternal Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Multitudes of these Invitations and Calls are
recorded in the Scripture, and they are all of them
filled up with those blessed Encouragements, which
Divine wisdom knows to be suited unto lost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
Sinners in their present state and condition.
It were a blessed Contemplation to dwell on the
Consideration of the Infinite Condescention, Grace
and Love of Christ, in his Invitations of Sinners
to come unto him, that they may be saved; of
that mixture of Wisdom and perswasive Grace
that is in them; of the force and efficacy of the
pleading and Argument that they are accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
withal, as they are recorded in the Scripture;
but that belongs not to my present Design: This
I shall only say, that in the Declaration and
Preaching of them, Jesus Christ yet stands before
Sinners, calling, inviting, encouraging of them to
come unto him.</p>
               <p>THIS is somewhat of the Word which he now
speaks unto you. Why will ye dye? why will
ye perish? why will you not have compassion on
your own Souls? Can your Hearts endure, or can
your hands be strong in the day of Wrath that
is approaching? It is but a little while before all
your Hopes, your Reliefs and Presumptions will
forsake you, and leave you eternally miserable:
Look unto me, and be saved; come unto me, and
I will ease you of all Sins, Sorrows, Fears, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
and give rest unto your Souls. Come I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
you, lay aside all Procrastinations, all delays,
put me off no more, Eternity lyes at the door;
cast out all cursed self-deceiving Reserves, do not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58587:107"/>
so hate me, as that you will rather perish than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of Deliverance by me.</p>
               <p>THESE and the like things doth the Lord
Christ continually declare, proclaim, plead and
urge on the Souls of Sinners; as it is fully decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 1. ver. 20. <hi>to the</hi> 34. He doth it in the
preaching of the word, as if he were present with
you, stood amongst you, and spake personally to
every one of you: And because this would not
suit his present state of Glory, he hath appointed
the Ministers of the Gospel to appear before you,
and to deal with you in his stead, avowing, as his
own, the Invitations that are given you in his
Name, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>CONSIDER therefore his Infinite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention,
Grace, and Love herein: Why all this
towards you? doth he stand in need of you? Have
you deserved it at his hands? Did you love him
first? Cannot he be happy and blessed without
you? Hath he any Design upon you, that he is
so earnest in calling you unto him? Alas, it is
nothing but the overflowing of Mercy, Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and Grace that moves and acts him herein.
Here lyes the entrance of innumerable Souls into a
Death and Condemnation far more severe than
those contained in the Curse of the Law, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.
15, 16. In the contempt of this Infinite Condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christ, in his Holy Invitation of Sinners to
himself, lies the sting and poyson of Unbelief,
which unavoidably gives over the Souls of Men
unto Eternal Ruine: And who shall once pity
them to Eternity who are guilty of it? Yea but,</p>
               <p>5. PERHAPS if you should on his Invitation
begin to look to him, and resolve to come to him,
you are greatly afraid that when it comes to the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58587:108"/>
Tryal he will not receive you; for no Heart can
conceive, no Tongue can express what wretched,
vile, and provoking Sinners you have been. That
the Lord Christ will receive unto him such as we
are, we have no hopes, or that ever we shall find
Acceptance with him: I say, it is not amiss when
Persons come so far, as to be sensible of what Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
they have to conflict withall, what
difficulties lye in their way, and what objections
do arise against them, for the most do perish in a
senceless stupidity; they will not consider how it
is with them, what is required of them, nor how
it will be in the latter end; they doubt not but
that either they do believe already, or can do so
when they please; but when any come so far as to
charge the failure of their Acceptance with Christ
on their own unworthiness, and so are discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
from coming unto him, there are Arguments
for their Conviction and Perswasion, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Devil and Unbelief can defeat:
Wherefore, that which is now proposed unto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
in answer hereunto, is the Readiness of
Christ to receive every Sinner, be he who or what
he will, that shall come unto him: And hereof
we have the highest Evidences that Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Grace can give unto us. This is the
Language of the Gospel, of all that the Lord
Christ did or suffered, which is recorded therein.
This is the Divine Testimony of the Three that
bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word,
and the Holy Ghost; and of the Three that bear
witness in Earth, the Spirit, the Water, and the
Blood, all give their joynt Testimony, that the
Lord Christ is ready to receive all Sinners that
come to him; they who receive not this Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58587:108"/>
make God a Lyar, both Father, Son, and
Spirit. Whatever the Lord Christ is in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of his Person, in the Representation of
the Father, in his Office, in what he did on the
Earth, in what he doth in Heaven, proclaims the
same Truth. Nothing but cursed Obstinacy in
Sin and Unbelief can suggest a thought unto our
minds, that he is not willing to receive us when
we come unto him. Herein we are to bear Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
against the Unbelief of all unto whom
the Gospel is preached, that come not unto
him. Unbelief acting it self herein, includes a
contempt of the Wisdom of God, a Denial of his
Truth or Faithfulness, an Impeachment of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of Christ in his Invitations, making him a
Deceiver, and will issue in an express hatred of
his Person and Office, and of the Wisdom of God
in him. Here then you are shut up, you cannot
from hence take any Countenance unto your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</p>
               <p>6. CONSIDER that he is as able to Save
us, as he is ready and willing to Receive us. The
Testimonies which he hath given us unto his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Love are uncontrollable, and none dare
directly to call in Question, or deny his Power.
Generally this is taken for granted by all, that
Christ is able to save us if he will; yea, who
shall question his Ability to save us, though we
live in Sin and Unbelief, and many expect that he
will do so, because they believe he can if he will:
But indeed Christ hath no such Power, no such
Ability; he cannot save unbelieving impenitent
Sinners, for this cannot be done without denying
himself, acting contrary to his Word, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
his own Glory. Let none please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58587:109"/>
with such vain Imaginations, Christ is able
to save all them, and only them who come to
God by him. Whilst you live in Sin and Unbelief
Christ himself cannot save you; but when it
comes to the Tryal in particular, some are apt
to think, that although they will not conclude
that Christ cannot save them, yet they do on va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
accounts, that they cannot be saved by him.
This therefore we also give Testimony unto, in
our Exhortation to come unto him; namely, that
his power to save those that shall comply with
his Call is Soveraign, Incontrollable, Almighty,
that nothing can stand in the way of. All things
in Heaven and Earth are committed unto him, all
power is his, and he will use it unto this end,
namely, the assured Salvation of all that come
unto him.</p>
               <p>7. CONSIDER greatly what hath been spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the Representation of God, and all the
Holy Properties of his Nature in Him. Nothing
can possibly give us more encouragement to come
unto him; for we have manifested, that God
who is infinitely Wise and Glorious, hath design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to exert all the Holy Properties of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
his Mercy, Love, Grace Goodness, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
Wisdom and Power in him, in and unto
the Salvation of them that do believe. Whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
therefore comes unto Christ by Faith on this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of the Glory of God in him, he ascribes
and gives unto God all that Glory and Honour
which he aimeth at from his Creatures, and we
can do nothing wherewith he is pleased equal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it. Every poor Soul that comes by Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ, gives unto God all that Glory which
it is his Design to manifest and be exalted in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58587:109"/>
and what can we do more? There is more Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
given unto God by coming unto Christ in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
than in keeping the whole Law, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as he hath more eminently manifested the
holy Properties of his Nature in the way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by Christ, than in giving of the Law:
There is therefore no Man who under Gospel In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations
refuseth to come unto, and close with
Christ by believing, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, through the
Power of Darkness, Blindness, and Unbelief, he
hates God, dislikes all his ways, would not have
his Glory exalted, nor manifested, choosing rather
to dye in Enmity against him, than to give Glory
to him. Do not deceive your selves, it is not an
indifferent thing, whether you will come in unto
Christ upon his Invitations or no; a thing that
you may put off from one season unto another:
Your present Refusal of it is as high an Act of
Enmity against God, as your Nature is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of.</p>
               <p>8. CONSIDER that by coming unto Christ,
you shall have an interest in all that Glory which
we have proposed unto you: for Christ will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
yours more intimately than your Wives and
Children are yours, and so all his Glory is yours
also. All are apt to be affected with the good
things of their Relation, their Grace, their Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
their Beauty, their Power; for they judge
themselves to have an Interest in them, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their Relation unto them. Christ is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to Believers than any Natural Relations are to
us whatever; they have therefore an Interest in
all his Glory. And is this a small thing in
your Eyes, that Christ shall be yours, and all
his Glory shall be yours, and you shall have the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58587:110"/>
advantage of it unto your Eternal Blessedness?
Is it nothing unto you to continue Strangers from
and uninterested in all this Glory? To be left to
take your portion in this World in Lusts and Sins,
and Pleasures, and a few perishing Trifles with
Eternal Ruine in the close, whilst such durable
Substance, such Riches of Glory are tendred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you?</p>
               <p>LASTLY, Consider the horrible ingratitude
there is in a neglect or refusal to come in to Christ
upon his Invitation, with the doleful Eternal Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
that will ensue thereon: <hi>How shall we escape if
we neglect so great Salvation?</hi> Impenitent Unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
under the preaching of the Gospel, are the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
and most ungrateful of all Gods Creation.
The Devils themselves, as wicked as they are, are
not guilty of this Sin, for Christ is never ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
unto them, they never had an offer of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on Faith and Repentance; this is their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Sin, and will be the peculiar Aggravation
of their misery unto Eternity. Hear ye Despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,
wonder and perish. The sin of the Devil is
in malice and opposition unto knowledge, above
what the Nature of Man is capable of in this
World. Men therefore must sin in some instance
above the Devil, or God would not give them
their Eternal Portion with the Devil and his Angels:
this is Unbelief.</p>
               <p>SOME it may be will say, What then shall
we do? What shall we apply our selves unto?
What is it that is required of us?</p>
               <p>1. TAKE the Advice of the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.
7, 8, 13.—<hi>To day if you will hear his voice, harden
not your hearts, as in the provocation in the day of
Temptation in the Wilderness: But exhort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58587:110"/>
daily, while it is called to day; lest any of you be
hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</hi> This day,
even this is unto you in the tender of Grace the
acceptable time, this is the day of Salvation. Others
have had this day as well as you, and have missed
their Opportunity; take heed lest it should be so
with you also. How if any one should write it
down, or peculiarly commit it to remembrance,
this day there was a tender of Christ and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in him made unto my Soul; from this time I
will resolve to give up my self unto him. And
if you find your Resolutions, charge your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
with what you have engaged, and
make your selves to know, that if you go back
from it, it is a token that you are going to
Ruine.</p>
               <p>2. CONSIDER that it is high time for you
to make somewhat of Religion. Do not hang al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in suspense; let it not be a question with
your selves, whether you have a mind to be saved
or no. This is as good a time and season for a
Resolution as ever you are like to have whilst in
this World. Some things, nay, many things may
fall in between this and the next opportunity, that
shall put you backward, and make your entrance
into the Kingdom of Heaven far more difficult
than ever it was; and the living in that uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
at best, which you do, of what will become
of you unto Eternity, is the most miserable kind
of Life in the World. Those who put far from
them the evil day, and live in the pursuit of lusts
and pleasures, have somewhat that gives them
present satisfaction, and they say not, There is no
hope, because they find the Life of the hand:
But you have nothing that gives you any preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58587:111"/>
Refreshment, neither will your latter end be
better than theirs, if you dye without an Interest
in Christ Jesus. Come therefore at length unto
a determinate Resolution what you will do in this
matter. Christ hath waited long for you, and
who knows how soon he may withdraw, never to
look after you any more.</p>
               <p>UPON occasion of the preceding Discourse
concerning the Glory of Christ, I thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to add unto it this brief Exhortation unto
Faith in him, aiming to suit it unto the Capacity of
the meanest Sinner that is capable of any self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
as unto his Eternal Welfare. But yet
a little further, to give efficacy unto this Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
it will be necessary to remove some of
those common and obvious Tergiversations that
convinced Sinners do usually betake themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
to put off a present compliance with the calls
of Christ to come unto him; for although it is
Unbelief alone acting in the darkness of mens minds
and the obstinacy of their Wills, that effectually
keeps off Sinners from coming unto Christ upon
his Call, yet it shrouds it self under various pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
that it may not appear in it's own ugly
Form; for no Sin, whereof Men can be guilty of
in this World, is of so horrible a Nature, and so
dreadful an Aspect as is this Unbelief, where a
clear view of it is obtained in Evangelical Light:
wherefore by the aid of Satan, it suggests other
pleas and pretences unto the Minds of Sinners, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which they may countenance themselves in a
Refusal to come to Christ; see 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. Any
thing else it shall be, but not Unbelief, that they
all disavow. I shall therefore speak unto a few
of those Tergiversations in this case which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58587:111"/>
and which are exemplified in the Gospel
it self.</p>
               <p>I. SOME do say on such Exhortations: What
is it that you would have us to do? We hear the
Word preached, we believe it as well as we can,
we do many things willingly, and abstain from
many evils diligently, what is more required of
us? This is the Language of the Hearts of the
most with whom in this Case we have to do:
And I say,</p>
               <p>1. IT is usual with them who do something in
the ways of God, but not all they should, and so
nothing in a due manner, to expostulate about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
of them more than they do. So the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
dispute with God himself, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 6. Chap.
3. 8, 13. So they in the Gospel who esteemed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to have done their Duty, being pressed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Faith by Christ Jesus, ask him with some Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<hi>What shall we do, that we might work the work
of God?</hi> John 6. 28. If what we do be not enough,
what is it that you require more of us? So was
it with the Young Man, <hi>Mat. 19. 20. What do I
lack yet?</hi> Be advised therefore not to be too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of your State, left you should yet lack that
one thing, the want whereof might prove your
Eternal Ruine.</p>
               <p>2. THE things mentioned, with all of the like
nature, which may be multiplied, may be where
there is no one spark of saving Faith. <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
heard the Word, and believed as well as he
could; <hi>Herod</hi> heard it, and did many things glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and all sorts of Hypocrites do upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
perform many duties, and abstain from
many sins, so as that notwithstanding this plea you
may perish for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:58587:112"/>
3. WHERE these things are sincere, they
belong unto the exercise of Faith; they may be
after a sort without Faith, but Faith cannot be
without them: But there is a fundamental Act of
Faith, whereby we close with Christ, whereby we
receive him; that is, in order of Nature, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
unto it's actings in all other Duties and Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
it is laying the foundation, other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the building. This is that you are called
on to secure, and you may know it by these two
Properties:</p>
               <p>1. It is <hi>Singular:</hi> So our Saviour tells the <hi>Jews,
Joh. 6. 29. This is the work of God, that you believe
on him whom he hath sent.</hi> The Act, Work or Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Faith in the receiving of Christ, is a peculiar
singular Work, wherein the Soul yields especial
obedience unto God: It is not to be reckoned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such common Duties as those mentioned, but
the Soul must find out wherein it hath in a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
manner closed with Christ upon the Command
of God.</p>
               <p>2. IT is accompanied with an universal Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Change in the whole Soul, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 17. If any
man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are
passed away, behold all things are become new:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if you would not chuse rather to deceive and
ruine your own Souls, come to the tryal whether
indeed you have received Christ in such a singular
transforming act of Faith, do not on such preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
want a compliance with the word of Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
proposed unto you. But</p>
               <p>II. SOME will say, they know not how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in this Work. They can make nothing of
it; they have tryed to come to this believing,
but do still fail in what they design; they go on
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58587:112"/>
and off, but can make no progress, can come
to no satisfaction; therefore they think it best to
let things go in general as they are, without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themselves to farther trouble as unto any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>special
Act of Faith in the receiving of Christ.
This is the language of Mens Hearts, though not
of their mouths, another shelter of Unbelief, and
they act accordingly; they have a secret Despon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
which keeps them safe from attempting a
real closure with Christ on the tender of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel:
Something may be offered unto this distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
frame of Mind.</p>
               <p>1. REMEMBER the Disciples that were
fishing, and had toiled all night, but caught no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 3, 4; upon the coming of Christ
unto them, he requires that they should cast out
their Nets once more; <hi>Peter</hi> makes some excuse
from the labour which they had taken in vain all
Night; however he would venture once more on
the Command of Christ, and had an astonishing
draught of Fishes, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Have you bin
wearied with disappointments in your attempts and
Resolutions, yet cast in your Net this once more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Command of Christ, venture this once more
to come unto him on his Call and Invitation, you
know not what success he may give unto you.</p>
               <p>2. CONSIDER that it is not failing in this
or that Attempt of coming to Christ, but a giving
over your Endeavours that will be your Ruine.
The Woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> in her great outcry to
Christ for Mercy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 22. had many a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse:
First it is said, he answered her not a word,
then his Disciples desired that he would send her
away, that she might not trouble him any more;
whereon he gives a Reason why he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58587:113"/>
her, or why he could justly pass her by; she
was not an <hi>Israelitess,</hi> unto whom he was sent, yet
she gives not over, but pressing into his presence,
cries out for Mercy, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. being come to
that issue, to try and draw out her Faith to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
which was his design from the beginning,
he reckons her among Dogs, that were not to
have Childrens bread given unto them. Had she
now at last given over upon this severe Rebuke,
she had never obtained Mercy; but persisting in
her Request she at last prevailed, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. 28. It
may be you have prayed, and cryed, and resolved, and
vowed, but all without success as you suppose, Sin
hath broken thorough all: however, if you give not
over, you shall prevail at last; you know not at
what time God will come in with his Grace, and
Christ will manifest his love unto you as unto the
poor Woman, after many a rebuke. It may be
after all he will do it this day, and if not, he may
do it another, do not despond. Take that word
of Christ himself for your Encouragement, <hi>Prov.</hi>
8. 34. <hi>Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching
daily at my Gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</hi>
If you hear him, and wait, though you have not
yet admission, but are kept at the gates and posts
of the doors, yet in the issue you shall be blessed.</p>
               <p>3. THE Rule in this case is, <hi>Hos. 6 3. Then
shall we know, if we follow on to know.</hi> Are you in
the way of knowing Christ in the use of Means,
hearing the Word, and sincere Endeavours in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Duties; though you cannot yet attain unto any
Evidence that you have received him, have closed
with him, nothing can ruine you but giving o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the way wherein you are; for then shall you
know, if you follow on to know the Lord. Many
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58587:113"/>
can give you their Experiences, that if they had
been discouraged by present overwhelming Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
arising from their Disappointments, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Vows, relapses into Folly, they had been
utterly ruined, whereas now they are at rest and
peace in the Bosom of Christ. On a great surprizal
Christ lost at once many Disciples, and they lost
their Souls, <hi>John 6. 66. They went back, and walked
no more with him;</hi> take heed of the like Discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements.</p>
               <p>III. SOME may say, yea, practically they
do say, That these things indeed are necessary;
they must come to Christ by believing, or they
are undone, but this is not the season of it, there
will be time enough to apply themselves unto it
when other occasions are past. At present they
have not leisure to enter upon, and go through
with this Duty: wherefore they will abide in their
present State for a while, hearing and doing many
things, and when time serves, will apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unto this Duty also.</p>
               <p>1. THIS is an uncontrollable evidence of that
Sottishness and Folly which is come upon our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
by Sin. A Depravation that the Apostle pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the head of the Evils of corrupted Nature,
<hi>Tu.</hi> 3. 3. Can any thing be more foolish, sottish
and stupid, than for men to put off the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Eternal Concernment of their Souls
for one hour, being altogether uncertain whether
they shall live another or no? to preferr present
Trifles before the Blessedness or Misery of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
State? For those who never heard of these
things, who never had any Conviction of Sin and
Judgment, to put the evil day far from them, is
not much to be admired: But for you who have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58587:114"/>
Christ preached unto you, who own a necessity of
coming unto him, to put it off from day to day
upon such slight pretences, it is an astonishable
Folly. May you not be spoken unto in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the Wisdom of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 9, 10, 11.
You come to hear the Word, and when you go
away, the language of your Hearts is; <hi>Yet a little
sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to
sleep:</hi> We will abide a little while in our present
State, and afterwards we will rouze up our selves.
Under this Deceit do multitudes perish every day.
This is a dark Shade, wherein cursed Unbelief
lyes hid.</p>
               <p>2. CONSIDER that this is the greatest En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that Satan makes use of in the World among
them that hear the Word preached unto them,
for the ruine of their Souls. He hath other Arts
and Ways, and Methods of dealing with other
Men, as by sensual and worldly Lusts: But as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them who through their Convictions do attend
unto the preaching of the Word, this is his great
and almost only Engine for their Ruine. There
needs no haste in this matter, another time will
be more seasonable, you may be sure not to fail
of it before you dye: However, this present day
and time is most unfit for it, you have other things
to do, you cannot part with your present frame,
you may come again to hear the Word the next
opportunity. Know assuredly, if your Minds are
influenced unto delays of coming to Christ by such
insinuations, you are under the Power of Satan,
and he is like enough to hold you fast unto De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
               <p>3. THIS is as evil and dangerous a Posture,
or frame of Mind, as you can well fall under. If
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58587:114"/>
you have learned to put off God, and Christ, and
the Word for the present Season, and yet relieve
your selves in this, that you do not intend like
others alwayes to reject them, but will have a
time to hearken to their calls; you are secured
and fortified against all Convictions and Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
all fears; one answer will serve for all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a little while you will do all that can be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of you. This is that which ruines the Souls
of multitudes every day. It is better dealing with
Men openly profligate, than with such a trifling
promiser. See <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 7, 10.</p>
               <p>4. REMEMBER that the Scripture confines
you unto the present day, without the least inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
that you shall have either another day, or
another tender of Grace and Mercy in any day,
2 <hi>Cor. 6. 2. Heb. 3. 7. 13. Chap.</hi> 12. 15. Take care
lest you come short of the Grace of God, miss of
it by missing your opportunity. Redeem the time,
or you are lost for ever.</p>
               <p>5. AS unto the pretence of your Occasions and
Business, there is a ready way to disappoint the
craft of Satan in that pretence, namely, to mix
Thoughts of Christ, and the Renovation of your
Resolutions, either to come or to cleave unto him
with all your Occasions. Let nothing put it ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
out of your minds; make it familiar unto
you, and you will beat Satan out of that strong
hold, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 4. However, shake your selves out
of this dust, or destruction lyes at the door.</p>
               <p>IV. IT is the Language of the Hearts of some,
that if they give up themselves unto a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with this Exhortation, and go seriously about
this Duty, they must relinquish and renounce all
their Lusts and pleasures, yea much of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58587:115"/>
and Society, wherein they find so much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
satisfaction, as that they know not how to
part with them. If they might retain their old
ways, at least some of them, it were another mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but this total Relinquishment of all is very
severe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I. THE <hi>Jesuites</hi> preaching and painting
of Christ among some of the <hi>Indians,</hi> concealed
from them his Cross and Sufferings, telling them
only of his present Glory and Power; so as they
pretended to win them over to Faith in him, hiding
from them that whereby they might be discouraged;
and so preached a false Christ unto them, one of their
own framing. We dare do no such thing for all
the World; we can here use no condescention,
no compliance, no composition with respect unto
any Sin or Lust, we have no Commission to grant
that request of <hi>Lot, Is it not a little one? let it be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;</hi>
nor to come to <hi>Naamans</hi> terms, <hi>God be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to me in this thing, in all others I will be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</hi>
Wherefore,</p>
               <p>2. WE must here be peremptory with you,
whatever be the event, if you are discouraged by
it, we cannot help it; Cursed be the Man that
shall encourage you to come to Christ, with hopes
of Indulgence unto any one Sin whatever. I speak
not this, as though you could at once absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and perfectly leave all Sin in the root and
branches of it; but only you are to do it in Heart
and Resolution, engaging into an Universal Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of all Sin, as by Grace from above
you shall be enabled: But your Choice must be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
without Reserves, as to Love, Interest and
Design; God or the World, Christ or <hi>Belial,</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58587:115"/>
or Sin, there is no Medium, no terms of
composition, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>3. AS unto what you pretend of your Pleasures,
the Truth is, you never yet had any real Pleasure,
nor do know what it is: How easie were it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the folly, vanity, bitterness, poyson of those
things which you have esteemed your pleasures. Here
alone, namely, in Christ, and a participation of
him, are true Pleasures, and durable Riches to be
obtained; Pleasure of the same Nature with, and
such as like pleasant Streams flow down into
the Ocean of Eternal Pleasures above. A few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in these Joys are to be preferred above the
longest continuance in the cursed pleasures of this
World. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>V. IT will be said by some, that they do not
see those who profess themselves to be Believers,
to be so much better than they are, as that you
need to press us so earnestly to so great a change;
we know not why we should not be accounted
Believers already as well as they. I shall in a few
words, as well as I am able, lay this stumbling-block
out of the way, though I confess at this day
it is weighty and cumbersome. And I say.</p>
               <p>1. AMONG them that profess themselves to
be Believers, there are many false, corrupt Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites;
and it is no wonder that on various oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
they lay the stumbling-block of their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
before the faces of others: But they shall
bear their own burthen and Judgment.</p>
               <p>2. IT is acknowledged, it must be bewailed,
that some whom we have reason to judge to be true
Believers, yet through their unmortified Pride,
or Covetousness, or Carelesness in their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
or vain Attire, and conformity to the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58587:116"/>
World, or Frowardness, do give just occasion of
offence. We confess that God is displeased here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
Christ and the Gospel dishonour'd, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that are weak are wounded, and others discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.
But as for you, this is not your Rule;
this is not proposed unto you, but that Word on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is so that will never fail you.</p>
               <p>3. THE World doth not know, nor is able
to make a right Judgment of Believers; nor do
you so, for it is the Spiritual Man alone that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
the things of God. Their Infirmities are
visible to all, their Graces invisible; the King's
Daughter is glorious within. And when you are
able to make a right Judgment of them, you will
desire no greater Advancement than to be of their
Society, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 3.</p>
               <p>THESE few Instances of the pretences where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Unbelief covers it's Deformity, and hides
that destruction wherewith it is accompanied, may
suffice unto our present purpose; they are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
in the minds of Men, impregnated by the
suggestions of Satan on their Darkness and Folly.
A little Spiritual Wisdom will rend the vail of them
all, and expose Unbelief acting in Enmity against
Christ under them. But what hath been spoken
may suffice to answer the necessity of the preceding
Exhortaion on this Occasion.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Way and Means of the Recovery of
Spiritual Decayes, and of obtaining fresh
Springs of Grace.</head>
               <p>THE Application of the same Truth in the
Second place belongs unto <hi>Believers,</hi> especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
such as have made any long profession of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the ways of God and the Gospel. And that
which I design herein, is to manifest, That a stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Spiritual view of the Glory of Christ by Faith,
will give them a gracious Revival from inward
Decayes, and fresh Springs of Grace, even in
their latter days. A Truth this is, as we shall see
confirmed by Scripture, with the joyful Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of multitudes of Believers, and is of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
unto all that are so.</p>
               <p>THERE are two things, which those who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a long profession of the Gospel are entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Confines of Eternity, do long for and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.
The one is, that all their Breaches may be
repaired, their Decays recovered, their Backsli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
healed: For unto these things they have been
less or more obnoxious in the course of their
walking before God. The other is, that they
may have fresh Springs of Spiritual Life, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
actings of all Divine Graces, in Spiritual
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58587:117"/>
Mindedness, Holiness, and Fruitfulness, unto the
praise of God, the honour of the Gospel, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of their own Peace and Joy. These things
they value more than all the World, and all that
is in it; about these things are their Thoughts
and Contrivances exercised night and day. Those
with whom it is otherwise, whatever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
are in the dark unto themselves, and their
own Condition: For it is in the Nature of this
Grace to grow and encrease unto the end. As
Rivers, the nearer they come unto the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
whither they tend, the more they increase
their waters, and speed their streams: So will
Grace flow more freely and fully in it's near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
to the Ocean of Glory. That is not
saving which doth not so.</p>
               <p>AN experience hereof, I mean of the thriving
of Grace towards the end of our Course, is that
alone which can support us under the Troubles
and Temptations of Life, which we have to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
withal. So the Apostle tells us, that this
is our great Relief in all our Distresses and
Afflictions, whereon <hi>me faint not, that as our
outer man doth perish, so the inner man is renewed day
by day,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 16. If it be so, that in the daily
Decays of the outward man, in all the Approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of it's Dissolution, we have inward Spiritual
Revivals and Renovation, we shall not faint in
what we undergo. And without such continual
Renovations, we shall faint in our Distresses,
whatever other things we may have, or whatever
we pretend unto the contrary.</p>
               <p>AND ordinarily it is so in the Holy, Wise
Providence of God, that Afflictions and Troubles
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58587:117"/>
increase with Age. It is so in an especial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
with Ministers of the Gospel; they have
many of them a share in the lot of <hi>Peter,</hi>
which our Lord Jesus Christ declared unto him,
<hi>John 21. 18. When thou wast young, thou girdedst thy
self, and walkedst whither thou wouldst; but when thou
shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and
another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou
wouldst not.</hi> Besides those natural Distempers and
Infirmities which accompany the decays of Life,
Troubles of Life, and in their Affairs do usually
grow upon them, when they look for nothing
less, but were ready to say with <hi>Job, We shall
dye in our nest,</hi> Job 29. 18. So was it with <hi>Jacob,</hi>
after all his hard Labour and Travel to provide
for his Family, such things fell out in it in his
Old Age, as had almost broken his Heart: And
oft times both Persecutions and Publick Dangers
do befall them at the same season. Whilst the
outward man is thus perishing, we need great sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
that we faint not. And this is only to
be had in an Experience of daily Spiritual Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
in the inner man.</p>
               <p>THE Excellency of this Mercy the Psalmist ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
in an Heavenly manner, <hi>Psal.</hi> 92. 12, 13,
14, 15. <hi>The Righteous shall flourish like the Palm-tree,
be shall grow like the Cedar in Lebanon: Those that
be planted in the house of the Lord, shall flourish in the
Courts of our God; they shall bring forth fruit in old
Age, they shall be fat and flourishing. To shem that
the Lord is upright; be is my Rock, and there is no
unrighteousness in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Promise in the <hi>12th.</hi> verse, respects the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58587:118"/>
times of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> or of the New Testament, for so
it is prophesied of him; <hi>In his days the Righteous shall
flourish,</hi> Psal. 72. 7. namely, through the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Grace that should be administred from
his fulness, as <hi>Joh. 1. 16. Col. 1. 19.</hi> And herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
the Glory of the Gospel, and not in outward
Prosperity, or External Ornaments of Divine
Worship. The flourishing of the Righteous, I
say, in Grace and Holiness, is the Glory of the
Office of Christ, and of the Gospel. Where this
is not, there is no Glory in the profession of our
Religion. The Glory of Kings is in the Wealth
and Peace of their Subjects; and the Glory of
Christ is in the Grace and Holiness of his
Subjects.</p>
               <p>THIS <hi>flourishing</hi> is compared to the <hi>Palm-tree,</hi>
and the Growth of the <hi>Cedar.</hi> The <hi>Palm-tree</hi> is of
the greatest Verdure, Beauty, and Fruitfulness,
and the <hi>Cedar</hi> of the greatest and longest growth
of any Trees. So are the <hi>Righteous</hi> compared to
the <hi>Palm-tree,</hi> for the Beauty of Profession, and
Fruitfulness in Obedience; and unto the <hi>Cedar</hi> for
a continual constant growth and encrease in Grace.
Thus it is with all that are righteous, unless it be
from their own sinful neglect, as it is with many in this
day. They are hereon rather like the <hi>Shrubs</hi> and
<hi>Heaths in the Wilderness, which see not when Good
cometh,</hi> than like the <hi>Palm-tree,</hi> or the <hi>Cedars of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon.</hi>
And hereby do Men what lies in them,
obscure the Glory of Christ and his Kingdom, as
well as disquiet their own Souls.</p>
               <p>THE words that follow, <hi>ver. 13. They that be
planted in the house of the Lord, shall flourish in the
Courts of our God,</hi> are not distinctive of some from
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58587:118"/>
other, as though some only of the flourishing
Righteous were so planted; but they are descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of them all, with an addition of the way and
means whereby they are caused so to grow and
flourish. And this is their Implantation in the
House of the Lord; that is, in the Church, which
is the seat of all the means of Spiritual Life, both
as unto growth and flourishing, which God is
pleased to grant unto Believers. To be planted
in the House of the Lord, is to be fixed and root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Grace communicated by the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Divine Worship. Unless we are planted
in the house of the Lord, we cannot flourish in his
Courts: see <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 3. Unless we are partakers of
the Grace administred in the Ordinances, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
flourish in a fruitful Profession. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
participation of them is common unto Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
that bear some leaves, but neither grow
like the Cedar, nor bear fruit like the Palm-tree.
So the Apostle prays for Believers, that Christ
may dwell in their Hearts by Faith, that they may
<hi>be rooted and grounded in love,</hi> Ephes. 3. 17. <hi>Rooted,
built up, and established,</hi> Col. 2. 7. The want here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is the cause that we have so many fruitless
Professors; they have entred the Courts of God by
Profession, but were never planted in his House by
Faith and Love. Let us not deceive our selves
herein; we may be entred into the Church, and
made partakers of the outward Priviledges of it,
and not be so planted in it as to flourish in Grace
and Fruitfulness.</p>
               <p>THAT which on this Occasion I principally
intend, is the Grace and Priviledge expressed <hi>ver.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58587:119"/>
14th. They shall still bring forth fruit in old Age, they
shall be fat and flourishing.</hi> There be three things
which constitute a Spiritual State, or belong to
the Life of God. (1.) That Believers be fat, that
is, by the Heavenly Juice, Sap, or Fatness of the
true Olive, of Christ himself; as <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. This
is the principle of Spiritual Life and Grace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from him. When this abounds in them so
as to give them strength and vigour in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of Grace, to keep them from decays and
withering, they are said to be fat, which in the
Scripture Phrase is strong and healthy. (2.) That
they flourish in the Greenness (as the word is)
and Verdure of Profession; for vigorous Grace will
produce a flourishing Profession. (3.) That they
still bring forth Fruit in all Duties of Holy Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
All these are promised unto them even in
Old Age.</p>
               <p>EVEN Trees when they grow old (the Palm
and the Cedar) are apt to lose of their Juice and
Verdure: and men in Old Age are subject unto
all sorts of Decays both outward and inward. It
is a rare thing to see a Man in Old Age naturally
vigorous, healthy and strong; and would it were
not more rare to see any Spiritually so at the
same Season: But this is here promised unto
Believers as an especial Grace and Priviledge,
beyond what can be represented in the growth
or fruit-bearing of Plants and Trees.</p>
               <p>THE Grace intended, is, That when Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
are under all sorts of bodily and Natural
Decays, and it may be have been overtaken with
Spiritual Decays also, there is provision made in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58587:119"/>
the Covenant, to render them fat, flourishing
and fruitful, vigorous in the power of Internal
Grace, and flourishing in the expression of it in
all Duties of Obedience, which is that which we
now enquire after.</p>
               <p>BLESSED be God for this good Word of
his Grace, that he hath given us such encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against all the Decays and Temptations of
Old Age which we have to conflict withall.</p>
               <p>AND the Psalmist in the next words declares
the greatness of this Priviledge: <hi>To shem that the
Lord is upright; he is my Rock, there is no unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
in him.</hi> Consider the oppositions that
lye against the flourishing of Believers in Old Age,
the Difficulties of it, the Temptations that must
be conquered, the Actings of the Mind above it's
natural Abilities which are decayed, the weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that is apt to befall us in a long Spiritual
conflict, the cries of the Flesh to be spared, and
we shall see it to be an Evidence of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
Power and Righteousness of God in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
nothing else could produce this mighty
effect. So the Prophet treating of the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
<hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. closeth his Discourse
with that blessed Remark, <hi>Ver. 9. Who is wise,
and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he
shall know them? for the ways of the Lord are right,
and the just shall walk in them.</hi> Spiritual Wisdom
will make us to see that the Faithfulness and
Power of God are exerted in this work of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
Believers flourishing and fruitful unto
the End.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:58587:120"/>
HAVING laid the Foundation of this illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Testimony, I shall farther declare and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
my Intention, so to make way for the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the Truth under Consideration unto
this Case, manifesting, that the way whereby we
may be made partakers of this Grace, is by a stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
view of the Glory of Christ, as proposed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us in the Gospel.</p>
               <p>TRERE is a latter Spring in the Year, a
Spring in Autumn: it is indeed for the most part
but faint and weak, yet is it such as the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman
cannot spare. And it is an evident sign
of Barren ground, when it doth not put forth
afresh towards the end of the Year. God the good
Husbandman looks for the same from us, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if we had a Summers drought in Spiritual
Decays; as the Psalmist complains, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 4.
Had we not had a latter Spring the last Year,
the Land had greatly suffered under the drought
of the Summer. And if we have had such a
drought in the Course of our Profession by Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Decays, as God the good Husbandman looks
for a latter Spring in us, even in old Age, in the
vigorous acting of Grace and fruitful Obedience:
So without it we can neither have Peace nor Joy
in our own Souls. If a Man therefore hath made
a great Appearance of Religion in his former or
younger days, and when he is growing into Age
becomes dead, cold, worldly, selfish; if he have
no fresh Springs of Spiritual Life in him, it is an
Evidence that he hath a barren Heart, that was
never really fruitful to God. I know that many
stand in need of being excited by such warning,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58587:120"/>
unto a diligent consideration of their State and
Condition.</p>
               <p>IT is true, that the latter Spring doth not
bring forth the same Fruit with the former. There
is no more required in it, but that the Ground evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
it self to be in good heart, and to put
forth that which is proper unto the Season. It
may be such Graces as were active and vigorous
in Men at their first Conversion unto God, as
were carried in a stream of warm natural Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
may not so eminently abound in the latter
Spring of old Age: But those which are proper
for the Season, as namely, Spirituality, Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mindedness, weanedness from the World, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
for the Cross, and Death, are necessary,
even in old Age, to evidence that we have a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Principle of Grace, and to shew thereby that
God is upright, he is our Rock, and there is no
unrighteousness in him.</p>
               <p>WHAT is further to be insisted on, shall be
reduced unto these four Heads.</p>
               <p>1. THAT the constitution of Spiritual Life,
is such as is meet to thrive, grow and encrease
unto the end, and will do so, unless it be from the
default of them in whom it is.</p>
               <p>2. THAT notwithstanding this Nature and
Constitution of Spiritual Life, yet Believers are
subject unto many Decays, partly gradual, and
partly by Surprizals in Temptation, whereby the
growth of it is obstructed unto the dishonour of
the Gospel, and the loss of their own Peace with
Joy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:58587:121"/>
3. I shall shew that such at present is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of many Professors, namely, that they are
visibly fallen under Spiritual Decays, and do not
evidence any Interest in the blessed Promise insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on.</p>
               <p>4. ON the Confirmation of these things, our
Enquiry will be, how such Persons may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from such Decays, and by what means they
may obtain the Grace here promised, of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
flourishing in old Age, both in the strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the inward Principle of Life, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
in Fruits of Obedience, which are to
the praise of God by Jesus Christ: And then we
shall make Application unto this case, of that
Truth which is the Subject of the preceding
Discourse.</p>
               <p>1. THE Constitution of Spiritual Life is such,
as is meet to grow and increase unto the end.
Hereby it doth distinguish it self from that Faith
which is Temporary; for there is a Temporary
Faith which will both flourish for a Season, and
bring forth some Fruit, but it is not in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Constitution to abide, to grow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
but rather to decay and wither. It is
described by our Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 20,
21. either some great Temptation extinguisueth
it, or it decays insensibly, until the mind where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it was do manifest it self to be utterly barren.
And therefore whoever is sensible of any Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Decays, he is called unto a sevcre Trial and
Examination of himself, as unto the Nature of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58587:121"/>
the Principle of his Profession and Obedience;
for such Decays do rather argue a principle of
Temporary Faith only, unto which they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and natural, than that whose Nature it is to
thrive and grow to the end, whereon those that
have it, shall as it is in the Promise, still bring
forth fruit, and without their own great Guilt
be always freed from such Decays.</p>
               <p>THAT this Spiritual Life is in it's Nature
and Constitution such as will abide, thrive and
grow to the end, is three ways testified unto in
the Scripture.</p>
               <p>1. IN that it is compared unto things of the
most infallible increase and Progress: For besides
that, it's growth is frequently likened unto that
of Plants and Trees well watered, and in a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Soil, which fail not to spring, unless it be
from some external violence; it is likewise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
unto such things as whose progress is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
infallible, <hi>Prov. 4. 18. The path of the just is
as the shining light, that shineth more and more to
the perfect day.</hi> The path of the Just is his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-walk
before God, as it is frequently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the Scripture, <hi>Psal. 119. 35. 105. Isa.
26. 7. Psal. 23. 3. Mat. 3. 3. Heb.</hi> 12. 13. and it
comprizeth the Principle, Profession, and Fruits
of it. This, faith the Wise Man, is as the shining
Light; that is, the Morning Light: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is it so? Why, as that goeth on by Degrees,
and shineth more and more unto the high Noon;
(though it may be interrupted sometimes by
Clouds and Storms:) So is this Path of the Just,
it goes on and increaseth unto the high Noon,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58587:122"/>
the perfect Day of Glory. It is in it's Nature
so to do, though it may sometimes meet with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
as we shall see afterwards; and so doth
the Morning light also.</p>
               <p>THERE is no visible difference as unto Light,
between the Light of the Morning, and the Light
of the Evening; yea, this latter sometimes from
gleams of the Setting Sun, seems to be more
Glorious than the other. But herein they differ;
the first goes on gradually unto more Light, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
it comes to perfection; the other gradually
gives place unto Darkness, until it comes to be
Mid-night. So is it as unto the Light of the Just
and of the Hypocrite, and so is it as unto their
Paths. At first setting out they may seem alike and
equal; yea, Convictions and Spiritual Gifts acted
with corrupt ends in some Hypocrites, may for
a time give a greater lustre of Profession than the
Grace of others sincerely Converted unto God
may attain unto. But herein they discover their
different Natures; the one increaseth and goeth
on constantly, though it may be sometimes but
faintly; the other decays, grows dim, gives place
to darkness and crooked walking.</p>
               <p>THIS then is the Nature of the path of the
Just: And where it is otherwise with us in our
Walk before God, we can have no Evidence that
we are in that Path, or that we have a living,
growing Principle of Spiritual Life in us. And
it is fit that Professors of all sorts should be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of these things; for we may see not a few of
them under visible Decays, without any sincere
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58587:122"/>
endeavours after a Recovery, who yet please
themselves that the root of the matter is in them.
It is so, if Love of the World, Conformity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, negligence in Holy Duties, and coldness
in Spiritual Love be an Evidence of such Decays.
But let none deceive their own Souls, wherever
there is a saving Principle of Grace, it will be
thriving and growing unto the end. And if
it fall under Obstructions, and thereby into
Decays for a Season, it will give no rest or qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etness
unto the Soul wherein it is, but will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
continually for a Recovery. Peace in a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
decaying condition, is a Soul-ruining Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity;
better be under terror on the account of
surprizal into some Sin, than be in peace under
evident Decays of Spiritual Life.</p>
               <p>AND by the way, this comparing of the Path
of the Just unto the Morning Light, minds me
of what I have seen more than once. That Light
hath sometimes chearfully appeared unto the
World, when after a little season by reason of
Clouds, Tempests and Storms; it hath given place
again to Darkness, like that of the Night; but it
hath not so been lost and buried like the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Light; after a while it hath recovered it self
unto a greater lustre than before, manifesting
that it increased in it self whilst it was eclipsed as
to us. So hath it been with not a few at their
first Conversion unto God, great Darkness and
Trouble have by the Efficacy of Temptation, and
Injections of Satan possessed their minds: But the
Grace which they have received being as the
Morning Light, hath after a while disentangled
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58587:123"/>
it self, and given Evidence, that it was so far
from being extinguished, as that it grew and
thrived under all those Clouds and Darkness;
For the Light of the Just doth in the issue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
increase by Temptations, as that of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
is constantly impaired by them.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, As it is as the Morning Light, than
which nothing hath a more assured Progress; so
it is called by our Saviour <hi>Living water,</hi> Joh. 4.
10. yea, a <hi>Well of water, springing up unto Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Life,</hi> ver. 14. It is an indeficient Spring,
not a Pool or Pond, though never so large,
which may be dryed up. Many such Pools of
Light, Gifts, and Profession, have we seen utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dryed up, when they have come into Age, or
been ensnared by the Temptations of the World.
And we may see others every day under dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
decays; their Countenances are changed,
and they have lost that Oyl which makes the
face of a Believer to shine, namely, the Oyl of
Love, Meekness, Self-denial, and Spirituality of
Converse; and instead thereof there is spread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them the falsome Oyntment of Pride, Self-love,
Earthly-mindedness, which increaseth on
them more and more. But where this Principle
of Spiritual Life is, it is as the Morning Light,
as an indeficient Spring that never fails, nor can
do so, untill it issue in Eternal Life: and sundry
other ways there are whereby the same Truth is
asserted in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>2. THERE are sundry Divine Promises given
unto Believers, that so it shall be, or to secure
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58587:123"/>
them of such supplies of Grace as shall cause
their Spiritual Life to grow, increase, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
unto the end, such as that in the Psalm
which we have considered: For these Promises
are the Means whereby this Spiritual Life is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
communicated unto us, and whereby it is
preserved in us; by them are we made partakers
of this Divine Nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. and through
them is it continued in us. Now Promises of this
Nature, namely, that by the Dispensation of the
Spirit of Christ, and supplies of his Grace, our
Spiritual Life shall flourish, and be made fruitful
to the end, I shall briefly call over one of them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at present, which is recorded <hi>Isa. 44. 3, 4. I
will pour water on him that is thirsty, and floods upon the
dry ground; I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and
my blessing upon thine Off-spring; and they shall spring
up as among the Grass, as willows by the water courses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ALTHOUGH this Promise may have respect
unto the Gracious dealing of God with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the <hi>Jews</hi> after their Return from the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
yet hath it so only as it was Typical of
the Redemption of the Church by Jesus Christ:
But it belongs properly to the Times of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
when the Righteous were to flourish, and it
is a Promise of the New Covenant, as is manifest,
in that it is not only given unto Believers, but is
also extended unto their Seed and Off-spring, which
is an assured Signature of New Covenant Promises.
And here is, (1.) A supposition of what we are
in our selves, both before and after our Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto God, namely, as thirsty, dry, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
Ground. We have nothing in our selves, no
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58587:124"/>
radical moisture to make us flourishing and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
And as it is before, so it is after Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<hi>We are not sufficient of our selves, our sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5. Being left to our selves,
we should utterly wither and perish. But, (2.) Here
is the blessed Relief which God in this Case
hath provided; he will pour the sanctifying Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his Spirit, and the Blessing of his Grace
upon us. And this he will so do, as to cause us
to spring up as among the Grass, as Willows by
the water courses. There is nothing of a more
eminent and almost visible growth, than Willows
by the water courses. Such shall be the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
growth of Believers under the Influences of
these Promises; that is, they shall be fat and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing,
and still bring forth fruit. And other
Promises of the same Nature there are many;
but we must observe two things concerning them,
that we may be satisfied in their Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
As,</p>
               <p>1. THE Promises of the New Covenant, as
unto the first Communication of Grace unto the
Elect, are absolute and inconditional; they are
the executive conveyances of Gods immutable Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
and Decrees: And what should be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Communication of the first Grace
unto us? Nothing that is not Grace can be so.
If it be said, that this also is of God in us, which
is the Condition of the Communication of the first
Saving Grace unto us, then I would know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that be bestowed on us without any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
if it be, then that is the first Grace, as
being absolutely free; if it be not, then what is
the Condition whereon it is bestowed, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58587:124"/>
which the same Enquiry must be made, and
so for ever? But this is the Glory of Convenant
Promises, that as unto the Communication of the
Grace of Conversion and Sanctification unto the
Elect, they are absolutely free and incondition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate:
But,</p>
               <p>2. THE Promises which respect the Growth,
Degrees and Measures of this Grace in Believers
are not so. There are many Duties required of
us, that these Promises may be accomplished
towards us, and in us; yea, watchful Diligence
in Universal Gospel Obedience is expected from
us unto this end: See 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
This is the ordinary Method of the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all supplies of Grace to make us spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
flourish, and be fruitful, namely, that we be
found in the diligent exercise of what we have
received. God doth sometimes deal otherwise in
a way of Soveraignty, and surprizeth men with
healing Grace in the midst of their Decays and
Backslidings, as <hi>Isaiah</hi> 57. 17, 18. So hath many
a poor Soul been delivered from going down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Pit. The good Shepherd will go out of
his way to save a wandring sheep; but this is the
ordinary method.</p>
               <p>3. NOTWITHSTANDING these blessed
Promises of Growth, Flourishing, and Fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
if we are negligent in the due Improvment
of the Grace which we have received, and the
discharge of the Duties required of us, we may
fall into Decays, and be kept in a low, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifty
state all our days. And this is the principal
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58587:125"/>
ground of the Discrepancy between the Glory
and Beauty of the Church, as represented in the
Promises of the Gospel, and as exemplified in the
Lives and walking of Professors, they do not live
up unto the Condition of their accomplishment in
them; howbeit, in Gods way and time they shall
be all fulfilled. We have therefore innumerable
blessed Promises concerning the thriving, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and flourishing of the Principle of Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Life in us even in old Age, and until Death:
But the Grace promised unto this end, will not
befall us whilst we are asleep in Spiritual Sloth
and Security. Fervent Prayer, the exercise of
all Grace received, with Watchfulness unto all
holy Duties, are required hereunto.</p>
               <p>3. GOD hath secured the Growth of this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Life, by the provision of Food for it,
whereby it may be strengthened and increased,
for Life must be preserved by Food. And this in
our Case is the Word of God, with all other
Ordinances of Divine Worship which depend
thereon, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2, 3. Whatever the state of this
Life be, whether in it's Beginning, it's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
its Decays, there is suitable nourishment
provided for it in the good Word of Gods
Grace. If Men will neglect their daily Food that
is provided for them, it is no wonder if they
be weak and thriftless. And if Believers are not
earnest in their desires after this Food, if they
are not diligent in providing of it, attending un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, much more if through Corruptions and
Temptations they count it in the preaching of it
light and common Food, which they do not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58587:125"/>
it is no wonder if they fall into Spiritual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays;
but God hath herein provided for our growth
even unto old Age.</p>
               <p>AND this is the first thing which was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
unto Confirmation, namely, that the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Nature of Spiritual Life is such, as to
be indeficient, so as to thrive and grow even in
old Age, and unto the end.</p>
               <p>THE Second thing proposed, is, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
this provision for the Growth of Spiritual Life
in us, Believers especially, in a long course of
Profession are subject to Decays, such as may cast
them into great Perplexities, and endanger their
Eternal Ruine.</p>
               <p>AND these Spiritual Decays are of two sorts:
(1.) Such as are gradual and universal, in the loss
of the vigour and Life of Grace, both in it's
Principle, and in it's Exercise. (2.) Such as are
occasioned by Surprizal into Sin through the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Temptation; I mean, such Sins as do waste
the Spiritual Powers of the Soul, and deprive it
of all solid peace.</p>
               <p>AS for Temporary Believers, give them but
time enough in this World, especially if it be
accompanied with outward Prosperity, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution;
and for the most part their Decays of
one sort or another will make a discovery of their
Hypocrisie. Though they retain a Form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
they deny the Power of it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 31.
And if they do not openly relinquish all Duties
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58587:126"/>
of Religion, yet they will grow so Lifeless and
favourless in them, as shall evidence their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for so it is with them who are lukewarm,
who are neither hot nor cold, who have a Name
to live, but are dead.</p>
               <p>AND herein lyeth a signal difference in this
matter, between sincere Believers, and those who
believe only for a time; for those of the latter
sort do either not perceive their Sickness and
Decays, their Minds being taken up and possessed
with other things; or if they do find that it is not
with them as it hath been formerly, they are not
much concerned, and on any occasional new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
they cry, Yet a little more slumber, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more sleep, a little more folding of the hands
to sleep: But when the other do find any thing
of this Nature, it makes them restless for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.
And although through the many Snares,
Temptations, and Deceits of Sin, or through
their Ignorance of the right way for their Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they do not many of them obtain a speedy
Recovery, yet none of them do approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in such a Condition, or turn unto any
undue Reliefs.</p>
               <p>NOW that Believers are subject to Decays
in both the ways mentioned, we have full Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
in Scripture: For as unto that general gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
Decay in the loss of our first Faith, Love,
and Works, in the weakening of the internal
Principle of Spiritual Life, with the loss thereon
of Delight, Joy and Consolation, and the Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Fruits of Obedience, our Lord Jesus
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58587:126"/>
Christ doth expresly charge it on five of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Churches of <hi>Asia, Rev.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. And in some of
them, as <hi>Sardis</hi> and <hi>Laodicea,</hi> those Decays had
proceeded unto such a degree, as that they were
in danger of utter Rejection: And hereunto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
the experience of all Churches, and all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
in the World. Those who are otherwise
minded, are dead in Sin, and have got pretences
to countenance themselves in their miserable
Condition. So is it with the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
and I wish others did not in some measure follow
them therein.</p>
               <p>AND as unto those of the Second sort, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
Men are cast by Surprizals and Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
producing great Spiritual Distress and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
of Soul, under a sense of God's displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
we have an instance in <hi>David,</hi> as he gives
us an account of himself, <hi>Psal. 38. verse</hi> 2. to the
<hi>10th. O Lord, thine Arrows stick fast in me, and
thy hand presseth me sore. There is no soundness in
my Flesh, because of thine Anger; neither is there
any rest in my Bones, because of my Sin: For mine
Iniquities are gone over my head, as an heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
they are too heavy for me. My Wounds stink
and are corrupt, because of my foolishness,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>IT is certain, that here is a description of a
very woful State and Condition: And the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
knowing that he was called of God to be
a Teacher and Instructer of the Church in all
Ages, records his own Experience unto that end.
Hence the Title of it is, <hi>A Psalm to bring to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance:</hi>
Some judge that <hi>David</hi> had respect
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58587:127"/>
unto some great and sore Disease that he was
then visited withall. But if it were so, it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an occasion of his Complaint; the cause of it
was Sin alone. And four things he doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
(1.) That he had departed from God,
and fallen into provoking Sins, which had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
great Distresses in his mind, <hi>verse</hi> 3, 4.
(2.) That he had foolishly continued in that State,
not making timely Application to Grace and
Mercy for healing, whereby it was grown deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<hi>ver.</hi> 5. And this Folly is that alone which
makes such a Condition dangerous; namely, when
Men on their Surprizals in Sin, do not speedily
apply themselves unto healing Remedies. (3.) That
he had herein a continual sense of the Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of God by reason of Sin, <hi>verse.</hi> 2. 3, 4.
(4.) That he was altogether restless in this State,
mourning, groaning, labouring continually for
Deliverance.</p>
               <p>THIS is a clearer Delineation of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Believers, when either by the greatness
of any Sin, or by a long continuance in an evil
and a careless frame, they are cast under a sense
of Divine displeasure. This opens their Minds
and their Hearts, declaring how all things are
within, which they cannot deny. It is not so
with many in the same Measures and Degrees
as it was with <hi>David,</hi> whose falls were very
great, but the substance of it is found in them all.
And herein the Heart knoweth it's own Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
a Stranger intermedleth not with it: None
knows the groaning and labouring of a Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of such Spiritual Decays, but he alone in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58587:127"/>
whom they are. Hereon is it cast down to the
Earth, going mourning all the day long, though
others know nothing of it's Sorrows: But it is
of a far more sad Consideration, to see men
manifesting their inward Decays by their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Fruits, and yet are little or not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
therein. The former are in ways of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
these in the Paths that go down to the
Chambers of Death.</p>
               <p>I suppose, therefore, I may take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that there are few Professors of Religion,
who have had any long continuance in the ways
of it, having withal been exposed unto the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of Life, and much exercised with the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of it; but that they have been asleep in
their days, as the Spouse complains of her self,
<hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 2. that is, they have been overtaken with
decays of one sort or another, either with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto Spiritual or Moral Duties, in their
Relation unto Churches or Families; in their
Judgments, or their Affections; in their inward
Frames or outward Actions, they have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
with the effects of Sloth, Negligence, or
the want of a continual Watch in the Life of
Faith: I with it were otherwise.</p>
               <p>I principally herein intend those gradual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clensions
in the Life and Power of Grace, which
Men in a long course of Profession are subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
And these for the most part proceed from
Formality in Holy Duties, under the constant
outward performance of them; vehement En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
in the Affairs of Life, an overvaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58587:128"/>
of sinful Enjoyments, growth in Carnal Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
neglect of daily Mortification of such Sins
as Men are naturally disposed unto, with a secret
influence from the prevalent Temptation of the
days wherein we live, which things are not now
to be spoken unto.</p>
               <p>3. BUT I come to that which was proposed
in the Third Place, namely, To shew that this
at present is the State of many Professors of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that they are fallen under those Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Decays, and do not enjoy the effects of the
Promises concerning Flourishing and Fruitfulness,
which we have insisted on. To fasten a Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
on them, or some of them at least, that
it is indeed so with them, is my present Design:
and this ought to be done with some diligence.
The Glory of Christ, the Honour of the Gospel,
and the danger of the Souls of Men do call for
it. This is the secret root of all our Evil, which
will not be removed unless it be digged up; who
sees not, who complains not of the loss of, or
Decays in the Power of Religion, in the days
wherein we live? But few there are, who either
know or apply themselves, or direct others unto
the proper Remedy of this Evil. Besides, it is
almost as difficult to convince Men of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Decays, as it is to recover them from them;
but without this, healing is impossible. If Men
know not their Sickness, they will not seek for
a Cure. Some when they see their Sickness, and
their Wound, will apply themselves unto wrong
useless Remedies, like them in the Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi>
5. 13. But none will make use of any Cure who
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58587:128"/>
see no Disease at all. Wherefore, to fasten a
Conviction hereof on the Minds of some, we may
make use of the ensuing Enquiries and Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>1.
HAVE you in the way of your Profession
had any Experience of these Spiritual Decays? I
doubt not but that there are some who have been
preserved green and flourishing, from their first
Conversion unto God, who never fell under the
power of Sloth, Neglect, or Temptation, at least
not for any remarkable Season; but they are but
few. It was not so scarce with any of those Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
under the Old Testament, whose Lives
and Walkings are recorded for our Instruction;
and they must be such as lived in an exact and
diligent course of Mortification. And some there
are who have obtained Relief and Deliverance
from under their Decays, whose Backslidings have
been healed, and their Diseases cured. So it was
with <hi>David,</hi> as he Divinely expresseth it, <hi>Psal.</hi>
103. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Bless the Lord, O my Soul, and
all that is within me, bless his Holy Name: Who
forgiveth all thine Iniquities, and herewith all thy Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cases:
Who redeemeth thy Life from Destruction, and
crowneth thee with Loving kindness, and tender Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things, so
that thy Youth is renewed like the Eagles.</hi> So doth
he celebrate his Deliverance from that State,
whereof he complains, <hi>Psalm</hi> 38. which we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
before. And there is no Grace or Mercy
that doth more affect the Hearts of Believers,
that gives them a greater Transport of Joy and
Thankfulness, than this of Deliverance from
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58587:129"/>
Backslidings. It is a bringing of the Soul out of
Prison, which enlargeth it unto Praise, <hi>Psal.</hi> 142.
7. Of this sort I doubt not but that there are
many; for God hath given great warnings of the
danger of a Spiritually decaying State; and he
hath made great Promises of Recovery from it,
and multitudes in the Church are daily exercised
herein: but I speak in general unto all. Have
you any Experience of such Spiritual Decays, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the frame of your Spirits, or in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of your walking before God, or at least that
you are prone unto them, if not mightily preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Power of Grace in your own utmost
Diligence? If you have not so, then I fear it is
from one of these two Causes.</p>
               <p>1. THAT indeed you have never had any
flourishing Spiritual State in your Souls. He
that hath been always weak and sickly, doth not
know what it is to want a state of Health and
Strength, because he never had experience of it;
much less doth he that is dead, know what it is
to want Life. But he that from an exquisite
Temper of Health, falls into languishing Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
knows distinctly, both how it was, and how
it is with him. And the frame of the Minds of
many Professors of Religion, with the manner of
their walking, is such, as that if they are not sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Spiritual Decays, it is evident that they never
had any good Spiritual Health; and it is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to treat with such Persons about a Recovery.
There are amongst those who make an outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of true Religion, many that live in all sorts
of Sins. If you should deal with them about Back-slidings,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58587:129"/>
Decays, and a Recovery, you will seem
unto them as <hi>Lot</hi> did to his Sons-in-law, when
he told them of the Destruction of <hi>Sodom,</hi> as one
that mocked, or made sport with them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.
14. or you will be mocked by them for your
pains; they have been always such as they are,
it was never otherwise with them, and it is a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
thing to speak to them of a Recovery.
We must be able in this case to say to Men, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
whence you are fallen, and repent, and do
your first works,</hi> Revel. 2. 5. They must have had
an experience of a better State, or they will not
endeavour a Recovery from that wherein they
are. Such therefore as see neither Evil nor Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in their present Condition, but suppose all
is well enough with them, because it is as good as
ever it was, will not easily be brought under this
Conviction; but they have that which is of no
less importance for them to enquire into, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whether they have had any thing of the Truth
of Grace or no. Or,</p>
               <p>2. IF you have not this Experience, it is to
be feared that you are asleep in Security, which
is hardly distinguishable from Death in Sin. The
Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> was sensibly decayed, and
gone off from it's Primitive Faith and Obedience,
yet she was so secure in her Condition, knew so
little of it, that she judged her self on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to be in a thriving flourishing State. She
thought her self encreased in all Church Riches
and Goods, that is, Gifts and Grace, while she
was <hi>wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind,
and naked,</hi> Revel. 3. 17. in such a State as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58587:130"/>
it is questionable, whether she had any thing
of the Life and Power of Grace to be found
in her or no. And so is it with many Churches
at this day, especially that which boasts it self
to be without Error, or Blame: And it is strange
that a Church should suppose that it flourisheth in
Grace and Gifts, when it hath nothing but a noise
of words in their stead.</p>
               <p>SO God testified concerning <hi>Ephraim,</hi> that <hi>gray
hairs were sprinkled on him, yet he knew it not,</hi> Hos.
7. 9. He was in a declining, dying condition, but
did not understand it. Hence it is added, <hi>They
do not return to the Lord their God, nor seck him
for all this,</hi> ver. 10. If Men will not learn, and
own their Spiritual Decays, there is no hopes of
prevailing with them to return unto the Lord;
<hi>the whole have no need of a Physician, but the sick;</hi>
Christ <hi>came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to
Repentance:</hi> such Persons are under the Power of
a stupid Security, from whence it will be very
hard to rouze them up. Hence it is that we have
so little success for the most part, in calling Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to look after a Revival and Recovery of their
Decays; they acknowledge no such thing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
such Calls may belong unto others; yea,
if nay word seem to come near them unto their
Disquietment, they are apt to think it was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of spight and ill will towards them; they
approve of themselves in their present Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Hence is the Complaint of Christ in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
of the Word: <hi>I have called, and ye have
refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no Man
regarded. We have set at nought all my Counsel, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58587:130"/>
you would none of my Reproof,</hi> Prov. 1. 24, 25. Hence
let this Truth be pressed a thousand times, it is
not one of a thousand who will think himself so
concerned, as to apply himself unto a Relief.
A Spirit of slumber seems to be poured on many.</p>
               <p>2. TO improve this Conviction, I would ask
of some, whether they have been able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Spiritual Peace and Joy in their Souls. I
take it for granted, that ordinarily they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable
Adjuncts of the Life of Faith, in an
humble fruitful Walk before God. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
testifieth that they are so, and no Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
lyes against it in ordinary Cases. And I
suppose that those unto whom I speak, do in some
measure know what they are, and do not delude
themselves with Fancies and Imaginations; they
have substance in them however by some deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and to some unknown. Have this Peace
and Joy been maintained and born sway in your
Minds? Have they under all Tryals and Surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zals
been quickly composed by them? Or are you
not rather on all Occasions uneasie and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
This is certain, that a decaying Spiritual
State, and solid Spiritual Peace, are inconsistent:
And if ever you had such Peace, you may by
the loss of it, know into what state you are
come.</p>
               <p>3. NOT to enquire further into things inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and hidden, wherein Men may justifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
if they please, there are too many open
visible Evidences of these Decays among Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of Religion; they have not kept them from
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58587:131"/>
he Eyes of the Church, nor yet from the World.
Do not Pride, Selfishness, Worldliness, Levity
of Attire, and Vanity of Life, with corrupt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savoury
Communication, abound among many?
The World was never in a worse posture for
Conformity, than it is at this day, wherein all
Flesh hath corrupted it's ways; and yet as unto
things of outward appearance, how little dinstin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is left between it, and those who would
be steemed more strict Professors of Religion!
was this the way and manner of the Saints of old,
of those that went before us in the same Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?
Was it so with our selves in the time of
our first Espousals, when we went after God in
the Wilderness, in a Land that was not sown;
as <hi>Jerem.</hi> 2. 2? Some understand what I say: If
we have not some of us had better days, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had good days in our Lives; if we have had
them, why do we not stir up our selves to look
after a Recovery?</p>
               <p>4. MAY not God say of many of us, what he
said of his People of old; <hi>Thou hast been weary of
me, O Israel?</hi> Isa. 43. 22. Have we not been wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God, untill we have abundant cause to be
weary of our selves? The most, I presume will
be ready with them in <hi>Malachi,</hi> to say, <hi>How, or
wherein have we been weary of God?</hi> Do we not
abide, yea, abound in the Duties of his Service?
What can be more required of us? wherein are
we to blame? This were something indeed, but
that it is often so, that Men are weary of Cod,
when they even weary God with their Duties
and Services, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 13, 14. God says in his Word,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58587:131"/>
He is weary, They say in their Hearts they are
weary, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13. But I answer,</p>
               <p>MANY cannot with any modesty make use of
this pretence. Their Sloth, Indifferency, and
Negligence in the Observance of the Duties of
Divine Worship, both in private and publick, is
notorious. In particular, is not the Duty of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
Prayer neglected by many, at least as to it's
constancy and fervency? And although it be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Light of Nature, confirmed by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Rules of the Scripture, requisite unto the
Dedication of a Family unto God, strengthened
by the constant Example of all the Saints of old,
and necessary in the Experience of all that walk
with God; yet do not many begin to seek out
pleas and arguings to justifie their Omission here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?
Are not all things filled with the fruits of
the negligence of such Professors in the Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Children and Servants? And hath not
God given severe Rebukes unto many of us in
their fearful miscarriages? And as unto the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worship of God, I wish that Sloth and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency
did not appear upon too many, under
various pretences. But,</p>
               <p>2. THIS is not that which I do intend. Men
may be weary of God, whilst they abide in the
observance of a multitude of outward Duties.</p>
               <p>1. THEY may be so, with respect unto that
Spirituality and Intention of mind unto the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of all Grace, which are required unto such
Duties. These are the Life, the Soul, the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58587:132"/>
Principle of them, without which their
outward performance is but a dead Carkass. Men
may draw nigh to God with their Lips, when
their Hearts are far from him. This is that
which becomes God in his Worship, and is use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to our own Souls; for <hi>God is a Spirit, and he
will be worshipped in Spirit and in Truth;</hi> which he
is not, but in the Exercise of the Graces of his
Spirit in the Worshippers; <hi>For bodily exercise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth
little, but Godliness is profitable unto all things,</hi>
1 Tim. 4. 8.</p>
               <p>TO keep up the Mind unto this frame, to stir
up all Grace unto a constant vigorous Exercise
in all Holy Duties, is a matter whereunto great
Spiritual Diligence and Watchfulness is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
Watch unto Prayer. A thousand pretences
rise against it; all the Arts of Sloth, Formality,
weariness of the Flesh, and the business of Life,
do contend to frustrate the design of it. And
the suitableness of resting in the work done unto
the Principles of a Natural Conscience, gives ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
to them all: And when Men come to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
themselves herein, it may be it were better that
for a time such Duties were wholly omitted; for in
that case Conscience it self will urgently call on
Men not hardened in Sin, to a consideration of
their Condition: wherefore much Spiritual La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and Diligence is required in this matter.
The outward performance of Religious Duties,
be they never so many, or however strictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
as the daily and nightly Canonical hours
amongst the Popish Devotionists, is an easie task,
much inferiour unto the constant labour which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:58587:132"/>
some Men use in their Trades and Callings. And
in them, in the performance of them either publick,
or in their Families, men may be weary of God:
And according as they are remiss in the constant
keeping up of Spirituality, and the Exercise of
Grace in sacred Duties, so is the Degree of their
Weariness. And there is almost nothing whereby
Men may take a safer Measure of their Decays,
or Growth, than by the usual frame of their
Minds in these Duties. If they do constantly in
them <hi>stir up themselves to take hold of God,</hi> as Isa.
64. 7. it is an evidence of a good Temper of
Spiritual Health in the Soul. But this will not
be done without the utmost Watchfulness and
Care against Impressions from the Flesh and other
Temptations. But Sloth and Formality, herein,
is a sign of a thriftless State in the inner man:
And all Inventions of such Formality are disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
unto the Interest Grace.</p>
               <p>2. SO is it with them also who attending un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the outward Duties of Religion, do yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
themselves in any known Sin; for there
is nothing of God in those Duties, which tend
not unto the mortification of all Sin: and Men may
keep up a Form of Godliness, to countenance
themselves in the neglect of it's Power. And in
particular, where any known Sin is indulged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
where the mortification of it is not duly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured,
where our Religious Duties are not
used, applied and directed unto that end, there
is a weariness of whatever is of God in them,
nor hath the Soul any real entercourse or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:58587:133"/>
5. IF we should make a particular Enquiry
into the State of our Souls, with respect unto
those Graces which are most useful, and tend
most to the Glory of God, it is to be feared,
that the Decays of many would be made very
evident; such are Zeal, Humility, Contriteness
of Heart, Spiritual mindedness, vigour of Soul,
and Delight in the ways of God, Love, Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Self-denial, and like. Are we fat and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
in these things even in old Age? Are they
in us, and do abound, as the Apostle speaks?
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. Do we bring forth the fruit of them
so as to show the Faithfulness of God in his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of Grace? I shall not make a particular En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into them, but only give two General
Rules whereby we may try our selves with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto them all.</p>
               <p>1. THE loss of a Spiritual Appetite unto the
Food of our Souls, is an Evidence of a Decay in
all these Graces. Spiritual Appetite consists in
Earnest Desires, and a Savoury Relish: So it is
described by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 2, 3. As new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
Babes desire the sincere Milk of the Word, that
ye may grow thereby; if so be you have tasted that
the Lord is gracious.</hi> There is required unto this
Spiritual Appetite an earnest desire of the Word,
grounded on an Experience of the Grace of God
in it unto this end, that we may grow and thrive
Spiritually thereby. And this Appetite will give
us as just a measure of the State of Grace in us,
as a Natural Appetite unto wholsome Food,
with due digestion thereon, doth give of a good
state of Health in the Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:58587:133"/>
THIS therefore we are to enquire into:
Doth it abide in us as formerly? We hear the
Word preached as much as ever; but do we do
it with the same desire and Spiritual Relish as
before? Some hear to satisfie their Convictions,
some to please their Fancies, and some to judge
of the Persons by whom it is dispensed. It is
but in few that the necessary preparation for the
due receiving of it are found.</p>
               <p>WHEN Men grow in Age, they lose much of
their Natural Appetite unto Food; they must
eat still for the maintenance of Life, but they do
it not with that desire after it, and that gust in
it as in the days of Youth and Health. Hence
they are apt to think, that the meat which they
had formerly was more savoury than what is now
provided for them; though what they now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
is much to be preferred before what they
then had: the change is in themselves. So we
may find not a few Professors, who are ready to
think and say, that the preaching which they
had in former days, and the Religious Exercises
which they were ingaged in, were far to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
above what they now enjoy. But the
Change is in themselves, they have lost their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Appetite, or their hunger and thirst after
the Food of their Souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THE full Soul loatheth the Honey-comb; but to
the hungry Soul every bitter thing is sweet,</hi> Prov.
27. 7. Men being grown full of themselves, and
of a good conceit of their own Abilities, have
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58587:134"/>
lost their Spiritual Appetite unto the Word of
God; and this makes the Word lose it's Power
and Efficacy towards them. That Word which
the Psalmist says is <hi>sweeter than the honey, or
honey-comb,</hi> Psal. 19. 10. hath little or no taste or
relish in it unto them. If they were hungry,
they would find a sweetness in the bitterest of
it's Reproofs, beyond what they can now find
in the sweetest of it's Promises. They come to
hear the Word with sick Desires, and low Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations,
as if they were invited to eat after a
Feast, being self-full before. But this loss of a
Spiritual Appetite, is an Evidence of the Decay
of all other Graces whatever.</p>
               <p>2. A neglect of making Religion our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
business, is another Evidence of the Decay of
all sorts of Grace in us: For where Grace is in
it's proper Exercise, it will subordinate all things
unto Religion, and the Ends of it, as <hi>David</hi> twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
times declares in the <hi>119th.</hi> Psalm. All things,
all Occasions of Life shall be postponed thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
The Love and valuation of it will bear sway
in our Minds, our Thoughts and Affections, and
the practice of it shall give Rule unto all other
Concernments: But is it so with many amongst
us? It is well if Religion be <hi>one thing,</hi> it is far
enough from being <hi>the</hi> One thing; every other
thing is preferred before it, and it can hardly
crowd in to possess any place in their Minds.
To see Men continually plodding in the Affairs of
the World, regulating all their actings by their
concernment in them, diverting only at some sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
as it were out of their way unto Duties of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58587:134"/>
Religion, it is vain to say, that they make
Religion their Business: But there is scarce a
more certain Evidence of a frame of Mind spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
Decaying in all sorts of Graces, if ever
any of them were in it in Sincerity and Power,
than this one, that Men do not make Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their chiefest Business: And a little Self-Examination
will help Men to judge what it is
that they make so to be.</p>
               <p>LASTLY, I might also instance in the
uselesness of Men in their Profession; in want
of Love unto all Saints, Barrenness in Good
Works, unreadiness and unwillingness to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
in any extraordinary manner with the Calls
of God unto Repentance and Reformation; in
Love of the World, and Pride of Life, with
Passions suited unto such Principles, predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in them; for they are all undeniable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
that those with whom they are found,
had never any true Grace at all, or that they
are fallen under woful Decays. But what hath
been spoken may be sufficient unto our present
purpose.</p>
               <p>THIS is the third thing that was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
namely, an endeavour to leave Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on the Minds of some concerning their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Decays, and the necessity of seeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a Revival by the Means that shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on. And I intend it principally for those
of us who under a long Profession, are now come
unto Age, aud shall not have much time for Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58587:135"/>
continued unto us. And the Truth is, I
meet with none, who are Christians of any
considerable Experience, and are Spiritually
minded, but they are sensible of the Danger of
such Decays in this hour of Temptation, and
how difficult it is in the use of all means to
keep up a vigorous active frame of Mind in
Faith, Love, Holiness and Fruitfulness. And
for those who are not concerned herein, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
I know not what to make of them, or
their Religion.</p>
               <p>4. I proceed unto that which was proposed
in the fourth, or last place; namely, the Way
and Means whereby Believers may be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from these Decays, and come to thrive and
flourish in the inward Principle, and outward
Fruits of Spiritual Life, which will bring us
back unto the Consideration of that Truth
which we may seem to have diverted from.
And to this end, the things ensuing are propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
unto Consideration.</p>
               <p>1. THE State of Spiritual Decays is reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable.
No Man that is fallen under it hath
any Reason to say There is no hope, provided
he take the right way for his Recovery. If
every step that is lost in the way to Heaven
should be irrecoverable, Woe would be unto
us; we should all assuredly perish. If there
were no Reparation of our Breaches, no heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our Decays, no Salvation but for them
who are always progressive in Grace; if God
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58587:135"/>
                  <hi>should mark all that is done amiss,</hi> as the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
speaks, <hi>O Lord, who should stand?</hi> Nay, if
we had not Recoveries every day, we should
go off with a perpetual Backsliding. But then,
as was said, it it required that the right
means of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it be used, and not that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
of what is designed, whereof I shall
give an Instance. When Trees grow old, or
are decaying, it is useful to dig about them,
and manure them, which may cause them to
flourish again, and abound in Fruit: But instead
hereof, if you remove them out of their Soil,
to plant them in another, which may promise
much advantage, they will assuredly wither
and dye. So it is with Professors, and hath
been with many; finding themselves under ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
Decays, and little or nothing of the Life
and Power of Religion left in them, they have
grown weary of their Station, and have chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
their Soyl, or turning from one way in
Religion unto another, as some have turned
Papists, some Quakers, and the like, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
that fault to be in the Religion which
they professed, which was indeed only in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
You cannot give an instance of any one
who did not visibly wither and dye therein;
but had they used the proper means for their
Healing and Recovery, they might have lived
and brought forth Fruit.</p>
               <p>2. A strict Attendance unto the Severities of
Mortification, with all the Duties that lead
thereunto, is required unto this end: So also is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58587:136"/>
the utmost Diligence in all Duties of Obedience.
These things naturally offer themselves, as the
first Relief in this case, and they ought not to
be omitted. But if I should insist upon them,
they would branch themselves into such a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of particular Directions, as it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with my Design here to handle. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the way which I intend to propose is of
another Nature, though consistent with all
the Duties included in this Proposal; yea, such
as without which not one of them can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in a due manner. Wherefore, as unto
these things, I shall only assert their Necessity,
with a double Limitation.</p>
               <p>1. THAT no Duties of Mortification be
prescribed unto this end, as a Means of Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
from Spiritual Decays, but what for Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Manner are of Divine Institution and
Command. All others are laid under a severe
Interdict, under what pretence soever they may
be used, <hi>Who hath required these things at your
hands?</hi> Want hereof, is that whereby a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Design to advance Religion in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
hath ruined it. They have under the
name and pretence of the means of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or the Duties of it, invented and enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
like the Pharisees, a number of Works,
Ways, Duties, so called, which God never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
nor approved, nor will accept, nor
shall they ever do good unto the Souls of Men.
Such are their Confessions, Disciplines, Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
Fastings, Abstinence, framed Prayers to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58587:136"/>
be repeated in stated Canonical hours, in such
a length and number. In the bodily Labour
of these things, they exercise themselves to no
Spiritual Advantage.</p>
               <p>BUT it is Natural to all Men to divert to
such Reliefs in this case. Those who are
throughly convinced of Spiritual Decays, are
therewithall pressed with a sense of the Guilt
of Sin; for it is Sin which hath brought them
into that Condition. Hereon in the first place
they set their Contrivance at work, how they
may atone Divine Displeasure, and obtain Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
with God: And if they are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the actual Conduct of Evangelical Light,
two things immediately offer themselves unto
them. First, Some extraordinary course in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which God hath not commanded. This
is the way which they betake themselves unto
in the Papacy, and which Guilt in the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of corrupted Nature vehemently calls for.
Secondly, An extraordinary multiplication of
such Duties, as for the substance of them are
required of us. An instance in both kinds we
have <hi>Micah 6. 6, 7. Wherewith shall I come before
the Lord, and bow my self before the high God?
Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with
Calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased
with thousands of Rams, or with ten thousands of
Rivers of Oyl? Shall I give my First-born for my
Transgressions, the Fruit of my Body for the Sin of
my Soul?</hi> And by this means they hope for a
Restitution into their former Condition. And
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58587:137"/>
whereas Spiritual Decays are of two sorts:
First, from the Power and Effect of Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
only, which are multiplied among Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
Believers: And Secondly, from Degrees
in the Power and Effects of Saving Grace.
Those whose Decays are of the first sort, are
never to be diverted from, attempting their
Relief by such means: And when they find them
fail, for the most part they cease contending,
and abandon themselves to the power of their
Lusts; for they have no Evangelical Light to
guide them in another course.</p>
               <p>UNTO them who are of the second Sort,
is this Direction given, in an endeavour for a
Recovery from Backsliding, and thriving in
Grace, by a redoubled Attendance unto the
Duties of Mortification, and New Obedience.
Let care be taken, that as unto the matter of
them they be of Divine Appointment, and as
to the manner of their performance, that it be
regulated by the Rules of the Scripture. Such
are constant Reading and Hearing of the Word,
Prayer with fervency therein, a diligent watch
against all Temptations and occasions of Sin;
especially an Endeavour by an Holy Earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and vehement Rebukes, of the entrance of
any other Frame, to keep the Mind Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and Heavenly in it's Thoughts and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>2. LET them take heed, that they attempt
not these things in their own strength. When
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58587:137"/>
Men have strong Convictions, that such and
such things are their own Duty, they are apt to
act as if they were to be done in their own
strength. They must do them, they will do
them, that is as unto the outward work, and
therefore they think they can do them, that is
in a due manner. The Holy Ghost hath for
ever rejected this confidence, none shall prosper
in it, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 5.</hi> Chap. 9. 8. But hereby many
deceive themselves, labouring in the Fire, while
all they do doth immediately perish; they have
been negligent and careless, whereby things
are come to an ill posture with them, and that
peace which they had is impaired: But now
they will pray, and read, and fast, and be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
to the poor, and now an Abstinence from
Sin. All these things they suppose they can do
of themselves, because they can and ought to
perform the outward works, wherein the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
intended do consist. Hereby Christ is left
out of the whole Design, who when all is done,
is the Lord that healeth us, <hi>Exod. 1 5. 26.</hi> And
there is another evil herein; for whatever Men
do in their own Natural Abilities, there is a
secret Reserve of some kind of Merit in it.
Those who plead for these things, do averr
there can be no merit in any thing, but what
proceeds from our own Free-will; and what is
so done, hath some kind of merit inseparably
accompanying of it; And this is enough to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all Endeavours of this kind not only use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
and fruitless, but utterly rejected. Faith
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Assistance of Christ and his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58587:138"/>
in and unto these Duties; or however they
may be multiplied, they will not he effectual
unto our Healing and Recovery. These things
are to be used, according as we receive sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
of Grace from above, in Subordination
unto that Work of Faith that shall be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Wherefore,</p>
               <p>3. THE Work of recovering Backsliders or
Believers from under their Spiritual Decays,
is an Act of Soveraign Grace, wrought in us by
vertue of Divine Promises; out of this Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
cometh meat. Because Belivers are liable
to such Declensions, Backslidings, and Decays,
God hath provided and given unto us great and
precions Promises of a Recovery, if we duly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
our selves unto the Means of it. One of
the places only wherein they are recorded, I
shall here call over, and explain, <hi>Hosea 14. 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. O Israel, return unto the Lord
they God, for thou hast fallen by thine Iniquit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>:
Take with you words, and turn with the Lord, say
unto him, Take away all Iniquity, and receive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously:
so will we render the calves of our lips,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>I will heal their Backslidings, I will love them
freely, for mine Anger is turned away from him:
I will be as the dew unto Israel; be shall grow as
the Lilly, and cast out his Roots as Lebanon. His
Branches shall spread, and his Beauty shall be as the
Olive Tree, and his smell as Lebanon. They that
dwell under his shadow shall return, they shall revive
as the Corn, and grow as the Vine, the scent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
shall be as the Wine of Lebanon: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Wall
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58587:138"/>
say, What have I to do any more with Idols? I
have heard him, and observed him, I am like a
green Fir-tree; from me is thy fruit found.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE whole matter treated of in general,
both as unto the Disease and Remedy, is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stated in this passage of Scripture; and that
in the Experience of the Church, and God's
dealing with them: we may therefore receive
many plain Directions from it, and a safe
Guidance in our Progress, which we shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to take in the ensuing Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>1. THIS Application of God unto <hi>Israel,
(O Israel return,</hi>) was made when the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of the People were wicked and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto utter Destruction. So it is declared
in the last words of the foregoing Chapter,
and their Desolation fell out not long after ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.
Wherefore, no Season nor Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of things shall obstruct Soveraign
Grace, when God will exercise it towards his
Church: It shall work in the midst of desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Judgments.</p>
               <p>2. IN such a time the true <hi>Israel</hi> of God,
the Elect themselves, are apt to be overtaken
with the Sins of the whole, and so to Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slide
from God, and so to fall into Spiritual
Decays. So <hi>Israel</hi> had now done, though she
had not absolutely broken Covenant with God;
He was yet unto her <hi>The Lord thy God,</hi> yet she
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58587:139"/>
had fallen by her Iniquity. Times of publick
Apostacy are often accompanied with partial
defects in the best; <hi>Because Iniquity aboundeth,
the love of many shall wax cold,</hi> Mat. 24. 12.</p>
               <p>3. WHEN God designs to heal the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding
of his People by Soveraign Grace, he
gives them effectual Calls unto Repentance, and
the use of means for their Healing: So he doth
here by his Prophet, <hi>O Israel return, take with
you words.</hi> And if I could see that God did stir
up his Faithful Ministers to apply themselves
in a peculiar manner, unto this Work of pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
vehemently all their Congregations with
their Duty herein; and let them know, that
there is no other way to prevent their Ruine,
but by returning unto the Lord, according to
the ways of it here prescribed; I should not
doubt but that the time of Healing were at
hand.</p>
               <p>4. THE means prescribed unto this end,
that our Backslidings may be healed, in a way
suited unto the Glory of God, is renewed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:
And this acts it self,</p>
               <p>1. IN servent Prayer; <hi>Take with you words,
and say.</hi> Consider the Greatness and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the Work before you, and weigh well
what you do in your dealing with God. The
matter of this Prayer is twofold: (1.) The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of all Iniquity; that is, the taking of it
away: And no Sin is omitted, all being now
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58587:139"/>
become equally burthensome; <hi>take away all Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
When the Souls of Sinners are in good
earnest in their Return unto God, they will
leave out the Consideration of no one Sin what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
Nor are we meet for Healing, nor shall
we apply our selves unto it in a due manner,
without some previous sense of the Love of
God in the pardon of our Sin. (2.) Gracious
Acceptation, <hi>Receive us graciously.</hi> The words
in the Original are only, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <hi>receive
good:</hi> but both the words being used vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
the Sense eminently included in them, is
well expressed by <hi>receive us graciously.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we have cast our selves under tokens of thy
Displeasure, now let us know that we are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accepted with thee. And this also lyes in
the Desires of them who design to obtain an
Healing of their Backslidings; for under them
they are sensible that they are obnoxious unto
Gods Displeasure.</p>
               <p>2. AFFECTIONATE Confessions of the
Sin, wherein their Beckslidings did consist, or
which were the Occasions of them. <hi>Ashur shall
not save us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>we will say no more to the work
of our hands, Ye are our Gods.</hi> Fleshly Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and False Worship, were the two great
Sins that had now ruined the Body of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
These Believers themselves had an Acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
unto them more or less, as now they have
unto the prevailing Sins of the Days wherein
we live, by Conformity unto the World. Of
these Sins God expecteth a full and free Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in order unto our Healing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:58587:140"/>
3. A renewed Covenant Engagement to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all other Hopes and Expectation, and
to betake themselves with their whole Trust
and Confidence unto him; whereof they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
First, The Cause, which was his meer
Grace and Mercy: <hi>For in thee the Fatherless find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Mercy;</hi> And Secondly, The Effect of it,
which is Praise and Thanksgiving: <hi>So will we
render the Calves of our Lips.</hi> And some things
we may hence farther observe as unto the Case
under Consideration. As,</p>
               <p>1. ALTHOUGH God will repair our
Spiritual Decays, and heal our Backslidings free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet he will do it so, or in such a way, as
wherein he may communicate Grace unto us,
to the praise of his own Glory. Therefore
are these Duties prescribed unto us in order
thereunto; for although they are not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
Cause of the Love and Grace from
whence alone we are healed, yet are they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in the method of the Dispensation of
Grace, to precede the Effect of them. Nor
have we any where a more illustrious Instance
and Testimony of the Consistency and Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
which is between Soveraign Grace, and the
diligent discharge of our Duty, than we have
in this place: For as God promiseth, that he
would heal their Backslidings out of his free
Love, <hi>verse</hi> 4. and would do it by the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
of Effectual Grace; <hi>ver.</hi> 5. so he injoyns
them all these Duties in order thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:58587:140"/>
2. THAT Tunless we find these things wrought
in us in a way of preparation, for the receiving of
the Mercy desired, we have no firm ground of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
that we shall be made partakers of it:
For this is the method of Gods dealing with the
Church. Then, and then only we may expect a
gracious Reviving from all our Decays, when se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Repentance working in the ways declared,
is found in us. This Grace will not surprize us
in our Sloth, Negligence, and Security, but
will make way for it self, by stirring us up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
sincere endeavours after it, in the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
of these Duties. And untill we see
better Evidences of this Repentance among us,
than as yet appears, we can have but small
Hopes of a general Recovery from our present
Decays.</p>
               <p>5. THE Work it self is declared, (1.) By
it's Nature. (2.) In it's Causes. (3.) From it's
Effects.</p>
               <p>1. IN the Nature of it, it is the healing of
Backslidings; <hi>I will heal their Backslidings;</hi> the
Sin whereby they are fallen off from God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom they are now exhorted to Return.
These bring the Souls of Men into a diseased
Estate, and danger of Death: The Cure here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is the Work of God alone. Hence he gives
himself that Title, <hi>I am the Lord that healeth
thee,</hi> Exod. 15. 26. And because of the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous
Nature of Sin, and the danger it brings
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58587:141"/>
of Eternal Death unto the Souls of Men, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
of it, or a Recovery from it, is often
called by the name of <hi>Healing, Psal. 6. 2. Isai.
57. 18, 19. Hos.</hi> 6. 1. Here it includeth two
things; First, the pardon of Sin past, and then
a supply of Grace to make us fruitful in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
<hi>I will be as the Dew to Israel,</hi> as we
shall see. This is God's Healing of Backsli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
               <p>2. IN the Causes of it, which are, (1.) The
Principal moving Cause, and that is free unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
Love; <hi>I will love them freely.</hi> From hence
alone is our Recovery to be expected. (2.) The
Efficient Cause, which as unto Sins past is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
Mercy; <hi>Mins Anger is turned away from
him:</hi> And as unto renewed Obedience, in which
two our Recovery consists, it is in a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Supply of Effectual Grace; <hi>I will be as the
Dew unto Israel.</hi> Fresh supplies of the Spirit
of Grace from above are so expressed:
This is necessary unto our Healing and Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
               <p>3. IT is described by it's Effect, which is a
much more abundant Fruitfulness in Holiness
and Obedience, in Peace and Love, than ever
they had before attained. This the Prophet
sets out in multiplied Similitudes and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors,
to denote the Greatness and Efficacy of
the Grace so communicated.</p>
               <p>I have a little insisted on the opening of this
Context, for sundry Reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:58587:141"/>
1. THE Case which I would consider, is in
all the parts of it stated distinctly, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
clearly unto us. There is nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
but only the especial Way, whereby in
the Exercise of Faith this Grace may be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which is that which I shall speak unto in
the last place, as that which is principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in this Discourse.</p>
               <p>2. THAT I might shew how great a thing
it is to have our Spiritual Decays made up,
our Backslidings healed, and so to attain the
vigorous acting of Grace and Spiritual Life,
with a flourishing Profession, and fruitful Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
in Old Age: It is so set forth here by
the Holy Ghost, as that every one must needs have
a sense of the Beauty and Glory of the Work:
It is that which Divine Love, Mercy and Grace
are eminently effectual in unto the Glory of
God, that which so many Duties are required
to prepare us for. Let no Man think that it is a
light or common work, every thing in it is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar:
It is unto them who are made partakers
of it, a Life from the Dead.</p>
               <p>3. THAT none may utterly despond under
their Decays. When Persons are awakened by
new Convictions, and begin to feel the weight
of them, and how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> they are intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with them, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ready to faint, and
even to despair of Deliverance. But we see
that here is a Promise of Deliverance from them
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58587:142"/>
by pardoning Mercy, and also of such fresh
Springs of Grace as shall cause us to abound in
Holiness and Fruitfulness. Who is it that is
entangled with Corruptions and Temptations,
that groans under a sense of a cold lifeless bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
frame of Heart? he may take in Spiritual
Refreshment, if by Faith he can make Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Promise unto himself.</p>
               <p>4. THAT which remains, is to declare the
particular Way whereby in the Exercise of
Faith, we may obtain the Fruit of this and
all other Promises of the like Nature, unto
the End so often proposed; namely, of being
flourishing and fruitful even in Old Age. Now
supposing a due Attendance unto the Duties
mentioned, I shall give some Directions, with
respect unto that which gives Life, Power and
Efficacy unto them all, and which will infallibly
bring us unto the full Enjoyment of this Signal
Mercy: And they are these that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ollow.</p>
               <p>1. ALL our Supplies of Grace are from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ. Grace is declared in the Promises
of the Old Testament, but the way of it's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
and our receiving of it, is revealed
unto us in the New. This belongs to the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of it, that all Grace is from Christ, and
shall be in vain expected any other way. He
hath assured us, that <hi>without him we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi>
we can no more bring forth Fruit, than
a Branch can that is separated from the Vine,
<hi>John</hi> 15. 3, 4, 5. He is our Head, and all our
<pb facs="tcp:58587:142"/>
Spiritual Influences, that is, Divine Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Grace; are from him alone. He is
our Life efficiently, and liveth in us effective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
so as that our Ability for vital Acts is from
him, <hi>Gal. 2. 20. Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2. Are we then any
of us under Convictions of Spiritual Decays?
or do we long for such Renovations of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
strength, as may make us flourish in
Faith, Love and Holiness, we must know as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly,
that nothing of all this can be attained,
but it must come from Jesus Christ alone. We
see what Promises are made, what Duties are
prescribed unto us; but however, we should
endeavour to apply our selves unto the one on
the other, they would yield us no Relief, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we know how to receive it from Christ
himself.</p>
               <p>2. THE only way of receiving Supplies of
Spiritual Strength and Grace, from Jesus Christ,
on our part, is by Faith. Hereby we come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, are implanted in him, abide with him,
so as to bring forth Fruit. He dwells in our
Hearts by Faith, and he acts in us by Faith, and
we live by Faith in or on the Son of God.
This I suppose will be granted, that if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any thing from Christ, it must be by
Faith, it must be in the Exercise of it, or in a
way of Believing; nor is there any one word
in the Scripture that gives the least Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to expect either Grace or Mercy from him
in any other way, or by any other means.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:58587:143"/>
3. THIS Faith respects the Person of Christ,
his Grace, his whole Mediation, with all the
Effects of it, and his Glory in them all. This is
that which hath been so much insisted on in the
foregoing Discourses, as that it ought not to be
again insisted on: This therefore is the issue of
the whole. A steady view of the Glory of
Christ, in his Person, Grace, and Office, thrô
Faith, or a constant lively Exercise of Faith
on him, according as he is revealed unto us in
the Scripture, is the only effectual way to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a Revival from under our Spiritual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays,
and such Supplies of Grace as shall make
us Flourishing and Fruitful even in Old Age.
He that thus lives by Faith in him, shall by his
Spiritual thriving and growth, shew, <hi>That the
Lord is upright, that he is our Rock, and that there
is no unrighteousness in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE may consider briefly: First, How this
is is testified unto in the Scripture, and then
what are the ways whereby this Grace, or Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
will produce this effect, and so put a close
unto this part of the Application of the Sacred
Truth before declared.</p>
               <p>1. THIS Direction is given us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 5.
<hi>They looked unto him and were lightened, and their
Faces were not ashamed.</hi> That it is Christ, or
the Glory of God in him, that is thus looked
unto, I need not prove, it will not be denied.
And it is their Faith which is expressed by their
<pb facs="tcp:58587:143"/>
looking unto him; which is nothing but that
beholding of his Glory which we have descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed:
For it is an Act of Trust arising from an
Apprehension of <hi>who</hi> and <hi>what</hi> he is. The is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
or effect hereof is, that they were lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
that is, received fresh Communication of
Spiritual, Saving, Refreshing Light from him,
and consequently of all other Graces, whence
their Faces were not ashamed; nor shall we
fail in our Expectation of new Spiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
in the Exercise of the same Faith.</p>
               <p>THIS is that which we are called unto,
<hi>Isa. 45. 22. Look unto me, and be saved, all ye
ends of the Earth.</hi> On this look to Christ, on
this view of his Glory depends our whole Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
and therefore all things that are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
thereunto, do so also: This is the way
whereby we receive Grace and Glory. This
is the Direction given us by the Holy Ghost for
the attaining of them.</p>
               <p>SO is the same Duty described, <hi>Micah 7. 7.
Therefore I will look unto the Lord, I will wait for
the God of my Salvation; my God will hear me.</hi>
The Church knew not any other way of Relief,
whatever her Distresses were.</p>
               <p>A Look unto Christ as Crucified, (and how
Glorious he was therein, hath been declared,)
is made the Cause and Fountain of that Godly
Sorrow, which is a Spring unto all other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
especially in those who have fallen under
<pb facs="tcp:58587:144"/>
Decays; <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. and it is so also of desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
strength from him, to enable us to endure
all our Tryals, Troubles and Afflictions, with
patience unto the end, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2.</p>
               <p>THE only Enquiry remaining, is, How a
constant view of the Glory of Christ, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
this Blessed Effect in us: And it will do
so several ways.</p>
               <p>1. IT will be effected by that transforming
Power and Efficacy, which this Exercise of Faith
is always accompanied withal. This is that
which changeth us every day more and more
into the likeness of Christ, as hath been at large
before declared. Herein all Revivals and all
Flourishings are contained. To have a good
measure of Conformity unto Christ, is all where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in this Life we are capable: The perfection
of it is Eternal Blessedness. According as are
our Attainments therein, so is the thriving and
flourishing of the Life of Grace in us, which is
that which is aimed at; other ways and means
it may be have failed us, let us put this to the
Tryal. Let us live in the constant Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of the Glory of Christ, and vertue will
proceed from him to repair all our Decays, to
renew a right. Spirit within us, and to cause
us to abound in all Duties of Obedience. This
way of producing these effects, Flesh and Blood
will not reveal; it looks like washing in <hi>Jordan</hi>
to cure a Leprosie: But the Life of Faith is
a Mystery known only unto them in whom
it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:58587:144"/>
2. IT will fix the Soul unto that Object
which is suited to give it Delight, Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and Satisfaction. This in perfection is Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness,
for it is caused by the Eternal Vision
of the Glory of God in Christ: And the nearer
Approaches we make unto this State, the better,
the more Spiritual, the more Heavenly is the
State of our Souls. And this is to be obtained
only by a constant Contemplation of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Christ, as hath been declared. And it is
several ways effectual unto the end now propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
For,</p>
               <p>1. THE most of our Spiritual Decays and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness
arise from an inordinate admission of
other things into our Minds; for these are they
that weaken Grace in all it's Operations. But
when the Mind is filled with thoughts of Christ
and his Glory, when the Soul thereon cleaves
unto him with intense Affections, they will cast
out, or not give admittance unto those causes
of Spiritual Weakness and Indisposition: See
<hi>Col. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Ephes.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
               <p>2. WHERE we are ingaged in this Duty,
it will stir up every Grace unto it's due Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
which is that wherein the Spiritual Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
enquired after, doth consist. This is all we
desire, all we long for, this will make us fat
and flourishing, namely, that every Grace of
the Spirit have it's due Exercise in us. See <hi>Rom.</hi>
5. 3, 4, 5. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7, 8. Whereas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb facs="tcp:58587:145"/>
Christ himself is the first proper adequate
Object of all Grace, and all it's Exercise, (for
it first respects him, and then other things for
him) when the Mind is fixed on him, and his
Glory, every Grace will be in a Readiness for
it's due Exercise. And without this we shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
attain it by any Resolutions or Endeavours
of our own, let us make the Tryal when we
please.</p>
               <p>3. THIS will assuredly put us on a vigilant
watch, and constant conflict against all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
workings of Sin, against all the Entran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Temptation, against all the ways and
means of Surprizals into foolish frames, by vain
Imaginations, which are the causes of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays.
Our Recovery or Revival will not be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
nor a fresh Spring of Grace be obtained,
in a careless, slothful Course of Profession. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
watching, fighting, contending against Sin,
with our utmost endeavour for an absolute Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
over it, are required hereunto. And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will so much excite and encourage our Souls
hereunto, as a constant view of Christ and his
Glory; every thing in him hath a constraining
Power hereunto, as is known to all who have any
Acquaintance with these things.</p>
