            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Know Addresses of this Nature are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
founded on Flattery; and when In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
guides the Pen, (without a just esteem
free from a <hi>Mercenary</hi> end) 'tis hard to avoid
it. 'Tis easier to be an <hi>Author</hi> then a <hi>Judge,</hi>
and harder to be <hi>Impartial</hi> in <hi>Commendation</hi> then
either: For where the known <hi>verity</hi> of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
proves its Title to Applause, the Nicety
is so great, that the Admirer must approach
with such a decent Respect, that the <hi>Patron</hi> may
not have more or less praise then is requisite, and
then the Writer may defie Censure.</p>
            <p>I know not which is the greatest Pleasure in
others, That of receiving Favours, or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
of 'em; But in me the latter exceeds
the first. And as your Honour was never back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in serving the poorest Petitioner, I hope
you will not be shye of receiving the thanks of
your humblest Admirer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95832:3"/>
It has been the greatest part of your Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to be in Power to serve your Friends;
nor is it possible any Advantage or Preferment
could corrupt you into the forgetfulness of 'em.
All your Favours come from you so easie, so
free from State, or Expectation of Attendance
from those you assist, that a man would almost
wish to want, only to be obliged by so much
goodness.</p>
            <p>What you now possess was accepted for
the benefit of the Publick, not the Profit of the
Employment: And the People are safest when
the Affairs of the Nation are manag'd by those
who are above <hi>Bribes,</hi> and have not their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
to make out of 'em.</p>
            <p>Much more may be said, but the World is
so very sensible of the <hi>Honour, Generosity,</hi> and
<hi>Worthiness,</hi> which attend you, That my weak
<hi>Panegirick</hi> would sound like a Tale ill and twice
told to a Person who had both heard, and could
deliver it better. I only wish I may never lose
the Happiness I now enjoy, in subscribing my
self</p>

            <head>THE
Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>IT has been a hard matter for the most Celebrated Pens to
please all humours; The best of Writers have err'd, therefore
the worst may the better be excused. All young Trees are allowed
time to bear, and a poor Soyl with diligence and care, has by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
Rewarded the pains of the Husband-man. I am not unsensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of my Imperfections, nor of the necessary Assistances I want in
writing: In the first place, I must confess I am no Schollar, which
renders me Incapable of stealing from Greek and Latin Authors,
as the better Learned have done; the dressing of an old Thought
in new Words, is an Excellency I should be ashamed of, could I do it
to Perfection. A silver Tankard may be melted down, and work'd
up into a Cup with Ears, nay, fine figures engrav'd upon it too, yet
the mettle's the same, though the fashion be alter'd.</p>
            <p>I have a natural Inclination to Poetry, which was born and not
bred in me; I endeavour to do well, but have not Learning enough
to be positive it is so; yet my Industry should not be despised, when
I confess my weakness; But the Town are as unwilling to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
a young Author, as the Play house a young Actor; well,
time may work Miracles; I am sensible if Dr. <hi>Busby</hi> had
slighted all his <hi>Junior</hi> Block-heads, scarce Divinity or Poetry
had arriv'd to that unexpected Perfection as is now extant.</p>
            <p>I know I have a great many Enemies, but why they are so,
is more than they know, I cannot remember any person I ever
injur'd willingly: If my opinion be Obnoxious to some, why,
that I must account for Above. And 'tis very hard I may not
<pb facs="tcp:95832:4"/>
enjoy it here, when my side's uppermost; and yet those who are
of a contrary mind, are allowed theirs quietly. I thought I had
been beneath their scorn, but I find their malice excuses none.</p>
            <p>I have heard a Judge (who has writ, but was advis'd not to
expose it) say there was scarce a Poet left worth hanging, but
I wish those that are, had their Deserts; my Comedy in the Play
probably is not so Light, nor the serious part of it so heavily
managed as it ought to be, yet the Masters of the Play-house
lost nothing by it, nor will the Printer I hope, though it sells
for Twelve Pence.</p>
            <p>Well, to shew you I am an encourager of Poetry, I have Printed
some verses, which but for my good nature, might have been
buried in <hi>Oblivion;</hi> but I think 'tis pitty a Style so Elegant
(attended with such Prodigious Fancy) should be lost: They
were sent me from an unknown hand by the way of Instruction.</p>
            <l>Imortal <hi>Mountfort</hi> should begin this Letter,</l>
            <l>But that thy Play's as mortal as a better,</l>
            <l>But let what will of that be said,</l>
            <l>'thas made provision for the Parsly bed;</l>
            <l>A pretty portion for thy eldest Daughter,</l>
            <l>(At which the Minor Poets mouths make Water)</l>
            <l>Who didst with little wit and much ill Nature,</l>
            <l>So soon set up for Comedy and Satyr;</l>
            <l>Prithy be free thou lucky Rogue,</l>
            <l>How came thy Jests so much invogue,</l>
            <l>That 'tis a mode to laugh and do 'em reason,</l>
            <l>Least those who dont, should be brought in for Treason.</l>
            <l>Well, Faith and Troth thou art a happy Dog,</l>
            <l>And can'st design and flatter, fawn and Cog,</l>
            <l>With a whole Audience, banter'd by an Epilogue,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:95832:4"/>
When next thou dost employ thy working Brains,</l>
            <l>Take modestly thy Fate, Husband thy Gains,</l>
            <l>And learn to speak with Reverence of <hi>James.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>That last Rhime I think is Admirable, though if he had had
Stairs to his Brains, it might have chim'd as well. I dont know
that I meddle with any State Affairs in my Play; and for <hi>Satyr,</hi>
I'll swear he has found out what I never meant.</p>
            <p>Perhaps these verses may seem a little gross, but they are
dismal severe: And I have charity to believe they were writ off
hand, for really as Mr. <hi>Bays</hi> says, I dont believe when the
Person invented 'em, he ever troubled his head about it: I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if this Gentleman cost Omnipotence a second thought, if he
did, I have heard second thoughts are best; and I cannot help
saying it cost Omnipotence its best thoughts, how to make one of
the worst Poets.</p>
            <p>Here is another facetious piece as Ironically meant, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
was seriously design'd; it was sent me as from a Woman, to
make it go down the glibber; and I think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I could not do the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
justice (any other way) but in Printing it.</p>
            <l>Hail thou the Shaksphear of our present age,</l>
            <l>Who dost at once, supply and grace the Stage</l>
            <l>With different proofs of thy surprizing wit,</l>
            <l>Vying with what the establish'd Pens have writ;</l>
            <l>Young Muse go on, whose early purchas'd Praise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>Contends with Lawriet and decaying Bays,</l>
            <l>Nor is't unjust to sacrifice both them,</l>
            <l>To thy aspiring, and as hopeful Pen,</l>
            <l>Since Emulation stil's the Poets aim,</l>
            <l>And his most lov'd Reward, but glorious fame,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:95832:5"/>
Just Praise will raise thy soreing Muse still higher,</l>
            <l>And add new Vigour, Spirit, Life, and Fire,</l>
            <l>To what thy fruitful Brain shall more acquire;</l>
            <l>But to encrease the wonder of thy pen,</l>
            <l>Thou art not now, more learn'd then <hi>Shakespear</hi> then,</l>
            <l>Who to th' amaze of the more Letter'd men,</l>
            <l>Minted such thoughts from his own Natural Brain,</l>
            <l>As the great Readers, since could ne're attain,</l>
            <l>Though daily they the stock of Learning drain,</l>
            <l>Nature most justly, in thy Play is seen,</l>
            <l>Easie the Plot, and turning of each Scene;</l>
            <l>Thy Similies so new, that they surprize</l>
            <l>Like a fresh Beautie's bright, all-conquering eyes,</l>
            <l>Thy words with artless Grace so smoothly flow,</l>
            <l>That like soft <hi>Waller's</hi> verse, thy Prose does show;</l>
            <l>Harmonious is the sound, tunes every Line,</l>
            <l>More pleasing far, then Gingling tiresome Rhime,</l>
            <l>Those few will nicely taste the sweeter Chime,</l>
            <l>Whose Soul's compos'd of numbers, like to thine.</l>
            <l>Already hast thou learnt the Art to move</l>
            <l>From nicest honour, to the tender'st Love,</l>
            <l>And gently dost instruct the blushing maid,</l>
            <l>How soon her Love, is still by Love betray'd</l>
            <l>Into a soft Confession of her flame</l>
            <l>For him that dies for what, he dares not name.</l>
            <l>This last writ Play discovers to in thee,</l>
            <l>Something like Reading, and Philosophy,</l>
            <l>Else how could'st thou, with such judicious art,</l>
            <l>Coppy true nature in each various part.</l>
            <l>The lower Comedy which seems design'd</l>
            <l>To please th'unthinking crowd, and less Refin'd,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:95832:5"/>
Even that is natural, brisk, correct, and free,</l>
            <l>Has the true Salt, and Spirit of Comedy:</l>
            <l>May it succeed, and please the carping Age,</l>
            <l>Who snarlingly enjoy'd thy Pucellage,</l>
            <l>As vext the first should so much pleasure give,</l>
            <l>Foretelling that the next would longer live.</l>
            <l>Have Courage then, and be no more afraid,</l>
            <l>You need not act again the bashful Maid:</l>
            <l>Let not the fate of that discourage thee,</l>
            <l>But listen to fam'd <hi>Waller</hi>'s Prophesie.</l>

            <l>"That ruder Draught, the Deluge wash'd away.</l>
            <l>"How many Ages past, what Blood and Toil,</l>
            <l>"Before we made one Kingdom of this Isle.</l>
            <l>How long in vain, had Nature striv'd to frame</l>
            <l>An acting Poet, till great <hi>Shakspher</hi> came;</l>
            <l>And thou the next wil't Rival him in Fame.</l>
            <l>Unknown Admirer, as I am of thee,</l>
            <l>Whom nothing could debauch to Poetry,</l>
            <l>But the strange Zeal I have to do thee Right,</l>
            <l>Maugre my Sex's weakness, Nature's spight.</l>
            <l>I'll hope good Nature so will interpose,</l>
            <l>You'll not these well-meant Lines a Jest expose</l>
            <l>To lashing Criticks, whose ill-natur'd rage</l>
            <l>Blow off young Blossoms in this <hi>Satirick</hi> Age.</l>
            <l>To th' blushing Flames let it committed be,</l>
            <l>In silence dye, there only slain—by thee,</l>
            <p>

Now <hi>I</hi> am not at all concern'd at this, nor do, or did <hi>I</hi>
ever write for Fame: And when <hi>I</hi> chance to write again, (as
indeed all my Works are hab nab at a Venture) if the Town
will be as kind to my next third day, as they were to my last,
<hi>I</hi> shall leave my Poetry to the utmost Severity of their Censure,
and end with an approv'd Saying, <hi>If I have their Money,
much good may do them with their Jests.</hi>

            <byline>Spoke by Mrs. Bracegirdle.</byline>
            <l>WEll, worthy Auditors, I am come again,</l>
            <l>To plead in the behalf of a weak Pen;</l>
            <l>Quaking within the expecting wretch does sit,</l>
            <l>To hear the dreadful sentence of the Pit.</l>
            <l>Some are resolv'd (he hears) it shall be damn'd,</l>
            <l>Only because 'tis from a Players hand;</l>
            <l>Sure we have acted some notorious Treason,</l>
            <l>You'll not allow the Men, nor do us reason;</l>
            <l>Our Women are as kind as may be too,</l>
            <l>But nothing but a Maist forsooth will do,</l>
            <l>And her twice had, rot her, she was not so;</l>
            <l>You turn her off upon some base pretence,</l>
            <l>So making her a fool, proves you have sense;</l>
            <l>How many of our poor deluded train,</l>
            <l>Have been took off the Stage and sent again.</l>
            <l>One day high dress'd as any intriegueing Sinner,</l>
            <l>The next, poor riggings pawn'd to buy 'em dinner,</l>
            <l>So from that greatness, still grow less and less,</l>
            <l>Commend me to a Huswife for a miss.</l>
            <l>Before the silly Creatures you debauch'd,</l>
            <l>You made high presents, some of 'em were caoch'd,</l>
            <l>Some on first floor did lodge, in plate did feast,</l>
            <l>And nothing but tit bits cou'd they ingest;</l>
            <l>Toys of all sorts, with Squirril, Lizzard, Parrot,</l>
            <l>And in three Months, O flesh! how cou'd they bear it,</l>
            <l>In clogs did beat the hoof, and lay in Garret;</l>
            <l>Some sparks have told me they wou'd do as much,</l>
            <l>If I had grace enough to be but such;</l>
            <l>Nay, I was offer'd fifty Skillings—<hi>Dutch.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But to our Author—</l>
            <l>Cou'd but the Females see, how very sad</l>
            <l>He looks, they'd pitty such a likely Lad,</l>
            <l>But hang him slave, he's married, there's the curse,</l>
            <l>Ah Devil for this better and for worse.</l>
            <l>Well Gallants, be impartial to him this day,</l>
            <l>If his Play's bad, dawn him indeed I say;</l>
            <l>But if by chance, he has writ it to your mind,</l>
            <l>As ever you expect my heart to find</l>
            <l>Inclinable to you, be kind to him,</l>
            <l>And Ladies if you smile, we doubt not them.</l>

                  <p>He can't be got with Child indeed, but for every thing else,
I think boys are full as troublesome: they're either given to Fighting,
Drinking, Gaming, or Whoring; If they're given to Fighting, Fifty

then probable the name of a Family is lost by it; if to Drinking,
why, if 'tis bad Wine it flings 'em into a feaver, which is damnable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive,
there's Doctors and Apothecaries, Rogues that get a Lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
by destroying of others; and kill or cure, they must be paid: which
is very hard upon the Subject; If to Gaming, why, If he has Indulgent
