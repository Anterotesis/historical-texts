            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Remonſtrance of the manners and behaviour
of the Iriſh Renegadoes, with many other
Paſſages very remarkable.</head>
            <p>THe Iriſh Renegadoes go not without the company of women,
whom they call their wives, but where they were married, or
by whom, or when, God knoweth: but inſtead of a ring, they
put a cord about their middles, and ſo it is concluded on very
ridiculouſly. Their travelling here is moſt commonly by their falſe
paſſes, which they make good in this manner. When they are in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
they know that whereſoever they land, they ſhalbe fitted with a
Scribe to make them any writing to fit them for any parts of England,
go they where they will, and commonly moſt of them are for london,
quickly getting acquaintance of Noblemens Footmen, and ſuch like, and
then they are ſure to be provided of any bodily ſuſtenance; and theſe kind
of people doe rob the poore and the lame of all ſuch proviſion as they
ſhould have given them at the gates.</p>
            <p>Now when theſe Renegadoes have beene ſo long in London, that
they have gotten ſtore of money and good cloaths, then downe they
come about S. James tide to Briſtoll in their old cloaths, and falſe Paſſes
made at London, becauſe they will beg by the way, and ſend their other
cloaths by the Carriers, and when they are at Briſtoll, away go the old
cloaths, and put on their new, and then have they a falſe landing briefe,
from Minhead or ſome other landing places neer adjoyning, and other
falſe writings, as if it came from ſome great man of authority in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
which ſhall certifie their great loſſes there, as if they were of the
Gentry indeed, when as they never lay in a bed of their own in all
their lives. They are exceeding prevailing by reaſon of the ſmoothneſſe
of their language, and get great ſtore of money; for the countrey-gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
and gentlewomen are ſoon won by them, giving them freely of
any thing their houſe affords, when the diſtreſſed people of our owne
nation ſhalbe ſent empty away, with ill words, and many times ſtripes
moſt cruelly. Theſe kinde of people live at great expences: I have
heard the Hoſteſſe of their Inne in Bodminſter Pariſh declare to ſome
the laſt S. James tide, that five of theſe begging rogues in ſix dayes ſpent
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61645:3"/>
ſeventeen pound at her houſe: and for their better ſort of apparell, it is
not mean, but of rich skarlet and gold lace: it may be thought, that they
play the parts of Gipſies, or Juglers, and break ſhops in London for
their coſtly things, which are of no ſmall price, but as one of them
ſaid, his ſuit of apparell was not ſo little worth as 35 pound. In the
time of Gondamores being here in England, he made great uſe of theſe,
and ſent them into all parts of the Kingdome for ſpies, giving them mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to buy perfumes and other trinkets; and by this means they as men
of trades ranged all the kingdome over, and were ſo perfect in the height
and ſtrength of all our forts, and alſo in knowing the ſhelves and depth
of all ports, that there was not any ſhipping, of what burden ſoever,
but they knew well where ſuch and ſuch a ſhip of any burden might ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive,
and where not.</p>
            <p>They are wonderfull intelligencers, and give great advantage to the
enemy: for not long ſince an Engliſh ſouldier being taken priſoner in
Spaine, and queſtioned before the Dons and other great ones appointed
for the time and place, they asked him how high the hoe at Plimmouth
was, and he told them it was very high; nay ſaid one of them, who
had a writing in his hand, it is no higher then a man may well leap over
with a ſtaffe: now there were behind him two Iriſh Friers who had
given this Noble-man this writing, with divers others the like, who
had been any where in our Kings Dominions for the advantage of the
King of Spaine their Maſter, as they affirmed.</p>
            <p>M. Scot, a worthy Divine, and the Preacher appointed to the Engliſh
Companies in Vtright in Holland, having declared in three Books the
damnable plots and devices of Gundamore whiles he was in England,
Gundamore vowed his death, and gave good ſtore of money to one of
theſe renegadoes, abſolved him of all his ſins (as this animall thought)
and ſent him into Holland to murder this good man: this villaine ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been in Holland a whole yeer and a halfe to that purpoſe, at length
came upon him unawares in a place where he meditated nigh the wals
of the City under Pine trees, with his ſword thruſt him through the
body, ſuppoſing he had kild him, and ran away with his ſword naked
in his hand; ſome ſouldiers being nigh at hand, met him, and held him,
whileſt others went to finde out the buſineſſe; and when they found
M. Scot groveling on the ground, they asked him how it was with him,
and who had done this villanous miſchief unto him? he anſwered, he
did not know: then they brought this man to him, who, when he ſaw
that he was not dead, was much vext, and ſaid, art thou yet alive? and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61645:3"/>
he ſaid, yea; and art thou he that haſt done this unto me? he ſaid, yea:
M. Scot ſaid, wherefore haſt thou done it? and he ſaid, if I have ſlaine
thee, I am ſaved; if not, I am damned: ſo M. Scot prayed God to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
this murderer, and to forgive him, and ſo died: and the other being
executed, repented not at all, but declared privately to ſome wherefore
he did it.</p>
            <p>An Engliſhman coming to Dublin, and being landed, he asked if he
might have any good lodging nigh at hand, an Iriſh man in a mantle hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it, told him, if he would go along with him, he ſhould have good;
the party went with him to a victualling-houſe, and ſitting down in a
chaire, called for ſome Tobacco (the Hoſteſſe being a widdow, and not
within) the Iriſh man told him he ſhould have it preſently: the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
man drew his purſe, wherein was good ſtore of coyne, and putting
his hand therein to draw out ſome money, the Iriſh man ſtanding by,
ſtabbed him with his skeane in divers places of the body, ſnatcht his
purſe from him, ran away, and threw his skene all bloudy over a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
doore where an Engliſh man being drunk lay aſleep. The Hoſteſſe
coming in and ſeeing a man ſitting in the chair as though he were aſleep,
went nigh him, and perceiving the blood run from him in abundance,
cried with a lowd voice to her neighbours, and ſaid, ſee here, the man is
wounded, and they coming in, the man preſently died, but none could
tell how: the Officers ſearching the houſe found an Engliſh man on a
bed ſleeping, and the skene in his chamber which the man was kild
withall, and they caried him to priſon, and this innocent man was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
for the Iriſh mans fact, as afterward the villain confeſſed. This
Iriſh man travelled toward Waterford, and went into an Engliſh mans
houſe on the way ſide not foure miles from Waterford, and ſtaid there
two dayes: his manner was to ſleep all day, and drink all night: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
market day on the Saturday at Waterford, it happened that a Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
rode by which knew the man of the houſe, and he called to him, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him how he did; the Hoſt anſwered, he thanked God, very well,
and made him drink; ſo away went the Tanner towards the market,
promiſing to ca<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l there again at his return: all this while the murderous
villain lay liſtening on his bed, ſuppoſing that the Tanner would receive
money at Waterford, and come there with it, thinking if he could get
him to drink with him by any wile, he ſhould pay deerly for it before
they parted. Now it came to paſſe as he returned that he drank with
him, and they were merry, and the Iriſh man kept him there till night,
ſo that he was fain to lodge with him: towards midnight, the Tanner
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61645:4"/>
being ſoundly aſleep, this villain cut off his head, and wrapped ſtraw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his body and it, and having a candle, and every body aſleep in the
houſe, he ſet the ſtraw on fire, and away he went, and took the Tanners
money, cloke, and horſe in the field, and rode to Waterford towards the
morning, and harboured himſelfe in an Iriſh Ale-houſe: all this while
the houſe burnt, the hoſt, his wife and daughter ſlept, untill the ſtraw in
the beds burnt their feet, and did not know how to help themſelves, but
all the houſe being burnt, they thought that the Tanner and their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
gueſt had been likewiſe burnt: but when they ſearcht, there was
nothing to be found but the Tanners bones, and his head ſevered from
his body: then they ſuſpected this villain, who took away the Tanners
horſe, and were confident of the trechery. Now ſome Iriſh neighbours
and a Conſtable came and apprehended the Hoſt and his daughter, and
ſaid, that they had robbed the Tanner of great ſtore of money, and burnt
the houſe of purpoſe; and ſo led them away to Waterford, and put them
in priſon, by the command of the Maior: but by great friendſhip they
got liberty for their daughter to beg food for them, and to ſeek for this
villain, and it happened, that as the maid was at the kay, prying to finde
him out, that he came (with the Tanners cloke on his back) unto a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of an Engliſh Bark, to agree for his paſſage for England, and the
maid knowing him by the cloke, cryed out alowd, and ſaid, This is the
man that hath burnt my Fathers houſe, and this is the Tanners cloke:
the villain hearing this, ran through a long ſtreet with his ſword drawn,
and no Iriſh man would ſtirre to take him: but a ſouldier ran on him,
and threw him down, and other ſouldiers did help to aid him; and being
brought before Sir George Flowre, he confeſt the burning of the houſe,
and on the gallowes, the other murder at Dublin, and he was hanged
and quartered for this petty treaſon.</p>
            <p>The rebels lately took an Engliſh Miniſter, and put him to wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
torments. Firſt they did ſaw his legs off in the middle, and then
after about the middle of the thighs, and then his arms above the wriſts,
and alſo above the elbow, and then cut two ſlices from his breſts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
charging him to alter his Religion, which he would not do for
all their tortures; then they took a hot iron and pierc'd it to his heart,
and ſo he died.</p>
            <p>The late Biſhop of Limrick, Doctor Web, a Wiltſhire man, a great
Scholler, and a worthy houſe-keeper, being in the Caſtle of Limrick as
long as the Caſtle held out, unto foure dayes, for he being buried in lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,
as fit as the time and place required, after the yeelding up of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61645:4"/>
ſaid Caſtle, when it was in the Rebels hands, they took him out of his
grave, and unſtript him out of his linnen, and abuſed his body very baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in a moſt barbarous manner, without all Chriſtianity or humanity.</p>
            <p>My Lord Eſmond, who commands the Fort of Dungarvan, and
hath done worthily in theſe late wars in Ireland, having one onely ſon,
who before the wars was thought to be a good Proteſtant, but is now
quite revolted, and ſides with the Rebels, and ſent his father word, that
if he could at any time come within reach of him, he would ſheath his
ſword in his bowels: his father receiving this anſwer, was much grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at it, having no more ſons. Since this his meſſage to his father, he
being then and always among the Rebels, who know not well what to
judge of him, ſent word to his Father, that if he would not yeeld up
the Fort of Dungarvan unto them, they would hang up his ſon: well,
ſaid my Lord, and I pray you do it; for if you do it not, if ever I take
him, I will. This is according to the Scripture; for in the latter age
ſhalbe the father againſt the ſon, and the ſon againſt the father. I pray
GOD be mercifull to us all.</p>
            <p>There was at S. JAMES tide laſt an Iriſh man which came newly
from Ireland, and went into Briſtoll, and a Warder that kept the gate,
with ſome others, took notice of him, and followed him; the Iriſh
man went boldly where the Maior was in the Tolſie, and delivered him
his landing briefe, hoping for a reward; it happened, that at the inſtant
that there was an Engliſh Gentleman in the Tolſie which came newly
from Ireland alſo, who beholding well this Iriſh mans countenance, at
length took hold of him, and ſaid, Gentlemen, this is the man which
rifled me in Ireland, and took from me any money and my cloaths, and
thereupon I will take my oath, and ſo he did, and they committed him
to priſon till the Seſſions.</p>
            <p>Many of the Iriſh that are lately come over into England, and have
robbed and undone many good Engliſh men, deny themſelves to be I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,
and ſay they are Scots: that ye may the better diſcover them, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
theſe directions following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Cauſe them to pronounce any word which hath the letter H In
it, as Smith, Faith, &amp;c. which they cannot do, not one among an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
but pronounce Smith, Smit; and Faith, Fait.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To know their Religion, cauſe them to ſay their prayers, as the
Pater Noſter and the Creed, in Engliſh, which they cannot well do.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Vncover their boſomes, moſt of them weare Crucifixes, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the women.</p>
            <p n="4">

4. Concerning their falſe paſſes, ſeparate them aſunder, and ſo exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them.</p>
            <p>Captain George Courtney, a man of great diſcent, ſon unto Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Courtney, of the houſe of Pawdra in Devonſhire, dwelling at
Newcaſtle in Munſter in Ireland, a man of great authority there, and
chiefe Conſtable of Limrick Caſtle and Askeiton, with many other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
under his command, being a man of other great revenues, and a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
houſe-keeper, and one that delighted to ſee his tenants thrive, hath
lately had a ſharp and bitter time of his being in the Caſtle of Limrick,
for he held out long after the city was in the enemies hands, and though
there was a great want of victuals and ammunition, ſo that many were
ſtarved, yet had it not beene more for their ſakes which were ready to
ſtarve then otherwiſe, he would never have come thence upon any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
or quarter; he is a man of an undaunted ſpirit, and nobly minded,
and religiouſly affected in the true way of a Proteſtant: the ſhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of my capacity is not able to give him the leaſt part of his well-deſervings,
but being a Warder formerly to the Caſtle of Limrick; I
preſumed to write part of his worth, not forgetting the valiant minde
of his eldeſt ſon Sir William Courtney, who lately hath adventured
himſelfe with a few in battell, againſt a multitude, and had a great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
of the Rebels.</p>
            <p>Of the barbarous cruelty of the Iriſh ye heare daily, being people of
no Religion, but as heathens, and cannot yeeld any account of their
faith, therefore let us think of them as they are; and ſo I leave them,
villanous and faithleſſe for the moſt part.</p>
            <p>There are two or three towns in Ireland, Waterford, Waſhford and
Dungarvan, very perillous for the advantage of the Rebels there, for of
late the Dunkerks have brought thither great ſtore of powder and other
ammunition, eſpecially at Dungarvan, and thoſe Dunkerks arrive daily
out of thoſe parts, and take Barks both of the Engliſh and Scots, and
bring in there, and the poore men of thoſe Barks are priſoners, and in
great miſery.</p>
            <p>Theſe things here inſerted, being of truth, and not falſe, are the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
worth obſerving, wherefore, Gentle Reader, affoord me your good
opinion, and I ſhalbe beholden unto you.</p>
