            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Here present unto your Lordship the <hi>Fruits,</hi> if not the Follies also, of my younger daies, not published now, if the audaciousnesse of some others had not made that <hi>necessary</hi> which in my own
<pb facs="tcp:54833:3"/>
thoughts was esteemed <hi>unseasonable.</hi> The reasons why I have no sooner published these Relations, and those which have inforced me to do it now, are laid down in the following Preface, sufficient (as I hope) both to excuse and justifie me with ingenuous men. But for my boldnesse in giving them the countenance of your Lordships name, I shall not study other reasons then a desire to render to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship some acknowledgement of those many fair expressions of esteem and favour, which your Lordship from my first coming to <hi>Westminster,</hi> hath vouchsafed unto me Your known abilities in most parts of learning, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the great respects you have for those which pretend unto it, encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned you to embrace such opinion of me, as was more answerable to your
<pb facs="tcp:54833:3"/>
own goodnesse then to my desert, and to cherish in me those Proficiencies, which were more truly in your self. And for my part, I alwaies looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Lordship as a true Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> devoted zealously to her Forms of worship, the ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxies of her Doctrine, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicism of her Government; which makes me confident that these pieces will not prove unwelcome to you, in which the superstitions &amp; innovations of the two opposite parties, are with an equal hand laid open to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships view. Nor shall you find in these Relations, such matters of compliance only with your Lordship in point of Judgement, as promise satisfaction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your intellectuall, and more noble parts; but many things which may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford you entertainments of a different
<pb facs="tcp:54833:4"/>
nature, when you are either spent with study, or wearied with affairs of more near importance. For here you have the principallest Cities and fairest Provinces of <hi>France</hi> presented in as lively colours, as my unpolished hand could give them; the Temper, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and Affections of the People, generally deciphered with a free and impartial Pen; the publick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole, in reference to the Court, the Church, and the Civil State, described more punctually then ever heretofore in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue; some observations intermingled of more ancient learning, but pertinent and proper to the businesse which I had in hand. You have here such an accompt also of some of the adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Islands (the only remainders of our Rights in the Dukedome of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy)</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:54833:4"/>
that your Lordship may finde cause to wonder, how I could say so much on so small a subject, if the great alterations which have hapned there in bringing in and working out the <hi>Genevian Discipline,</hi> had not occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned these enlargements.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may seem strange unto the Reader, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> after so large a volume of <hi>Cosmography,</hi> in which the world was made the subject of my Travels, I should descend unto the publishing of these <hi>Relations,</hi> which point at the estate only of some neighbouring places: or that in these declining times of my life and fortunes, I should take pleasure in communicating such <hi>Compositions,</hi> as were the products of my youth, and therefore proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly not able to endure the censure of severer age. And to say truth, there are some things in this <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication,</hi> whereof I think my self obliged to give an account to him that shall read these papers, as well for his satisfaction as mine own discharge; as namely touching the occasion of these several Journeys, my different manner of proceeding in these Relations, the reasons why not published sooner, and the impulsions which have moved me to produce them now.</p>
                  <p>For the two first, the Reader may be pleased to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> know, that as I undertook the first Journey, in the company of a private friend, only to satisfie my self in taking a brief view of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and delights of <hi>France;</hi> so having pleased my
<pb facs="tcp:54833:6"/>
publick view without his consent. For having tendred it unto him, it was no more mine, and not being mine, I had no reason to dispose otherwise of it, as long as the property thereof was vested in him by mine own free act. But he being laid to sleep in the bed of peace, I conceive my self to have gotten such a second right therein, as the <hi>Granter</hi> hath many times in Law, when there is no Heir left of the <hi>Grantee</hi> to enjoy the gift, and consequently to lay any claim unto it. And being resolved, upon the reasons hereafter following, to publish the first of these two Journals, I thought it not amisse to let this also wait upon it, second in place, as it had been second in performance and course of time.</p>
                  <p>So for the first Journey, being digested and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> unto writing for mine own contentment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the thought of pleasing any body else; the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it by me did as much conduce to the end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, as if it had been published to the view of others. And I had still satisfied my self in enjoying that end, if the importunity of friends (who were willing to put themselves to that charge and trouble) had not drawn some copies of it from me. By means whereof it came unto more hands then I ever meant it, and at the last into such hands, by which it would have been presented to the publick view without my consent; and that too with such faults and errors, as <hi>Transcripts</hi> of necessity must be subject to when not compared with the Original, or perused by the Author. And had it hapned so, as it was like enough to happen, and hath hapned since, the faults and errors of the Copy, as well as of the Presse, would have passed for mine; and I must have been thought accomptable for those
<pb facs="tcp:54833:6"/>
transgressions which the ignorance and unadvisednesse of other men would have drawn upon me. And yet there was some other reason, which made the publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Journal when first finished by me, not so fit nor safe, nor so conducible to some ends, which I had in view. I had before applyed my self unto his Majesty, when Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> by Dedicating to him the first Essayes of my <hi>Cosmographie;</hi> and thereby opened for my self a passage into the Court, whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I should have a minde to look that way. And at the time when I had finished these <hi>Relations,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> party there were as considerable for their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as it was afterwards for their power: and the discourse fashioned with so much liberty, and touching (as it might be thought) with so much <hi>Gayete de coeu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> upon the humours of that people, might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured me no good welcome; and proved but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsome harbinger, to take up any good lodging for me in that place, when either my studies should enable, or my ambition prompt me to aspire unto it. Which causes being now removed, I conceive the time to be more seasonable now, then it was at the first, and that these papers may more confidently walk the open streets, without giving any just offence to my self or others.</p>
                  <p>For though perhaps it may be said, that I have made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> too bold with the <hi>French,</hi> and that my character of that people, hath too much of the <hi>Satyrist</hi> in it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was intimated; yet I conceive that no sober minded man either of that Nation or of this, will finde himself aggrieved at my freedome in it. The <hi>French</hi> and other forein Nations make as bold with us, not sparing to lay open our wants and weaknesses, even
<pb facs="tcp:54833:7"/>
without occasion, and offering them by such multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> to the sight of others, as render them far greater then indeed they are. Men of facetious fancies and scoffing wits (as the <hi>French</hi> generally are) must not expect to be alwaies on the offering hand, but be content to take such money as they use to give; there would be else no living neer them, or conversing with them. <hi>Hanc veniam petimus<expan>

I doubt not but there are amongst them, many gallant women, of most exemplary vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and unquestioned chastity; and I believe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part are such indeed, though their behaviour at first sight might, to a man untravelled, perswade the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. But general characters are to be fitted to the temper and condition of a people generally, unto the <hi>Genera singulorum,</hi> as <hi>Logicians</hi> phrase it, though pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly (as there are few general Rules without some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions) many particular persons both of rank and merit, may challenge an exemption from them:</p>

                  <p>And it is possible enough I might have been more sparing of that liberty which I then gave unto my self, were there occasion to make a second character of

them at this present time; or had I not thought fit to have offered this discourse without alteration, as it first issued from my pen. Our <hi>English</hi> women at that time were of a more retired behaviour then they have been since, which made the confident carriage of the <hi>French Damosels,</hi> seem more strange unto me, whereas of late the garbe of our women is so altered, and they have so much in them of the mode of <hi>France,</hi> as easily might take off those misapprehensions, with which I was really possessed at my first coming thither. So much doth custome alter the true face of things, that it makes many things approvable, which at the first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unsightly.</p>
                  <p>In the next place it may be said that this short Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> deserves not to be called <hi>A SURVEY OF THE STATE OF FRANCE,</hi> considering that it only treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of some particular Provinces, and of such Towns and Cities only in those Provinces, as came within the compasse of a personal view. But then it may be said withall, that these four Provinces which I passed thorow, and describe, may be considered as the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome</hi> of the whole, the abstract or compendium of the Body of <hi>France:</hi> the Isle of <hi>France</hi> being look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on as the mother of <hi>Paris, Picardie</hi> as the chiefest <hi>Granary,</hi> and <hi>La Beause</hi> as the nurse thereof; as <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi> is esteemed for the Bulwark of all <hi>France</hi> it self by reason of that large Sea-coast, and well fortified Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, wherewith it doth confront the <hi>English.</hi> And if the rule be true in <hi>Logick</hi> (as I think it is) that a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination may be taken from the nobler parts; then certainly a <hi>Survey</hi> of these four Provinces, the noblest and most considerable parts of all that Kingdome, may be entituled without any absurdity the Survey of <hi>France.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:54833:8"/>
For besides that which hath been spoken, it was in these four Provinces that <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. did lay the scene of his long war against the <hi>Leaguers,</hi> as if in keeping them assured or subjected to him the safety of the whole Kingdome did consist especially. For though the war was carried into most other Provinces as the necessity of affairs required, yet it was managed in those Provinces by particular parties. Neither the King himself, nor the Duke of <hi>Mayenne</hi> (the heads of the contending Armies) did act any thing in them except some light velitations in <hi>Champagne,</hi> and one excursion into <hi>Burgundie;</hi> the whole decision of the quarrels, depending principally, if not wholly, in the getting of these. The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> had not else made so long a march from the Court of <hi>Bruxels,</hi> to raise the Kings Army from the siege of <hi>Roven;</hi> nor had the King mustered up all his wit and power to recover <hi>Amiens,</hi> when dexterously surprized by a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> stratagem. And if it be true, which the <hi>French</hi> generally affirm of <hi>Paris,</hi> that it is the Eye, nay the very Soul of all <hi>France</hi> it self; I may with confidence affirm, that I have given more sight to that Eye, more life and spirit to that Soul, then hath been hitherto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated in the English Tongue. The Realm of <hi>France</hi> surveyed in the four principal Provinces, and the chief Cities of the whole, gives a good colour to the <hi>title,</hi> and yet the title hath more colour to insist upon, then the description of these Cities, and those principal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, can contribute towards it. For though I have described those four Provinces only in the way of Chorography, yet I have took a general and <hi>a full Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the State of</hi> France, in reference to the Court, the Church, and the Civil State, which are the three
<pb facs="tcp:54833:9"/>
main limbs of all <hi>Bodies Politick,</hi> and took it in so full a manner, as I think none, and am assured that very few have done before me.</p>
                  <p>If it be said that my stay was not long enough to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> me exact and punctual in my observations: I hope it will be said withall, that the lesse my stay was, my diligence must be the greater, and that I husbanded my time to the best advantage. For knowing that we could not stay there longer, then our money lasted, and that we carried not the wealth of the <hi>Indies</hi> with us, I was resolved to give my self as little rest, as the necessities of nature could dispense withall; and so to work my self into the good opinions of some prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal persons of that nation, who were best able to inform me, as might in short space furnish me with such instructions, as others with a greater expence both of time and money could not so readily attain. By this accommodating of my self unto the humours of some men, and a resolution not to be wanting to that curiosity which I carryed with me, there was nothing which I desired to know (and there was nothing which I desired not to know) but what was readily imparted to me both with love and chearfulnesse. <hi>Cur nescire pudens prave quam discere mallem?</hi> I alwaies looked upon it as a greater shame to be ignorant of any thing, then to be taught by any body; and therefore made such use of men of both Religions, as were most like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to acquaint me with the counsels of their severall parties. Nor was I purse-bound when I had occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to see any of those Rarities, Reliques, and matters of more true antiquity, which either their Religious Houses, Churches, Colledges, yea, or the Court it self could present unto me. Money is never better
<pb facs="tcp:54833:9"/>
spent then wen it is layed out in the buying of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p>In the last place it may be said that many things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> have hapned both in the Court and State of <hi>France,</hi> many great revolutions and alterations in the face thereof since I digested the Relation of this Journey for my own contentment; which makes this publication the more unseasonable, and my consent unto it subject to the greater censure: which notwithstanding I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the discourse will be as usefull to the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Reader, as if it had gone sheet by sheet from the <hi>Pen</hi> to the <hi>Presse,</hi> and had been offered to him in that point of time when it took life from me. The learned labours of <hi>Pausanias</hi> in his Chorography of <hi>Greece,</hi> are as delightful now to the studious Reader, as formerly to the best wits of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Athens.</hi> Nor need we doubt, but that the description of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> by <hi>Lewis Guicciardine,</hi> and of the Isles of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> by our famous <hi>Camden,</hi> will yeeld as great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and contentment to future Ages, as to the men that knew the Authors. The Realm of <hi>France</hi> is still the same, the temperature of the air and soyl the same, the humours and affections of the people still the same, the Fractions of the Church as great, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as Regal or despotical now, as when the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was amongst them. The Cities stand in the same places which before they stood in, and the Rivers keep the same channels which before they had, no altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>natural</hi> parts of that great body, and not much in the <hi>politick</hi> neither. The change which since hath hapned by the Death of the King, being rather in the person of the Prince, then the form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Affairs of State then managed by a Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mother
<pb facs="tcp:54833:10"/>
and a Cardinal favourite, as they are at this present. The King in his Majority then, but not much versed or studied in his own concernments, as he is at this present; the Realm divided then into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and factions (though not into the same factions) as it is at this present; and finally, the <hi>English</hi> then in as high esteem, by reason of the alliance then newly made between the Princes, as they can possibly be now, by reason of the late concluded peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Nations. Nor hath there hapned any thing not reconcilable to the present times, but the almost miraculous birth of the King and his Brother after 20 years barrennesse, and the mariage of the Monsieur with <hi>Montpensiers</hi> Daughter, contrary to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall expectation of all that people, and for the first (I think I may be bold to say) of the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
                  <p>These reasons as they may excuse this publication,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> in reference to the work it self, so there is one which serves to justifie it in respect of the Author; that is to say, the manifesting of this truth to all which shall peruse these papers, that he is still of the same Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and opinion in matters of Religion, Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and the government of holy Church, of which he was 30 years agoe, when the Relation of the first Journey was fashioned by him; that he hath stood his ground in all those revolutions both of Church and State, which have hapned since; that he now holds no other <hi>Tenets,</hi> then those to which he hath been principled by education, and confirmed by study; and finally that such opinions as he holds, be they right or wrong, he brought to the Court with him, and took not from thence. So that whatsoever
<pb facs="tcp:54833:10"/>
other imputation may be charged upon him, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accused for a time-server, but alwaies constant to himself, in all times the same: <hi>Qualis ab incepto processer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Compare my late book upon the <hi>Creed,</hi> with these present <hi>Journals,</hi> and it will easily be seen, that in all points wherein I have occasion to declare my Judgement, I am nothing altered; that neither the temptations of preferment, nor that great turn both in the publick and my own affairs which hath hapned since, have made me other then I was at the very first.</p>
                  <p>It's true in reading over these papers as they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> were sent to the Presse, I found some things which I could willingly have rectified as they passed my hands; but that I chose rather to let them go with some <hi>Petit errors,</hi> then alter any thing in the Copy, which might give any the least occasion to this misconceit, that the work went not to the Presse, as it came from my pen, but was corrected by the line and levell of my present Judgement. And for such <hi>petit errors,</hi> as then scaped my hands, being they are but <hi>petit errors,</hi> they may the more easily be pardoned by ingenuous men. But howsoever being <hi>errors,</hi> though but <hi>petit</hi> errors, I hold it necessary to correct them, and shall correct them in this order as they come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me.</p>

Nor was I lesse diligent in gathering the materials for it, then carefull that it might be free from mistakes and errors; not only informing my self punctually in all things which concerned these Islands, by persons of most knowledge and experience, in the affairs and state of either, but with mine own hand copying out some of their Records, many whole Letters from the Councel and Court of <hi>England,</hi> the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>Genevian</hi> Discipline obtruded on both Islands by <hi>Snape</hi> and <hi>Cartwright,</hi> the Canons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by King <hi>James</hi> to the Isle of <hi>Jarsey,</hi> besides many papers of lesse bulk and consequence, out of all which I have so enlarged that discourse, that if it be not <gap reason="foreign">

Certain I am that here is more delivered of the affairs of these Islands and on their accompt, then all the Authors which have ever written of them being layed together, can amount unto. For in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of this part, I have took a <hi>full survey</hi> of those Islands which I went to visit, together with such al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in Religion as have hapned there, both when they were under the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Bishops of <hi>Constance,</hi> as since they have discharged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the power of both. The Reformation there being modelled according to the <hi>Genevian</hi> Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, occasioned me to search into the beginning, growth, and progresse of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> government with the setling of it in these Islands; together with the whole body of that Discipline as it was there set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb facs="tcp:54833:13"/>
and some short observations on the text thereof, the better to lay open the novelty, absurdity, and ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents of it. That done I have declared by what means and motives the Isle of <hi>Jars<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Lastly, I am to tell the Reader, that though I was chiefly drawn to publish these <hi>Relations</hi> at this present time, for preventing all impressions of them, by any of those false copies which are got abroad; yet I am given to understand, that the first is coming out (if not out already) under the Title of <hi>France painted out to the life:</hi> but <hi>painted</hi> by so short a <hi>Pensil,</hi> as makes it want much of that <hi>life</hi> which it ought to have. By whom and with what <hi>colour</hi> that piece is <hi>painted</hi> thus without my consent, I may learn hereafter. In the mean time, whether that Piece be printed with, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my name unto it, I must protest against the wrong, and disclaim the work, as printed by a false and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect copy, deficient in some whole Sections, the distribution of the books and parts, not kept according to my minde and method, destitute also of those <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications</hi> and <hi>Corrections,</hi> which I have given unto it on my last perusal in this general Preface; and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly containing but one half of the work which is here presented.

self with those imperfections, those frequent errors and mistakes which the audaciousnesse of other men may obtrude upon me: which having signified to the Reader, for the detecting of this imposture, and mine own discharge, I recommend the following work to his favourable censure, and both of us to the mercies of the Supreme Judge.</p>

                           <p>THe next ebb brought us in sight of the Sea-coast of <hi>Normandy,</hi> a shore so evenly compassed and levelled, that it seemeth the work of Art, not Nature; the Rock all the way of an equall height, rising from the bottom to the top in a perpendicular, and withall so smooth and polished, that if you dare believe it the work of Nature, you must also think, that Nature wrought it by the line, and shewed an art in it above the imitation of an Artist. This wall is the Northern bound of this Province; the South parts of it being confined with <hi>Le Mainde la Beausse,</hi> and <hi>L' Isle de France;</hi> on the East it is divided from <hi>Picardie</hi> by the River of <hi>Some;</hi> and on the North it is bounded with the Ocean, and the little River <hi>Crenon,</hi> which severeth it from a corner
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54833:26"/>
of <hi>Britain.</hi> It extendeth in length from the beginning of the 19 degree of longitude, to the middle of the 23. <hi>viz.</hi> from the Cape of St. <hi>Saviour</hi> West, to the Port-town of St <hi>Valerie</hi> East. For breadth, it lyeth partly in the 49, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the 50 degree of Latitude; so that reckoning 60 miles to a degree, we shall finde it to contain 270 <hi>English</hi> miles in length, and 60 <hi>English</hi> miles in breadth, where it is narrowest.</p>

A people which had so terribly spoyled the Maritine Coasts of <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Belgium,</hi> that, <hi>A furore Normannorum,</hi> was inserted into the Letanie. Originally they were of <hi>Norway,</hi> their name importeth it. <hi>Anno</hi> 800, or thereabouts, they began first to be accounted one of the Plagues of <hi>Europe:</hi> 900 they seated themselves in <hi>France</hi> by the permission of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Balde,</hi> and the valor of <hi>Rollo</hi> their Captain. Before this, they had made themselves masters of <hi>Ireland,</hi> though they long held it not, and <hi>anno</hi> 1067 they added to the glory of their name by the conquest of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> You would think them a people not only born to the warres, but to victory.

Liberty is the Mother and the Nurse of those two qualities and therefore the <hi>Romans</hi> (not unhappily) expressed both the conditions of a <hi>Freeman,</hi> and a <hi>discreet and modest personage,</hi> by this own word <hi>Ingenuus.</hi> Why the <hi>French</hi> King should lay a greater burden on the backs of this Nation, then their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, I cannot determine. Perhaps it is, because they have been twice conquered by them, once from King <hi>John,</hi> and again from <hi>Henry</hi> VI. and therefore undergo a double ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude. It may be, to abate their naturall pride and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornnesse.

from such practises. This a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman of good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding told me, that it was generally conceited in <hi>France,</hi> that the <hi>Normans</hi> would suddenly and unanimously betray their Countrey to the <hi>English,</hi> were the King a <hi>Catholick.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>—But there is yet a further cause of their beggerli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and poverty, which is their litigiousnesse and frequent going to law (as we call it.) <hi>Ortelius,</hi> however he failed in the first part of their character, in the conclusion of it hath done them justice. <hi>Mais en generall</hi> (saith he) <hi>ils sont scauans au possible en proces &amp; <unclear>plaideties</unclear>.</hi> They are prety well versed in the quirks of the Law, and have wit more then enough to wrangle.

                                 </gap>ere calleant.</hi> They are prety fellowes to finde out quirks in Law, and to it they will whatsoever it cost them. Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> spake not this at randome or by the guesse For besides what my self observed in them at my being once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, in a Colledge progresse, I have heard that there have been no lesse then 340 <hi>Nisi prius</hi> tryed there at one Assizes. The reason of this likenesse between the two Nations, I conjecture to be the resemblance of the site, and soil; both lie upon the Sea with a long and a spacious Coast; both enjoy a Countrey <hi>Champain,</hi> little swelled with hils, and for the most part of a light and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to no more particulars, if there be any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Provinces, it is only this, that the Countrey of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the people of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> are somewhat the richer.</p>
                           <p>For, indeed, the Countrey of <hi>Normandie</hi> is enriched with a fat and liking soil; such an one, <hi>Quae demum votis avari agricolae respondet,</hi> which may satisfie the expectation of the Husbandman, were it never so exorbitant. In my life I never saw Corn-fields more large and lovely, extended in an equall levell almost as far as eye can reach. The Wheat (for I saw little Barley) of a fair length in the stalke, and so heavy in the ear, that it is even bended double. You would think the grain had a desire to kisse the earth its mother, or that

it purposed by making it self away into the ground, to save the Plough-man his next years labour. Thick it groweth, and so perfectly void of weeds, that no garden can be imagined to be kept cleaner by Art, then these fields are by Nature. Pasture ground it hath little, and lesse Meddow, yet sufficient to nourish those sew Cattel they have in it. In all the way between <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Kine they have in some measure, but not fat nor large, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out these there were no living for them. The Nobles eat the flesh, whilst the Farmer seeds on Butter and Cheese, and that but sparingly. But the miserable estates of the <hi>Norman paisant,</hi> we will defer till another opportunity. Swine also they have in prety number, and some Pullen in their backsides; but of neither an excesse. The principall River of it is <hi>Seine,</hi> of which more hereafter; and besides this I saw two rivulets <hi>Robee</hi> and <hi>Renelle.</hi>

                           <p>In matter of Civill Government, this Countrey is directed by the court of <hi>Parliament</hi> established at <hi>Roven.</hi> For matters Military, it hath an Officer like the Lieutenant of our shires in <hi>England,</hi> the Governor they call him. The present Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is Mr. <hi>Le due de Longueville,</hi> to whom the charge of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince was committed by the present King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. <hi>anno</hi> 1619. The Lawes by which they are governed are the Civill or Imperiall, augmented by some Customes of the <hi>French,</hi> and others more particular which are the <hi>Norman.</hi> One of the principal'st is in matters of inheritance; the <hi>French</hi> custome giving to all the Sons an equality in the estate, which we in <hi>England</hi> call <hi>Gavelkind;</hi> the <hi>Norman</hi> dividing the estate into three parts, and thereof allotting two unto the eldest bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a third to be divided among the others.

This secureth the Haven from the violence of the weather, and is a great strength to the Town against the attempts of any forces which should assault it by Sea. The Town lying within these mountains, almost a quarter of a mile up the channell. The Town it self is not uncomely, the streets large and wel paved, the houses of an indifferent height, and built upright without any jettings out of one part over the other. The Fortifications, they say, (for we were not permitted to see them) are very good and modern; without stone, within earth: on the top of the hill, a Castle finely seated, both to defend the Town, and on occasions to command it. The Garrison consisteth of 60 men, in pay no more, but when need requireth, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hath authority to arme the Inhabitants. The present Governour is the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> who also is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the province, entrusted with both those charges

An action in which he swarved somewhat from the example of his father; who never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the military command of a Countrey (which is the office of the Governour) and the custody of a Town of war or a Fortresse, unto one man.

                           <p>The Kings of <hi>England</hi> have been well, and for a long time versed in this maxime of estate.

                           <p>But King <hi>Lewis</hi> now reigning in <hi>France,</hi> minded not his Fathers action; when at the same time also he made his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Mr. <hi>Luines</hi> Governor of <hi>Picardie,</hi> and of the Town and Citadell of <hi>Amiens.</hi> The time ensuing gave him a sight of this State-breach. For when the Dukes of <hi>Espernon, Vendosme, Longueville, Mayenne</hi> and <hi>Nemours,</hi> the Count of <hi>Soisons</hi> and others, sided with the Queen Mother against the King; the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> strengthned this <hi>Dieppe;</hi> and had not Peace suddenly followed, would have made it good, maugre the Kings forces. A Town it is of great importance, King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. using it as his <hi>Asylum</hi> or City of refuge, when the league was hottest against him. For, had he been further distressed, from hence might he have made an escape into <hi>England;</hi> and in at this door was the entance made for those <hi>English</hi> forces which gave him the first step to his throne. The Town hath been pillaged and taken by our <hi>Richard</hi> the first, in his war against <hi>Philip Augustus;</hi> and in the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our affaires in <hi>France,</hi> it was nine monthes together besieged by the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> but with that successe, which commonly attendeth a falling <hi>Empire.</hi> The number of the Inhabitants is about 30000, whereof 9000 and upwards are of the Reformation, and are allowed them for the exercise of their religion, the Church of <hi>Arques,</hi> a Village some two miles distant; the remainders are Papists. In this Town I met with the first <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which ever I yet saw, more then in my Books. <hi>Quos antea audiebam, hodie vidi Deos,</hi> as a barbarous <hi>German</hi> in <hi>Vellejus</hi> said to <hi>Tiberius.</hi> The Gods of <hi>Rome,</hi> which before I only heard of, I now saw, and might have worshipped. It was the <hi>Hoaste,</hi> as they call it, or the <hi>Sacrament reserved,</hi> carryed by a couple of <hi>Priests</hi> under a <hi>Canopie,</hi> ushered by two or three torches, and attended by a company of boyes and old people which had no other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. Before it went a Bell continually tinkling, at the sound whereof all such as are in their houses, being war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that then their God goeth by them, make some shew of reverence; those which meet it in the street, with bended
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54833:30"/>
knees and elevated hands doing it honour. The <hi>Protestants,</hi> of this Bell make an use more religious, and use it as a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or watch-peal to avoid that street through which they hear it coming. This invention of the Bell hath somewhat in it of <hi>Tureisme,</hi> it being the custome there at their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonieall</hi> houres, when they hear the criers bawling in the steeples, to fall prostrate on the ground wheresoever they are and kisse it thrice, so doing their devotions to <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The carrying of it about the streets hath, no question, in it a touch of the <hi>Jew,</hi> this ceremony being borrowed from that of carrying about the Arke on the shoulders of the <hi>Levites.</hi> The other main part of it which is the <hi>Adoration,</hi> is derived from the <hi>Heathens,</hi> there never being a people but they, which afforded divine honors to things inanimate. But the people indeed, I cannot blame for this Idolatrous devotion, their consciences being perswaded, that what they see passe by them, is the very body of their Saviour. For my part, could the like belief possesse my understanding, I could meet it with greater reverence, then their Church can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn me. The Priests and Doctors of the people are to be condemned only, who impose and inforce this sin upon their hearers. And doubtlesse there is a reward which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth them for it. Of standing it is so young, that I never met with it before the year 1215. Then did Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> ordain in a Councell holden at <hi>Rome,</hi> that there should be a <hi>Pix</hi> made to cover the Bread, and a Bell bought to be rung before it. The Adoration of it was enjoyned by Pope <hi>Honorius, anno</hi> 1226. both afterward encreased by the new solemn feast of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> day, by Pope <hi>Urban</hi> the IV. <hi>anno</hi> 1264. and confirmed for ever with multitudes of pardons, in the Councell of <hi>Vienna,</hi> by <hi>Clement</hi> the V. <hi>anno</hi> 1310. Such a punie is this great God of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. Lactantius</hi> in his first Book of <hi>Institutions</hi> against the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> taxeth the wise men of those times of infinite ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculousnesse, who worshipped <hi>Jupiter</hi> as a God, <hi>Cùm eun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem tamen Saturno &amp; Rhea genitum confiterentur,</hi> Since them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so perfectly knew his originall. As much I marvell at the impudencie of the <hi>Romish</hi> Clergie, who will needs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a new God upon their people, being so well acquainted with his cradle.</p>

Horses we could get none for money, and for love we did not expect them. We are now mounted in our Chariot, for so we must call it. An <hi>English</hi> man would have thought it a plain Cart, and if it needs will have the honour of being a Chariot, let it; sure I am it was never ordained for triumph. At one end was fastned three carcasses of horses, or three bodies which had once been horses, and now were worne to dead images; had the <hi>Statua</hi> of a man been placed on any one of them, it might have been hanged up at an Inne door, to represent St. <hi>George</hi> on horseback, so livelesse they were, and as little moving; yet at last they began to crawle, for go they could not. This converted me from my former Heresie, and made me apprehend life in them: but it was so little, that it seemed only enough to carry them to the next pack of houndes. Thus accommodated we bid farewell to <hi>Dieppe,</hi> and proceeded with a space so slow, that me thought our journey unto <hi>Roven</hi> would prove a most perfect embleme of the motion of the ninth sphere, which is 49000 years in finishing.

Church of the <hi>Dieppe</hi> Protestants. Their Preachers Mr. <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mondenis,</hi> who have each of them an yearly sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend of 40l. or thereabouts; a poor pay, if the faithfull discharge of that duty were not a reward unto it self, above the value of gold and silver. To instance in none of those beggerly Villages we past through, we came at last unto <hi>Tostes,</hi> the place destinated to be our lodging; a Town somewhat like the worser sort of Market-towns in <hi>England.</hi> There our <hi>Chareter</hi> brought us to the ruines of an house, an Ale house I should scarce have thought it, and yet in spight of my teeth it must be an Inne, yea and that an honorable one, as <hi>Don Quixotes</hi> hoste told him. Despair of finding there either Bedding or Victuals, made me just like the fellow at the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, who when he might have been reprieved on condition he would marry a wench which there sued for him, having viewed her well, cryed to the hangman <hi>to drive on his Cart.</hi> The truth is, <hi>I' esehappay la tonnnere et rencheus en l' eschair,</hi> according to the <hi>French</hi> proverb; I fell out of the frying-pan into the fire. One of the house (a ragged fellow I am sure he was, and so most likely to live there) brought us to a room somewhat of kindred to a Charnel-house, as dark and as dampish. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it was paved with brick at the bottom, and had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Orchards a prety hole, which in former times had been a window, but now the glasse was all vanished. By the little light which came in at that hole, I first perceived that I was not in <hi>England.</hi> There stood in this Chamber three beds, if at the least it be lawfull so to call them; the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them was of straw, so infinitely thronged together, that the wool-packs which our <hi>Judges</hi> sit on in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were melted butter to them: upon this lay a medley of flocks and feathers sowed up together in a large bag; (for I am confident it was not a tick) but so ill ordered, that the knobs stuck out on each side, like a crab-tree cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell. He had need to have flesh enough that lyeth on one of them, otherwise the second night would wear out his bones. The sheets which they brought us, were so course, that in my conscience no Mariner would vouchsafe to use them for a sail; and the coverlet so bare, that if a man would undertake to reckon the threads, he need not misse

one of the number. The napperie of the Table was sutable to the bedding, so foul and dirty, that I durst not conceive it had been washed above once; and yet the poor clothes looked as briskly as if it had been promised for the whole year ensuing, to scape many a scouring. The napkins were fit companions for the clothes, <hi>Vnum si noveris, omnes nosti.</hi> By my description of this <hi>Inne,</hi> you may guesse at the rest of <hi>France;</hi> not altogether so wretched, yet is the alteration al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most insensible.</p>
                           <p>Let us now walke into the <hi>Kitching,</hi> and observe their provision. And here we found a most terrible execution committed on the person of a pullet; my Hostesse (cruell woman) had cut the throat of it, and without plucking off the feathers, tore it into pieces with her hands, and after took away skin and feathers together, just as we strip Rabbets in <hi>England:</hi> this done, it was clapped into a pan, and fryed into a supper. In other places where we could get meat for the Spitte, it useth to be presently broached, and laid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly over the fire; three turns at the most dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, and bringeth it to the Table, rather scorched then roasted. I say where we could get it, for in these rascally Innes, you cannot have what you would, but what you may; and that also not of the cheapest. At <hi>Pontoyse</hi> we met with a Rabbet, and we thought we had found a great purchase; larded it was, as all meat is in the Countrey, otherwise it is so lean, it would never endure roasting. In the eating it proved so tough, that I could not be perswaded, that it was any more then three removes from that Rabbet which was in the Ark. The price half a Crown <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</hi> My companions thought it over deer, to me it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very reasonable; for certainly the grasse which sed it, was worth more then thrice the money. But to return to <hi>Tostes.</hi>

                           <p>And it it time; you might, perchance, else have lost the sight of mine Hostesse, and her daughters. You would have sworne at the first blush, they had beeu of a bloud; and it had been great pity had it been otherwise. The salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Horace, Omatre pulchra filia pulchrior,</hi> was never so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable as here. Not to honour them with a further

character, let it suffice that their persons kept so excellent a <hi>decorum</hi> with the house and furniture, that one could not possible make use of <hi>Tullies Quàm dispari dominaris domina.</hi> But this is not their luck only. The women not of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi> alone, but generally of all <hi>France,</hi> are forced to be contented with a little beauty; and she which with us is reckoned with the vulgar, would amongst them be taken for a Princesse. But of the <hi>French</hi> women, more when we have taken a view of the Dames of <hi>Paris;</hi> now only some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of their habit and condition. Their habit in which they differ from the rest of <hi>France,</hi> is the attire of the head, which hangeth down their backs in the fashion of a Vail. In <hi>Roven</hi> and the greater Cities, it is made of linen, pure and decent; here, and in the Villages, it cannot possible be any thing else then an old dish-clout turned out of service, or the corner of a tablecloth reserved from washing. Their best conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not alwayes visible. They shew it only in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, or when you are ready to depart, and that is their beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging; you shall have about you such a throng of those ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces, and every one whining out this <hi>dity, Pour les servants,</hi> that one might with greater ease distribute a dole at a rich mans Funerall, then give them a penny. Had you a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to give them unasked, their importunity will prevent your speediest bounty. After all this impudent begging, their ambition reacheth no higher then a <hi>Sol;</hi> he that giveth more out-biddeth their expectation, and shall be counted a spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift.</p>
                           <p>But the principall ornaments of these Innes, are the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servants, the raggedest regiment that ever I yet looked upon. Such a thing as a <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> was never heard of amongst them, and good clothes are as little known as he. By the habit of his attendants, a man would think himself in a Gaol; their clothes either full of patches, or open to the skin. Bid one of them wipe your boots, he presently hath recourse to the curtains, with those he will perhaps rub over one side, and leave the other to be made clean by the guest. It is enough for him, that he hath written the coppy. They wait al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with their hats on their heads, and so also do servants before their masters: attending bare-headed, is as much out

of fashion there, as in <hi>Turkey:</hi> of all <hi>French</hi> fashions, in my opinion, the most unfitting and unseeming. Time and much use reconciled me to many other things, which at the first were offensive; to this unreverent custome, I returned an enemy. Neither can I see how it can choose but stomach the most patient, to see the worthyest signe of liberty usurped and profaned by the basest of slaves. For seeing that the <hi>French paisantrie,</hi> are such infinite slaves unto their Lords and Princes, it cannot be, but that those which are their servants, must be one degree at the least, below the lowest condition.</p>
                           <p>Certainly among the antients, this <hi>promiseuous covering</hi> of the head, was never heard of. It was with them the chief sign of freedome, as is well known to those which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant with Antiquity.

                           <p>July the first we set on for <hi>Roven.</hi> In 10 hours our Cart dragged us thither, the whole journey being in all six leagues <hi>French:</hi> admirable speed! About three of the clock in the afternoon we had a sight of the Town, daintily seated in a valley on the River <hi>Seine.</hi> I know not any Town better situate, <hi>Oxford</hi> excepted, which indeed it much resembleth; I mean not in bignesse, but situation: It stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on all sides evironed with mountains, the North ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and hath a large and pleasant walk of meadowes by the river side, to the South-east-ward; as <hi>Oxford</hi> hath towards <hi>Eveley.</hi> It is seated on the principall river of <hi>France,</hi> distant from the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of that Country 50 miles <hi>English,</hi> or thereabouts; as <hi>Oxford</hi> on the <hi>Thames,</hi> and from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> Watered also it is with two small rivulets, <hi>Robee</hi> and <hi>Renelle,</hi> as the other with <hi>Charwell</hi> and <hi>Eventode.</hi> The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, that <hi>Oxford</hi> is seated somewhat higher on the swelling of an hill, and a little more removed from those mountains which environ it: and that the rivers which run through some part of <hi>Roven,</hi> do only wash the precincts of the other. The buildings are in some places wood, in some stone, in other both; the houses without juttings or

                           <p>The other buildings of note are the bridge (for I as yet omit the Hosue of Parliament and the Churches) and the Town wall by it. The bridge, whilst it was all standing, was thought to have been the fairest and strongest piece of that kinde in all <hi>France.</hi> It consisteth of twelve arches, large and high: there now remain but seven of them, the rest being broken down by the <hi>English</hi> in the falling of their affairs in <hi>France,</hi> the better to make good the Town against the <hi>French.</hi> The river is here about the breadth of the <hi>Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In breadth up to the wall-ward 30 yards, in length 100; a fine walke in fair weather. All along the banke side lay the ships, which by reason of the broken bridge come up thither, and on occasions higher: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The seat and Church of the Archbishop is that of <hi>Nostre dame,</hi> a building far more gorgeous in the cutside, then within. It presents it self to you with a very gracious and majesticall front, decked with most curious imagery, and adorned with three stately Towers. The first <hi>La tour de beurre</hi> (because it was built with that money which was raised by Cardinall Dr. <hi>Amboyse,</hi> for granting a dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to eat butter in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Within it is but plain and ordinary, such as common Cathedrall Churches usually are, so big, so fashioned. Behinde the high Altar, at a pillar on the left had, is the remainder of the Duke of <hi>Bedfords</hi> Tomb: which for ought I could discerne, was nothing but an <hi>Epitaph</hi> some three yards high in the pillar. I saw nothing in it, which might move the envie of any Courtier to have it defaced, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it were the title of <hi>Regent du Royaume de France,</hi> which is the least he merited.</p>
                           <p>Somewhat Eastward, beyond this is our Ladies Chappell, a prety neat piece, and daintily set our. There standeth on the top of the screen, the image of the Virgin her self, between two Angels. They have attired her in a red mantle, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

A jolly plump Ladie she seemeth to be, of a flaxen hair, a ruddy lip, and a chearefull complexion.

Twere well the Painters would agree about limming of her, otherwise we are likely to have almost as many Ladies, as Churches. At <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                                 </gap>stre dame</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> she is taught us to be browne, and seemeth somewhat inclining to melancholie. I speak not of her different habit, for I envie not her changes of apparell Only I could not but observe how those of St. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres</hi> Church, <hi>en la Bue</hi> St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> have placed her on the top of their Skreen, in a Coape, as if she had taken upon her the zeal of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and were going to make a bloudy sacrifice of her Son. They of <hi>Nostre dame</hi> in <hi>Amiens,</hi> have erected her <hi>Statua</hi> all in gold, with her Son also of the same mettle in her armes; casting beams of gold round about her, as the Sun is painted in its sull glory: strange Idolatries! On the contrary, in the Parish Church of <hi>Tury,</hi> in <hi>La Beausse,</hi> she is to be seen in a plain petticoat of red, and her other garments correspondent. In my minde this holdeth most proportion to her estate, and will best serve to free their irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from absurdity. If they will worship her as a nurse, with her childe in her arme, or at her brest, let them array her in such apparell, as might beseem a Carpenters wife; such as she may be supposed to have worn before the world had taken notice, that she was the mother of her Saviour. If they needs must have her in her estate of glory, as at <hi>Amiens;</hi> or of honour (being now publickly acknowledged to be the <hi>blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est among women</hi>) as at <hi>Paris,</hi> let them disburden her of her child. To clap them thus together, is a folly, equally worthy of scorne and laughter. Certainly had she but so much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to make choice of her own clothes, I doubt not but she would observe a greater <hi>decorum.</hi> And therefore I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the <hi>Capuchins</hi> of <hi>Boulogne,</hi> who in a little side-chappell consecrated unto her, have placed only a handsome fair looking-glasse upon her Altar, the best ornament of a female closet: why they placed it there, I cannot say, only I conceive it was, that she might there see how to dresse her self.</p>
                           <p>This Church is said to have been built (I should rather think repaired) by <hi>Raoul</hi> or <hi>Rollo,</hi> the first Duke of <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi> since it hath been much beautifyed by the <hi>English</hi> when they were Lords of this Province.

It is much altered from what it was in the time of the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> few of the words in which our lawes were written being known by them. One of our company gave a <hi>Litleton's tenure,</hi> written in that language, to a <hi>French</hi> Doctor of the Lawes; who protested that in three lines, he could not understand three words of it. The religion in this Town is indifferently poized, as it also is in most places of this Province.

                              <hi>JUly</hi> the second we take our farewell of <hi>Roven,</hi> better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated then we came thither; yet not so well as I defired. We are now preferred <hi>ab Asinis ad equos,</hi> from the Cart to the Waggon. The <hi>French</hi> call it a Coach, but that matters not; so they would needs have the Cart to be a Chariot. These Waggons are the ordinary instruments of travell in those Countries; much of a kin to <hi>Gravesend</hi>'s barge. You shall hardly finde them without a knave or a Giglot. A man may be sure to be merry in them, were he as certain to be wholesome. This, in which we travelled, contained ten persons, as all of them commonly do; and amongst these ten, one might have found <hi>English, Scots, French, Normans, Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> a jolly medley; had our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons been as different as our Nations, I should have thought my self in <hi>Amsterdam</hi> or <hi>Poland;</hi> if a man had desired to have seen a Brief or an Epitome of the World, he would no where have received such satisfaction, as by looking on us. I have already reckoned up the several Nations, I will now lay open the severall conditions. There were then to be found amongst these ten passengers, men and women, Lords and serving men, Scholars and Clowns, Ladies and Chambermaids, Priests and Laie-men, Gentlemen and Artificers, people of all sexes and almost all ages. <hi>If all the learning in the world were lost, it might be found again in Plutarch,</hi> so said <hi>Budaeus.</hi> If all the Nations in the world had been lost, they might have been found again in our Waggon, so I. Seriously I think our
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54833:37"/>
Coach to have been no unfit representation of the Ark. A whole world of men and languages might have grown out of it.</p>
                           <p>But all this while our Waggon joggeth on, but so leisure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it gave me leave to take a more patient view of the Countrey, then we could in the Cart. And here, indeed, I saw sufficient to affect the Countrey, yea to dote on it, had I not come out of <hi>England.</hi> The fields such as already I have described, every where beset with Apple-trees, and fruits of the like nature. You could scarce see any thing which was barren in the whole Journey. These Apples are both meat and drink to the poor <hi>Paisant.</hi> For the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is ill provided with Vines (the only want I could observe in it) and Beer is a good beverage at a Gentlemans table, Sider then, or Perry are the poor mans Claret; and happy man is he, which once or twice a week can aspire so high a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove water. To proceed, through many a miserable Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage (<hi>Burghs</hi> they call them) and one Town somewhat big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then the rest, called <hi>Equille;</hi> we came that night to St. <hi>Claire</hi> 10 <hi>French</hi> miles from <hi>Roven,</hi> a poor Town god wot, and had nothing in it remarkable, but an accident. There dwelt a monk there, grown into great opinion for his sanctity, and one who had an especiall hand upon sore eyes; yet his ability herein was not generall, none being capable of cure from him but pure Virgins. I perswade my self <hi>France</hi> could not yield him many patients: and yet from all parts he was much sought unto. Hope of cure and a charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion, which they had of themselves, had brought to him divers distressed Damosels; which, I am confident, had no interest in his miracle. In the same Inne (Alehouse I should say) where we were to be harbored, there had put in a whole convoy of these <hi>Ladies errant, Pilgrims</hi> they called themselves, and had come on foot two dayes journey to cleer their eye-sight. They had white vailes hanging down their backs, which in part covered their faces; yet I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by a glimpse, that some of them were past cure. Though my charity durst allow them maids, it was afraid to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them Virgins: yet so far I dare assure them they should recover their sight, that when they came home, they should
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54833:38"/>
see their folly. At that time, what with too much watching on shipboard, what with the tartnesse of the water, and the violence of the winde, working upon me for almost 40 houres together whilst I lay on the Hatches: mine eyes had gotten a rheum and a rednesse: my Hostess (good woman) perswaded me to this holy Eye-wright, but I durst not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Not that I had not as good a title to my Virginity as the best there: but because I had learned what a grievous sentence was denounced on <hi>Ahaziah</hi> king of <hi>Israel,</hi> for seeking help of <hi>Belzebub</hi> the god of <hi>Eckron.</hi> When I hap to be ill, let my amendment come on Gods name. <hi>Mallem semper profanus esse, quam sic religious,</hi> as <hi>Minutius Foelix</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Sacrifices. Let my body rather be stil troubled with a sore eye, then have such a recovery to be a perpetuall eye-sore to my conscience. Rather then go in Pilgrimage to such a Saint, let the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists count me for an Heretick. Besides, how durst I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine in him an ability of curing my bodily eyes, who had for above 70 years been troubled with a blindnesse in the eyes of his soul?—<hi>Thou fool</hi> (said our Saviour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in the like case) <hi>first cast out the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye.</hi>

                           <p>The next morning (<hi>July</hi> 3) I left my pilgrims to try their fortunes, and went on in our journey to <hi>Paris,</hi> which that day we were to visite. My eyes not permitting me to read, and my cares altogether strangers to the <hi>French</hi> chat, drave my thoughts back to <hi>Roven;</hi> and there nothing so much possessed me, as the small honour done to <hi>Bedford</hi> in his monument. I had leasure enough to provide him a longer Epitaph, and a shorter apologie against the envie of that Courtier, which perswaded <hi>Charles</hi> the VIII to deface the ruines of his Sepulchre: Thus.</p>

It is commodiously situate on the rising of an hill, and is famous for the siege laid before it by <hi>Charles</hi> VII <hi>anno</hi> 1442. but more fortunate unto him in the taking of it. For having raised his Army upon the Duke of <hi>Yorks</hi> coming to give him battail with 6000 only; the <hi>French</hi> Army consisting of double the number; he retired or fled ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto St. <hi>Denis;</hi> but there hearing how scandalous his retreat was to the <hi>Parisians</hi> even ready to mutiny; and that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> and others of the Princes, stirred with the ignominiousnesse of his flight, began to practise against him; he speedily returned to <hi>Pontoyse,</hi> and maketh himself master of it by assault.

in its limited sense, and as a part only of the whole, for when <hi>Meroveus,</hi> the Grandchild of <hi>Pharamond,</hi> first King of the <hi>Franci</hi> or <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> had taken an opportunity to passe the <hi>Rhine,</hi> having also during the wars between the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Gothes,</hi> taken <hi>Paris;</hi> he resolved there to set up his rest, and to make that the head City of his Empire.

                        <p>This Isle, this portion of <hi>Gaul,</hi> properly and limitedly styled <hi>France,</hi> was the seat of the <hi>Francs</hi> at their first coming hither, and hath still continued so. The rest of <hi>Gallia,</hi> is in effect rather subdued by the <hi>French,</hi> then inhabited; their valour in time having taken in those Countries which they never planted: so that if we look apprehensively into <hi>Gaule,</hi> we shall finde the other Nations of it, to have just cause to take up that complaint of the King of <hi>Portugall</hi> against <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Castile,</hi> for assuming to himself the title of <hi>Catholick King of Spain; Ejus tam non exigua parte penes reges alios,</hi> as <hi>Mariana</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth it. Certain it it, that the least part of all <hi>Gallia</hi> is in the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Normans, Britons, Biscaines</hi> or <hi>Gascons,</hi> the <hi>Gothes</hi> (of <hi>Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Provence) Burgundians,</hi> and the antient <hi>Gaules</hi> of <hi>Poictou,</hi> retaining in it such fair and ample Provinces. But it is the custome (shall I say) or fate of lesser and weaker Nations, to lose their names unto the stronger; as wives do to their husbands, and the smaller ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to the greater. Thus we see the little Province of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54833:41"/>
                           <hi>Poland</hi> to have mastered and given name to the <hi>Pruteni, Mazovii,</hi> and other Nations of <hi>Sarmatia Europaea;</hi> as that of <hi>Mosco</hi> hath unto all the Provinces of <hi>Asiatica.</hi> Thus hath <hi>Sweden</hi> conquered and denominated almost all the great <hi>Peninsula</hi> of <hi>Scandia;</hi> whereof it is but a little parcell: and thus did the <hi>English Saxons</hi> being the most prevailing of the rest, impose the name of <hi>English</hi> on all the people of the <hi>Hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchie.</hi>
                           <q>Et dedit imposito nomina prisca jugo.</q>
And good reason the vanquished should submit themselves as well unto the appellation, as the laws of the victor. The <hi>French</hi> then are possessors of some parts of old <hi>Gallia,</hi> and masters of the rest; possessors not of their Cities only, but their conditions. A double victory, it seemeth, they enjoyed over that people, and took from them at once, both their qualities and their Countries. Certainly whosoever will please to peruse the Commentaries of <hi>Julius Caesar, de bello Gallico;</hi> he will equally guesse him an Historian and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; yea he will rather make himself believe, that he hath prophecied the character of the present <hi>French,</hi> then delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red one of the antient <hi>Gaule.</hi> And indeed, it is a matter wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy both of wonder and observation, that the old <hi>Gaules,</hi> being in a manner all worne out, should yet have most of their conditions surviving in those men, which now inhabit that region, being of so many severall Countries and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. If we dive into naturall causes, we have a speedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course unto the powerfull influence of the heavens; for as those celestiall bodies considered in the generall, do work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all sublunary bodies in the generall, by light, influence and motion; so have they a particular operation on parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. An operation there is wrought by them in a man, as borne at such and such a minute; and again as borne under such and such a Climate. The one derived from the setting of the Houses, and the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Horoscope</hi> at the time of his Nativity; the other from that constellation which governeth as it were, the Province of his birth, and is the <hi>genius</hi> or <hi>deus tutelaris loci.

Their attempts on <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Millain</hi> (to omit their present enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise on <hi>Genoa</hi>) are manifest proofs of it; neither will I now speak of the battail of <hi>Poicteirs,</hi> when they were so forward in the onset, and furious in the flight. <hi>Vt sunt Gallorum subita ingenia,</hi> saith <hi>Caesar:</hi> &amp; I think this people to be as hare-brained as ever were the other. <hi>Juvenal</hi> calleth <hi>Gallia, foecunda causidicorum:</hi> and among the modern <hi>French</hi> it is related, that there are tryed more law causes in one year, then have been in <hi>England</hi> since the Conquest. Of the antient <hi>Germans,</hi> the next neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and confederates of the <hi>Gaules, Tacitus</hi> hath given us this note, <hi>Diem noctemque continuare potando nulli probrum;</hi> and presently after, <hi>De jungendis affinitatibus, de bello denique &amp; pace, in conviviis consultant.</hi> Since the time of <hi>Tacitus</hi> hath <hi>Germanie</hi> shifted almost all her old inhabitants, and received new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies of <hi>Lombards, Sueves, Gothes, Sclavonians, Hunns, Saxons, Vandals,</hi> and divers other Nations not known to that writer. Yet still is that exorbitancy of drinking in fashion; and to this day do the present <hi>Germans</hi> consult of most of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in their cups. If the <hi>English</hi> have borrowed any thing of this humor, it is not to be thought the vice of the Countrey, but the times. To go yet higher and further, the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Anacharsis</hi> (and he lived 600 and odd yeers before Christ) noted it in the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that at the beginning of their feasts, they used little goblets, and greater towards the end, when they were now almost drunken, <gap reason="foreign">

Their Empire indeed they have lost, their valour, learning, and all
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54833:42"/>
other graces which set them out in the sight of the World; and no marvell these were not nationall conditions, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall endowments. I conclude then this digression with the words of <hi>Barklay, Haeret itaque in omni gente vis quedam inconcus sa, quae hominibus pro conditione terrarum, in quibus na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>The present <hi>French</hi> then, is nothing but an old <hi>Gaule</hi> moulded into a new name, as rash he is, and as head strong, and as hare brain'd. A nation whom you shall win with a feather, and lose with a straw. Upon the first sight of him you shall have him as familiar as your sleep, or the necessity of breathing. In one houres conference, you may indeer him to you, in the second unbutton him; the third pumps him drie of all his secrets, and he gives them you as faithfully, as if you were his ghostly father, and bound to conceal them <hi>sub sigillo confessionis:</hi> when you have learned this, you may lay him aside, for he is no longer serviceable. If you have an humor of holding him in a further acquaintance, (a favour of which he consesseth, and I believe him, he is unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy:) himself will make the first separation. He hath said over his lesson to you, and must now finde out some body else to whom to repeat it. Fare him well, he is a garment whom I would be loath to wear above two days together, for in that time he will be thread-bare. <hi>Familiare est homini om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia sibi remittere,</hi> saith <hi>Velleius</hi> of all; it holdeth most properly in this people. He is very kind-hearted to himself, and thinketh himself as free from wants, as he is full: so much he hath in him of the nature of a <hi>Chinoy's,</hi> that he thinketh all men blind but himself. In this pride of self-conceitednesse he hateth the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> loveth not the <hi>English,</hi> and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the <hi>German;</hi> himself is the only Courtier, and compleat Gentleman; but it is his own glasse which he seeth in, out of this conceit of his own excellency, and partly out of a shallownesse of brain; he is very liable to exceptions. The least distast that can be, draweth his sword, and a minutes pause sheathes it to your hand. If afterwards you beat him into better manners, he shall take it kindly and cry <hi>serviteur.</hi> In this one thing they are wonderfully like the Devill. Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or submission maketh them insolent, a little resistance
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54833:43"/>
putteth them to their heels, or makes him your Spaniel. In a word (for I have held him too long) he is a walking vanity in a new fashion.</p>
                        <p>I will now give you a taste of his table, which you shall finde in a measure furnished; (I speak not of the <hi>Paisant:</hi>) but not in so full a manner as with us. Their Beef they cut out in so little chops, that that which goeth there for a laudable dish, would be thought here to be an University commons, new served from the hatch. A loine of Mutton serves amongst them for three roastings, beside the hazard of making pottage with the rump. Fowle also they have in good plenty, especially such as the King found in <hi>Scotland.</hi> To say truth, that which they have is sufficient for nature and a friend, were it not for the Mistresse of the Kitchin-wench. I have heard much fame of <hi>French</hi> Cooks, but their skill lyeth not in the handling of Beef or Mutton. They have (as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have all this Nation) good fancies, and are speciall fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes for the making of puffe-pastes, and the ordering of banquets. Their trade is not to feed the belly, but the palat. It is now time you were set down, where the first thing you must do, is to say your own Grace; private Graces are as ordinary there, as private Masses: and from thence I think they learned them. That done, fall to where you like best. They observe no methods in their eating, and if you look for a Carver, you may rise fasting. When you are risen, if you can digest the sluttishnesse of the cookery, (which is most abominable at first sight) I dare trust you in a Garrison. Follow him to Church, and there he will shew himself most irreverent and irreligious; I speak not this of all, but of the generall. At a Masse in the <hi>Cordeliers</hi> Church in <hi>Paris,</hi> I saw two <hi>French Papists,</hi> even when the most sacred mystery of their faith was celebrating, break out into such a blasphemous and Atheisticall laughter, that even an <hi>Ethnick</hi> would have hated it. It was well they were known to be <hi>Catholicks;</hi> otherwise some <hi>French</hi> hot-head or other, would have sent them laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Pluto.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>French</hi> language is, indeed, very sweet and delectable. It is cleared of harshnesse, by the cutting off, and leaving out the consonants, which maketh it fall off the tongue very vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubly;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54833:43"/>
yet in my opinion, it is rather elegant then copious, and therefore is much troubled for want of words to find out periphrases. It expresseth very much of it self in the action. The head, body, and shoulders concurre all in the pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of it; and he that hopeth to speak it with a good grace, must have somewhat in him of the <hi>Mimick.</hi> It is inriched with a full number of significant Proverbs, which is a great help to the <hi>French</hi> humor of scoffing; and very full of courtship, which maketh all the people complementall. The poorest Cobler in the Village hath his Court-cringes, and his <hi>eau be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niste de Cour,</hi> his court holy water, as perfectly as the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the Passados of their court-ship, they expresse themselves with much variety of gesture, and indeed, it doth not misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them. Were it as gratious in the Gentlemen of other Nations as in them, it were worth your patience; but the affectation of it is scurvy and ridiculous. <hi>Quocunque salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis artificio corpus inflectant, putes nihil ista institutione magis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venire. Vicinae autem gentes ridiculo errore deceptae, ejusdem venustatis imitationem ludicram faciunt &amp; ingratam:</hi> as one happily obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at his being amongst them. I have heard of a young Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, son to a great Lord of one of the three <hi>Brittish</hi> Kingdoms, that spent some years in <hi>France</hi> to learn fashions. At his return he desired to see the King, and his father procured him an entervenie. When he came within the Presence-chamber, he began to compose his head, and carry it as if he had been ridden with a Martingall: next he fell to draw back his legs and thrust out his shoulders, and that with such a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse apishnesse, that the King asked him if he meant to shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him out of his chair, and so left him to act out his comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the hangings. In their courtship they bestow even the highest titles, upon those of the lowest condition. This is the vice also of their common talk. The begger begetteth <hi>Monsieurs</hi> and <hi>Madams</hi> to his sons and daughters, as familiarly as the King. Were there no other reason to perswade me, that the <hi>Welch</hi> or <hi>Britains</hi> were the descendants of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> this only were sufficient, that they would all be Gentlemen.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="40" facs="tcp:54833:44"/>His discourse runneth commonly upon two wheels, <hi>treason</hi> and <hi>ribaldrie.</hi> I never heard people talke lesse reverently of their Prince, nor more sawcily of his actions. Scarce a day passeth away without some seditious Pamphlet printed and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, in the disgrace of the King, or of some of his Courtiers. These are every mans mony, &amp; he that buyeth them is not coy of the Contents, be they never so scandalous; of all humors the most base and odious. Take him from this (which you can hardly do, till he hath told all) and then he falleth upon his ribaldry. Without these crutches, his discourse would never be able to keep pace with his company. Thus shall you have them relate the stories of their own uncleannesse, with a face as confident, as if they had no accidents to please their hearers more commendable. Thus will they reckon up the severall profanations of pleasure, by which they have dismanned themselves; sometimes not sparing to descend to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. A valiant Captain never gloried more in the number of the Cities he had taken, then they do of the severall women they have prostituted.

                        <p>I Am come to the <hi>French</hi> Women, and it were great pity they should not immediately follow the discourse of the men, so like they are one to the other, that one would think them to be the same, and that all the difference lay in the apparell. For person, they are generally of an indifferent stature, their bodies straight, and their wastes commonly small: but whether it be so by nature, or by much restraining of these parts, I cannot say. It is said, that an absolute woman should have (amongst other qualities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite) the parts of a <hi>French</hi> woman from the neck to the girdle; but I believe it holdeth not good, their shoulders and backs being so broad, that they hold no proportion with their midles; yet this may be the vice of their apparell. Their hands are, in mine opinion, the comliest and best ordered part about them, long, white and slender. Were their faces answerable, even an <hi>English</hi> eye would apprehend them lovely: but herein do I finde a <hi>pretty contradictorie.</hi> The hand, as it is the best ornament of the whole structure, so doth it most disgrace it. Whether it

be that ill diet be the cause of it, or that hot bloud wrought upon by a hot and scalding aire, must of necessity by such means vent it self, I am not sure of. This I am sure of, that scarce the tithe of all the maids we saw, had her hands and arme wrists free from sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>bs, which had over run them like a leprosie. Their hair is generally black, and indeed, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what blacker then a gracious lovelinesse would admit. The Poets commend <hi>Leda</hi> for her black hair, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily.

Yet was that blacknesse but a darker brown; and not so fearfull as this of the <hi>French</hi> women. Again, the blacknesse of the hair is then accounted for an ornament, when the face about which it hangeth, is of so perfect a complexion and <hi>symmetrie,</hi> that it giveth it a lustre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then doth the hair set forth the face, as a shadow doth a picture; and the face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the haire, as a <hi>field-argent</hi> doth a <hi>sable-bearing,</hi> which kind of Armory the <hi>Heralds</hi> call the most fairest. But in this the <hi>French</hi> women are most unluckie. <hi>Don Quixote</hi> did not so deservedly assume to himself the name of <hi>The Knight of the ill-favoured face,</hi> as may they, that of the <hi>damosels</hi> of it. It was therefore a happy speach of a young <hi>French</hi> gallant that came in our company out of <hi>England,</hi> and had it been spoken amongst the Antients, it might have been registred for an Apophthegme; that the <hi>English</hi> of all the people in the world were only <hi>nati advoluptates.</hi> You have (saith he) the fairest women, the goodliest horses, and the best breed of dogs, under heaven. For my part, as far as I could in so short a time observe, I dare in this first believe him. <hi>England</hi> not only being (as it is said) <hi>a paradise for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> by reason of their priviledges; but also <hi>a paradise of women,</hi> by reason of their unmatchable perfections.</p>
                        <p>Their <hi>dispositions</hi> hold good intelligence with their faces. You cannot say to them as <hi>Sueton</hi> doth of <hi>Galba, Ingenium Galbae male habitat.</hi> They suit so well one with another, that in my life I never met with a better <hi>decorum;</hi> but you

must first hear them speak. <hi>Loquere ut te videam,</hi> was the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in old times, and it holdeth now. You cannot gather a better character of a <hi>French</hi> woman, then from her prating, which is so tedious and infinite, that you shall sooner want ears, then she tongue. The <hi>fastidious</hi> pratler which <hi>Horace</hi> mentioneth in his ninth <hi>Satyre,</hi> was but a <hi>puisnè</hi> to her. The writers of these times, call the <hi>Sicilians, Gerrae Siculae,</hi> and not undeservedly; yet were they but the Scholars of the <hi>French,</hi> and learned this faculty of them, before the Vespers. It is manners to give precedency to the Mistresse, and she will have it, if words may carry it. For two things I would have had <hi>Aristotle</hi> acquainted with these Starlings. First, it would have saved him a labour in taking such paines about finding out the perpetuall motion. Secondly, it would have freed him from an Heresie with which his Doctrine is now infected, and that is, <hi>Quiquid movetur, ab alio movetur;</hi> their tongues, I am certain move themselves, and make their own occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of discoursing. When they are going, they are like a watch, you need not winde them up above once in twelve houres, for so long the thread of their tongues will be in spinning. A dame of <hi>Paris</hi> came in Coach with us from <hi>Roven;</hi> fourteen houres we were together, of which time (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Such everlasting talkers are they all, that they will sooner want breath then words, and are never silent, but in the grave; which may also be doubted. As they are endlesse in their talk, so also are they regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of the company they speak in. Be you stranger or of their acquaintance, it much matters not; though indeed, no man is to them a stranger. Within an hour of the first sight, you shall have them familiar more then enough, and as merry with you, as if they had known your bearing-clothes. It may be they are chaste, and I perswade my self many of them are; but you will hardly gather it out of their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. <hi>Te tamen &amp; cultus damnat,</hi> as <hi>Ausonius</hi> of an honest woman that carried her self lesse modestly. They are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly full of laughter and toying, and are never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out variety of lascivious Songs; which they spare not to sing in what company soever. You would think modesty

were quite banished the Kingdom; or rather, that it had never been there. Neither is this the weaknesse of some few. It is an epidemicall disease, Maids and Wives are alike sick of it, though not both so desperately; the galliardy of the maids, being of the two a little more tolerable; that of the women coming hard upon the confines of <hi>shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse.</hi> As for the Ladies of the Court, (I cannot say this, but upon hear-say) they are as much above them in their lightnesse, as they are in their place; and so much the worse in that they have made their lightnesse impudent. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the daughter of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> being demanded what most shamed her to discourse of, made answer <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>those parts which made her woman:</hi> these <hi>French</hi> dames will speak of them, even in the hearing of men, as freely, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as broadly, as a Midwife, or a Barber-surgeon. Nay, I have heard a Gentleman of good credence relate, that being at a tilting, he saw a Courtier going to remove a boy, which very roguishly looked under a Ladies clothes: but when her Ladiship perceived his intention, she hindred him with this complement, <hi>Laisse, Monseuir, laisse, les yeuxne sont pas larrens;</hi> the boyes eyes would steal nothing away; a very mercifull and gentle Lady. If that of <hi>Justine</hi> be still true, <hi>Vera mulierum ornamenta pudicitiam esse, non vestes;</hi> that modesty were the best apparell of a woman; I am afraid many of the female sex in <hi>France</hi> would be thinly clad, and the rest go naked.</p>
                        <p>Being a people thus prone to a suddain familiarity, and so prodigall of their tongue and company, you would scarce imagine them to be coy of their lips. Yet this is their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor. It seemed to me strange at first and uncivill, that a woman should turn away from the proffer of a salutation. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward I liked the custome very well, and I have good cause for it, for it saved me from many an unsavory piece of manner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse. This notwithstanding could not but amazeme, that they who in their actions were so light and wanton, should yet think themselves modest, and confine all lasciviousnesse unto a kisse. A woman that is kissed, they account more then half whored, be her other deportment never so becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which maketh them very sparing of receiving such kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54833:46"/>
But this is but a dissembled unwillingnesse, and hath somewhat in it of the <hi>Italian.</hi> For as they had rather mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a man in private, then openly speak ill of him: so it may be thought that these Damosels would hardly resuse a mans bed, though education hath taught them to flie from his lip. Night and the curtains may conceal the one: the other can obtain no pardon in the eye of such, as may happen to observe it.</p>
                        <p>Upon this ground your <hi>French</hi> Traveller, that perhaps may see their Hostesse kissed at <hi>Dover,</hi> and a Gentleman salute a Lady in the streets of <hi>London;</hi> relateth at his coming home, strange <hi>Chimera</hi>'s of the <hi>English</hi> modesty. To further this si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister opinion, he will not spare to tell his <hi>Camerades</hi> (for this I have noted to you, to be a part of his humor) what Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants wives he enjoyed in <hi>London;</hi> and in what familiarity such a Lady entertained him at <hi>Westminster.</hi> Horrible untruths! and yet my poor gallant thinketh he lyeth not. I remember I met in <hi>Paris</hi> with an <hi>English</hi> Doctor and the Master of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there, who complained much of the lasciviousness of the <hi>English</hi> women: and how infamously every <hi>French</hi> Taylor that came from us, reported of them: withall, he protested, that it did not grieve him much, because he thought it a just judgement of God upon our Nation, that all the married men should be cuckolds. A strange piece of Divinity to me who never before had heard such preaching: but this was the reason of the Doctrine: In the old <hi>English</hi> Masse-book called <hi>Secundum usum Sarum,</hi> the woman at the time of marriage, promiseth her suture husband to be <hi>bonny and buxom at bed and at board, till death us depart, &amp;c.</hi> This being too light for the gravity of the action then in hand, and in mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion somewhat lesse reverend then a Church duty would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; the reformers of that book thought good to alter: and have put in the place of it, <hi>to love, cherish and obey.</hi> That this was a sufficient assurance of a conjugal faith, he would not grant; because the promise of being <hi>Buxom</hi> in bed was excluded. Besides he accounted the supposed dishonesty of the <hi>English</hi> wives, as a vengeance plucked down upon the heads of the people, for chopping and changing the words of the holy Sacrament: (for such they esteem the form of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54833:47"/>
Matrimony) though his argument needed no answer, yet this accusation might expect one: and an <hi>English</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (though not of the <hi>English</hi> Faith) thus laid open the abuse; and seemed to speak it out of knowledge. When the <hi>Monsieurs</hi> come over full pursed to <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>French Pandars,</hi> which lie in wait for such booties, grow into their acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: and promise them the embraces of such a Dame of the City, or such a Lady of the Court; women perchance famed for admirable beauties. But as <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Thus are they cousen'd in their desires, thus do they lie in their reports: whilest poor souls, they think themselves guilty of neither impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.</p>
                        <p>For the other accusation, which would seem to fasten a note of immodesty upon our <hi>English</hi> womens lips: I should be like enough to confess the crime, were the <hi>English</hi> kisses like unto those of the <hi>French.</hi> As therefore Dr. <hi>Dale</hi> Master of the Requests, said unto <hi>Mendoza</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador, upon his dislike of the promiscuous sitting of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in our Churches; <hi>Turpe quidem id esse apud Hispanos qui etiam in locis sacris cogitarent de explenda libidine, a qua procul aberant Anglorum mentes:</hi> So do I answer to the bill of the complainant. An <hi>Oxford</hi> Doctor upon this text, <hi>Betrayest thru the Son of man with a kisse?</hi> made mention of four man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of kisses, <hi>viz. Osculum charitatis, osculum gratioris familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, osculum calliditatis,</hi> and <hi>osculum carnalitatis.</hi> Of these I will bestow the last on the <hi>French,</hi> and the third on the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards;</hi> retaining the two first unto ourselves: whereas the one is enjoyned by the precept, and the other warranted by the examples of holy Scripture. For my part, I see nothing in the innocent and harmless salutations of the <hi>English,</hi> which the Doctor calleth <hi>Osculum gratioris familiaritatis,</hi> that may move a <hi>French mans</hi> suspicion; much I confess to stir his envie. Perhaps a want of the like happiness to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self maketh him dislike it in us: as the Fox that had lost his taile, perswaded all others to cut off theirs; but I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

touched the reason, why that Nation is unworthy of such a favour: their kisses being hot and sulphury, and indeed nothing but the prologue to their lusts. Whereas on the contrary, and I dare be confident in it; the chaste and innocent kisse of the <hi>English</hi> Gentlewomen, is more in heaven, then many of the best of their devotions.

                        </lg>
                        <p>Which must be understood according to the fashion of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> (and since of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>); where they were given as pawns of a dishonest contract: and not according to the customes of <hi>England,</hi> where they are only proffer'd in way of a gracious and innocent familiarity; and so accepted.</p>
                        <p>I return again to the <hi>French</hi> women; and though I may not kisse them (which he that seeth them will swear I have good cause to thank God for) yet they are at liberty to be courted: an office which they admit freely, and return as liberally. An office to which they are so used; that they can hardly distinguish complement from wooing, till the Priest expecteth them at the Church door.

                        <p>I Have now done with the <hi>French,</hi> both men and women: a people much extolled by many of our <hi>English</hi> Travellers, for all those graces which may enoble &amp; adorn both sexes. For my part, having observed them as well as I could,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54833:49"/>
and traced them in all their several humors: I set up my rest with this proposition, that <hi>there is nothing in them to be envied but their Countrey.</hi> To that indeed I am earnestly, and I think not unworthily affected: here being nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which may be required, to raise and reward ones liking. If nature was ever prodigal of her blessings, or scattered them with an over-plentiful hand; it was in this Island: into which we were entred, as soon as we passed over the bridge of <hi>Pontoyse.</hi> The first part of it, which lasted for three leagues; was upon the plain of a mountain: but such a mountain, as will hardly yeeld to the best valley in <hi>Europe,</hi> out of <hi>France.</hi> On both sides of us the Vines grew up in a just length, and promised to the husbandman a thriving vintage. The Wines they yeeld are far better then those of <hi>Normandy,</hi> or <hi>Gascoyne;</hi> and indeed the best in the whole Continent, those of <hi>Orleans</hi> excepted: yet what we saw here, was but as a bit to prepare our stomachs; lest we should surfeit in the valley.</p>
                        <p>Here we beheld nature in her richest vestiments. The fields so interchangeably planted with Wheat and Vines, that had <hi>L. Florus</hi> once beheld it, he would never have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto <hi>Campania</hi> the title of <hi>Cereris &amp; Bacchi certamen.</hi> These fields were dispersedly here and there, beset with Cherry trees; which considered with the rest, gave unto the eye an excellent object. For the Vines yet green; the Wheat ready for the fithe; and the cherries now fully ripened, and shewing forth their beauties through the vails of the leaves: made such a various and delightsome mixture of colours, that no art could have expressed it self more delectably. If you have ever seen an exquisite Mosaical work, you may the best judge of the beauty of this valley. Add to this, that the River <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This valley is of a very large circuit; and as the <hi>Welch men</hi> say of <hi>Anglesey.

It is seated within a mile of <hi>Paris,</hi> high upon a mountain: on which many of the faithfull, during the time that <hi>Gaule</hi> was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish, were made Martyrs. Hence the name. Though <hi>Paris</hi> was the place of apprehension and sentence, yet was this Mountain commonly the scaffold of execution: it being the custome of the ancients, neither to put to death, nor to bury within the wals of their Cities. Thus the <hi>Jewes</hi> when they crucified our Saviour, led him out of the City of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> unto Mount <hi>Calvarie:</hi> unto which St. <hi>Paul</hi> is thought to allude, Heb. 13. saying, <hi>Let us therefore go forth

There he fell down and died, being three <hi>English</hi> miles from <hi>Mont-martre:</hi> and there he was buried together with <hi>Rusticus,</hi> and <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> who not being able to go as fast as he did, were brought after him by the people. <hi>O im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <p>To the memory of this Saint, did <hi>Dagobert</hi> the first build a Temple: and the times ensuing improved it to a Town. Afterwards in honour of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> and because it lay neer <hi>Paris;</hi> some of the following Kings bestowed a wall upon it. A wall it is of a large circuit, and very much unpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the Town, which standeth in it, for all the world like a <hi>Spaniards</hi> little face in his great ruffe, or like a small chop of Mutton in a large dish of pottage at the three penny Ordinary. Thus was the Town built (as you see) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

Thus, then saith the story. <hi>Diagobert</hi> afterwards King of <hi>France,</hi> during the life of <hi>Clotoyre</hi> the second his Father, had cruelly slain <hi>Sadrasegille</hi> his governour. To avoid the fury of his Father, much incensed with that unprincely action; he was compelled to wander up and down <hi>France</hi> hungry and thirsty. And so he went, and he went, (for this tale should be told in the same stile, that wenches tell theirs by the fire side) till he came to the Sepulchre of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> where he laid down and slept: and then there appeared unto him a fine old man, with a staffe in his hand, and he told him that his father was dead, and that he should be King, and he prayed him of all loves, that when he came to be King, he would build a Church there, in the honour of St. <hi>Denis.</hi> He had an hard heart, that could deny so sweet an old man so little a courtesie, for so much good newes, and I trow the King was more kinde then so. And so when the Church was built, the Bishop was sent for in all haste to blesse it. But it chanced that the night before the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Bishop was to blesse it, there came to the Town an ugly Leper, and the foulest that ever was seen: and this Leper would needs lie in the Church. And when he was there, about twelve a clock at night, our Saviour came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church in garments as white as the driven snow, and there came with him the Apostles, and the Angels and the Martyrs, and the sweetest Musick that ever was heard in the world. And then Christ blessed the Church, and said unto the Leper, that he should tell the Bishop that the Church was already blessed, and for a token of it, he gave the Leper his health, who presently became as fine a sweet youth as one should see in a summers day. <hi>Auditum admissi risum teneatis?</hi> you may laugh if you please, but I'le assure you this is the story: neither is it a jot the lesse authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick because of the stile. Such ridiculous stuffe, did the Fryers and Munks of those times invent to please and blinde the people. So prone were our Ancestors to believe as Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, what ever was delivered unto them by these Impostors. <hi>Majoritus nostris tam facilis in mendaciis fides fuit, ut temere credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derint etiam monstrosa miracula: &amp; quicquid famae licet fingere, illis erat libenter laudire.

But I will not stand to this <hi>etymologie.</hi> The names of great Cities are as obscure as those of their founders; and the conjecturall derivations of them are oftentimes rather plausible then probable; and sometimes neither. As for the antiquity of it, it is said to be built in the time of <hi>Amasia</hi> King of <hi>Judah;</hi> but this also is uncertain: the beginnings of antient Cities, being as dark and hidden, as the reasons of their names.

                        <p>The other name of this City, which is indeed the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and was taken from the situation of it, is <hi>Lutetia,</hi> from <hi>lutum</hi> dirt; as being seated in an exceeding clammy and dirty soil. To this also consenteth the abovenamed <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Breton,</hi> in his said first Book of the <hi>Phillippiades,</hi> saying,</p>

If you will believe <hi>Comines</hi> in the first book of his Histories, he will tell you, that <hi>Cest la citè que jamais ie veisse environneè de meilleux pais et plantureux;</hi> of all the Cities which ever he saw, it is environed with the best and fruitful'st Countrey. The river of <hi>Seine</hi> is also, no question, a great help to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of it; for though it be not Navigable unto the Town, yet it giveth free passage unto boats of an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent big burden, into which the ships are unladen, and so their commodities carryed up the water. A profitable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse between the Sea and the City for the Merchants. Of these boats there are an infinite company that plie up and down the water, and more indeed, as the said <hi>Comines</hi> is of opinion, than any man can believe that hath not seen them.</p>
                        <p>It is in circuite, as <hi>Boterus</hi> is of opinion, 12 miles. Others judge it at 10. For my part, I dare not guesse it to be above 8; and yet I was told by a <hi>French</hi> man, that it was in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe no lesse then 14 leagues within the wals; an untruth bigger then the Town.

Joyne the compasse and the populousnesse together, and you shall hear the wisest of the <hi>French</hi> men say, that <hi>Que ce qu'est l' ame a la raison, el la prunelle a l' oeil; cela mesme est Paris a la France.</hi> Add to this the verdict of <hi>Charles</hi> V. who being demanded which he thought to be the biggest City of <hi>France:</hi> answered, <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                                 <desc>•…</desc>

The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour did well to flatter <hi>Francis</hi> the first, who asked him these questions, and in whose power he then was; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he might have given men good cause to suspect his judgement. The truth is, that <hi>Paris</hi> is a fair and goodly Town; yet withall, it is nothing like the miracle that some men make it. Were the figure of <hi>London</hi> altered, and all the houses of it cast into a Ring; I dare able it a larger and more goodly Town then <hi>Paris,</hi> and that in the comparison, it may give it at the least half a mile oddes.</p>
                        <p>For matter of strength and resistance, certain it is that this City is exceeding well seated, were it as well fortifyed. It lyeth in a plain flat levell, and hath no hils nigh unto it, from which it can any way be annoyed; and for the casting and making of rowling-trenches, I think the soil is hardly serviceable. If Art were no more wanting to the strength of it then Nature, in mine opinion, it might be made almost impregnable. <hi>Henry</hi> IV. seeing the present weaknesse of it, had once a purpose (as it is said) to have strengthned it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the modern art of Fortifications.

                        <p>The present strength of the Town then is not great, the wals being very weak and ruinous; and those other few helps which it hath, being little availeable for defence. The beautiful lest part of the whole resistance is the ditch, deep, precipitate and broad; and to say no more of it, an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ward, were there any thing else correspondent to it. As for the Fort next unto St. <hi>Antonies</hi> gate, called the <hi>Bastille;</hi> it is in my conceit too little to protect the Town, and too low to command it. When Swords only and Pick-axes were in use, and afterwards in the infancie of guns, it did some service in the nature of a Fortresse: now it serveth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally as a prison for those of the greater sort, who will permit themselves to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Others, of the more learned sort, make it to be the work of one of the Provosts of the City. <hi>Du Chesne</hi> calleth him <hi>Hugues Aubriot,</hi> in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> V. when as yet the <hi>English</hi> had nothing to do here. The word <hi>Bastille</hi> in generall, signifieth a Fortresse; the article <hi>la,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed before it, maketh it a name, and appropriateth it unto this building. There are also two little turrets, just against the gallery of the <hi>Louure,</hi> on both sides of the <hi>Seine,</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the defence of the River; though now they are little able to answer that intention: they also are fathered on the <hi>English,</hi> but how true I know not. An other place I marked, designed perhaps for a Rampart, but imployed at this time only by windmils. It is a goodly mount of earth, high and capacious, situate close unto the gate called St. <hi>Martins;</hi> the most defensible part, if wel manned, of all <hi>Paris.</hi> Thus is the strength of this Town (as you see) but small; and if <hi>Henry</hi> IV. lay so long before it with his Army, it was not because he could not take it, but because he would not.

But concerning the ridiculous bravery of the poor <hi>Parisian,</hi> take along with you this story: Upon our first coming into <hi>Paris,</hi> there came to visit a <hi>German Lord,</hi> whom we met a ship-bord, a couple of <hi>French Gallants,</hi> his acquaintance; the one of them (for I
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54833:60"/>
did not much observe the other) had a suit of <hi>Turkie grogram</hi> doubled with Taffeta, cut with long slashes, or carbona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do's, after the <hi>French</hi> fashion, and belaied with bugle lace. Through the openings of his doublet appeared his shirt of the purest Holland, and wrought with curious needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work; the points at his waste and knees, all edged with a silver edging; his garters, roses and hat-band, sutable to his points; a beaver hat, and a pair of silk ftockins; his cloke also of <hi>Turkey grogram,</hi> cut upon black Taffeta. This Lord (for who would have dared to guesse him other?) applyed himself to me, and perceiving my ignorance in the <hi>French,</hi> accosted me in <hi>Latine,</hi> which he spake indifferently well. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some discourse, he took notice of mine eyes, which were then sore and sea-sick, and promised me, if I would call on him at his lodging the next morning, to give me a water, which suddenly would restore them to their strength and vigor. I humbly thanked his Lordship for such an ineffable and immerited favour, in the best complement and greatest obeisance I could devise. It was not for nought, thought I, that our <hi>English</hi> extoll so muth the humanity of this people; nay I began to accuse the report of envy, as not having published the one half of their graces and affabilities. <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillum enim virtutum illarum acceperim!</hi> And thus taking my leave of his Honor, I greedily expected the next morning. The morning come, and the hour of visiting his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship almost at hand, I sent a servant to fetch a Barber to come trim me and make me neat, as not knowing what occasion I might have, of seeing his Lady or his daughters.

It is a very fair and awfull building, adorned with a very beautiful front, and two towers of especiall height. It is in length 174 paces, and 60 in bredth: and is said to be as many paces high: and that the two towers are 70 yards higher then the rest of the Church. At your first entrance on the right hand, is the effigies of St. <hi>Christopher,</hi> with our Saviour on his shoulders. A man, the Legend maketh him as well as the Mason, of a gyant like stature; though of the two, the Mason's workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is the more admirable: his being all cut out of one main stone; that of the <hi>Legendary</hi> being patched up of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fabulous and ridiculous shreds: it hath in it four ranks of pillars 30 in rank; and 45 little Chappels, or Masse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closets, built between the outermost range of pillars, and the wals.

Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> who is said to be the father of it, gave it the gift of purifying and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying all which it washed: <hi>Ut cuncti illa aspersi purificentur, &amp; sanctificentur,</hi> saith his Decretall. The <hi>Roman Rituall</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished and confirmed by <hi>Paulus</hi> 5. maketh it very soveraign, <hi>ad abigendos daemones, &amp; spiritus immundos.

                        <p>The second superstition which this Church shewed me was the continuall burning of a Lamp before the Altar, a ceremony brought into the Churches (as it is likely) by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> 3. <hi>anno</hi> 1215. at what time he ordained that there should a pix be bought to cover the bread, and that it should be therein reserved over the Altar.

                        <p>But I have kept you too long within the Church, it is now time to go up to the top, and survey the outworks of it. It hath, as we have already said, at the front two Towers of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable beauty they are both of an equal height, and are each of them 377 steps in the ascent. From hence we could clearly see the whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54833:72"/>
neatly compacted. From hence could we see the whole valley round about it, such as I have also delineated already, though not in such lively colours as it meriteth.</p>
                        <p>In one of these Towers there is a ring of Bels, in the other two only, but these for worth are equall to all the rest; the bigger of the two is said to be greater then the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<q>Multorum manibus grande levatur onus,</q>
there are no lesse then four main ropes, besides their severall tale-ropes, to ring it. By reason of this trouble it is never rung, but in time of thunders, and those no mean ones nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, lesser bels will serve to disperse the lesser tempests; this is used only in the horrider claps, and such as threaten a dissolution of nature. But how well, as well this as the smaller bels discharge that office, experience would tell us were we void of reason; yet so much do the people affiance themselves to this conceit of the power of them, that they suppose it inherent to them continually, after the Bishop hath baptized them; which is done in this manner. The bell being so hanged that it may be washed within and without, in comes the Bishop in his Episcopall robes, attended by one of his Deacons, and sitting by the Bell in his chaire saith with a loud voice the 50, 53, 56, 66, 69, 85, and 12 <hi>Psalmes,</hi> or some of them: then doth he exorcize severally the salt and the water, and having conjured these ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents into an Holy-water, he washeth with it the Bell, both on the inside and the outside, wiping it dry with a linnen cloth, he readeth the 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, and 150 <hi>Psalms;</hi> he draweth a crosse on it with his right thumb dipped in hallowed oyl, (<hi>Chrisme</hi> they call it) and then prayeth over it. His prayer finished, he wipeth out that crosse, and having said over the 48 <hi>Psalm,</hi> he draweth on it with the same oyl, seven other crosses, saying, <hi>Sanctificetur &amp;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54833:73"/>
consecretur Domine campana ista, in nomine, &amp;c.</hi> After another prayer, the Bishop taketh the Censour, and putting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it Myrrhe and Frankincense, setteth it on fire, and putteth it under the Bell that it may receive all the fume of it. This done, the 76 <hi>Psalm</hi> read and some other prayers repeated, the Bell hath received his whole and entire B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

A strange piece of Religion that a Bell should be Baptized; and so much the stranger, in that these inanimate bodies can be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the Church, by no other ministry then that of the Bishop; the true Sacrament being permitted to every hedge Priest.</p>
                        <p>Not farre from the West gate of this Church of <hi>Nostre dame,</hi> is the <hi>Hostel dieu,</hi> or <hi>Le grand Hospital de Paris;</hi> first founded by St. <hi>Lewis, anno</hi> 1258. it hath been since beautifyed and enlarged, <hi>anno</hi> 1535. by Mr. <hi>Anthony Pratt</hi> Chancellour of <hi>France,</hi> who augmented the number of Hospitalers; and gave fair revenues for the maintaining of Chirurgeons, Apothecaries, and Religious men among them. Since that time, the <hi>Provosts</hi> and <hi>Eschevins</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> have been especiall Benefactors unto it. At the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into it, you come into their Chappell, small, but handsome and well furnished; after, you passe into a long gallery, having four ranks of beds, two close to the two wals, and two in the middle. The beds are all sutable one to the other; their Valence, Curtains and Rugs being all yellow. At the right hand of it, was a gallery more then double the length of this first, so also fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished. At the further end of this a door opened into another Chamber, dedicated only to sick women: and within them another room, wherein women with childe are lightned of their burden, and their children kept till seven years of age, at the charge of the Hospitall. At the middle of the first gallery towards the left hand,

were four other ranks of beds, little differing from the rest, but that their furniture was blew; and in them there was no place for any but such as were somewhat woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and belonged properly to the Chirurgeon.

The <hi>Advocates</hi> have no setled studies within the <hi>Palais,</hi> but at the Barre; but the <hi>Procureurs</hi> or <hi>Attorneys</hi> have their severall pews in the great Hall, which is without this <hi>Grande Chambre,</hi> in such manner as I have before described at <hi>Roven:</hi> a large building it is, fair and high roofed: not long since ruined by a casualty of fire, and not yet fully finished.

                        </p>
                        <p>At the left hand of this <hi>Grande Chambre,</hi> or <hi>Golden Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre</hi> as they call it; is a Throne or seat Royall, reserved for the King, when he shall please to come and see the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Justice amongst his people; at common times it is naked and plain, but when the King is expected, it is clothed with blew-purple Velvet, semied with <hi>flowers de lys;</hi> on each side of it are two formes or benches, where the <hi>Peers</hi>

of both habits, both Ecclesiasticall and Secular, use to fit and accompany the King. But this is little to the ease or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Subject, and as little availeable to try the integrity of the Judges; his presence being alwayes foreknown, and so accordingly they prepared. Far better then is it, in the <hi>Grande Signeur,</hi> where the <hi>Divano,</hi> or Councell of the <hi>Turkish</hi> affairs holden by the <hi>Bassas,</hi> is hard by his bed-chamber which looketh into it: the window which giveth him this entervenue is perpetually hidden with a curtain on the side of the partition, which is towards the <hi>Divano;</hi> so that the <hi>Bassas</hi> and other Judges cannot at any time assure themselves that the Emperor is not listning to their sentences: an action in which nothing is <hi>Turkish</hi> or <hi>Mahometan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The authority of this Court extendeth it self unto all causes within the jurisdiction of it, not being meerly ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall. It is a law unto it self, following no rule written in their sentences, but judging according to equity and conscience. In matters criminall of greater consequence, the processe is here immediately examined, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of it by the inferior Courts; as at the arraignment of the Duke of <hi>Biron:</hi> and divers times also in matters perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. But their power is most eminent in disposing the affaires of State, and of the Kingdome. For such preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives have the <hi>French</hi> Kings given hereunto, that they can neither denounce War, nor conclude Peace, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent (a formall one at the least) of this Chamber. An alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Lands of the Crown, is not any whit valid, unlesse confirmed by this Court: neither are his Edicts in force, till they are here verified: nor his Letters Patents for the creating of a Peer, till they are here allowed of. Most of these, I confesse, are little more then matters of form, the Kings power and pleasure being become boundlesse; yet sufficient to shew the body of authority which they once had, and the shadow of it, which they still keep; yet of late they have got into their disposing one priviledge belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing formerly to the <hi>Conventus ordinum,</hi> or the Assembly of three Estates, which is the conferring of the regency or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of their King during his minority.

As for the inside, it is far more gracefull, and would be pleasing at the entrance, were the Guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber reformed. Some <hi>Hugonot</hi> architect, which were not in love with the errours of Antiquity, might make a pretty room of it; a <hi>catholick</hi> Carpenter would never get credit by it: for whereas the provident thrift of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers intended it (for the house would else be too narrow for the Kings retinue) both for a room of safety and of pleasure, both for bill-men and dancers; and for that cause made up some six ranks of seats on each side; that sparingnesse in the more curious eyes of this time, is little Kinglike: Countrey wenches might with indifferent stomach abuse a good Galliard in it, or it might perhaps serve with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For as it is said of the <hi>Gymnosophists</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> that <hi>Una Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus &amp; mansioni sufficit &amp; sepulturae:</hi> so may we of this Prince, the same Chamber serveth for to lodge him, to feed him, and also to confer and discourse with his Nobility.

                        <p>Proceed we now to the two Galleries, whereof the first is that of the Queen Mother, as being beautified and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned exceedingly by <hi>Katharine de Medices,</hi> mother to <hi>Henry</hi> III. and <hi>Charles</hi> IX. It containeth the pictures of all the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and the most loved of their Queens, since the time of St. <hi>Lewis.</hi> They stand each King opposite to his Queen, she being that of his wives which either brought him most estate, or his successors. The tables are all of a just length, very fair, and according to my little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

with the Painter, of a most excellent workmanship, and which addeth much grace to it, they are in a manner a perfect History of the State and Court of <hi>France</hi> in their severall times. For under each of the Kings pictures, they have drawn the portraitures of most of those Lords whom valor and courage in the field enobled beyond their births. Under each of the Queens the lively shapes of the most prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Ladies, whose beautie and virtue had honored the Court. A dainty invention, and happily expressed. At the further end of it standeth the last King and the present Queen Mother; who fill up the whole room. The succeeding Princes, if they mean to live in their pictures, must either build new places for them, or else make use of the long Gallery built by <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and which openeth into that of the Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>een Mother. A Gallery it is of an incredible length, as being above 500 yards long, and of a breadth and height not unporportionable; a room built rather for ostentation then use, and such as hath more in it of the majesty of its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>ounder then the grace. It was said to have been erected purposely to joyn the <hi>Louure</hi> unto the House and Garden of the <hi>Tuilleries,</hi> an unlikely matter that such a stupendious building should be designed only for a cleanly conveyance into a Summer house: others are of an opinion that he had a res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Which design had it taken effect, this Palace would at once have been the wonder of the world, and the envy of it. For my part, I dare be of this last minde, as well because the second side is in part begun, as also considering how in finitely this King was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to building. The <hi>Place Daulphin,</hi> and the <hi>Place Royall,</hi> two of the finest piles in <hi>Paris,</hi> were erected partly by his purse, but principally by his encouragement. The new Bridge in <hi>Paris</hi> was meerly his work; so was also the new Palace, and most admirable waterworks of St. <hi>Germans en lay.</hi> This long Gallery and the new Pest house oweth it self wholly to him; and the house of <hi>Fountainebleau,</hi> which is the fairest in <hi>France,</hi> is beholding to him for most of its beauty; add to this his Fortifications bestowed on the <hi>Bastile;</hi>

his walling of <hi>Arles;</hi> and his purpose to have strengthned <hi>Parts</hi> according to the modern art of Towns: and you will finde the attribute of <hi>Parietaria</hi> or wall flower, which <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> scoffingly gave unto <hi>Trajan</hi> for his great humour of building, to be due unto this King; but seriously and with reverence.</p>
                        <p>Besides the generall love he had to building, he had also an ambition to go beyond example, which also induceth me fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to believe his intent of making that large and admirable quadrangle above spoken of, to have been serious and reall. For to omit others, certain it is, that he had a project of great spirit and difficulty, which was to joyn the <hi>Mediterranean sea</hi> and the <hi>Ocean</hi> together; and to make the Navigation from the one to the other through <hi>France,</hi> and not to passe by the straight of <hi>Gibraltare.</hi> It came into Councell, <hi>anno</hi> 1604, and was resolved to be done by this means: The river <hi>Garond</hi> is Navigable from the <hi>Ocean</hi> almost to <hi>Tholoza;</hi> and the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> openeth it self into the Land by a little River, whose name I know not, as high as <hi>Narbonne.</hi> Betwixt these two places was there a Navigable channell to have been digged, and it proceeded so far towards, being actuated, that a workman had undertaken it, and the price was agreed upon. But there arising some discontents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> about the building of the Fort <hi>Fluentes</hi> in the Countrey of the <hi>Grisons;</hi> the King not knowing what use he might have of Treasure in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, commanded the work not to go forward. However he is to be commended in the attempt, which was indeed Kinglike, and worthy his spirit: praise him in his heroick purpose and designe.</p>

                        <p>The same night, we came to <hi>Estampes,</hi> a Town situate in a very plentisul and fruitful soyl; and watred with a river of the same name, stored with the best crevices. It seemeth to have been a town of principall importance; there being five wals and gates in a length, one before another: so that it appeareth to be rather a continuation of many towns to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, then simply one. The streets are of a large breadth; the building for substance are stone; and for fashion as the rest of <hi>France.</hi> It containeth in it five Churches, whereof the principal, which is a Colledge of <hi>Chanoins,</hi> is that of <hi>Nostre dame;</hi> built by King <hi>Robert:</hi> who is said also to have foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Castle; which now can scarsely be visited in its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>. Without the town, they have a fine green medow, daintily seated within the circlings of the water; into which they use to follow their recreations. At my being there, the sport was dancing; an exercise much used by the <hi>French,</hi> who do naturally affect it. And it seemeth this natural inclination, is so strong and deep rooted; that neither age nor the absence of a smiling fortune can prevail against it. For on this dancing green, there assembled not only youth and Gentry, but age also and beggery. Old wives which could not put foot to ground without a Crutch, in the streets; had here taught their feet to hoble; you would have thought by the cleanly conveyance of their bodies that they had been troubled with the <hi>Sciatica:</hi> and yet so eager in the sport, as if their dancing daies should never be done. Some there were so ragged, that a swift Galliard would almost

have shaked them into nakedness: and they also most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to have their carkasses <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

To have attempted the staying of them at home, or the perswading of them to work, when they had heard the Fiddle, had been a task too unwieldy for <hi>Hercules.</hi> In this mixture of age and condition, did we observe them at their pastime; the rags being so interwoven with the silks, and wrinkled browes so interchangeably mingled with fresh beauties: that you would have thought it, to have been a mummery of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. As for those of both sexes, which were altogether past action; they had caused themselves to be carried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their chairs, and trod the measure with their eyes. The Inne which we lay in was just like those of <hi>Normandy;</hi> or at the least so like as was fit for sisters; for such you must think them.</p>

                        <p>All the difference between them lay in the morning: and amongst the maid-servants. For here we were not troubled with such an importunate begging as in that other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. These here had learned a more neat and compendious way of getting money; and petitioned not our ears, but our noses. By the rhetorick of a posie, they prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the purse; and by giving each of us a bundle of dead flowers tacked together, seemed rather to buy our boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then to beg them.

By that time we had cleared our selves of our pottage, there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon us three uncouth fellowes, with hats on their heads like covered dishes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As soon as ever I saw them, I cast one eye on my cloak, and the other on my sword: as not knowing what use I might have of my steel, to maintain my cloth. There was great talk at that time of Mr. <hi>Soubises</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in armes: and I much feared that these might be some straglers of his Army: and this I suspected by their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, which were very theevish and full of insolences. But when I had made a survey of their apparel, I quickly altered that opinion; and accounted them as the excrement of the next prison: deceived alike in both my jealousies; for these pretty parcels of mans flesh, were neither better nor worse, but even arrant fidlers: and such which in <hi>England</hi> we should not hold worthy of the whipping-post. Our leave not asked, and no reverence on their parts performed, they abused our ears with an harsh lesson: and as if that had not been punishment enough unto us, they must needs add to it one of their songs. By that little <hi>French</hi> which I had gathered, and the simpring of a <hi>fille de joy</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> who came along with us; I perceived it was bawdy; and to say the truth, more then could be patiently endured by any but a <hi>French</hi> man. But <hi>quid facerem,</hi> what should I do but endure the misery? for I had not language enough to call them Rogues handsomely; and the villains were inferiour to a beating: and indeed not worthy of mine or any honest mans anger.</p>

Of his revenue I could learn nothing, but of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge this: namely, that at the first entrance of every new Bishop into this Church, he hath the liberty of setting free any of the prisoners of the Gaole: though their crime be never so mortall. For, the original of this indulgence: we are beholding to St. <hi>Aignan,</hi> once Bishop here, and who defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the City against <hi>Attila</hi> the <hi>Hunne.</hi> At his first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance

                           </hi> the Governour, that for his sake he would let loose all his prisoners, <hi>ut omnes quos pro variis criminibus poenalis carcer detinebat inclusos, in sui introi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus gratiam redderet absolutos;</hi> when the Governour had heard his request, he denied it: and presently a stone falleth upon his head, no man knew from whence: wounded and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with this, the Governor granteth his desire, recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her health: and ever since the custome hath continued. For the truth of this story, I intend to be no Champion: for I hold it ridiculous and savouring too much of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend: but this I am certain of, that every new Bishop ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a very solemn and majestick entry into the City; and at his entry, releaseth a prisoner.</p>
                        <p>Let us follow the Bishop into his Church, and there we shall finde him entertained with an high Masse; the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies whereof are very pretty and absurd.

For as soon as the priest at the altar hath read a certain lesson, but what, his voice was not audible enough to tell me: out marcheth the Dean, or in his absence, the senior Canon, out of the Church. Before him two or three torches, and a long crosse silvered over, after him all those of the Church, and lastly the lay people, both men and women: so that there is none le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I have seen many a dumb shew in a play just like it. This only is the difference, that here we had no interpreter nor Chorus afforded us to shew us the mysterie of this silent gesticulation. The other addition which I observed here at the Masse (though I have since been told that it is ordinary at high Masses, in the Cathedral Churches) was the censing of the people: which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in this manner. Whilest the Priest was busie at the Altar, there entred into the quire at a side door, two boyes in
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54833:93"/>
their Surplices, bearing wax-tapers in their hands: and immediately after them the foresaid fellow with the Crosse, in the rere there came two of the Priests in their copes, and other stately vestiments: between both a young lad with the incense-pot, made full of holes to let out the sume; which he swingeth on all sides of him, with a chain, to which it was fastned: having thus marched through the Church and censed the people, he ascendeth unto the Altar, and there censeth the crosse, the relicks, the bread, the wine, the chalice, the images: and I know not what not. A custome very much used amongst the Heathen. <hi>Omnibus viris factae sunt statuae &amp; ad eas thus &amp; cerei,</hi> saith <hi>Tully:</hi> and, <hi>Jane tibi primum thura merum<expan>

I know they had rather seem to derive it from the 30 chap. and 7. vers. of <hi>Exodus:</hi> and so Bishop <hi>Durand</hi> is of opinion in his <hi>Rationale divinorum:</hi> but this will not help them. <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> there is commanded only to burn incense on the Altar: and not to cense men and images, crosses and relicks, &amp;c. as the Papists do. So that will they, nill they, they must be counted followers of the Heathen: though I envie them not the honour of being Jewes.</p>

more leasure to learn. That time which the other spent at high Masses, and at their Canonicall hours, these men bestowed upon their books: they being exempted from these duties by their order. Upon this ground they trouble not their heads with the crotchets of Musick, nor spend their moneths upon the chanting out of their services. They have other matters to imploy their brains upon, such as are the ruin of Kingdoms, and desolation of Countries. It was the saying of <hi>Themistocles,</hi> being requested to play a lesson on the Lute, <hi>That he could not fidle, but he could tell how to make a little Town a great City.</hi> The like we may say of the Jesuites; They are no great singers, but are well skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in making little Cities great, and great ones little. And certain it is, that they are so far from any ability or desire this way, that upon any of their solemn Festivals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when their Statutes require musick, they are faine to hire the singing men of the next <hi>Cathedrall.</hi> As here upon the feast of their Patron St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> being the 21 of <hi>July,</hi> they were compelled to make use of the voyces of the Church of St. <hi>Croix.</hi>

                        <p>To this advantage of leasure is added the exact method of their teaching, which is indeed so excellent, that the Protestants themselves in some places send their sons to their Schools; upon desire to have them prove exquisite in those arts they teach. To them resort the children of the rich as well as of the poor, and that in such abundance, that wheresoever they settle, other houses become in a manner desolate, or frequented only by those of the more heavie and phlegmatick constitutions. Into their Schooles when they have received them, they place them in that forum or Classis into w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they are best fitted to enter.

                        <p>This notwithstanding, they were at the first institution of them mightily opposed, and no where more violently then in the University of <hi>Paris.</hi> An University that stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth much upon its liberty and priviledges; to which this order was imagined to be an hindrance: it being lawfull for them to take any degree in their own houses, without reference to any publick exercise or examination. In the year 1554. at what time they first began to set foot in <hi>France,</hi> the Colledge of the <hi>Sorbonists</hi> made a long decree against them, in the end whereof are these words, and they are worth the reading, <hi>Uidetur haec societas in n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Upon the Universities deniall of their desire, there arose a suit between them and the University in the high Court of Parliament; <hi>Peter Versoris</hi> pleading for the Jesuits, and <hi>Stephen Pasquier</hi> for the other party.

They there teach them not Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall constructions or composition, but instruct them in the paths of virtue, courage and obedience, according to such examples as their Authors afford them.

                        <p>But it is not the fate of these Jesuits to have great persons only, and Universities only to oppose their fortunes: they have also the most accomplisht malice, that either the secular Priests or Fryers amongst whom they live, can fasten upon them.

Better accompaned we were then when we came from <hi>Orleans,</hi> for here we had Gentlemen of the choicest fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, very ingenious, and in my opinion of finer condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then any I had met withall in all my acquaintance with that Nation.

Thus associated we began to jog towards St. <hi>Loup,</hi> where that night we were to be lodged. The Countrey such as already I have described it in the Isle of <hi>France,</hi> save that beyond St. <hi>Denis</hi> it began to be somewhat more hilly. By the way I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served those little crossets erected in the memorie of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> as being vainly supposed to be his resting places, when he ran from <hi>Mont-martre</hi> with his head in his hand, which the zealous madnesse of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> had thrown down, and were now reedified by King <hi>Lewis.</hi> It could not but call to mind the hate of that Nation unto that harmelesse monument of Christs sufferings, the Crosse; which is grown it seemeth so exorbitant, that the Papists make use of it to discover an <hi>Hugonot.</hi> I remember as I passed by water from <hi>Amiens</hi> to <hi>Abbeville,</hi> we met in the boat with a levie of <hi>French</hi> Gentlewomen; to one of them, with that <hi>French</hi> as I had, I applyed my self, and she perceiving me to be <hi>English,</hi> questioned my Religion. I answered (as I safely might) that I was a <hi>Catholick:</hi> and she for her better sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction proffered me the little crosse which was on the top of her beads to kisse, (and rather should I desire to kisse it then many of their lips) whereupon the rest of the company gave of me this verdit, that I was <hi>Un urai Christien, &amp; ne point un Hugon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The same day we parted from <hi>Paris,</hi> we pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed through the Town of <hi>Luzarch,</hi> and came to that of St. <hi>Loup.</hi> The first famous only in its owner, which is the Count of <hi>Soissons.</hi> The second in an Abbey there situate built in memory of St. <hi>Lupus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Trios</hi> in <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne.</hi> These Townes passed, we were entred into <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="164" facs="tcp:54833:106"/>
                           <hi>Picardie</hi> is divided into the higher, which containeth the Countries of <hi>Calice</hi> and <hi>Boulogne,</hi> with the Town <hi>Monstrevill:</hi> and the lower, in which are the goodly Cities of <hi>Amiens, Abbeville,</hi> and many other places of principall note. The higher which is the lesser, and more Northern part is bounded North and West with the <hi>English</hi> Ocean; and on the East with <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Artoys.</hi> The lower, which is the larger, the richer and the more Southern, hath on the East the little Country of <hi>Veromandys;</hi> on the West <hi>Normandy;</hi> and on the South the Countrey of <hi>Champagne.</hi> In length it comprehendeth all the 51 degree of Latitude, and three parts of the 50; extending from <hi>Calice</hi> in the North, to <hi>Clermont</hi> in the South. In breadth it is of a great inequality. For the higher <hi>Picardie</hi> is like <hi>Linea</hi> amongst the <hi>Logitians,</hi> which they desine to be <hi>longitudo sine latitudine,</hi> it being indeed nothing in a manner, but a meer border. The lower is of a larger breadth, and containeth in it the whole 24 degree of longitude, and a fourth part of the 23; so that by the proportion of degrees, this Province is 105 miles long, and 25 broad.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the name of <hi>Picardie,</hi> it is a difficulty beyond my reading and my conjecture. All I can do is to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the lesse probable opinions of other writers, and make my self subject to that scoffe which <hi>Lactantius</hi> bestoweth on <hi>Aristotle, Rectè hic sustulit aliorum disciplinas, sed non recte fundavit suam.</hi> Some then derive it from <hi>Piquon,</hi> one forsooth of <hi>Alexander</hi> the greats Captains, whom they fain to have built <hi>Amiens</hi> and <hi>Piquigni;</hi> an absurdity not to be honoured with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation: some from the Town of <hi>Piquigni</hi> it self, of which mind is <hi>Mercator;</hi> but that Town never was of such note as to name a Province: others derive it from <hi>Picardus</hi> a fanaticall Heretick of these parts, about the year 1300 and after; but the appellation is far older then the man: others fetch it from the <hi>Picts</hi> of <hi>Britain,</hi> whom they would have to flie hither after the discomfiture of their Empire and Nation by the <hi>Scots;</hi> a transmigration of which all Histories are silent: this being the verdict of the best Antiquary ever was nursed up in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Picti itaque funesstissimo praelio debellati, aut penitus fuerunt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tincti, aut paulatim in Scotorum nomen &amp; nationem concesserint.</hi>

Lastly, some others derive the name from <hi>Pique,</hi> which signifieth a Lance or a Pike, the inventors of which warlike weapon, the fathers of this device would fain make them.

Add to this, that he had caused the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> being acknowledged the first Prince of the bloud, to be imprisoned in the <hi>Bastile,</hi> and had searched into the continuance of the lives of the King and his brother, by the help of Sorcery and Witchcraft. Besides, he was suspected to have had secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence with some forain Princes, ill willers to the State; and had disgraced some and neglected others of the Kings old confederates. Certainly these actions seem to import some project beyond a private and obedient greatnesse, though I can hardly believe that he durst be ambitious of the Crown; for being a fellow of a low birth, his heart could not but be too narrow for such an hope, and having no party amongst the Nobility, and being lesse gracious with the people, he was altogether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The Citadell of it, thought to be impregnable. Not permitted to be viewed. The overmuch opennesse of the <hi>English</hi> in discovering their strength.

                        </argument>
                        <p>THat night we went from <hi>Clermont</hi> to a Town called <hi>Brettaul,</hi> where we were harboured: being from <hi>Clermont 6 French</hi> leagues; and from <hi>Paris</hi> 20. Our entertainment there such as in other places: as sluttish, as inconvenient. The next day being the 29, about ten of the clock, we had a sight of the goodly City of <hi>Amiens.</hi> A City of some four <hi>English</hi> miles circuit within the wals, which is all the greatnesse of it: for without the wals it hath houses few or none. A City very capacious, and for that cause hath been many times honoured with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and trains of many great Princes: besides that once it entertained almost an whole Army of the <hi>English.</hi> For King <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11. having made an advantagious peace with our <hi>Edward</hi> 4. and perceiving how ungratefull it was amongst the military men, he intended also to give them some manner of satisfaction: He sent therefore unto them 300 carts loaden with the best Wines: and seeing how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable a present that had proved; he intended also to feast them in <hi>Amiens,</hi> within half a league of which their Camp was lodged. This entertainment lasted four daies,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54833:109"/>
each street having in it two long tables: and each table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing furnished with very plentiful provision. Neither were they denied entrance into any of the Taverns, and Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alling houses, or therein stinted either in meats, or drinks; whatsoever was called for, being defrayed by King <hi>Lewis.</hi> An action wherein, if mine opinion might carry it, there was little of the politician. For there were permitted to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Nine thousand are reckoned by <hi>Comines</hi> to have b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Those of the <hi>French</hi> Kings Counsell much scared it, and therefore enformed both Princes of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the one of his Town, the other of his Honour. But this jealousie was but a <hi>French</hi> distrust, and might well have been spared: the <hi>English</hi> being of that Generals minde, who scorned to steal a victory, and of that generous disposition, that they would not betray their credits. <hi>Nunquam illis adei ulla opportuna visa est victoriae occasio, quam damno pensarent fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des:</hi> as the Historian of <hi>Tib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                              </gap>rius.</hi> If this City then escaped a sack or a surprisal, it cannot be imputed to the wisdome of the <hi>French,</hi> but to the modesty and fair dealing of the <hi>English.</hi> But this was not the only soloecism in point of state, committed by that great politick of his time, King <hi>Lewis:</hi> there never being man so famed for his brain, that more grosly over-reached himself, then that Prince, though perhaps more frequently.</p>
                        <p>The buildings of this Town are of diverse materials, some built of stone, others of wood, and some again of both. The streets very sweet and clean, and the air not giving pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Of their buildings the principal are their Churches, whereof there are twelve on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in number: Churches I mean parochial, and besides those belonging to Religious houses. Next unto them the work of most especial note, is a great and large Hospital; in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and the disposing of the beds much like unto the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stel Dieu</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> but in number much inferiour; <hi>Et me

                              </gap>amen rapuerant,</hi> and yet the decency of them did much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light me. The sweetnesse and neatnesse of the Town, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded partly as I said from the air, and partly from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of the River of <hi>Some,</hi> on which it is seated. For the river running in one entire bank at the further end of the Town, is there divided into six channels, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most at an equall distance run through the several parts of it. Those channels thus divided, receive into them all the ordure and filth, with which the Town otherwise might be pester'd: and affordeth the people a plentifull measure of water wherewith to purge the lanes, and bie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of it, as often as them listeth. But this is not all the benefit of these Channels: they bestow upon the City mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter also of commodity, which is the infinite number of Grist-mils, that are built upon them. At the other end of the Town the Channels are again united into one stream: both those places, as well of the division, as of the union of the Channels being exceeding well fortified with chains and piles, and also with bulwarks and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works.</p>
                        <p>Neither is the Town well fortified and strengthned at those passages only: the other parts of it having enough of strength to inable them to a long resistance. The ditch round about it, save where it meeteth with the Citadell, is exceeding deep, and steepie: the wals of a good height, broad, and composed of earth and stone equally: the one making up the outside of them, and the other the inside. The Gates are very large and strong, as well in the sinewie composition of themselves, as in the addition of the Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, Suburbs this City hath none, because a Town of war: nor any liberal circuit of territory, because a frontier. Yet the people are indifferently wealthy, and have amongst them good trading; besides the benefit of the Garrison, and the Cathedral. The Garrison consisteth of 250 men, (500 in all they should be) who are continually in pay to guard the Citadel, their pay eight Sols daily. The Governor of them is the Duke of <hi>Chaune,</hi> who is also the Lieutenant or Deputy Governour of the whole Province under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable: their Captain Mr. <hi>Le Noyre,</hi> said to be a man of good
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54833:110"/>
experience, and worthy his place. This Citadel was built by <hi>Henry</hi> 4. as soon as he had recovered the Town from the <hi>

It is seated on the lower part of the City, though somewhat on the advantage of an hill, and seemeth in mine opinion, better situate to command the Town, then to defend it; or rather to recover the Town being taken, then to save it from taking. They who have seen it, and know the arts of fortification, report it to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p>Nor am I able to contradict it. For besides that it is a skill beyond my profession, we were not permitted to come within it, or to take a survey of it, but at a distance. As soon as we approached nigh unto it, one of the Garrison proffer'd us the Musket: a sufficient warning not to be too venturous. So that all which I could observe was this: that they had within themselves good plenty of earth to make their Gabions, and repair their breaches. With the same jealousie also, are the rest of the Forts and Towns of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance guarded in this and other Countreys: no people that ever I heard being so open in shewing their places of strength and safety unto strangers, as the <hi>English.</hi> For a dozen of Ale a foreiner may pace over the curtain of <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> and measure every stone and bulwark of it.

or what <hi>Suetonius</hi> spake of <hi>Titus,</hi> when he called him <hi>Delitias humani generis;</hi> both those attributes and more too, may I most fitly fasten on this most magnificent Structure. The whole body of it is of most curious and polisht stone, every where born up by buttresses of that excellent composure, that they seem to add more of beauty to it then of strength. The Quire of it, as in great Churches commonly it is, is of a fairer fabrick then the body, thick set with dainty pillars, and most of them reaching to the top of it, in the fashion of an arch. I am not well able to judge, whether this Quire, or the Chappell of King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. at <hi>Westminster,</hi> be the more exquisite piece of Architecture; though I am not ignorant that <hi>Leland</hi> calleth that of our King <hi>Miraculum orbis.</hi> I perswade my self, that a most discerning eye could find out but little difference between them, and that difference more subtile then sound: for if such perfection may receive the word of <hi>more,</hi> it might be said, that there were more majesty in this of <hi>Amiens,</hi> and more of lovelinesse in that of <hi>Westminster;</hi> yet so that the ones majesty did exceed in lovelinesse, and the others lovelinesse exceed in majesty.</p>

As soon as entred you will suppose that the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of it are all of gold; such a lustre doth it cast upon the eyes of all those that look upon it. The glory of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, next unto the description of it in the Scriptures, is best read in this Church, of which it seemeth to have been the pattern. <hi>Jupiters</hi> house in heaven described by the Poets, was never half so gorgeous as this on the earth; that therefore which <hi>Ovid</hi> Poetically spake concerning that imaginary Palace of the false God, we may positively verifie of this reall mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the true God.</p>

                        <p>To instance in particulars; the partition between the Quire and the body, is so overlaid with gold, that the acutest sight could apprehend no other substance of it; and yet the art of the workman so fully expressed its power on it, that the cost was much inferiour to the workmanship; so curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously was it adorned with excellent Imagery, and what else the hand of man could fashion into portraiture: on the top of it was the Statua of our Lady in the just height and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of a woman, all either of gold or gilded; her child in her armes, of the same making. She was there expressed as standing in a round circle, unto every point of which she darted out rayes and beams of gold; just as the Sun doth seem to do, when the Painter hath drawn him in his full lustre. The glasse of the Church generally, and particularly that about the Quire, and the Virgins Chappell, is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest of life and beauty, of any that I ever yet set eye upon. As much as that of St. <hi>Denis</hi> exceedeth ours at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> so much doth this St. <hi>Denis.</hi> But the largest measure of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in it is that of the Pillars, which though full of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54833:113"/>
majesty in their height and compasse, have yet an ornament added to them more majesticall then the majesty, for upon each of them (there are four ranks of them in all) are fastned four Tables, which take up their whole circle, every Table being in length two yards or thereabout. In every of these, are the pictures of sundry men and women of the better qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, so exactly limmed, that neither a curious eye could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, nor a cunning hand discharge it better. These Tables are the Monuments and Tombs of the Burgers of the City, or of the noblest of the Countrey nigh unto it; who in them have caused their pictures to be drawn with as great art and state as cost could procure them, and in a subscription of golden letters, have eternized their names and that act to all succeeding posterity. So that we may justlysay of the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuousnesse of this Church, what the Historian doth of the Temple of <hi>Delphos, Multa igitur ibi, &amp; opulenta regum populorumque visuntur munera; quaeque magnificentia sui, reddentium vota gratam voluntatem manifestant.</hi> Neitheir have these Sepulchrall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments been of any great standing; the antientest of them which I could observe having been erected since the year 1570. Add to these the curious works which the ingraver hath cut in the main wals, and then you perhaps will fall into the same extasie that I did, and pick a quarell with nature and the heavens, that they had not made you all into an eye.</p>
                        <p>In this Church, as in others also of this party, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the high Altar in the middest of the Quire, there are divers others in the private Clossets, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Of these there are in number 24. all of them seated between the two outermost rankes of pillars and the wals; prety neat places, and it is pity they should be abused to such Idolatries. Of three of them I took especiall notice, they being indeed the chiefest of the rest, either for furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or use.</p>
                        <p>The first of them was that of the Virgin, which was divided from the rest of the Church by a sphere made of wood, which reached unto the tops of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54833:114"/>
On the outside the Planets, Starres and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations were most artificially set down in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per orbes, with the times of absolving their severall courses. On the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>de, those spaces were filled up with a pack of Verses in commendation of our Lady. The Altar there, was for matter and making, the most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that ever I yet looked upon; that on the other side in the Quire, and over which is the image of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, being more despicable then were fit for the credite of a Village. Over this Altar was the Virgins Statua, all gilt, and of a full and womanly proportion; two Angels of the same materials attending on her. Finally, this Chappell considering the richnesse and glory of it, may be styled the <hi>Epitome of the Church;</hi> that attribute of <hi>Immensae opulentiae Templum,</hi> being no more deservedly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyable to <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, of which <hi>Tacitus</hi> spake it, then to this.</p>
                        <p>The second of them, stood as I remember, at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It was separated from the rest of the Church by two ranks of brasse pillars, one rank above the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The pillars all curiously casted, and such as would not shame the workman. In this Massing Closet over the Altar there was hanged a tablet, which by the many lines and shadowes drawn in it, seemed to represent some piece of building. Moving my hand towards mine eye in the nature and kind of a Perspective glasse, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it to be the representation of that Church in which I stood to see it; and it was done with that cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that it would almost have perswaded a man out of himself, and made him believe, that he had been in the Church yard. So perfectly did it shew the majesty of the Front, the beauty of the Iles, the number of the Pillars, and the glory of the Quire. A kinde of work, in mine opinion of all others the most excellent, and such as would infinitely delight an optick. Had not

Being thus routed, they fled to this Town, into which their enemies followed with them, intending to put them all to the sword: but at last their fury being allaied, they proposed that mercy to them, which those of <hi>Gilead</hi> did unto those of <hi>Ephraim</hi> in the Scriptures: life and liberty being promised to all them which could pronounce this word <hi>Piquigni.</hi> It seemeth it was not in those dayes a word possible for an <hi>English</hi> mouth; for the <hi>English</hi> saying all of them <hi>Pequenie</hi> in stead of <hi>Piquigni,</hi> were all of them put to the sword: thus far the Tradition.

                        <p>The next place of note that the water conveied us to, was the Town and Castle of <hi>Pont d' Arme:</hi> a place now scarce visible in the ruines, and belonging to one Mr. <hi>Quercy.</hi> It took name, as they say, from a bridge here built for the transportation of an Army; but this I cannot justifie. Three leagues down the river is the Town of <hi>Abbeville;</hi> a Town conveniently seated on the <hi>Some,</hi> which runneth through it. It is of greater circuite within the wals, then the City of <hi>Amiens,</hi> and hath four Parish Churches more then it; but is not so beautifull, nor so populous. For the houses here are of an older stampe, and there is within the Town no scarcity of wast ground. I went round about the wals, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the thinness of the houses, &amp; the largeness of the fields, which are of that capacity and extent, that for ought I could apprehend, the Town need never fear to be compelled by famine, if those fields were husbanded to the best advantages. The wals are of earth within and stone without, of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall breadth, and in some places ruinous. A Castle it once had, of which there is now scarce any thing remaining. In stead of which, and in places more convenient, they built out
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54833:117"/>
three Bastions, very large and capacious; and such well man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned need not yeeld upon a summons. There are also a couple of mounts raised nigh unto the wall, at that place where the Countrey is most plain, upon which good O<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>dinance would have good command; but at this time there were none upon it. Without the wals it is diversly strengthned, having in some places a deep ditch without water, in some a shallower ditch but well filled by the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the river, in others only a moorish and fennie levell, more dangerous to the enemie, and secure to the Town, then either of the rest, and therefore never guarded by the Souldiers of the Garrison. But the chief strength of it, is five Companies of <hi>Swiss,</hi> 100 in a company, proper tall fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in appearance, and such as one would imagine fit for the service. It was my chance to see them begin their watch; to which imployment they advanced with so good order, and such a shew of stomach, as if they had not gone to gua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>And yet before I leave this Town, I must needs take notice of an Adventure which might have proved prjudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to me, if my good fortune had not overcome all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary accidents. My companions had no sooner landed out of the boat which brought us from <hi>Amiens,</hi> but presently
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54833:118"/>
they betook themselves to the Post-house without the Town, that they might be ready for <hi>Bologne</hi> the next morning. But I who did not think that I was to make such a gollopping journey thorow <hi>France,</hi> as the foolish traveller affirmed he had made thorow <hi>Venice,</hi> resolved to satisfie my self in all those particulars which I found capable of note and observation. Which having done, and thinking I had still day enough for my curiosities, I betook my self to the <hi>Corps du guard,</hi> where being soon known to be a Gentleman of <hi>England,</hi> I easily obtained leave to walk round about the works of the Town, and to observe the situation, strength, and defences of it. But so it hapned that before I came to the gate which led towards the Post-house, I found it newly locked up by the Captain of the watch for that night, and thought I might have found passage at the next gate, had I hastned towards it; yet I was so taken up with the orderly march of the Guards, being all proper fellowes and well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that before I came to that gate, it was locked up also: which being the two only gates on that side of the River, deprived me of all ordinary means to come that night to my Companions, who were resolved to be on horse back the next morning by the break of day. I had now liberty enough to traverse and consult the streets, within which I seemed to be imprisoned, but could meet none that could informe me how to free my self out of that restraint; at last I met with an old Burger of a comely presence, who I thought promised better satisfaction then the rest had given me; who being acquainted with my desire of uniting my self with my companions, and the difficulty which my curiosity had brought upon me, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected me to the house of the Provost, who, as he told me, had the keeping of a Water gate under one of the Arches of the wall by which the River passed thorow the Town, by which I might finde a way out of it, if I could wooe him to make use of his priviledge in that point, which he thought hard, if not impossible to be effected. Well, to the Provosts house I went, whom I found at home, acqua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To this request he yeelded with a great deal of chearfulnesse, assuring me that he thought himself exceeding happy in having opportunity of doing any acceptable service to an <hi>English</hi> Gentleman: which said, he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

We had scarce ended this refreshment, when the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

immediately of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who is, no question, a very gracious Landladie. For when King <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. after the decease of <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> had taken in <hi>Boulogne, anno</hi> 1477. as new Lord of the Town (thus <hi>John de Serres</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it) he did homage without Sword or Spurs, bare-headed and on his knee, before the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> offering unto her Image an heart of massie gold, weighing 2000 crowns. He added also this, that he and his successors Kings after him, should hold the County of <hi>Boulogne</hi> of the said Virgin, and do homage unto her image in the great Church of the higher Town dedicated to her name, paying at every change of a Vassall an heart of pure gold of the same weight. Since that time, the <hi>Boulonnois</hi> being the Tenants of our Lady, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed a perpetuall exemption from many of those Tributes and Taxes, under which the rest of <hi>France</hi> is miserably afflicted. Amongst others they have been alwayes freed from the Gabell of Salt; by reason whereof, and by the goodnesse of their Pastures, they have there the best butter in all the Kingdome. I said partly by reason of their salt, because having it at a low rate, they do liberally season all their Butter with it; whereas they which buy their Salt at the Kings price, cannot afford it any of that deer commodity: upon this ground it is the custome of these of <hi>Boulonnois</hi> to send unto their friends of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> a barrell of Butter seasoned according to their fashion; a present no lesse ordinary and acceptable, then Turkies, Capons, and the like, are from our Countrey Gentlemen to those of <hi>London.</hi>

In the first front there was carried the Crosse, and after that the holy or sanctified Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; next unto it followed all the Priests of the Town bare-headed, and in their Surplices, singing as they went the Services destinate to that occasion. After them followed the men, and next to them the women of the Town, by two and two, it being so ordered by the <hi>Roman Rituall, Ut laici a clericis, foeminae a viris prosequantur se paratae.</hi> On the other side of the street went the Brethren <hi>De la Charitè,</hi> every one of them holding in his hand a little triangular Banner, or a Pennon; after them the boyes and wenches. In this method did they measure solemnly every lane and angle of the Town; the Priests singing, and all the people answering them in the same note. At the Church they began it with prayers, and having visited all the Town, they returned again thither to end it with the same devotion. An action very grave and solemn, and such as I could well allow of, were it not only for one prayer which is alwayes said at the time of this performance, and the addition of the Banners. The Prayer is this: <hi>Exaudi nos Deus salutaris noster, &amp; intercedente beata &amp; gloriosa Viigine, &amp; beato Sebasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano Martyre tuo</hi> (this <hi>Sebastian</hi> is their <hi>Aesculapius</hi> or tutelary Saint against the Sicknesse) <hi>&amp; omnibus Sanctis; populum tuum ab iracundiae tuae terroribus libera, &amp; misericordiae tuae fac largi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate securum, Amen.</hi> This only excepted, there is nothing in all the liturgie of it, which can be offensive to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, not idlely scrupulous.—These Processions

Yet hath their prerogative not always held to them; of 33 of them in <hi>Calice,</hi> three only surviving the disease, about four yeers since.

                           </gap>r certain it is, that here were divers pangs in the womb of the <hi>French</hi> Church before it was delivered. And first she was delivered of <hi>Esau,</hi> the <hi>Popish</hi> faith being first after the strugling coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by authority; <hi>And he came out red all over like an hairy garment,</hi> saith the text, which very appositely expresseth the bloudy and rough condition of the <hi>French</hi> Papists at the birth of the Reformation, before experience and long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance had bred a liking between them. <hi>And after came his Brother out, which laid hold on Esaus heel, and his name was called Jacob;</hi> wherein is described the quality of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant party, which though confirmed by publick Edict af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the other, yet hath it divers times endevoured, and will perhaps one day effect, the tripping up of the others heels <hi>And Esau</hi> (saith <hi>Moses) was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob a plain man, dwelling in tents:</hi> in which words the comparison is made exact. <hi>A cunning hunter,</hi> in the Scripture signifieth, <hi>a man of art and power mingled;</hi> as when <hi>

                           </hi> in <hi>Genesis</hi> 10. is termed <hi>a mighty hunter.</hi> Such is the Papist, a side of greater strength and subtility, a side of war and of the field; on the other side the Protestants are a plain race of men, simple in their actions, without craft and fraudulent behaviours, and dwelling in tents, that is, having no certain abiding place, no Province which they can call theirs; but living dispersed and scattered over the Countrey; which in the phrase of the Scripture is <hi>dwelling in tents.</hi> As for the other words differencing the two brethren, <hi>and the elder shall serve the younger,</hi> they are rather to be accounted a Prophesie then a Character; we must therefore leave the analogie it holds with this <hi>Rebecca</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and her two children, to the event and to prayer.</p>
                        <p>For a more particular insight into the strength and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of this <hi>Esau,</hi> we must consider it in the three main par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular strengths of it; its Polity, Priviledges and Revenue.

to have a <hi>prohibition</hi> from the Parliaments. Of their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the chiefest of the Clergy men is, the little or no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon the Pope, and the little profits they pay unto their King; of the Pope anon; to the King they pay only their Dismes, or Tithes according to the old ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In the generall assembly of the three Estates the Clergy hath authority to elect a set number of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, to undertake for them and the Church; which Commissioners do make up the first of the three Estates, and do first exhibit their grievances and Petitions to the King. In a word, the <hi>French</hi> Church is the freest of any in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, that have not yet quitted their subjection to the Pope, as alwayes protesting against the Inquisitions, not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting themselves to the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and paying very little to his Holinesse, of the plentifull revenue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God and good men have blessed it.</p>
                        <p>The number of those which the Church Land maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in <hi>France</hi> is <hi>tantum non</hi> infinite, therefore the Intrado and Revenue of it must needs be uncountable. There are numbred in it, as we said before, 12 Archbishops, 104 Bishopricks; to these add 540 Archpriories, 1450 Abbies, 12320 Priories, 567 Nunneries, 700 Covents of Fryers, 259 Commendames of the order of <hi>Malta,</hi> and 130000 Parish Priests. Yet this is not all, this reckoning was made in the year 1598. Since which time the Jesuits have divers Colledges founded for them, and they are known to be none of the poorest. To maintain this large wilde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>nesse of men, the Statistes of <hi>France,</hi> who have proportioned the Countrey; do allow unto the Clergy almost a fourth part of the whole. For supposing <hi>France</hi> to contain 200 milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Arpens (a measure somewhat bigger then our Acre) they have allotted to the Church for its temporall revenue, 47 of them. In particular of the Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots and Parish Priests, they of <hi>Aux, Alby, Cluniac</hi> and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54833:134"/>
St. <hi>Estiennes</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> are said to be the wealthyest; the Archbishoprick of <hi>Aux</hi> in <hi>Gascoine</hi> is valued at 400000 Livres or 40000 <hi>l. English</hi> yearly. The Bishop of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                                 <desc>•…</desc>
                              </gap>y</hi> in <hi>Lanquedoc,</hi> is prized at 10000 Florens, which is a fourth part of it; a great part of this revenue rising out of Saffron. The Abbot of <hi>Cluniac</hi> in the Dutchie of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> is said to be worth 50000 Crowns yearly; the present Abbot being <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lorreine,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Rheimes,</hi> and Abbot of St. <hi>Dennis.</hi> The Parish Priest of St. <hi>Estiennes,</hi> is judged to receive yearly no fewer then 8000 Crowns, a good Intrado. As for the vulgar Clergy they have little Tithe and lesse Glebe, most part of the revenue being appropriated unto <hi>Abbeys</hi> and other Religious houses; the greatest part of their means is the <hi>Baisse-maine,</hi> which is the Church-offerings of the people at Christnings, Marriages, Burials, Dirges, Indulgences, and the like; which is thought to amount to almost as much as the temporall estate of the Church, an income able to maintain them in good abundance, were it not for the greatnesse of their number; for reckoning that there are (as we have said) in <hi>France</hi> 130000 Parish Priests, and that there are only 27400 Parishes; it must of necessity be, that every Parishone with another must have more then four Priests; too many to be rich.</p>
                        <p>But this were one of the least injuries offered to the <hi>French</hi> thrift, and would little hinder them from rising, if it were not that the goodliest of their preferments were before their faces given unto boyes and children. An affront which not only despoileth them of the honors due unto their calling, but disheartneth them in their studies and by consequence draweth them unto debauched and slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous courses.</p>

                        <p>The Clergy therefore <hi>anno</hi> 1617. being assembled at the house of <hi>Austin Fryers</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi> (as every two years they use to do) being to take their leaves of the King, elected the Bishop of <hi>Aire</hi> to be their spokesman; and to certifie his
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54833:134"/>
Majesty of their grievances. In performing which businesse, the principall thing of which he spake was to this purpose; That whereas his Majesty was bound to give them fathers, he gave them children; that the name of Abbot signifieth a Father; and the function of a Bishop is full of fatherly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: that <hi>France</hi> notwithstanding was now filled with Bishops and Abbots, which are yet in their Nurses armes, or else under their Regents in Colledges; nay more, that the abuse goeth before their being; Children being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly designed to Bishopricks and Abbacies, before they were born. He made also another complaint, that the Soveraign Courts by their decrees, had attempted upon the authority which was committed to the Clergy, even in that which meerly concerned Ecclesiasticall discipline and government of the Church. To these complaints he gave them, indeed, a very gracious hearing, but it was no further then an hearing, being never followed by redresse. The Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment knew too well the strength of their own authority, and the King was loath to take from himself those excellent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of binding to himself his Nobility, by the speedy preferring of their children; and so the clergie departed with a great deal of envy, and a little satisfaction. Like enough it were, that the Pope would in part redresse this injury, especially in the point of jurisdiction, if he were able. But his wings are shrewdly clipped in this C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For his temporall power they never could be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to acknowledge it, as we see in their stories, <hi>anno</hi> 1610. the Divines of <hi>Paris</hi> in a Declaration of thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>On the other side, the common Priests of <hi>France,</hi> are so dull and blockish, that you shal hardly meet with a more contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible people. The meanest of our Curates in <hi>England,</hi> for spirit and discourse, are very Popes to them; for learning they may safely say with <hi>Socrates, Hoc tantum scimus quod ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scimus;</hi> but you must not look they should say it in Latine. Tongues they have none but that of their Mother and the Masse book: of which last they can make no use except the book be open, and then also the book is fain to read it self. For in the last <hi>Romanum Missale,</hi> established by <hi>Pius</hi> V. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized by <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. <hi>anno</hi> 1600. every syllable is divers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marked, whether it be sounded long or short; just as the versifying examples are in the end of the Grammar. When I had lost my self in the streets of <hi>Paris,</hi> and wanted <hi>French</hi> to enquire homeward, I used to apply my self to some of these reverend habit. But <hi>O seculum insipiens &amp; infacetum!</hi> you might as easily have wrung water out of the flint, as a word of Latine out of their mouths. Nor is this the disease of the vulgar Masse mumbler only, it hath also infected the right Worshipfull of the Clergy. In <hi>Orleans</hi> I had businesse with a Chanoin of the Church of St. <hi>Croix,</hi> a fellow that wore his Surplice (it was made of Lawn and lace) with as good a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, as ever I saw any, and for the comlinesse and capacity of his Cap, he might have been a Metropolitan: perceiving me to speak to him in a strange tongue, for it was Latine, he very readily asked me this question, <hi>Num potestis loqui Gallia?</hi> which when I had denyed, at last he broke out into another interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, <hi>viz. Quam diu fuistis in Gallice?</hi> To conclude, having
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54833:138"/>
read over my Letter, with two or three deadly pangs, and six times rubbing of his temples, he dismissed me with this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall, and truly it was very comfortable to my humour, <hi>Ego negotias vestras curabo.</hi> A strange beast, and one of the greatest prodigies of ignorance, that I ever met with in mans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell.</p>
                        <p>Such being the <hi>Romish</hi> Priests, it is no marvel that the <hi>French</hi> Papist be no more setled and resolute in their Religion. If the eye be blinde, the body cannot choose but be darkned. And certainly there is nothing that hath prepared many of this Realm more to imbrace the Reformation, then the blockish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their own Clergy. An excellent advantage to the Protestant Ministers, could they but well humor it, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be a fair enlargement to their party, if well husbanded. Besides this, the <hi>French Catholicks</hi> are not over earnest in the cause, and so lie open to the assaults of any politick enemy. To deal with them by main force of argument, and in the servent spirit of zeal, as the Protestants too often do, is not the way; men uncapable of opposition, as this people gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are, and furious if once thwarted; must be tamed as <hi>Alexander</hi> did his horse <hi>Bucephalus;</hi> those which came to back him with the tyranny of the spur and cudgell, he quickly threw down and mischiefed. <hi>Alexander</hi> came otherwise pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, for turning the horse towards the sun that he might not see the impatience of his own shadow, he spake kindly to him, and gently clapped him on the back, till he had left his flinging and wildnesse, he lightly leapt into the saddle, the horse never making resistance: <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his life relateth the story, and this is the morall of it.</p>

                        <p>WE have seen the strength and subtility, as also somewhat of his poverties at home: Let us now see the alliance which this <hi>French Esau</hi> hath abroad in the world; in what credit and opinion he standeth in the eye of <hi>Beeri</hi> the <hi>Romish Hittite,</hi> the daughter of whose abominations he hath marryed. And here I find him to hold good correspondency, as being the eldest son of the Church, and an equall poise to ballance the affaires of <hi>Italy</hi>

against the Potency of <hi>Spain</hi> On this ground the present Pope hath alwayes shewn himself very favourable to the <hi>French</hi> side, well knowing into what perils an unnecessary and impolitick dependance on the <hi>Spanish</hi> party only; would one day bring the State Ecclesiastick. As in the generall, so also in many particulars hath he expressed much affection unto him. As</p>

                        <p>To speak by conjectures, I am of opinion, that his Genius prompted him to see the speedy consummation of this marriage, of which his Papacy was so large an Omen, so far a prognostick.

The <hi>Lar</hi> or angell guardian of his thoughts hastned him in it; in whose time there was so plausible a Presage, that it must be accomplished. For thus it standeth: <hi>Malachi</hi> now a Saint, then one of the first Apostles of the <hi>Irish,</hi> one much reverenced in his memory unto this day by that Nation; left behind him by way of Prophesie a certain number of Mottoes in Latine, telling those that there should follow that certain number of Popes only, whose conditions suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively should be lively expressed in those Mottos, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that order which he had placed them. <hi>Messingham</hi> an <hi>Irish</hi> Priest, and Master of the Colledge of <hi>Irish</hi> fugitives in <hi>Paris,</hi> collected together the lives of all the <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The Papists hated the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants to see them thrive and increase so much amongst them.

And indeed, the present estate of the Protestants is not much better then that of <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> nor much different.

The ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulary power given unto this Chamber, is to cut off all those of the Kings grants which have no good ground and foundation; the officers being solemnly (at the least formally) sworn, not to suffer any thing to passe them, to the detriment of the Kingdome, whatsoever Letters of command thay have to the contrary. But this Oath they oftentimes dispense with. To this Court also belongeth the <hi>Enfranchisement</hi> or <hi>Naturalization of Aliens,</hi> anciently certain Lords, officers of the Crown, and of the prime counsell were appointed to look unto the accounts.

The Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> which speaketh, as it is prompted by power and greatnesse, appointeth the Regent; the Kings themselves with their officers determine of the Taxes; and as concerning their Grievances, the Kings eare is open to private Petitions.</p>
                        <p>Thus is that little of a Common-wealth which went to the making up of this Monarchie, escheated, or rather devoured by the King, that name alone containing in it both Clergy, Princes and People.

And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this is the issue of it, the former liveth the life of a slave to maintain his Lord in pride and lazinesse; the Lord liveth the life of a King to oppresse his Tenant by fines and exactions.

You shall meet with them so thick in the Kings Court especially, that you would think it almost impossible the Countrey should bear any other fruit. This, I think, I may safely affirme, and without Hyperbole, that they have there as many Princes, as we in <hi>England</hi> have Dukes; as many Dukes, as we Earls; as many Earls, as we Barons; and as many Barons as we have Knights; a jolly company, and such as know their own strength too. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore but much marvell, that these Kings should be so prodigall in conferring honours; considering this, that every Noble man he createth, is so great a weakning to his power.</p>
                        <p>On the other side, I cannot but as much wonder at some of our Nation, who have murmured against our late Soveraign, and accused him of an unpardonable unthriftiness, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing the dignities of his Realm, with so full and liberall a hand. Certainly, could there any danger have arisen by it unto the State, I could have been as impatient of it as another. But with us, titles and ennoblings in this kind, are only either the Kings favour, or the parties merit, and maketh whomsoever he be that receiveth them, rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced then powerfull. <hi>Raro eorum honoribus invidetur, quorum vis non timetur,</hi> was a good Aphorisme in the dayes of <hi>Paterculus;</hi> and may for ought I know be as good still. Why should I envie any man that honour, which taketh not from my safety; or repine at my Soveraign for raising any of his Servants into an higher degree of eminency, when that favour cannot make them exorbitant?

Were the people once warmed with the feeling of case and their own riches, they would presently be hearkning after the warres; and if no imployment were proffered abroad, they would make some at home. Histories and experience hath taught us enough of their humour in this kind; it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for this hot-headed, and hare-brained people, not to be doing. <hi>Si extraneus deest, domi hostem quaerunt,</hi> as <hi>Justin</hi> hath observed of the Ancient <hi>Spaniards;</hi> a prety quality, and for which they have often smarted.</p>

The bread then which they eat, is of the courseft flowre, and so black, that it cannot admit the name of brown. And as for their drink, they have recourse to the next Fountain.

In this, questionlesse, they are intirely mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, in that they are sensible of the wretchednesse of their present fortunes, and dare not labour nor expect an alteration. If industry and a sparing hand hath raised any of this afflicted people so high, that he is but 40 <hi>s.</hi> or 5 <hi>l.</hi> richer then his neighbour, his Lord immediately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunceth his Rents, and enformeth the Kings task-masters of his riches, by which means he is within two or three years brought again to equall poverty with the rest. A strange course, and much different from that of <hi>England,</hi> where the Gentry take a delight in having their Tenants thrive under them, and hold it no crime in any that hold of them to be wealthy. On the other side, those of <hi>France</hi> can abide no body to gain or grow rich upon their farmes; and therefore thus upon occasions rack their poor Tenants.

                        <p>To go over all those impositions, which this miserable people are afflicted withal, were almost as wretched as the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them; I will therefore speak only of the principall. And here I meet in the first place, with the Gabell or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position on Salt. This <hi>Gabelle de sel,</hi> this Impost on Salt was first begun by <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Long,</hi> who took for it a double (which is half a Sol) upon the pound. After whom <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Valoys, anno</hi> 1328. doubled that. <hi>Charles</hi> the VII. raised it unto three doubles; and <hi>Lewis</hi> the XI. unto fix. Since that time it hath been altered from so much upon the pound to a certain rate on the Mine, which containeth some 30 bushels <hi>English;</hi> the rates rising and falling at the Kings pleasure. This one commodity were ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>y advantagious to the Exchequer, were it all in the Kings hands; but at this time a great part of it is morgaged. It is thought to be worth unto the King three millions of Crowns yearly; that only of <hi>Paris</hi> and the Provosts seven Daughters, being farmed at 1700000 Crowns the year. The late Kings since <hi>anno</hi> 1581. being intangled in wars, have been constrained to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:54833:156"/>
let it out to others; in so much that about <hi>anno</hi> 1599. the King lost above 800000 Crowns yearly: and no longer agone then <hi>anno</hi> 1621. the King taking up 600000 pounds, of the Provost of Merchands and the Eschevines, gave unto them a rent charge of 40000 <hi>l.</hi> yearly, to be issuing out of his Customes of Salt, till their money were repaid them. This Gabell is, indeed, a Monopoly, and that one of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justest and unreasonablest in the World. For no man in the Kingdom (those Countries hereafter mentioned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) can eat any Salt, but he must buy of the King and at his price, which is most unconscionable; that being sold at <hi>Paris</hi> and elsewhere for five Livres, which in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted places is sold for one. Therefore that the Kings profits might not be diminished, there is diligent watch and ward, that no forain Salt be brought into the Land, upon pain of forfeiture and imprisoment. A search which is made so strictly, that we had much ado at <hi>Dieppe</hi> to be pardoned the searching of our trunks and port-mantles, and that not, but upon solemn protestation, that we had none of that commodity. This Salt is of a brown colour, being only such as we in <hi>England</hi> call Bay-salt; and imposed on the Subjects by the Kings Officers with great rigour, for though they have some of their last provision in the house, or perchance would be content (through poverty) to eat meat without it, yet will these cruell villaines enforce them to take such a quantity of them; or howsoever they will have of them so much money.</p>
                        <p>But this Tyranny is not generall, the <hi>Normans</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cards</hi> enduring most of it, and the other Paisant the rest. Much like unto which was the Licence which the Popes and B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For when such as had the charge of gathering the Popes Rents happened upon a Priest which had no Concubine, and for that cause made deniall of the Tributes; the Collectours would return them this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that notwithstanding this, they should pay the money, because they might have the keeping of a wench if they would.</p>

Antiently the Tailles were only levyed by way of extraordinary Subsidie, and that but upon four occasions, which were, the Knighting of the King Son, the marriage of his Daughters, a Voyage of the Kings beyond sea, and his Ransome in case he were taken Prisoner; <hi>Les Tailles ne sont point devis de voir or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaire</hi> (saith <hi>Ragneau) ains ont este accordeès durant la necessite des affaires seulement.</hi> Afterwards they were continually levyed in times of war; and at length <hi>Chales</hi> the VII. made them ordinary.

For supposing this, that the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> containeth 200 millions of Acres (as it doth) and that from every acre there were raised to the King two Sols yearly, which is little in respect of what the Taxes impose upon them: That income alone, besides that which is levyed on Goods personall, would amount to two millions of pounds in a year.

                        </gap>st I undertook to attend upon my Lord of <hi>Danby</hi> to the Islands of <hi>Guernzey</hi> and <hi>Jarsey;</hi> besides the purpose which I had of doing service to his Lordship, I resolved also to do somewhat for my self: and, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:54833:164"/>
what I could my understanding, if peradventure the persons or the place might add unto me the knowledge of any one thing, to which I was a stranger. At the least I was in hope to satisfy my curiosity, as being not a little emulous of this kind of living, <hi>Multorum mores hominum qui vidit &amp; urbes;</hi> which had seen so much of men and of their manners. It was also not the last part of mine intention, to do something in the honour of the Island, by committing to memory their Antiquities, by reporting to posterity their Arts of Government, by representing, as in a Tablet, the choycest of their beauties; and in a word, by reducing these and the Achievements of the people, as far as the light of Authors could direct me, into the body of an History. But when I had a little made my self acquainted with the place and people, I found nothing in them which might put me to that trouble. The Churches naked of all Monuments, and not so much as the blazon of an Armes permitted in a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, for fear, as I conjecture, of Idolatry. No actions of importance to be heard of in their Legends, in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancers; whereby to ennoble them in time to come, unlesse perhaps some slight allarmes from <hi>France,</hi> may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion speech of them in our common Chronicles. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, indeed, exceeding pleasant and delight some, but yet so small in the extent and circuit, that to speak much of them, were to put the shooe of <hi>Hercules</hi> upon the foot of an Infant. For being in themselves, an abridgement only of the greater works of nature, how could the character and description of them be improved into a Volume? Having thus failed in the most of my designes, I applyed my self to make enquirie after their form of Government, in which, I must needs confesse, I met with much which did exceedingly affect me. Their Lawes, little beholding in the composition of them, to <hi>Justinian;</hi> and of no great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity with the laws of <hi>England,</hi> which we call Municipall or common. The grand Customarie o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Normandy,</hi> is of most credit with them; and that indeed the only rule by which they are directed, save that in some few passages it hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by our Prince, for the conveniency of this people.</p>

                        </gap>st I resolved upon the Journey; as little dreaming that any alterations had lately hapned in the Churches of those Islands, or that those alterations could afford one such varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. An Argument more sutable to my profession, as having had the honour to be reputed with the Clergy; and such as in it self may justly be intituled to your Lordships patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage.

                     <p>Which that I may the better do, in discharge of the trust reposed in me, and for your Lordships more ample satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I shall proceed in this order following.</p>
                     <p>First, I shall lay before your Lordship, the full successe and course of our Navigation, till we were setled in those Islands; that so the rest of this discourse being more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall, may receive no interruption in the processe of it.</p>
                     <p>Next, I shall briefly, as in a map, present your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with the situation, quality and story of the Islands; with somewhat also of their Customes, of their Government; but this (as the great Cardinall acknowledgeth the Popes power in temporall affaires) <hi>in ordine tantum ad spiritualia:</hi> the better to acquaint you with the occurrents of their Churches.</p>

against all invasions. This order signified to his Lordship about the beginning of <hi>December, anno</hi> 1628. he chearfully embraced the service, and prepared accordingly. But being deserted by his own Chaplaines in regard of the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the season, and the visible danger of the enterprise, he proposed the businesse of that attendance unto me (not otherwise relating to him then as to an honourable friend) in whom he found as great a readinesse and resolution, as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Sea was very calme and quiet, and the little breath of winde we had, made us move so slowly, that the afternoon was almost spent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had passed through the Needles, a dangerous pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage at all times, except to such only who being well skilled in these sharpe points, and those dread<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Being got beyond them at the last, though we had got more Sea roome, we had little more winde, which made us move as slowly as before we did, so that we spent the greatest part of the night with no swifter motion, then what was given us by the tide. About 3 of the clock in the morning we had winde enough, but we had it directly in our teeth, which would have quickly brought us to the place we had parted from, if a great Miste arising toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Sun, had not induced our Mariners to keep themselves aloofe in the open Sea for fear of falling on those Rocks wherewith the Southside of the <hi>Wight</hi> is made unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessable. About 2 of the clock in the afternoon, the winds turning somewhat Eastward, we made on again, but with so little speed, and to so little purpose, that all that night we were fain to lie at <hi>Hull</hi> (as the Mariners phrase it) without any sensible moving either backward or forward, but so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easily withall, that it must be a very great tempest indeed,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:54833:166"/>
which gives a passenger a more sickly and unpleasing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For my part I had found my self good Sea-proof in my Voyage to <hi>France,</hi> and was not much troubled with those disturbances to which the greatest part of our Land-men were so sensibly subject. On Thursday morning about day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break being within sight of <hi>Portland,</hi> and the winde serving very fitly, we made again for the Islands.

And finally, advising the common Souldiers to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with such sobriety and moderation towards the natives of the Countrey, (for as for their valour towards the enemies he would make no question) as to give no offence or scandall by their conversation. This said, the Assembly was dissolved, to the great satisfaction of all parties present; the night ensuing and the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being spent for the most part in the entertainments of rest and pleasures.</p>
                     <p>The only businesse of that day was the disposing of the three Barks which we took in our Journey, the goods whereof having before been inventoried and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by some Commissioners of the Town, and now exposed to open sale, were for the most part, bought together with the Barks themselves by that very <hi>Holland man of warre,</hi> whom they had hired to be their Convoy: Which gave me such a Character of the mercenary and sordid nature of that people, that of all men living, I should never desire to have any thing to do with them, unlesse they might be made use of (as the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> were) in <hi>hewing wood, and drawing water for the use of the Tabernacle;</hi> I mean in doing servile offices to some mightier State which would be sure to keep them under.</p>

The Castle divided from the Town and Haven, by the inter-cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of the Sea; in which respect we were fain to make use of the Castle-hall in stead of a Chappell. The way to the Town Church being too troublesome and uncertain to give us the constant use of that, and the Castle yeelding no place else of a fit capacity for the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of so many as gave their diligent attendance at Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious exercises.</p>
                     <p>On Monday, <hi>March</hi> the 16. our Fleet went out to Sea againe, taking the <hi>Charles</hi> with them for their greater strength, which to that end was speedily unladen of such ammunition as was designed for the use of that Island.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Nothing considerable else in the time of our stay, but that our Fleet came back on Wednesday, <hi>March</hi> 25, which hapned very fitly to compleat the triumph of the Friday following, being the day of his Majesties most happy inauguration; celebrated in the Castle, by the Divine Service for that day, and after by a noble <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Nay when the <hi>French</hi> had twice seized on them, during the Reign of that unhappy Prince, and the state of <hi>England</hi> was embroyled at home, the people valiantly made good their own, and faithfully returned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their first obedience. In aftertimes as any war grew hot between the <hi>English</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> these Islands were principally aimed at by the enemy, and sometimes also were attempted by them, but with ill successe. And certainly, it could not be but an eye sore to the <hi>French,</hi> to have these <hi>Isles</hi> within their sight, and not within their power; to see them at the least in possession of their ancient enemy the <hi>English;</hi> a Nation strong in shipping, and likely by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of these places to annoy their trade.

An opportunity neglected by our former Kings in their attempts upon that Nation, as not being then so powerfull on the Seas as now they are, but likely for the future to be husbanded to the best advantage, if the <hi>French</hi> hereafter stir against us. Sure I am, that my Lord of <hi>Danby</hi> conceived this course of all others to be the fittest, for the impoverishing if not undoing of the <hi>French;</hi> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made proposition by his Letters to the Councell, that a squadron of eight Ships (<hi>viz</hi> five of the <hi>Whelpes,</hi> the <hi>Assurance,</hi> the <hi>Adventure</hi> and the <hi>Catch</hi>) might be employed about these Islands for that purpose. An advice which had this Summer

took effect, had not the Peace between both Realms, been so suddenly concluded.</p>
                        <p>Of these, four only are inhabited, and those reduced only unto two Governments; <hi>Jarsey</hi> an entire Province as it were within it self; but that of <hi>Guernzey</hi> having the other two of <hi>Alderney</hi> and <hi>Serke</hi> dependant on it. Hence it is, that in our Histories, and in our Acts of Parliament, we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only of <hi>Jarsey</hi> and of <hi>Guernzey,</hi> this last comprehending under it the two other. The people of them all live as it were-in <hi>libera custodia,</hi> in a kind of free subjection; not any way acquainted with Taxes, or with any levies either of men or money. In so much, that when the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> contribute towards the occasion of their Princes, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a proviso in the Act, <q>That this grant of Subsidies or any thing therein contained, extend not to charge the inhabitants of <hi>Guernzey</hi> and <hi>Jarsey,</hi> or any of them, of, for or concerning any Mannors, Lands, and Tenements, or other possessions, Goods, Chattels, or other moveable substance, which they the said Inhabitants, or any other to their uses, have within <hi>Jarsey</hi> and <hi>Guernzey,</hi> or in any of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </q> These priviledges and immunities (together with divers others) seconded of late dayes with the more powerfull band of Religion, have been a principall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of that constancy, wherewith they have persisted faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in their allegiance, and disclaimed even the very name and thought of <hi>France.</hi> For howsoever the language which they speak is <hi>French,</hi> and that in their originall, they either were of <hi>Normandy</hi> or <hi>Britagne;</hi> yet can they with no patience endure to be accounted <hi>French,</hi> but call themselves by the names of <hi>English-Normans.</hi> So much doth liberty, or at the worst a gentle yoak, prevail upon the mind and fancy of the people.</p>
                        <p>To proceed unto particulars, we will take them as they lie in order, beginning first with that of <hi>Alderney,</hi> an Island called by <hi>Antonine, Arica,</hi> but by the <hi>French</hi> and in our old Records known by the name of <hi>Aurigny</hi> and <hi>Aurney.</hi> It is situate in the 49 degree between 48 &amp; 52 minutes of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, just over against the Cape or promontory of the <hi>Lexobii,</hi> called at this time by the Mariners the <hi>Hague.</hi> Distant from

this Cape or Promontory three leagues only, but thirty at the least from the nearest part of <hi>England.</hi> The aire healthy, though some imes thickned with the vapours arising from the Sea. The soil indifferently rich both for husbandry and grasing. A Town it hath of well-near an hundred fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and not far off, an haven made in the manner of a semicircle, which they call <hi>Crabbie.</hi> The principall strength of it, are the high rocks, with which it is on every side envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned, but especially upon the South; and on the East side an old Block-house, which time hath made almost unser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable. The chief house herein belongeth unto the <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlains,</hi> as also the dominion or Fee-farme of all the Island, it being granted by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> unto <hi>George</hi> the son of Sir <hi>Leonard Chamberlain,</hi> then Governour of <hi>Guernzey,</hi> by whose valour it was recovered from the <hi>French,</hi> who in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes had seized upon it.

                        <p>During the reign of the late Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who for her husband <hi>Philips</hi> sake, had engaged her self in a war against the <hi>French;</hi> this Island then not peopled, was suddenly surprized by those of that Nation, but by a Gentleman of the Netherlands, a subject of King <hi>Philips</hi> thus regained, as the story much to this purpose is related by Sir <hi>Wal. Raleigh.</hi> The <hi>Flemish</hi> Gentleman with a small Bark came to Anchor in the road, and pretending the death of his Merchant, besought the <hi>French</hi> that they might bury him in the Chappell of that Island, offering a present to them of such commodity as they had aboard. To this request the <hi>French</hi> were easily entreated, but yet upon condition that they should not come on shoar with any weapon, no not so much as with a knife. This leave obtained, the <hi>Fleming</hi> rowed unto the shoar with a Coffin in their Skiffe for that use purposely provided, and manned with Swords and Arcubuishes. Upon their landing, and a search so strict and narrow, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to hide a pen-knife; they were permitted to draw their Coffin up the Rocks, some of the <hi>French</hi> rowing back unto the Ship to fetch the present, where they were soon made fast enough and laid in hold. The <hi>Flemings</hi> in the mean time which were on land, had carryed their Coffin into the Chappell, and having taken thence their weapons, gave an alarme upon the <hi>French,</hi> who taken thus upon the suddain, and seeing no hopes of succour from their fellowes, yeelded themselves, and abandoned the possession of that place.

                        <p>Two leagues from <hi>Serke</hi> directly Westward, lyeth the chief Island of this Government, by <hi>Antonine</hi> called <hi>Sarnia;</hi> by Us and the <hi>French</hi> known now by the name of <hi>Garnzey,</hi> or of <hi>Guernzey.</hi> Situate in the 49 degree of Latitude, between the 39 and 46 minutes of that degree, eight leagues or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts from the coast of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and well-neer in an equall distance from <hi>Alderney</hi> and <hi>Jarsey.</hi> The forme of it, is much after the fashion of the Isle of <hi>Sicily,</hi> every side of the triangle being about nine miles in length, and 28 in the whole compasse. In this circuit are comprehended ten Parishes, whereof the principall is that of St. <hi>Peters</hi> on the Sea, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a fair and safe peer adjoyning to it for the benefit of their Merchants, and being honoured also with a Market, and the <hi>Plaidery</hi> or Court of Justice. The number of the Inhabitants is reckoned neer about twenty thousand, out of which there may be raised some two thousand able men; although their trained Band consists only of twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and those, God knows, but poorly weaponed. The aire hereof is very healthfull, as may be well seen in the long lives both of men and women; and the earth said to be of the same nature with <hi>Crete</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> not apt to foster any venemous creature in it. Out of which generall affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we may do well to except <hi>Witches,</hi> of whom the people here have strange reports, and if an Ox or Horse perhaps miscarry, they presently impute it to <hi>Witcheraft,</hi> and the next old woman shall straight be hal'd to Prison. The ground it self, in the opinion of the Natives, more rich and battle then that of <hi>Jarsey;</hi> yet not so fruitfull in the harvest, because the people addict themselves to merchandise especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, leaving the care of husbandry unto their hindes. Yet Bread they have sufficient for their use; enough of Cattell both for themselves and for their ships; plenty of Fish con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually brought in from the neighbour seas, and a Lake on the Northwest part of it, neer unto the sea, of about a mile or more in compasse, exceeding well stored with Carpes, the best that ever mortall eye beheld, for tast and bignesse.</p>

                           <pb n="298" facs="tcp:54833:173"/>Some other Isles yet there be pertaining unto this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Guernzey,</hi> but not many nor much famous. Two of them lie along betwixt it and <hi>Serke, viz. Arvie,</hi> and <hi>Jet-how,</hi> whereof this last serveth only as a Parke unto the Governour, and hath in it a few fallow Deer, and good plenty of Conies. The other of them is well-neer three miles in circuit, a solitary dwelling once of Canons regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and afterwards of some Fryers of the Order of St. <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> but now only inhabited by Pheasants, of which amongst the shrubs and bushes, there is said to be no scarcity. The least of them, but yet of most note, is the little Islet called <hi>Lehu,</hi> situate on the North side of the Eastern corner, and neer unto those scattered rockes, which are called <hi>Les Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waux,</hi> appertaining once unto the Dean, but now unto the Governour. Famous for a little Oratory or Chantery there once erected and dedicated to the honour of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> who by the people in those times, was much sued to by the name of our Lady of <hi>Lehu.</hi> A place long since demolished in the ruine of it, <hi>Sed jam pèriere ruinae,</hi> but now the ruines of it are scarce visible, there being almost no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left of it but the steeple, which serveth only as a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke, and to which as any of that party sail along, they strike their top sail. <hi>Tantum religio potuit suadere,</hi> such a Religious opinion have they harboured of the place, that though the Saint be gone, the wals yet shall still be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.</p>
                        <p>But indeed, the principall honour and glory of this Island, I mean of <hi>Guernzey,</hi> is the large capaciousnesse of the harbour, and the flourishing beauty of the Castle; I say the Castle, as it may so be called by way of eminency, that in the vale, and those poorer trifles all along the Coasts, not any way deserving to be spoken of. Situate it is upon a little Islet just opposite unto <hi>Pierport</hi> or the Town of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> on the Sea; to which, and to the peere there it is a good assurance, and takes up the whole circuit of that Islet whereupon it standeth. At the first it was built upon the higher part of the ground only, broad at the one end, and at the other, and bending in the fashion of an horne, whence it had the name of <hi>Cornet.</hi> By Sir <hi>Leonard Chamb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Governour here in the time of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and by Sir <hi>Thomas Leighton</hi> his successour in the reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it was improved to that majesty and beauty that now it hath, excellently fortified according to the moderne art of war, and furnished with almost an hundred piece of Ordinance, whereof about sixty are of Brasse. Add to this, that it is continually environed with the Sea, unlesse some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at a dead-low water, whereby there is so little possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of making any approaches neer unto it, that one might justly think him mad, that would attempt it. And certainly it is more then necessary that this place should be thus fortified, if not for the safety of the Island, yet at the least for the assurance of the Harbour. An harbour able to contain the greatest Navy that ever sailed upon the Ocean; fenced from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Other Havens they have about the Island, <hi>viz.

                        <p>For other strengths this Island is in part beholding unto Nature, and somewhat also unto Art. To Nature which hath guarded it with Rocks, and Shelves, and other shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low places very dangerous; but neither these, nor those of Art, so serviceable and full of safety, as they be in <hi>Guernzey.</hi> Besides the landing places, here are more, and more accessible, as namely the Bay of St. <hi>Owen,</hi> and the Havens of St. <hi>Burlade, Boule,</hi> St. <hi>Katharines,</hi> with divers others. There is, indeed, one of them, and that the principall, sufficiently assured; on the one side by a little <hi>Blockhouse,</hi> which they call <hi>Mount St. Aubin;</hi> and on the other by a fair Castle, called the Fort <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth.</hi> The Harbour it self is of a good capacity, in figure like a semicircle or a crescent, and by reason of the Town adjoyning, known by the name of the Haven of St. <hi>Hilaries.</hi> On that side of it next the Town, and in a little Islet of it self is situate the Castle, environed with the Sea at high water, but at an ebb easily accessible by land; but yet so natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended with sharpe Rocks and craggy clistes, that
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:54833:175"/>
though the accesse unto it may be easie, yet the surprizall would be difficult. It was built not long since by our late Queen of famous memory, at such times as the Civill warres were hot in <hi>France</hi> about Religion, and the Kings Forces drawn downwards towards <hi>Normandy.</hi> Furnished with 30 pieces of Ordinance and upwards; and now, upon the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the <hi>French,</hi> there are some new works begun about it, for the assurance of that well. On the East side, just opposite and in the view of the City of <hi>Constantia,</hi> there is seated on an high and craggy rock, a most strong Castle, and called by an haughty name <hi>Mount Orgueil;</hi> of whose founder I could learn nothing, nor any other thing which might concern it in matter of antiquity, save that it was repaired and beautified by <hi>Henry</hi> V. It is for the most part the inhabitatiou of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, who is Captain of it; stored with about some forty pieces of Ordinance, and guarded by some five and twenty wardours. A place of good service for the safety of the Island; if perhaps it may not be commanded, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noied by an hill adjoyning, which doth equall, if not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top it.</p>
                        <p>This Island, as before we noted, is some 33 miles in compasse, comprehending in it 12 Parishes, whereof the principall is that of S. <hi>Hilaries.</hi> A Town so called from an antient Father of that name, and Bishop of <hi>Poyctiers</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> whose body they suppose to be interred in a little Chappell neer unto the Fort <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and consecrated to his memory. But of his buriall here, they have nothing further then tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and that unjustifiable; for St <hi>Jerome</hi> telleth us, that after his return from <hi>Phrygia,</hi> whereunto he had been confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he dyed in his own City; and we learn in the <hi>Roman Martyrologie,</hi> that his <hi>Obit</hi> is there celebrated on the 13 of <hi>January.</hi> The chief name the which this Town now hath, is for the conveniency of the Haven, the Market there every Saturday, and that it is honoured with the <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                                 <desc>•…</desc>
                              </gap>u</hi> or <hi>Sessions house</hi> for the whole Island. The other Villages lie scattered up and down, like those of <hi>Guernzey,</hi> and give habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a people very painfull and laborious; but by reason of their continuall toyle and labour, not a little affected to a kinde of melancholy surlinesse incident to plough men.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:54833:175"/>
Those of <hi>Guernzey</hi> on the other side, by continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>ll converse with strangers in their own haven, and by travailing abroad being much more sociable and generous. Add to this, that the people here are more poor, and therefore more destitute of humanity; the children here continually craving almes of every stranger; whereas in all <hi>Guernzey</hi> I did not see one begger.</p>
                        <p>A principall reason of which poverty, I suppose to be their exceeding populousnesse, there being reckoned in so small a quantity of ground, neer upon thirty thousand li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving souls. A matter which gave us no small cause of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and when my Lord of <hi>Danby</hi> seemed to wonder, how such a span of earth could contain such multitudes of people, I remember that Sir <hi>John Payton</hi> the Lieutenant Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, made him this answer, <hi>viz.</hi> That the people mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried within themselves like Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>

                        <p>A second reason of their poverty (add also of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers) may be the little liking they have to Trafick; whereby as they might have advantage to improve themselves, and employ their poor; so also might that service casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diminish their huge multitudes, by the losse of some men, and diverting others from the thought of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
                        <p>But the main cause, as I conceive it, is the tenure of their Lands, which are equally to be divided amongst all the Sons of every Father, and those parcels also to be subdivided even <hi>ad infinitnm.</hi> Hence is it, that in all the Countries you shall hardly finde a field of Corne of larger compasse then an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Garden; every one now having a little to himself, and that little made lesse to his posterity. This Tenure our Lawyers call by the name of <hi>Gavel-kinde;</hi> that is, as some of them expound it, <hi>Give all-kinne,</hi> because it is amongst them all to be divided. For thus the Law speaking of the customes of <hi>Kent,</hi> in the 16 Chap. <hi>De praerogativa Regis. Ibidem omnes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But which is most of all, in case the Father be attaint of Felony or Murder, there is no <hi>Escheat</hi> of it to the Lord; the whole Estate, after the King hath had <hi>Diem annum &amp; vastum,</hi> descending on the Heires. <hi>Et post annum &amp; diem terrae &amp; tenementa reddentur, &amp; revert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>On the other side, by this means their estates are infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly distracted, their houses impoverished, the Kings profits in his Subsidies diminished, and no little disadvantage to the publick service, in the finding of Armours for the Wars. Whereupon, as many Gentlemen of <hi>Kent</hi> have altered by especiall Acts of Parliament, the antient Tenure of their Lands, and reduced it unto <hi>Knights-service;</hi> so is it wished by the better sort of this people, and intended by some of them, that their Tenure may be also altered and brought into the same condition.

The childe being brought, and that holy action so far for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that they were come to the naming of the childe, they named it <hi>Richard:</hi> which was the name of the Infants Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father by the Mothers side. Upon this a stop was made, nor would he be perswaded to baptize the childe; unlesse the name of it were altered: which when the Godfather refused to do, he forsook the place, and the childe was carried back unchristned. To this purpose, but not in the same words, the whole history. But if the name of <hi>Richard</hi> be so <hi>Paganish,</hi> what then shall we conceive of these; <hi>The Lord is near, More-tryall, Joy-again, Free-gift, From-above,</hi> and others of that stamp? are they also extant in the Scripture?</p>

as a person answerable to the Governors commendations; he was established in that office by Letters Patents from his Majesty, dated the 8. of <hi>March, anno</hi> 1619. and was invested with all such rights as formerly had been inherent in that dignity: and that both in point of profit; and also in point of jurisdiction. For whereas formerly the Dean was setled in the best benefice in the Island, that <hi>viz.</hi> of St <hi>Martins;</hi> and had divers portions of tithes out of every of the Parishes: the said St. <hi>Martins</hi> was allotted to him, upon the next avoidance; aud the whole tithes of St. <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> allowed him, in consideration of his several parcels. And whereas also at the suppression of the <hi>Deanry,</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor had taken into his hands the probate of Testaments, and appointed unto civil Courts the cognizance of Matrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all causes and of tithes: all these again were restored unto him, and forever united to this office.</p>
                        <p>For the executing of this place, there were some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Articles, or rather Canons drawn and ratified to be in force till a perfect draught of Ecclesiastical constitutions could be agreed on: which it pleased his Majesty to call the <hi>Interim.</hi> And this he did in imitation of <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. which Prince, desirous to establish peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the Church of <hi>Germany;</hi> and little hoping that any Councel would be summoned soon enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of the differences then on foot: composed a certain mixture of opinions, in favour of each party; which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured to obtrude upon that people: the compilers of it, <hi>Julius Pflugiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But this disgust was quickly over-blown; and the Bailiffe for four years suspended by his Majesty from the executing of his office. This done, his fellow Ministers were called together, and he imparted unto them his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. All of them seeming well contented with the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction (<hi>De la place</hi> excepted) who much impatient (as commonly the miscarrying of our hopes as much torments us, as the losse of a possession) to see himself deluded, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook the Countrey.

<pb n="417" facs="tcp:54833:232"/>
that importance as the former. The one, that the remainders of that party here at home, may not be hardned in their obstinacy; the other, that those of <hi>Jarsey,</hi> be not discouraged in their submission and conformity. I have already shewn unto your Lordship, that the brethren here in <hi>England,</hi> never made head against the Church, till the permission of plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme in these Islands. After which, with what violence they did assaile the hierarchy, what clamorus they continually raised against the Prelates, what superstitions and impieties they imputed to our <hi>Liturgy; notius est quam ut stylo egeat,</hi> is too wel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> to be related. If so, then questionless it cannot but confirme them in their new devices, to see them still permitted to this Isle. Nor can they think themselves but wronged, that still they are contrould and censured for the maintenance of that discipline, which is by Soveraign authority allowed and licensed; though in other places, yet in the same dominions. And on the other side, your Lordship may conceive how just a cause of discontent and of repining it may be to those of <hi>Jarsey;</hi> when they shall dayly hear it thundred from the Coasts of <hi>France,</hi> that faintly they have sold themselves to bondage; whereas the faithfull zelots in the Isle of <hi>Guernzey,</hi> doe still preserve themselves in liberty. <hi>Vel neutrum flammis ure, vel ure duos,</hi> as the Lover in <hi>Ausonius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From my first rank of motives here presented to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which I may most properly call <hi>motives necessary,</hi> and in respect unto the cause; I come next to those of an other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which I call <hi>motives</hi> of <hi>conveniency,</hi> and in r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>lation to the time. For questionlesse the time is at this present more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the accomplishment of this work, then ever we may hope to see hereafter; whether we consider it in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto our Kingdome, or to the <hi>Discipline</hi> it self, or to the Governour, or to the people of both sorts, the Clergy and the Magistrates.</p>
                        <p>For first, there is at this instant, an established peace between it and <hi>France,</hi> concluded on while we were in these Islands, and published immediately on our coming home; which Realm only carryeth a covetous and wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="418" facs="tcp:54833:233"/>
be unsafe, it being alwayes dangerous to discontent or charge that Nation, upon whose loyalty we must rely. Nor can I tell unto what desperate and undutifull practises, the furious heat of some few Preachers may possibly excite a multitude; when come the worst that can, there is an enemy at hand that will subscribe to any articles. But now tis peace, and how long peace will hold, is not easie to determine, depending as it doth, upon the will and pleasure of another.</p>
                        <p>If, in the second place, we look upon the <hi>Discipline</hi> it self, we shall find it well prepared, and ready for a change. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is ordered in their <hi>Canons</hi> (if I so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

So then either the sentence of the <hi>Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie</hi> must be unalterable, which is expresly contrary to the platforme; or else there must be granted some other <hi>jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to have power above them, whereby their censures may be moderated.

In my life I never knew men more willing to betray a cause, or lesse able to maintain it. My inference hereupon is this, that if his Majesty should signifie unto them, that it is his royall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to admit a <hi>Dean</hi> among them, or else repair unto the Court to give a reaso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

particular, as I stand well affected to <hi>Perchard,</hi> for a moderate and quiet man, so hath he also a good repute in all the Island, both for his vein of Preaching, his liberall hospitality, and plausible demeanor. Or if your Lordship think a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainer more fit, there being now the Parish of St. <hi>Saviours</hi> void, and so full room for that <hi>induction,</hi> I durst propose to you <hi>Olivier</hi> of <hi>Jarsey;</hi> a man which I perswade my self, I may say safely, not inferiour unto any of both Islands in point of Scholarship, and well affected to the <hi>English</hi> form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Add to this that already he is acquainted with the nature of the place, as having executed the office of the <hi>Commissary</hi> or <hi>Subdean,</hi> ever since the introduction of the charge, and therefore not to seek in the managing and cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his jurisdiction. But good God! what follies do we dayly run into, when we conceive our selves to be disguised, and that our actions are not noted? It is therefore high time for me to unmaske my self, and humbly crave your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships pardon, that under any habit I should take upon me to advise. A further <hi>plaudite</hi> then this I do not seek for, then that you will vouchsafe to excuse my boldnesse, though not allow it: the rather because a zeal unto the beauteous uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the Church did prompt me to it. But this, and this discourse, such as it is, I consecrate unto your Lordship; for whose honour, next under Gods, I have principally pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued this argument. For my self, it will be unto me sufficient glory, that I had any, though the least, hand in such a pious work; and shall be happy, if in this, or in any other your Lordships counsels for the Churches peace, I may be worthy of imployment. Nor need your Lordship fear, that in the prosecution of this project, you may be charged with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation. To pursue this purpose is not to introduce a <hi>novelty</hi> but to restore a <hi>Discipline,</hi> to revive the perfect service of God, which so long hath been, to say the best of it, in a <hi>Lethargy,</hi> and to make the <hi>Jerusalem</hi> of the <hi>English Empire,</hi> like a <hi>City which is at unity within it self.</hi>
