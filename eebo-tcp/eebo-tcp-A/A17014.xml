            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>And the more plainely to demonſtrate this, when I come to the firſt plantinge of the faith of Christ, in this kingdome in the Apostles time, I will make manifest, by all testimonies, and antiquities, that Chriſt our bleſsed Sauiour and Meſsias accordingly to the propheſies of him did inſtitute this ſacrificing priesthood, and both celebrated, and ordeined the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Maſse for his Church for euer. That all his Apostles were ſacrificing maſsing preiſts, and offered that bleſſed ſacrifice And that in this kingdome of Britanie in particular, as in the whole Chriſtian world beſides, in euery age, and hundred of yeares, from the first preachinge, and receiuing of Chriſtian Religion here, in the Apostles time, in the first, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, third, fourthe, fift, and ſix hundred yeares, of Chriſt, and ſo longe as the best learned protestants affirme, that holy primatiue Church remained vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted, in the firſt receiued truthe, and integritie thereof.</p>
                  <p>The ſame holy ſacrificing priesthood, a continual
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19358:4"/>
ſucceſsion of ſacrificinge maſsinge preiſts, and Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, and ſacrifice of Maſſe euer continued here, in the ſame maner as they are now vſed and obſerued in the preſent Romane Church, without any the least eſſentiall change, or difference. By reaſon whereof many cheife Articles in Religion now queſtioned, as the ſupernaturall change or tranſubſtantiation of bread and wine into the bleſsed body, and blood of Christ, there offered a propitiatorie ſacrifice for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne; prayer to the bleſſed Virgin, S. Mary, &amp; other Saints, and Angels, prayer for the faithfull depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, merit of ſacrifice, and good workes, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiencie of ſole faith, and other principall things which proteſtants commonly diſallow in Catholicke Religion, will bee thus proued, and deduced in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie age, in this our Britanie, euen with the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our best learned protestants, and ſuch anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, as they approue, and cannot diſallow. One most materiall point of the Popes power and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall prerogatiue in this nation, from the first em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracinge of Christian Religion in all ages, which I promiſed in my firſt parte, I vnderstand to bee effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually performed already. Therefore I shall ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie make mention thereof, in this hiſtory, except in ſome things, and places, where it shall bee needfull for the more perfect handlinge of the preſent ſubiect of this worke.</p>
                  <p>And hereby it will ſufficiently appeare, vnto all protestants, and perſecutors of the holy Catholike Romane Church, that ſeeing the controuerſie is, whether the Catholike, or protestant church is the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19358:4"/>
true church of Christ, that by no poſsibilitie the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant congregation can bee this true and holie church. For by their owne Articles of their Religion, to which all proteſtant Bishops and miniſters haue sworne and ſubſcribed. (Articl. of Engl. proteſt. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig. articul. <hi>19.) The viſible Church of Chriſt is a congregation of faithfull men, in which the pure worde of God is preached, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments bee duly miniſtred, according to Chriſts ordinance, in all thoſe things that are requiſite to the ſame.</hi> Which bee the verie wordes of their owne ſubſcribed, and sworne Article of Religion.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when they require three things to the true Church, true and lawfullie conſecrated preists, and preachers, the pure word of God preached, and Sacraments duely ministred, and all theſe shall be found in the Roman Church in all ages from the firſt preaching of Christ, and not any one of them in the proteſtant parlamentary Church of England, or any ſuch other, but a manifeſt oppoſition and perſecution of thoſe ſacred preachers of the word, and miniſters of the Sacraments, as of the word, and Sacraments themſelues, ſo preached, and miniſtred, none of theſe can poſsibly bee the true Church of Chriſt, but a company of profeſſed aduerſaries and enemies vnto it: and that the onely true Church which they haue ſo vnchriſtianly perſecuted the Catholike Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> church is that true and most holy church of Chriſt.</p>

Being thus directed by theſe proteſtants and by their direction, I make this Argument and proofe from ſcriptures as they tranſlate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Euery high preiſt is ordeined to offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſinnes. (<hi>Hebr.</hi> 5.1.8.3.) But Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech was an high preiſt: Therefore ordeyned to offer ſacrifice for ſinnes. The firſt or maior propoſition, is the very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of S. Paule, as our proteſtants tranſlate him. The minor or ſecond propoſition, is theire tranſlation of the Prophet Moiſes: <hi>Melchiſedech was the preist of the most high God. (Gen.</hi> 14.18.) Where hee is called, <hi>the preist,</hi> by excellency and bleſſing Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and called by S Paule, better or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then Abraham. (<hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.6.7.9.) Who alſo was a great preiſt and patriarke, and as a ſuperiour receauing tithes of him: and ſo eminent and cheife, that the order of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19358:11"/>
which hee was, is not onely called the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Melchiſedech, but Chriſt himſelfe often termed high preiſt after the order of Melchiſedech: and as our proteſtants alſo tranſlate, after the ſimilitude of Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech, as both the Greeke and Latine texts alſo are: Therefore Melchiſedech of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie was an high preiſt. Therefore againe the concluſion, which in a true Argument and Sillogiſme, as this is, cannot bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that Melchiſedech offered ſacrifice, beeing therto ordeyned, is moſt certaine and an article of faith by theſe proteſtants Religion before.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. And becauſe by the rule of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, wee may not ſeeke but in ſcripture to knowe what ſacrifice it was, which hee offered, it muſt needes bee that ſacrifice of bread and wine, which the ſcripture Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, Fathers, and forreine proteſtants haue told vs of before: for wee do not find any other ſacrifice, or matter like a ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce in ſcripture attributed to Melchiſedech.

vnproperly, but by true conſequence blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly ſpoken, vtterly denyinge that either the preiſts of the Lawe of Nature, or Moiſes, or Chriſt did offer any ſacrifice, and ſo no ſacrifice for ſinne beeinge offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Chriſt, mans redemption was not wrought by Chriſt, but man is vnredee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and Chriſt was not the Sauiour of the world; for in that place as S. Paul ſpeaketh of euery high preiſt and preiſtly orders, he alſo ſpeaketh of the externall ſacrifices of of them, in their order and time. And ſo doth the proteſtant publicke gloſſe vppon thoſe wordes of S.

For Chriſt was carried in his owne hands, when ſpeaking of his owne body, he ſaith. This is my body. For he carried that body in his owne hands.

                        <hi>THE X. CHAPTER.</hi> Wherin is particularly proued of all the holy Apoſtles and Euangeliſts, that they were ſacrificinge maſsinge preists, and did both practiſe and teach the ſame doctrines. And first the <hi>4.</hi> Euangelists and S. Paule, who haue reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred theſe misteries in holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</head>
                     <p>THis being thus inuincibly proued, and acknowledged, both by Catholicke and Proteſtant authoritie, that both Chriſt our Sauiour inſtituted this holy ſacrifice, and ſacrificinge preiſthood; and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles receauinge them from him, did all in generall both exerciſe and deliuer the ſame vnto the churches, there can bee no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian deſirous to retaine that name, that may oppoſe againſt the ſame; yet for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſtation of theſe truthes, vnto all, that will not deſperatly dwell in error, I will now proue in particular, how euery one of the Apoſtles, and Euangeliſts, both beleeued, practiſed, and taught theſe miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And firſt to begin with the foure E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſts,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:19358:67"/>
and S. Paule, who haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted theſe Chriſtian holy ſecrets, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie writinge; I will ſhew how both in theſe their ſacred ſcriptures, they teach and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the ſacrifice of Maſſe, and a ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinge or maſſinge preiſthood, by order and ſacred office to offer that ſacrifice. And to put vs out of all doubt or queſtion that this is and was theire meaninge in thoſe holy ſcriptures, I will proue, that euery one of them was a true maſſinge preiſt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually did offer, and celebrate the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable ſacrifice of Maſſe, in eſſential thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as the holy Catholicke maſſing preiſts of the church of Rome now doe, and haue euer moſt religiouſly done, in all ages. The ſame I will likewiſe proue, of all the other Apoſtles, in their order, onely I will craue leaue of S. Peter, the firſt, and cheifeſt, to remember him laſte in this matter; for as I haue proued at large in other places, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the Apoſtles hee was the firſt, and allmoſte onely Apoſtle, which planted the faith of Chriſt in theſe parts of the world: So wee in Britanie did firſt receaue from him, our holy maſſinge and ſacrificinge preiſts, and preiſthood, neuer hitherto al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:19358:68"/>
diſcontinued, or interrupted, but by him and his ſucceſſors in the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke ſea of Rome firſt founded, and euer after ſucceſſiuely in all ages preſerued in this kingdome, as will appeare hereafter.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Therefore to begin with the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts and S. Paule, which ſpeake of theſe miſteries in ſcripture, S. Mathew the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (and firſt in order amonge the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts) writeth of Chriſts deliuery of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in theſe wordes, as our Engliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants by his maieſties priuiledge tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them. (<hi>Matth. cap.</hi> 26. <hi>v.</hi> 26.27.28.) <hi>Ieſus tooke breade and bleſſed it, and brake it, and gaue it to his diſciples, and ſaid, take eate, this is my body. And hee tooke the cup, and gaue thankes, and gaue it to them ſavinge, drinke ye al of it for this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion of ſinnes.</hi> The Greeke text, which theſe men ſay muſt bee here preferred, is word by word as they tranſlate, ſpeakinge of Chriſts body, that it was at that preſent giuen there, and his blood in the preſent tence ſhed for remiſſion of ſinnes <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:19358:68"/>
vppon the Croſſe was a ſacrifice, as all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, ſeeing it was ſo in reſpect it was there giuen and offered for remiſſion of ſinnes, here beeing the very ſame body and blood, and giuen for remiſſion of ſinnes, it muſt needes bee alſo a ſacrifice, and not onely euchariſticall or of thanks giuing, but ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory: for whatſoeuer tal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>eth away ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, by its owne vertue, as the Euangeliſt here ſpeaketh of this, muſt needes be ſuch, and Chriſts body and blood beeing of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite value in themſelues and of their own nature, can not but be ſatisfactorie for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whenſoeuer, howſoeuer, &amp; by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they are offered, or giuen for remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes, though the limited power of preiſts may bringe ſome limitation to their ſatisfaction, the ordinance and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Chriſt, ſo diſpoſing in this ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as it is now daily offered by conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted preiſts, as the common opinion is, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe a thing of illimited worth, ſhould bee of like deſeruinge, and ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And this is ſo euident, that not onely all learned Fathers, and antiquitie do from hence teach, that Chriſt in this place inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the ſacrifice of the new teſtament, as
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:19358:69"/>
I haue cited diuers before, but our greateſt enemies and perſecutors, as namly the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Proteſtant Archbiſhop of Canterbury the director of Maſter Maſon, and hee alſo with others. (<hi>Maſon. praefat. &amp; lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 235. <hi>Abb. ibidem. Magdeburgent. in S. Iren.)</hi> acknowledge, particularly naminge S. Irenaeus, S. Chriſoſtome, and S.

(<hi>Maſon and D. Georg. Abbots ſupr. pag.</hi> 233.) that theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of Chriſt recited before by S. Matthew, <hi>this is my body which is giuen for you, and this is my blood of the new teſtament which is shed for you, doe argue a ſacrifice to God.</hi> And if this was not a ſacrifice, then by proteſtant Religion, admittinge nothing but ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in matters of faith, Chriſt Ieſus was not the preiſt after the order of Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech, which was promiſed; for exceptinge this, the whole new teſtament is ſilent of any preiſtly act, of that order, which hee performed in all his life, and ſo that being a diſtinctiue ſigne, of the true Meſſias, they
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:19358:69"/>
would depriue all mankinde of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and our moſte bleſſed Sauiour of the title, and honour of redeeminge vs. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus they graunt.

(<hi>Luc. cap.</hi> 22. <hi>ver.</hi> 19.) <hi>doe this in remembrance of mee.</hi> So that Chriſt ordeyninge, that we ſhould do what hee did, as the words bee manifeſt, and Chriſt as they confeſſe there, <hi>offered himſelfe for a ſoueraigne ſacrifice vnto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> we muſt offer Chriſt in the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for a ſoueraigne ſacrifice vnto God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. And for a cleare demonſtration, that together with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement a preiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſacrificinge power was giuen by thoſe wordes, to his holy Apoſtles, and they by them made maſſing, and ſacrificing preiſts, to ſacrifice, as Chriſt by theſe proteſtants,

and the ſcripture before, did at that time his bleſſed body, and body, it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or validate in either Religion of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, or Proteſtants, for any Chriſtian man, or woman to intermeddle to offer, or miniſter in theſe things, whatſoeuer we ſhall name them, or iudge them to bee, but a Catholickly conſecrated preiſt, by the one, or proteſtant miniſter by the other, therfore thoſe ſacred words, do this (<hi>Matth. cap.</hi> 26. <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>Marc. cap.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Luc. c.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 14.) gaue preiſtly and ſacrificing power to his Apoſtles, only preſent, by the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts: for if they had beene generally ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto all Chriſtians, all Chriſtians ſhould both haue power, &amp; were bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation to take vpon them to miniſter in ſuch things; for the wordes, <hi>doe this,</hi> to whomſoeuer they were ſpoken, conteyne an expreſſe commaundement, to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And to make this matter more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, it is manifeſt by the proteſtant parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtatute of Kinge Edward the ſixt, Queene Elizabeth, and King Iames. (<hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tut.</hi> 1. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Eliz. &amp;</hi> 1. <hi>Iacob. ſupr.</hi>) That the Proteſtants of England neither doe,

nor by their Religion may, make it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of commaundement and neceſſitie, for lay parſons to communicate vnder both kindes, but doe freely acknowledge, that in the firſt fiue hundred yeares of Chriſt, the Sacrament was miniſtred vnto, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued of the laitie ſometimes in one, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in both kindes, and yet the practiſe of the church was holy in thoſe dayes; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there neuer was a generall commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to al Chriſtians to receaue in both kindes: yet S.

And therefore Tatianus Alexandrinus diſciple to S. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine the martyr, in his harmony of the ghoſpels, doth ſet downe thoſe wordes of Chriſt to his Apoſtles.

words of Chriſt, then onely ſpoken vnto them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Which is made moſte euident in the caſe of S.

(ver.</hi> 24.) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when hee ſaid theſe words vnto them; but when the reſt of the Apoſtles told him they had ſeene Chriſt, it followeth in the ſame place by Engliſh Proteſtants reading: <hi>The other diſciples therefore ſaid vnto him, wee haue ſeene the Lord.

                     <p n="7">7. So that it is moſt plaine, and euident, that S.

Peter firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded here our eccleſiasticall Hierarchie, of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificinge maſsinge preists and Bishops.</head>
                     <p>NOw we may hope that no man being by name a Chriſtian, will bee ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite an Antichriſtian, to thinke, that Chriſt which could not teache errors, or contrary doctrines, and deliuered but one, and the ſame true, and infallible Religion to the whole world, for all places, people, and ages, had one Religion for the reſt of the world, in Europe, Aſia, and Africke, all of them as before, embracing in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time the holy ſacrifice of Maſſe, and ſacrificinge preiſthood: and an other for Britanie, quite different, and neuer heard of in any antiquitie, neuer practiſed in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forme, or order, neuer regiſtred in any monument. And ſeeing all the Euangeliſts, and Apoſtles of Chriſt, together with their
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:19358:113"/>
diſciples, were maſſinge and ſacrificinge preiſts, and there were no other to preach, and propagate true Religion, in this, or any other nation, vnder heauen, but they, how could any Caluiniſtical communion, or other new deuiſe bee imagined to haue had beeinge here? For whoſoeuer it was, which any proteſtant doth, or will affirme, to haue beene the firſt preacher of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie in this kingdome, S. Peter, S. Paul, or S. Simon Zelotes, who onely among the Apoſtles are reported in hiſtories to haue beene in this kingdome, as our beſt learned proteſtant antiquaries with others truely acknowledge, or S. Ioſeph of Aramathia, for which many contend, or whoſoeuer, if they were preiſts (as preiſts they muſt nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des bee in all opinion Catholicke or Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, that ſhould found our church) they muſt needes alſo be maſſing and ſacrificing preiſts, no other Chriſtian preiſts beeinge in the whole worlde at that time, as before is euident. <hi>Theater of great Britanie lib.</hi> 6. <hi>Camb. in Britan.

                     <p n="2">2. And for thoſe three Apoſtles, I haue particularly proued in euery of them, that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:19358:113"/>
they all, as alſo all the reſt of that holy order of the Apoſtles which diuided the world among them to conuert it to Chriſt, were without any exception, maſſing prei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes. And if any man will perſiſt in S. Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph and his holy company, ſeeing none of theſe were Apoſtles, but directed by them, as all other diſciples either of the 72. or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were at thoſe daies, whoſoeuer among them were preiſts, muſt needs alſo be maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and ſacrificing preiſts, no others being either to conſecrate, or direct them in their holy labours, but thoſe which are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly proued ſuch. And ſeeing wee do not finde in any antiquary Catholicke or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, but S. Ioſephs both conuerſation and direction was either with, or by S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, S. Iohn, S. Iames, or S. Philip, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, all theſe beeing acknowledged to bee maſſinge preiſts, whoſoeuer in S. Ioſephs company were conſecrated, or directed by any of them, could not receaue any other conſecration, or direction.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But to do ſome honor vnto this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, of great Britanie more expreſſely in this kind, though the generally complained of, and lamented amonge antiquaries loſſe
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:19358:114"/>
of our auncient records, and hiſtories of theſe matters, will forbid mee to write ſo fully as I could wiſhe, of this ſubiect, I will ſet downe ſome of the cheifeſt, and firſt maſſinge and ſacrificinge preiſts, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in this nation, and ſhew plainly, how wee had and euer continued, an holy and hierarchicall ſucceſſion of ſuch ſacred par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from S. Peter, that greateſt Apoſtle of Chriſt in all ages, offeringe the bleſſed bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and blood of Chriſt in the ſacrifice of Maſſe, vnto theſe times. So that it ſhall eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeare, although this kingedome hath for ſituation beene called an other world, yet it did neuer from the beginning of Chriſtianitie here, differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the known Catholick Chriſtian world, in theſe holy miſteries, vntill theſe times.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. For the truth and veritie of this firſt plantinge the ſacrificinge Chriſtian preiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and ſacrifice of Maſſe in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, it is little or nothing materiall whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was S. Peter, S. Paul, or S. Simon Zelotes, or S. Ioſeph of Aramathia, or any others, diſciples to any of thoſe, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Apoſtles, becauſe as before is proued, they all agreed in theſe holy thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:19358:114"/>
yet to know who was our firſt founder and Father in Chriſt, to whome wee owe for that the greateſt reuerence, dutiful chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould, and ought to performe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue from him, our happy Hierarchicall ſucceſſion in holy things, and to know the truth which ſome haue veiled and obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to much, it is a thing moſt worthy our knowledge, and our ſhame if wee ſhoulde dwell in ignorance thereof. Therefore to be breife, becauſe it is lately and largely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that S. Peter was this our firſt parent in Chriſt, by all teſtimonies, for this place it will ſuffice, to ſhew how the beſt learned Engliſh Proteſtant antiquaries moſt back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in this buſines, by certaine Maximes or vndoubted grounds in antiquitie, doe conſequently and by an euident neceſſitie, binde themſelues and al others to be of this opinion. <hi>Stowe and Howes hiſtor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. Firſt they ſay the twelue Apoſtles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided the world amongſt them, to conuert it. Secondly, which followeth from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that this kingdome fell in diuiſion to one of theſe Apoſtles· Thirdly, that there is a ſilence in hiſtories, that any Apoſtle, but S. Peter, S. Paul (this none of the twelue)
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:19358:115"/>
and S. Simon Zelotes were here. Fourthly, that this kingdome receaued the faith (if not ſooner) in the beginninge of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Claudius. Fiftly, that in his time many Chriſtians came hither from Rome, and diuers here were in that time conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the faith of Chriſt. Sixtly, that S. Paul came not to Rome, nor any of theſe weſtern parts, while longe after the death of Claudius, in the dayes of Nero, as the ſcripture it ſelfe with all hiſtories is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe therof. Seuenthly, none of them doth affirme, that S. Simon Zelotes was here at all, but if hee were here, they incline to thinke hee came not hither vntill the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge of S. Ioſeph of Aramathia, in the 63. yeare of Chriſt, when in all opinions diuers of this kingedome were Chriſtians allmoſt 20. yeares, and ſome preiſts of this nation very longe before that time.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. From hence an halfe blind man muſt needs make this vndoubted, and infallible concluſion, that S. Peter was our firſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle and Father in Chriſt. Theſe proteſtant antiquaries of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d giue vs further war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant both from themſelues and antiquitie, <hi>that S. Peter did in euery Prouince appoint
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:19358:115"/>
one Archbishop, whom all other Bishops of the ſame Prouince should obey. Peter preached in no place, but hee there ordeyned Bishops and teachers, and founded churches.</hi> And that it is confirmed almoſt 800. yeares ſince by Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon Metaphraſtes (a learned Saint of the Greeke church) out of the Greeke Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and diuers others that S. Peter prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge the word of life in this Iland, hee here founded churches and ordeyned prei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes and deacons. And except S.

Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus our firſt Archbiſhop, were not Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, this great Saint was by theire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance our Archbiſhop in Britanie, and as before ſo conſtituted by S. Peter, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being then to ordeine him to that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in this nation, all which our proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thus write with publick warrant and priuiledge. <hi>Iohn Whitguift answere to the admonition pag.</hi> 65. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. <hi>and def of the answ. pag.</hi> 318. <hi>Clem.

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:19358:135"/>
beene corrected to the common receaued truth, and not corrupted with errors. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly no man that ſaith S.

Thirdly our proteſtants which graunt the church to haue beene free from error longe after the firſt 400. yeares of Chriſt, before which Ruffinus liued, and theſe bookes were corrupted as hee with others teſtifieth, may not bee allowed by their owne Religion, to ſay theſe ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinge and maſſinge doctrines were errors, but truthes of thoſe vnſpotted times. And ſo it is not poſſible that exceptinge ſome thinge tendings to the Eunomians hereſie foiſted into his works by them, any thinge els about theſe matters ſhould be thruſt in; for Ruffinus who, as before was a patron, and practiſer of Maſſe, and ſo teacheth it to haue beene the vniuerſall doctrine, and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:19358:135"/>
practiſe of the church of God, witneſſeth, that whatſoeuer was corrupted in S.

                     <p n="9">9. And to make this matter more ſure, wee haue many and renowned Authors of that, and following times, ſaying clearely, that S.

taught and receaued Religion of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanie in this time: for they produce vnto vs, an old auncient ſermon, written in the latine tonge, and tranſlated into the ſaxon language by Aelfricus in the yeare 996. and to write in proteſtants words, <hi>this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was vſuall to bee read in the church here in England in the yeare</hi> 366. <hi>(Iohn Foxe Act· Monum. pag.</hi> 1142.) which muſt needs bee a moſte excellent teſtimonie for this age &amp; time. And yet amonge many other thinges tendinge to the ſame purpoſe, thus we finde by our proteſtants tranſlation therof. <hi>In the olde lawe faithfull men offered to God diuers ſacrifices, that had fore ſignification of Christs body, which for our ſinnes hee himſelfe to his heauenly Father hath ſince offered to ſacrifice. Certainely this houſell which wee doe now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low at Gods altare, is a remembrance of Christs body, which he offered for vs, and of his blood, which hee shed for vs: So hee himſelfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, doe this in my remembrance. Once ſuffered Christ by himſelfe, but yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe his ſufferinge is daily renevved at this ſupper, through miſtery of the holy houſel.</hi> And againe: <hi>In that holy houſel, there is one thing in it ſeene, and an other vnderstoode. That
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:19358:182"/>
vvhich is there ſeene hath bodily shape: and that vvee doe there vnderſtand, hath ghoſtly might. The houſell is dealed into ſondry parts, chevved betvveene teeth, and ſent into the belly: hovvbeit neuertheleſſe after ghostlie might, it is all in euery part. Many receaue that holy body, and yet notvvithſtandinge, it is ſo all in euery part, after ghostly miſtery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. And ſhewing how the Paſchal Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be was a figure of this holy ſacrifice of Chriſt, the Lambe of Innocency, and God, which taketh away the ſins of the worlde, as in holy Maſſe wee ſo pray vnto Chriſt there preſent, vnder that denomination, they teach it was the vſe and cuſtome of our Chriſtians in Britanie in that time, to doe the ſame, the very words of that olde brittiſh publicke homely by our proteſtants tranſlation bee thus: <hi>That innocent Lambe vvhich the olde Iſraelites did then kill, had ſignification after ghostly vnderſtandinge, of Chriſts ſufferinge, vvho vnguiltie shedd his blood for our redemption. Hereof ſinge Gods ſeruants at euery Maſse, Agnus Dei qui tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis peccata mundi, miſerere nobis</hi>: That is in our ſpeache: Thou Lambe of God, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt away the ſinnes of the worlde, haue

mercie vpon vs. Where wee ſee plainelie acknowledged, by this ſo auncient anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, in this fourth hundred yeare, and the proteſtants themſelues, ſo tranſlatinge and propoſinge it, that generally in that time, the holy ſacrifice of Maſſe was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Biſhops, and preiſts of Britanie in all places, and all the ſeruants of God did then acknowledge, &amp; profeſſe, that Chriſt the true Lambe of God that taketh away the ſinnes of the world was therin offered, and there preſent, prayed vnto by all Gods ſeruants. Which is as much as any maſſing preiſt, Biſhop, or Pope holdeth, teacheth, or practiſeth at this time concerning theſe things.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. And becauſe in this age this our kingedome had by agreement both of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and late writers, and by proteſtants themſelues. (<hi>Bal. l. de ſcriptor. in Palladio &amp; Niniano.</hi>) a greate dependance of Rome, both in temporall and ſpiritual affaires, and many of our cheifeſt cleargie men, as S. Teruanus, and S. Ninianus thoſe two glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Northre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Biſhops, had both their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, inſtruction, ordination, and iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction from thence, as many others had
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:19358:183"/>
at this time, and the Biſhops of Rome are ſo much charged by our proteſtant writers for adding vnto the holy ſacrifice of Maſſe, I will only vſe theſe mens authority, which ſay they will ſet downe what euerie Pope did add, <hi>Quid alij Pontifices addiderint, ſuo loco in Pontificijs actis dicetur.</hi> And they are ſo farr from not performinge their promiſe in this, that they rather relate more then leſſe added by theſe holy Popes, as will bee made euident by theire owne teſtimonies hereafter. Yet for more ample ſatisfaction let vs followe them in this point. Of S. Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſter I haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before, next to him ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded S. Marke, who as theſe men ſay, was Pope in the time of Conſtantine the great, <hi>Conſtantino Imperante in Pontificatu ſedit,</hi> which time was an holy time in Religion, by our Kings iudgement, and ſo this Pope not likely to make any publick lawe vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. Therefore theſe proteſtants onely ſay of him, that hee ordeyned the creede of the Nicen councell to bee ſaid or ſunge at Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe. (<hi>Rob. Barnes in act. Pont. Rom. in Marc.</hi> 1. <hi>Io. Bal. in vit Pont. in eod. Edw. Grimſton. in Marc.</hi>) but this Nicen creed is holy in all iudgements, and was receaued, and vſed in
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:19358:184"/>
Britanie here, in that time, as I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, &amp; it is receaued by the proteſtant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament of England, ſubſcribed and ſworne vnto by all the proteſtant Biſhops and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of England, allowed in the articles of their Religion, and practiſed in theire churches. (<hi>Parlam. an.</hi> 1. <hi>Eliz. K. Iames can. articles of Relig. articl. Creed. commun. booke &amp;c.</hi>) and therefore doth a proteſtant anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarie iuſtly ſay of that holy creed, &amp; time, in the yeare of Chriſt, 330. <hi>At this time the Nicen creed was commaunded to bee ſunge or ſaid, in all Christian churches. (Stowe hist. Rom. ad an.</hi> 330.) therefore none but Arrian Hereticks euer did, or will impugne it.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. The next Pope which theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> finde, to haue added any thinge to this holy ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, was holy Damaſus, an acknowledged good Biſhop, and as they teache, hee onely added the Confiteor, Confeſſion, vſed in the beginninge of Maſſe, in which there is nothinge, which proteſtants diſallowe, but confeſſion and prayer to Saints there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.

<pb n="363" facs="tcp:19358:184"/>
before was vſed in the church of God, and in this Realme of Britanie in the Apoſtles dayes. And to paſſe ouer ſo many examples, and teſtimonies, of other Chriſtian people, and places, in the ſecond age our Apoſtles S. Damianus and Fugatius praied to S. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaell the Archangell, and other Angels, &amp; dedicated a church or chappell to them, the ruines yet ſtandinge neare Glaſtenbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. (<hi>antiquit.

Therefore many our prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants of England confeſſe, that prayer and inuocation of Saints and Angels, was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licklie vſed in the primatiue church, euen in the ſacrifice of Maſſe. And ſome of them make it an article of our creede: for to ſpeak in their wordes. <hi>If wee deny it, wee ſhall peraduenture depriue ourſelues of a great part of their Angels ministery, and diſſolue that communion of Saints, which vvee profeſſe to beleeue as an article of Gods truthe.

Wherefore I may boldly conclude of this holy Pope, in this matter, in theſe words of a Proteſtant Archbiſhop: <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus vvas a good Bishop, and therefore no good thinge by him appointed, to bee diſallovved. (Io. Whitg. ansvv. to the admonit. pag.</hi> 78. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2.3. <hi>and def. of ansvv. pag.</hi> 489. of Pope Siricius they ſay, hee commaunded that

Theſe proteſtants do not mention any other Pope in this age, to haue added, or altered any thinge, in this holy ſacrifice: Therefore by their good leaue I doe here end this fourth hundred of yeares.</p>

                     <p>THe firſt Pope which offereth himſelfe in this next and fifth hundred of yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, to ſpeake as a late proteſtant writer doth, <hi>was Innocent of Albania, or Scotland. (Edw. Grimst. est. of the church of Rome Pope</hi> 41. <hi>pag.</hi> 44. <hi>an. D.</hi> 402.) and commonly it is written of him, both by proteſtants and others. (<hi>Rob. Barnes in vit.

And if hee was of this our Albania, it might be occaſion that the Scots and Britans of this kingdome did more frequent Rome at this, then other times. But whether hee was of Northren Albania, that is in the eaſt, or of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:19358:186"/>
Alba in Italy, or whenceſoeuer, ſure wee are, that many of this nation which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued holy preiſts, and Biſhops alſo, had their education, and inſtruction in Religion, at Rome in theſe dayes, by the maſſing and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificinge preiſts, and Popes in that place. Such were S. Teruanus made Archbiſhop of the Picts, by S. Paladius the Popes Legate in Scotland, about the yeare of Chriſt 432. as our Scottiſh writers teſtifie. And that he was inſtructed in the faith at Rome, I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the ſame Authors, affirming that S. Paladius baptized him, beeing an Infant. <hi>Teruanum Infantem lustrico lauerat fonte Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius.

And ſo hauinge for his Maſter and Tutor in Religion, that maſſinge preiſt, and Biſhop, and the Pope alſo then being the like, this man could not bee inſtructed there in any other Religion, different from that.

<pb n="368" facs="tcp:19358:187"/>
and their diſciples at Rome, was ſent from thence, to teach the ſame and other holie doctrines of Chriſtian faith to the ſame people, and was theire Biſhop, as all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries Catholicke and Proteſtant teſtifie.

Miſſae.</hi>) this prayer, eſpecially the firſt part which hee taxeth, is as auncient in the Maſſe, as the Apoſtles time, and was vſed both by S. Peter and others of that ſacred order: <hi>Miſſam Petrus Antiochiae dicitur cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braſse,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:19358:198"/>
in qua tres tantum orationes in initio fidei proferebantur, incipientes ab eo loco, vbi dicitur; Hanc igitur oblationem.</hi> Therefore S. Leo added nothinge in this prayer, beeing for the firſt part vſed by the Apoſtles, and others in their dayes, which is that, this Proteſtant Biſhop excepteth againſt: and for the later end thereof, which hee taxeth not, was by this man himſelfe, and others, both Catholicks, and Proteſtants, added longe time after, and then, firſt by S. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie the great and firſt Pope of that name. <hi>Baleas l.</hi> 2. <hi>de Act· Pontfic. Rom. in Gregorio</hi> 1. <hi>Rob. Barnes in vit. Pontif.

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. So that it is euident S. Leo neither did, nor could add any part of this prayer, to the ſacrifice of Maſſe as his owne addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or inuention, all that hee did, or poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie could doe therin, was to take order that the decree or cuſtom of the Apoſtles ſhould be obſerued, which cannot be either great or little blaſphemie of God, as this barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous mouth affirmed, but honor vnto God in that behalfe. To make all ſure, I will cite the whole praier then vſed thus in Engliſh: <hi>Therefore ô Lord wee beſeech thee, that thou
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:19358:198"/>
wilt be pleaſed to accept this oblation of our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and all thy family through Christ our Lord.</hi> The reſt being added by S. Gregory, is thus: <hi>and diſpoſe our dayes in peace, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund wee may bee deliuered from euerlasting damnation, and numbred in the flocke of thy elected ſeruants.</hi> In which addition of S Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory there is not any one word, of matter now in controuerſie, but al holy and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, by Proteſtant Religion. And in that part, which I ſay with S. Albin or Alcuine, was vſed by the Apoſtles, there is not one word, except, <hi>oblation,</hi> which is, or can by proteſtants bee called into controuerſie, by them or any Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; Therfore to anſwere that &amp; <hi>hoc ſacrificium, immaculatam hoſtiam,</hi> together; If S. Leo added theſe wordes, to the canon of the Maſſe, then the canon of the Maſſe was before S. Leo his pretended additions: and in other places of this canon of which no proteſtant doth, or will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any Author, beeing as is proued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore apoſtolicall, this Liturgie of Maſſe is called. <hi>(in can.

<pb n="392" facs="tcp:19358:199"/>
a guift, holy ſacrifice vnſpotted, an oblation bleſſed, adſcribed, ratified, reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, a ſacrifice, a pure hoſte, an holy hoſte, an immaculate hoſte.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And this Proteſtant Biſhop himſelfe hath teſtified alſo, that the offertorie was vſed in S. Celeſtines time before: which is this in Engliſh: <hi>O holy Father omnipotent eternall God, receue this immaculate ſacrifice, or oblation, which I thy vnworthie ſeruant doe offer vnto thee, my liuinge and true God, for my innumerable ſinnes, and offences, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligences, and for all here preſent, as alſo for all faithfull Christians both liuinge and deade, that it may bee to mee and them for ſaluation to eternal life.

<pb n="393" facs="tcp:19358:199"/>
from Chriſt, euen with the allowan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of our proteſtants, that Maſſe was an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſacrifice, and all truely conſecrated prei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, did euer in all times and places ſtill of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that moſte holy ſacrifice, both for the liuinge and faithfull departed, and that this was ſo an vndoubted and generally rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued cuſtome, &amp; truth in the whole church, that by our proteſtants graunt, it was iuſtly condemned to bee hereſie, to deny it, and this longe time before S. Leo was borne: Therefore none of thoſe names could bee by any poſſibility his inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this kind. Which this proteſtant accuſing Biſhop him ſelfe to confound and contradict himſelfe, teacheth in the ſame place, when hee ſaith of S. Leo, <hi>Miſſae ſacrificium approbanit.</hi> Hee did approue the ſacrifice of Maſſe: therfore Maſſe was termed and knowne to be ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted a ſacrifice, before his time, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. For a thinge approued, or to bee approued, vnſeparably carrieth with it a precedency to the approbation, that which is, not cannot poſſibly bee approued, as a thinge paſt or preſent, and euery ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance or approbation neceſſarily ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the thinge to bee ſo allowed or appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:19358:200"/>
And this will ſuffice for S. Leo.</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

And Pope Vigilius which liued not longe after Gelaſius, who writinge to the Biſhops of Germany and Fraunce, deſirous to know the order which the church of
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:19358:200"/>
Rome obſerued in the prefaces of Maſſe, anſwereth in this maner. (<hi>Vigilius epistola ad Epiſcopos Germaniae &amp; Galliae.)

And concerninge that of the Apoſtles of matters queſtioned there is onely this clauſe, or petition vnto God, for preſeruing his church: <hi>vt gregem tuum Pastor aeterne non deſeras: ſed per beatos Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolos tuos continua protectione cuſtodias, vt ijſdem Rectortbus gubernetur, quos operis tui Vicarios eidem contuliſti praeſſe Pastores. That God the eternall Pastor will not forſake his flocke, but keepe by his bleſſed Apoſtles, with continuall protection, that it may bee gouerned by the ſame Rulers, whome Vicars of his worke, hee hath appointed Pastors to rule it.</hi> Which is not a prayer immediatlie to the Apoſtles,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:19358:201"/>
but to God for the protection of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and ſuch as our proteſtants themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues in their publick ſeruice, on S.

to bee eſſentiall, and neceſſary in this holy Sacrament, neither follow the one, or other, and ſo by al iudgement, haue depriued them ſelues of lawfull and true Biſhops, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlie of all true cleargie men, which cannot be without true and lawful Biſhops, ſuch as they want, to conſecrate them.</p>

                        <hi>THE XXIII.

                     <p>IN the later end of the fift hundred of yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, of Chriſt, I made relation, how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge many others, thoſe two renowned maſſinge preiſts, S.

                  <p>In which tyme alſo, amonge all thoſe chriſtians which then liued here, thoſe Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops of Scotland, and Walles, who, as our proteſtants tell vs, and commend them for it, did onely or moſt oppoſe againſt the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe, his legates, and authoritie here, were thoſe alſoe, by the ſame proteſtants, which did much more intermeddle in princes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, then any popes, their legats, or ſuch as were moſt obedient vnto, or Ruled by them.

                        <p>The third and laſte generall Rule which theſe men aſſigne vnto vs, is, that mention is not made of any Apoſtle in any antiquitie to haue preached here, but onely of S.

                        <p>Theſe Rules of Proteſtants thus ſuppoſed, and allowed, it will with a ſmall labour, eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeare vnto vs, by theſe men, and all antiquities, that the moſte glorious Apoſtle Saint Peter was our firſt father, and teacher in Chriſt. For firſt concerning S. Paul, hee himſelfe, and other ſcriptures, and theſe proteſtants alſoe confeſſe, hee was none of the 12. Apoſtles, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world was ſoe diuided, and though miraculouſly called by god before, yett not properly an Apoſtle vntill in the 13. chapter of the Acts of the Apoſtles, <hi>v.</hi> 2. hee was ſoe ordeyned:

as our engliſh proteſtants by their conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of the firſt chapter and verſe of S.

I anſwere as before, that wee contend for the firſt Apoſtle, that either immediately by himſelfe, or mediatly by his diſciples, preached here, and founded our church, and not to exclude all Apoſtles in after times, from this kingdome, for I wil at leaſte probably ſhew, that S. Paul was here, a little before his death in an other place; and there alſoe giue his due to S. Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, and his holy company, in a far more honorable degree, then any proteſtant, or other one writer yet to my reading hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed towards them; But S.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19358:263"/>
inuincible argument, that both S.

It hath paſſed with allowance amonge the learned Senate of our Antiquaries, that when Claudius began to banniſh and perſecute the Chriſtians in Rome (which they think to bee before this time of S.

ſaying that S. Ioſophe the ſonne of S. Ioſeph of Aramathia was a Biſhop, as both Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks and Proteſtants allowe them in other things: I craue pardon probably to write, that he was one of them which S. Peter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated here.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, becauſe as is graunted, before S. Ariſtobulus our Archbiſhop, vnto whom S. Ioſeph, whether Biſhop or noe, was ſubiect, was ordeyned by S. Peter. Secondly becauſe S.

                        <p>Secondlie there is noe poſſibilitie by any authoritie, that I finde at all, to ſurmiſe that S.

of the Pope of Rome by his legats here.

                        <p>ANd becauſe there is greate difference betweene Catholicks and Proteſtants, concerninge ſome priuiledges which the former commonly yeeld, and the ſecond as vſually in England denye vnto him, and eyther of them would bee thought to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and embrace the opinion, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of that bleſſed Pope Eleutherius, and thoſe vnſpotted times, eſpecially as they are interpreted by themſelues, lett vs now take counſaile and aduiſe of theſe Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts their perſecutors in this kinde, whether this moſte bleſſed Pope Eleutherius,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:19358:295"/>
whoe ſoe conuerted this nation, and was ſoe bleſſed, and worthie a Saint with theſe men, was not by their Iudgements, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, as far ingaged in this matter, as Pope Gregorie, the fifteenth of that name, now is; or Kinge Lucius that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kinge and Saint, the holy Biſhops, and cleargie, and all the Chriſtians of this land, at that tyme did not giue to the Popes of Rome then, as much in this kinde, as anie Engliſh preiſt, or Catholicke now doth, and by the preſent Roman Religion may giue, and allowe to this preſent Pope, or any other.</p>
                        <p>This is euidently proued, and inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly made manifeſt vnto vs before, not onely by ſoe many our beſt Antiquities, but generallie by the beſt learned Engliſh Proteſtant hiſtorians, iointly and with an vniforme conſent, agreeing in this, that at the ſettlinge of manie Archbiſhops, and Biſhops in this Iland, by the higheſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall power of Saint Eleutherius, by the ſame alſoe the whole kingedome of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, with the Northern Ilands, were made ſubiect to the Archbiſhopp of Yorke, in ſpirituall thinges, as I haue proued before
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:19358:296"/>
by the beſt hiſtorians, Catholicks &amp; Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants which haue written of this matter. Which alſoe agree, that theſe kingedomes were at that time, longe before, and vntill the vnion of them by our preſent Soueraigne kinge Iames, not onely diſtinct, and diuers kingedomes, vnder diuers kinges, lawes, and gouernments, but ordinarily, as then they were, at open warres, and hoſtilitie in ciuill and temporall reſpects; Therfore it was neyther Kinge Lucius, whoe to vſe the words of Hector Boethius. (<hi>Scator. hiſtor. l.</hi> 5 <hi>fol.</hi> 83. <hi>Godwyn conuerſ. of Britanie pag.</hi> 22.23) aggreing with our Engliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and others in this, <hi>was but a kinge by curteſie of the Romane Emperors and their Authoritie. Lucius Britonibus Caeſaris bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolentia &amp; authoritate imperitabat.</hi> Therefore hee neyther had, nor poſſibly could haue his power, and principalitie extended further, then that of the Romans was, which went noe further then the wall of Adrian, which diuided the kingedomes, makinge Scotland a diſtinct kingedome, and neuer ſubiect to the Roman Emperors. Which could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe to kinge Lucius more, then they were Lords and Maſters of themſelues, for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:19358:296"/>
to that lawe maxime, vſed by manie Proteſtants, and a grownde in the lawe, and light of nature it ſelfe; <hi>Nemo poteſt plus Iuris in alium transferre, quàm ipſe habet</hi>: Noe man can giue more power to another, then hee himſelfe hath. For ſoe hee ſhould giue that which hee hath noe right or power to giue, beeinge a thinge vnpoſſible.</p>
                        <p>Therefore kinge Lucius, nor the Roman Emperors, hauinge any power, or right at all ſpirituall, or temporall, ouer the Scots or Britans, or any people then dwellinge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that Wall, in the kingedome now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Scotland, they could not by any poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie giue ſuch ſpirituall power, to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Yorke to commaund in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, nor commaund the inhabitants of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in noe reſpect ſubiect vnto them, to bee ſubiect to the Biſhop of Yorke, their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect in temporall reſpects. Neither did, would or could the kings of Scotland, then pagans ſubiect, and ſubmitt their people and contry to the Archbiſhop of yorke of an other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, now enemy to them, both in ſpirituall and temporall reſpects. And it is directly againſt all Proteſtants profeſſions, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or churches, that any Proteſtant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19358:297"/>
or other whoſoeuer clayminge or preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſupreame ſpirituall Iuriſdiction among them, ſhould challendge or preſume to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it further, then their temporall ditions and Gouernments, as is euident in all places where the new Religion is admitted, as En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, the Lowe contries, the cantons of Switſerland and the reſt, where the ſpirituall Iuriſdiction which they claime, is limited and confined within the circuites of their temporall Dominions, without any further progreſſe. <hi>Parlam.</hi> 1. <hi>Elizab.</hi> 1. <hi>Iacob.

                        <p>Therefore this higheſt ſupreame directing ſpirituall power (which eſtabliſhed at that time, and longe after, the ſubordination and ſubiection of Scotland and the Ilands to the Archbiſhop of Yorke) muſt needs by theſe Proteſtants, and all Antiquities, bee onely peculiar to the Pope of Rome, whoe and that alone effected theſe things: as ſoe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Proteſtants and others haue proued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and others from our beſt antiquities af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that all eccleſiaſticall thinges were ordered here, <hi>according to the commaundment of Pope Eleutherius that bleſſed man.

Which is an euident demonſtration, that this holy Pope had this ſupreame ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power ouer all this Iland at that time; for without ſuch a power, theſe things could not haue beene performed. And demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth alſoe, that noe other power on earth, could haue duely performed it, eſpecially any temporall Kinge, Prince, Emperour or Lieutenant whatſoeuer, for ſoe, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the names, offices, and powers of ſuch Rulers, they ſhould bee Emperors, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Rulers, Regents and the like where they haue noe Empire, Kingedome, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, Regiment, ſoueraigntie or any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, a thinge in the light of nature of it ſelfe, imployinge contradiction, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
                        <p>And lett noe man ſay, that accordinge vnto ſome, as namely Giraldus Cambren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, this Iland was diuided into fiue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, Britannia prima, Britannia ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunda, Flauia, Maxima, and Valentia, which now is Scotland, and that there was an Archbiſhop there.

For I anſweare, this diuiſion was made longe after this, as the twoe laſte prouinces Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia &amp; Valentia proue in their owne names.

                        <p>Therefore it is a very idle and ignorant coniecture, or rather malitious error of ſome Proteſtants, to ſeeme to write as though Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany had receaued the faith fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome of the Aſiatical churches, becauſe ſome of the later Scots and Britans die erre in that obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

                        <p>By which, and that which is ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this chapter, it is euident, that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland this part of Britanie then had both Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and Archbiſhops continuinge in the ſame order and maner as they were firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted here by the See of Rome: neither did they now begin to depart or ſeperate themſelues from obedience to that See Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicke; for ſoone after this, the firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral councel of Nice beeinge called, theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts haue told vs, wee had Biſhops there, and moſt euident it is, that it was receaued in this kingdome.

In the time of the Nicen councell, &amp; before, as appeareth by the Acts of the councell limitinge their bounds, there were three principall Biſhops, or Patriarkes of the chriſtian church: namely the Biſhop of Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch.

The words of theſe Proteſtants Whitgift and Foxe are theſe. (<hi>Whitgift Def. pag.</hi> 331. <hi>Foxe tom.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 12.)
<q>The councell of Nice which was the yeare of our Lord 340. and in the ſixt canon of the ſaid coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell wee finde it ſoe decreed, that in euery prouince, or precinct ſome one church or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of the ſame, was appointed and ſett vp, to haue the Inſpection and Regiment of other churches about him, <hi>ſecundum morem antiquum,</hi> that is after the auncient cuſtome, as the words of the councell doe purport.</q>

Therefore wee muſt now ſeeke to the other two Archiepiſcopall Sees, Caerlegion and Yorke. For S. Dubricius, hee was both conſecrated by the Popes Legate, S. Germanus, and hee himſelfe alſoe both the Popes Legate, <hi>and Primate of all Britanie. Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanniae Primas, &amp; Apostolicae ſedis Legatus. (Galfrid. Monum. hiſt. Reg.

Therefore there cannot bee the leaſt ſuſpition, but that, both hee, and the prouinces both of the North of England, and Scotland alſoe, then vnder his iuriſdiction, were of the ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in this matter. And if the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan See of London a little before deſtroyed, as our hiſtories tell vs. (<hi>Galfrid. mon. hiſtor. Reg.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:19358:348"/>
crowned kings by theſe holy Archbiſhops, Legats, patrons and knowne mainteyners of the priuiledges of the Apoſtolicke See of Rome. Kinge Vortimer belonged to the age before, therefore I onely here ſay of him, as I am directed by our Proteſtants in the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhe hiſtorie, as they approue it. (<hi>Galfrid.

                           <pb n="209" facs="tcp:19358:349"/>
All agree that for betraying the country to the Infidels, and his other moſte horrible ſinnes, hee was iuſtly and greeuouſly puniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed by God, and died miſerably with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall infamie: and the others were renowned patrons and obedient children to the church of God, which had aduaunced them, to the regall dignitie. <hi>Matth.
