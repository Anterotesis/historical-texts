            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>And the more plainely to demon≈øtrate this, when I come to the fir≈øt plantinge of the faith of Christ, in this kingdome in the Apostles time, I will make manifest, by all testimonies, and antiquities, that Chri≈øt our ble≈øsed Sauiour and Me≈øsias accordingly to the prophe≈øies of him did in≈øtitute this ≈øacrificing priesthood, and both celebrated, and ordeined the ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Ma≈øse for his Church for euer.

                  <p>And hereby it will ≈øufficiently appeare, vnto all protestants, and per≈øecutors of the holy Catholike Romane Church, that ≈øeeing the controuer≈øie is, whether the Catholike, or protestant church is the

and S.

And to put vs out of all doubt or que≈øtion that this is and was theire meaninge in tho≈øe holy ≈øcriptures, I will proue, that euery one of them was a true ma≈ø≈øinge prei≈øt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually did offer, and celebrate the mo≈øt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable ≈øacrifice of Ma≈ø≈øe, in e≈ø≈øential thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as the holy Catholicke ma≈ø≈øing prei≈øts of the church of Rome now doe, and haue euer mo≈øt religiou≈øly done, in all ages. The ≈øame I will likewi≈øe proue, of all the other Apo≈øtles, in their order, onely I will craue leaue of S.

≈øaying that S. Io≈øophe the ≈øonne of S. Io≈øeph of Aramathia was a Bi≈øhop, as both Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks and Prote≈øtants allowe them in other things: I craue pardon probably to write, that he was one of them which S. Peter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecrated here.</p>

                        <p>ANd becau≈øe there is greate difference betweene Catholicks and Prote≈øtants, concerninge ≈øome priuiledges which the former commonly yeeld, and the ≈øecond as v≈øually in England denye vnto him, and eyther of them would bee thought to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and embrace the opinion, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øe of that ble≈ø≈øed Pope Eleutherius, and tho≈øe vn≈øpotted times, e≈øpecially as they are interpreted by them≈øelues, lett vs now take coun≈øaile and adui≈øe of the≈øe Prote≈øta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ts their per≈øecutors in this kinde, whether this mo≈øte ble≈ø≈øed Pope Eleutherius,

whoe ≈øoe conuerted this nation, and was ≈øoe ble≈ø≈øed, and worthie a Saint with the≈øe men, was not by their Iudgements, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtimonies, as far ingaged in this matter, as Pope Gregorie, the fifteenth of that name, now is; or Kinge Lucius that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kinge and Saint, the holy Bi≈øhops, and cleargie, and all the Chri≈øtians of this land, at that tyme did not giue to the Popes of Rome then, as much in this kinde, as anie Engli≈øh prei≈øt, or Catholicke now doth, and by the pre≈øent Roman Religion may giue, and allowe to this pre≈øent Pope, or any other.</p>
                        <p>This is euidently proued, and inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly made manife≈øt vnto vs before, not onely by ≈øoe many our be≈øt Antiquities, but generallie by the be≈øt learned Engli≈øh Prote≈øtant hi≈øtorians, iointly and with an vniforme con≈øent, agreeing in this, that at the ≈øettlinge of manie Archbi≈øhops, and Bi≈øhops in this Iland, by the highe≈øt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall power of Saint Eleutherius, by the ≈øame al≈øoe the whole kingedome of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, with the Northern Ilands, were made ≈øubiect to the Archbi≈øhopp of Yorke, in ≈øpirituall thinges, as I haue proued before
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:19358:296"/>
by the be≈øt hi≈øtorians, Catholicks &amp; Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtants which haue written of this matter. Which al≈øoe agree, that the≈øe kingedomes were at that time, longe before, and vntill the vnion of them by our pre≈øent Soueraigne kinge Iames, not onely di≈øtinct, and diuers kingedomes, vnder diuers kinges, lawes, and gouernments, but ordinarily, as then they were, at open warres, and ho≈øtilitie in ciuill and temporall re≈øpects; Therfore it was neyther Kinge Lucius, whoe to v≈øe the words of Hector Boethius. (<hi>Scator. hi≈øtor. l.</hi> 5 <hi>fol.</hi> 83. <hi>Godwyn conuer≈ø. of Britanie pag.</hi> 22.23) aggreing with our Engli≈øh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtants, and others in this, <hi>was but a kinge by curte≈øie of the Romane Emperors and their Authoritie. Lucius Britonibus Cae≈øaris bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolentia &amp; authoritate imperitabat.</hi> Therefore hee neyther had, nor po≈ø≈øibly could haue his power, and principalitie extended further, then that of the Romans was, which went noe further then the wall of Adrian, which diuided the kingedomes, makinge Scotland a di≈øtinct kingedome, and neuer ≈øubiect to the Roman Emperors. Which could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe to kinge Lucius more, then they were Lords and Ma≈øters of them≈øelues, for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:19358:296"/>
to that lawe maxime, v≈øed by manie Prote≈øtants, and a grownde in the lawe, and light of nature it ≈øelfe; <hi>Nemo pote≈øt plus Iuris in alium transferre, qu√†m ip≈øe habet</hi>: Noe man can giue more power to another, then hee him≈øelfe hath. For ≈øoe hee ≈øhould giue that which hee hath noe right or power to giue, beeinge a thinge vnpo≈ø≈øible.</p>
                        <p>Therefore kinge Lucius, nor the Roman Emperors, hauinge any power, or right at all ≈øpirituall, or temporall, ouer the Scots or Britans, or any people then dwellinge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that Wall, in the kingedome now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Scotland, they could not by any po≈ø≈øibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie giue ≈øuch ≈øpirituall power, to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi≈øhop of Yorke to commaund in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, nor commaund the inhabitants of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in noe re≈øpect ≈øubiect vnto them, to bee ≈øubiect to the Bi≈øhop of Yorke, their ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect in temporall re≈øpects. Neither did, would or could the kings of Scotland, then pagans ≈øubiect, and ≈øubmitt their people and contry to the Archbi≈øhop of yorke of an other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, now enemy to them, both in ≈øpirituall and temporall re≈øpects. And it is directly again≈øt all Prote≈øtants profe≈ø≈øions, confe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions, or churches, that any Prote≈øtant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce

or other who≈øoeuer clayminge or preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ≈øupreame ≈øpirituall Iuri≈ødiction among them, ≈øhould challendge or pre≈øume to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it further, then their temporall ditions and Gouernments, as is euident in all places where the new Religion is admitted, as En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, the Lowe contries, the cantons of Swit≈øerland and the re≈øt, where the ≈øpirituall Iuri≈ødiction which they claime, is limited and confined within the circuites of their temporall Dominions, without any further progre≈ø≈øe. <hi>Parlam.</hi> 1. <hi>Elizab.</hi> 1. <hi>Iacob.

                        <p>Therefore this highe≈øt ≈øupreame directing ≈øpirituall power (which e≈øtabli≈øhed at that time, and longe after, the ≈øubordination and ≈øubiection of Scotland and the Ilands to the Archbi≈øhop of Yorke) mu≈øt needs by the≈øe Prote≈øtants, and all Antiquities, bee onely peculiar to the Pope of Rome, whoe and that alone effected the≈øe things: as ≈øoe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Prote≈øtants and others haue proued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and others from our be≈øt antiquities af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that all eccle≈øia≈øticall thinges were ordered here, <hi>according to the commaundment of Pope Eleutherius that ble≈ø≈øed man.

Which is an euident demon≈øtration, that this holy Pope had this ≈øupreame ≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall power ouer all this Iland at that time; for without ≈øuch a power, the≈øe things could not haue beene performed.
