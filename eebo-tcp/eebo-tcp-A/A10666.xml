            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>Then of the towne, our last farewell we tooke,</l>
                  <l>With thundring noise, that seem'd t'affright the ayre,</l>
                  <l>Whilst Ladies from, the shoares on vs did looke,</l>
                  <l>With wo-swolne eyes, that we had left them there:</l>
                  <l>They shooke their hands, and shed teares for our sake,</l>
                  <l>In hope for them, our ships we would turne back.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Their sighes they sent, ouer the billowes rough,</l>
                  <l>Brought to our ships, with <hi>Zephyrus</hi> gentle hisses,</l>
                  <l>And when they saw, we knew it well inough,</l>
                  <l>With balmie breath, they blew to vs their kisses:</l>
                  <l>Their gloues they tooke, and in the water fling them,</l>
                  <l>Hoping the tide, vnto our ships would bring them.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But <hi>Eolus</hi> which, our friend did still remaine,</l>
                  <l>Hasted our ships, from off that forreine coast,</l>
                  <l>Fearing least that, we should turne back againe,</l>
                  <l>And so our paines, were altogether lost:</l>
                  <l>For why? he knew, their <hi>Syren-</hi>tempting-songs,</l>
                  <l>Might well pretend, vnto our further wrongs.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Wherefore no leaue, he gaue vs to dispense,</l>
                  <l>But liuely gales, he whisled in our shrowdes,</l>
                  <l>So that he soone, conuei'd our Nauie thence,</l>
                  <l>Rowling amidst, the all vntamed flouds:</l>
                  <l>And by the power, of his great swaying hand,</l>
                  <l>W'are driuen from ken, of that delightfull land.</l>

                  <l>To beate and bandy, was their onely sport,</l>
                  <l>Vntill a set game, they agreed to make:</l>
                  <l>Yet like young boyes, they did dallying play,</l>

                  <l>The surges seem'd, their boystrous hands to clap:</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Triton</hi> did sound, in most harmonious wise,</l>
                  <l>Whilest <hi>Neptune</hi> gazed, on our welthy prise.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Who seem'd to call, <hi>Apollo</hi> from his chaire,</l>

                  <l>Which seemes to come, from out the Phrigian aire,</l>
                  <l>Where wee with store, and treasure once did meete,</l>
                  <l>The firme foundation, of faire <hi>Troye</hi> to laye:</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Had these Grecians, which as I suppose,</l>
                  <l>Falsly betray'd, that vnremouing towne,</l>

                  <l>In watry deserts, vnder my spatious crowne:</l>
                  <l>But if I knew, that these were surely they,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>At whose sterne words, <hi>Apollo</hi> seem'd to speake:</l>

                  <l>These are our friends, the which no peace will breake,</l>
                  <l>These men haue beene, to fetch Promethean fire:</l>
                  <l>These men are they, that trauells for our good,</l>

                  <l>Then vse them gently, as our chiefest friends,</l>

                  <l>They shall haue fame, but we shall haue the gaine.</l>

                  <l>Then <hi>Neptune</hi> seem'd, to calme his rugged brow,</l>

                  <l>(While that our Theams, the frothie brine did plow)</l>
                  <l>He held a parle, in his spatious hall:</l>
                  <l>All stormie windes, he chast from out his land,</l>
                  <l>Onely faire <hi>Zephyr,</hi> at his beck did stand.</l>

                  <l>
                     <hi>Neptune</hi> himselfe, did waite vpon our fleete,</l>
                  <l>And when the wind, feared displeasure quaild,</l>
                  <l>Then would he helpe vs, with a tide most sweet:</l>
