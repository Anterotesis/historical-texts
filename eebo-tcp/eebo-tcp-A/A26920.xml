            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have lately perused your judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Treatise called <hi>The Real Christian,</hi> in which you seek to deliver the Church from the danger of the Errors of Mr. <hi>Daniel Rogers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> Mr. <hi>Shephard,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi>; (And I think Mr. <hi>Shephard</hi>'s <hi>Sound Believer</hi> needeth more Medication to make it sound, than you have yet used.) Among the rest, I find you have endeavoured in the End, to save the Church also from the <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>danger</hi> of my Directions for <hi>Heavenly Meditation</hi> in my <hi>Saints Rest.</hi> And though my own opinion be, that seeing we have formerly had some converse by Writing, it would have been better to have attempted to convince me by Letters, of my Errors, before you had
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59344:3"/>
warned the World to take heed of them, that you might have heard first what I had to say for my self; yet I confess those are punctilio's, not to be stood upon in this age; in which no great exactness of foresight, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or justice is to be expected: Nor have I a desire to abridge you of your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of speaking as publikely as you have a list. But taking your writings as I find them, I shall take the boldness to tell you, I. How far my judgement doth concurr with yours, which shall be answered by my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours: II. How farr I am unsatisfied in your Writings on this point.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am glad, 1. That you are tender of the peace of troubled tender Christians, and would have Ministers take heed lest they should break the bruised reed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I am glad that you would have Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters accurate in their words and writings, and not by heedless unwarrantable expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wrong the Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I am glad that you are sensible that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams are to be avoided, and that over-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in doctrines of piety, and pretending to go beyond the Church of God, even farther than God would have us, is one way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring truth and piety.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I am glad that you are for keeping close to that rule of Truth and duty, and against making a Religion, or any part of it to our selves.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59344:3"/>5. I am glad that you are for a free and faithful opening and disowning the Errors and failings of the most esteemed Divines; that weak Christians may not be injured by the reverence of their names. And that you are not of the pernicious opinion of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Professours of Religiousness in this age, who think that none of their faults or weaknesses should be opened, lest it give matter to their Adversaries to reproach them; and that all that is said against <hi>them,</hi> is said against <hi>Religion</hi>; and that to call them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, is to disgrace Religion, and to strengthen the hands of wickedness. I am glad that you see the horrid blindness and wickedness of this conceit; and how odious a thing it is to preferr our selfish personal reputation, before the honour of Christ and true Religion; or else to think that it is an honour to Christ and Religion to justifie our sins. I am glad that you have the wisdome of a Christian, rather to disown the Errors of the Godlyest Divines, than to leave it to angry contentious Adversaries to open them in another manner, and to other ends and uses: And that you think not as our selfish blind ones do, that we may dance naked unseen and undisgraced, if we are but in the net of self-flattery; and that angry Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will see none of our errours or faults, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we tell them of them by our Repentance. In all this, you and I are of a mind.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59344:4"/>6. And in particular, I am afraid as well as you of screwing weak ones too high in this duty of <hi>meditation</hi> on the <hi>Glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And therefore lest I should injure the weak, or any others, 1. In the Book it self (The <hi>Saints Rest</hi>) I have given the Reader these warnings, Pag. 703. Ed. 9. [<hi>Yet be cautious in understanding this. I know this will not prove every mans duty: some have not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their time at command; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot set their hours: such are most ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and many Children of poor and carnal Parents; and many are so poor that the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of their families will deny them this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. I do not think it the duty of such, to leave their labours for this work, just at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain set times; no nor for prayer or other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary worship. No such duty, is a duty at all times: Affirmatives bind not</hi> semper &amp; ad sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. <hi>When two duties come together, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not both be performed, it were then a sin to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the lesser. Of two duties we must choose the greater</hi> (i. e. consideratis considerandis) <hi>though of two sins we must choose neither. I think such persons were best to be watchful, to redeem time as much as they can, and take their vacant opportunities as they fall; and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to joyne Meditation and Prayer as much as they can with the very labours of their Callings. There is no such enmity between labouring and Meditating, or Praying in the Spirit, but that both may conveniently be done together.</hi> Yet I
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59344:4"/>
say, <hi>as</hi> Paul <hi>in another case, If thou canst be free, use it rather. Those that have more spare time from worldly necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ries, and are Masters to dispose of themselves and their time,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And pag. 704, [<hi>Just how oft it should be, I cannot determine, because mens several condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may vary it: But in general, That it be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, the Scripture requireth, when it menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth meditating continually, or day and night,</hi> Psal. 1.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 119.97. <hi>&amp;</hi> 148.19. <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of our conditions may much vary the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of our duty. It may be one mans duty to hear, or pray ofter than another; and so it may be in this of Meditation: But for those that can conveniently omit other business, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise that it be once a day at least:</hi> So also pag. 707. <hi>&amp;</hi> 709.</p>
            <p>And being afraid lest I should injure una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble persons, in many books since, I have over and over (lest it should be overlookt) repeated (I feared <hi>ad nauseam Lectoris</hi>) these Cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ions; As <hi>Method for Peace of Consc.</hi> p. 12. [<hi>studying and serious meditating be not duties for the deeply Melancholy— You must let those alone till you are better able to perform them, lest by attempting those duties which you cannot perform, you utterly disable your self from all, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I thus conclude my Treat. of <hi>The Divine Life, [But now I have given you these few Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for the improvement of your solitude for converse with God, lest I should occasion the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59344:5"/>
hurt of those that are unfit for the Lesson I have given, I must conclude with this caution which I have formerly also published: that it is not Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy or Weak headed persons who are not able to bear such exercises, for whom I have written these Directions. Those that are not able to be much in serious solitary thoughtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, without confusions and distracting suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and hurrying vexations thoughts, must set themselves for the most part to those duties, which are to be done in company by the help of others; and must be very little in solitary duties; For to them whose natural faculties are so diseased and weak it is no duty; as being no means to do them the desired good: But while they strive to do that which they are naturally unable to endure, they will but confound and distract themselves, and make themselves unable for those other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which yet they are not utterly unfit for: To such persons therefore instead of ordered, well digested Meditations, and much time spent in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thoughtfulness, it must suffice that they be brief in secret prayer; and take up with such occasional abrupter Meditations, as they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, and that they be the more in reading, hearing, conference, Praying, and praising God with others,</hi> &amp;c.] More such I omit.</p>
            <p>I now add more particularly (lest I should injure any.) 1. That I take it not to be the duty of a Minister to leave his necessary Study, Preaching, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for this set Meditation: 2. Nor for a Magistrate to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59344:5"/>
leave his necessary work of Government for it. 3. Nor for any man in an Active life, to leave a necessary duty of his place for it: 4. Nor for any weak persons to stretch their braines beyond their abilitie, to do what they cannot do. Greatest Duties must be preferred, and men must endeavour prudently according to their capacity and power. And God will have mercy and not sacrifice and would not have Religion crack our braines, nor turn out our duties towards men, or of our particular Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>But for all this I am of the same mind expressed in the Book which you find fault with. 1. That <hi>Heavenly mindedness is essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to Holiness.</hi> 2. That <hi>Heavenly thoughts</hi> or <hi>Meditations,</hi> are much of the <hi>exercise</hi> of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly mindedness.</hi> 3. And that it is every mans duty to exercise his Thoughts or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations in the most <hi>clear, methodical, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting, practical</hi> way that his <hi>Abilities</hi> and <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities (consideratis considerandis) will</hi> reach to. For which useful Method I gave the best directions I could. But I will not justifie my weakness, nor deny that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the Church of God, nor deny the preheminence of my Brethrens understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nor the greater usefulness of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. And it is not unlikely that mine may have more faults that I discern, which are soon discerned by more judicious men;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59344:6"/>
for whose correction I would not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful.</p>
            <p n="2">II. And now I sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll tell you wherein I differ from you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It seemeth to me unrighteous dealing, when you undertake in Print to save Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians from my Errours, to overpass all the limitations before recited which I gave them; and to carry it as if I had made that <hi>Manner</hi> which you except against, to be <hi>all mens,</hi> or <hi>most mens duty.</hi> Yea not only by your preterition of <hi>my words,</hi> but by <hi>your own,</hi> to perswade the Reader that so indeed it was: When you say, pag. 314. [<hi>This I see is the Meditation strongly urged, upon Christians: A duty very hard I am sure; And if our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation lie upon this being performed after this manner as this learned and Reverend Author hath set down, then most Christians that I meet with, forty to one, and those whom I esteem good Christians, must never come at Heaven, but must to that dark place.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Did you not intimate in these words, that I make it as necessary to salvation as these words import? If so, Truth and Candor should have prevailed with you, to have left out all such passages. You see I make it not so much as a <hi>duty</hi> to any that have not <hi>ability</hi> and <hi>conveniency:</hi> much less that the <hi>mode</hi> is of <hi>necessity</hi> to <hi>salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet I must add, that our <hi>Salvation</hi> is not <hi>unconcerned</hi> in <hi>any</hi> of our <hi>duties,</hi> though I
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59344:6"/>
will not say that our <hi>salvation lyeth on it, so as</hi> we <hi>must else</hi> be damned.</p>
            <p>What if I had given you a scheme of the admirably accurate <hi>Method</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> which is found in the <hi>Lords Prayer?</hi> I would have said that the observation of this <hi>Method</hi> is a <hi>Duty</hi>; and that our salvation is not <hi>unconcerned</hi> in that duty; I would have said that all men should do their best to come up to that accurate Method in their Prayers; But so, as not to crack their brains, nor hinder them in the <hi>Matter,</hi> nor neglect any <hi>greater duty,</hi> to do <hi>this</hi>; But with <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, just</hi> endeavours, according to their <hi>abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>opportunities.</hi> I would not have said that their salvation so lyeth on it, that none that use not this method can be saved; nor would I be so <hi>rough</hi> and <hi>curst,</hi> (as you speak) to those that cannot use this Method, as to deprive them of their comfort: But I would tell them what is their Rule and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern.

have given you more Reverent language: though I had thought never the better of the Question: nor do I think sure that you can judge it ever the less a duty, because your Father used it not (which yet I think you were not obliged to have so far told the world.)

            <p n="1">1. To prove <hi>Meditation</hi> or <hi>frequent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation day and night</hi> a duty, is needless; You confess it. 2.

the <hi>Verity</hi> of <hi>Judgement</hi> and <hi>Speech</hi> lyeth in their <hi>Congruity to things</hi>] are points known by the Light of Reason, and you should not call for a Text to prove them. The Light of nature is not contemptible: The Law of Nature is Gods Law. If Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Preaching is the expressing of those thoughts to others, which by meditation we exercise for our selves. Therefore if it may be known what is <hi>Orderly Preaching,</hi> by the agreeableness of the <hi>expressions</hi> to the <hi>matter</hi> in order to the true <hi>End,</hi> then so it may be in <hi>Meditation,</hi> which is a Preaching to our selves.

            <p>The Major is found in Nature and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: The Minor is a naturally-known truth, exemplified throughout the Scripture, which is written in that Method (and in all Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical writings) And yet must you have a Text for the Conclusion?</p>
            <p>As for Family Prayer I have by me a long Disputation which I think fully proveth it to be a duty; and to most Christian families twice a day. But if the <hi>Law of nature</hi> must make up neither <hi>Major</hi> nor <hi>Minor,</hi> but you must have the <hi>Conclusion</hi> in express Texts of Scripture, its like if you saw it, you would not be satisfied with it: But it satisfyeth me, as very full proof. But so that there also I believe not that there are no exceptions: Or that no family may have business so ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent as to exempt them from this as a duty; or that all families are bound t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the same hours, or the same proportion of time.</p>
            <p>I will not tell you that it is <hi>ridiculous</hi> to ask what Text of Scripture maketh it a mans duty, to give meat to his family twice a day: (with the other instances which I laid down.) But if those <hi>ridicula capita</hi> that then thus pleaded against family Prayer did ask me the same question again, I would tell <hi>them</hi> so.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59344:9"/>
And I would think this argument might prove a Divine obligation.</p>
            <p>[<hi>God requireth us to give food to our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies (if we are able and have opportunity) as oft as is for the benefit or necessity of their natures. But it is for the benefit and necessity of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to have food twice a day, (ordinarily, and as to most persons:) Therefore God requireth us to give food, to most families, and ordinarily, twice a day.</hi> Or suppose I put in but <hi>once</hi> at least, if you think I cannot prove the <hi>twice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not now determining whether <hi>fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> prayer</hi> must be as oft, but whether this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing be faulty for want of a Conclusion in the words of a Text of Scripture. I think that Scripture is so admirably suited to the <hi>Nature</hi> of things, that the farr greatest part of its precepts are found also in the true Law of nature; And that even most of the <hi>Gospel precepts</hi> may be called, (supposing the <hi>History and Doctrine) Lex naturae lapsae reparandae, a Law suited to Natures repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. But I am utterly ignorant of your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when you say, that <hi>they that can Meditate thus ten hours,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are the happier men, and have great cause to bless God for such a mercy.</hi> Either you take it to be a <hi>Duty</hi> to such men (to any men) or no duty: If you take it to be their (or any mens) duty, then 1. You would not call for a Text of Scripture to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59344:9"/>
prove it a duty. 2. Nor you would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to differ from me; For I know your Candour abhorreth calumny; And therefore (notwithstanding your forementioned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsome intimations) I suppose it is none of your purpose to perswade your Reader that I make it a duty <hi>for all men,</hi> and you only for <hi>some?</hi> For as your <hi>Piety</hi> and your <hi>friendship</hi> satisfie me that you have no such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, so I know you would discern it to be against the interest of your <hi>own reputation,</hi> which would suffer when the contrary is seen in my writings. Therefore I cannot understand whether you take it to be <hi>any mans</hi> duty.</p>
            <p>And if not, then you seem to hold the Popish doctrine of <hi>Evangelical Councils</hi> of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> and of <hi>works</hi> of <hi>supererrogation</hi> or <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> which are <hi>no duties.</hi> Which yet I will not believe you hold, till I needs must: And therefore having no third exposition of your words, I must leave them all as unintelligible to me.</p>
            <p>If you should say that my Limitations are not in the same Book (the <hi>Saints Rest)</hi> where the Duty is described, I should answer, 1. That is not so; They are in the same. 2. He that confuteth a man twenty years after his Writings are published, is obliged to take notice of what he hath written since: Else if a man reform or correct his own Writings it will signifie nothing; but others are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59344:10"/>
to do it still, as supposing it undone. 3. And this Book of yours is not in the same Volume as my supposed Errour is: Therefore if my <hi>own</hi> will not serve turn, because they are not the same Book, neither will yours.</p>
            <p>Or may I doubt lest you did for want of leisure, confound the several parts of my Writing? And take that which I wrote of the common necessity of a Heavenly mind, or of Meditation of Heaven, to be written also to prove or urge the same necessity of the <hi>Length or Method?</hi> No; I must not be so inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to you; For though you are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to read my writings till you <hi>understand</hi> them; yet I know you cannot forget that you are obliged to <hi>understand them,</hi> if they are intelligible, before you <hi>deliberately oppose</hi> them. Therefore I have no way left but to conclude, that you are not intelligible to me.</p>
            <p n="5">5. What I have said all this while of the <hi>Method,</hi> I say also of the <hi>Time</hi> of <hi>Meditation,</hi> which is part of your exception.</p>
            <p>It is a duty to spend so much Time in Meditation as is best to Edification to attain its End. But to them that have Ability and opportunity, at least a quarter or half an hour, if not more, is best to Edification to attain the End. Therefore to such it is a duty to spend so much time herein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:59344:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>I will give you no Text of Scripture for the Conclusion, nor for the Minor. The nature of the thing, and common experience proveth it.</p>
            <p>Christs Sermons recited in Scripture seem to be very short: You may call for a Text now to prove it a duty that a Sermon or Prayer should be an hour or a quarter of an hour long. It is enough that I prove it from the Aptitude of the Means to its end. Experience telleth us, that very few words and short time serve not to inform mens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings. And after that, the Will and Affections must have time to be duly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, and resolved; And more time is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary yet to drive the nail to the head, and to settle the soul against the force of all objections that may be produced to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; And yet more time to settle it in the right way of Practice. In a word, If <hi>short</hi> and <hi>seldome Preaching</hi> to <hi>others,</hi> be all that is any Preachers duty, murmur not that you are silenced, but write to Ministers to spare the Bishops the labour and <hi>odium,</hi> and to silence themselves, as to their long unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Sermons.</p>
            <p>If you say that Preaching is more of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution</hi> than <hi>Meditation,</hi> I deny it. There is here no <hi>magis</hi> or <hi>minus:</hi> If God have instituted both, it cannot be said that he hath instituted one more than the other;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59344:11"/>
Though it may be said that one (which ever it is) be of greater necessity than the other. And though I confess that he that Preacheth to himself, may omit and abbreviate much, which must be distinctly expressed to others, yet that doth but shew that <hi>Preaching</hi> must ordinarily be longer than such <hi>set medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi>; but not that these also must not have that Time, which Method and the Ends require, when it may be so done.</p>
            <p>Do you not think it as presumptuous to define the Time of a mans <hi>Conference</hi> about Scripture, with his Children and Servants daily, as to define the time of his Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? I suppose you will judge the case much like. Suppose then that I should say to a Master of a Family, [<hi>Besides your little occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal reflections, you that have Ability and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity may do well (yea must take it for your duty) oft times (even once a day, if no greater duty hinder you) to set some time apart to speak Methodically and seriously to your Families, first by way of explication and then of Application to convince them, and resolve them, and to drive all home to Practice,</hi> &amp;c.] Would you call for a Text to prove this a duty? I would give you then, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7, 8, 9. <hi>&amp; Deut.</hi> 11.18, 19, 20. for the Major; <hi>Ye shall teach them your Children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thy house,</hi> &amp;c. With <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59344:11"/>
26, 40. And the Minor I would prove by the Light of Nature and experience. The case is the same in the main, as to the exhorting of our selves.</p>
            <p>Truly, Brother, if your soul be not much more Heavenly than mine, it needeth a consi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derable time of holy exercise, to habituate it to converse above; and to bring it to the benefits of Meditation which we must desire. As I cannot get met heat with walking, no nor running neither, by the <hi>violence</hi> of the motion alone, unless I <hi>continue</hi> some conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time; no more can I in Prayer and <hi>Meditation</hi>; though my lazy humour too oft inclineth me, to sit down and content my self with a short <hi>Cogitation</hi> or wish; (Like the Prayers of those that wash them and button their Doublets and interpose other talk, and yet pray on.) And the warmth which I have once got, is quickly abated, if I give over the duty, and be short and seldome in it. Short and seldome thoughts of Heaven, will not serve with so bad a heart as mine, to keep up the Habit, much less to <hi>exercise</hi> a Heavenly mind, in that degree as all true Christians must confess desirable. And I suppose God hath therefore appointed us such variety of Ordinances and helpes, and such long and frequent use of them in their several turnes and times, which prophane men count but unnecessary preciseness, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59344:12"/>
so our hearts may be habituated to a holy and Heavenly frame, by the frequent and much use of holy and Heavenly exercises. For surely we add nothing unto God, nor do we change him, by our words or hours of Religious exercise; But we wait for his grace in the use of those means, which tend to prepare us both for Grace and Glory. And by the same reasonings as you will shift off, or shuffle this Meditation into some cursory thoughts on the by, the world would do so by Prayer, Preaching, Holy Conferences, Sacraments, and all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>But that several men must allow several proportions of Time for this duty, and that all cannot allow it the same Time, again I say, I will not suspect you to suppose and affirme me to deny.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Another thing that you oft mention is, that I say, <hi>Other thoughts should not be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt.</hi> And without giving you a Text for the Conclusion, the same kind of arguing will prove this, as proved the rest: Adding <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.10. and such like. If a man have <hi>Ability</hi> and <hi>Opportunity,</hi> will not attending wholly to the work in hand, best <hi>Edifie</hi> him and further the success? If not, intermix other thoughts also with your greatest stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, your Prayers, your Preaching, and do all <hi>diviso vel prae-occupato animo.</hi> Let the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59344:12"/>
People when you are preaching to them, talk in the Church to one another. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them not for thinking of other things. Or give them a Text of Scripture for the Conclusion, saying you may not think or talk of other matters at Sermon time.</p>
            <p>If you say, that Meditation is not to be a <hi>set duty</hi> as <hi>Preaching</hi> is, and therefore may lawfully be interrupted; I answer, If it be a <hi>duty</hi> commanded of the same God, it must in its place be regulated by the same General Laws, Let all be done to Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and in order. For my part, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixing thoughts do hinder the success with me; But what they may do with stronger heads and better hearts I know not.</p>
            <p>You say, p. 320. [<hi>But when I come to impose duties, as Meditation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>upon Christians to be performed by them in such a manner, and for such a time, and their soundness or unsound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, seriousness or sleightness is determined ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their performance according to that manner which I set down, surely I had need bring clear Scripture proof.</hi>—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> But if there be no word in my Writings that say any such things as deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of soundness or unsoundness by that <hi>manner</hi> of performance, what do you think the Reader that tryeth it, will think and say
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59344:13"/>
of you, and of such passages as these? I will not tell you lest I offend you. But only I tell you, This is not well done: And you had need to have proved what you intimate by some clear words of mine, if you would be believed.</p>
            <p>But <hi>p.</hi> 319. you argue <hi>à fine &amp; effectu,</hi> and say that <hi>Meditation is then rightly performed when the affections are wrought up unto a sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness with the Object I am Meditating on — Now let this Meditation be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how it will, let it be in what length or short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of time, what is that to the essence of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. How happy a heart have you, that will so easily be got up to a <hi>suitableness</hi> to God and Heaven! Is it not <hi>you</hi> now that forget the case of weak Christians? Verily such hearts as mine will need more adoe. It is not [<hi>performing Meditation how it will, in shortness</hi>] that will serve the turn, to bring my heart to such a suitableness. And I doubt all the weak ones whose case you seem to plead, are not much better.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59344:13"/>3. This savoureth much like the saying of a late Learned Physicion of ours, that said, <hi>What need all this adoe in Preaching and talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Religion, when all is dispatched in three words, Think well,</hi> and <hi>Speak well,</hi> and <hi>Do well.</hi> O but a great many words are necessary to bring us up to these three things: And so are a great many <hi>thoughts</hi> to bring our hearts to a <hi>suitableness</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> to <hi>Heaven.</hi> Tell me if you can, why the same arguing is not as strong against <hi>long Conference,</hi> or long Preaching? All that Sermons and Conference are to do is, to bring up our hearts to a sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness to the Object: And if this will be done by one <hi>sentence,</hi> what needs there a quarter of an houres Preaching or Catechising or Discourse: (And so away with this Preaching office;) But it is a false supposition that <hi>one sentence</hi> will <hi>do this,</hi> so well as more.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And when I think my heart is somewhat well affected, there is much yet to be done, to fix, and settle, and habituate, and direct it, which may be lost by hasty break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, and slubbering over so great a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>One work of Meditation is self-examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I may say as you, If I can but know my spiritual state, <hi>Let examination be performed how it will for length or shortness, what's that to the essence of the duty?</hi> But it is not such
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59344:14"/>
               <hi>performance</hi> that will acquaint me with my Condition. If I have not Time to consider of Evidences, and then of my heart and life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea and this with serious uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted thoughts, it will not do. I could put off Religious exercises as cursorily as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if cursory brevity would attain the end, and serve turn with such a heart as mine.</p>
            <p>But by all this, I conjecture, that you will be a gentle censurer of Ministers that Preach short and seldome, and of Parents that are short and seldome in family instructions, and of all Christians that are so in their Religious Conferences, unless your Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures bear no due proportion among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But yet you have somewhat to say of the Object of Meditation, <hi>The Joyes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> p. 315. and say [<hi>It must be supposed as they must have a title to Heaven, so they must know and be assured of that Title to Heaven; there must be no dark cloud,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Now I perceive we differ indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Do you think that neither <hi>unconverted</hi> nor <hi>unassured</hi> doubting persons, are called to Meditate much of Heaven?

            <p n="1">1. That Meditation is most profitable to the unconverted which tendeth most to

bring their hearts to the Love of God. But the Meditation of the Infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God revealed in the Heavenly Glory, and offered to all, tendeth most to bring their hearts to the Love of God, — <hi>Ergo</hi>—</p>
            <p>That which representeth God most amiable tendeth most to bring the soul to Love him. But the explication of the Heavenly Glory where he is enjoyed in the fullest Love, representeth God most amiable— <hi>Ergo</hi>—</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Meditation is most profitable to the unconverted, which tendeth most to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all carnal concupiscence and worldly Love, by drawing their hearts to better things. But such is the Meditation of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Glory—<hi>Ergo</hi>—</p>
            <p n="3">3. That Meditation is most profitable to a sinners Conversion, which draweth him most effectually to consent to the Covenant of Grace (For that consent is Conversion.) But such is the Meditation of the Heavenly feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city —<hi>Ergo</hi>—</p>
            <p n="4">4. That Meditation is most profitable which tendeth most to make men Repent of sin, and be fully willing of a holy life. But such is the Meditation of Heaven (when they see what sin depriveth men of, and what they are like to get by Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness)—</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59344:15"/>5. That Meditation is most profitable to conversion, which fullyest sheweth men the excellency of Christ and of all his Grace. But such is the Meditation of Heaven, (as being the highest benefit of Christ and Grace)— <hi>Ergo</hi>—</p>
            <p n="6">6. That Meditation is most profitable to the wicked, which tendeth most to save them from Temptations: But such is the Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heaven, (as setting that in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance which alone can weigh down all that can be offered by the tempter)—.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That is the most profitable Meditation which is exercised on <hi>God</hi> in his fullest Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation — But, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. That is the most profitable and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Meditation which is about the <hi>ultimate</hi> End; Because that it is the End that is Loved for it self, and all means but for the End: And the End guideth us in the choise, the estimation and the use of means, and is the very life of them all — But, <hi>&amp;c</hi>— <hi>Ergo.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> Preached the Kingdom of Heaven, more expresly than the Person of the Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah: And Christ sent his Disciples to Preach the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> when he forbad them to tell men that he was the <hi>Christ,</hi> (because the Miracles, Resurrection, and other Proofs of it, must <hi>first be made,</hi> and <hi>then be Preached</hi> to win belief) <hi>Luke</hi> 9.2, 21. And by the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59344:15"/>
               <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> he meant that of <hi>Grace,</hi> as related to <hi>Glory,</hi> vers. 27, 28.</p>
            <p>It is the want of thinking more seriously what <hi>Heaven is,</hi> and the certainty of it to all believers, that causeth men to follow the flesh and world, and to lose it by contempt or gross neglect. Ungodliness consisteth much in a neglect of Heaven, for want of convincing, quickning Meditations of it. And when you bring a sinner to be but soberly <hi>thoughtful</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> you have done much towards his true Conversion. So that in this, you and I do vastly differ, if you think as you write.</p>
            <p>I will crave your pardon for my over-pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all the rest of your opposition (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that I have spoken to the main,) and shall shut up all with these three professions and admonitions to the Reader.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Since I find that this judicious worthy man hath made these exceptions, I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered again whether there be not cause; And I find what long agoe I found, that I was too blame that I observed no more, the weakness and danger of melancholy persons, when I first wrote it; and that I was not more large in disswading them from taking that to be their work which they cannot do. For I believe I have spoken with farr more than ever this Reverend Brother hath done (though he be a Physicion) who have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59344:16"/>
been disabled by Melancholy and other weakness of brain from this work: which made me so oft since give them such warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And I do here again desire, most Women and all Melancholy persons, to take up more with shorter and occasional Meditations, and with such holy thoughts as good Books and Conference do more easily bring into their minds; and not to over-stretch their brains, by striving to do more than they are able, and so disable themselves yet more.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The review of these things doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me, that Learned men, and all men of <hi>Opportunity</hi> and <hi>Ability</hi> to bear Meditation, should use this duty much more than they do; And that much of our ignorance, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, ungodliness and uncomfortableness is for want of making a set and serious business of it. And I think that few men that Labour in their Shops, or ever walk or travel abroad, can truly say, that they are wholly destitute of leisure. And I think that poverty and crosses in the world, should make the thoughts of Heaven the more welcome to them; And that it should be so farr from being taken for an ungrateful burden, that it should be the sweetest pleasure in this World; and farr more delightful, than to think of Lands or dearest Friends. And I admonish all that have <hi>Ability</hi> and <hi>Opportunity</hi> to take heed lest
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59344:16"/>
short and seldome and slight thoughts of Heaven, do harden them in that unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness above, which will be the unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p n="3">III. Though I said it not before, I will now say, that even <hi>Methodical Heavenly</hi> Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is a <hi>Duty</hi> to all that have the free use of Reason; But not a Duty which they are presently fit, and able to performe; And therefore it is (as the Sacrament to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared) a <hi>mediate</hi> duty: They sin in not doing it, because they sin in being <hi>unprepared</hi> for it.

it self is in danger of judging it no better or more necessary than we feel it.</p>
            <p>For my own part, when my Conscience commandeth me to omit Meditation, because of some greater and more urgent duty, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding it at that time, I usually find that it is my affliction to fall under any such diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, that both may not be done. And I find that whatever else I think of, of Christ, of Scripture, of Promises, of Threatnings, of sin, of Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if I leave out <hi>Heaven</hi> and make it not the chief part of my Meditation, I leave out the sence and Life of all. Thence must I fetch my Light, or I must be in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; Thence must I fetch my Life, or I must be Dead, and my <hi>Motives</hi> or I must be Dull, or not sincere; and my daily Comforts, or I must be uncomfortable or worse. My Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Reading, and Studies grow to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon things, if Heaven be not the principal part: My life groweth towards a common and a carnal Life, when I begin to leave out Heaven: Death groweth terrible to my thoughts, and Eternity strange and dreadful to me, if I live not in such frequent and serious thoughts of the Heavenly Glory, as may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it familiar and grateful to my soul. Yea I cannot think with any due <hi>Knowledge, Love</hi> or <hi>Pleasure,</hi> of the ever-blessed God himself, if I think of him only as he is revealed to us
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59344:18"/>
in this World, and not as we shall see him in the World of Light. I find my self but a common man, if Heavenliness make me not to differ: And I find my self unfit to Live or to Die, and that my soul is void of the true Consolation, that is needful both in Life and at Death, when I grow a stranger to Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Thoughts, and consequently to Heavenly Affections: And that as nothing will serve turn instead of Heaven to be my Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; so nothing will serve turn instead of Heaven to make up the end of my Religion, and forme my Heart and Life to Holiness. And therefore by experience I counsel all Christians that are able to perform it, especially Ministers, and Learned men, to be much in the serious fore-thoughts of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and to <hi>Comfort themselves</hi> and others with these words, that <hi>We shall for ever be with the Lord,</hi> 1 Thes. 4.17, 18.</p>
            <p>And I adjure the Reader, not to conceive of the worthy person to whom I write this, as any Adversary to a Heavenly Life: For he is a Sober, Godly, faithful Minister (though silenced) who hath been in New <hi>England</hi>; and brought back with him a great deal of Judgement and Moderation, in Church-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as having seen the experience of the evil of extreams (as his former Writings witness.) And as he opposeth not Mr. <hi>Rogers,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59344:18"/>
Hooker, Shephard,</hi> out of any ill-will to their Persons, but lest those whom he best loved should wrong the Church, so I have reason to believe that he doth with the same Candour, deal with me. And if we do differ at all (which I am not sure of) it is so little as is not like to cause the least disaffection. I would all our differences made no wider a distance than is betwixt this faithful Brother and Me.—</p>
