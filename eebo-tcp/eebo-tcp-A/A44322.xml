         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Potentia Restitutiva,
OR
SPRING.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Theory of Springs, though
attempted by divers eminent
Mathematicians of this Age
has hitherto not been Published
by any. It it now about eighteen
years since I first found it out,
but designing to apply it to some
particular use, I omitted the
publishing thereof.</p>
            <p>About three years since His Majesty was pleased to
see the Experiment that made out this Theory tried
at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> as also my Spring Watch.</p>
            <p>About two years since I printed this Theory in an
Anagram at the end of my Book of the Descriptions of
Helioscopes, <hi>viz. ceiiinosssttuu, id est, Vt tensio sic
vis;</hi> That is, The Power of any Spring is in the same
proportion with the Tension thereof: That is, if one
power stretch or bend it one space, two will bend it
two, and three will bend it three, and so forward.
Now as the Theory is very short, so the way of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is very easie.</p>
            <p>Take then a quantity of even-drawn Wire, either
Steel, Iron, or Brass, and coyl it on an even Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
into a Helix of what length or number of turns
you please, then turn the ends of the Wire into
Loops, by one of which suspend this coyl upon a
nail, and by the other sustain the weight that you
would have to extend it, and hanging on several
Weights observe exactly to what length each of the
weights do extend it beyond the length that its own
weight doth stretch it to, and you shall find that if
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107034:3"/>
one ounce, or one pound, or one certain weight
doth lengthen it one line, or one inch, or one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
length, then two ounces, two pounds, or two
weights will extend it two lines, two inches, or
two lengths; and three ounces, pounds, or weights,
three lines, inches, or lengths; and so forwards. And
this is the Rule or Law of Nature, upon which all
manner of Restituent or Springing motion doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
whether it be of Rarefaction, or Extension, or
Condensation and Compression.</p>
            <p>Or take a Watch Spring, and coyl it into a Spiral,
so as no part thereof may touch another, then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
a very light wheel of Brass, or the like, and fix
it on an arbor that hath two small Pivots of Steel,
upon which Pivot turn the edge of the said Wheel
very even and smooth, so that a small silk may be
coyled upon it; then put this Wheel into a Frame, so
that the Wheel may move very freely on its Pivots;
fasten the central end of the aforesaid Spring close to
the Pivot hole or center of the frame in which the
Arbor of the Wheel doth move, and the other end
thereof to the Rim of the Wheel, then coyling a fine
limber thread of silk upon the edge of the Wheel
hang a small light scale at the end thereof fit to receive
the weight that shall be put thereinto; then suffering
the Wheel to stand in its own position by a little index
fastned to the frame, and pointing to the Rim of the
Wheel, make a mark with Ink, or the like, on that
part of the Rim that the Index pointeth at; then put
in a drachm weight into the scale, and suffer the
Wheel to settle, and make another mark on the Rim
where the Index doth point; then add a drachm more,
and let the Wheel settle again, and note with Ink, as
before, the place of the Rim pointed at by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex;
then add a third drachm, and do as before, and
so a fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Wheel to settle, and marking the several
places pointed at by the Index, then examine the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107034:3"/>
Distances of all those marks, and comparing them
together you shall find that they will all be equal
the one to the other, so that if a drachm doth move
the Wheel ten degrees, two drachms will move it
twenty, and three thirty, and four forty, and five
fifty, and so forwards.</p>
            <p>Or take a Wire string of twenty, or thirty, or
forty foot long, and fasten the upper part thereof to
a nail, and to the other end fasten a Scale to receive
the weights: Then with a pair of Compasses take the
distance of the bottom of the scale from the ground
or floor underneath, and set down the said distance,
then put in weights into the said scale in the same
manner as in the former, trials, and measure the several
stretchings of the said string, and set them down.
Then compare the several stretchings of the said
string, and you will find that they will always bear
the same proportions one to the other that the weights
do that made them.</p>
            <p>The same will be found, if trial be made, with a
piece of dry wood that will bend and return, if one
end thereof be fixt in a horizontal posture, and to
the other end be hanged weights to make it bend
downwards.</p>
            <p>The manner of trying the same thing upon a body
of Air, whether it be for the rarefaction or for the
compression thereof I did about fourteen years since
publish in my <hi>Micrographia,</hi> and therefore I shall
not need to add any further description thereof.</p>
            <p>Each of these ways will be more plainly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by the explanations of the annexed figures.</p>
            <p>The first whereof doth represent by AB the coyl
or helix of Wire, C the end of it, by which it is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spended,
D the other end thereof, by which a small
Scale E is hanged, into which putting Weights
as FGHIKLMN, singly and separately they being
in proportion to one another as 12345678, the
Spring will be thereby equally stretcht to <hi>o, p, q, r, s, t, u, w,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:107034:4"/>
that is, if F stretch it so as the bottom of the Scale
descend to <hi>o,</hi> then G will make it descend to <hi>p,</hi>
H to <hi>q,</hi> I to <hi>r,</hi> K to <hi>s,</hi> L to <hi>t,</hi> M to <hi>u,</hi> and N to <hi>w,</hi> &amp;c.
So that <hi>xo</hi> shall be one space, <hi>xp, 2, xq, 3, xr, 4,
xs, 5, xt, 6, xu, 7, xw,</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>The second figure represents a Watch Spring coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in a Spiral by CABBBD, whose end C is fixed
to a pin or Axis immovable, into the end of which
the Axis of a small light Wheel is inserted, upon
which it moves; the end D is fixed to a pin in the
Rim of the Wheel yyyy, upon which is coyled a
small silk, to the end of which is fixed a Scale to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the weights. To the frame in which these are
contained is fixed the hand or Index z; then trying
with the former weights put into the Scale E, you
will find that if F put into the Scale E sinks the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of it x to <hi>o,</hi> then G will sink it to <hi>p,</hi> and H to <hi>q,</hi>
I to <hi>r,</hi> K to <hi>s,</hi> L to <hi>t,</hi> and z will point at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
on the Wheel.</p>
            <p>The trials with a straight wire, or a straight piece
of wood laid Horizontal are so plain they need not
an explication by figure, and the way of trying upon
Air I have long since explained in my <hi>Micogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi>
by figures.</p>
            <p>From all which it is very evident that the Rule or
Law of Nature in every springing body is, that
the force or power thereof to restore it self to its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
position is always proportionate to the Distance
or space it is removed therefrom, whether it be by
rarefaction, or separation of its parts the one from the
other, or by a Condensation, or crowding of those
parts nearer together. Nor is it observable in these
bodys only, but in all other springy bodies whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
whether Metal, Wood, Stones, baked Earths,
Hair, Horns, Silk, Bones, Sinews, Glass, and the like.
Respect being had to the particular figures of the
bodies bended, and the advantagious or disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
ways of bending them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:107034:4"/>
From this Principle it will be easie to calculate
the several strength of Bows, as of Long Bows or
Cross-Bows, whether they be made of Wood, Steel,
Horns, Sinews, or the like. As also of the <hi>Balistae</hi> or
<hi>Catapultae</hi> used by the Ancients, which being once
found, and Tables thereof calculated, I shall anon
shew a way how to calculate the power they have
in shooting or casting of Arrows, Bullets, Stones,
Granadoes, or the like.</p>
            <p>From these Principles also it will be easie to calculate
the proportionate strength of the spring of a Watch
upon the Fusey thereof, and consequently of adjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Fusey to the Spring so as to make it draw or
move the Watch always with an equal force.</p>
            <p>From the same also it will be easie to give the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the <hi>Isochrone</hi> motion of a Spring or extended
string, and of the uniform sound produced by those
whose Vibrations are quick enough to produce an
audible sound, as likewise the reason of the sounds,
and their variations in all manner of sonorous or
springing Bodies, of which more on another occasion.</p>
            <p>From this appears the reason, as I shall shew by
and by, why a Spring applied to the balance of a
Watch doth make the Vibrations thereof equal, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be greater or smaller, one of which kind I
shewed to the right Honourable the Lord Viscount
<hi>Brounker,</hi> the Honourable <hi>Robert Boyle</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> and Sir
<hi>Robert Morey</hi> in the year 1660. in order to have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Letters Patents for the use and benefit thereof.</p>
            <p>From this it will be easie to make a Philosophical
Scale to examine the weight of any body without
putting in weights, which was that which I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
at the end of my description of Helioscopes, the
ground of which was veiled under this Anagram,
<hi>cediinnoopsssttuu,</hi> namely, <hi>Vt pondus sic ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio.</hi>
The fabrick of which see in the three first figures.</p>
            <p>This Scale I contrived in order to examine the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation
of bodies towards the Center of the Earth,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107034:5"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> to examine whether bodies at a further distance
from the Center of the Earth did not lose somewhat
of their power or tendency towards it. And pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
it as one of the Experiments to be tried at
the top of the Pike of <hi>Teneriff,</hi> and attempted the
same at the top of the Tower of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> before the
burning of it in the late great Fire; as also at the top
and bottom of the Abby of St. <hi>Peters</hi> in <hi>Westminster</hi>
though these being by but small distances removed
from the Surface, I was not able certainly to perceive
any manifest difference. I propounded the same also to
be tried at the bottom and several stations of deep
Mines; and D. <hi>Power</hi> did make some trials to that end,
but his Instruments not being good, nothing could be
certainly concluded from them.</p>
            <p>These are the Phenomena of Springs and springy
bodies, which as they have not hitherto been by any
that I know reduced to Rules, so have all the attempts
for the explications of the reason of their power, and
of springiness in general, been very insufficient.</p>
            <p>In the year 1660. I printed a little Tract, which I
called, <hi>An Attempt for the explication of the Phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
&amp;c.</hi> of the rising of water in the pores of very
small Pipes, Filtres, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And being unwilling then to
publish this Theory, as supposing it might be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to my design of Watches, which I was then
procuring a Patent for, I only hinted the principle
which I supposed to be the cause of these Phaenomena
of springs in the 31 page thereof in the English Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and in the 38 page of the Latine Edition, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
by <hi>M. Behem,</hi> and printed at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> 1662.
But referred the further explication thereof till some
other opportunity.</p>
            <p>The Principles I then mentioned I called by the
names of <hi>Congruity</hi> and <hi>Incongruity</hi> of bodies. And
promised a further explanation of what I thereby
meant on some other occasion. I shall here only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
so much of it as concerns the explication of this
present Phaenomenon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:107034:5"/>
By <hi>Congruity</hi> and <hi>Incongruity</hi> then I understand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but an agreement or disagreement of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys
as to their Magnitudes and motions.</p>
            <p>Those Bodies then I suppose congruous whose
particles have the same Magnitude, and the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Velocity, or else an harmonical proportion
of Magnitude, and harmonical degree of Velocity.
And those I suppose incongruous which have neither
the same Magnitude, nor the same degree of Velocity,
nor an harmonical proportion of Magnitude nor of
Velocity.</p>
            <p>I suppose then the sensible Universe to consist of
body and motion.</p>
            <p>By Body I mean somewhat receptive and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative
of motion or progression. Nor can I have any
other Idea thereof, for neither Extention nor Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
hardness nor softness, fluidity nor fixedness, Rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
nor Densation are the proprieties of Body,
but of Motion or somewhat moved.</p>
            <p>By Motion I understand nothing but a power or
tendency progressive of Body according to several de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Velocity.</p>
            <p>These two do always counterballance each other in
all the effects, appearances, and operations of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and therefore it is not impossible but that they
may be one and the same; for a little body with great
motion is equivalent to a great body with little moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as to all its sensible effects in Nature.</p>
            <p>I do further suppose then that all things in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
that become the objects of our senses are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of these two (which we will for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
suppose distinct essences, though possibly they
may be found hereafter to be only differing concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of one and the same essence) namely, <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
And that there is no one sensible Particle of matter
but owes the greatest part of its sensible Extension to
Motion whatever part thereof it ows to Body accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the common notion thereof: Which is, that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107034:6"/>
Body is somewhat that doth perfectly fill a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
quantity of space or extension so as necessarily
to exclude all other bodies from being comprehended
within the same Dimensions.</p>
            <p>I do therefore define a sensible Body to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate
Space or Extension defended from being
penetrated by another, by a power from within.</p>
            <p>To make this the more intelligible, Imagine a
very thin plate of Iron, or the like, a foot square,
to be moved with a Vibrative motion forwards and
backwards the flat ways the length of a foot with
so swift a motion as not to permit any other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to enter into that space within which it Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates,
this will compose such an essence as I call in
my sense a Cubick foot of sensible Body, which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
from the common notion of Body as this space
of a Cubick foot thus defended by this Vibrating plate
doth from a Cubick foot of Iron, or the like, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
solid. The Particles therefore that compose all
bodies I do suppose to owe the greatest part of their
sensible or potential Extension to a Vibrative motion.</p>
            <p>This Vibrative motion I do not suppose inherent or
inseparable from the Particles of body, but communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by Impulses given from other bodies in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.
This only I suppose, that the Magnitude or
bulk of the body doth make it receptive of this or-that
peculiar motion that is communicated, and not
of any other. That is, every Particle of matter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to its determinate or present Magnitude is
receptive of this or that peculiar motion and no
other, so that Magnitude and receptivity of motion
seems the same thing: To explain this by a similitude or
example. Suppose a number of musical strings, as ABC+DE,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> tuned to certain tones, and a like number of
other strings, as <hi>a, b, c, d, e,</hi> &amp;c. turned to the same sounds
respectively, A shall be receptive of the motion of <hi>a,</hi>
but not of that of <hi>b, c,</hi> nor <hi>d;</hi> in like manner B shall be
receptive of the motion of <hi>b,</hi> but not of the motion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107034:6"/>
of <hi>a, c</hi> or <hi>d.</hi> And so of the rest. This is that which
I call <hi>Congruity</hi> and <hi>Incongruity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as we find that musical strings will be moved
by Unisons and Eighths, and other harmonious chords,
though not in the same degree; so do I suppose that
<hi>the particles of matter</hi> will be moved principally by
such motions as are Unisons, as I may call them, or of
equal Velocity with their motions, and by other har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
motions in a less degree.</p>
            <p>I do further suppose, A subtil matter that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth
and pervades all other bodies, which is the
Menstruum in which they swim which maintains and
continues all such bodies in their motion, and which
is the medium that conveys all Homogenious or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monical
motions from body to body.</p>
            <p>Further I suppose, that all such particles of matter
as are of a like nature, when not separated by others
of a differing nature will remain together, and
strengthen the common Vibration of them all against
the differing Vibrations of the ambient bodies.</p>
            <p>According to this Notion I suppose the whole
Universe and all the particles thereof to be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
motion, and every one to take its share of
space or room in the same, according to the bulk of
its body, or according to the particular power
it hath to receive, and continue this or that peculiar
motion.</p>
            <p>Two or more of these particles joyned immediately
together, and coalescing into one become of another
nature, and receptive of another degree of motion
and Vibration, and make a compounded particle
differing in nature from each of the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</p>
            <p>All bulky and sensible bodies whatsoever I suppose
to be made up or composed of such particles which
have their peculiar and appropriate motions which are
kept together by the differing or dissonant Vibrations
of the ambient bodies or fluid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:107034:7"/>
According to the difference of these Vibrative
motions of the Incompassing bulks. All bodies are
more or less powerful in preserving their peculiar
shapes.</p>
            <p>All bodies neer the Earth are incompassed with
a fluid subtil matter by the differing Velocity of
whose parts all solid bodies are kept together in the
peculiar shapes, they were left in when they were last
fluid. And all fluid bodies whatsoever are mixed
with this fluid, and which is not extruded from them
till they become solid.</p>
            <p>Fluid bulks differ from solids only in this, that all
fluids consist of two sorts of particles, the one this
common Menstruum near the Earth, which is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed
between the Vibrating particles appropriated
to that bulk, and so participating of the motions and
Vibrations thereof: And the other, by excluding
wholly, or not participating of that motion.</p>
            <p>Though the particles of solid bodies do by their
Vibrative motions exclude this fluid from coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them where their motions do immediately
touch, yet are there certain spaces between them
which are not defended by the motion of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
from being pervaded by the Heterogeneous
fluid menstruum.</p>
            <p>These spaces so undefended by the bodies and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brative
motion of the particles, and consequently
pervaded by the subtil incompassing Heterogeneous
fluid are those we call the insensible pores of
bodies.</p>
            <p>According to the bigness of the bodies the motions
are, but in reciprocal proportion: That is, the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or more powerful the body is, the flower is its
motion with which it compounds the particles; and
the less the body is, the swifter is its motion.</p>
            <p>The smaller the particles of bodies are, the nearer
do they approach to the nature of the general fluid,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107034:7"/>
and the more easily do they mix and participate of its
motion.</p>
            <p>The Particles of all solid bodies do immediately
touch each other; that is, the Vibrative motions of
the bodies do every one touch each other at every
Vibration. For explication, Let ABC represent
three bodies, each of
these bodies I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<figure/>
to have a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brative
motion on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side of it, A be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
D and E, B be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
E and F, and C between F and G. I suppose
then that B in every one of its Vibrations doth meet
A at E, and C at F, and so the motions are continually
interchanged: That is, B communicates its motion to
A at E, and A at the same time and place communicates
its motion to B, which returning to F meets there
with C, and communicates its received motion to C,
which at the same instant and place communicates its
own motion to B, which returns it back to E: So
that the Velocity of these bodies is always the same,
and each body impresseth on the contiguous bodies
such a determinate number of pulses within a certain
space of time. Suppose for instance, in every second
of time B communicates to A and to C one million
of pulses, and hath received as many from each
of them, by which means each of them doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
its own space of Vibration, according to the
power of its Vibration, that neither of the contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
bodies can enter into it. The extreme particles
A and C are repercussed by the motion of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient
Heterogeneous fluid, whereof though the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are of differing magnitudes, yet the body and
motion of the one are equivalent to the body and
motion of the other, so that whatever the body be
less, the motion is quicker; and where the body is
bigger, the motion is less. But the Particles of fluid
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107034:8"/>
bodies do not immediately touch each other, but
permit the mixture of the other Heterogeneous fluid
near the Earth, which serves to communicate the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from particle to particle without the immediate
contact of the Vibrations of the Particles.</p>
            <p>All solid Bodies retain their solidity till by other
extraordinary motions their natural or proper moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
become intermixed with other differing motions,
and so they become a bulk of compounded motions,
which weaken each others Vibrative motions. So
that though the similar parts do participate of each
others motions, whereby they indeavour to joyn or
keep together, yet do they also participate of an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous
motion which endeavours to separate
or keep them asunder. And according to the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the one or the other is the body more or less
fluid or solid.</p>
            <p>All bodies whatsoever would be fluid were it not
for the external Heterogeneous motion of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient.</p>
            <p>And all fluid bodies whatsoever would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded,
and have their parts fly from each other
were it not for some prevailing Heterogeneous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from without them that drives them more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
together.</p>
            <p>Heterogeneous motions from without are propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
within the solid in a direct line if they hit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
to the superficies or bounds, but if ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely
in ways not direct, but different and deflected,
according to the particular inclination of the body
striking, and according to the proportion of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
striking and being struck.</p>
            <p>All springy bodies whatsoever consist of parts thus
qualified, that is, of small bodies indued with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
and peculiar motions, whence every one of
these particles hath a particular Bulk, Extension, or
Sphere of activity which it defends from the ingress
of any other incompassing Heterogeneous body whilst
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107034:8"/>
in its natural estate and balance in the Universe. Which
particles being all of the same nature, that is, of
equal bodies, and equal motions, they readily co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alesce
and joyn together, and make up one solid bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
not perfectly every where contiguous, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excluding the above mentioned ambient fluid, but
permitting it in many places to pervade the same in a
regular order, yet not so much but that they do whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exclude the same from passing between all the sides
of the compounding particles.</p>
            <p>The parts of all springy bodies would recede and
fly from each other were they not kept together by
the Heterogeneous compressing motions of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient
whether fluid or solid.</p>
            <p>These principles thus hinted, I shall in the next
place come to the particular explication of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
how they serve to explain the Phaenomena of
springing bodies whether solid or fluid.</p>
            <p>First for solid bodies, as Steel, Glass, Wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which have a Spring both inwards and outwards, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as they are either compressed or dilated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their natural state.
<figure/>
            </p>
            <p>Let AB represent a line of such a body compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of eight Vibrating particles, as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
and suppose each of those Particles to perform a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of single Vibrations, and consequently of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions
with each other in a second minute of time,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107034:9"/>
their motion being of such a Velocity impressed from
the Ambient on the two extreme Particles 1 and 8.
First, if by any external power on the two extremes
1 and 8, they be removed further asunder, as to CD,
then shall all the Vibrative Particles be proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
extended, and the number of Vibrations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
of occursions be reciprocally diminished,
and consequently their endeavour of receding from
each other be reciprocally diminished also. For sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
this second Dimension of Length be to the
first as 3 to 2, the length of the Vibrations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
of occursions, be reciprocally diminished.
For whereas I supposed 1000000 in a second of the
former, here can be but 666666 in this, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the Spring inward must be in proportion to
the Extension beyond its natural length.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if by any external force the extreme par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
be removed a third part nearer together than
(the external natural force being alway the same
both in this and the former instance, which is the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
to it in its natural state) the length of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations
shall be proportionably diminished, and the
number of them, and consequently of the occursions
be reciprocally augmented, and instead of 1000000,
there shall be 1500000.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:107034:9"/>
Having thus explained the most simple way of
springing in solid bodies, it will be very easie to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the compound way of springing, that is, by
flexure, supposing only two of these lines joyned
<figure/>
together as at GHIK, which being by any external
power bended into the form LNNO, LM will be
extended, and NO will be diminished in proportion
to the flexure, and consequently the same proportions
and Rules for its endeavour of restoring it self will
hold.</p>
            <p>In the next place for fluid bodies, amongst which
the greatest instance we have is air, though the same be
in some proportion in all other fluid bodies.</p>
            <p>The Air then is a body consisting of particles so
small as to be almost equal to the particles of the
Heterogeneous fluid medium incompassing the earth.
It is bounded but on one side, namely, towards the
earth, and is indefinitely extended upward being
only hindred from flying away that way by its own
gravity, (the cause of which I shall some other time
explain.) It consists of the same particles single and
separated, of which water and other fluids do, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
and compounded, and being made of particles
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107034:10"/>
exceeding small, its motion (to make its ballance with
the rest of the earthy bodies) is exceeding swift, and
its Vibrative Spaces exceeding large, comparative to
the Vibrative Spaces of other terrestrial bodies. I
suppose that of the Air next the Earth in its natural
state may be 8000 times greater than that of Steel,
and above a thousand times greater than that of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
water, and proportionably I suppose that its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
must be eight thousand times swifter than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and above a thousand times swifter than the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
If therefore a quantity of this body be inclosed
by a solid body, and that be so contrived as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
it into less room, the motion thereof (supposing
the heat the same) will continue the same, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the Vibrations and Occursions will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
in reciprocal proportion, that is, if it be
Condensed into half the space the Vibrations and
Occursions will be double in number: If into a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Vibrations and Occursions will be cua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druple,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, If the conteining Vessel be so contrived as
to leave it more space, the length of the Vibrations
will be proportionably inlarged, and the number of
Vibrations and Occursions will be reciprocally dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
that is, if it be suffered to extend to twice its
former dimensions, its Vibrations will be twice as
long, and the number of its Vibrations and Occursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will be fewer by half, and consequently its indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
outward will be also weaker by half.</p>
            <p>These Explanations will serve <hi>mutatis mutandis</hi> for
explaining the Spring of any other Body whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>It now remains, that I shew how the constitutions
of springy bodies being such, the Vibrations of a
Spring, or a Body moved by a Spring, equally and
uniformly shall be of equal duration whether they be
greater or less.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:107034:10"/>
I have here already shewed then that the power of
all Springs is proportionate to the degree of flexure,
<hi>viz.</hi> one degree of flexure, or one space bended hath
one power, two hath two, and three hath three, and
so forward, And every point of the space of flexure
hath a peculiar power, and consequently there being
infinite points of the space, there must be infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of power.</p>
            <p>And consequently all those powers beginning from
nought, and ending at the last degree of tension or
bending, added together into one sum, or aggregate,
will be in duplicate proportion to the space bended or
degree of flexure; that is, the aggregate of the
powers of the Spring tended from its quiescent po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
by all the intermediate points to one space
(be it what length you please) is equal, or in the
same proportion to the square of one (supposing
the said space infinitely divisible into the fractions of
one;) to two, is equal, or in the same proportion to
the square of two, that is four; to three is equal or
in the same proportion to the square of three, that is
nine, and so forward; and consequently the aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
of the first space will be one, of the second space
will be three, of the third space will be five, of the
fourth will be seven, and so onwards in an Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
proportion, being the degrees or excesses by
which these aggregates exceed one another.</p>
            <p>The Spring therefore in returning from any degree
of flexure, to which it hath been bent by any power
receiveth at every point of the space returned an
impulse equal to the power of the Spring in that
point of Tension, and in returning the whole it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
the whole aggregate of all the forces belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the greatest degree of that Tension from which
it returned; so a Spring bent two spaces in its return
receiveth four degrees of impulse, that is, three in
the first space returning, and one in the second; so
bent three spaces it receiveth in its whole return nine
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107034:11"/>
degrees of impulse, that is, five in the first space re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
three in the second, and one in the third.</p>
            <p>So bent ten spaces it receives in its whole return
one hundred degrees of impulse, to wit, nineteen in
the first, seventeen in the second, fifteen in the third,
thirteen in the fourth, eleven in the fifth, nine in the
sixth, seven in the seventh, five in the eighth, three
in the ninth, and one in the tenth.</p>
            <p>Now the comparative Velocities of any body mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
are in subduplicate proportion to the aggregates
or sums of the powers by which it is moved, therefore
the Velocities of the whole spaces returned are always
in the same proportions with those spaces, they being
both subduplicate to the powers, and consequently
all the times shall be equal.</p>
            <p>Next for the Velocities of the parts of the space
returned they will be always proportionate to the
roots of the aggregates of the powers impressed
in every of these spaces; for in the last instance,
where the Spring is supposed bent ten spaces,
the Velocity at the end of the first space returned
shall be as the root of 19. at the end of the second
as the Root of 36. that is, of 19 + 17. at the end of
the third as the the Root of 51. that is of 19 + 17
+ 15. At the end of the fourth as the Root
of 64. that is of 19 + 17 + 15 + 13. at the end of
the tenth, or whole as the Root of 100. that is as
√19 + 17 + 15 + 13 + 11 + 9 + 7 + 5 + 3
+ 1, equal to 100.</p>
            <p>Now since the Velocity is in the same proportion
to the root of the space, as the root of the space is to
the time, it is easie to determine the particular time
in which every one of these spaces are passed for
dividing the spaces by the Velocities corresponding
the quotients give the particular times.</p>
            <p>To explain this more intelligibly, let A in the fourth
figure represent the end of a Spring not bent, or at least
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107034:11"/>
counterpoised in that posture by a power fixt to it, and
movable with it, draw the line ABC, and let it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the way in which the end of the Spring by addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
powers is to be moved, draw to the end of it
C at right Angles the Line C <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> D <hi>d,</hi> and let CD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
the power that is sufficient to bend or move
the end of the Spring A to C, then draw the Line DA,
and from any point of the Line AC as BB. Draw Lines
parallel to CD, cutting the Line DA in E, E, the
Lines BE, BE, will represent the respective powers
requisite to bend the end of the Spring A to B, which
Lines BE, BE, CD will be in the same proportion with
the length of the bent of the Spring AB, AB, AC.</p>
            <p>And because the Spring hath in every point of the
Line of bending AC, a particular power, therefore ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
infinite Lines drawn from every point of AC
parallel to CD till they touch the Line AD, they will
all of them fill and compose the Triangle ACD. The
Triangle therefore ACD will represent the aggregate
of the powers of the Spring bent from A to C, and
the lesser Triangles ABE, ABE will represent the
aggregate of all the powers of the Spring bent from
A to B, B, and the Spring bent to any point of the
Line AC, and let go from thence will exert in its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to A all those powers which are equal to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
ordinates BE, BE, in the Triangles, the sum
of all which make up the Triangles ABE, ABE.
And the aggregate of the powers with which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
from any point, as from C to any point of the
space CA as to BB, is equal to the Trapezium
CDEB, CDEB, or the excesses of the greater
Triangles above the less.</p>
            <p>Having therefore shewn an Image to represent the
flexure and the powers, so as plainly to solve and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
all Questions and Problems concerning them, in
the next place I come to represent the Velocities ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to the several powers. The Velocities
then being always in a subduplicate proportion of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107034:12"/>
the powers, that is, as the Root of the powers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
and the powers imprest being as the Trapezi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
or the excess of the Triangle or square of the
whole space to be past above the square of the space
yet unpassed; if upon the Center A, and space AC,
(C being the point from which the Spring is supposed
let go) a Circle be described as CGGF, and ordinates
drawn from any point of CA the space to be past,
as from B, B, to the said Circle, as BG, BG, these Lines
BG, BG, will represent the Velocity of the Spring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
from C to B, B, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the said ordinates being
always in the same proportion with the Roots of the
Trapeziums CDEB, CDEB for putting AC =
to a, and AB = b, BG will always be equal to
√ aa—bb, the square of the ordinate being always
equal to the Rectangle of the intercepted parts of the
Diameter.</p>
            <p>Having thus found the Velocities, to wit, BG, BG,
AF, to find the times corresponding, on the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
AC draw a Parabola CHF whose Vertex is C, and
which passeth through the point F. The Ordinates
of this Parabola BH, BH, AF, are in the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
with the Roots of the spaces CB, CB, CA,
then making GB to HB as HB to IB, and through
the points CIIF drawing the curve CIIIF, the
respective ordinates of this curve shall represent the
proportionate time that the Spring spends in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
the spaces CB, CB, CA.</p>
            <p>If the powers or stiffness of the Spring be greater
than what I before supposed, and therefore must be
expressed by the Triangle CdeA. then the Velocities
will be the Ordinates in an Ellipse as C <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> N, greater
than the Circle, as it will also if the power be the
same, and the bulk moved by the Spring be less. Then
will the S-like Line of times meet with the Line AF
at a point as X within the point F. But if the powers of
the Spring be weaker than I supposed, then will C <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ee+A
represent the powers, and C <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> O the Ellipsis of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107034:12"/>
Velocity, whose Ordinates B<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, B<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, AO will give the
particular Velocities, and the S-like Line of time will
extend beyond N. The same will happen supposing
the body (moved by the Spring) to be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionately
heavy, and the powers of the Spring the
same with the first.</p>
            <p>And supposing the power of the Spring the same
as at first, bended only to B2, and from thence let go
B2EA is the Triangle of its powers, the Ordinates
of the Circle BgL are the Lines of its Velocity, and
the Ordinates of the S-like Line BiF are the Lines of
time.</p>
            <p>Having thus shewed you how the Velocity of a
Spring may be computed, it will be easie to calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to what distance it will be able to shoot or throw
any body that is moved by it. And this must be done
by comparing the Velocity of the ascent of a body
thrown with the Velocity of the descent of Gravity,
allowance being also made for the Resistance and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
of the medium through which it passes.
For instance, suppose a Bow or Spring fixed at
16 foot above a Horizontal floor, which is near
the space that a heavy body from rest will descend
perpendicularly in a second of time. If a Spring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
the body in the Horizontal line with a Velocity
that moves it 16 foot in a second of time, then shall
it fall at 16 foot from the perpendicular point on the
floor over which it was delivered with such Velocity,
and by its motion shall describe in the Air or space
through which it passes, a Parabola. If the Spring be
bent to twice the former Tension, so as to deliver the
body with double the Velocity in a Horizontal Line,
that is, with a Velocity that moves 32 foot in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
then shall the body touch the floor in a point
very near at 32 foot from the aforesaid perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular
point, and the Line of the motion of the
body, so shot shall be moved in a Parabola, or a Line
very near it, I say very near it, by reason that the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107034:13"/>
Impediment of the medium doth hinder the exactness
of it. If it be delivered with treble, quadruple,
quintuple, sextuple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the first Velocity it shall
touch the floor at almost treble, quadruple, quintu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
sextuple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the first distance. I shall not need
to shew the reason why it is moved in a Parabola, it
having been sufficiently demonstrated long since by
many others.</p>
            <p>If the body be delivered by the Spring at the floor,
but shot by some Angle upwards, knowing withwhat
Velocity the same is moved when delivered, and with
what Inclination to the Perpendicular the same is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
and the true Velocity of a falling body, you
may easily know the length of the <hi>Jactus</hi> or shot, and
the time it will spend in passing that length.</p>
            <p>This is found by comparing the time of its ascent
with the time of the descent of heavy bodies. The as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
of any body is easily known by comparing its
Velocity with the Angle of Inclination.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>ab</hi> then in the fifth Figure represent 16 foot, or
the space descended by a heavy body in a second
minute of time. If a body be shot from <hi>b,</hi> in the Line
<hi>bf</hi> with a Velocity as much swifter than that equal
motion of 16 foot in a second, as this Line <hi>bf</hi> is longer
than <hi>ab</hi> the body shall fall at <hi>e;</hi> for in the same space
of time that the oblique equal motion would make
it ascend from <hi>bd</hi> to <hi>ac,</hi> will the accelerated direct
motion downward move it from <hi>ac</hi> to <hi>bd,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at the end of the space of one second, when the
motions do equal and balance each other, the body
must be in the same Horizontal Line in which it was at
first, but removed asunder by the space <hi>be,</hi> and for
the points it passeth through in all the intermediate
spaces this method will determine it.</p>
            <p>Let the Parallelogram <hi>abpq</hi> then represent
the whole Velocity of the ascent of a body by
an equal motion of 16 foot in a second, and
the Triangle <hi>pqr</hi> represent the whole Velocity
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107034:13"/>
of the accelerated descending motion, <hi>pb</hi> is then the
Velocity with which the body is shot, and <hi>p</hi> is the
point of rest where the power of Gravity begins to
work on the body and make it descend. Now draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lines parallel to <hi>aqr,</hi> as <hi>s tu, st</hi> gives the Velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the point <hi>t</hi> ascending, and <hi>tu</hi> the Velocity of
the same point <hi>t</hi> descending.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>pbst</hi> signifies the space ascended, and <hi>ptu</hi>
the space descended, so that subtracting the descent
from the ascent you have the height above the Line <hi>bd,</hi>
the consideration of this, and the equal progress for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
will give the intermediate Velocities, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the points of the Parabola.</p>
            <p>Now having the <hi>Jactus</hi> given by this Scheme or
Scale, appropriated to the particular Velocity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
any body is moved in this or that line of Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
it will be easie to find what Velocity in any
Inclination will throw it to any length; for in any
Inclination as the square of the Velocity thus found in
this Scale for any inclination is to the square of any
other Velocity, so is the distance found by this
Scale to the distance answering to the second Velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
            <p>I have not now time to inlarge upon this speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which would afford matter enough to fill a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,
by which all the difficulties about impressed
and received motions, and the Velocities and effects
resulting would be easily resolved.</p>
            <p>Nor have I now time to mention the great number
of uses that are and may be made of Springs in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick
contrivances, but shall only add, that of all
springy bodies there is none comparable to the Air for
the vastness of its power of extention and contracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Upon this Principle I remember to have seen
long since in <hi>Wadham</hi> Colledge, in the Garden of the
learned Dr. <hi>Wilkins,</hi> late Bishop of <hi>Chester,</hi> a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
so contrived as by the Spring of the included
Air to throw up to a great height a large and lasting
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107034:14"/>
stream of water: Which water was first forced into
the Leaden Cistern thereof by two force Pumps
which did alternately work, and so condense the Air
included into a small Room. The contrivance of
which Engine was not unknown to the Ancients, as
<hi>Hero</hi> in his <hi>Spiritalia</hi> does sufficiently manifest, nor
were they wanting in applying it to very good uses,
namely, for Engines for quenching fire: As <hi>Vitruvius</hi>
(by the help of the Ingenious Monsieur <hi>Claude Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raults</hi>
interpretation) hath acquainted us in the
Twelfth Chapter of his Tenth Book, where he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to describe <hi>Ctesibius</hi> his Engine for quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fire. Not long since a German here in <hi>England</hi>
hath added a further improvement thereof by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
the constant stream of water through Pipes
made of well tanned and liquored Leather, joyned
together to any convenient length by the help of
brazen Screws. By which the stream of water may
be conveyed to any convenient place through narrow
and otherwise inaccessible passages.</p>
            <p>The ingenious Dr. <hi>Denys Pappin</hi> hath added a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
improvement that may be made to this <hi>Ctesibian</hi>
Engine by a new and excellent contrivance of his own
for making of the forcing Syringe or Pump, which at
my desire he is pleased to communicate to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
by this following Description, which he sent me
some time since.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

                  <head>Dr. Pappins Letter containing a
Description of a Wind-Fountain, and
his own particular contrivance about the
forcer of its Syringe.</head>
                  <p>SInce the Artificial Fountain you have seen at
Mr. <hi>Boyles</hi> (which was of my making upon his
desire) hath been so pleasing to you as to make
you desire to see my description thereof, I cannot
doubt but the same will be as grateful also, and well
received by the Publick, especially when they shall
therein find a remedy for one of the greatest incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
of forcing Pumps, which are of so great
use for raising of water, and quenching of fires. This
was the occasion of my sending you this present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
which would not have been thus prolix
had it been only for your self.</p>
                  <p>In the Figure then AA is the Receptacle or body
of the Fountain careful sodered in all places, BB is
the Pump, CC the Plug or forcer, D a Pipe in the
middle of the Plug, which is perfectly shut and stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
when the Plate EE is forced down upon it, EE
is the Plate with a hole in the middle, upon which is
sodered a Pipe F, which serves for a handle to move
the Plug up and down.</p>
                  <p>G is a Cock at the top of the Pipe, which serves
to moderate the Jetto or stream.</p>
                  <p>HH is a Valve at the bottom of the Pump, which
openeth outward for the passage of the water out of
the Pump into the Fountain or Receptacle.</p>
                  <p>II is a Cross at the top of the Plug to hinder the
Plate EE from being drawn or separated too far
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107034:15"/>
from the hole D in working it to and fro.</p>
                  <p>KK are two Pins serving both to force down and
keep open the Valve HH.</p>
                  <p>LL are two Appendices sodered unto the top of
the Pipe FF, serving both for a handle to the Rod
of the forcer, and also to keep down the forcer.</p>
                  <p>MM are two other appendices or buttons fastned
at the top of the two small pillars NN, so as to turn
upon the same, and serve to hasp or button down the
ends LL of the handle of the forcer that it be not
driven up again.</p>
                  <p>OO is the Basin for receiving the water that falls
from the Jet or stream from which it may be forced
again into the Fountain or Receptacle.</p>
                  <p>For charging this Machine the Basin OO must first
be filled with water, and then the Pump must be
worked to and fro. In doing of which, when the
Plug is drawn upwards the water in the Basin runs in
through the cross (through which the Rod FF pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,)
where finding the hole D open it fills the spaces
of the bottom of the Pump; then the Pump being
thus filled, the Plug is to be forced downwards,
whereby the Plate EE being closely applied to the
brims of the hole D hinders the water from return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back again through the same, but is forced
through the valve HH into the Fountain AA. And
by repeating this operation all the water of the Basin
OO is easily forced into the aforesaid Fountain,
whereby all the Air that was therein contained is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
more or less according as more or less water is
forced in, and kept in that compression by the valve
H
H, which hinders the water that it cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
through the same.</p>
                  <p>But when you desire to have it return, you force
down the Plug hard against the bottom or plate,
which by the help of the aforesaid Pins or Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
KK force, and keep open the valve HH, and
the Rod F being kept fast down in this posture by the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107034:15"/>
aforesaid Buttons or Hasps MM, upon opening the
Cock G the water returneth through the valve HH,
so kept open, through the hole D, and through the
whole length of the Pipe F.</p>
                  <p>This way of putting a valve into the Plug of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
Pumps will be of great use for all such as serve
for supplying Towns with water, and for quenching
of fire, as preventing a great inconvenience to which
the common Pumps are usually subject from the Air
which is apt to be generated within them, which Air
upon working the said Pump remaining below the
forcer, and by its Expansion when the Plug is drawn
upwards, hindring the water from filling the whole
Cavity beneath it, and by its Condensation when the
Plug is forced downwards, losing a great part of the
strength of the force, much of the effect of the said
Machine is frustrated.</p>
                  <p>For preventing of which Inconvenience care is to
be taken that the water in all these forcing Pumps be
admitted by the top thereof as in the present Machine,
whereby whatever Air shall be generated below the
Plug, will readily rise into the hole D as being the
highest place next the Plate EE, from whence when
by the drawing up of the Plug the Plate is lifted from
the brims of the hole D the Air will readily slip up,
and the water as readily descend and fill all the
parts of the Pump below the Plug. As I have often
experimented in this present Machine.</p>
                  <p>Some Persons may object against these kind of
valves, assupposing the pressure of the water to be on
the wrong side thereof. But it is easie to be noted
that this objection is groundless, since it is the same
thing whether the Plate be pressed against the Rim
of the valve, or the Rim of the valve against the plate.
In common valves the Pressure of the water forceth
the Plate against the Rim: But in this the Rim against
the Plate; for the remaining solid Rim of the valve,
being made thrice as big as the hole or Cavity thereof,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107034:16"/>
the pressure of the water against that Rim forceth
the said Rim against the Plate in the middle three
times harder than if the pressure of the water lay
only on the plate of the value, the same would be pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
against the Rim.</p>

            <p>To this Discourse of an Artificial Fountain I
thought it not improper to add an ingenious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of M. <hi>James Young</hi> of <hi>Plimouth</hi> conteining his
own Observations and Opinion concerning natural
Fountains and Springs.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>HAving now gained time, from my other avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
I have drawn up those observations.
I told you I had made in my travels, which had
confirmed in me the opinion of my Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> that
Fountains and Springs were the Percolation of
the Sea; not (as your self, Mr. <hi>Ray, &amp;c.</hi> do assert)
from the rains descent into the Earth, I now repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
them to your consideration, rather as an Apology
(because they seem rational) to excuse, than Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to justifie and avow the presumption of my
dissent.</p>
                  <p>The first shall be the Phaenomena, I observed at
Isle <hi>de Mayo,</hi> which lieth in the Torrid Zone, about
thirteen degrees and 30 minutes, North from the
Equator. It's about six Leagues long, and four
broad, the wind bloweth constantly North East, or
thereabout, and without rain, except three weeks in
<hi>July,</hi> when it hath many showers; I here send you a
Map of the Island, as exactly as I could draw it. I
was there two Voyages, and each remained a full
month, the best part of which I spent in hunting, and
ranging the Island; there runneth through the middle
of it a Rivulet, of very pure water; It takes its rise
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107034:16"/>
from the bottom of two Hills, which lie on the North
East end; The stream at the place marked D, is about
fourteen foot wide and two deep; other than which
there is no fresh water on the whole Island, except
what our people dig out of the sand between the
Ocean and the salt Pond.</p>
                  <p>The said Pond is in a large Bay, at the West side
of the Island, which hath from one point to another
a bank of Sand, about two or three foot above water,
covering the Bay like a string to a Bow, the said bank
in the Flemish Road is about 150 foot wide, at the
English Road it is as broad again; there is never any
sensible ebbing or flowing of the Sea, only at full
Moons, or a day before. It riseth in high Billows,
which break over the Bank, at the North end of the
Pond, where it is lowest: By which means the Pond
is replenished with water, which condenseth into
Salt in two days.</p>
                  <p>The Sand dividing the said Pond and the Sea is
very fine and loose. Now because the before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Rivulet disembogues far from the Roads at an
inconvenient place for Boats, they are constrained to
dig Wells, in the midst of the bank of Sand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Pickle of the salt Pond and the Sea,
the manner thus: They first dig a pit about eight
foot deep, and therein lay two Hogsheads, the
one on the top of the other, the head out of both save
the lowermost of the deepest; the sides of both
are also full of Gimlet holes, and the sand laid
close to them: After twenty four hours they have
three or four foot of very clean water in them, which
being dipped out, you plainly see the new water
strain gently through those holes in the sides of the
Cask: After which, in a days time, one man attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, may draw about ten Hogsheads or more of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
a little tasting of Salt, not so much but that it is
drinkable, and very fit to boyl meat in, and is used
by those that come there to load Cattle, for their
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107034:17"/>
common drink. I have in the Map placed the Sign
O where our Well was made.</p>
                  <p>The next observations, pertinent to this subject I
made at the Island <hi>Lipari,</hi> near <hi>Sicily,</hi> about sixteen
Leagues from <hi>Messina;</hi> it is famous for the best Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins
in the <hi>Mediterranean;</hi> there is on it a large Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
a small Town, many Vineyards, and about one
hundred Families, besides some <hi>Religiose.</hi> I judge it
wants a fifth part of the bigness of the Isle <hi>de Mayo,</hi>
it is mostly very high Land, especially one Mountain,
on which stands a Watch Tower, whence a man may
see a monstrous distance at Sea, as is confirmed by <hi>de Ruyter.</hi>
In the relation he gives the States of <hi>Holland,</hi>
wherein he tells them, that from that place they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
the French Fleet's approach long before they
could from any other part, either of their own or
the other Island. I am sure it is much higher than
either that at the Isle <hi>de Mayo,</hi> or any I have seen in
<hi>England,</hi> and yet on this fair fruitful Island springs
not one drop of water, the Inhabitants storing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with rain, which falling very frequently, they
are careful to preserve in Cisterns, divers essays have
been made in the most promising part of it to find
Springs by digging Wells, one of those which I saw
was without doubt the deepest in <hi>Europe,</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
not the exact profundity as they related it, but I
have not forgot, that throwing in a stone it was
long ere it got to the bottom, and then returned
such a noise as it had been the discharge of a
Musquet.</p>
                  <p>The cause of this driness was by the people
thought to be subterranean heats, absuming the water,
but no such thing appearing, to the sense of those
that digged the Wells, I gave no faith to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion;
they fancy such heats partly from the want
of water, but mostly because the four adjacent
Islands, <hi>Stromboli, Vulcano, Vulcanella,</hi> and <hi>M. Aetna,</hi>
are constantly burning, and very near them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:107034:17"/>
The obvious earth of this place is loose, and in all
apparent qualities very good, but by the heaps that
had been thrown up, in digging the Wells, I saw the
inferiour earth was clammy, or like clay, that had
some greasie gummous matter commixed, This the
Religious told me was the very kind of Sulphur
which constantly boyled out of the burning Cranny
on <hi>Vulcanella;</hi> and wherewith all those Islands abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not excepting their own, though it were not yet
kindled.</p>
                  <p>For my third observation, I will go no farther than
the place of my present abode, <hi>Plimmouth,</hi> in which
on a kind of Piazza, commonly called the <hi>New-key,</hi>
(a plat of ground got in from the Sea) is a Well,
which (before the ever famous Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> by
cutting a Rivulet of thirty miles procured us water
in great plenty) was of common use, having (as at
this day) a Pump in it; about seven years since (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before the Key was inlarged) the Well was not
above eight foot from the edge thereof, over which
the Sea would frequently flow, when a high out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind
and a Spring Tide concurred, I say this Well,
though so near the Sea, yieldeth clean water, and as
sweet as a mixture of three parts fresh and one of salt
water would be. About an hundred yards from that,
on ground a little rising, is a very large Well, which
supplieth three or four Brew-houses, by whose drink
it is evident that the water hath not wholly quitted
its salt. It is to be noted, that <hi>Plimmouth</hi> lieth on a
Peninsula three miles long, and two broad, the Isth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
about two thirds of a mile wide, and not very
high from the surface of a full Sea. There are many
Wells in it, those near the Sea are saltish, those far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from it the less so.</p>
                  <p>My fourth observation I take from the late famous
French Traveller Monsieur <hi>Taverner,</hi> who in his first
Volume, discoursing of the Coast of <hi>Coromandel,</hi> &amp;c.
he saith they there want fresh water, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107034:18"/>
to make pits of two foot deep in the sand by
the Sea to find it.</p>
                  <p>The fifth observation, and which I would call the
most significant, were I assured of its truth, I had
from a very ingenious Chirurgeon, who had used the
<hi>West Indias,</hi> that there is in that Sea an Island called
<hi>Rotunda,</hi> of a figure agreeable to its name, which,
though very small, hath on it, arising in the middle,
a Spring of a very large stream of water, at which
our Ships frequently furnish themselves in their Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
he affirmed that it raineth there but once a
year, as at the Isle <hi>de Mayo;</hi> saying withal, that the
Island is so short of a proportion big enough for the
stream, that if it constantly rained, it could not be
supply enough to maintain so large an Efflux.</p>
                  <p>My sixth and last, is the relation of Dr. <hi>Downes</hi>
concerning <hi>Barbadoes, viz.</hi> that all their Springs were
formerly very near the Sea; that up in the Country
they supplied themselves from the rains by digging
pits in the earth, able to contain great quantities, and
there preserving it; which they did a very long time
(the rains being there as unfrequent as at the Isle <hi>de
Mayo)</hi> and that without any sensible diminution by
penetrating and descending into the earth; and to
prevent the loss thereof by the exhalations of the
Sun they covered it with leaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that now by
digging deeper they find Springs so plenty that no
Plantation is without one.</p>
                  <p>From all these observations the following consecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
do mechanically result.</p>
                  <p>From the first it appeareth that some Springs have
manifestly their source from the Sea; that sand swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
transcolated Sea-water, and that even pickle
strained through it loseth much of its saltness thereby,
all which is evident from the Well therein mentioned,
whose water could not possibly be other than what
soaked in from the Pond and the Ocean.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:107034:18"/>
Hence also is manifest, that constant and large
Fluxes of water may be made for eleventh months
without rain to refill the subterranean Cisterns, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by you to supply them; this appears from the
River running through the Island, by whose banks
I found (it being <hi>April</hi> when I was there, at which
time they had been ten months without rain) thsh
after their showers it could run but little larger that
it did after so tedious a want of them. I had forgot
to intimate in the relation, that those two Hommets,
A. are craggy Rocks, whereon live a great number
of Goats, and are consequently very unfit, if not
incapable, either to receive, or contain the Magazine
for the supply of the Rivulet.</p>
                  <p>From the second it is manifest, that higher Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of earth, and consequently more likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and contain sufficient quantity of rain-water to
beget and supply Springs and Rivers have not always
that effect, although there was one great advantage
more added here, <hi>viz.</hi> a clammy tyte earth in the
bottom to make the supposed Cistern the better able
to contain the store. I say, that frequent rain to fill,
high Mountains to contain, loose pervious earth to
receive, and a well luted bottom to support and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
(being all the qualifications and circumstances
supposed necessary to make and continue Springs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the modern Hypothesis) though all here
concurred, did notwithstanding fail of producing that
effect.</p>
                  <p>From the same it is also manifest, that where Springs
fail, without want of the causes that Hypothesis sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
necessary to produce them, the occasion hath
been from an apparent defect in the other (that is the
imperviousness of the earth through which the water
must pass before a Spring can be produced) both these
appeared at <hi>Lipary,</hi> where the general effect a Spring
or fountain was wanting, together with the causes
of our Hypothesis, though those of the other were
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107034:19"/>
manifestly existent, and with all the advantages ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary:
It seeming to me a very rational conjecture,
that the greasie clammy Sulphur, wherewith that
earth was impregnated, did by oppilating it hinder
the insinuation of the Sea into it.</p>
                  <p>From the third observation you have the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
confirmed, <hi>viz.</hi> That Springs are sometimes
manifestly from the Sea; That earth sweetens Sea-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by Percolation; And that the nearer Springs are
to the Sea, the more they retain of their pristine salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and lose it by sensible degrees, as they insinuate
farther through it.</p>
                  <p>By the fourth the same is confirmed.</p>
                  <p>The fifth proveth, that large streams flow without
any possibility of being supplied by rain, both for
want of such rain, and of dimensions to receive and
contain it.</p>
                  <p>The sixth doth evidence, that rain doth not pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
the Surface of the earth, even in a very dry
parched Country, and in the Torrid Zone, and yet
that Springs are under it, which at once proves ours,
and refutes the other opinion; the former appears by
the water in those made Ponds, lying there for a
long time without any sensible loss thereof by its leak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the earth: The later by the Wells near the
Sea, and those found since under that impervious
Land.</p>
                  <p>He that is not altogether a stranger to the weight,
pressure, and Elasticity of the air, the ascension of
liquors through Filters, and some other resembling
Phaenomena, would not account the like motion of
the transcolated water to high hills, to be an obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of any force against this Hypothesis, but sure
such solutions are no less beyond my ability than
design.</p>
                  <p>Finding I have Paper enough left, I will presume
to trouble you with one rare appearance more, that
occurred to one Mr. <hi>Brasey</hi> of this Town, an aged
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107034:19"/>
and very fat man, who by taking Spirit of Vitriol
in his mornings draughts (to which he was advised
as a remedy to asswage the exuberance of his belly)
found that it had no effect on his body; but that a
bundle of Keys, which he used to carry always about
him, and that wonted to be very smooth and bright,
of a sudden became black and rusty, though he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
handled the Spirit, nor carried it in his pocket, so
that we concurred in opinion that the sudorous Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via
of his body, impregnated with the Acid Spirit, had
occasioned it.</p>
                  <p>If so, It's very wonderful, that so small a quantity
thereof, when diluted with so much juice as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in such a corpulent man, should even insteam
and the insensible Emanations make impressions on
smooth Iron, mauger the perpetual attrition, by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
them in his Pocket, whereby such an effect
(one would think) should be prevented, or soon rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
of.—I was going to make some reflections on
this notable accident, but I consider, <hi>&amp;c.—</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:107034:20"/>THE Original of Springs is that which hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
the Pens of many learned Writers,
and very various have been the conjectures concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it. But amongst all I have met with I conceive
none more probable than that which seems to fetch its
original from the History of the Creation mentioned
in Holy Writ; that is, that there is a Magazine of
waters above as well as a Receptacle of waters upon
or beneath the Surface of the Earth: And that the
Air is that Firmament which separates between the
upper and lower waters, and between these two is
the circulation of waters (or bloud of the Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cosm,
if I may so call it) performed. The water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sometimes by a particular constitution of the Air
assisted by heat, rarified and separated into minuter
parts, and so reduced into the form of Air, and
thereby being divided into Particles really smaller
than those of the air in compassing, and agitated with
a greater degree of motion, they take up more space,
and so become lighter than the Ambient, and are
thereby elevated and protruded upwards till they
come to their place of poise or Equilibrium in the
Air; At other times by a differing constitution of
the Air and deficiency of heat they lose their agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and many of them again coalesce, and so having
less motion they condense and revert into water, and
so, being heavier than the incompassing Air, descend
down again to the Earth in Mists, Rain, Snow, Hail,
or the like.</p>
            <p>That there is such a Circulation I think there is none
doubts, but still it remains a difficulty (with those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that grant this) that all Rivers and Springs should
have their original from the water that falls or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
out of the Air.</p>
            <p>To persuade such persons it may not possibly be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>successful
to mention:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:107034:20"/>
First, That the great inundations or overflowing
of Rivers manifestly proceed either from the Rain
that immediately falls, or from the melting of Snow or
Ice that hath formerly fallen on the more eminent parts
of Mountains; to confirm which, Histories enough
might be brought were it necessary of <hi>Nilus, Niger,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That it hath been observed and compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that <hi>communibus annis &amp; locis;</hi> there falls water
enough from the Sky in actual Rain, Snow, or Hail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Surface of <hi>England</hi> to supply all the water that
runs back into the Sea by the Rivers, and also all that
may be supposed to evaporate; nay, though the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of the first be supposed twice as much as really it
is. This I have been assured by those that have both
experimented and calculated it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That there is not yet certainly (that I
know or have heard of) any other way of making
salt water fresh, but by Distillation; which, had there
been such an Art, it would in all probability have
been made use of, and so there is little probability that
the Springs at the top of a high Hill should proceed
from the Sea-water strained through the earth. But
were there such a filtration known I hinted in my At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
published <hi>anno</hi> 1660 about Filtration, how
somewhat of that kind might be explained.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That this Operation is constantly and
most certainly performed by Nature both in exhaling
and drawing up fresh steams and vapours from the Sea,
and all moyst bodies, and in precipitating them down
again in Rain, Snow, Hail, but of the other we have
no certainty.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I have observed in several places where a
Tree hath stood upon an high Hill, singly and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
at the brow of Box Hill near <hi>Darking</hi> in <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
that the body of the Tree is continually wet, and
at the root some quantity of water, which is always
soaking and gliding down from the Branches and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Tree, the leaves, sprigs, and branches of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107034:21"/>
the said trees collecting and condensing continually
the moyst part of the Air, the same being indeed a
true and lively representation of a River. Nor
has it been my observation alone, but the same is
mentioned by divers Authors: And it is affirmed
by some Authors, that there are some Islands in the
Torrid Zone which have no other water in them
than what is condensed out of the Air by the Trees
at the tops of the Hills, and converted into drops of
Rain.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, That it is generally observed, whereever
there are high Hills there are generally many Springs
round about the bottoms of them of very fresh and
clear water, and often times some which rise very
near the tops of them, which seems to proceed from
their great elevation above the other plain superficial
parts of the earth, whereby the Air being dashed
and broken against them, they help to condense the
vapours that are elevated into the higher and cooler
Regions of the Air, and so serve like Filtres to draw
down those vapours so condensed, and convey them
into the Valleys beneath, And hence it is very usual
in Countries where there are high Hills to see the tops
of them often covered with clouds and mists, when
it is clear and dry weather beneath in the Valleys.
And in the passing through those clouds on the top
I have very often found in them very thick mists and
small rain, whereas as soon as I have descended from
the higher into the lower parts of the Hills, none of
that mist or rain hath fallen there, though I could still
perceive the same mists to remain about the top. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
to this Observation was one related to me by
an ingenious Gentleman Mr. <hi>G. T.</hi> who out of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity
with other Gentlemen whilst he lived in the
Island of <hi>Teneriff,</hi> one of the <hi>Canaries</hi> made a journey
to the top of that prodigious high Mountain, called
the <hi>Pikc.</hi> The substance of which (to this purpose)
was, that the <hi>Caldera</hi> or hollow Cavity, at the very
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107034:21"/>
top thereof he observed to be very slabby and moyst,
and the earth to slip underneath his feet, being a very
moyst soft Clay or Lome like mortar. And farther,
that at a Cave, not far from the top, there was a
great quantity of very fresh water, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
supplied, though great quantities of Ice were
continually fetch'd from thence, and carried down
into the Island for cooling their Wines. Consonant
to which Observation was that which was related to
me by the Inquisitive Mr. <hi>Edmund Hally</hi> made in
St. <hi>Helena</hi> whilst he stayed there to observe the places
of the Stars of the Southern Hemisphere, in order to
perfect the Coelestial Globe. Having then placed
himself upon one of the highest Prominences of that
small Island, which he found to be no less than 3000
foot Perpendicularly above the Surface of the Sea
next adjoyning, supposing that might be the most
convenient place for his designed observation; He
quickly found his expectation much deceived as to
that purpose for which he chose it; for being gotten
so high into the Air the motion of it was so violent as
much to disturb his Instruments; but which was more,
he found such abundance of mists and moysture that
it unglued the Tubes, and covered his Glasses pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
with a Dew; and which was yet more, the
foggs and mists almost continually hindred the sight
of the Stars. But upon removing to a lower station
in the Island he was freed from the former Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences.</p>
            <p>I could relate many Histories of this nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it seems very probable, that not only Hills, but
Woods also, do very much contribute to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densing
of the moysture of the Air, and converting
it into water, and thereby to supply the Springs and
Rivulets with fresh water: And I am confident, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall consider his own observation of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and compare them with this Theory, will find
many arguments to confirm it. However, <hi>Nullius in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107034:22"/>
verba,</hi> Let Truth only prevail, and Theories signifie
no further than right reasoning from accurate Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
and Experiments doth confirm and agree with
them.</p>
            <p>Having thus delivered here somewhat of my own
thoughts concerning Springs and Rivers, finding
among some of my Papers a Relation, wherein a very
strange subterraneous Cistern is mentioned, I have
here subjoyned it as I received it from Mr. <hi>Thomas
Alcock</hi> from <hi>Bristol</hi> who together with Sir <hi>Humphry
Hooke</hi> was by whilst Captain <hi>Samuel Sturmy</hi> made this
inquiry, and who by interrogatories made to him,
penn'd this Relation for him as it follows ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>IN pursuance of His Majesties Commands to me at
the presenting of my <hi>Mariners Magazine,</hi> I have
with much diligence, some charge and peril endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to discover that great Concavity in the earth in <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestershire,</hi>
four miles from <hi>Kingrode,</hi> where His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
great Ships ride in the <hi>Severn.</hi> And I find by
experience that what has been reported of that place
is fabulous, whilst I thus describe it.</p>
                  <p>Upon the second of <hi>July</hi> 1669. I descended by
Ropes affixt at the top of an old Lead Oare
Pit, four Fathoms almost perpendicular, and from
thence three Fathoms more obliquely, between two
great Rocks, where I found the mouth of this spaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
place, from which a Mine-man and my self
lowerd our selves by Ropes twenty five Fathoms per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular,
into a very large place indeed, resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
to us the form of a Horse-shoo; for we stuck
lighted Candles all the way we went, to discover
what we could find remarkable; at length we came
to a River or great Water, which I found to be twenty
fathoms broad, and eight fathoms deep. The Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
would have perswaded me, that this River
Ebbed and Flowed, for that some ten fathoms above
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107034:22"/>
the place we now were in we found the water had
(sometime) been, but I proved the contrary by
staying there from three hours Floud to two hours
Ebb, in which time we found no alteration of this
River; besides, it's waters were fresh, sweet, and
cool, and the Surface of this water as it is now at
eight fathom deep, lies lower than the bottom of any
part of the <hi>Severn</hi> Sea near us, so that it can have no
community with it, and consequently neither flux nor
reflux, but in Winter and Summer, as all <hi>Stagna's,</hi>
Lakes, and Loughs (which I take this to be) has.
As we were walking by this River thirty two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms
under ground, we discovered a great hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in a Rock some thirty foot above us, so that I got
a Ladder down to us, and the Mine-man went up the
Ladder to that place, and walk'd into it about three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
and ten paces, till he just lost sight of me, and
from thence chearfully call'd to me, and told me, he
had found what he look'd for (a rich Mine;) but his
joy was presently changed into amazement, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
affrighted by the sight of an evil Spirit, which
we cannot perswade him but he saw, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
will go thither no more.</p>
                  <p>Here are abundance of strange places, the floor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and time had petrified.</p>
                  <p>After some hours stay there, we ascended without
much hurt, other than scratching our selves in divers
places by climing the sharp Rocks, but four days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
after my return from thence I was troubled
with an unusual and violent Headach, which I impute
to my being in that Vault. This is a true account of

Having given you a Relation of something very
low within the bowels of the Earth, I now shall add,</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>An account of a Iourney made to the highest part of the
earthby my Ingenious Friend Mr. G. T. as I collected
it out of the Memorials which he writ at the time of
making it; The particulars whereof were,</head>
               <p>THat <hi>August</hi> the twentieth, 1674. about Nine in the
morning, in company with Dr. <hi>Sebastian de
Franques,</hi> Mr. <hi>Christopher Prancis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot,</hi>
together with a Guide, and two other men with
horses to carry themselves and necessary provision for
the Journey, he set out from</p>
               <p>They passed up a Hill, which was very steep, till
they came to the <hi>Pinal</hi> or Wood of Pines. This
Wood lieth very high in the Island, and extendeth it
self from one end of the Island to the other, and is in
many places of a great Breadth, and is very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
covered with a <hi>Bruma,</hi> fog, or mist, which is so
thick as to darken and hinder the appearance of the
Sun through it, and so moyst as to make one wet in
passing through it.</p>
               <p>Through this Wood they rode by a pretty steep
ascent near two Leagues, crossing it till they came to
the further or <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap> side, where alighting they rested
themselves under a Pine, and Dined. And the fog,
which had accompanied them through the whole
Wood, here left them, and the Sun appeared.</p>
               <p>From hence they parted about one in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
and after an ascent of about half a mile of very
bad stony way they came to a sandy way, which for
about the length of a League was pretty plain; but
then they began to ascend a sandy hill, which for half
a League farther was pretty steep, which having
passed they arrived at the foot of the <hi>Pike.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here they alighted, and then rested themselves
for some time, then taking horse again, they began
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107034:23"/>
to ascend the <hi>Pike</hi> it self. This part of it was so
steep that the way up it is made by several turnings
and windings to and fro to ease and alleviate the
steepness of the ascent, which were otherwise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passable
for horses. All this part seems to be nothing
else but burnt stones and ashes, which may have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
tumbled down from the higher parts of the <hi>Pike.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this place they alighted, and unloaded their
horses of the Provision of Victual and water which
they were forced to carry with them for their own
accommodation, as also of the Provender for their
horses. And presently set themselves to provide
against the inconveniences of the ensuing night by
getting together in the first place a good quantity of
the wood of a small shrub, called <hi>Retamen,</hi> not much
unlike our English Broom, which grows there pretty
plentifully, and when dry burns very well; then, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
gotten wood enough, they endeavoured to shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
themselves against the piercing cold wind by heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up a wall of stones on the windward side, and
making a good fire of the dry shrubs they had collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to warm themselves.</p>
               <p>But so furious was the wind which came pouring
down from each side of the Mountain that it blew the
smoak and ashes into their eyes, and forced them
(though much to their Regret by reason of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
piercing coldness of the Air) to remove their
fire farther off. And to keep themselves as warm as
they could by lying down upon the ground very close
together. Thus they passed the night together as
well as they could, but with very little sleep, partly
by reason of the cold, and partly for the continual
expectation they had of the moment when their Guide
would call them to be mounting up the <hi>Pike,</hi> which is
usually about two or three hours before day, to the
end that they may get up to the top before the
rising of the Sun. For at the rising of the Sun
the Air is the most clear, and all the Islands of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107034:24"/>
the <hi>Canaries</hi> round about may be then plainly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>But at two a clock, when they should have been
on their Journey, the wind continued to blow with
such violence, that their Guide would by no means
venter to go up for fear least in the climbing up some
steep places the wind should encounter any of them,
and hurl them headlong down, so that they were
forced to continue and shelter themselves in their bad
Lodgings till the Sun arose, and had got some mastery
of the wind.</p>
               <p>About six a clock therefore they set forwards on
their enterprise, having first taken each of them his
dish of Chocolatte to fortifie their stomachs the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
against the cold, so with their Bottle of Strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water
in their Pockets, and Staves in their hands,
they began to mount the <hi>Pike,</hi> the way being just such
as they had passed the night before, but much more
steep, and continued on till they came to the <hi>Mal
pays,</hi> or stony way, which may be about half a mile
from the place where they lay; This stony way lieth
upon a very steep ascent, and is compounded of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of stones which lie hollow and loose, some of
them of a vast prodigious bigness, and others of them
smaller, in such manner as if they had been thrown
up there by some Earthquake, as the Author con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
with very great probability. In the clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
up these stones they took great care in placing
their steps on such of them as were more firm for fear
of slipping or tumbling so as to break their Legs or
Arms.</p>
               <p>With this difficulty they ascended till they came to
the Cave which he conjectures to be about three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of a mile distant from the beginning of the stony
way.</p>
               <p>At this Cave they found several persons who were
come thither to get out Ice to carry down into the
Island, some of which were below in the Cave,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107034:24"/>
digging Ice which was very thick, others remained
above. They found the mouth of the Cave about
three yards high, and two yards broad; and being all
of them desirous to descend into it, by a Rope fastned
about their bodies under their armpits they were all
one after another let down into it till they came to
set their feet upon the Ice, which is about sixteen or
eighteen foot from the mouth.</p>
               <p>The Cave is not very large, but full of water and
Ice, which at the time when they were there lay
about a foot under the Surface of the water, though
the men that usually go thither said that at other
times they found the Ice above the water, which
makes many to suppose that it ebbs and flows by means
of some secret entercourse that it may have with the
Sea, they averring that they have seen it emptying of
it self.</p>
               <p>But this Gentleman so soon as ever he came down
fixt his eye upon a stone that lay just above the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
of the water, and observed very diligently
but could not in all the space that he staid there, which
was half an hour, find it either increase or diminish,
which makes him believe that the fulness or emptiness
of the water may rather proceed from those thick
fogs and mists which are generally on the top, and
which hinder the <hi>Pike</hi> from being seen sometimes for
twenty, thirty, nay, forty days together; except only
just at the rising or setting of the Sun, though at some
other times it happens also that the Air is clearer, and
the <hi>Pike</hi> may be seen perhaps for a month together.
From these mists he conceives at some times much
water may be collected at the upper parts of the <hi>Pike,</hi>
and soaking down may not only supply, but increase
the water in the Cave; and consonant to this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis
he observed whilst he was there, that there was
a continual gleeting and dropping of water in six or
seven places from the sides of the Cave, which drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings
he supposes may be greater or less according as
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107034:25"/>
those fogs do more or less encompass it, or stay about
it a longer or shorter time; He judges also that there
may be some other more secret ways both for the
conveying water into and out of the said Cave than
those droppings, but supposes them to proceed from
the aforesaid fogs. Hence he concludes when the
Air is clear, and none of those fogs condensed about
the Hill, the water in the Cave must necessarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.
And that wich confirmed him the more in
this opinion was that when he came to the very top
of the <hi>Pike,</hi> he found the earth under him so very
moyst, that it was like mud or morter, and might be
made into Paste as by experiment he found which he
conjectures could no ways be caused by the wind or
clear Air, which is rather drying and consuming of
moisture, but must proceed from the fogs or mists
which are above the very top of the <hi>Pike.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He further took notice in the Cave that upon the
sides and top thereof there grew a snow-white furring
like Saltpeter, which had a kind of saltish taste, some
of which he gathered and brought back with him to
<hi>England</hi> to have it examined.</p>
               <p>After about half an hours stay in the Cave, which
they found warmer than without in the open Air,
they were all pulled up again, and proceeded forward
in their Journey by continuing to clamber up the stony
way, which lasted till they came to the foot of that
part of the Mountain which is called the Sugar-loaf,
by reason that at a distance from the Island it appears
of that shape, as it doth also even when you are at it.
The distance of this place from the Cave they judged
to be about half a mile, but the way much more
steep and ascending than the former part of the stony
way, and extreme troublesom to pass, their feet sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and slipping down again almost as much as they
could stride upwards, so that they concluded it the
most painful of all; however, persisting in their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
after many times resting themselves, they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107034:25"/>
gained the top, which they conceive might be about
half a mile higher.</p>
               <p>The very top they found not plain, but very
Rocky and uneven, and in the middle thereof a deep
hole; the outside of this top this Gentleman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
might be about a quarter of a mile round about
on the outside.</p>
               <p>This hole he conceived to be the mouth of a <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano</hi>
which hath formerly been in that place, for
even at that time whilst they were there much
smoak ascended out of several holes and chinks of
the Rocks, and the earth in divers parts was still so
very hot as to be very offensive to their feet through
their shooes, and he observed Brimstone thrown up
in several places, of which he collected some, and
brought back with him to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From this place may be seen in a clear day all the
six adjacent Islands, but the weather being then some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
thick and hazy, they could discover none but
the grand <hi>Canaries, Palm,</hi> and the <hi>Gomera,</hi> which
last, though distant near eight Leagues from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the <hi>Pike</hi> seemed yet so near unto them as if it
had been almost under them. The rest of the Islands
they could discover whereabout they lay by means of
a kind of white cloud hanging on them, but they
could not discern the Islands through those clouds.</p>
               <p>Here they tried their Cordial Waters which they
carried in their Pockets, but found them not to abate
of their usual strength, and become cold and insipid
as fair water, as several had positively averred to him
that they had found it, but he conceived them to be
very much of the same nature and strength that they
were of before they were carried up, which he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
to be by reason of their arriving at the top so
late.</p>
               <p>After they had stayed on the top about an hour,
and satisfied themselves in observing such things as
they were able, they descended again with very much
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107034:26"/>
facility, and came to the <hi>Stancia</hi> about eleven of the
clock, where they dined, and thence about one in the
Afternoon set forwards for the <hi>Villa,</hi> where they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
that afternoon about five that Evening.</p>
               <p>After their return they found their faces (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the heat of the Sun, and the parching subtil
wind) to cast their skins.</p>
               <p>He did not measure the Perpendicular height of the
Hill himself, but says that he hath been informed by
divers skilful Seamen, (who by their best observation
have taken the height of it) that it is between three
and four miles perpendicularly above the Sea.</p>
               <p>IN this Relation it is very remarkable:</p>
               <p>First, that this prodigious high Hill is the Product
of an Earthquake, and seems heretofore to have been
a <hi>Vulcano,</hi> or burning Mountain, like those of <hi>Aetna,
Vesuvius, Hecla,</hi> &amp;c. though at present it hath only
fire enough left to send forth some few sulphureous
fumes, and to make the earth of the <hi>Caldera</hi> or hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
pit at the very top thereof in some places almost
hot enough to burn their shooes that pass over it. And
possibly in succeeding Ages even this little fire may be
quite extinct, and then no other sign thereof may be
left but a prodigiously high Rock or spiring Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
which in tract of time may by degrees waste and
be diminished into a Hill of a more moderate height.</p>
               <p>Now as this Hill seems very evidently to be the
effect of an Earthquake, so I am apt to believe that
most, if not all, other Hills of the world whatever
may have been the same way generated. Nay, not
only all the Hills, but also the Land which appears
above the face of the waters. And for this I could
produce very many Histories and Arguments that
would make it seem very probable, but that I reserve
them in the Lectures which I read of this subject in
<hi>Gresham</hi> Colledge in the years 1664, and 1665.
which when I can have time to peruse I may publish</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:107034:26"/>
Therein I made it probable that most Islands have
been thrown up by some subterraneous Eruptions.
Such is the Island of <hi>Ascension,</hi> the <hi>Moluccas,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that most part of the Surface of the
Earth hath been since the Creation changed in its po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
and height in respect of the Sea, to wit, many
parts which are now dry Land, and lie above the Sea,
have been in former Ages covered with it; and
that many parts, which are now covered with the Sea,
were in former times dry Land. Mountains have
been sunk into Plains, and Plains have been raised
into Mountains.</p>
               <p>Of these by observations I have given instances,
and shewed that divers parts of <hi>England</hi> have in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times been covered with the Sea, there being
found at this day in the most Inland parts thereof suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
evidences to prove it, to wit, Shells of divers
sorts of Fishes, many of which yet remain of the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
substance, though others be found petrified and
converted into stone. Some of these are found raised
to the tops of the highest Mountains, others sunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the bottoms of the deepest Mines and Wells, nay,
in the very bowels of the Mountains and Quarries of
Stone. I have added also divers other instances to
prove the same thing of other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and
have manifested, not only that the lower and plainer
parts thereof have been under the Sea, but that even
the highest <hi>Alpine</hi> and <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains have run
the same fate. Many Instances of the like nature I have
also met with in Relations and observations made in
the <hi>East</hi> as well as in the <hi>West Indies,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of all which strange occurrences I can conceive no
cause more probable than Earthquakes and subterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Eruptions which Histories do sufficiently assure
us have changed Sea into Land, and Land into Sea,
Vales into Mountains sometimes, into Lakes and
Abysses at other times; and the contrary—unless we
may be allowed to suppose that the water or fluid
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107034:27"/>
part of the earth which covered the whole at first,
and afterward the greatest part thereof, might in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ages and long process of time be wasted, by being
first raised into the Atmosphere in vapours, and thence
by the diurnal, but principally by the annual motion
thereof be lost into the <hi>aether,</hi> or medium through
which it passes, somewhat like that wasting which I
have observed to be in Comets, and have noted it in
my <hi>Cometa:</hi> Or unless we may be allowed to suppose
that this fluid part is wasted by the petrifaction and
fixation of such parts of it as have fallen on the Land
and Hills, and never returned to fill up the measure of
the Sea, out of which it was exhaled, for which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much may be said to make it probable that the
water of the earth is this way daily diminished.</p>
               <p>Or unless (since we are ascertained by observations
that the direction of the Axis of the earth is changed,
and grown nearer the Polar Star than formerly; that
the Magnetism or Magnetical Poles are varied, and do
daily move from the places where they lately were,
and that there are other great and noted changes ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
in the earth) we may be allowed to conceive
that the Central point of the attractive or gravitating
power of the earth hath in long process of time been
changed and removed also farther from us towards
our Antipodes, whence would follow a recess
of the waters from these parts of the world to those,
and an appearance of many parts above the surface of
the water in the form of Islands, and of other places
formerly above the Sea now in the form of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
so to continue till by the libration or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
returning motion thereof it repossess its former
seat and place, and overwhelms again all those places
which in the interim had been dry and uncovered with
the return of the same water, since nothing in nature
is found exempt from the state of change and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:107034:27"/>
Further, it is probable that Earthquakes may have
been much more frequent in former Ages than they
have been in these latter, the consideration of which
will possibly make this Assertion not so Paradoxical as
at first hearing it may seem to be; though even these
latter Ages have not been wholly barren of Instances
of the being and effects of them, to convince you of
which I have hereunto subjoyned a Relation and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of one very newly which hapned in the Isle of
<hi>Palma</hi> among the <hi>Canaries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, the clearness of the Air is very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which made an Island which lay eight Leagues
off to look as if it were close by. To this purpose
I have often taken notice of the great difference there
is between the Air very near the lower Surface of the
Earth, and that which is at a good distance from it;
That which is very near the earth being generally so
thick and opacous that bodies cannot at any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
distance be seen distinctly through it: But the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the eye and object are elevated above this thick
Air, the more clear do the objects appear. And I
have divers times taken notice that the same object
seen from the top and bottom of a high Tower hath
appeared twice as far off when seen at the bottom as
when seen at the top: For the Eye doth very much
judge of the distance of Objects according as the
Density of the Air between the Eye and Object doth
represent them. Hence I have seen men look of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantick
bigness in a fog, caused by reason that the
Fog made the Eye judge the Object much farther off
than really it was, when at the same time the visible
Angle altered not. This great thickness of the lower
Air is sufficiently manifest in the Coelestial bodies, few
of the fixt Stars or smaller Planets. being visible
till they are a considerable way raised above the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third remark about the moistness of the fogs,
and the production of water at that height I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107034:28"/>
insisted on. Only the almost continual fogs that
this Gentleman observed in the Wood they passed is
very remarkable for the origine of Springs.</p>
               <p>Nor shall I say any thing concerning the vast per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
height of the same, but for a close of this
present collection I shall add the short account of the
Eruption which lately hapned in the <hi>Palma.</hi>

of an hour after Sun-set hapned a shaking or
Earthquake in the Island of St. <hi>Michael de la Palma,</hi>
one of the <hi>Canary</hi> Islands, from the lower <hi>Pyrenna,</hi>
and within a League of the City unto the Port of
<hi>Tassacorte,</hi> which is accounted thirteen Leagues distant
along the Coast, but more especially at or about a
place called <hi>Fuencaliente,</hi> being seven Leagues from
the Town to the Southwards. The trembling of the
earth was observed to be more frequent and violent
than elsewhere, and so it continued till <hi>Wednesday</hi>
the 17. <hi>ditto.</hi> The People thereabouts were much
affrighted, for besides the Earthquake there was often
heard a thundring noise as in the bowels of the earth
on a Plain called the <hi>Canios,</hi> which is before you come
to the great descent towards the Sea, where the hot
Baths stand, or the holy Fountain; likewise at the
ascent from the aforesaid Plain upwards at the great
and wearisom Hill, called <hi>Cuesta Cansada,</hi> and until the
Mountain of <hi>Goatyards,</hi> and the same day in and about
the said places mentioned, the Earth began to open
several mouths, the greatest of them upon the said
<hi>Goat</hi> Mountain, being distant from the Sea a mile and
an half, and from the said opening came forth a very
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107034:28"/>
great heat and smell of Brimstone; and the same day, an
hour before Sun-set at one of the mouths of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risom
Hill was a trembling thereabout with more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
than any of the four days before; and a great and
black smoak came forth with a terrible thundring noise,
opening a very wide mouth, and throwing out much
fire, with melted Rocks and stones; and immediately
after at another place eighty paces below hapned the
like terrible noise and sight, and in less than a quarter
of an hour after there opened to the quantity of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
mouths towards the foot of the said Mountains,
and there issued out fire, melted Rocks, and other bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
matter from all the said mouths, and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
formed into a great River of fire, which took its
course over the first mentioned Plain, slowly going
down towards the said holy Fountain; but it pleased
God, being come within eight spaces of the Brink of
the said great descent, it turned a little on the right
side, and took its course with a very great fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the old Port, which is that which was first
entred by the Spaniards when they took the
Islands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friday</hi> the nineteenth at two a clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
in the aforesaid Mountain of Goats, on the other
side of <hi>Tassacorte,</hi> there opened another mouth
with much smoak and stones of fire, and so closed
again. But the next day (the twentieth) it began
again to smoak, and continued with great trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
and noise in the bowels of the Earth until
<hi>Sunday</hi> the twenty first at noon, when with many
flashings of fire, and a greater thundring noise it
finished that opening of that monstrous birth, cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up into the Air both fire and stones, and at night
the smoak ceasing, the thundring noise, fire and stones
increased, forcing great fiery stones so high into the
Air as we lost sight of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with such violence
sent them upwards that according to the best judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they were five times longer in falling down,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107034:29"/>
which stones or Rocks were observed to be bigger
than a Hogshead,; and what was most to be admired
was, that these breaking in the Air, and changing into
many several shapes, distinctly appearing, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
did reunite again in falling down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Munday</hi> the twenty second it began again to cast
forth black smoak for two hours time, and after to
thunder, and throw up fire and stones with great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
<hi>Tuesday</hi> the twenty third at noon it smoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
again, and from thence until night there was terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thundring noise, and casting up of fire and stones
more fierce than before; and about nine of the clock
at night a very great trembling of the earth was felt,
and presently after followed three great stones of fire
in the form of Globes which were forced about half a
League in height, and then like Granadoes broke in
the Air with very great noise. <hi>Wednesday</hi> the twenty
fourth it was for an hours time very quiet, and
after it began with greater force than ever before,
by reason that some of the lower and first mouths
were partly stopt, with which the aforesaid River
of fire ceased from running, after it had dammed up
the Bay of the old Port, with burnt and melted
Rocks and Stones, and other matter wherewith the
said River had run, and had forced the Sea back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
above a Musquet shot at random, and near twice
as much in breadth. It ran into the Sea above sixty
paces. What fell into the Sea went congealing with
a great smoak, what came after, forced and ran
over that which went before, so that the smoak was
very great many paces within the Sea, as far as seven
fathoms depth, which caused many men to imagine
that some such like <hi>Vulcano</hi> had opened under the
Sea in the said seven fathoms depth. This night it
cast up some stones like great fiery Globes as the
former.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thursday</hi> the twenty fifth it proved yet more
violent than ever with thundring noise and flashes of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107034:29"/>
fire. <hi>Friday</hi> the twenty sixth, the mouth that was
at the foot of the Mountain began again to cast up as
much fire and stones as ever, and formed two other
Rivers; the one taking its course to Leeward of the first
River leading toward the Rocks called <hi>de los Tacosos;</hi>
and the other took its way to windward of the first, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
towards the Bathes or Holy Fountain; and in
this entrance the mouth of the Monntain was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be more quiet, though it cast up much ashes
like black small sand. What dammage appears to
have been done from its beginning to this day the
twenty sixth of <hi>November,</hi> being of thirteen days con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
hath been about nine or ten Country
Houses burnt, besides Out-houses, and great Cisterns
for water, which are the poor Peoples only Remedy
in those parts, and upwards of three hundred Acres
of ground are quite spoiled, being covered with
Rocks, Stones, and other Rubbish and Sand; and
if, (which God defend) the said <hi>Vulcano</hi> do longer
continue, the damage must be far greater, especially
if any other mouth should break out higher, as it is
much feared, by reason the earth in some places doth
open with appearances as at first, so that all about that
circuit of the <hi>Fuencalliente</hi> will be lost; and for what
already hapned, and yet continues with much terrour,
besides the fears of more in other parts thereabout,
the Inhabitants do leave their Habitations, and like
poor distressed people seek relief at the City, and
many leave the Island to seek their fortunes in the
others.</p>
               <p>From the twenty sixth of <hi>November,</hi> that the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Relation was sent for <hi>Teneriff</hi> by the Chamber of
this Island unto the General, the said <hi>Vulcano</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
fierce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and without ceasing, rather more
than less, with a terrible thundring noise, casting up
Fire, Stones, Rocks, and black Ashes, and the three
Rivers of Fire still running into the Sea, and hath
now dammed up all the Baths and holy Fountain, to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:107034:30"/>
the great detriment of the Island, that yearly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a great benefit thereby, besides many damages
dayly added to the former. Several other mouths
have since opened in the like dreadful manner near
about the same place, we see the great smoak by
day, and hear the thunder and noise, like the shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off of many Cannons, and by night see also much
of the fire very high in the Air from this City, which
