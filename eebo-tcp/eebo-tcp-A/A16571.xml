            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to apply thoſe ſtudies, which per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tained more to the miniſterye of gods church. In the which, with what vehemens and force he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored, it is euident by this: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the firſt yere of his comimng thether, he obteined degree of ſchole, and was made maiſter of art, &amp; gatte the fauour and admiration of all men, that by and by he was choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> felowe of Penbrooke hall, where he ſo daily profited, by a certayn heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly dexterite of his wit, that as he was had in eſtimacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all good men: ſo alſo he began to be welbeloued of Martin Bucer, which hoped of no ſmall fruit to procede, from that his ſo godlye diſpoſicion. wherefore he counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, to beſtow his giftes and talent, to the common profyte of inſtructynge Chriſtes flock.

Neyther was his purpoſe diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, for as ſone as Bradford ſtode forth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> middeſt: al the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multe was eaſilye appeaſed, &amp; the people at the firſt ſight of him, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed him lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g helth, crying Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde Bradforde god preſerue thy life Bradford.

attencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei heard him entreat of quiet &amp; chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obedience. Finally after his ſermond ended: the moſt part of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> went quietlye &amp; peaſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly home to their houſes. In the meane time amonge the reſidew which reſiſted (for it could not bee that in ſo great offence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, al thinges could ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be quieted) there was a certayn ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tleman with his two ſeruants, whiche comming vp the pulpytte ſtaires ruſhed againſt the doore, deſyring to enter vpon Bourn, I know not what he minded.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenes he willingly perfourmed, that is to ſaie he couered him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde with his gowne, till by the Maior and the Sherifes, he was ſafely brought into Poules ſcole. On this wiſe the railing preacher againſt king Edward, by Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordes helpe eſcaped death, which for his raylinge he had deſerued, whiche thing thei whiche woulde haue bene reuenged of him, dyd not diſſemble, for one of them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly

<pb facs="tcp:17085:15"/>
that he hath doone more hurte by letters, and exhortinge theſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue come to him, in religion, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer he did when he was abrode by preachinge.

ſo I humbly beſeche your honors to conſider, that you ſit in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſight of the lord: who as Dauid doeth witneſſe is in the congregacions of iudges, and fittes in the myd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iudgeing. And as you woulde youre place, to bee nowe of vs taken as gods place: ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate your ſelues, to folowe hym in your ſittyng, that is: ſeke no giltleſſe bloude, nor hunte not by queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to bring into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſnare, them whiche are out of the ſame. At this preſente I ſtande before you, giltie or giltleſſe: if giltie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> procede and geue ſentence accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinglye, if giltles, then geue me the benefite of a ſubiect, whiche hitherto I could not haue. Heare the Lorde Chauncellour replyed and ſaide, that the ſaid Bradford began with a true ſentence: <hi>Deus ſtetit
<pb facs="tcp:17085:22"/>
in ſinagoga.</hi> &amp;c. but, ꝙ he, this and all thy geſture, declareth but Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and vain glory. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he made much a do to purge himſelf, that he ſought no giltles bloud, and ſo beganne a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, howe that Brodfordes facte at Poules croſſe, was preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous arrogant, and declared a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, to lead the people. whiche coulde not, but tourne to much diſquietnes, ꝙ he, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou, ſpeaki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to Bradford, was ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fract and ſtout in religion, at that preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which as thou waſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> committed to priſon, ſo hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to haſte thou bene kepte in priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where thou haſte written letters to no litle hurte to the Queenes people, as by the reporte of therle of Darby in the parlement houſe, was credeblye reported. And to
<pb facs="tcp:17085:23"/>
this be added, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſaid Bradford did ſtubbernly behaue himſelf, the laſt time he was before them, and therfore not for any other thynge now I demaund thee of (ꝙ he) but of &amp; for thy doctrine &amp; religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Mi lord (ꝙ Bradforde) where you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me of hipocriſy &amp; vain glory, I muſt &amp; wil leaue it to the lordes declaracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which one daie wil o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen yours &amp; my trueth: &amp; heartye dealinges. In the meane ſeaſon I wil conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t my ſelf, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of mine own conſcience. Which if it yelded to hipocriſy, could not but haue god my foe alſo, and ſo both god and man were agaynſt me. As for my facte at Poules croſſe, and behauior before you at the Towre, I doubt not but god wyll reuele it to my comfort. For if euer I dydde any thynge
<pb facs="tcp:17085:23"/>
which god vſed to publyke bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, I think that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my dede was one: and yet for it I haue beene &amp; am kept of lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time in priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And as for letters &amp; religion I anſwer (ꝙ Bradforde) as I did the laſte tyme I was beefore you. There diddeſte thou ſaye (ꝙ my Lorde Chauncellour) that thou wouldſt ſtubbernli &amp; manly maintein ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ronious doctrine in ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Edwardz daies. My lorde (ꝙ Bradforde) I ſaid the laſt time I was before you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I had .6. times taken an othe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſhould neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing of any Iuriſdiccion on the biſhop of Rome his behalfe, and therefore durſte not aunſwere to any thynge ſhoulde be demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo, leaſt I ſhould be forſworn, whiche God forbid. Howe bee it ſauyng myne othe, I ſaid that I
<pb facs="tcp:17085:24"/>
was more confirmed in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine ſet forth publike in ki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes daies, then euer I was, before I was put in priſone, and ſo I thought I ſhould be, &amp; think yet ſtyll I ſhall bee founde more ready to geue my lyfe, as god wil, for the confirmacion of theſame. I remember wel (ꝙ my lord Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour) that thou madeſt muche a doe about a nedeles matter, as though the othe againſt the B. of Rome wer, ſo great a matter. So others haue done before thee, but yet not in ſuche ſorte as thou haſt done. For thou pretendiſt a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in it, whiche is nothinge els but mere hipocriſie. My conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ꝙ Bradforde, is knowen to the Lorde, and whether I deale here in hipocritally or no, he knoweth. As I ſaide therfore then my lord,
<pb facs="tcp:17085:24"/>
ꝙ he ſo ſaye I againe nowe, that for feare leſt I ſhould be periured I dare not make anſwere to any thyng, you ſhal demaunde of me, yf my aunſweryng ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent, to the practyſing of any iuriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion for the .B. of Rome, here in England. Why, ꝙ my lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour, diddeſt thou not begin to tel, that we ar <hi>Dii</hi> and ſit in gods place, and nowe wilte thou not make vs aunſwere? My lorde, ꝙ Bradforde, I ſayde you woulde haue your place take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vs now, as goddes place, and therefore I brought foorth that pece of ſcryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye mighte be the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed to folowe God and his wayes at this preſente, who ſeeth vs all, and well perceyueth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of conſcience I pretende thys matter of the othe or no. No, ꝙ my
<pb facs="tcp:17085:25"/>
my lord Chancelor, al men may ſe thi hipocriſy: for, if for thine othes ſake thou doeſt not aunſwere, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wouldeſt thou not haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as thou didſt, &amp; haue aunſwered me at the firſt. But now me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may wel perceiue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this is but a ſtartynge hole to hide thy ſelfe in, becauſe thou dareſt not aunſwere, and ſo wouldeſt eſcape, bli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple peoples eies, as though of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience you did all you doe. That whiche I ſpake at the firſte (ꝙ Bradforde) was not a replicacy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or an aunſwere to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you ſpake to me, &amp; therfore I nede not to lay for me myne othe: for I thought, perchance you would haue more weyed what I did ſpeak, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you did. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I perceued you did not conſidre it, but came to aſke matter whereto by anſwerynge I ſhoulde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the practiſinge of
<pb facs="tcp:17085:25"/>
iuriſdiccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the B. of Rome hys behalf here in Englande &amp; ſo bee forſworne: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience &amp; ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie I ſpake as I do yet again ſpeak, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I dare not for conſcience ſake anſwere you, and therfore I ſeke no ſtartinge holes, nor goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to blind the people, as God knoweth. For if you of youre ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſhal tel me, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you doe not aſke me any thyng, wherby my anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſhould conſent to the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> B. of Romes iuriſdiccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſke me wherin you wil, and you ſhal here, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I will aunſwere you as flatly as euer anye did y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> came before you. I am not afrayde of death I thanke god, for I loke, &amp; haue loked for nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g els at your hands of long time. But I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth. I ſhould haue mater to trouble my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<pb facs="tcp:17085:26"/>
by the giltines of periury, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe aunſwer as I do. Theſe be but gaye glorious woordes, ꝙ my lorde Chauncelour, ful of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and vaine glory. And yet doeſt not thou knowe, ꝙ he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to Bradforde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſit here as B. of Wincheſter in mine own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oces, and therefore maye doe this whiche I doe, and more too? My lord, ꝙ Bradforde, geue me leaue to aſke you this queſtion, that my conſcience maie bee out of doubte in this matter. Tel me here <hi>coram deo</hi> before god, all this audyence beyng witnes, that you demaund me nothing, wherby my aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſhould conſent to &amp; confirme the practiſe of iuriſdiccion for the B. of Rome here in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: and your honour ſhall heare me, geue you as flat and as plain anſwers
<pb facs="tcp:17085:26"/>
briefly, to whatſoeuer you ſhal de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maund me: as euer any dyd. Here the lorde Chauncellor was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, and ſpake much, howe that the B. of Romes auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, nede no confirmacion of Bradfordes aunſweringe, nor no ſuche as he was. And turned hys talke to the people, howe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde followed craftye couetous marchauntes: which, becauſe thei woulde lende no money to theyr neighbors, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei wer in nede: would ſay, that they had ſworne ofte, they would neuer lende anye more money, becauſe their credy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours had ſo ofte deceiued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo thou (ꝙ he to Bradford) doſt at this preſent, to caſte a miſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peoples eyes, to bleare them with an hereſie, which is greatter, and more hurtful to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth,
<pb facs="tcp:17085:27"/>
pretende thine othe, whereby the people mighte make a conſcience where as they ſhoulde not. Why ſpeakeſt thou not? quoth he. My lord (ꝙ Bradford, as I ſaid I ſay agayne, I dare not anſwere you for feare of periury, from whiche God defende me: Or els I could tell you, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene othes. Some be according to faith and charitie, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> othe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the B. of Rome. Some be agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt faith and charitie, as this, to denye my help to my brother in his nede. Here again y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor was much offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, ſtil ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Bradford durſt not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: and further made muche a do to proue, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> othe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> B. of Rome was againſt charitie. But Bradford anſwered, that how ſo euer hrs honor toke him, yet was
<pb facs="tcp:17085:27"/>
he, aſſured of his meani<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, that no feare but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feare of periury made him aferd to aunſwere. For as for death my lord (ꝙ he) as I knowe ther ar .12. houres in the day, ſo w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord my time is appointed. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhalbe his good tyme, then ſhall I departe hence. But in the meane ſeaſon, ꝙ he, I am ſafe y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough though al the worlde had ſworne my death. Into his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des I haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted it, his good will be done. And, ꝙ Bradford, ſaui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g mine oth, I wil anſwer you in this behalf, that the othe agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt the. B of Rome was not nor is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt charitie. Howe proue you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, ꝙ my lord Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>celor. Forſoth, ꝙ Bradford, I proue it thus: That is not againſt charitie, whiche is not againſt gods worde: but this othe againſt the biſhop of Romes
<pb facs="tcp:17085:28"/>
aucthoritie in Englande is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt gods worde, therefore it is not againſt charitie. Is it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt gods woorde, ꝙ my Lorde Chancellour, that a man ſhoulde take a kyng, to be ſupreme heade of the church in his realme? No ꝙ Bradford (ſauing ſtyl mine othe) it is not againſt gods worde, but with it, being taken in ſuche ſence as it may be wel taken: that is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to the kinges power, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſoueraintie in all his dominions. I praye you, ꝙ the lorde Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour, where finde you that? I finde it in manye places, ꝙ Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde, but ſpecially in the .13. to the Romaines, where Saint Paule writeth: euery ſoule to be obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the ſuperiour power. But what power? <hi>que gladium geſtat,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power verely which beareth the ſweord,
<pb facs="tcp:17085:28"/>
which is not the ſpiritual but the temporall power: As Chriſoſtome full well noteth (ꝙ Bradforde) v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſame place, whiche youre honor knoweth better then I. He (Chriſoſtome I meane) ther plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſheweth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> biſhops, prophetes, and apoſtles owe obedience to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> temporall maieſtrates. Here yet more the Lorde Chancelour was ſtered and ſaid, howe that Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde went about, to deny al obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Queene, for his oth, &amp; ſo (ꝙ he) this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> woulde make, gods woord a warrant of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. For he will aunſwere the Queene on this ſorte, that when ſhe ſayeth nowe ſweare to the B. of Rome, or obey his aucthoritye. No, wil he ſaie, for I am then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworne, and ſo make the Queene
<pb facs="tcp:17085:29"/>
no Queene. No (ꝙ Bradforde) I go not about to deny all obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the Queenes highnes, by deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng obedience in this part, yf ſhee ſhoulde demaunde it. For I was ſworne to king Edward, not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: that is, not onely concernyng his owne perſon, but alſo concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his ſucceſſours. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in denying to do the Quenes requeſt herein, I denye not her au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, nor become diſhobedient. Yes, that doeſt thou (ꝙ my Lorde Chancelor.) And ſo he beganne to tell a longe tale, howe if a manne ſhoulde make an othe to pay a .Cli. by ſuch a day, and the manne to whom it was due, would forgeue the debt. The debter woulde ſaie, no, you cannot do it, for I am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. &amp;c. Here Bradford de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſired my lord Chauncellor, not to
<pb facs="tcp:17085:29"/>
trifle it, ſaying: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wondred, hys honor would make ſolemne othes (made to god) trifles in that ſorte. And make ſo great a matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vowes as thei cal it, made to the biſhop for mariage of prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes. At theſe wordes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour was much offended, &amp; ſaid he did not trifle, but (ꝙ he) thou goeſt about to denie obedience to the Queene, which now requireth obedience to the B. of Rome. No my lord (ꝙ Bradford) I dooe not denye obedience to the Queene, yf you would diſcerne betwene <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>ſpecies.</hi> Becauſe I may not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey in this, to reaſon, <hi>ergo</hi> I maye not obey in the other, is not firme. As if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let one ſel a pece of his inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, yet this notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng al his inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is not let or ſold. And ſo in this caſe, all obedyence
<pb facs="tcp:17085:30"/>
I denye not becauſe I denie obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in this branche. I wil none of thoſe ſimilitudes ſaid the lorde Chancellour. I would not vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (ꝙ Bradforde) if that you wente not about to perſwade y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, I meane that which I neuer me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For I my ſelf, not onely meane o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, but wil geue enſample<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of all moſt humble obedience to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Queenes highnes, ſo long as ſhe requireth not obedience agaynſte god. No no (ꝙ my lorde Chaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour) al men maie perceiue wel i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough your meaning. There is no man, though he bee ſworne to the king, doth therfore break his othe, yf afterwardes he be ſworne to the Frenche king and to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. It is true my Lorde (ꝙ Bradforde) but the caſes bee not like. For here is an excepcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: thou
<pb facs="tcp:17085:30"/>
ſhalt not ſweare to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>. B. of Rome at any time. If in like maner we were ſworne, thou ſhalt not ſerue themperour &amp;c. you ſee there were ſome alteracion and more doubt. But (ꝙ Bradford) I beſeche your honour, remembre what ye youre ſelfe haue written, anſweringe the obieccions here againſt, in youre boke <hi>de vera obedientia. Vincat mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do domini verbi veritas.</hi> Let Gods woorde and the reaſons thereof beare the bell awaie. Heare the lord Chauncelor was throughlye moued, and ſaide ſtyll, howe that Bradforde had written ſedicious letters, and peruerted the people thereby, and did ſtoutly ſtand, as though he would defende the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious doctrine in kynge Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes tyme, againſt all men, &amp; now (ꝙ he) he ſaieth, he dare not
<pb facs="tcp:17085:31"/>
anſwer. I haue written no ſedici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous letters (ꝙ Bradforde) I haue not peruerted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people. But that which I haue writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wil I neuer deny by gods grace.

At whiche wordes Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde ſpake thus: My Lorde, ꝙ he, I praye you ſtretche out your gentlenes, that I maye fele it, for hytherto I neuer felte it.

After the lorde Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor had ended his longe oracion, Bradforde began to ſpeak thus. As yeſterday I beſought your ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nour, to ſet in your ſighte the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie and preſence of God, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him which ſeketh not to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the ſimple by ſubtil queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: ſo, quoth he, I humblye beſeche e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of you to daie, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you knowe that giltles bloud wil crie vengeaunce.

<pb facs="tcp:17085:35"/>
nature is ſo much corrupt that we are very obliuious and forgetfull of god. Again, ꝙ Bradford, as ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdaie I pretended my othe and othes againſte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> B. of Rome, that I ſhould neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing of any iuriſdiccion for him, or in his behalfe in the realme of Englande: ſo againe this day leſt I ſhould be periured.

And this I do that when death, whiche I loke for at youre handes, ſhall come: I ſhall not be troubled with the giltines of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury. At theſe words y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor was wroth, &amp; ſaid that they had geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him reſpite to deliberate vntil this day, whether he would

Oh what an hereſye is thys? Here good people ye may ſee what a Churliſhe hereticke thys felowe is.

<pb facs="tcp:17085:37"/>
he capciouſly aſking of Bradford often anſwer of things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning othes, which Bradford would not geue ſimply, but with diſtinccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherat the lord Chancelour was ſore offended. But Bradford ſtyll kept him at the baye: that the oth againſte the B. of Rome, was an vnlawfull othe, vſing therto, the Chancelors owne boke de <hi>Vera o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedientia</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For confirmacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: at the length thei came to this iſſue, who ſhould iudge of the lawfulnes of of the othes. And Bradford ſaid, the worde of God, accordynge to Chriſtes owne woordes. Iohn .12. ſaying: My word ſhal iudge. And according to the teſtimonie of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſai .2. &amp; Micheas .4. That goddes word coming out of Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal geue ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce amongſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gentiles. By theſe wordes my lord ꝙ he, I
<pb facs="tcp:17085:37"/>
will proue the othe againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> B. of Romes auctorite, to be a good, a godli, &amp; a lawful oth. So therof the lord Chauncelor left his hold, ſayi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other day he p<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded denyal of the Queenes aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie &amp; obedience to her highneſſe: ſo did he now. But Bradford, as the day before proued, that obedience in this point are particuler to the Quenes highnes. If ſhe ſhold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de an othe to the .B. of Rome beinge denied, it was a generall deniall of her aucthoritie and obe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dience to her, no more (quoth he) then the gift or leaſe of a ſole pece of a mans inheritance proueth, a ſale, gift, or leaſe of the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. And thus muche a doe was made about the matter. The lord Chancelor talking muche, &amp; vſing many examples of dette, of
<pb facs="tcp:17085:38"/>
going out of the towne to morow by othe, yet tarying tyll Fridaye &amp; ſuche like, whiche triflinge talke Bradford did touche, ſaying, that it was a wonder, that his honour did wey co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience no more in this, and would be ſo earneſt in vowes for mariage of Prieſtes, made to biſhops, and bee careleſſe for So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne othes made to God and the prince. <hi>Summa</hi> this was the ende, the lorde Chauncelour ſayde, the Queene might diſpence with it: &amp; did it to al the whole realme. But Bradford ſaid, the Queenes high<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, could do no more but remitte her right. And as for the oth made to God, ſhe coulde neuer remytte. For as muche as it was made to God. At which woordes the lord Chancelour chafed wonderfully, and ſaid that in plaine ſentence he
<pb facs="tcp:17085:38"/>
ſlandered the hole realme of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury: and therfore (ꝙ he) to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, you may ſe how this felow ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vppon hym, to haue more knowledge &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, then al the wiſe men of England, &amp; yet (ꝙ he) he hath no conſcience at al.

ſpeake to the people, vpon whoſe wordes I commyng in to the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit: had like to haue bene ſlaine w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a naked dagger, which was hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at me, I thinke, for it touched my ſleaue.

And yet (ꝙ Bradford) notwithſtanding, I did in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, reproue their fact, &amp; called it ſedicion, at the leaſt .xx. tymes. For all whiche my doinge, I haue receiued this recompence, priſon a

Let al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (ꝙ Bradford) nowe iudge, wher con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is. In ſpeking theſe words: ther was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deuored to haue let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, but Bradford ſpake on, &amp; let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeake what they would. And the lord Chancelour ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for al his faire talke his fact at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Croſſe was naught. No (ꝙ Bradford) my fact was good, as you youre ſelfe did bear witnes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> me. For when I was firſt before you in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Towre you your ſelfe did ſaye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the facte was good, but, ꝙ you, the mynde was euyll, wel then ꝙ I, my lord, in that you alowe my facte &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne my mynde in it, I can not otherwiſe declare my mynd to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by ſaying &amp; doi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, god, I truſt, one day will open to my comforte what my mynde was, and what

Here the lord Chaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour was offended &amp; ſaide, that he neuer ſaid ſo, I (ꝙ hee) had not ſo litle wit, I trow, as not to diſcerne betwixt meaning &amp; doyng, and ſo brought forth, litle to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purpoſe, many examples, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſtrue thynges, not by the meanynge of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but by their doings.

Here my lord Chauncelour &amp; M.

My lord (ꝙ Bradford) as I ſayde at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt, I ſpake nothinge of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which you allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, &amp; therfore reꝓued it not, nor gaue me no time to deliberate. Why (ꝙ he) diddeſt thou not denye Chriſts preſence in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? No (ꝙ Bradford) I neuer denyed nor taught, but that to the fayth, whole Chriſts body &amp; bloud was as preſente, as breade &amp; wyne to the dewe receyuer. yea, but doeſt thou not beleue that Chriſtes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye naturallye and reallye is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the forme of bread and wyne? My Lord (ꝙ Bradforde) I beleue Chriſt is preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t there, to faith of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dewe receyuer, as for tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanciacion, I plainely and flatlye
<pb facs="tcp:17085:43"/>
tell you I beleue it not. Here was Bradford called a deuil or ſclande<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rer for we axe no queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ꝙ y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord Chancelor, of tranſubſtanciacion, but of Chriſts bodily preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Why quoth Bradford, I denye not hys preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the faith of the receuer, but denye that he is included in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bred, or that the bred is tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanciated, If he be not i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded ꝙ the B. of Worceſter, how is he then preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? Forſothe (quoth Bradford) my faith knoweth howe, though my to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g cannot expreſſe it, nor you otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by faith heare it or vnderſtand it. Heare was much a doe now, one Docter ſtarting vp &amp; ſpeking this, another that, &amp; the lord Chancelor talking muche, of Luther, zwi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>glius, &amp; Oecola<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>padiꝰ. But ſtil Bradford kept the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at this point, that Chriſt is preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to faith
<pb facs="tcp:17085:43"/>
and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is no tranſubſtancia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion nor including of Chriſt in the bread, but al this would not ſerue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfore an other biſhop aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man receiued Chriſtes verye bodie or no? &amp; Bradford anſwered plainly, no. Where the lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor made a long oracion, howe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it could not be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſte was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, excepte that the euill man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But Bradford put his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racion away in few woordes: that grace was at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſent offred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his lordſhip, although he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it not. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, ꝙ he, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> receyuing maketh not the preſens as youre lordſhip would affirme, but gods grace, trueth, &amp; power, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of the preſence, the which the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> lacketh faith cannot receue. And here Bradforde prayed hym
<pb facs="tcp:17085:44"/>
not to deuorce that, whiche God hathe coupled together, he hathe coupled al this together: take eate this is my bodye, he ſaieth not ſee pepe, this is my bodye, but take eate. Here the lorde Chancelour &amp; the reſte of the Biſhoppes made a great a do, that Bradforde hadde founde out a toy, that no man els euer did, of the condicions, &amp; the lord Chancelor made many words to the people, here aboute. But Bradford ſaid this, My lord ꝙ he, are not theſe woordes take eate, a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement? and are not theſe woordes, this is my bodye a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſe? If you wil challenge the ꝓ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, &amp; do not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, may you not deceue your ſelf? Here the lord Chancelor denied Chriſte to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded any thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſe of it. Why, ꝙ Bradford
<pb facs="tcp:17085:44"/>
my lord I pray you tel the people, what mode <hi>accipite manducate</hi> is, it is plain to childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Chriſt in ſo ſaying co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth. At theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, the lorde Chauncellor made a great toying &amp; trifling at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratiue mode, &amp; fel to propoſing or examining as though he ſhuld teach a child, &amp; ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded that it was no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, but ſuch a phraſe as this, I praye you geue me drink which is no commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t I trow. But Bradford prayd him to leaue toying &amp; trifling and ſaid thus: my lord, ꝙ he, if it be not a commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſt to take &amp; to eate the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, why do any take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund &amp; make of neceſſity, that which god leueth free? as you do in making it a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that once a yere for al that be of lawful diſcre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion
<pb facs="tcp:17085:45"/>
to receiue the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Here the lord Chancelour calleth him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine <hi>Diabolus</hi> or ſlaunderer, &amp; ſo began out of theſe woordes,<note place="margin">Cori. 10.</note> let a man proue himſelf &amp; ſo eate of the bread (the bred ꝙ Bradford?) and drink of the cup, that was no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for then, ꝙ he, if it wer a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it ſhould bynde al men in al places, &amp; at al tymes. O my lord, quoth Bradford, diſcerne betwene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandementes, ſome be generall that thei binde alwaies in all places and all perſones, ſome be not ſo generall as this is of the ſupper: The ſacramente of Baptiſm: of the appearing before the lord at Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring Iſaac. Here the lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor ſaid, what ſay you that Bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſme is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, quoth he, we ſhal haue .xi. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandementes.
<pb facs="tcp:17085:45"/>
In dede, quoth Bradford, I think you thinke as you ſpeake, for els you would not take the cup from the people, ſeyng y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſte ſayeth, drink of it al. But howe ſaye you my lord quoth, Bradford, Chriſte ſayth to you biſhops ſpecially, <hi>ite predicate euangelium,</hi> goe &amp; preache the goſpel, fede Chriſtes flocke, is this a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement or not. Here was the lord Chancelor in a great chafe &amp; ſaid as pleaſed him. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I wene the B. of Durham, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him when Chriſt began to bee preſent in the ſacrament, whether before the receyuer receiued it or no? Bradforde anſwered that the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was curious, &amp; not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, &amp; further ſaid as the ſaid cup was the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſo the bred was Chriſts body: to him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth it duely. But yet ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bred
<pb facs="tcp:17085:46"/>
is bred, for in al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture ye ſhal not find this propoſicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>non eſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> ther is no bred, &amp; ſo he brought forth ſ.

Loe (ꝙ the lord Chancelor) this felowe is now in a nother hereſy of fatal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteny, as though all thynges wer ſo tyed together, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of mere neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie al thinges muſt come to paſſe. But Bradford praide him to take things as they were ſpoken, &amp; not wreſte them into a contrary ſence. your lordſhippe (quoth hee) doth diſcerne betwixt god and manne, things are not by fortune to god at any time, thoughe to man they ſeme ſo ſome times.

wherof was that I did ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully (quod he) behaue my ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the lorde Chauncelour &amp; the other Biſhoppes the other daye, that euen the verieſte enemies I had did ſee, howe that they had no matter againſte me: therefore aduiſed me, as thoughe it came of his own good wil without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king anye other man priuie or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anye other procuringe hym, as he ſaid, that I would this daye (for quoth he anone you ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before them again) deſire ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tyme &amp; men to conferre with al.

hys cappe, &amp; out ſtretched he his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, and on this ſort he ſpake to me, that bycauſe he perceaued I was deſyrous to conferre withe ſome lerned man, therfore he had broughte maiſter Archedeacone Harpſfeld to me, and quoth he, I tell you, you doo like a wiſe man, but I praye you goe roundlye to worke, for the tyme is but ſhort: my Lorde, quoth I, as rounde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyl as I can I wyll go to woorke with you, I neuer deſired to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with anye man nor yet doo, howbeit if you will haue anye to talke with me I am redy to heare and aunſwere hym. What quoth my Lord of London in a fume to the keper: did not you tell me that this man deſired conference? No my Lorde quoth he. I tolde you that he wold not refuſe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferre
<pb facs="tcp:17085:53"/>
with any, but I did not ſhewe to anye that it was his deſire. well quoth my Lord of London, mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Bradforde you are welbelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, I pray you conſider your ſelf and refuſe not charitie when it is offered. In dede my Lord quoth I, this is finale charitte, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne a man, as you haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned me, whiche neuer brake the lawes, In Turckie a man may haue tought free, but in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland I cold not fynd it, for I am condempned for my faith ſo ſone as I vttered it at your requeſte, before I had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted any thing againſte the lawes. As for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, I am not afrayed (quoth I) to talke with whome you will, but to ſaye that I deſire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre: that do I not. Well well quoth my Lorde of London, and
<pb facs="tcp:17085:53"/>
ſo called for maiſter Taylor, and I went my waye.</p>
            <p>Vpon the 4. of Februarie came one of my lord Chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cellors gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen, ſent as he ſaid fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my lord as then being come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the court. Thys was about .8. of the clocke the eueninge. The effecte &amp; ende of his talke &amp; meſſage was, that my Lorde his maiſter did loue me well, and therefore he offered me tyme to conferre if I woulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, but as I had aunſwered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in this matter, ſo I aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, that I wold neuer make that ſute, but quoth I, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferre with any, I will neuer refuſe: by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am certaine and able I thancke god, to defend by godlye learning, my faith. Thus with much a doo we ſhoke hands, and departed, he to his maiſter, and I
<pb facs="tcp:17085:54"/>
to my pryſon.</p>
            <p>Vpon the 7. of Februarie came one maiſter Wollerton a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine to the Biſhoppe of Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>don to conferre with me: Who, when he perceaued that I deſired not his comming, beinge as one moſt certain of my doctrine. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wiſhed rather his departing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abiding: well maiſter Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford quoth he, yet I pray you let vs conferre a litle, perchance you may do me good, if I can dooe you none. Vpon whiche wordes I was content to talke. He ſpake muche of the doctors and fathers, of the bread in the .6. chapiter of Iohn. And ſo wolde proue tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiation: &amp; howe that wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do receiue Chriſts bodie. And I on the contrarie parte impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his aucthours, with much by
<pb facs="tcp:17085:54"/>
talke betwixte vs bothe, and the keper, who toke his parte litle to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purpoſe. Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma to this iſſue we came, that he ſhould draw out of the ſcriptures and doctours, his reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And I wold peruſe them, and if I could not aunſwere the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I would giue place. And ſo I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to do my reaſons, which I woulde make, and ſo departed for that daye.</p>
            <p>The next day following in the morning, he ſent me halfe a ſhete of paper written on bothe ſides, with no reſons how he gathered his doctrine, but onlye the bare ſentence: <hi>Panis quem ego dabo</hi>: The bread whiche I wil giue is my fleſhe. And the places in the 26. of Matth. 14. of Marke .22. of Luke, &amp; the .10. and .11. to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. with ſome ſentences of the

doctors, all which made as much againſt him, as with hym al only one of Theophilactꝰ except in the after nowne he came himſelf, and then we had a longe bablynge to none effecte, and at the lenght he came to the church, and how that I ſhwarued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the churche.

Why quoth he, it is not profitable to haue the ſeruice in Engliſhe, and ſo he brought forth this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to proue it. <hi>Labia Sacerdotis cuſtodiant, legem.</hi> The lipes of the prieſtes ſhould kepe the law, and out of his mouth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt loke for knowledge.

But muſt we, quoth I, lerne all at the prieſtes? yea quoth he, well then ſaid I, I ſee you would bringe the people to hange vppe Chriſt and let Barrabas goo,<note place="margin">Luk. 23</note> as the prieſtes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did perſwade the people. A which wordes he was ſo offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: that he had no luſte to talke any more. Summa I gaue hym the reaſons. I had gathered againſt tranſubſtantiacion, and prayed hym to frame his in the
<pb facs="tcp:17085:56"/>
frame of reaſons, and I woulde aunſwere them, well quoth he, I wil do ſo, but firſt I wil anſwere yours. The whiche thing he hath not done hitherto, nor wil not: for I heare that he is ridden into the Country.</p>
            <p>Vpon the .12. of Februarye there came one of the Erle of Darby his men called Stephen Beiche, one of olde acquentaunce to me: who ſhowed me, that my lord ſent him to me, and willed me to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my ſelfe, &amp; he would be good lord vnto me. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I aunſwered, that I thancked his lordſhipppe for his good will towardes me, but quoth I, in this caſe I cane not te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der my ſelfe more then gods honour: then he ſet before me, my mother, my ſiſters, frends, kyndſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes, &amp; Country, what a greate diſcomforte it wolde be vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

And ſo he tellinge me, that my death would doo much hurte, and ſuch lyke talke: we ſhoke handes. Howbeit, nowe I remember that in oure talke he aſked me, if my lord ſhould obtaine for me, that I might departe the Realme: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I would not be content to be at the Quenes appointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, wher ſhe woulde appointe me beyond the ſea?

But, quoth I, good Perceiuall. I am to ſure ſetteled, for beinge moued in thes mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

            <p>Vppon the .15. of Februarie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout .4. of the clocke in the after nowne, cometh Percyuall Creſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, and the other man waytyng vpon maiſter Harpſfeld<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon of Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who after ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle ſalutation, and many formalities beganne a longe oracion. Howe that all men, euen the Infideles, Turckes, Iewes, Anabaptiſtes, and Libertines, deſire felicitie, as well as the chriſtians. And howe that euerye man thyncketh they ſhal attaine to it, by their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. To the whiche longe oracion I aunſwerred briefly: that he ſpake not farre a miſe. Then goeth he on, yea, but the waye, quoth he, thither is not all a like. And ſo he ſet furth, how infideles by Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Iuno, The Mahumet by
<pb facs="tcp:17085:59"/>
his Alcoran, the Iewe by his Thalmud: beleued to come to Heauen. For ſo manye I ſpake ſayth he: as beleue the immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the ſoule. And this long or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acion, I as brieflie aunſwered: and ſaide he had ſpoken truelye. Well then, quoth he, here is the matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the waye to this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. we maye not inuente anye newe waye. Their is but one waye, quoth I, and that is Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte, as he hymſelfe doth witneſſe: I am the waye, here Maiſter Harpſfeld affirmed and denyed, and further ſayde, that I ment by Chriſte, beleuing in Chriſte, I haue lerned, quoth I, to diſcerne betwixte Faythe and Chryſte. Albeit I confeſſe that who ſo euer beleuethe in Chriſte the ſame ſhalbe ſaued.
<pb facs="tcp:17085:60"/>
No, quoth he, not all that beleue in Chriſt, for ſome wyll ſaye, lord Lorde, haue not we caſte oute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilles &amp;c? But Chriſte will ſay in the daye of iudgement to thoſe departe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, I knowe you not. yea ſyr, quoth I, you muſte make a difference, betwixte beleuing &amp; ſaying. I beleue, as for example, if one ſhould ſay and ſwere he loued you: for all his ſaying you wil not beleue him, when you ſee he goeth aboute to vtter, and doo all euyll thinges againſte you. wel quoth he, this is not muche materiall. Theire is but one waye Chriſte. How come we to know him, where ſhal we ſeke to finde him? Forſoth quoth I, we muſt ſeke hym by his word, and in his word, &amp; after his word. Verye good quoth maiſter Harpſfeld. But tell me now, howe
<pb facs="tcp:17085:60"/>
firſt we come into the companie of them that could tell vs this, but by Baptiſme. True, quoth I, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme is the ſacrament, by the whiche exteriorlye we are inſert and engraf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e into Chriſte, for I dare not, quoth I, exclude oute of Chriſte, al that dye without bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, I wil not tye God where he is not bound. Some infants dye: whoſe parents deſire baptiſme for them, and maye not haue it. To thoſe, quoth he, we maye thincke perchaunce ſome mercie God will ſhew. yea, quoth I. thoſe infants whoſe parentes doo conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pne bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſme, wil not I contempne vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, becauſe the childe ſhall not beare the fathers offence. Well quoth he, we agree that by baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me then we are broughte, and (as one would ſay) begotten of chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:17085:61"/>
for chriſte is oure father, and the churche his ſpouſe is our mother, as al men naturallie haue Adam for their father, and eue for theyr mother, ſo all ſpirituall men haue Chriſt for their father, &amp; the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che for their mother, whiche chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che. As Eue was taken out of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams ſide: ſo was ſhe of Chriſtes ſide, where out flowed bloud, for ſatiſfaction &amp; purging of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Al this is true, quoth I, and godlye ſpoken. Nowe then, quoth he, tel me whether this churche of Chriſte hathe not ben alwayies: yes, quoth I, ſithen the creacion of man, and ſhalbe for euer. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good, quoth he. But yet tel me, wether this churche is not a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Chuſche, or no: yes (quoth I) that it is, howbeit none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe viſible, then Chriſte was
<pb facs="tcp:17085:61"/>
here on earthe. That is no exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior pompe or ſhewe, ſetteth her forth commonlye. And therfore to ſee her we muſte put on ſuch eyes: as good men put one, to ſee and knowe Chriſte: when he walked here one earthe. For as Eue was of the ſame ſubſtaunce, Adam was of: ſo is the churche of the ſame ſubſtaunce, Chriſte is of. I meane fleſhe of fleſhe, and bone of hys bones, as Paule ſayeth, Ephe. 5. Looke therefore howe Chriſte was viſible knowen to be Chriſte, when he was on earthe: (that is by conſidering him after the word of God) ſo is the church knowen. I do not come to reaſon, ſaith he, at this preſent, &amp; therfore I wil go on forward. Is not this a multitude? yes (ꝙ I) that it is.<note place="margin">Virgi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Well, quoth he, I perceaue you haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and by a litle perceaue the more.

Wel, I meane it ſo, quoth he. Tel me yet more, hath it not the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, quoth I, howbeit the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie therof is often letted? But I wil put you of your purpoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſee where about you goo. If heretickes haue baptized and doo baptize, as they did in ſainct Cyprians time: you knowe thys baptiſme is baptiſme, and not to be reiterated. This I ſpeake, that the ſtaunders by might ſee, that thoughe the poptſhe church haue baptiſme, whiche we receaue of them: yet therefore is it not the true churche: nor neuer neade we to be baptized again. which thing he ſawe well ynoughe: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaid, I went fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, addynge, that I had more er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, then one, or two. So ye ſay, quoth I: but that is not ynough,
<pb facs="tcp:17085:63"/>
till you proue them. Well, quoth he, this churche is a multitude, hath the preaching of the goſpell and the miniſtracion of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and yet more, hath it not the power of iuriſdiction? Oh ſir, quoth I, whether goo you, you walke not wililey, ynough you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not deceaue me (I thancke god): what iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is exerciſed in ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of ꝑſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And here he made muche adoo, to proue that this, was an eſſenciall point. you ſaye true, quoth I. For if this poi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fale you: all the church you go about to ſet forthe, will fall downe. you ſhal not fynd in all the ſcripture,
<pb facs="tcp:17085:63"/>
this is eſſentiall pointe of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Byſhoppes, quoth I. In Chriſtes churche Antechriſt will ſitt. And Peter telleth vs, as it wente in the olde churche afore Chriſtes comming: ſo will it be in the newe churche, ſithen Chriſtes comming. That is, as their were falſe Prophetes &amp; ſuche as bare rule were aduerſaries to the true Prophetes: ſo ſhal there be ſithen Chriſtes comming falſe teachers, euen as of ſuch as be byſhoppes, and beare rule amonges the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. you alwayes goo out of the matter, quoth he. But I wil ꝓue (ſaeth he) the ſucceſſion of Byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppes. Doo ſo, quoth I. Tel me quoth he, were not the Apoſtles byſhoppes? No, quoth I, excepte you will make a newe definition of Biſhoppes, that is, giue no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein

Therefore the like we muſte loke for nowe. Why, quoth be, I can gether, and proue you ſucceſſion in Ieruſalem of the high prieſtes. From Aarons time, I graunte, quoth he, but not ſuche ſucceſſion as allowed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth. Why, quoth
<pb facs="tcp:17085:68"/>
he, did they not all allow Moyſes lawe: yes, quoth I. And kept it, for the bokes therof, as you do the Bible and holy ſcripture: but the interpretacion and meaning of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they did corrupte, as I take it you haue done. And therfore the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions they ſtirred vp againſt the Prophetes &amp; Chriſte, was not for the lawe, but for the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion of it, as you ſaie nowe: that we muſt haue the interpretacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſcriptures, at your ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des. but to make an ende, quoth I, death I do loke daily for, yea, hourely, &amp; I thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke my time be but very ſhort. Therfore I had neade to ſpend in praier, as much tyme with god as I can, (whileſte I haue it) for his helpe and comforte. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I praye you beare with me, that I do not more plainlye, and
<pb facs="tcp:17085:68"/>
in more woordes, aunſwere you longe talke. If I ſawe death not ſo nere me as it is, I woulde then weye euery peice of your oracion: (if you would giue me the ſome of them,) &amp; I would aunſwere them, accordinglie I hope. But bicauſe I dare not, nor I wil not leaue of, lokinge and prouidinge for that whiche is at hande: I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to holde me excuſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I doo as I do. And I har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telye thancke you, for youre gentle good will. I ſhall harte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye praye GOD oure father, to giue you the ſame lyght and lyfe, as I wiſhe to my ſelfe. And ſo I beganne as to riſe vppe. But then maiſter Harpſfeld beganne to tell me, that I was in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye perillous caſe, and he was ſorie to ſee me ſo ſetteled. Telling
<pb facs="tcp:17085:69"/>
further, that in dede he could tell me nothinge, whether death were fare of or nere. But that forceth not, quoth he: ſo that you did dye well. Well quoth I? yes. For I doubte not in this caſe, but to dye wel. For as I hope and am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, my deathe ſhall pleaſe the Lord: ſo I truſt, I ſhall dye cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullye, to the comforte of his chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. yea, but what if you be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, quoth he: what quoth I, if you dyd ſaye the Sone did not ſhyne nowe. Then it did ſhine tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>roughe the wyndowe where wee ſatt, wel, quoth he, I am ſorrie to ſee you ſo ſecure and careleſſe. In dede quoth I, I am more careleſe &amp; ſecure, carnallie, then I ſhoulde be, God make me more vigilant. But in this caſe, quoth I, I can not be to ſecure, for I am moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
<pb facs="tcp:17085:69"/>
I am in the truth. That are ye not, quoth he, for you are not of the Catholike church. No, quoth I? thoughe you haue excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate me: yet am I in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church of Chriſte, and wil be a child of it, and an obediedt child for euer.

How you beleue, quoth I, you knowe: for my parte I confeſſe a preſence of hole Chriſte, God, and man, to the the fayth of the receauour. No, quoth he, you muſte beleue a Reall preſence in the ſacrament. In the ſacramente, quoth I? No I will not ſhute hym vppe, nor tye hym to it, otherwiſe then faithe ſee the and permitteth. If I woulde include Chriſtes reall preſence in the ſacrament, or tye
<pb facs="tcp:17085:71"/>
hym to it otherwiſe, then to the Fayth of the receauer: then the wycked man ſhoalde receiue him, whiche I do not, nor will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue by goddes grace. More pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, quoth he: but a man maye ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelye ſee you make no preſence at all, and therefore you agree not therein with vs. I make a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, quoth I, and a true preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: but to the fayth of the receauer. What, quoth one, that ſtode by, of Chriſtes verie bodie whiche died for vs, yea, quoth I, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of whole Chriſte: God, and man, to the faythe of hym that receaueth it. why, quoth maiſter Harpſfeld, this is nothing els, but to exclude the omnipotencie of God, and all kynde of myracle in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. No, ꝙ I, I do not exclude his omnipotencie, but you rather
<pb facs="tcp:17085:72"/>
doo it. For I beleue that Chriſte can accompliſhe his promiſe, the ſubſtaunce of bread and wine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge their ſtill: as well as the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents. And, quoth I, I counte it a greate miracle: that common bread ſhoulde be made a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al bread, that is, a bread ordeined of God, not for the foode of the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dye, but rather for the foode of the ſoule. For when we come to the ſacrament, we come not feade our bodies, and therfore we haue but a litle peice of bred: but we come to feade our ſoules by faith, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che the wicked waunte: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they receaue nothynge but <hi>Panem Domini</hi> as Iudas did, and <hi>Panem Dominum,</hi> as the other the Apoſtles did. The wicked, ſaithe maiſter Harpſfeld, do receiue the verie bodie of Chriſte, but not the
<pb facs="tcp:17085:72"/>
grace of his bodie. No, quoth I, they receaue not the body, for it is no dead carkaſe. He y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> receaueth it: receiueth the ſpirite, whiche is not with out grace I wyne. Wel, quoth he, you haue very many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. you counte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Maſſe for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominacion, and yet ſaint Abroſſe ſaide maſſe. And ſo red oute of a boke written, a ſentence of ſainct Ambroſe to ꝓue it. Why, ſir, quod I, the maſſe, as it is now, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge ſo in ſaint Ambroſe tyme. was not the moſt perte of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, made ſithen by Gregorius, &amp; Scolaſticus, and others. In ded, quoth he, a greate peice, of it was made as ye ſaye, by Gregorius, but Scholaſticꝰ was before S. Ambroſe tyme. I wene not, quoth I, howbeit I wyll not contend. Saint Gregorie ſaith, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles

ſaid maſſe, with out Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, onely with the lords praier. you ſaye true, quoth he, for the Canon is not the greateſte parte of the maſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The greateſt part, is the ſacrifice, eleuacion, tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiacion and adoracion. I can awaye with none of thoſe, quoth I, No I thincke the ſame, quoth he. But yet <hi>Hoc facite</hi> telleth plain lye the ſacrifice of the churce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you conſider not well, quoth I, this worde ſacrifice, not diſcernynge betwixte the ſacrifice of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, and the ſacrifice for the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che. The ſacrifice of the Churche, is no propitiatorie ſacrifice: but a gratulatorie ſacrifice. The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice Chriſte hym ſelf offered: is the propitiatorie ſacrifice. And as for your <hi>Hoc facite</hi> is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to anye ſacrifyinge: but
<pb facs="tcp:17085:73"/>
to the whole action, takynge, eatynge. you ſpeake nowe, quoth he, not learnedlye, for Chryſte made his ſupper, onelye to the .12. not admittinge his mother, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſeuentie diſciples to it. Nowe the Apoſtles doo ſignifie the prieſtes.

If I could do you good, quoth he, I woulde be right glad, either in ſoule or body for you are in a perellous caſe both waies. Sir, quoth I, I tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ck you for your good wil. My cauſe is as it is: I thancke God it was neuer ſo wel with me: for death to me ſhall be life I truſte and hope in god.

deſire any bodie to ſewe for tyme for me, I neuer wil do it by godes helpe. For I am not wauerynge, nor I would not that anye bodye ſhould thincke, I were ſo. But if you haue the charitie and loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes me, you pretend, and ther to doo thincke that I am in an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: I thincke the ſame ſhoulde moue you to doo, as you woulde be done by: as you thincke of me: ſo do I of you, that you are farre out of the way, &amp; not only thincke it, but alſo am therof aſſured. In this and ſuche lyke gentle talke we departed: he ſaing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would pray for me, others willinge me, to deſire him, to ſue for me, whiche I did not. But I wiſhed hym as muche good as he did me. And as he was goinge and bad me fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, he turneth againe &amp; geueth

For, quoth he, (ſwearing an othe) it will not be longe vnto, before thou ſhalte be able to doo more good, then euer
<pb facs="tcp:17085:76"/>
thou dideſte. But I ſhewing my ſelfe not vnthankefull for his good will: departed from hym, as one litle luſting to heare ſuche counſell. Of him I lerned, tweſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye followinge, was the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt daye I ſhoulde tarrye here. Within an houre after this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes departure fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me: the keper mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Clayden called me, ſayinge that he perceaued, howe that my frend Perciual had told him, that maiſter Harpſfeld had written to maiſter doctor Martin: to be a meanes to the Counſell for lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger tyme for me. Where vpon, quoth he, I thincke it were beſte to ſend my Lord of Darbie worde of this to might: leſt he be preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. And I aunſwered thus. That as he thought good, ſo he mighte doo. But, quoth I, beware I hertelye
<pb facs="tcp:17085:77"/>
praye, that you doo not tell my lord any thing, that I deſire this. For if you do, it will in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende be more againſte you then with you. And he promiſed the ſame, and ſo departed oute of hande to the Court. Vpon the .17. day (whiche was ſondaye) in the after nowne, Perciual Creſſe wel ſent me word by him that came firſte with him, that if I woulde make anye ſute my ſelfe, or wil any to doo for me. I might ſpead, but els, quoth he, nothing wil be done, as he p<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſently hath receiued anſwere of my lord Chauncelor. wel, quoth I, I am at a pointe, and ſo toke my leaue, lokinge ſtill when the Sheriffes woulde come for me. For I had heard ouer might, that one of the Garde whiche was appointed to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueye me down, into La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kiſhiere:
<pb facs="tcp:17085:77"/>
had told one that they hade war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt to morowe for me.</p>
            <p>Vppon the .18. daye (whiche was tweſdaye) I hearde that the write for my execucio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was called in again, and the Sheriffe of La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaiſhiere diſcharged of me for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſente. And in the after nowne one of my Lorde of Darbis men brought me worde: howe that my lord had taken greate paines for me, and had kneled before, the Queene, and many more wordes, deſiring me ſom thing to ſe to my ſelfe now. But, quoth he, what, &amp; how muche is done for you I can not tell, but this muche I thincke ſaith he, you ſhal haue your boks, and time ynough to peruſe them. Well, quoth I, I praye you har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telye, thancke my Lorde for hys good wil towardes me, I ſhal (as I haue done pray) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God woulde
<pb facs="tcp:17085:78"/>
giue vnto hym, as to my ſelfe, the which is all I can do. For doinge for my ſelfe, as I woulde be ſorye that my lord or you, ſhuld thincke any waueringe in me for my doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: ſo I would be lothe, but to doo all for my ſelfe, that I can do with a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience. And as for tyme, quoth I, &amp; bokes, although I ſee it is but a lingering of the tyme: yet I am glad of it, in this reſpecte: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my lord, &amp; others may know, I hold no opinion, but ſuch as I dare ſifte, and abide the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning for, with any man. I truſt, you and many others ſhal ſe, that oure doctrine is true, &amp; therefore dare and deſire to abide the light, and all mens lokynge on, where perchaunce it is bruted abrode, that we are altogether obſtinate: and cannot defend it by lernynge,
<pb facs="tcp:17085:78"/>
after this talke, there was a prieſt called maiſter Couppage: which began to exhorte me to take the iniuries done vnto me pacienlye. For, quoth he, I doubte not but if you wil come vnto vs: you ſhuld be more able to helpe manye, and your frendes alſo, then euer you were: bothe ſpirituallye and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porallye. If, quoth I, you kepe your maiſter Chriſte: I wil come vnto you, but other wiſe I knowe you not. This and ſuch like talke we had for that preſente, the Erle of Darbye his man appointynge maiſter Clayden my keper, in the mornyng to come to my Lord.</p>
            <p>Vpon the .19. day, whiche was wedneſdaye, Maiſter Clayden came from my lord, and in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me aſked me, whether I would be contente to ſpake with the kinges
<pb facs="tcp:17085:79"/>
confeſſor, and Alphonſus, a frier, &amp; to ſend him worde. Sir, quoth I, you knowe, that as I deſire co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with no man: ſo I thancke God, I am not afraied to ſpeake with anye man: where vppon he ſent my Lord worde, as he ſaide. And ſo I herd nothing til the day followinge, howe that my Lorde of Darbye, had ſent backe again, two of his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which came to me, ſayinge that they were ſent to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite my cauſe, but howe or what waye I could not lerne.</p>
            <p>Vpon the .21. daye, whiche was friday, the Archebiſhope of yorke, and the Byſhoppe of Chicheſter: came to the Counter to ſpeake with me. When I was come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, they both, &amp; ſpeciallye my Lord of yorke: vſed me verye gentlie, they would haue had me
<pb facs="tcp:17085:79"/>
ſit downe, and bycauſe I woulde not: they alſo woulde not ſitt, ſo we all ſtode, &amp; whether I woulde or no, they would neades I ſhould put on, not onely my night cappe: but my vpper cappe alſo, ſayinge vnto me, that obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was better then ſacrifice. Now thus ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding togither, my Lord of yorke bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to tel me, howe that they were not ſente to me, but of loue and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie we come to you. And I, quoth he, of olde acquaintaunce whiche I haue had woith you, more then my Lord of Chicheſter hath had. And ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended me of a godlye life &amp;c co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluding with a queſtion, how I was certain of ſaluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; of my religion. Marie, quod I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittinge all formalities, ſaue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their good wil, by the word of god, by the ſcriptures,
<pb facs="tcp:17085:80"/>
I am certein of ſaluacion, and of my religion. Verye wel ſaid quod my Lord of yorke. But howe doo you knowe the worde of God and the ſcriptures but by the church? In dede my Lorde, quoth I, the churche was, and is a meane to bring a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more ſpedely, to know the ſcriptures, and the woorde of God, as was the woman of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria was a meane y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritains knew Chriſt, but as when they had herd hym ſpeake, they ſaid now we know, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is Chriſt, not bycauſe of the woordes, but bycauſe we our ſelfes haue heard hym: ſo, quoth I, after we come to the hearing and reading of the ſcriptures ſhowed to vs, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned by the church: we doo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue them, and know them, not by cauſe the church ſaith they are the
<pb facs="tcp:17085:80"/>
ſcriptures, but bicauſe they be ſo, beinge therof aſſured, by the ſame ſpirite whiche wrote and ſpake them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, quoth my lord of yorke, but you know in the Apoſtles ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me at the firſte, the word was not written. True, quoth I, if you meane it for ſome bokes, of the bokes of the newe Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but els, for the olde teſtament, Peter telleth vs that we haue <hi>Firmiorem ſermonem Propheticum,</hi> a more ſure worde of prophecie. Not, quod I, that it is ſimplie ſo, but in reſpecte of the Apoſtles perſons, whiche beinge a liue and compaſſed with infirmitie: attributed to the worde written more firmitie, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with no faulte coulde be founde, whereas, for the infyrmitye of their ꝑſons, men perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce might haue founde ſome faulte at there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ng.
<pb facs="tcp:17085:81"/>
Albeit in verie dede, no leſſe obedience &amp; faith, ought to haue ben giuen to the one, then to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as being all of one ſpirite of truth. That place of Peter, quoth my Lorde of yorke, is not ſo to be vnderſtande of the worde of God written. yes ſir, quoth I, that it is and of none other. yea in dede, quoth my lord of Chicheſter, mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Bradford doth tel you y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth in that pointe. Well, quoth my Lorde of yorke, you knowe that Ireneus and others, do magnify much the churche, and alledge the Churche againſte heretickes, and not the ſcriptures. True, quoth I, for they had to do, with ſuche he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes: as dyd denye the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and yet dyd magnifie the Apoſtles: that they were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to vſe thoſe churches wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

the Apoſtles had taught, and that churche ſtil had receiued the ſame doctrine. you ſpeake the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie truethe, quoth my Lorde of Chicheſter, for the heretickes did refuſe all ſcriptures, excepte it were a peice of Lukes, goſpell. Then quoth I, the alledginge of the churche, can not be primarlye, or principallye vſed againſte me, whiche am ſo farre from deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge of the ſcriptures, that I appele vnto them vtterlye, as to the onelye iudge. Io .xii. A pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye matter, quoth my Lorde of yorke, that you will take vppon you to iudge the Churche. I praye you where was your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

the churche, when I diſcerne it, from that congregacion, &amp; thoſe whiche be not in it. And I neuer denied the church to be Catholike and viſible, althoughe at ſome ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, it is more viſible the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at ſom. I praye you, quoth my Lorde of Chicheſter, tel me where the chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che, which alowed your doctrine: was this .iiii.C. yeres<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will tel you my Lorde, quoth I, or rather you ſhall tell it you ſelfe. If you will tell me where the church was in Helias time, when Helias ſaid that he was lefte alone. That is no aunſwere, quoth my Lorde of Chicheſter. I am more ſorye you ſaye ſo, quoth I: But this will I tell you lordſhipp, that the ſame eies, wherewith a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might haue eſpied the church the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yf you nowe had them: you would not ſaye it

were no anſwere. The fault why the churche is not ſene of you, is, not bycauſe the churche is not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: but bicauſe your eyes are not clere ynoughe to ſe it. you are much deceiued, quoth he, to make ſuch a collation, betwine the chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che then, &amp; now.

But put the caſe I had ben ſo ſtote, as they and your grace make it: was not the lawes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realme on me ſide then? wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vniuſtlie I was puniſhed.

Of truth my lord, quoth I, hitherto I haue ben kepte well ynough withoute bokes, howbeit this I remember of Chriſoſtome, that he lyeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the altar, as the Seraphins do, touch our lips with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coules of the altar in heauen, whiche is an Hiperbolicall locucion, as you knowe Chriſoſtome floweth with them.

the other that the wicked doo not receaue Chriſtes bodie,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lett vs quoth, he loke a litle on the firſte, do you not beleue chriſts preſence raallye and corporallye in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of bread?

I doo beleue that there Chriſt is preſent to the faith of the worthye recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, as there is preſent bread and wyne to the ſences, and outwarde man, as for any ſuche preſence of including and placing Chriſte, I beleue not, nor dare not do. Why, quoth he, I am ſure you beleue Chriſtes natural body is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptible. And here he made mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che a do, of two natures of Chriſt, howe that the one is euery where, &amp; the other is in his proper place, demaunding queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s here about whiche I aunſwered with <hi>etiam,</hi> that is affirmatiuelye, bycauſe
<pb facs="tcp:17085:95"/>
they were ſuche, as no wiſe man would haue ſpente any ſuch tyme about as he did, for I neuer herd of any, that woulde haue denyed them.

This hanges not togither, quod I, becauſe you are here. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go you are at Romme, it is out of Fraunce, bycauſe chriſtes body is in heauen.

<pb facs="tcp:17085:96"/>
you ſhall by demonſtracions out of the ſcriptures declare vnto me, he is obſtinate ſaieth he to his fellow: But, quoth he, to me is not god able to do it. yes ſyr, quoth I But heare the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is of gods will, and not of his powre: Why, quoth he. Doth he not ſay plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye this is my bodye? yes, quod I, and I denye it not, but that it is to the faith of the worthie receuer. To faith, quoth he? howe is that? Forſothe ſyr, quoth I, as I haue no tong to expreſſe it: ſo I know you haue no eares to heare and vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, for faith ſeyth more, then man can vtter, yea, but, quod he, I can tel all that I beleue, you beleue not muche then, quoth I.

<pb facs="tcp:17085:96"/>
deſire to come thyther, for as the mynde is more capable and recea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uable then the mouth, ſo it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth more then the tonge can expreſſe, Chriſte ſayth, it is hys bodie, quoth he. And ſo ſaye I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a certein maner, quoth I: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a certein maner, quoth hee that is after another maner then it is in heauen, ſaint Auguſtin, quoth I telleth it more plainlye, that it is Chriſtes bodye, after the ſame maner circuncyſion was the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunte of God, and the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of faith, is faith, or to make it more plaine, as Baptiſme, and the water of baptiſme is regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Verye wel ſaid, quoth he, Baptiſme and the water therof is a ſacrament of gods grace &amp; ſprit in the water, cloſing the baptiſme.
<pb facs="tcp:17085:97"/>
No ſyr, quoth I, away with your incloſing on the ſame ſorte chriſts bodye is in the bread, on whiche ſorte the grace and ſpirite of God is in the water. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water, quod he: is gods grace by ſignificaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo is the bodye in the breade, quoth I, in the Sacrament, you are muche deceaued, quoth he, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> make no difference beetwene the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes that be ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deres, and the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes that are traun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuntes, and paſſers by. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the ſacramente of Order whiche you denye, thoughe ſaint Auguſtine affirme it, is ſtanderd although the ceremonie be paſte. But in baptiſme ſo ſone as the bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>die is waſhen, the water ceſſeth to be a ſacrament. True good ſyr, quoth I. And ſo it is in the lordes ſupper, no longer then it is in vſe,
<pb facs="tcp:17085:97"/>
is Chriſtes ſacrament. Here was maiſter Alphonſus wounderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye chafed, and ſpeake (as often he had done before) ſo: that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hole houſe dyd ringe againe with an <hi>Echo.</hi> He hath a great name of ler<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning. But ſurely he hath litle pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience. If I had ben any thynge whete: one houſe could not haue kepte vs bothe. At the lenght he cometh to that point, that I could not find in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture, baptiſme, and the Lords ſupper, to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny like ſimilitude togither. And here (lord god) what aray he mad, how that we would receaue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge but ſcripture: &amp; yet we are able to proue nothing by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, Father, ꝙ I, for ſo I called him, God forgiue me if I dyd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſſe, be paciente, and you ſhall ſee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by the ſcripture I will finde

baptiſme and the Lords ſupper, coupled togither. No, quoth he, that canſt thou neuer doo, let me ſee one texte of it, and a great ado he made. At the lenght: ſyr, quoth I, Paule ſayeth, that as we are baptized into one bodie: ſo we are <hi>Potati in Vno ſpiritu,</hi> we haue dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of one ſpirite, meaninge it of the Cuppe in the Lordes ſupper.

Here was nowe lokinge one vpon an other, finallye this ſimple ſhifte was founde: that Paule ſpake not of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Wel, ſir quod
<pb facs="tcp:17085:98"/>
quoth I, thoughe the texte be plaine, yet I wene the fathers do expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it ſo, eſpecially (except my memorie faile me:) Chriſoſtome doth it. Here I ſeing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> blancke: I began to tel them howe I had byn handled in priſon, with oute boke, paper, pen, yucke, and howe vniuſtly I had ben handled, and prayed them, that as they tolde me their comminge was to do me good: ſo they woulde doo it, and not to do me hurte, whiche thyng they much marked not, becauſe of the foyle they had, which I would haue ſuppreſſed. Alphonſus ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whiche had the Teſtamente in his hande, and turned ouer leafe by leafe: at the lenght he commeth to the .5. to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiens: and there red howe that he was giltye, whiche made no

difference of the lordes bodie, yea ſyr, quoth I, but therwith he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he that eateth of of the bread, callinge it bread ſtil, and that, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſecracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as you cal it. And ſo brought furth the ſentence of the .10. to the Corinthe: the breade whiche we breake. &amp;c. Oh, quoth he, how ignoraunt are you which knowe not that thinges retaine the names they had after their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion: as Moyſes Rood. And here they called for a Bible, and ſo was all moſte a quarter of an houre, before he could find out the place, finding faulte at the Bible: bycauſe it was Vataples Bible. At the lenght when he had found it: lord God howe he triumphed but I cooled the heate furthwith for ſyr, quoth I, there is menci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made of the conuerſion, as

well as the ſame appered to the ſence, but, quoth I, here you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fynd it ſo, finde me one worde how the bread is conuerted: and I will then ſaye, you bringe ſome matter, that maketh for you. At theſe wordes he was troubled, &amp; at the lenght, he ſaid, howe that I hanged on mine owne ſence. No, quoth I, that doo I not. For I will bringe you furth (for .viii.C. yeres after Chriſte) the fathers of the church, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme this which I ſpake. No, quoth he, you haue the churche againſte you. I haue not quoth I, chriſt church againſt me. yes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you haue ſayth he. And ſo aſked me what the church was.

And ſo here about we had much ado to none effecte: but to a plaine ſcolding, if I had not giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place to the furor of Alphonſus, for he was verye teſtie and haſtie, and here he diſpreaſed Bucer, and all that praiſed hym, with muche other talke. At the lenght, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor aſked me of the ſeconde que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion what it was. Sir, quoth I, that the wicked men receaue not Chriſtes bodie in the ſacrament, as Sainte Auguſtin ſpeaketh of Iudas, that he receaued <hi>Panem domini</hi> but not <hi>panem dominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> S.

they ſhould get me all the fathers and old aucthors, that proue and affirme the bread to be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſtes bodie.

Thus they went their waies, howe they brooked my talke: I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not tell, for they bad me not fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. After they were gon, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth one of the prieſtes, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me not to be ſo obſtinate. Sir quoth I, be not you ſo wauering. In all the ſcriptures cannot you find me <hi>non eſt panis.</hi> yes thst I can, quoth he, in .5. places.

after wedneſday he woulde come vnto me again, and thus depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted he, after that he had droncken to me in beare and wine, I omitte here, talke of Oxford, of bokes of German writters, of the feare of death, and ſuche other talke whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Vpon the .28. of Marche came to the Counter Doctor Pendel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and with hym Maiſter Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior, ones warden of Maunche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, and Stephen Beiche. After ſalutacions, maiſter Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delton bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſpeake to me, that he was ſorrie for my trouble. And further, quod he, after that I did know you could beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to talk w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> me I made the more ſpede, being as redye to doo you the good, and pleaſure that I can, as you would wiſhe &amp;c. Syr, quod I,
<pb facs="tcp:17085:107"/>
the maner howe I was contente to ſpeake with you was on this ſorte, maiſter Beiche was often in hand with me, whom he ſhould bringe vnto me, and named you amongeſt other. And, quod I, I remember that I ſayd, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeake with you then wyth anye of all other. Nowe the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe I ſo would, I will brieflye tell you, I remember that ones you were (as farre as a man mighte iudge) of the religion that I am of, at this preſente. And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that you haue ſette fourthe the ſame earneſtly. Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye therefore woulde I learne of you, what thynge it was, that moued your conſcience to altre: &amp; gladly would I ſee what thing it is or was y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you haue ſeen ſithe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which you ſawe not before. Here
<pb facs="tcp:17085:108"/>
maiſter Pendelto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſom thing abaſhed, as appeareth by his fo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in his ſpech. Maiſter Brad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forde, quod he, I do not knowe wherfore you are condempned. Marye, quod I, tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion is the thinge, wherof I am condempned, and alſo the denyall of wicked men to receaue Chriſts bodie, wherin I would deſire you to ſhewe me what reaſons, which before you knewe not, dyd moue your conſcience to altre: for ones as I ſayd you were as I am in re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ligion. Heare again maiſter Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delton halfe amaſed, begon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him ſelfe, if it would haue be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as though he had not denyed ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye tranſubſtantiacion in dede, all though the word, quod he I ſaid was not in ſcripture. &amp; ſo he made an endleſſe tale of the thinge that
<pb facs="tcp:17085:108"/>
moued hym to altre. As far as I cold perceaue, it was becauſe he had loked to muche, and giuen to muche diligence and eſtimacion, to Luther and Melancton. But, quod he, I will gether to you the places, and ſend them. And here he deſired me, that he mighte ſee a Copie of that, which I had ſent maiſter Weſton, the whiche I did promiſe hym. This is a ſome of the effectual talke we had. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides whiche talke, we had a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonninge a litle, whether euil men did receaue Chriſtes bodie. I no. &amp; he, yea. I ſaid they receaued not the ſpirite, Ergo not the bodie: for it is no carcaſe, quoth I, hereto I brought out ſaint Auguſtin, how Iudas receaued <hi>Panem domini,</hi> and not <hi>Panem dominum,</hi> how that he muſt be <hi>in corpori Chriſti,</hi> that
<pb facs="tcp:17085:109"/>
muſt receaue <hi>Corpus chriſti,</hi> which he went about to put awaye, with <hi>idem,</hi> and not, ad <hi>idem,</hi> out of ſaint Ierome and howe that <hi>in cotpore Chriſti,</hi> was too bee vnderſtande of al that be in the viſible church, althoughe they be not in the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible churche with God, whiche I denied to be Sainte Auguſtines meanynge, and ſaide alſo: that ſaint Ieromes allegations could not make for that purpoſe. Again we had talke of tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. He bringeth furth Ciprian, <hi>Panis quem dedit Dominus natura mutatus.</hi> And I expounded <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> not for the ſubſtaunce. As quod I, the nature of an herbe is not the ſubſtaunce of it: ſo the breade chaunged in nature, is not to be taken for chaunged in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce, for nowe it is ordeyned
<pb facs="tcp:17085:109"/>
not for the food of the bodie ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye, but rather for the food of the ſoule. And here I broughte fourth Gelaſius, whome he ſaide was a Pope. yea marye, quod I. But his fayth, is my faith, quod I, for the Sacrament, if you wold receaue it. From this talke we wente to talke, wether <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia</hi> were <hi>Res</hi> or no. If they be properlie <hi>Res,</hi> quod I, then be they ſubſtaunce, and if they be ſubſtaunce, (in that we muſte haue <hi>Tetreſtrem rem,</hi> and eayrth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ſubſtaunce in the Sacrament as Ireneus ſaithe): then muſte we not denye bread, quod I. But he ſaide that colour was the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelye thynge, and called it an accidentall ſubſtaunce. And ſo here aboutes wee hadde muche

babling to none effecte. I omitte the talke we had of my Lorde of Caunterbury, of Peter Martirs boke, of his letter laied to my char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge. When he was condempned of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, whether <hi>Dic eccleſie et ce</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was of the vniuerſall churche, or of a particular churche, which at the lenght he graunted of vayne glorye, whiche he willed me to be ware of at his comming furth of the Countre, and ſuche like talke. A litle before his departinge, I ſayde this. Maiſter doctor, quod I, as I ſaide to Maiſter weſton the laſte daye, ſo ſaye I vnto you againe, that I am the ſame man in religion againſte tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiacion ſtill, which I was when I came into priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for, quod I, hitherto I haue ſeen nothynge in anye pointe, to infirme me. At
<pb facs="tcp:17085:111"/>
whiche wordes he was ſom thing moued, &amp; ſaid, that, that was not Catholicke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yes, quod I, and I truſte ſo to proue it, euen by the te<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtimonie of the catholicke fathers, vntill <hi>Concilium Lateranenſe,</hi> and there abouts. The keper maiſter Clayden deſired hym to tarrie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whiche thing he denyed: by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe had els wheare promiſed. And ſo wente his waye: ſayinge, that he woulde came after to me: god one father, be with vs al, and giue vs the ſpirite of his truth for euer. Amen.</p>
            <p>In the after nowne about .5. of the clocke, cometh maiſter weſto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiche ſente worde to the keper, that he would haue ben with me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by .2. of the clocke. Nowe when I was come down out of my priſon chamber vnto him: he very gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
<pb facs="tcp:17085:112"/>
ſaluted me, deſired the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panye: euerie man to departe, and ſo ſat donne, and I beſides hym. And after that he had thancked me for my writtinge vnto hym: he pulled out of his boſome the ſame writing, which I had ſent hym. The copie whereof in Engliſhe (for I did writte it in Laten) ſhal immediatly follow this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicacion. And before he began to read it, he ſhowed me, that he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of my conuerſacion at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge ſithen his being wyth me, &amp;, quod he, maiſter Bradford by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ar a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the glorie of this world, I wil ſpeake it before your face: your life I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue lerned was ſuch there alwaies, as al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, euen y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> greateſt enemies you haue: can not but praiſe you, &amp; it. And therfore I loue you, quod

Such they ar, that a man may well perceaue you ſtande of conſcience, &amp; therfore I am glad, and the more redye to pitie you. So he began to rede the firſt, and there beganne to tell, howe that thoughe the worde tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiacion began but lately: yet the thinge, quod he, was &amp; hath bene ſithen Chriſtes inſtitucion. And I told him, that I did not contend, or hange vppon the worde onlye: but vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the thing which, quod I, is as newe as the worde. Then went he to the ſecond, and there broughte oute ſainte Auguſtine, howe that if an euil man, goinge to the deuyll, did make his will: his ſonne and heyre would not ſaye, hys father dyd lye in it,
<pb facs="tcp:17085:113"/>
or ſpeake tropically. Much more Chriſte, quod he goinge to god, did neuer lye nor vſe any figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſpeach in his laſte wil and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. Do you not remember this place of ſaint Auguſtin, quod he? yes ſyr, quod I. But I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not that ſaint Auguſtine hath thoſe wordes, tropice or fygura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, that is figuratiuelye ſpoken as you reherſe. For a man maye ſpeake a thinge figuratiuely and lye not, as Chriſte did in his laſt ſupper. After this he wente to the third, and broughte furtho <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> howe that the nature of the bread is turned into fleſhe. Here faith he that my Lord of Caunter burie expoundeth nature, for qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie by Gelaſius, the whiche in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretacion ſerueth for the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere of your third argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that

Diſciples goinge to <hi>Emauſe,</hi> to be of the Sacramente, with ſuch other talke to no certein purpoſe, and therfore I prayed him, that in as muche as I had written to hym, the reaſons that ſtabliſhe my faith againſt tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion: ſo he woulde doo the lyke to me, that is, aunſwere myne by writinge, and ſhew me moo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in writinge, to confirme tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:17085:114"/>
ſpeake, litle to the purpoſe for auoidynge of them, and therfore I eftſones prayed him to giue me in writtynge, his aunſweres: he began to tell me, how, &amp; what he had done for Grymbolde, &amp; howe that I neade not to feare anye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche or ſlander I ſhoulde ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine, belike meani<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, to haue me ſecretly, to haue come to them, as Grymbold dyd, for he ſubſcribed. And therefore I ſpeake on this ſorte vnto hym. Maiſter Deane, quod I, I wold gladly that you ſhould not conceaue of me, that I paſſe of ſhame of men, ſimplye, in this matter: I rather would haue you to thincke of me, as the verye truth is: that hitherto, as I haue ſeene, nor heard nothinge to infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me my faith againſte tranſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:17085:115"/>
then I was at my comminge hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I loue, quod I, to be plaine with you, &amp; to tell you at the firſt, that you ſhall finde at the laſt. In good fayth Maiſter Bradforde, quod he, I loue you the better for your plainneſſe: &amp; do not thincke otherwiſe of me, quod he, but that you ſhall find me plaine in al my talke with you. Here he began to aſke me of my impriſonment, and condempnacion. So I began, &amp; told hym, how I had ben ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled, wheare at the ſemed to wounder: yea in playne wordes he ſaide, I had ben handled otherwiſe, then I had gyuen cauſe: &amp; ſo ſhowed me, howe that my Lorde of Bath reported, that I had deſerued a be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nefite at the Queenes hande, and at all the Counſels. In this kind of talke we ſpent an houre almoſt.
<pb facs="tcp:17085:115"/>
and ſo as one wery I did ariſe vp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he called in the keper, and be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore hym bad me be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte, and to bee out of all peril of death. Mary ſir quoth the keper, but it is in euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s mouth: that hee ſhal dye to morowe. Whereat, he ſemed ſome thyng halfe ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſayde, hee woulde goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euenſong, before the Queene and ſpeake to her on my behalfe. And I thynke, the Queene hadde almoſte ſupped at that preſente, for it was paſte ſixe of the clocke. Before the keper I tolde hym a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that ſtyll I was the ſame manne I was at the firſte, and til I ſhould ſee matter to touch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to the contrary: muſt nedes ſo continewe. The keper deſyred me, to hearken to mayſter Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours counſayle, and prayed. M.
<pb facs="tcp:17085:116"/>
Doctor to bee good vnto me. And ſo after we hade dronke together: maiſter Doctor with moſt gentle woordes, tooke his leaue for three dayes. Nowe when he was gone: the keper tolde me, how that may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Doctor ſpake ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, how that he ſawe no cauſe why thei ſhould burne me. Whiche ſentence for the ambiguitie of the meaning, made me ſorye leſte I had behaued my ſelfe in any thinge, wherin he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered anye conformableneſſe to them in their doctrine, which god knoweth I neuer as yet dyd ſo. God oure father bleſſe vs, as hys chyldren, for euer, and keepe vs from all euyll for euer. Amen. V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the fifth daye of Apryll came maiſter Doctor Weſto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

after noone, who excuſed hymſelfe for beyng ſo long abſent: partely by ſickenes, partely for that Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Pendleton tolde hym that hee woulde come vnto me, and parte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that (quoth he) I withſtoode certaine Monckes, which would haue come agayne into Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. After whiche talke, he told me howe that the Pope was dead, and then he tolde me, how he had ſpoken to the Queene for me, and how that death was not nere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. Laſte of all, he excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, for not aunſwering myne ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes againſt tranſubſtanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acion: becauſe my commynge to daye (quoth he) was more by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune then of purpoſe. I woulde gladlye (quoth I) omittyng all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther talkes, haue ſeen an aunſwer to my argumentes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17085:117"/>Why (quoth he) you haue remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered ſome thynge what I ſpake to you, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I was laſt with you. No ſir (quoth I) I neuer called them in maner to mynde, ſythen that tyme, as well becauſe I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped you would haue writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them: as alſo for that they ſemed, not to bee ſo materiall. In good faith (ꝙ he) I cannot ſee any other or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter waye for you, then for to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit youre ſelf to the iudgement of the Churche<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Marye ſo I wyll ſir (quoth I) yf ſo be, by the churche you vnderſtand Chriſtes church. Lo (quoth he) you take vpon you to iudge the church. No ſir (quoth I) that doe I not, in takyng vpon me to diſcerne, I do not iudge the church. yes that you do (quoth he) and make inuiſible. I dooe ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, quoth I. Why, ſayth he, who

can ſee youre churche? Thoſe ſir, quoth I, that haue ſpiritual eyes, wherewith they mighte haue dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, Chriſtes viſible conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion heare vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth. Nay, quoth he, Chriſtes churche hath thre to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, that all men may looke well vpon: namely, vnitie, antiquitye, and conſent. Theſe thre, quoth I, may be as well in euil as in good, as well in ſynne as in vertue, as well in the deuyls churche, as in Gods churche. As for enſaumple, quoth I, Idolatrie amongeſt the Iſraelites had al thoſe thre. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome telleth plainly, as you wel knowe ſaide I, that the church is well knowen, <hi>Tantummodo per ſcripturas</hi> alonely bi the ſcriptures. In good faithe, ꝙ hee, you make your churche inuiſible, when you wyll haue it knowen alonelye by
<pb facs="tcp:17085:118"/>
the ſcriptures. No ſir (quoth I) the ſcriptures dooe playnely ſet furth to vs, the churche, that all menne maye well ynough, thereby know her, yf thei liſt to loke. The church (ꝙ hee) is like a Towre or towne vppon a Hyll, that al men may ſe. True ſir (quoth I) al men that be not blynde. Viſible ynough is the churche, but menues blindnes is great. Impute not therefore to the churche, that whiche is to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to mens blindenes. Where (quoth he) was your church forty yeares agoe? or where is it nowe? excepte in a corner of Germanye. Forſooth ſir (quoth I, the churche of Chriſt is diſperſed, and not tied to this or that place, but to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of god: ſo that where it is, there is Gods churche, yf it bee truelye

Syr (quoth I) yf you wyl, or woulde well marke the ſtate of the church, before Chriſtes commynge, with it now, (as ſaint Paule and Peter wylleth vs) I thynke you woulde not looke for ſuche ſhewes of the churche to be made: as to poynte it oute by realmes. You knowe (quoth I) that in Helyas time both in Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, and els where, Gods churche was not poyntable: and therefore cryed he oute that he was lefte alone. No marye, quoth he, dyd not God ſay that there was .7000 whyche hadde not bowed theyr knees to Baale? Loe, ſayeth he, 7000. ſhewe me ſeuen thouſande a

Syr (quoth I) theſe .7000. were not knowen to men, for then Helias woulde not haue ſayde, that hee hadde bene before left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. And thys is playne ynough, by that whiche the texte hathe, namelye, that God ſayeth <hi>Reliqui,</hi> I haue reſerued to me .7000. Marke that it ſayeth, God had reſerued to hym ſelfe to hys own knowledge, as I doubt not but the hundreth yeares agoe, God hadde hys, 7000. in hys proper places, thoughe menne knewe not thereof. Well maiſter Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forde (ſayeth hee.) I wyll not make youre caſe woorſe, then for tranſubſtanciacion, all thoughe I knowe that we agree not in Other matters.
