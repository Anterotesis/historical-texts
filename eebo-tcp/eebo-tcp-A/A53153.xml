            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>NEWS
FROM
Pannier-Alley.</head>
            <p>I Remember the Reverend Dr. <hi>Henry
More,</hi> in his Epistle to Mr. <hi>Glanvil,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sixt
to his <hi>Saducismus Triumphatus,</hi> p.
13. tells us, That the shrewd wits of
our Age suspect the truth of things for their
Antiquity, and for that very reason
think them the less credible, which (saith
he) is as wisely done as of the Old Woman,
the Story goes of, who being at Church in
the Week before <hi>Easter,</hi> and hearing the
tragical Description of all the circumstances
of our Savious Crucifixion, was in great sorrow
at the reciting thereof, and so solicitous about
the business, that she came to the Priest after
Service with Tears in her Eyes, droping him
a Courtisie, and asked him how long ago this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57081:3"/>
sad Accident happened; to whom he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
about Fifteen or Sixteen hundred Years
ago. She presently began to be comforted,
and said, then in Grace of God it may not be
true. At this pitch of Wit (saith my Author)
in Children and Old Wives is the reason of
our Wit-would-be's of this present Age, who
would catch at any slight occation or pretence
of misbelieving those things that they cannot
indure should be true.</p>
            <p>Reader, the novelty of this following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the unlucky Actions of an invisible
Agent, will effectually Hamstring this pretence
of a misbelief. The which is here presented
to thee attested by the Master, and Maid
of the House, and several other Eye Witnesses
of an untainted credit.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> the Third of <hi>December</hi> 1687.
<hi>Mary Webb</hi> Servant to <hi>Thomas Doo,</hi> a Victua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
living at the Sign of the <hi>Bell</hi> in <hi>Pannier-Alley,</hi>
which is between <hi>Newgate-street</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Noster-Row,</hi>
in the Parish of St. <hi>Foster, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
being sent to fetch home some Pots which
had been carryed to several Houses, she
meets in <hi>Newgate-street</hi> with an Old Woman,
who asked her if she would buy a Wash-Ball,
which would preserve her Hands from Chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57081:3"/>
she replied in a careless manner, what
will you have for one? the Old Woman told
her that the Gentry had given her a Crown a
piece for several, but she should have one
cheaper. The Maid buys a Ball, then the
Woman offers to tell her Fortune, which
she did, and directs her to place a Porringer of
Water in a hole in the Celler, where it might
remain undiscovered for Three Hours, and
then she would find Three broad pieces of
Gold therein, one whereof she expected to
have for her self, which she promised to call
for at the Fourth Hour. Then the Old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
offers to sell her a Paper of Love-Powder
to sow in the hinder part of her Night-Cap,
which should be kept there for Three Nights
and not be discovered to her Bedfellow, and
orders her to go the Fourth day to Market,
where she should see her Sweet-Heart, who
would never leave her until he Married her,
and after this to take the Powder and sow it up
in her Gown, whereby all that should see her
or come near her would be made to admire her.
Then they exchanged Two Six Pences, saying
to each other give me this as I give it you, Three
times; then she said she would go to an Ale-House
and cast a Figure and then call; but not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57081:4"/>
calling according to promise, the Maid goes
to look in her dish finds e'en what the Cat left
in the Malt.</p>
            <p>After this about Eight of the Clock at
Night, the Mistress of the House standing at
the door of one of the Boxes, and upon some
Occation turning her back on the Company
that was there, they espy'd her Gown all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dawbed
with something like Plastering, and
giving her notice of it, she profess'd her Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the manner of its being done. After
this several that came to drink in the House
met with the like scurvy Treatment, but from
whence or whom they knew not.</p>
            <p>One passage is remarkable, <hi>viz.</hi> that Three
Persons sitting by the Fire with their Backs
three several ways, were every one of them
besprinkled with this kind of Whiting or
Plaster-Stuff.</p>
            <p>Another Centleman claps himself in a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that (as he was pleased Jocosely to say)
he might be out of the Devils way, but when
he rose up the Event declar'd him mistaken.
And by the way, if I might be of that Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's
Counsel, I would never advise him
for the future to retreat into a Corner, when a
She-Devil is the Aggressor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57081:4"/>
After this one Morning about Seven a Clock
there was heard a noise like the falling of
Water emptied out of a Pot in the Yard, and
some persons going out to see what it was,
they found a parcel of this Stuff dash'd on the
Stones. And though they have had several
to watch at Night to see if they could discover
whence it should come, hitherto it hath been
in vain.</p>
            <p>Reader, to detain thee with a more tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Relation will now be needless, since so
great numbers of the Neighbourhood are ready
to witness the Truth of this and of a great deal
more.</p>
