            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN respect of the vnmannerly presumption of an indiscrect Printer, who without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant hath divulged the late shewe at Court, presented the 8. of Ianuary, by the Queenes Maiestie and her Ladies, and the same verie disorderly set forth: I thought it not amisse seeing it would otherwise passe abroad, to the preiudice both of the Maske and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, to describe the whole forme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in all points as it was then performed, and as the world well knowes very worthily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by a most magnisice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Queen, whose heroicall spirit, and bountie onely gaue it so faire, an execution as it had. Seeing also that these ornaments and delights of peace are in their season, as fit to entertaine the worlde, and deserue to be made memorable as well
<pb facs="tcp:5463:3"/>
as grauer actions, both of them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curring to the decking &amp; furnishing of glorie, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, as the necessary complements requisit for State and Greatnes.</p>
            <p>And therfore first I will deliuer the intent and scope of the project: Which was onely to present the figure of those blessings, with the wish of their encrease and continuance, which this mightie kingdome now enioyes by the benefit of his most gratious Maiestie, by whom we haue this glory of peace, with the accession of so great state &amp; power. And to expresse the same, there were deuised 12. Goddesses, vnder whose Images former times haue represented the seuerall gifts of heauen, and erected Temples, Altars, &amp; Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures vnto them, as vnto diuine powers, in the shape &amp; name of women. As vnto <hi>Iuno</hi> the Goddesse of Empire &amp; <hi>regnorum praesedi,</hi> they attributed that blessing of power. To <hi>Pallas,</hi> wisedome and defence: to <hi>Venus,</hi> loue &amp; amitie: to <hi>Vesta,</hi> Religion: to <hi>Diana,</hi> the gift of Chastitie: to <hi>Proserpina</hi> riches: to <hi>Macaria,</hi> felicitie: to <hi>Concordia,</hi> the vnion of hearts. <hi>Astraea,</hi> Iustice: <hi>Flora,</hi> the beauties of the earth. <hi>Ceres</hi> plentie. To <hi>Tethis</hi> power by Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5463:3"/>And though these Images haue oftentimes diuers significatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, yet it being not our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to represent them, with all those curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and superfluous obseruations, we tooke them only to serue as Hierogliphicqs for our present intention, according to some one property that fitted our occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing other their misticall interpretations, wherein the Authors themselues are so irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular &amp; confused, as the best Mytheologers, who wil make somewhat to seem any thing, are so vnfaithful to themselues, as they haue left vs no certain way at all, but a tract of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion to take our course at aduenture. And therfore owing no homage to their intricate obseruations, we were left at libertie to take no other knowledge of them, then fitted our present purpose, nor were tyed by any lawes of Heraldry to range the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> otherwise in their precedencies, then they fell out to stand with the nature of the matter in hand. And in these cases it may well seeme <hi>ingenerosum sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere solum ex commentarijs quasi maioru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta industriae nostrae via<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> precluserit, quasi in nobis offaeta sit vis naturae, nihil exseparere,</hi> or that there can be nothing done authenticall, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les we obserue al the strict rules of the booke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5463:4"/>And therefore we tooke their aptest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations that lay best and easiest for vs. And first presented the Hieroglephicq of Empire &amp; dominion, as the ground &amp; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereon this glory of State is built. Then those blessings, and beauties that preserue and adorne it: As armed policie, loue, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Chastitie, wealth, happinesse, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, Iustice, florishing seasons, plentie: and lastly power by sea, as to imbound and circle this greatnes of dominion by land.</p>
            <p>And to this purpose were these Goddesses thus presented in their proper &amp; seuerall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres, bringing in their hands the particular figures of their power which they gaue to the Temple of Peace, erected vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 4. pillars, representing the 4. Vertues that supported a Globe of the earth.</p>
            <p>First <hi>Iuno</hi> in a skie-colour mantle imbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with gold, and figured with Peacocks feathers, wearing a Crowne of golde on her head, presents a Scepter.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Pallas</hi> (which was the person her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie chose to represent) was attyred in a blew mantle, with a siluer imbrodery of al weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and engines of war, with a helmet-dressing on her head, and presents a Launce and Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:5463:4"/>3 <hi>Venus,</hi> in a Mantle of Doue-colour, and siluer, imbrodered with Doues, presented (in stead of her <hi>Cestus,</hi> the girdle of Amitie) a Skarffe of diuers colours.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Vesta,</hi> in a white Mantle imbrodered with gold-flames, with a dressing like a Nun, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented a burning Lampe in one hand, and a Booke in the other.</p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>Diana,</hi> in a greene Mantle imbrodered with siluer halfe Moones, and a croissant of pearle on her head: presents a Bow and a Quiuer.</p>
            <p n="6">6 <hi>Proserpina,</hi> in a blacke Mantle imbrode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with gold-flames, with a crowne of gold on her head: presented a Myne of gold ore.</p>
            <p n="7">7 <hi>Macaria,</hi> the Goddesse of Felicitie, in a Mantle of purple and siluer, imbrodered with the Figures of Plentie and Wisedome, (which concurre to the making of true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse) presents a Cadaceum with the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of abundance.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb facs="tcp:5463:5"/>8 <hi>Concordia,</hi> in a partie coloured Mantle of Crimson and White (the colours of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> ioyned) imbrodered with siluer, hands in hand, with a dressing likewise of partie coloured Roses, a Branch where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in a wreath or knot she presented.</p>
            <p n="9">9 <hi>Astraea,</hi> in a Mantle Crimson, with a sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer imbroderie, Figuring the Sword and Balance (as the Characters of Iustice) which she presented.</p>
            <p n="10">10 <hi>Flora,</hi> in a Mantle of diuers colours, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brodered with all sorts of Flowers, presents a Pot of Flowers.</p>
            <p n="11">11 <hi>Ceres,</hi> in Straw colour &amp; siluer imbrode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with eares of Corne, and a dressing of the same, presents a Sickle.</p>
            <p n="12">12 <hi>Tethes,</hi> In a Mantle of Sea-greene, with a siluer imbrodery of Waues, and a dressing of Reedes, presents a Trident.</p>
            <p>Now for the introducing this Shewe: It was deuised that the <hi>Night</hi> represented in
<pb facs="tcp:5463:5"/>
a blacke vesture set with Starres, should arise from belowe, and come towards the vpper end of the Hall: there to waken her sonne <hi>Somnus,</hi> sleeping in his Caue, as the Proëm to the Visio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Which Figures when they are thus presented in humane bodyes, as all Vertues, Vices, Passions Knowledges, and whatsoeuer Abstracts else in imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are, which we would make visible, we produce them, vsing humane actions, &amp; euen <hi>Sleepe</hi> it selie (which might seeme improperly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise waking motions) hath beene often shewed vs in that manner, with speech and gesture. As for example:
<q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Exccussit tandem sibi se; cubitoque leuatus</l>
                     <l>Quid veniat (cognouit enim) Scitatur.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Intanto soprauenne, &amp; gli occhi chiuse</l>
                     <l>A i Signori, &amp; a i Sergenti il pigro Sonno.</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And in another place:
<q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Il Sonno viene, &amp; Sparso il corpo stanco</l>
                     <l>Colramo intimo nel liquor di Lethe.</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So there, <hi>Sleepe</hi> is brought in, as a body, vsing speech &amp; motion: and it was no more improper in this forme to make him walke,
<pb facs="tcp:5463:6"/>
and stand, or speake, then it is to giue voyce or passion to dead men, Ghosts, Trees, and Stones: and therefore in such matters of Shewes, these like Caracters (in what forme soeuer they be drawne) serue vs but to read the intention of what wee would represent: as in this proiect of ours, <hi>Night</hi> and <hi>Sleepe</hi> were to produce a Vision, an effect proper to their power, &amp; fit to shadow our purpose, for that these apparitions and shewes are but as imaginations, and dreames that portend our affections, and dreames are neuer in all points agreeing right with waking actions: and therefore were they aptest to shadow whatsoeuer error might bee herein presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And therefore was <hi>Sleepe</hi> (as hee is described by <hi>Philostratus in Amphirai ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine</hi>) apparelled in a white thinne Vesture cast ouer a blacke, to signifie both the day and the night, with wings of the same co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, a Garland of Poppy on his head, and in stead of his yuoyrie &amp; transparent horne, he was shewed bearing a black Wand in the left hand, and a white in the other, to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect either confused or significant dreames, according to that inuocation of <hi>Statius.</hi>
               <q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:5463:6"/>
                  <lg>
                     <l>—Nec te totas infundere pennas</l>
                     <l>Luminibus compello meis, hoc turba prccatur-</l>
