         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I want not reasons of the greatest weight to induce me. For first my owne interest of soule goeth therein highly impawned, and engaged in this very point, as hauing (amongst other my motiues) made my owne resolution for matter of Religion, vpon the consideration, and foundation of these most Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick groundes, to wit, of Scriptures, Creeds, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and ancient Fathers) and therefore it impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth me not a litle (touching me so neerely) to looke them ouer againe, since the euer-liuing weale, or neuer-dying wo of my soule dependeth necessarily therupon.

pleadeth for my defence: and this is such, that it inforceth me to encounter all kind of difficultyes in the vndergoing of this busines. For since vpon my second reuiew of the former foure groundes, I found that no other foundation could be layd, no other rule of faith deuised by any, no Angell from heauen teaching the contrary, to be belieued. For, <hi>quod v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num est, verum est; &amp; verum, quod nonvariat,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that most sure and ancient prescription, I thought my selfe in all conscience and duety, both before God and man, obliged to impart the same with your Maiesty, being my naturall borne Prince, King, Father, Lord, and Soueraigne, and I your dutifull &amp; deuoted Subiect.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Finally, if that renowned Moralist <hi>Plutarch</hi> compiled a speciall Treatise to instruct a man how he should reape benefit vnto himselfe, euen by the admonitions, &amp; endeauours of his professed enemies: If that perfect patterne of patience <hi>Iob</hi> (for so the Scripture decyphereth him vnto vs) pleading his innocency out of the integrity of his conscience, and appealing vnto the Tribunall of heauen for an impartiall doome, insinuateth vnto vs by way of demaund, that he listened vnto the counsaile of his seruant or handmaid, contending with him: his words as they lye in the English are expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulatory, <hi>If I haue refused the counsaile of my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant or hand-maid contending with me?</hi> And the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere implied, is negatiue, that he had not, as eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeareth by his summoning himselfe to the barre of diuine iustice: How much rather should we accept the same from our friends, and how much

Wishing and praying with pure handes, and innocent hartes, lifted vp vnto Almighty God, that this may be one, and the selfe same also in tyme; that as there is but one God, one faith, one baptisme, and one Lord IESVS CHRIST, which is aboue all, and in all, and ouer all: so there may be but one vnion, and communion in Catholicke Christian Religion: that is, one Catholicke Mother Church for euery sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wandring, and distressed soule to fly vnto for her spirituall repose, that after our sea-faring peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation we may all arriue safely in the hauen of Heauen.</p>

            <p n="2">2. The very consideration of these two weighty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent circumstances of eternall glory, or endlesse paine wrought such an impression in the hart of his royall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty of England, yea such care, and such feare, and such zeale of clearing himselfe, to speake in the phrase of the Apostle, that in my iudgement, he thought, that the weighty counsaile of <hi>Tertullian</hi> (worthy of eternall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11</note> of euery one that hath a soule to saue) ought to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, and followed of him, to wit: <hi>Cui seueritati declinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae</hi>

            <p n="3">3. Hence proceedeth that worthy industry vsed by his Maiesty in clearing himselfe from that foule crime of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy. And hence came that voluntary confession concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

But yet before I enter into the lists of this argument, I haue esteemed it expedient for sundry causes to premise this other Chapter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the name and attributes, nature and circumstances, properties and differences, prerogatiues and domages, of being a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick or Hereticke: as also to lay downe some way,

how to try the same; to which purpose I haue thought good to addresse certaine seuerall Considerations which do ensue in euery Chapter.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, and a seuere examination of my owne Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in a secret recollected, and most retired conference betwixt God and my owne soule, touching matters of religion, as they shall eyther doome me, or saue me at
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:368:17"/>
the last day. First I considered, yea and seriously within my owne hart debated, demaunding of my selfe, whether the Protestants Church and doctrine (wherof I then was a reall and formall member, and Professor) had not cut it selfe of, yea departed, and separated it selfe from the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and communion of the vniuersall faith, and from the sauing and conuerting Ghospell of Christ his Kingdome, which was first to be preached to all Nations, as Christ <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 24. 14.</note> promised, that it should come to passe before the worldes great destruction, and generall consummation. This was my first demaund, and the answere returned vnto me by the Catholicke Church of ancient Fathers vpon view of <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about his chang in religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> their doctrine, and comparing it &amp;c. nay by the spirit of God, since it was promised to be the guider and directour of his Church; I say, the answere returned, was, that the Protestants Church &amp; doctrine had abandoned both Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick name &amp; Catholick faith, and therefore as beames cut of from the sunne, as boughes violently broken of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tree, and streames and channels parted, and separated from their originall fountaine, as <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> speaketh, they <note place="margin">De vnit. Eccles.</note> were to perish, vanish, and come to naught. And now what course remained for me to take, if I regarded at all the welfare of my soule, but to follow the sage &amp; weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty counsaile of my foresaid authour <hi>Vincentius Lyrinensis</hi> (my Authour indeed being the only meanes next vnder God of my Conuersion from heresy to Catholicke Religion) and that is, to prefer the health and welfare of the whole body before any one pestered and infested member therof. His meaning in plainer termes is, that in time of Schisme and Heresy, or in particuler Countries Apostacy from the Catholicke Christian faith and religion, euery Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Christian that is already in the Church, must hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnder the winges of the Church, by retyring into her lap and bosome, in time of any danger. And he that is an Hereticke, and of an hereticall Congregation, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently forth of the Church, must endeauour by all means
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:368:17"/>
possible to become a Catholicke by returning againe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Communion of Catholick Religion, out of which it is impossible there should be any saluation.</p>
               <p n="21">21. This first Consideration I enlarged yet further, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it by a second supposition, to witt, if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants Church and doctrine be Catholicke indeed (as they would beare the world in hand it is:) then it hath bene generally reaceaued of Christians ouer all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in that sense, as it is now in opposition against the Roman Church: then the Protestants can produce visible Churches of theirs, that haue bene extant from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles time downwards hitherto, that haue held the selfe same points of doctrine, the selfe same number of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; other such differences as now Protestant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches haue in them from the Roman: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to that most sure prescription of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> they can <hi>Edere origines</hi>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by neuer interrupted succession from that time to this of theirs. These things if they shall euer be able sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

and substantially to proue on their part: then shall I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, that they, and their Religion are <hi>Catholicke</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and that out of their Church there is no saluation.</p>
               <p n="22">22.

               <p n="23">23.

And is it any meruaile, that, maugre their heades, they are inforced to this restitution, when they are at such opposition amongst themselues, as is formerly noted? which very opposition it selfe, setting all other arguments of the Catholick a part, doth euidently shew, and demonstratiuely conuince vnto their faces, that they cannot be Catholicks indeed, because

the bondes of this ensuing Consideration, especially for so much as concerning vs so neare, as it doth, this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cannot be but worthy of our weightiest ponderation: and the rather will we the more deliberately consider of this point, for so much as we heare on the one side the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible horrour of the said Name, and on the other side we see the common, and to much vsed familiaryty therof in these our vnhappy tymes, later, and worser dayes, which are so replenished with all kind of Sects and Sectaries, as that each one commonly calleth the other <hi>Hereticke,</hi> and that with as great facility, and with as litle regard, as if the accustomable practice of calling <hi>Hereticke,</hi> had taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the true sense, and reall feeling of an <hi>Hereticke:</hi> or as though he called him good fellow, or witty inuentor of new opinions, which amongst the Sectaries of our age is rather reputed for a pleasant iest, and ingenious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, then for that which in sober sadnes (setting all Atheisticall scoffing and iesting in matters of such mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a part) it is, to wit, a terrible accusation and dreadfull charge of a most high and Capitall crime, committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, his Church, his Sauiour, and all to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of his owne soule.</p>

in respect of the extreame and desperate malice therof: to wit, that it is in a degree of euill and sinne, worse, and more damnable then either Paganisme or Iudaisme, not for that all heresie denyeth more parts of Christian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, then do the Pagans or Iewes (for in this the Pagan <note place="margin">Heresy is worse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iudaisme or Paganis me.</note> sinneth more then a Iew, and a Iew commonly more then an Hereticke:) but because they do corrupt and impugne the Catholicke Christian faith, which once they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and from which they are now wilfully departed, which implieth more malice then can be ascribed to ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iew or Gentile, that neuer receyued the same: In which respect their sinne and damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is more grieuous, say Catholicke Doctors, then is eyther of the other two.

And therefore when an Hereticke in any one article discrediteth, and detracteth from the authority of this Church (which is necessary, and primary condition in beliefe) denying it thereby to be an infallible rule of beliefe in this one article, he deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the same in all the rest. As for example, if a man should aske a Protestant, why he belieueth the Scriptures, and <hi>S. Matthews</hi> Gospell to be <hi>S. Matthews</hi> Gospell? he can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere

no otherwise, but that God hath reuealed the same vnto vs by the Church, which propoundeth these books for Scripture. Here then the proposition of the Church appertaineth to the formall reason or cause of beliefe, as Deuynes doe tearme it, which if once it be denyed or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited in any one article, as the Protestants do, when we alledge it against them for Purgatory, Prayer for the dead, Sacrifice, inuocation of Saints, and the like: then can it not hold in the former about Scriptures, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">An here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke hath no diuine faith at all and why.</note> article, and consequently Hereticks haue no diuyne faith at all about Scripture, or any other article, but are meere Infidels in all; and consequently shalbe damned (say they) not only as chusing Heretickes beleeuing one thing and reiecting the other, but as vnbelieuing Infidells de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid of all faith. Which seemed to me to be a very terrible commination and fearfull distriction: and yet did I see it substantially grounded, and so orderly deduced, as that I must ingenuously confesse, it so conuinced my vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and informed my iudgment, that I could not do otherwise then giue my full consent vnto it. Nor did I possibly see how the same might be any way denyed, or probably with any colour of reason impugned.

               <p n="41">41. And the same <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in the very same place before cited, registreth this story of <hi>S.

               <p n="42">42. And truly this one point ministred vnto me store of matter, and exceedingly enlarged my meditation, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider on the one part, how carefull, and not only carefull, but fearefull these ancient Fathers, and Apostles were (as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> testifieth) to admit any conuersation, or to enter into communication with Hereticks, flying them as mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But this proceeds from a supine negligence and carelesse inconsideration; for such as seriously ponder, and earnestly debate the matter more deeply, doe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend farre otherwise therof, especially such as are addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the reading of ancient Fathers, the surest refuge,

and pillars for a resolued soule to rely vpon for true dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in religion, in these miserable dayes of Schisme, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy, and Apostasy: <hi>Nulla</hi> (saith the old holy martyr <hi>S.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:368:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Heresie he was so inflamed with the zeale of God his true Religion, so rigorous and seuere against the enemies of God his truth, that he burst forth into this vehement exclamation against them: <hi>Viperea Haereticorum vitate collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quia, nihil nobis commune sit cum eis, qui Catholicae aduersantes fidei solo</hi>

               <p n="45">45. Vpon these groundes then, reasons, causes, and contemplations the whole streame, and ranke of Ancient Fathers do with full consent concurre in this one point, &amp; do inculcate the same often in their writings, to wit, that it is impossible for an Heretick excluded from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church to be saued, or to auoid euerlasting dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and perdition of body and soule, though he should <note place="margin">That He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks by no good works can be saued.</note> liue morally neuer so well, giue neuer so great almes, do neuer so many good workes, suffer neuer so much by the losse of his goods, countrey, liberty, or life it selfe. Which point is oftentimes inculcated, reiterated, and repeated by that renowned Martyr <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> in that worthie Tract of his <hi>de Vnitate Ecclesiae:</hi> as, <hi>Nunquam perueniet ad praemiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christi qui scindit, aut diuidit Ecclesiam Christi:</hi> he shall neuer partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of heauenly felicity, that makes a rent, and breach in

the Church of Christ, by the cryme of heresy. Againe the same Authour, in another place, to argue his assured con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of this poynt, addeth, and denounceth further: <hi>Macula ista nec sanguine abluitur,</hi> this blot of heresy, or separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">De vnitate Ecclesiae.</note> himselfe from the Church of Christ, cannot be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed away with bloud; <hi>inexpiabilis culpa, nec passione purgatur:</hi> It is a fault so inexpiable, that it cannot be purged by death it selfe. Nay he goeth yet further and saith: <hi>Non erit fidei corona, sed perfidiae poena:</hi> Such sufferings or death it selfe <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> shall not be vnto them any crown or reward of their faith and right beleeuing, but a punishment of their perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and false dealing.</p>
               <p n="46">46. Conforme to <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> is <hi>S. Chrisostome,</hi> who in his 11.

               <p n="47">47. And now that I may come to the vpshot of all which is the sume and substance of what hath hitherto beene spoken in this Consideration; my principall conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion thereof is this, to wit, that the greatest misery and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity that may possibly be imagined in this life, to light vpon any, and the greatest dereliction, I meane departure of Gods sauing grace or punishment, that Almighty God for his sinnes can possibly lay vpon a Christian man, is to leaue him so far vnto himselfe, and to his owne choice and election, as to suffer him to become an Hereticke, or to admit any participation or communication with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes. And surely if God euer punished sinne with sinn, as you shall read he did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 24. which is that fearfull

Why should a man be damned by his owne iudgment, be left inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable, for that no plea of pretended ignorance will serue his turne, since being such a chooser, or hereticall man, as <hi>S.

For if the meanes, and way of conuiction, &amp; decision be not infallible, it should seeme that man may make his choice: but this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler choice, and election, out of a mans owne head, and priuate iudgment (which makes a choosier or Hereticall man) is seuerely prohibited, and condemned; and that by the iudgment of <hi>S.

For so he promised, when <hi>Isay</hi> prophesied thus, saying: <note place="margin">

                  <hi>That at the comming of Christ, there shalbe a holy path, and a way, and it shall be vnto you a direct way, so as fooles may not erre therin.</hi> Thus he prophesied. And is there any doubt, that he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it? Hath he promised, and shall not he make it good? Hath he spoke it, &amp; shall he alter the thing that is gone out of his lippes? Atheisme, Heresy, and Infidelity may <note place="margin">

               <p n="51">51. Wherfore this ground being presupposed and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a chiefe principle in Christian Religion, that there <note place="margin">How this generall rule may be found out</note> is some such way left vnto vs, whither we must haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course in all doubtfull causes and controuersies of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the Question then is betwixt the Protestants and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:368:29"/>
those of the Catholicke Roman Religion, where, and what this way is, how we may come to the notice of it, and in what manner it is to be followed, after it is once found out. The Protestant commonly of what Sect or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction soeuer he be, auerreth, that the written word of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Scripture is this infallible way &amp; directory-guid: and this he doth not, in my conscience, so much for any honour and reuerence that he beareth vnto the oracles of Gods sacred Writ (as he would falsely beare the world in hand he doth:) but only vpon an hereticall intent, that he may auoid therby the iudgement of the Church. And no meruaile, for, <hi>Qui malè agit, odit lucem,</hi> the guilt of his <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioan.</hi> 3. 20.</note> Heresy flyeth the censure of the Church. Some others do add, that when the Canon of Scripture is not perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and obuious vnto euery man, then for explication of the word they may inquire of the spirit of God, which inspireth ech man, and that will instruct him, and lead him vnto all truth. But now this falsely supposed and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary spirit, can be no infallible rule of direction. For <note place="margin">The way of euery mans pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate spirit</note> that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> hath giuen vs a Caueat touching these false spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. <hi>Beloued, belieue not euery spirit, but try the spirits, whether they be of God, for many false Prophets are gone sorth into the world.</hi> And was not this the common tricke of all condemned Heretickes and heresies? Did they not all of them plead the spirit of God, against the liuely authority and spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king voice of the Church? Doth not the whole ranke of ancient Fathers that wrote against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thunder out that terrible comminatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, threatning a fearefull woe and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance vnto all priuate, lying, and deceyuing spirits: <hi>Vae illis qui sequuntur spiritum suum:</hi> Woe be vnto them that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their owne spirit? Lastly haue not all ancient Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies and Heretickes, <hi>Arians, Nestorians, Pelagians &amp;c.</hi> beene vniustly condemned, and therefore must not their heresies be raked out of the ashes of Hell againe, and set fresh foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Church, if the rule of interpreting Scripture be ech man his priuate spirit? It cannot be denyed, for
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:368:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that all of them vaunted of the spirit, as the Sectaries do at this day. Well then the conclusion is, that this vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the spirit, is nothing else, but a horrible belying, and presumptuous blaspheming of the spirit of God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that spirit of vnited verity, a spirit of distracted he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy: And therfore this their priuate spirit can be no rule to direct them any longer. And so much of this way, in following euery man his owne spirit.</p>
               <p n="52">52. And now for the former way of following Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Scriptures, for this only rule and sure direction, though this be euer to be graunted, as most true, that the holy Scriptures breathed by the instinct of the spirit be diuine, and of infallible truth and direction, when they are by the Church both known to be Scriptures, &amp; right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interpreted by the assistance of the spirit in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches voice &amp; sense: yet forasmuch as the Scriptures subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity fitteth not with euery meane, and ordinary capacity (for the most part of people are vnlearned, and cannot read, or vnderstand what they read, much lesse those learned tongues wherein the Scriptures were originally written:) It followeth euidently that the Scriptures alone, can be no sure, vniuersall, &amp; infallible way for the discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Catholicke Religion, and discouering of heresie. Or at least wise this rule is not generall to all, as it ought to be: for as much, as all must haue sufficient meanes left for their saluation.</p>
               <p n="53">53. But here me thinketh I heare the Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t obiect, that howsoeuer the Scripture is no way for the ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned: yet is it the only rule, and Canon of faith vnto <note place="margin">Whether only scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible way.</note> the skilfull and learned: and that whereas the Canon of the Scripture is perfect, and is of it selfe alone sufficient i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for all points, what needeth the authority of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall interpretation to be added vnto this Canon? To this I answere, and first this waie we now speake of, must be a way for all, <hi>semita, via, &amp; via sancta:</hi> a path, a way, &amp; holy way; yea such a way if we belieue Almighty God,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:368:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
speaking by the mouth of <hi>Isay: Stulti non errent per eam,</hi> the most ignorant and vnlearned cannot mistake it. For that Christ the way of all hath left this way vnto all, &amp; that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Isa.</hi> 35. 8.</note> his Incarnation &amp; Passion, for to that time the prophet <hi>Isay</hi> alludeth: &amp; therfore the Scripture excluding the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for want of tongues and other learning, &amp; the greatest part of it being writen before the said Christs Incarnation and passion, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be this way. Secondly I answer, that as the Scripture alone ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be the way vnto the vnlearned, no more can it be the rule vnto the learned, for that not only fooles, but such as thought themselues both learned and wise, haue erred by that waie of Scripture alone, and their priuate spirit to help them: and hereof we haue as many liuely testimonies and examples, as there haue byn learned hereticks in the Church, who thinking the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues wise and learned, and yet pretending Scriptures, haue run awry, so dangerous a way is this way of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, without the guide of the Church to walke in. Thirdly and lastly, touching the sufficiency of holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non without any addition of Ecclesiastical Interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I answere, this obiection (which is the maine position and foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for all the Protestants Heresies at this day) is as ancient as twelue hundred years ago, and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by <hi>Vincentius Lyrinensis</hi> in the person of the Hereticks of his time, and answered thus: <q>To sacred Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (saith he) <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cont. haer cap.</hi> 2.</note> the Ecclesiasticall Interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must be added, because in regard of the Scriptures sublimity all men expound it not in one &amp; the selfe same sense, but this man &amp; that man do diuersly interpret the selfe same places of Scripture, that in a manner how many men there be, so many senses may be wrested from it. For <hi>Nouatian</hi> expounds Scripture one way, <hi>Photinus, Sabellius, Donatus, Arius</hi> another way &amp;c. And therfore in regard of the manifold turnings and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of seuerall errour and heresy, it is very needfull, that the line of Propheticall and Apostolicall Interpretation be directed, according to the rule of Ecclesiastical and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke

some small question in Religion: yet ought not we to haue recourse vnto the most ancient Churches, wherin the Apostles had once bene conuersant and so take from them that which is certaine and cleere for deciding of the question?

               <p n="62">62. Thus farre <hi>S.

And the reason there rendred by the same Father, is this: She is the store-house wherein Christs merits, and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches treasure is laid vp: <q>She is the way of life, whereby we may come to eternall life, and escape euerlasting death: that all are theeues, yea murtherers of soules, that doe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne her, or seeke other wayes of tryall then her, and her tradition from hand to hand: That this tradition is sufficient, though there were no Scripture: That from her, and her alone, the truth is to be taken, and not els <note place="margin">To what triall the ancient Fathers prouoked the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes of their tyme.</note> where: That by her, and her authority alone, all doubts and questions are to be so ued, and decided.</q>  Can any thing be spoken more effectuall then this? Or is there any more playne, easy, euident, and vniuersall direction? Can any rule be more probable and infallible, then the rule of the Church? And to this do agree both my foresaid Authour in many other places of his workes, as also all that succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, &amp; tooke the like enterprize in hand of writing, and prescribing against Hereticks, as <hi>Tertullian, S.

prophane innouations of the Hereticks of his time, and diuers others, which to auoyd prolixity I omit: all these do principally, and really prouoke, and challenge all the Heretickes of their tyme vnto this only and sure waie of the Catholicke Church in their dayes, for the triall of the truth, and for discerning what is truly Catholicke and what is Hereticall: their seuerall sentences are to prolixe to be conteyned within the strict precinctes and narrow boundes of my briefe intended Confiderations,</p>
               <p n="63">63. And now to put a period to this my third Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, least it exceed a due proportion, the vpshot is this. For asmuch then as this visible Christian Church, begun and founded by our Sauiour vnder the Apostles, was a visible Church, made, and consisting of visible men, gouerned by visible Pastors, hath visibly descended from age to age through the centuries of the Church by all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ordinary succession of Bishops (which <hi>Tertullian</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Videsupr,</note> required of the Hereticks of his time, as they would auoid the blot of heresy) that haue lineally come downe to our dayes. Secondly, for asmuch as the authority of his Church was esteemed in euery age, to be the same (for infallible direction) that it was in the former first ages, through the assurance of Christ his promise to that effect. And lastly for as much, as the whole vniuersall Church of the fiftee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th age hath in a generall Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell examined, decyded, conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned the doctrine of the Protestants for heresy in more then an hundred maine points by name, &amp; hath accursed, and ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematized <note place="margin">The issue of this Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> both them, and all their participants to the pit of hell, &amp; that according to the very selfe same grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, wherby the ancient Fathers did vse to curse, &amp; anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize all ould heresies, and Hereticks in former tymes: these things, when I considered with more attention &amp; made a generall reflection thereon, a suddaine feare and care, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished, yea as it were, ouerwhelmed me, for that my euerlasting saluation depending vpon this point, I had beene so negligent in examining the premises. And now I
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:368:36"/>
plainely saw, as in a perfect glasse of most impartiall iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that vnlesse I could imagin with my selfe (as diuers others fanatically do) that Christes promise had fayled, &amp; that the first visible Christian and Catholicke Church founded by him, and spread ouer the whole world had fayled, vanished, and perished, as being ouercome by hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, and ouer growne with the weedes of errour &amp; he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy; I could neuer haue any hope of saluation, as long as I continued in the Protestant Religion. And this was the issue of that Consideration.</p>

Thus then you apparently see, that for making of an errour or heresie damnable it is not required of absolute necessity, that it deny some thing of the blessed Trinity directly, or some maine article of the Creed &amp;c. as many of the first ould heresies did, when the doctrine therof was not so well explaned, as now it is, though this be a des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate shift of the Protestant, and most miserable euasion, and yet it will not serue his turne, he being guilty of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy in all those high pointes, yea &amp; of misbeliefe almost in euery article of the Creed: for that, as before hath beene touched in the third Consideration, the greatnes of the sinne of heresy dependeth more of malice, and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <note place="margin">What sort of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy is more da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And the reason therof is, for that this second erreth with more obstinacy, and malice (which corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth the very essence of heresy) then the first, though both of these men being out of the Church, must be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but yet with different measure of punishment.</p>
               <p n="73">73. This fearefull Conclusion then of damnation stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a foote and remaining in full force to be inflicted vpon all kind of Hereticks: we are now, and next to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, whether the Protestants opinions at this day wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they differ from the Catholicks, be truely heresy, being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared with the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith and Religion: and secondly we are to discusse, whether the different sortes, sects, and professions of the said Protestant religion, among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:368:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
especially the principall, as <hi>Lutherans</hi> &amp; <hi>Sacramentaries</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> be heresies to the other: and the like of Puritans and Protestants in England, all originally rising from <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Luther:</hi> I say we are to consider, whether all these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall heades, be Hereticks indeed, the one to the other, or may be saued togeather, ech man dying in his owne Religion.</p>
               <p n="74">74. To proceed then in order vnto the examination of the particulers. And first that Protestant Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great points throughout the mayne corps of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies now in hand, is truly heresy to those of the Roman <note place="margin">That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions are truly heresies.</note> fayth and Catholick Religion: this point being so cleare needeth no further dispute, for asmuch as the Protestants do openly auouch aboue an hundred positions, against the same Roman Catholick Church, defending the same with obstinate resolution. And the late generall Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> (where the flower, piety, and learning of the whole Catholicke Christian world vnder one spreame Pastour, and infallible conduct of God his holy Spirit were assembled) hath discussed, examined according to ancient grounds of holy Fathers, discouered for Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and thereupon hath anathematized 125. points by name, and that in so many different Canons enacted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Sacraments</hi> only, and the controuersy of <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:</hi> Besides all the rest, I say, the case being thus cleare against them, and their conuiction so manifest, there needes no further dispute. For if by <hi>S. Augustine</hi> his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, euen now alleadged, and other Fathers of greatest learning and credit in the Church, one only erroneous proposition, or assertion held with obstinacy against the doctrine of the knowne Christian Church, be conuinced for a point of heresy, and held for a matter of most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine damnation to the houlder, for that it casteth a man out of the said Church (out of which is no saluation) what is to be inferred where so many conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned assertions are held against the knowne Church, &amp; authority therof?</p>

75. To the second also, to wit, whether <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Sacramentaries</hi> (who made the first diuision of Protestants, whilst <hi>Luther</hi> himselfe was yet aliue) be truly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hereticks, the one to the other, and consequently that the saluation of one is the damnation of the other, were it possible that any Sectary could be saued: This is with as great facility proued as the former, and that first by the testimony of <hi>Martin Luther</hi> himselfe, the originall Authour of all these later Sectes: and then by the mutuall, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring consent of all the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctors, Pastours, and Prelates that succeeded him.</p>
               <p n="76">76. First I say, it is well knowne that <hi>Luther</hi> himselfe euer reputed the Sacramentaries (that comprehend both <hi>Zuinglians</hi> and <hi>Caluinists)</hi> for da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mnable, and intollerable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks. Let his owne testification often reiterated, and seriously aggrauated in diuers of his bookes be a sufficient co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation of this. His first serious Censure denounced against them all, is this: <hi>Haereticos seriò censemus, &amp; alienos ab Ecclesia Dei Zuinglianos, Sacramentarios omnes, qui negant Christi</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luther. in art. ad Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaniens.</note>

Can any thing be spoken more clearely, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined more effectually then this? Or can any Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist with any face hereafter exempt himselfe from out of the number of them that are accursed, and condemned by their owne grand Progenitour?</p>
               <p n="77">77. The same in effect he hath in his Epistle <hi>ad Iacobum Presbyterum Ecclesiae Bremensis:</hi> his wordes are these: <hi>All Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries that deny the Reall Presence are Hereticks, and for such to be auoided.</hi> And yet in a third place (least any man should thinke he had altered his iudgement) <hi>de Coena Domini,</hi> of the supper of the Lord, he condemned by name for dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Hereticks, the very first Authors of Sacramentary
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:368:40"/>
doctrine, to wit, <hi>Carolostadius, Oecolampadius,</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> (and questionles <hi>Caluin</hi> had neuer escaped his singers, as sly an Hereticke as he was, had he bene then either of name, or note:) well his finall and irreuokable doome (for it was denounced against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his decrepit age) was this: <hi>Ego tamquam alterum pedem iam habens in sepulchro &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q>I being now ould, and hauing as it were one foote in my graue, do yet carry this testimony &amp; glory with me to the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of Iesus Christ, that with all my hart I haue condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as enemies of the Sacrament, <hi>Carolostadius, Zuinglius,</hi> and <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> and all their disciples and followers, and haue auoided their company, &amp; haue no familiarity with them, eyther by letters, writings, wordes, or deedes, as the Lord hath commanded not to haue with Heretickes.</q>Thus much of <hi>Luther</hi> himselfe.</p>
               <p n="78">78.

               <p n="79">79. <hi>Franciscus Stancarus</hi> also, no meane Authour, one of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> side, writing to the King of <hi>Polonia</hi> in his days, pronounceth confidently of all those new professors vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Caluin</hi> in <hi>Geneua,</hi> that they were <hi>Publici &amp; manifesti haeretici,</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:368:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
notorious and manifest Hereticks. And yet as though this were little, the same Author in his booke <hi>de Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,</hi> prescribeth this Caueat to the Christian Reader, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Caluin</hi> (and would to God it were as well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and practised in the Vniuersities of <hi>England,</hi> where yong Deuines are for the most part poysoned with the drugges and dregges of <hi>Caluins</hi> doctrine (my hart bleedeth to thinke of it) before they can tast of the pure liquor of <note place="margin">Beware of Iohn Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin.</note> antiquity:) well the admonition is this: <hi>Caue Christiane Lector &amp;c.</hi>

VVhereby is vnderstood, not only the censure of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Church, concerning the Caluinists <note place="margin">The Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinists co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

VVhich articles are reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by other Lutheran writers, as namely by <hi>Albertus Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerus</hi> in his booke, intituled, <hi>The warre of Iohn Caluin with Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</hi> which booke was set forth in the yeare of our <note place="margin">The war of Iohn Caluin with Iesus Christ.</note> Redemption 1598. wherin he sheweth, that the Articles wherby the <hi>Lutherans</hi> do cheifly differ from the <hi>Caluinists</hi> hereticall doctrine, are of the person of Christ, of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of our Lord, of Baptisme, and of Predestination. And <hi>Iacobus Halbruneir</hi> another Lutheran Doctor, published an other booke the same yeare before, to proue Caluinisme to be heresy: and to the former articles of <hi>Albertus,</hi> he addeth other two, wherin Lutherans and Caluinists do deepely dissent, which are, <hi>de Maiestate Christi, &amp; Ministerio Verbi;</hi> wherby he maketh it euident, that <hi>Caluinists</hi> are truly and properly Hereticks to <hi>Lutherans.</hi> And this for the second point.</p>

Which being presumed by them (as they must needes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume) to be the only true Catholike Church: it must needes follow, that Puritans, who from their innermost soules detest the same and the communion thereof, as Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, must needes be Sectaries, nay Heretickes to that Church. And this is consonant to the doctrine of these Scriptures, and most conformable to the opinion of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers, as is before copiously in the precedent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations asseuered.</p>

For confirmation of which dissention capitall, and reall hostility, betweene our Puritans and Protestants in sundry mayne points of their Religion, I might heere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and produce infinite authorityes, and innumerable arguments, if I should not surcharge my Treatise. The two bookes yet extant printed by publicke authority, in one and the selfe same yeare, I meane the <hi>Suruey of the holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Discipline,</hi> compiled, as it is thought, by him that is now arriued to the highest pitch of Ecclesiasticall dignity in that Kingdome: and the other, bearing the inscription of <hi>daungerous Positions,</hi> ascribed to Doctour <hi>Sutcliffe,</hi> both of them receyuing presse at <hi>London</hi> by <hi>Iohn VVolfe, Anno Dom.</hi> 1593. do sufficiently notifie vnto the world, how recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliable the Puritan position is with the Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that in sundry Articles of great weight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And amongst many others (which to auoid pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity I purposly omit) the titles of the 22. and 23. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:368:41"/>
of the <hi>Suruey</hi> are these: <hi>That they</hi> (to wit the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans) <hi>do take from Christian Princes, &amp; ascribe vnto their pretended regiment, the supreme and immediate authority vnder Christ in causes Ecclesiasticall, and in the oppugning theros do ioyne with the Papists.</hi> Whereupon I inferre, that if this spirituall Supremacy be any substantiall point of doctrine amongst the Protestants, then the obstinate repugnance therof by the Puritans must needes be Schisme and Heresy.</p>
               <p n="82">82. I pretermit diuers other bookes whereof I haue beene an eye witnesse, how purposely, and directly they treat of these matters, as namely the Answere of the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chancelor &amp; Doctors of <hi>Oxford</hi> vnto the petition of a 1000. Puritans, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1603. wherein it is plainely conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that the Puritans hould their platforme of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answere pag.</hi> 20.</note> gouerment, of the gouerment of Christ vpon earth, for a thing of no lesse importance, then is the Ghospell of Jesus Christ. They hold it further for an essentiall part of their said Ghospell, for a matter of faith, to be receyued vpon paine of damnation, for an essentiall marke of the true Church, without the which the Protestants Church is no Church, their faith no faith, their Ghospell noe Ghospell &amp;c. And to conforme to that which <hi>M. Rogers</hi> writeth in his Preface to the Bishops Articles, where he testifieth that the <hi>Puritans</hi> do hold their platforme, differing from the Protestants, to be a speciall part of the Ghospell, yea the very Ghospell it selfe, &amp; to be of such importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, <hi>as if euery haire of their heades were a life, they ought to affoard them all in defence therof.</hi> So they. And in sober sadnes, supposing their principles to be true, haue they not great reason, for that their differences be in so maine &amp; very substantiall points, if we refere them to their heades, wherof there is extant a very substantiall declaration and conuiction (as to me it seemeth) in the Preface of the Catholicke Deuine in his answere to <hi>Syr Edward Cookes fifth part of Reportes,</hi> whither I referre the ingenous, &amp; iudicious Reader for further per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usall of this point: for there it is shewed, and irrefragably,

against all impugners therof, proued, how essentiall and substantiall difference of doctrine there is about the origen <note place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical power in the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan and Catholick Church.</note> of Ecclesiasticall power, and authority betweene the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes, Puritans, and Catholickes of England; the one, that is the Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ascribing it to their temporall Prince; the other challenging it, as most properly pertayning to their priuate Conuenticles &amp; Assemblies: the last &amp; third to the Succession of Bishops from the Apostles, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence wherof is this, that whosoeuer of the three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties haue the right in this point, there only is the true Church, there alone is the true Ecclesiastiall Authority of preaching, teaching, or dayning Ministers, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string Sacraments, exercising Censures, and Iurisdiction, binding or loosing, remitting or retaining sinnes, and the like &amp;c. And for the other two Churches, they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne as secular and prophane Congregations, without any vitall spirit of Ecclesiasticall power at all. Let them then contend neuer so much about the keys of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Iurisdiction: yet the plaine truth is, they shall neuer be able to open or shut the gates of heauen, vnto their owne friendes, or against their enemies.</p>

And to conclude, euery where almost throughout the same Constitutions, they are sharpely censured for Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries and Schismaticks: which censure proceeding from the Protestant Church with so full a stroke of authority must of necessity in their owne iudgement depriue the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of all meanes of saluation in that Church, they stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out with pertinacy against the same, as they doe: &amp; consequently this doome must needes fall vpon one of their heades, that the Protestants, and they can in no case be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued togeather.</p>

            <p n="2">2. But yet I must ingenuously confesse, that imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my selfe somewhat seriously in my priuate meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and most secret silence, about this subiect, many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties occurred, &amp; diuers were the Considerations that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented themselues vnto me, as my mind began to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what earnesty bent about this busines: and these I haue thought good to impart vnto the Christian Reader in this place, as they ensue.</p>
            <div n="1" type="consideration">
               <head>The first Consideration.</head>
               <p>AND first, if this were all, &amp; that on Scriptures behalfe there were no more to be required to proue, &amp; make a man a Christian Catholicke, but a franke and ingenious <note place="margin">The belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Scriptures not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make a man a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke.</note> acknowledgement to assent vnto, and to belieue all those Scriptures which we deeme for Canonicall in our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for the sense to iudge it agreeable and correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to our own priuate imaginations: I say, if this were all, all controuersies of Religion betwixt all parties neuer so opposite &amp; different in opinion might easily (no doubt) surcease, and speedily without either further delay or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, be accorded, for that all sides and parties do freely
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:368:47"/>
and voluntarily offer to professe this point, and that as I verily thinke from their hartes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But (alas) this is neyther all, nor any sound part of all: all is but <hi>we deeme,</hi> and we <hi>iudge</hi> this is Scripture, and this is the sense: here is nothing in all, but that which marreth all, &amp; that in the very maine point which should make all, and that is proper choice, priuate election, which we know by that which hath bene formerly treated, and sufficiently proued, must needes be heresy, and conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this mayne ground of Scripture it selfe thus from our selues taken, and thus laid for auoiding of heresy, openeth the very mayne gap vnto all heresy. And yet I must here (though now with no small griefe, and vexation of spirit, I do remember it,) liberally acknowledge, that for some yeares togeather (when I framed Religion in the shop of my owne brayne, proper inuention, and priuate glosses, as <note place="margin">An exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Authors case him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</note> all Sectaries vsually do) I was so hartily affected, sincerely (as I thought) delighted, yea as it were rauished with this alluring consideration, and best pleasing perswasion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures alone, whose sole authority I seemed to my selfe then to follow, and no other humane or terrene motiue whatsoeuer, no not so much as once reflecting backe vpon the authority of the Church (whence as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued the Scriptures themselues, so much more ought I to haue receaued the sense) as I thought my selfe more then halfe in heauen, when God knoweth I was ready to tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into the pit of hell, thinking this way of the Scriptures alone of all other waies, the most infallible, and so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, as that I could not possibly erre therby.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And being in this peremptory presuming veine, and straine of Scriptures, to adde as it were fuell vnto the fire of this my strong conceipted imagination, I often tymes remembred, and with wonderfull admiration repeated, yea reiterated againe and againe that animous, couragious heroicall sentence and speach of Apostolicall, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall fortitude (as to me it then seemed) of <hi>Luther</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:368:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who alleadging Scriptures for his cause, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all other proofes, thus triumphantly insulted ouer King <hi>Henuy</hi> the eight: <hi>Hic sto, hic sedeo, hic glorior, hic trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho,</hi>

                  <hi>hic insulto &amp;c.</hi> Here I stand, here I sit, here I do glory, here I do triumph, here I do insult ouer Papists, Thomists, Henricistes, and Sophistes, and all the gates of hell, much more ouer the sayings of men, be they neuer so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <note place="margin">The stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g presu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous speach of Luther.</note> God his word is aboue all: the diuine Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> maketh for me: so as I passe not if a thousand <hi>Augustines,</hi> a thousand <hi>Cyprians,</hi> and a thousand King <hi>Henries</hi> Churches should stand against me.

               <p n="6">6. And truely this bould kind of free speach affected me very much as then, for that it seemed to me simply to proceed out of the exceeding great confidence of his cause, and me thought that I felt and perceiued some part, and measure of the same spirit in my selfe at that time, which brought me also to this peremptory resolution, to wit, that whatsoeuer I spake forth of Scriptures, or could make but the least shew of wordes and warrant for out of Gods holy booke, that must nedes be true, certaine and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in the very selfe same sense that I speake it, and could not possibly, no not by men, or Angells be controlled. The same spirit also did I obserue in many others of my brethren of the English Ministry, who in like manner, &amp; some of them with great zeale, grounded themselues vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Scriptures, euen as I did; which concurrence in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did not a little co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme me in this my owne headstrong imagination.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But afterwardes vpon better insight of matters ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occurrences, and circumstances of no small importance for the shaking and ruinating of this false and tottering foundation, interposed themselues to the view of my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding: and these greatly calmed this feruour of mine and abated the edge of my appetite vnto the bare letter of the Scripture, and my owne Commentaries therupon.</p>

8. For first I found, that euen <hi>Luther</hi> himselfe, that did thus confidently triumph vpon alleadging of Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">Luther not euer belieued by vs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he cyte the Scriptures</note> all ancient Fathers, Thomists, Sophists, Henri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cistes, and the like, is not admitted nor followed by our English Church, in many of his maine positions of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, though we of England did, and do hould him for a great Saint, a flying Angell, one that had <hi>Primitias spiritus</hi> the prime spirit of the new Protestant Ghospell: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I haue heard some that haue presumed in their popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar pulpit declamations, amidst their owne Sectaries to inuest him with the tytle of a fifth Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelist: I say, he is not belieued by vs, though he cyte neuer so many Scriptures, and neuer so confidently in sundry weighty positions and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersies now in hand, as namely about the <hi>Reall presence</hi> wherein he most of all pretended, yea and had indeed fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himselfe vpon cleare and euident Scriptures. And is it any meruaile, when heresy departing from vnity, must needes breed variety, and cause diuersity betweene the Sect-maister and the Sectaries? the Father of innouation and the followers? the author of Schisme and the mantai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? the inuentors of nouelties and the imbracers thereof? Let vs heare what old <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith to the same aboue 1400. yeares agoe, when heresies were yet but yong and as it were in their infancy. <hi>Mentior</hi> (saith he) <hi>si non etiam àregulis suis variant inter se, dum vnusquis<expan>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:368:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> that was lawfull for <hi>Valentinus,</hi> and for the <hi>Marcionites,</hi> that was lawfull for <hi>Marcion</hi> to bring in an innouation in Religion at their pleasure. To conclude, all heresies being throughly looked into, are found in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things to dissent from the first Authors and broachers of them. Hitherto <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Can any more effectually prescription be made, then this, against the Heretickes of our daies? Do they not seeme to expresse and present the conditions and qualities of their ancient progenitors and forerunners? This then was my first cogitation, that albeit our English Protestants did well allow and admire that insolency in <hi>Luther</hi> of pressing Scriptures neuer so madly vnderstood, against Catholickes: yet when he vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged neuer so cleare Scriptures against themselues, and their opinions, they reiect and contemne both him and his Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Secondly, I considered that when the Diuell temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Christ he came not without his <hi>Scriptum est,</hi> he had the Word for his warrant, and therefore the lesse I meruailed <note place="margin">Abuse of Scriptures by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes.</note> that all Sectaries and Hereticks, from the very first foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Christan Religion, had principally founded themselues, and their heresies vpon pretence of Scripture, as may appeare by the seuerall workes of all the ancient Fathers, that confuted them: <hi>Frequentes sunt in citandis Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turis</hi> (saith <hi>Tertullian:)</hi> they are frequent in citing Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. They runne ouer the Law, Psalmes, Prophets, Ghospells, Epistles and the residue of holy Scripture with great facility (sayth <hi>Vincentius Lyrinensis)</hi> and euen <hi>in compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis &amp; conuiuijs,</hi> in market places and banquets, amongst their owne Sectaries, amongst strangers, priuatly, publickly in <note place="margin">

I had

                  <q> with a word or two (of false exposition) as with a drop of poyson, infect the whole, peruerting the true faith of Christ by their false sense of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that to their owne damnation, and damnation of their followers, as the Apostle <hi>S. Peter</hi> doth signify.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Thirdly, I considered that not onely the ancient Hereticks, but also the moderne Schismatickes and Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our time, did by the one and the same spirit appeale to the tribunall of Scriptures, and that both generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies grow end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing only to Scriptures</note> those of the Roman beliefe, &amp; particulerly among themselues, the one against the other, as <hi>Lutherans</hi> against <hi>Sacramentaries,</hi> and <hi>Sacramentaries</hi> against <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and those against these, and euery Sectary against his fellow, and all directly against God, his Church, and his Truth. And though ech Sectary professe to alledge Scripture, and pretendeth neyther to build vpon the sandes nor vpon the shore of priuate fancy, or his owne vnstable iudgment, but vpon the mayne rocke of God his word: yet Heresies grow on all sydes, and thereupon controuersies become endlesse and interminable. I remember not long since, that lighting vpon a little booke of the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> I fell vpon thirty places of plaine Scripture, and euery one of these places seemed by the externe letter, to make perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously for the aforsaid <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and their heresies, which yet in England we do condemne, and consequently doe
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:368:50"/>
hold all those places of Scriptures to be misalledged, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and falsely interpreted by them, be they neuer so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, seeme they neuer so plaine or pregnant.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But here I would demaund of any ingenious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant how the <hi>Anabaptist</hi> can euer be conuinced of his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies by any groundes of Protestant Religion? VVill the Protestant appeale him to the Scripture? The <hi>Anabaptist</hi> can produce more texts, and alleage more plentifull places of Scripture, then he can. Will he referre the interpretation of the places cyted on both sides to the spirit? The <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> presently presumeth and braggeth of a greater measure of the spirit then he. Will the Protestant accuse his spirit, as erroneous, and authour of a wrong interpretation, as <note place="margin">3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 22. 20. 21. 22. 23</note> 
                  <hi>Micheas</hi> truly charged the false Prophets of <hi>Iezabel,</hi> when he could them that <hi>Sathan</hi> had offered vnto Almighry God, that he would go forth, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all <hi>Achabs</hi> false prophets? Then will he reply againe, as <hi>Zidkiah</hi> did, <hi>And when departed the spirit of the Lord from me to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib. v.</hi> 24.</note> 
                  <hi>speake in thee?</hi> VVill he conuent him before the Consistory, and sribunall of the Protestant Church, &amp; Bishops ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as diuers haue bene, and were burned by them? The <hi>Anabaptist</hi> presently complayneth, and in this very iustly, that, it is no indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t kynd of tryall to be iudge in their owne cause. Finally will the Protestant remit it to the vmpiring of any other present Church, or be content that all Controuersies betwixt them shall fall to the decision of the Fathers? The <hi>Anabaptist</hi> kicketh against that, &amp; cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of all meanes of triall with this text of Scripture, <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualis</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>homo omnia dijudicat, &amp; ipse à nemine iudicatur.</hi> The spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall man iudgeth all thinges, and needeth not to be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of any. Thus we see euen amongst Sectaries the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, Controuersies grow endlesse by Scriptures, though all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to belieue Scriptures, and plentifully to cyte the same.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Moreouer where the <hi>Puritans</hi> actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>England</hi> swaicth most, as very vsually in good towns &amp; great citties it doth:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:368:50"/>
there shall you find all their Preachers of this humour, they haue nothing in their mouthes but the Ghospell of Christ, the Ghospell of Christ, the pure Word of the Lord, as though their false &amp; corrupted <hi>Geneuia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> Translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were eyther part of the Ghospell or Word of God. And they seeme so farre forth to confide to their English translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as that they affect to alleage Scriptures only, putting one vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the necke of an other, disdayning as it were to quote any Father or ancient writer for interpretation of Scriptures or confirmation of their doctrine, esteeming their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, though neuer so vaine and impertinent, to be firme groundes for building any thing thereon, as out of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And here I remember that not many moneths past perusing priuately with my selfe the foresaid booke of O. O. <hi>Emanuel,</hi> written by a Protestant against the <hi>Puritans</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Scriptures ridiculous<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Puritan.</note> he among other things discouereth vnto the <hi>German,</hi> with whome he maketh his Dialogue, some 15. seuerall places of Scripture, so falsely, and impertinently alleadged by Puritan writers, that the <hi>German</hi> is inforced to conclude, <hi>Thus I see already how ridiculous they are.</hi> And verily he that shall read the places alleadged, &amp; weigh them with any iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will confesse that they are ridiculously applyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and yet with their followers all must be Scriptures which they speake, and the pure word of God vttered by the instinct of the spirit, be it neuer so fantastically or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natically applyed.</p>
               <p n="14">14. VVell then, to come to the Conclusion, when I saw, and considered all this, and had weighed the same, with that indifferency of iudgement that I possibly could, as, in a matter so much impotting my soule, it stood me vpon; I began first to suspect this spirit of <hi>Luther,</hi> that auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red so confidently his assurance of the Scriptures, and true vnderstanding thereof, against a thousand <hi>Cyprians,</hi> a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Augustines,</hi> hauing no other ground thereof, then his owne particuler perswasion to that effect: which perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:368:51"/>

And thus much of this first Consideration. There followeth the second.</p>

               <head>The second Consideration.</head>
               <p>VVHEN Almighty God of his infinite goodnes &amp; mercy, after that immeasurable space of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, wherein the Blessed Trinity had raigned, &amp; glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously <note place="margin">That Scriptures were not writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for many yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Church began.</note> triumphed without any creatures, condescended to make a world, and to create man, and conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed therby to institute a visible society, company, or Church vpon earth, to acknowledge, serue, and honour him leauing vnto them sufficient directions whereby they might accomplish their seruice to him, and thereby to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue to the hauen of happines: the same most wise God gouerned the said Church for more then two thousand yeares, without any writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> word, that is now extant. And after this large space, when it pleased the Diuine Maiestie, that the history of the worlds creation, mans propagation &amp;c. should be committed to writing for the benefit of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding posterity, he stirred vp that great gouernour of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:368:51"/>
his people, and Prophet <hi>Moyses,</hi> inabled him with a great measure of his principall, and propheticall spirit, inspired him, and then appointed him to compyle those famous bookes commonly called in Greeke <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> the first fiue bookes of the Byble, to wit, <hi>Genesis</hi> the booke of creation, <hi>Exodus</hi> the booke of their departure out of <hi>Egipt, Leuiticus</hi> the booke of Priests and Sacrifices, <hi>Numeri</hi> the booke of numbring the people, and <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> the booke of the lawes repetition.</p>
               <p n="16">16. In like manner the same God, whose pleasure was euer <hi>to be with the sonnes of men,</hi> houlding the high hand of his diuine prouidence ouer his Church, inspired likwise and appointed others also after the example of <hi>Moyses,</hi> holy men, to compose and write other bookes afterwards vpon diuers, and sundry occasions offered, as in the ould Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be seene. But yet we shall not find, that any of those bookes of <hi>Moyses,</hi> or any of the rest, that were written by the other Authors were digested, and collected in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and method of orderly institutions, as in all other arts, and sciences is wont to be done, but rather by peece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale, and by parts as occasion fell out, the Authors ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of principally intending an historicall narration, rather then any exact doctrinall instruction: and the reason is this, for that the ordinary institution, and instruction of <note place="margin">How Scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures were first. written.</note> euery man how he ought to beleeue, liue, feare, and serue God, was for all this tyme (before the law written) to be taken only from the Church by traditions of Fathers to their children: and after the said law was written, also e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man, and woman was not remitted promiscuously, hand ouer head, to the reading of those bookes: but he was sent to take his instruction, and institution from the ordinary Superiours, Doctors, Gouernors of that Church and these were to expound the law vnto him. For which direction, and tradition we find this warrant and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding, yea prescribing authority, <hi>Aske thy Fathers, and</hi>

               <p n="17">17. And now to come from the law to the Ghospell, from <hi>Moyses</hi> vnto Christ, and so to proceed orderly with the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Church: as God is no changling, but euer like himselfe, euen so the beginning, proceeding, establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of the new Christian faith, and Church, was not much vnlike, if not altogeather resembling the former. For first this Church was planted by our Sauiour at <hi>Hierusalem</hi> and speedily by the industrious ministery of the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, assisted by the instinct of the holy Ghost, spread ouer the face of the earth: and yet neyther the Church, nor the Apostles, the principall pillars of the Church, had as at this time any written instruction or methodicall insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution deliuered vnto them, concerning their teaching, preaching, or beleeuing, except only the articles of the Creed, deliuered by tradition in the Church, as will appeare in the subsequent Considerations. Secondly, the institution that they had, they receyued it by instruction from our Sauiour his mouth, and from the immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, suggestion and inspiration of the holy Ghost; who was promised by Christ himselfe (who could not lie, nor deceaue) to assist the Church continually vnto the worldes end: and by this institution, and inspiration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 23. 20.</note> they taught, and conuerted both Iewes, and Gentils, instituted Churches, establishing lawes and orders of life by word of mouth, and tradition only from hand to hand before any thing of the new testament was committed to writing. And this was the condition of the Church for some yeares, and that in the infancy and purity of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, as the Protestant must perforce confesse. Thirdly, when the Wisdome of heauen thought it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, that somthing should be written, the first thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto writing in the new Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, was the Ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of <hi>S. Matthew,</hi> and this was collected, and digested in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:368:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that very order, as it is now presented to the Church, and that some eight yeares after the ascension of our Sauiour: then the Ghospell of <hi>S. Marke</hi> some fiue yeares after that: &amp; then that of <hi>S. Luke</hi> written twelue yeares after the former, wherin diuers thinges omitted in the other Ghospell of are recorded. And last of all was written the Ghospell of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> conteyning in it many great, and important mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which are not found in any of the rest: and this was not written of 66. yeares after the first visible Christian Church was planted, and established by the comming of the holy Ghost.</p>
               <p n="18">18. And now as all the rest were written vpon parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer <note place="margin">The Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rch conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares without written Scriptures</note> occasions, so especially was this famous Ghospell of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> which is the very key, opening the dore vnto the vnderstanding of all the rest, and particulerly vpon the occasion of <hi>Ebion,</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus</hi> their heresy, which impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Diuinity of the Sonne of God. Whereupon I do inferre, that for that which concerneth the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Church was for diuers yeares without any Scriptures at all: and for 66. yeares (which is the age of a man) the points related by <hi>S. Iohn</hi> more then were vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the other Ghospells (which are many and most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant) were receiued and belieued in the Church by tradition onely. And now for Conclusion of all, I would demaund but one thing of the Protestants, that make such shew of appealing vnto Scriptures, and the Primitiue A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall Church: &amp; this was dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded aboue 1400. yeares agoe by <hi>S.

yeares in the time of the law, and for many other yeares in the dayes of the Ghospell; and that in the brest of the Church, to be deliuered by tradition only without the help of any word written?</p>
               <p n="19">19. Wherby we cannot but discerne, and must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Scriptures or the written word of God, were not so absolute necessary for the reuealing of God his will vnto man kind, and the continuing of man in that sauing knowledge of him: but that his Diuine Maiesty might haue propagated, and preserued his doctrine, and man in the truth by tradition only of word of mouth, without any Scriptures at all, if it had so pleased him, as he did for many ages and generations togeather, both before the first great diluge by water, in the dayes of our first Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes, vntill <hi>Abraba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And the like he might haue done with Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to the worlds great generall consummation &amp; last inundation by a flood of fire (according to <hi>S. Irenaeus</hi> his sentence) if he had listed, as hauing instituted a more orderly, exact, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Church; yea, and hauing indued it with greater pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges, according to the perfection of the new law, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the old, then he had done vnto the former of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> Whereupon it must needes follow by force of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary consequence, that the tradition of this Church, and pure authority therof, both in propounding Scriptures vnto vs, and discerning the same which are truly Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and which are not, as also for deliuering vnto vs the true sense, and meaning therof in their interpretation, and exposition, is much more to be respected by vs then was that of the Iewes. Forasmuch as Christ our Sauiour promised the continuall assistance of his spirit vnto this Church, and that in such measure, as that it should alone
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:368:53"/>
be able to withstand all the infernall power of <hi>Sathan,</hi> and the gates of hell, <hi>idest,</hi> the very entrance of all kynd of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, or herely into it whatsoeuer.</p>
               <p n="20">20. These then, that neuer so solemnely and neuer so <note place="margin">How He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks do handle Scripturs.</note> confidently professe that they for their partes do belieue, and follow the Scriptures, without due reference, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the Church, forsomuch as all Sectaries, and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikcs, that are no Catholicke Christians do professe the same, as hath bene already euidently shewed, that is to say, they will openly beare the world in hand, that they build their whole Religion vpon the maine foundation of the Scriptures: wheras notwithstanding it is out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion that they rather build vpon their owne idle heades and fanaticall spirits; forsomuch as they deduce their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of Scriptures, and the interpretation thereof from their owne braine, sense, and priuate fancy, and not from any more stable authority at all.</p>
               <p n="21">21. This is made euident, and perspicuous, if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nmine any the least sect, or sectary in the world, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare many of sundry sectes togeather, for that euery one of them, though as opposite among themselues, as heauen and hell, light and darkenes, God and Beliall: yet will all pretend to build vpon God his word, all will appeale vnto Scriptures, the <hi>Lutheran, Caluiuist, Anabaptist, Brownist, Protestant,</hi> and euery other sectary: but when you tye them to the point, bring them to the examination of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, question them concerning these two particulers, to wit, which is Scripture, &amp; how it is to be vnderstood, then do they appeare in the liuely colours of Heretickes, then do they discouer their owne hereticall fancies to be both all, and the chiefe groundes, that euer they had to build their religion vpon, as by the ensuing Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will better appeare in both the heads before touched.</p>

               <head>The third Consideration.</head>
               <p>IF the Oracle of the Prophets, and Apostles, the diuine VVrit, I meane so called, because the holy Scriptures were written by the ministery of Propheticall, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall men, be in their owne nature of that sublime ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and transcendent eminency, as hath bene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <note place="margin">How to know what is truly Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</note> decyphered and discouered vnto vs: If the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the said sacred Writ be not humane, but diuine, not the word of any mortall ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor proceding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spirit, but the word of the immortall God, breathed no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his heauenly spirit: and consequently, if it be not in it selfe most holy, sacred, sure, certaine, and of infallible truth; then let vs assuredly know, that as on the one side, it is a capitall crime of sacriledge to decree any thing for Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is not, or to intrude any humane writing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the participation or association of Gods Diuine word: so it is a sinne no lesse damnable on the other side to call rashly into question, or to disauthorize any part, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of that which is Scripture indeed, or to deny therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the honour due to diuine and sacred Writ: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it highly importeth vs aswell in the one as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to mannage our selues with all humility, sobriety, modesty, and circumspection, in a matter so weighty as the Scripture is, and so neerely concerning the eternall saluation or damnation of our soules.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Now then if the point standeth thus, it behoueth vs indeed (if in any other matter, then especially in this) to vse all carefull and exact diligence, that we may find out that certaine rule, and infallible direction before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that by the immediate guidance thereof we may most certainely attaine vnto this, to wit, to know, what is truly Scripture and what is not: &amp; if euer this were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,

then much more in these later and worser daies, and times of schisme and heresie, when as no small contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies are stirred vp about the same.</p>
               <p n="24">24. For wheras so many dangerous Sects, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of perdition (to speake in the phrase of the holy Ghost) <note place="margin">The place is aboue ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> are raised vp from hell in these our vnfortunate times (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate indeed in respect or them,) and that within the compasse of one age, since one luxurious <hi>Luther</hi> opened the first gappe to the generall detection; all which schismes, and heresies (as before hath bene notifyed) couertly shroud themselues vnder the name and pretensed veile of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: the first contention, and now most necessary questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">How to know what is Scripture and what is not.</note> to be discussed with them, is what books of the Bible or partes therof are truely Scripture, &amp; what are to be wiped away, &amp; to be cut offro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sacred Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of holy writ: and all to this end, that we may vndoubtedly, know vpon what groundes we may stand safely, in citing authorities from thence.</p>
               <p n="25">25.

               <p n="26">26. The second into such bookes, as albeit some men did for some time doubt, whether they were Canonicall or not; yet afterwardes they are receiued into Canon by the whole Church: that is, held for diuine books, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the spirit of God, and of such infallible truth, as they may be a Canon or rule, or sure direction vnto our infirmity, for any thing that is found in them. For so <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> from the Etimology of the word describeth the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:368:55"/>
meaning of the word <hi>Canonicall,</hi> being applied as a fit Epe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thete vnto the Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="27">27. The third order is into such bookes, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they go ordinary in the common Bibles, and containe in them many good morall instructions of piety, and were sometimes by some particuler men estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for essentiall partes of the Scripture: yet were they neuer so accompted by the vniuersall Church, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are called <hi>Apecrypha,</hi> that is hidden or obscure, for that their authority was neuer receaued, or published generally in the Church, and for such are reckoned the third and fourth of <hi>Esdras,</hi> the Appendix of the booke of <hi>Iob,</hi> the booke of <hi>Hieremy,</hi> intituled <hi>Pastor,</hi> the prayer of King <hi>Manasses,</hi> and finally the 151. <hi>Psalme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28. I say now, this tripartite diuision of holy Writ, being thus generally admitted, and receiued by all ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe Deuines, doth it not concerne euery man that is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of his soules saluation, to inquire diligently after the pursuite and knowledg of these things, especially in this generall sommoning, and appealing of all vnto the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for the finall decision of all Controuersies?</p>
               <p n="29">29. And now to speake something to the point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these three rankes and orders of books. The third <note place="margin">What books are now in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersy.</note> of these is generally reiected by all, as well Catholickes as Protestants: the first is admitted by all. All the question then is concerning the second, and this comprehendeth sundry bookes both of the old and new Testament, as of <hi>Hester, Baruch,</hi> certaine parcelles of <hi>Daniel,</hi> the bookes of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bias, Iudith, Sapientia, Ecclesiasticus,</hi> and the first and second of <hi>Machabees</hi> out of the ould Testament, and certaine parts of the Ghospell of <hi>S. Marke, S. Luke,</hi> and <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> with the Epistles of <hi>S. Iames, S. Iude,</hi> the 2. of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> the 2. and 3. of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> and the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> out of the new. All these I say are receiued by those of the Roman Religion for Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Scriptures, in the sense before defined out of <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine:</hi> that is to say, for holy and diuine bookes, written
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:368:55"/>
by the finger of Almighty God, by the ministery of those who were <hi>Pennes of a ready writer,</hi> and consequently these of the second ranke, were of no lesse authority, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible verity, then those of the first order, for that in things immediatly, and a like proceeding from God his spirit, there can not be lesse or more truth, but all are of equall credit, and so equally to be receaued, honoured, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed, and belieued. And thus much for the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes, who for a infallible ground, and assured directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this matter follow not any priuate erring spirit, but the neuer-deceiuing authority of the Church; which Church and spouse of Christ being guided by the spirit of God, according to the promise of Christ her bridegrome, hath from all ancient time in former ages, in her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, Synodes, and Ecclesiasticall Decrees, notified, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, determined, and established the authority of these foresaid bookes of the second rew for infallible and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall: that is to say, declared them to be such, and euer haue bene such, to wit, of most certaine and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble truth, though sometimes and amongst some men there haue bene doubt thereof. And this is the manner of the Church to declare what is Scripture, but not to make it.</p>
               <p n="30">30. But as for the Protestants, I find such diuersity and contrariety, such opposition, and contradiction among them, that they seeme vnto me as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in tangled, shall I say, nay perplexed, and distracted, not knowing what to doe, or whither to fly, or which way to turne them in this great busines of discerning, and admitting Scriptures.

               <p n="37">37.

               <p n="38">38. The like dispute I might propose about other bookes, or partes of Scriptures, and namely concerning the Epistle of <hi>S.

The second, which is that mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call booke of the Reuelation composed by that high-soa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and Egale-winged <hi>Iohn, S.

And this Consideration may be presumed to haue beene an especiall motiue vnto those chiefe <hi>Lutherans</hi> the <hi>Magdeburgians,</hi> causing them to forsake both their Father <hi>Luther,</hi> and their <hi>Lutheran</hi> brethren in this cause, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre, and conioyne themselues with <hi>Caluin,</hi> and the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinists</hi> in defence of the Apocalyps.</p>
               <p n="39">39. And yet I do not perceiue how his Maiesties as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion here about these bookes, doth not rather agree with the <hi>Lutherans</hi> then with the <hi>Caluinistes,</hi> for so much as he holdeth all those bookes for <hi>Apocrypha</hi> &amp; no Canonicall Scripture, which are named by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to be <hi>secundiordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis:</hi> in which second order (as before hath beene declared) the <hi>Cardinall</hi> comprehendeth also these Epistles, to wit, the Epistles to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> that of <hi>S.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:368:59"/>
these for no Canonicall Scriptures. And this is contrary vnto <hi>Caluin,</hi> and vnto the Church of England, and vnto his Maiesty himselfe: for he auoucheth them to be Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and so vpon my knowledge doth the present Church of England. And lastly his Maiesties so long standing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> in this his <hi>Premonition,</hi> doth well shew that he esteemeth it for Scripture: and this contradiction also must light vpon him, who against knowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science (if he hath eyther) wrongfully suggested the place of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> vnto his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>.</p>
               <p n="40">40. But my maine Conclusion of all is this, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be certaine, as here it is sufficiently prooued, <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration</note> when a man once departeth from the Authority of the Church (for this is a certaine rule vnto all, &amp; such a rule as is authorized by God himselfe:) for then euery man may make and vnmake Scripture at their pleasure, &amp; vpon their owne perill. But sure I am, that he can ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giue, nor take away diuine authority from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And if you say, that neyther the Church can do this, I demaund first, who art thou that comparest thy self with the whole Church? I graunt it to be true, but yet let me tell thee this withall, that though the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not giue diuine authority to any writing which from the beginning was not truely Scripture, nor take away the same from any part of that, which from the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was Scripture: yet may the Church declare what bookes were written by Propheticall or Apostolicall men, as before hath bene said, and consequently by the finger of the holy Ghost, and so were Canonicall Scriptures, and of infallible truth: and this might the Church know partly by tradition (others not knowing the same, might without suspition of heresy doubt of their authority be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the said declaration of the Church) and partly also by the euer guiding assistance of the holy Ghost in her Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes, when any such weighty matters, for direction of the whole Church, were treated: in which Councells

the said Church after due inquisition made, and inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Ghost (as her common custome is) might no lesse conclude, and bind all with <hi>Visum est Spiritui Sancto, &amp; Nobis,</hi> then did they of the first Councell in the Actes of the Apostles, which no priuate man hath authority to do, though <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> presumed to determine the same.</p>

               <head>The fourth Consideration.</head>
               <p>THE briefe summe of all hitherto treated of in this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter concerning the Scriptures, is in effect <note place="margin">How the true sense of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be tryed.</note> thus much: first, euery belieuing &amp; appealing vnto Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, is not sufficient to proue a man a Christian Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, for that ech Sectary doth offer this.

               <p n="47">47.

And thus will they fly through the law, and the psalmes, the Prophets, and Apostles, as <hi>Vincentius</hi> noteth of the Heretickes of his time, to proue the facility of the Scriptures.

               <p n="48">48. For otherwise how commeth it to passe, that all Christendome is in an vprore about the exposition of Scriptures? How grow so many contentions amongst the learned at this day? Why haue we so desperate, and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heresies, grounded (as the heretickes thinke) vpon such apparent, and pregnant places of Scripture, as that the Authors thereof (being deceaued themselues, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing others by the Scriptures) will rather desperatly choose to loose their liues, &amp; their soules togeather, then to forgoe, and abiure their opinions in matter of religion, which once by the least apparent shew of Scripture, they haue begunne to defend: These men though neuer so learned, neuer so wise, neuer so morally vertuous, yet are they deceiued. Shall I say by Scripture? nay rather they wilfully by their owne hereticall choice against the knowne interpretation of Catholicke Church, Roman Church, ancient Church, abuse the Scriptures, and so are deceaued, intangled, blindfolded: and this they could neuer be brought vnto, if the Scriptures were so easy that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:368:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a priuate spirit might interprete without the publicke spirit, and interpretation of the Church. And to this <hi>S. Augustine</hi> alludeth, saying: <hi>Multis &amp; multiplicibus obscurita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, &amp; ambiguitatibus decipiuntur, qui temerè legunt Scripturas,</hi>

The vnderstanding then, and true sense of the Scriptures is the very mayne point which importeth and importuneth vs for our saluation: and in seeking out this, if euer by seeking we meane to find it, we must first abandon our owne iudgment, and particuler election, and imbrace the common &amp; publicke iudgment of Christ his Church: This is the interpreter of the Scriptures, this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller and guider of all certayne and sure exposition: <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petit<expan>

               <p n="50">50. <hi>S.

Whence I do obserue, that if we receiue the Ghospell vpon the credit of the Church, for that the Ghospell would not be belieued to be the Ghospell, vnlesse the authority of the Church did tell vs that it were the Ghospell: then followeth it necessarily (for the argument is drawne <hi>àmaiore ad minus)</hi> that much more should we depend and rely vpon the Church, and take from her the true sense, meaning, and exposition of the Ghospell, from whom we haue belieued and receaued that it is the Ghospell: and therefore saith the same Father
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:368:62"/>
to his friend Honoratns: <hi>Multò facilius mihi persuaderem, Christo non esse credendum, quàm de illo quidquam, nisi ab his, per quos credidissem, esse credendum.</hi> I should much more easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my selfe, that we ought not to beleeue in Christ at all, then that any thing were to be learned co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning him, of any man, but only of those whom I was taught to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue in Christ. Can any thing be spoken more effectually for the Authority of the Church, since this is the sole cause of his belieuing the Ghospell? This is the onely motiue of his imbracing the faith of Christ?</p>
               <p n="51">51. But now whether Protestants do follow this trade, and way of true Catholicisme in their sensing, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of Scriptures, that is not hard to discouer. For when wee come to particuler controuersies, and to ioyne issue togeather, and that they and their aduersaries do alleage Scriptures, and expound the same; then doth it <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes and Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the sense of Scripture.</note> appeare, as cleare as the sunne, who followeth a priuate interpretation, and who adhereth to the true Catholicke Churches exposition. For the Roman Catholicke first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syring to find out the truth, and then willing to imbrace nothing but the truth, reflecteth vpon the former inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of ancient Church, when the present contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersy was not yet in hand; and consequently when the exposition cannot be so much as in any semblable reason suspected to be wrested, or wrongly interpreted by men of those ages (who neither feared, nor fauoured any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) but must needes be according to the common meaning and sense of the Church in those ancient tymes: and this interpretation (which the Protestants also in some of their better humours do admit for good) the Catholicke fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth; &amp; vpon this, as vpon the rock of God his word, truly sensed by the Church, he stayeth himselfe, &amp; buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his religion.</p>
               <p n="52">52. Now the Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t being guilty in his conscience, and knowing well, that antiquity detesteth, and hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready anathematized his heresy, he by all meanes possible,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:368:63"/>
by vociferatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and exclamations seeketh to extenuate the authority of this Church (much like to the theefe or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, who arested by the law to abyde the triall of the same, beginneth to raile, &amp; exclaime against his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ludge, and iurours:) and then in his imagination he deuiseth certaine <hi>Chymera's</hi> and <hi>Idea's</hi> of his Church in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, in the ayre, of his owne braine, which line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, saith he (but God knoweth how, for he knoweth not) descended vnto <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Caluin &amp;c.</hi> And from these people partly, and partly from himselfe frameth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant his exposition of Scripture, and vpon this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion buildeeh he all his religion of his owne deuice.</p>
               <p n="53">53. And albeit all Fathers do not allwaies agree in one and the selfe same sense, and exposition of Scripture (for that there may be be diuers senses of one &amp; the selfe same place of Scripture, as before you haue heard at large:) yet doth the holy Ghost so rune, and strike vpon the stringes, the tonges and pens, I meane of these ancient Wortnies of the Church, that all the variety, that euer I could find yet amongst them, sounded forth a heauenly harmony, and neither iarred, not yet was dissonant from Scripturs verity, or faiths Analogy: so farre is the Churches vnity from all contrariety. And verily this diuersity of antiquity in the execution of Scriptures without all repugnancy, or any contrariety, was no small motiue vnto me to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the present Roman Catholicke Religion (which all so I found in them) for I could not but conclude, that as one spirit breathing out these Scriptures, intended all these senses: so the same spirit guided all. And therefore no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, that neither the ages, wherin such Fathers liued, nor any succeeding Century of the Church reprehended their expositions. For the wisedome of the spirit euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Church, and thereby they know that such variety breeded no contrariety; whilst one Father sensed the Scripture literally another Allegorically, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mystically, or Anagogically; but yet all to a pious

Ambrose, S. Hierome,</hi> and other learned Fathers, who wanted neyther learning, nor zeale, to haue both matched him, and confuted him, had he swarued in ought from sound faith, and the doctrine of their present Church:) and consequently <hi>Purgatory</hi> was then held for no errour or heresy. And the like I might aboundantly proue in many other pointes, both out of <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> and sundry other of like antiquity, learning, and sanctity.</p>
               <p n="59">59. Finally the conclusion of all this mayne Chapter, and Treatise of sacred Scriptures, must of necessity fall out to be this: that not all belieuing of Scriptures, nor appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> vnto Scripture, nor sensing of Scriptures, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming of the spirit, is sufficient to make a man a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Catholick, for that as hath beene formerly noted forth of <hi>S.

in Councell being ech of them seuerally replenished with the holy Ghost, and all of them ioyntly directed by the selfe same neuer-erring spirit, who was both now, and euer in such assemblies as these, to sit as President in the Church: I say, being thus prepared, euery one proposed as he belieued, and all being put togeather in the vpshot, did make the shot, or symbole of a breife, yet entire me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodicall summe of Christian doctrine, including all points of faith, either to be preached afterwardes by the Apostles, or to be belieued by their disciples.

               <p n="6">6. Thus <hi>S. Augustine</hi> (whose sense I haue kept, though I haue somewhat dilated vpon his wordes) relateth the matter, which before him had beene recorded by <hi>Ruffinus,</hi>

And in this acception also of the word, it consorteth well to our present purpose, that by this briefe summe of Doctrine as by a badge, or cognisance, true Catholicke Christian men may be distinguished heere from Infidels, and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, since after death there is such an externall distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and separation to be made. And for this purpose at the beginning this Creed serued, but afterwards charity, &amp; the loue of God, and Christian piety decaying, and the malice of men exceedingly multiplying vpon the earth, this breife, and playne summe would not serue the turne,

It is also to be considered, that it is most worthy of a Christian man his obseruation, especially, if he hath eyther care, or make any conscience to preserue himselfe <note place="margin">The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall Creed no Scripture &amp; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> sound in the faith, and therby to saue his soule; that albeit, the ancient Fathers do with vniforme verdict affirme that these articles of the Apostolicall Creed, were set downe by the holy Apostles, replenished and directed with no small measure of the holy Ghost, as now hath bene obserued (I will not stand to discusse at this present, whether euery seuerall article of the twelue which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth, were set dowue by seuerall Apostles, though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers graue, and ancient Fathers do affirme it:) yet were these articles neuer held for Canonicall Scripture, no nor yet are they at this day, eyther by Catholicke or Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant. And if any man reply, that they are consonant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Scriptures, and may be thence deduced, I deny not that, only I say this is nothing to argue that authority that they haue obteyned in the Church, since that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writings of orthodox men are both consonant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Scriptures, and to be deduced from them, and yet they are not held in that esteeme, as the Creed: but my conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that hereupon I inferre, is this, that something must be graunted of necessity besides Canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to haue bene necessarily belieued in the Christian Catholicke Church, and that by tradition only; without any other foundaation, and that from the very beginning

of Christian Religion.</p>
               <p n="9">9. This appeareth by the former words of <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> that this Creed came down along through the Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>turies of the Church by tradition, and <hi>Ruffinus</hi> saith in his expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Creed: <q>
                     <hi>Idcirco haec nonscripta funt chartulis, at<expan>

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> &amp; therfore did the Apostles deliuer these thinges not written in paper and parchment, but to be retayned in mens hartes, to the end it might be certaine, that no man should by reading haue the same, for that writinges are accustomed to come also into the handes of Infidels, aswell as Christians, but that it should be sufficient to haue learned the same from the tradition of the Apostles.</q> And this is the reason that <hi>Ruffinus</hi> giueth of the tradition of the Creed.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The very same hath <hi>S. Hierome:</hi> his wordes are cleare. <hi>In Symbolo fidei, &amp; spei nostrae</hi> (saith he) <hi>non scribitur in chartis, &amp; atramento, sed in tabulis cordis carnalibus &amp;c.</hi> In the Creed that conteineth our fayth and hope, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliuered by tradition from the Apostles, is not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <note place="margin">The force of tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Church.</note> in paper and inke, but in the fleshly tables of our harts &amp;c. And all this doth euidently conuince vnto the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any vnderstanding man, that these articles of the Apostolick Creed were deliuered by word of mouth vnto Christians, and the Church was put in trust with them to teach them vnto her children before that any Scripture of the new Testament was committed to writing, and that many thinges of great moment about the mysteries of Christian Religion were left to be vnderstood, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded therin, and that according to the wisedome, learning, and iudgment of the whole Catholick Church, especially concerning Sacraments, which are not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. And this is the cause why <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> and other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before him do often reiterate, and frequently vse that impsoving kynd of speach, <hi>Norum fideles,</hi> the faithful do know, what belongeth vnto these matters, which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely they did not reueale vnto the eares of new Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:368:70"/>
least infidels might take any aduantage thereby to the disaduantage of the Church. So as my conclusion of this must of necessity hould correspondence with that former conclusion touching the argument of Scriptures, to wit: whosoeuer he be, that neuer so ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, &amp; plainly professeth that he doth accept, admit, and belieue this Creed of the Apostles, but refuseth the vnderstanding thereof, expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Church, and deliuered in her sense, he belieueth it not at all to saluation: neither shall it auaile him any more to admit the words and not receiue the sense, then if at once, and altogeather he reiected both wordes and sense.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And here may some demaund: But where now shall we be sure to find this exposition of the Church, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially <note place="margin">A questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> solued where the voice of the Church may be found.</note> in these distracted times of schisme, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so many seuerall Sects plead for the Church, crying out according to Christ his Propheticall prediction, <hi>Here is Christ,</hi> and <hi>there is Christ,</hi> heere is the Church, &amp; there is the pure Chos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, here is the word truly preached, &amp; there are the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments sincerely administred &amp;c? To this I answere, we shal easily come by this orthodox exposition of the Creed, if we haue recourse vnto the publike doctrine of the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from age to age, euen vntill our time throughout euery Century of the Church: and this Church is euer vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, vnlesse it be vnto such, as are blind, as <hi>S.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:368:71"/>
and meaning of this Apostolicke Creed, and consequently if our English ministry, who at their Ordination do sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe vnto this Creed, would follow also the same dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for the true vnderstanding, and sense thereof, all matters would quickly be reconciled, &amp; controuersies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded: but in default of this, and for that pride, and selfe will, hath so be witched the minds of many, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in humility stoop downe their priuate censures, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the publike iudgement of the Church, it commeth to passe, that this great discord and difference (that now is) raygneth betwixt Catholicks &amp; Protestants, and amongst Protestants themselues, concerning the exposition thereof. And this shall appeare in part in the next ensuing Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of this Chapter. But yet before we enter into the other Consideration, we shall speake a word or two of the other Creedes, mentioned here by his Maiesty.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The other Creedes then, are the <hi>Nieene</hi> (concluded <note place="margin">De fide ad Gratian.</note> as <hi>S.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:368:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
some 15. yeares after that againe, wherein there is found that exact manner of speach, distinguishing the persons of the Blessed Trinity: <hi>Qualis Pater, talis Filius, talis Spiritus Sanctus:</hi> Such as the Father is, such is the Sonne, and such is the holy Ghost: and then he setteth downe more particuler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the distinctiue appellations and peculiar proprieties belonging vnto euery person: as the Father vnbegotten, the Sonne begotten of the Father, the holy Ghost procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; asmuch, as if in plaine tearmes he had said, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther distinguished with this personall propriety of beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Sonne is a Father, and no Sonne: the Sonne distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished with his personall propriety of being begotten, is a Sonne and not a Father: the holy Ghost distinguished by his personall propriety of proceeding, is an holy Ghost, &amp; neyther Father nor Sonne.</p>
               <p n="14">14. By all which we see the exceeding great authority of the Church in determining these different manners of speach, in disclosing this ineffable and inutterable my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Trinity, which are not found at all, <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> in the Scriptures, and therefore were denied by the Scripturian Heretickes (for as learned <hi>Hosius</hi> noteth, and it is the obseruation of <hi>S.

               <p n="15">15. VVell then, we see that the former mysteries of the Diety and Trinity could be determined by no other power and authority vpon earth, then by that supreme
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:368:72"/>
power of the Church, for that expresse warrant of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there was none in their pretence: for many of these wordes that are now vsed, and frequented by the Church in the explication of these Creedes, were not then in vse, but inuented and applied afterwads by the Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the present necessity. And yet notwithstanding haue they beene so acknowledged, and receaued euer since by all Christendome, that the authority of the Church in that behalfe determining and expounding, hath stood inuiolable: and such as haue not admitted the same, haue euer beene reputed, and accompted for wicked, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Heretickes. And this is to be noted with attention, as before I haue partly touched in generall, that albeit the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> representing the whole Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church of that age, did not, nor could not make any new article of beliefe, that was not true before, but only did more fully, and plainely explane, and declare such things, as the impudency, and importunity of Heretickes called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to doubt and question: so did not the said Councell ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne all that belonged to the diuine persons, for they left at <hi>Credo in Spiritum sanctum,</hi> I belieue in the holy Ghost, and there brake of, not vnfoulding any thing particuler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">The great authority left in the Church for deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies.</note> touching the procession of the holy Ghost from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Sonne (about which there was afterwards so great strife and contention, and is to this day, with the later obstinate Greekes, affirming the same Person to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed only from the Father, &amp; not from the Sonne) but left that by Gods prouidence to be expounded afterwardes by other Councells, when that poynt should be called into question, and so it was. So that it is more then euident vnto euery one, that will not wilfully shut his eyes against the cleare sunne shine of truth, that there is left continuall power in the Church to explayne and determine with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and that irrefragable, and vnresistable, any doubt neuer so weighty, about the Persons of the Trinity, or any other article of beliefe, or any other high point of diuine
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:368:72"/>
mystery, that shall arise among Christians, and that vnto the worlds last ending: &amp; euery one vnder paine of da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble obedience against Christs spouse, and the holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the director thereof, is bound to submit, and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate his iudgment, and vnderstanding thereto, and not to stand in contention against the same. And thus much of these three <hi>Creedes</hi> in generall, how they are to be reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced: now let vs descend vnto the seuerall articles, and positions therof in particuler.</p>

                  <hi>Creedes,</hi> how they are receiued and belieued. You haue heard before how the Ministers of the Church of England do subscribe vnto the same at their Ordination. Now let vs examine, whether this English Cleargy, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all their subscription thereunto, do indeed truly be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lieue them, and expound them in the selfe same sense, interpretation, and meaning, as the Generall Councells, and ancient Fathers that collected them, meant them, as they do perswade his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> they do. A man would think, that so solemne an Oath taken before an Ecclesiasticall Iudge, at the Tribunall of the Church, and that for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of Religion, and conseruaaion of the integrity of ancient faith laid downe in ancient Creedes, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councells, should religiously bynd before God and men, people of their quality and condition: but behold heresy that neither feareth God, nor reuetenceth man, obserueth no band at all, but draweth euery thing to euery mans particuler iudgment, and censure: and therefore it doth little auaile the ministers of the Church of England to reuerence, and receaue the wordes of the Creed, whilst

they reiect the Churches sense, and true meaning of the same, to sweare vnto them in wordes by subscription at their Ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but to forsweare them in deedes by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse, and sinister interpretation, and exposition.

And this we haue already proued by the vnanime verdict of <hi>S. Athanasius, S. Basill, S. Nazianzen, S. Hierome, S. Augustine</hi> and others: which <hi>S.

                  <hi>Free-will,</hi> and of the <hi>Nouatians,</hi> who would not grant that Priestes had authority in the Church to remit sinnes. All which ancient heresies (with many more which I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely omit) being held in like manner in some degree or other, yea defended with great resolution by our English Ministers, they cannot be accompted to belieue entirely and inuiolably the Catholick faith, and Creeds, which condemne all these for heresies.</p>
               <p n="23">23. And furthermore if besides this, we will but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the variety and multiplicity of other new sects of these our dayes, with which our English Ministers do par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate, and make open profession to communicate, as with their brethren: we shall diserne clearely, that they cannot so much as pretend to hould the sincere integrity of one only faith. And the reason is, for that they haue euer hitherto admitted for brethren, and men of one faith, the <hi>Lutherans</hi> for example, who expressely condemne them for hereticks, and professe in the open eares of the world themselues to dissent really from them in diuers weighty, and capitall pointes, as touching the <hi>Reall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, the person of Christ, Iustification, freewill, the law, the Ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,</hi> and many other more of like nature, as by their owne bookes, and writings doth appeare. And how then may they be sayd to agree with the sense, and meaning of <hi>S. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi> his Creed, which pronounceth damnation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all such, as do not faithfully, and firmely hould the whole entyre Catholicke faith, without any violation, in any one article at all? And so let vs passe vnto the two other Creedes, to wit, vnto that of the Councell of <hi>Nyce,</hi> and the Apostlicall.</p>
               <p n="24">24. In the Nicene Creed, for the better, and further explication of Christ his Godhead, and equality with his Father, against the <hi>Arian</hi> heresie, there are certaine wordes purposely deuised, and set downe by the said Councell, and they be these that follow: <hi>Deum de Deo, Lumen de lumine, Deum verum de Deo vero &amp;c.</hi> That is, God of God, Light of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:368:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Light, true God of true God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father &amp;c. By all which words, the meaning of the sacred Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell is not only to proue the <note place="margin">About the Nicene Creed.</note> Equality of Godhead, betwixt the Father and the Sonne, most blasphemously impugned, and denyed by the <hi>Arians</hi> but further to illustrate the very identity of essence imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, soly, &amp; wholy communicated from the Father vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sonne, in his eternall generation: and therfore do those thrice blessed Fathers call Christ <hi>Lumen de Lumine,</hi> to intimate thus much vnto our vnderstanding, for the better comprehending of that mystery, that as a light importeth his whole, full, and perfect light vnto another, and yet retayneth the whole in it selfe: euen so in that mysticall and inscrutable generation of God the Sonne begotten of God the Father, the Father as a light imparteth vnto the Sonne, as a another Light (in regard of his distinctiue Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall substance) his whole light, that is, his whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre nature, essence, substance and Godhead, without se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, diuision, motion, mutation, or alteration in the Father (according to that of <hi>S.

               <p>OVR third &amp; last Consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this present Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">In what particuler article of the Creed English Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with vs.</note> shall insist vpon sundry articles of the Apostles Creed in particuler, wherein the Ministers of England (that make a profession, and that by subscription to admit the whole Creed as it lieth) do notwithstanding differ from the sense, interpretation, and exposition of ancient Church: and to exemplify some particuler article, the fifth Article is, <hi>Descendit ad inferos:</hi> Christ descended into hell, which the ancient Fathers did vnderstand litterally, as it lieth (for so all the articles of the Creed are literally
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:368:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be expounded) to wit that our Sauiour Christ after the consummation of our Redemption by the pretious bloud of his passion, leauing his body in the Sepulcher, he des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded victoriously like a triumphant conquerour of death, Sathan, and all the power of hell, with his soule into the lower partes of the earth; shewing and exhibiting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe thereby a conquerour of death, and deliuering from thence diuers prisoners, and namely the soules of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, Patriarkes, and Prophets, who ardently expected his comming to open vnto them the gates of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen according to that in the Hymne of <hi>Te Deum</hi> (which is in wordes acknowledged by the Church of England) <hi>VVhen thou hadst ouercome the sharpnes of death, thou didest open the Kingdome of Heauen to all beleeuers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="27">27. Thus the ancient Church vnderstood this article, as may be easily proued by vnamine consent of all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that expounded it so. For first the fourth Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell <note place="margin">About Christs desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding into hell.</note> of <hi>Toledo cap.</hi> 1. and the <hi>Lateran</hi> gathered vnder <hi>Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> the third expound the Article so, as appeareth by their wordes, plaine to that purpose: <hi>Descendit ad inferos, vt animas quae illic tenebantur erueret:</hi> Christ descended into hell that he might deliuer the soules which were detayned there.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Secondly, <hi>Thaddeus</hi> one of Christs 70. Disciples, who as he liued in the very time of the Apostles, so was it most like, nay it could not be otherwaies, but he knew the Apostolicall sense of this article, and yet he (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> recordeth) deliuereth the sense thus, <hi>Descendit ad inferos, &amp; disrupit maceriem, quam in saeculo nemo disruperat: qui descendit quidem solus, ascendit autem cum grandi multitudine.</hi> Christ des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended <note place="margin">

                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:368:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
29. With <hi>Thaddaus</hi> agreeth <hi>Ignatius,</hi> another great Saint and Martyr, that liued immediatly after the Apostles, and had conuersation with some of them. <hi>Descendit solus</hi> (sayth <note place="margin">In epist. ad Trallian.</note> the same Father) <hi>ascendit cum grandi multitudine.</hi> Christ des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into hell alone, but he ascended with a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. With these two so ancient so Apostolicall men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth <hi>Iustinus Martyr</hi> an ancient and renowned Author, in the selfe same age next after the Apostles, who in his conference or dispute <hi>cum Triphone Iudaeo</hi> (for so is his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue intituled) complayneth of the impiety of the Iewes, for razing forth the testimony of <hi>Hieremy,</hi> where our Lord is said to descend to hell, <hi>vt liberaret mortuos suos,</hi> that he might deliuer his dead thence.</p>

               <p n="32">32. And yet do the Protestants of our vnhappie time differ from all these in the vnderstanding of this Article of Christ his descent into hell, though they do professe to admit the whole Creed. And amongst the rest, the very wordes of this Article of the Creed: for some of them, <hi>by descending into hell,</hi> vnderstand that he descended into his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher: this is the opinion of <hi>Bucer,</hi> that was <hi>Regius Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Bucer. in cap. 27. Matth.</note> and publike reader of Diuinity in <hi>Cambridge</hi> in King Edward the sixt his dayes: and the same houldeth <hi>Beza</hi> in his Commentary vpon the second Chapter of the Actes of the Apostles. And <hi>Caluin</hi> himselfe misliketh not this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation in his commentary vpon the 15. Psalme, where he interpreteth these wordes <hi>(Thou shalt not leaue my soule in hell)</hi> thus: Thou shalt not leaue my soule in the graue or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puscher: But how improbable an interpretation this is, ech man of common reason will discerne. For who euer heard, that soules were shut vp in sepulchers?</p>
               <p n="33">33. But <hi>M. Caluin</hi> after his fashion persisteth not long in in this, but nath another more solemne interpretation in <note place="margin">Caluins horrible opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the article of Christs descensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into hell. <hi>Cal.</hi> 2. <hi>inst. c.</hi> 16. 6. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12.</note> his second booke of <hi>Institutions,</hi> and in diuers other bookes of his, and the exposition is this, that Christ did suffer the very selfe same paines of hell it selfe, and all the torments of the damned, in his soule vpon the Crosse, as feare, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, distrust, horrour, and the like, by apprehending God his heauenly Father to be angry with him. And in this <hi>Caluin</hi> is so confident, that he feareth not to go further, and to blaspheme and say, that without this his corporall
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:368:77"/>
death had beene to no purpose: <hi>Nihil actum erat</hi> (saith he) <hi>si corporea tantùm morte desunctus fuisset Christus.</hi> Nothing had byn <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Item in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techismo paruo. ite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> psych. item in harmo. Euangelica cap.</hi> 27. <hi>Math.</hi>
                  </note> effected, if Christ had only dyed a corporall death. And so according to this interpretation of <hi>Caluin,</hi> Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily death on the Crosse did not deliuer vs, without these paynes of Christes soule: and yet, saith he, the soule went not downe locally to any place of punishment (for this doth he not only deride, saying there is no such place, but especially doth he hould it for a fable as presently we shall see:) but rather endured, as he affirmeth, and suffered the <note place="margin">2. <hi>Inst. cap.</hi> 16. §. 10.</note> paines of hell, and of the damned, as is before said. But the truth is, this is a blasphemous speach, and quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the whole mystery of our Redemption. For let vs search the Scriptures from the <hi>Alpha</hi> to the <hi>Omega,</hi> from the beginning of <hi>Genesis,</hi> or booke of Creation, to the end of that mysticall booke of <hi>S. Iohns</hi> Reuelation, and we shall not only find not any the like speach to this, but the cleane contrary in infinite places, all and euery where ascribing the whole mystery of our Redemption to Christ his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bloudshed, and bodily passion. And vnto this will euery indifferent Protestant easily subscribe and yeald.</p>
               <p n="34">34. And now touching his contemptuous censuring of all antiquity in the poynt of <hi>Limbus Patrum</hi> (which was the place where the soules of the ancient Fathers, and Patriarches remayned and were detayned, vntill Christs Resurrection:) <hi>Haec fabula de Limbo Patrum</hi> (saith he) <hi>ad quos</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Instit. c.</hi> 16. §. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>libera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dos Christum descendisse narrant; tametsi magnos habeat auctores, nihil tamen aliud quàm fabula est.</hi> This fable of <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> or prison of the Fathers, for whose deliuerance they recount Christ to haue descended, albeit it hath great authors, that make for it, yet is it nought els but a fable.</p>
               <p n="35">35. And who be these authors whom <hi>M. Caluin</hi> both accompteth great, &amp; yet reiecteth, but those principally, whom before we haue named, pillars of the Church in the primitiue ages? And did euer any man since the first foundation of Christian Religion speake so of all the light
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:368:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
learning, piety, deuotion, and Religion of all the whole Christian world togeather, this one wretched impostor excepted?</p>
               <p n="36">36. Thus then we see, that <hi>Caluin,</hi> though in words he admit this article of the Creed: yet he dissented from <note place="margin">A story of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of English Ministers about the descent of Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell.</note> all antiquity in the exposition thereof. Now as for the Church of England what they hould therein, it is hard to say, though many, and sore conflicts there hath beene amongst Ministers and Preachers of my quality for many yeares togeather, about the exposition of the article, <hi>He des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into hell.</hi> Only two memorable things I call to mind that passed there in my tyme in diuers partes of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and all about the exposition of that article, which heere I haue thought good, historically as it were, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlace. The first was in manner as followeth. It happened, that some dozen yeares since, I light by chance vpon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Exercise (for so the brethren call it) held by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne number of Ministers of the purer straine (as vsually these kind of Exercises are.) The towne (where this mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Ministers was) is called <hi>Maxfield,</hi> in the very vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost skirt, and confines of <hi>Cheshire,</hi> and the text then, and there treated vpon by the brethren, was the Psalmists Propheticall prediction <hi>of Christs descensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into hell,</hi> as it is me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. v. 8. &amp; repeated againe <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>Quonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> non</hi>

                  <hi>relinques animam meam in inferno:</hi> Because thou shalt not leaue my soule in hell. And the place is very pregnant, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the point. The bench being set, the Ministers ech in time, and order spake (but God knoweth how few wise and true words were spoken amongst them:) The first starts vp, and expounds it of Christ his suffering vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Crosse: a second vnderstands it of the Graue: a third extended it to Christ his sufferings of hell torments in soule: and the fourth yet added, and interpreted it of Christs being in the state of the dead. The Moderator (for such a one they haue in all their Exercises) he as wise as the rest insteed of mending all, he marreth all: for he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:368:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all, approueth all, and receiueth all, and then falleth out into a wonderfull admiration of the diuersity of the gifts of the spirit, that euery one of his fellow la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in the Ghospell, should haue his seuerall expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet all to agree, and all to be intended by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church. But this is iust according to <hi>Tertullian</hi> his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription: <hi>Nihil interest haereticis, licèt diuersa tractantibus, dum</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Tertul. de praescript.</note> 
                  <hi>ad vnius veritatis expugnationem conspirent:</hi> it importeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst hereticks, though so many men be of so many mindes, whilst they can conspire to impugne one truth. And do not so many seuerall, and erroneous expositions, banded against one true meaning of the article, forcibly make good this prescription, and note of <hi>Tertullian?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="37">37. And for my part, as then so now, I am of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute opinion, that if all my brethren, and their Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor with them had bene as farre out of the towne, as they were euery one of them from the truth of the text, and meaning of the holy Ghost, in that place, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer more haue returned, either to wiues or Cures, or made such an other fanaticall exposition, tending only to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of the Article.</p>

For first those of the Roman, &amp; truly Catholicke Religion do according to the expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ancient Fathers (which is a most certaine, and infallible rule of their fayth) vnderstand by this <hi>Catholicke Church,</hi> that visible Congregation of the first belieuing <note place="margin">The visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>licke Church.</note> Christians gathered togeather in <hi>Hierusalem</hi> at the time of our blessed Sauiour his Ascension, at which assembly the holy Apostles themselues (who made this article) were present, togeather with the Blessed Virgin Mother of God, and other holy men and women, vpon whome the holy Ghost descended, inlightened them, and infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them to preach the name of Christ, and further esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing, and confirming them in the truth, encouraging them to go forwardes manfully without feare of any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite humane power, and promising them, that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Christ, &amp; assistance of the same holy Ghost should be with them, and the directors of them, vnto the worlds end, to preserue this Church and holy Congregation in all necessities and extremities, so that the gates of hell, and damnable errour should neuer preuaile against it.</p>
               <p n="41">41.

her inwardly, directing her outwardly, and especially for the meanes of sanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conuaied vnto her through the conducts of her Sacraments, as chiefest and most holy instruments to that effect, conferring grace for our assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in the performing of all good works, wherof none can be partakers to saluation out of this Church.</p>
               <p n="43">43.

               <p n="44">44.

Rogers,</hi> as agreed vpon by our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:368:81"/>
Bishops, concerning the Church: about which he hath seauen seuerall propositions, first agreeing in some of them, somwhat with the Catholicks, and they haue learned it from the Catholicke Religion, and as their v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall practice is; and then making their owne choyce, to dissent, and disagree at their pleasure, as the inured cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of all Hereticks hath euer bene.</p>
               <p n="45">45. His first proposition then is this: <hi>There is a Church</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                  <hi>of Christ not only inuisible, but also visible,</hi> wherto supposing him to vnderstand of the true Catholicke Church, (for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he saith nothing) we do also agree, as their Bishops <note place="margin">Later pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of the Protestáts about the Church.</note> in like manner may be supposed to do: and yet can I speake this vpon my owne knowledg, that it is against the common knowne tenent &amp; practice of their Academicall Schooles: for there the question is amongst the most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Protestants, <hi>An Ecclesia sit inuisibilis,</hi> whether the true Church be inuisible; and yet is held affirmitiuely, to wit, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rogers ar.</hi> 19. <hi>pag.</hi> 86.</note> that it is inuisible, and not visible to manseies, for the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of the Church tendeth to flat Popery, which they cannot indure.</p>
               <p n="46">46. His second proposition is, <hi>That there is but one Church;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2.</note> which we affirme also, and they from vs haue learned so to speake: and yet I do not see how the Protestant, Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and other Sectaries, <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Sacramentaries</hi> can make one Church, they differing so fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tally amongst themselues, and in such weighty points of faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as they do.</p>
               <p n="47">47. His third assertion is; <hi>The visible Church is a Catholick Church:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3.</note> M. Rogers would haue said, or at least wise should haue said, <hi>that the Catholicke is a visible Church:</hi> and the reason is, for that all visible Churches, are not Catholicke, but all Catholick Churches are visible. And what was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this his incongruity of speach I do not see, vnlesse he meant thereby to steale the name of <hi>Catholicke</hi> vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery visible Congregation of Sectaries, which is clearly ouerthrowne by the definition, and large explication of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:368:81"/>
the word <hi>Catholicke,</hi> set downe in the first Chapter.</p>
               <p n="48">48. His fourth proposition is: <hi>The word of God was, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                  <hi>for tyme is before the Church:</hi> which being vnderstood of the Scripture, or written Word (for otherwise it is nothing to our purpose,) it contayneth in it a senseles, &amp; grosse absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, for therupon it would follow, that before <hi>Moyses</hi> tyme, the first writer of the Bible (which was more then two thousand yeares after the creation of man) God had no Church, because there was extant no written Word or Scripture, which were very ridiculous to affirme. But the only refuge that I can possibly perceaue that <hi>M. Rogers</hi> hath left him to make good his fourth assertion in proouing the word of God more ancient then the Church, is to fly to the vnwritten word: but this will not serue his turne neither, since we haue only in this place to do with the litterall, or written word of God, begu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne by <hi>Moyses</hi> the first pen man of the holy Ghost, and so successiuely vpon sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry occasions continued.</p>
               <p n="49">49. <hi>M. Rogers</hi> his first proposition is, <hi>That the markes,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. Markes of the Church.</note> 
                  <hi>and tokens of their visible Church, are the due, and true administration of the VVord, and Sacraments:</hi> but these markes are not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Catholickes, but worthily reiected, for that they are as hard, and obscure to find out, and as much controuerted as the thing it selfe whereof they should be markes: for that all partes, yea all sectes, and heresies doe pretend to haue due and true administration of the word, and Sacraments, and it is as hard a matter to determine this controuersy as the other, viz. to find out, which is the true Church. But the Markes of Antiquity, Vniuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Vnity, and Succession before mentioned, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by Catholickes (for such were <hi>Tertullians</hi> 1400. yeares ago, when he wrote that excellent booke of <hi>Prescriptions,</hi> and <hi>Vincentius Lyrinensis</hi> 1200. years since, to take away your late imputation, and denomination of Papist vnto Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes) are so cleare, and euident in themselues, that presently they will distinguish betwixt one Church and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:368:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
another, betwixt Roman Catholickes and all hereticall Sectaries. And albeit some Sectaries being pressed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, will pretend to haue these markes in their Church, and will set a good face vpon the matter, and challenge them also, yet are these wordes out before they be aware: for the matter being so euident against them, they present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giue ouer their clayme, they are content to hold ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of, running to other obscure markes (the common Plea of all condemned Heretickes) of the due and true administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Word and Sacraments, when God wotteth they haue neyther Word nor Sacrament, according to the Catholicke integrity and sincerity.</p>
               <p n="50">50. <hi>M. Rogers</hi> sixt proposition about the Church is: <hi>That the visible Church</hi> (to wit the true &amp; Catholick Church) <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                  <hi>may, and hath from time to time erred both in doctrine and conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> which assertion the Catholick in his sense doth hold for so blasphemous, and absurd, yea ridiculous also, as nothing can be more. For if this be true, that the true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Catholicke Church spread ouer the whole Christian world, can erre, and induce into errour, then is there no surety, or certainty in the world, no not in the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Christ, and his Apostles, who assured vs the contrary.</p>
               <p n="51">51. But let vs take a view of <hi>M. Rogers</hi> proofes out of Scripture for confirming this his sixth assertion, which <note place="margin">Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous proofs that the Church may erre</note> surely are so fantasticall and impertinent for any conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to be drawne from them, so absurd in reason, and ridiculous in religion, that no man of iudgement, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science can read them without indignation, and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as by the view will appeare. For thus he setteth them downe in his owne wordes, only I will add the inference vpon euery probation out of Scriptures. His first place is: <hi>Take heed, Matth.</hi> 24. 4. therefore the Church may erre. <hi>Belieue it not, Matth.</hi> 23. 26. therefore the Church may erre. <hi>Beware of the leauen of the Pharisyes, and of the leauen of Herod, Mar.</hi> 8. 15. therefore the Church may erre. <hi>Many shall be deceiued,</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:368:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>yea the very elect, were it possible, Matth.</hi> 24. 11. therefore the Church may erre. <hi>Shall he find faith vpon the earth, Luc.</hi> 18. 8. therefore the Church may erre. <hi>VVe know in part,</hi> 1, <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. therefore the Church may erre. <hi>Beware of Dogges,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church may erre, <hi>Beware of euill workes, beware of concision, Philip.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 2. therefore the Church may erre. <hi>God shall send them strong illusions, that they should belieue lyes.</hi> 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 9. 10. therefore the Church may erre. And is not this a sound proofe out of the Scriptures?</p>
               <p n="52">52. These are those cleare texts, that <hi>M. Rogers</hi> brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth forth to proue, that the vniuersall Christian visible Catholicke Church (for that only we now treat of) may be deceiued, and hath erred, determining matters of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: and yet as you see, here is not one word that is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or may be applyed to the said vniuersall Catholicke Church, but only caueats giuen to the Church, to beware of particuler deceauers, Heretickes, Pharisies, Herod, &amp; the like. And consequently these places are so idly vrged, and so absurdly applied by the Authour, that I should wast time in spending any more labour about perusing them any further. Only one of his places, I will but touch in one word. <hi>Many</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>shall be deceiued, yea the very elect, if it were possible:</hi> out of which place, for the ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing of <hi>M. Rogers</hi> proposition, and inferring the cleane contrary assertion, I reason thus, and let <hi>Tribunal Syllogis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi</hi> vmpire betwixt vs both, which is the better, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter consequence deduced out of this place: if it be impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the elect shall be deceiued, though many be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, then the Church comprehending the elect, as a part of her, cannot be beceiued: <hi>sed verum primum,</hi> for truth it selfe hath spoken it, (and this is the true meaning of those wordes, <hi>if it were possible &amp;c.) ergo &amp; secundum.</hi> The like consequence I would inferre out of all the rest, but the places are so absurdly, and against all common sense and reason vrged, that they are not longer to be stood vpon.</p>
               <p n="53">
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:368:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
53. The like miserable course, or rather more pitifull (if possibly it may be) doth he take to proue the second part of his proposition, which is, that the said Catholicke visible Church may erre in determining matters of life, and manners (for that is the question, and not his ydle word of erring in conuersation.) And first he doth alleag the words of Christ, <hi>Iniquity shalbe increased, and the loue of many shall wax could, Matth.</hi> 24. 12. therefore the Church may erre in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining matters of life, and manners. Secondly he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that of <hi>S. Paul, Restore &amp;c, least thou also be tempted, Gal.</hi> 6. 1. therefore the Church may erre in determining mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life, and manners. Thirdly, <hi>I do not the good thing which I would, but the euill which I would not, that doe I: if I doe that which I would not, it is no more I that do it, but the sinne that dwelleth in me, Rom.</hi> 7. 19. 20. therefore the Church may erre in determining matters of life, and manners. Fourthly, <hi>There is a fight euen in the best men, and me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of Christ, Rom.</hi> 7. 23, therfore the Church may erre in determining matters belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to lyfe, and manners: for this must be his conclusion out of euery one of these places, as his former of doctrine was out of the other. And are not these goodly argumentes to proue his assertion? His assertion (as you haue often heard) was, that the visible Catholicke Church might erre in determining matters belonging to manners, to wit in defining and finally determining, this is good, that is bad, this is lawfull, that vnlawfull, and the like; and he commeth in with his misapplied texts, to proue that particuler men may haue infirmities in them, and fight of their passions, or concupiscence. Doth he not hit the naile on the head thinke you?</p>
               <p n="54">54. But now lastly let vs come to his seauenth, and last exposition vpon this article of the Creed. <hi>The Church of Rome</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath most shamefully erred in life, Cerimonies, and matters of sayth,</hi> this he should haue proued, according <note place="margin">

Now then we see how out of this one article of the Apostles Creed (which all parts do admit) what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent doctrine there is drawne by different expositions: and I might shew the same in sundry other articles, as namely in that which ensueth immediatly after, <hi>Credo remissionem peccatorum:</hi> I beleeue the remission of sinnes: which article those of the Roman fayth do vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d accordingly as the ancient Fathers do, and this is not only of the remission of sinnes by our Sauiour his passion, and grace thereby merited to this effect, but also of the ordinary meanes left
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:368:84"/>
by our said Sauiour in the Church for ordinary remission of sinnes, and namely by faith and baptisme, for such as enter first into the Church, and the holy Sacrament of Pennance, which is (according as ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Fathers do call it) <hi>secu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da tabula post nausragium,</hi> the second table of the soule after baptismes ship wrack, for such as sin after baptisme, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sacraments: all which Sacraments, &amp; other meanes to this effect do worke their effects in the power, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the said passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Sauiour. So houldeth the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke. But the Protestant that commeth forth with a <hi>not imputation,</hi> saith, that this remission of sinnes consisteth only in this that they are not imputed, and consequently draweth a farre other sense vpon this article; so as I must perforce conclude with that which often hath bene said, and repeated, that it is not sufficient to admit these Creeds in words as the Ministers of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d are said to do in their Ordination, but the true sense, and meaning is especially to be stood vpon: which meaning being farre dissonant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vnderstanding of the knowne Catholicke Church (as lately we haue shewed) their orall and verball admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the said Creeds cannot be sufficient to make them Christian Catholicks, or deliuer them from the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being Hereticks: for that this very choice and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection which they do make of particuler senses, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of the Articles of these Creeds, opposite vnto our former rules, and Considerations before set downe at large, properly and effectually conuince them to be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks indeed.

Vpon what ground do they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit some Councells, and reiect others? Especially hauing excluded from Parlamentall suffrage all their Catholicke Bishops, and Clergy men, as it is euident they did (the thing remayning yet registred vpon Authenticall record, &amp; fresh in the memories of many now liuing) when at the first and second lay Parlaments, in the first yeare of the late Queene, they banished Catholick Religion out of the land.</p>

But supposing these foure Councels to be admitted, and receiued (if we consider how these Councels indeed are acknowledged by our Acts of Parlament, how reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced, and in what manner receaued for Catholicke, and Orthodoxe by our English Congregation at this day) we shall be fo farre from iustifying the Protestant Parlamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary admission of these Councels, or any other of their

For to set their wordes aside, whome we haue euer found contrary in their deedes, if the Church of England do sincerely imbrace, and receaue for Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, and Orthodoxe these foure first generall Councells which did resemble, comprehend, and present the whole Primitiue Church for more then foure hundred, and fifty yeares togeather after Christ, then must it follow, if they meane as they say, and that their wordes shall not proue wind, that the English Church, and our lay Parlaments must acknowledge and admit also that doctrine for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, and Orthodoxe, which without impeachment, controllement, or contradiction of any, can be substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally proued to haue bene taught, and held in this visible vniuersall Church, whereof these foure Councelles colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiuely represented the whole body for all that tyme. Which foresaid doctrine that both it, and euery point therof passed for so many ages vncontrolled, this one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may suffice to proue insteed of all; for that the said do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines should otherwise haue bene noted, espied out, reprehended, and censured by some of these Councells, els had they not done their duties, neither had they bene so vigilant for the good of the whole body: as they ought to haue bene; if hauing condemned some heresies (as they did) they had winked at others. Which once to imagine of an <hi>Ambrose,</hi> an <hi>Augustine,</hi> &amp; a <hi>Hierome</hi> for the latin Church,

a <hi>Basill,</hi> a <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and an <hi>Athanasius</hi> for the Greeke, nay to suppose it, and that confidently, though most impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all the great Saints, and learned Doctors in the world togeather, this cannot be no lesse then senselesse ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity, grosse stupidity, yea heathenish impiety, when as the least of these, which I haue named, was for learning able to haue resisted the whole Christian world, and for their zeale would haue spared none, in a point of errour or heresie: as I may instance and proue by <hi>Tertullian, Origen,</hi> and <hi>S.

And therefore to strike at the poynt I ayme at in the period of the Conclusion, doth the English Church, and Parlament admit all the doctrines that were taught in the Church, and that continued without the impeachment of any, notwithstanding all the zealous, &amp; vigilant Pastours in the Church? I thinke it will make great difficulty: and let it reiect them, or any of them, there needes no more to proue that Church to be hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call: let it admit them, it proues it selfe by departure from them, and their doctrines to be Apostaticall, for that it houldeth not the same points of faith, with these foure first Councells, which it maketh shew to receiue and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace. In a word, let it admit them, or reiect them, they shall neuer be able to wipe away the blot, and blemish, imputation, and innouation of damnable errour from their Church.

               <head>The first Consideration.</head>
               <p>MY first Consideration (which I promise, as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Why and how these foure first Councels were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and how therby it is conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that the church ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not err.</note> ground-worke, and foundation of all the rest) must of necessity be this, that the Parlament, and Church of England admitting these foure first generall Councells of <hi>Nyce, Constantinople, Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon</hi> for Orthodoxe, and truly Catholicke (as representing in their Bishops the complete, and entyre body of the Catholicke Church in their seuerall ages) must needes acknowledge in like manner, that for these first foure hundred and fifty yeares (or rather fiue hundred, for that it is not probable, nay possible, that within the compasse of fifty yeares, the same should now faile which had allready by vertue of Christ his promise continued foure hundred and fifty yeares) the <note place="margin">Vide Aug. de vnit.

And this was figured by the Parables of the net that caught both good and bad fish, and by the field that brought forth good corne, and weedes. And further, that this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible externall Church in those dayes was the very same, wherof Christs wordes were to be vnderstood, when he gaue this in charge to one vpon occasion, and supposal of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15 16. 17. 18. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15.</note> a complaint made against his brother, which if he succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not, then, <hi>Dic Ecclesiae,</hi> tell the Church: as also that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>S.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:368:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
how they might be truly sensed, and rightly vnderstood, what and how many Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts were left by Christ vnto his Church, which they were, what were their effects &amp; operations, how they were to be administred, and such other like. And if he were a Iew, or Gentill, that thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, questioning these doubts, and would vpon the resolution therof become a Christian, but being vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, would be instructed in all these cases, and the like he was to haue made his repayre, and recourse vnto this externall visible Church, and to haue stood in all points whatsoeuer, vnto her finall determination, decision, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, instruction, and perpetuall gouerment in all these first fiue ages, without malepart repugnancy, or obstinate reply, if he euer inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to be saued. And if vpon any ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity, or peruicacity any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were cast out of that Church in all that time eyther for interpreting Scriptures in his owne sense, according to a priuate spirit, or for peruerting or innouating <hi>de nouo, de suo,</hi> of his owne head or braine, in any the least poynt of faith, and mystery of Christian religion, as the Protestants do both, his damnation was by all held and concluded for certaine, except he repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and listened, yea and obeyed the voice of the Church his mother, that sought to reclaine him: for that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of this Church was euer held for God his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est tribunall vpon earth, and therfore irrefragable, since the tribunall of heauen standeth expecting what is here done by the Church vpon earth, being euer ready to loose, or bynd, to deliuer ouer vnto Sathan, or to release from the bandes of sinne, errour, and heresy, according vnto the former passed doome, and sentence of the Church, as among other Fathers, <hi>S.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:368:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the occasion of this first great Ecclesiasticall Assembly of all the world met togeather by their Bishops in this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell, was for the censuring and suppressing of two capitall, and damnable heresies, that then inuaded, and infested the Church of Christ. The first was the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy of the Arians, and this impugned, nay flatly deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the second Person, his identity of essence, to wit, the Sonne his equality of substance, and hodhead with the Father, granting him to be <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, of the same substance with the Father, which was the fayth and beliefe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church in those dayes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The second heresy, was the heresy of the <hi>Quartadeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> concerning the celebrating of Easter-day, of which heresy to speake any thing in particuler at this tyme I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not, since it is not to my present purpose; only I refer the reader vnto the author of the <hi>Three Conuersions of England,</hi> where this point is both substantially, and punctually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed. The mayne point wherof I am to treat in this place, is to intimate vnto the Reader, how both these he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies of the <hi>Arians,</hi> and the hereticall <hi>Quartadecimans</hi> were determined, censured, and anathematized by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this soueraigne and supreme Ecclesiasticall Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, I meane the first Generall Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> which consisted (as <hi>S.

And now to make vse in generall of that which hath bene spoken concerning the foure Councels by some particuler application, and illation: the inference must needes be this, that if the Church of England do indeed admit, and reuerence these foure first Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles (as it should seeme his Maiesty is of opinion it doth, and their Acts of Parlament confirme the same) then doth it follow by necessary, and ineuitable consequence (though

               <p n="11">11. Furthermore, for as much as our English Church in admitting these Councels, and that in the greatest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory of the Kingdome, the high Court of Parliament, doth therby acknowledge, and condescend vnto: that this externall visible Church, consisting of good, and bad is Christs true Church, indued with all the priuiledges aboue mentioned of Ecclesiasticall power, piety, purity, sanctity &amp; the rest; I would aske first, how this so visible a Church, so conspicuous for maiesty, so illustrious for san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, <note place="margin">An euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the whole Church cannot erre.</note> so adorned and beautified with all sorts of heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grace, and eclestiall verity, should or could afterwards grow to be inuisible, be spoiled of her dignity, bereaued of her authority, be robbed of her sanctity, and loose all her graces and verity? Or how of the spouse of Christ is it possible, that she should become the enemy of Christ? of the Church of God, the Sinagogue of Sathan? Protestants principles may imagine this, but this ouer throweth the very principles of all Christian Religion. For how can the later be preserued inuiolably, if the former be so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable? Or from whome can we sucke the pure milke of Christian Religion, or receaue the stronger food of the high mysteries of Diuinity, if it be not from the breasts of the Church? If it be not from the hand of our mothers learning, wisdome, and tradition? And now to follow this heathenish and irreligious principle of the Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts a little further: if the Church, I meane the former men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned visible Catholicke Church of these generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells;

if this I say haue thus fallen by false doctrine (as the Protestants imagine) then this Apostacy, and defection must eyther beginne first from all, or from one, or from a few only. To the parts then: if from all, how is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that so great a body, nay Christes owne body mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call (for so <hi>S.

               <p n="12">12. But if this defection vainely and ydlely supposed by the Protestants did beginne eyther from one, or arise from a few priuate men, contrary to the mayne current of the Churches doctrine, and tradition, which had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and lineally succeeded in the Centuries of the Church from Christs time to the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> then would no doubt the Prelates of the Church (which now were in possession of the Ecclesiasticall keyes, and practice of the power, and authority of the same, by cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring and condemning Archbishops, Abbots, &amp; Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as hath bene seene) haue resisted &amp; seuerally punished these supposed noueltyes and new fangles in religion. And truly albeit we should set aside the promise, and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our blessed Sauiour for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>seruing this his Church which he had bought with so great a pricc, as his owne pretious bloud, and brought vnto such eminent greatnes, at this very time of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> which was more then foure hundred yeares after his Ascension: yet in all humane reason (setting the light of religion apart) it cannot be so much as imagined, how such a body, Christ his body with such a vigilant Senate, and head ouer it, should by secret stealth, or little, and little, be infected, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, poysoned and consumed (as their phrase is) with Popery, heresy, superstition, or innouation, and all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

And yet if we will giue credit vnto the Protestants, and suffer their religion to set the least footing in the Church, we must against all sense, reason, faith, and religion imagin and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue all this, and much more, to wit, that such, and so po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent a body, so fortified with defences by our Sauiour, was so stolen away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it selfe, and from God also, as that it was lost, peruerted, corrupted, conquered by the gates of hell, made <hi>Babylon,</hi> the seat of Antichrist, and Citty of Sathan, before any man was aware of it: and are not these posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Protestants monstrous Paradoxes, strange <hi>Idea's</hi> &amp; <hi>Chymera's</hi> which no man of perfect sense can belieue?</p>
               <p n="13">13.

Let <hi>S. Augustine</hi> (one that was wont to be full of reuerence in some of the Protestantes mouthes) speake for all. <hi>Illa Ecclesia</hi> (saith he) <hi>quae fuit omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um gentium, iam non est? periji?

               <p n="14">14. Thus <hi>S.

15. And can any thing in the world be more like then this to our case? Doe not the Protestants, and the <hi>Donatists</hi> so conspire togeather that a man cannot distinguish them by their voice? The Protestants acknowledgeth the whole body of the Christian Catholicke Church, vnder these foure Councells, for the space almost of fiue hundred yeares togeather: neyther can he chose but confesse (since the poynt hath ben so often extorted from him) the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward lustre, Hierarchy, Gouerment, and Authority thereof. But if you aske him fiue hundred yeares after, then he will answer with the <hi>Donatist, suit, &amp; non est:</hi> it was the true Church, but it is not now, or at least wise not in that perfection of authority, as then it was. And if you demaund of him fiue hundred yeares after that againe about the time, that <hi>Luther</hi> sprang vp, he will not stick flatly to blaspheme with the same Donatist, <hi>Apostatauit, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rijt,</hi> it hath fallen into Apostacy, it hath perished: which speach you haue heard <hi>S.

So <hi>S. Augustine.</hi> And then further some few lines after, the same Father bringeth in the said visible Church of his age

               <p n="17">17. Now if this graue, and holy Father <hi>S.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:368:91"/>
into Apostacy, what shall we say of Protestants that do the same, and stand in the very same case?</p>
               <p n="18">18. But here it may be, perhaps, some man will reply, that <hi>S.

               <p n="19">19. To this I answere, that albeit <hi>S.

Which very poynt <hi>S. Augustine</hi> repeateth againe in his first booke <hi>de Symbolo,</hi> and the fifth Chapter, to shew his constant and vnuariable resolution in this matter of the Church.</p>
               <p n="20">20. And here I might alledge Father vpon Father, Greeke vpon Latin, and produce so many testimonies of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:368:92"/>
the ancient Worthies and ancient Fathers, as might suffice to fill a large volume, and all of them tending directly to <note place="margin">That the Church shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statate.</note> this effect, to wit, that the visible Church planted by our Sauiour (he being the foundation stone) and by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and spread ouer the face of the whole earth, shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer perish, or Apostatate from Christ, by any the least damnable errour, or heresy vnto the end of the world, &amp; Christ his second comming vnto iudgement. And to proue this they do all of them alleage and bring many pregnant and euident places of Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="21">21. As for example, these two heere vrged by <hi>S.

And now that <hi>S.

               <p n="22">22. And <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi> that ancient, and renowned Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, <note place="margin">De vnit. Eccles.</note> treating of this argument, soundeth forth this Eulogy
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:368:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in praise of the Church: <hi>Adulterari non potest sponsa Christi, incorruptaest, pudica est, domum vnam nouit, vnius cubiculi sanctitatem casto pudore custodit.</hi> The spouse of Christ cannot be adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, she is vnspotted, she is chast, she knoweth one house, she keepeth the sanctity of one chamber, one bed, and that with a chast shamefastnes, and loue. So <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi> in that excellent Tract of his <hi>devnitate Ecclesiae;</hi> which Tract alone, though it be but a very short one, yet is it sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be the bane of all heresies, and to keepe any man desirous of truth within the bosome of Catholicke vnity.</p>
               <p n="23">23. With <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> agreeth <hi>S. Hilary,</hi> writing to the <note place="margin">The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible strength of the Church.</note> same effect in expresse wordes, affirming: <hi>Hoc Ecclesiae pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prium est, vt tum vincat cùm laeditur, tum intelligatur, cùm argui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, tum obtmeat, cùm deseritur.</hi> This is peculiar vnto the Church, that when she is hurt, by persecutions, then she winneth, and ouercommeth, when she is reprehended by heretickes, then is she perceiued, that is to say, when she is misconceiued, she maketh her selfe in her doctrine to be better vnderstood, by declaration of matters called into question, when she is forsaken (eyther by rebellious chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that go out from her, or by Gods permission exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising her by tribulation) then doth she obteine the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and gloriously triumph. So as here you see, that they spake not only of the Church of their time, but of all other ensuing ages that it cannot perish or be corrupted. And with these agree <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> saying: <hi>Haec ergo nauis Ecclesia est, quae si quotidiè saeculum istud tamquam aliquod pelagus sortitur inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum, numquam eliditur ad saxum, numquam mergitur adprofundum.</hi> So speaketh <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> in his booke intituled <hi>de Salomone,</hi> the 4. chapter, that is to say. This ship therefore of the Apostles, that was tossed vpon the seas of this world as the true Church of Christ, which albeit it do dayly find, and feele the world to be troblesome vnto it, as a certaine tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and stormy sea, yet doth it neuer dash and split in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by striking against any rock, nor yet is it euer dryuen and drowned to the bottome. All which priuiledges could

not be verified of the said Church, if it were possible, that the spouse of Christ could become a harlot, or fall away from Christ, by intertayning any damnable errour, or heresy.</p>
               <p n="24">24. And as <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> so speaketh <hi>S. Hierome</hi> in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary vpon the fourth chapter of <hi>Isay:</hi> his wordes be these: <hi>Super petram sundatur Ecclesia, nulla tempestate concutitur, nullo turbine ventis<expan>

And the same holy Father in another place putting a reall distinction betwixt the Synogogue of the Iewes, &amp; the Christian Church, but especially betwixt the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of God made vnto both, assumeth the speach of Christ, and speaketh to the Iewes in the person of our Sauiour, <hi>Linquetur domus vestra deserta:</hi> your house, your Church, your Synagogue shalbe left desolate, and empty vnto you. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.</note> But as for the Christian Church (saith he) <hi>aeternam habebit possessionem,</hi> for that Christ promised vnto his disciples, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould I will be with you,</hi> or as other Readings haue it, <hi>I am with you to the consummation of the world.</hi> And the same speaches are reassumed, and reiterated by him in his Commentaries vpon the ninth of the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> and vpon the 28. of the Ghospell of <hi>S. Matthew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. And here I might tyre out both the reader, and my selfe also, with alleadging the vnamine consent of all the ancient Fathers, to proue, that the visible Catholicke Church of their dayes could neuer perish, Apostatate, or fall away from Christ to the end of the world, in regard of Christ his promise made vnto it, and yet the contrary hereticall tenent is a common receiued doctrine in the Protestants schooles in this last, &amp; worst age of the world.

               <head>The second Consideration.</head>
               <p>MY second Consideration concerning this present subiect of the foure first Generall Councells recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the Protestants lay Parlament, as is already premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <note place="margin">Why Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>testa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts do not, nor can reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy their di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uisions by any Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall or Nationall Councell.</note> shalbe this; that for as much as this Ecclesiastical deuise and inuention of calling generall Councels, and this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall authority in erecting this great consistory and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame tribunall of the Church, for the deciding, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining of all doubts, and controuersies that may possibly arise therein, eyther by the friendes, or rather ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes of the Church, must be presumed to haue come pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly, and proceeded originally from the holy Ghost: partly for that the first forme, origen, and practice therof was prescribed by the Apostles themselues, as you shal read <hi>Act.</hi> 15. according to that which we haue formerly noted,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:368:94"/>
and partly, and especially in regard of the infallible assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the said holy Ghost, that euer-blessed and neuer erring spirit of truth, testified by the words of high, and soueraigne commaunding authority, vsed by the Apostles in that first Councels decree: <hi>visum est Spiritu Sancto, &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis:</hi> it seemeth good to the holy Ghost, and vs: why (I say) this being so, haue the Protestants in our dayes (hauing now almost had a full age, since their defection from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Roman Religion) neuer as yet called a generall Councell amongst themselues, to repaire their owne brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, reconcile their owne emnities, determine and decide their owne controuersies, which (as before I haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) are both many and waighty, implacable, and irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliable? Truly it seemeth vnto me, that if they had beene of the same spirit, with the ancient Apostolicke Church, that gathered these foure first generall Councels, to hould all in one vnion and communion; nay if they had not bene led, or rather misled with a contrary spirit of schisme, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy and diuision, they would haue troden in the steeps of these ancient Fathers, and haue imitated them in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the soueraigne remedies of generall Councells for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the woundes of their owne home-bred diuisions, and damnable dissentions: at least wyse they would, without faile, in a whole age haue called some one, forasmuch as the ancient Church gathered, and assembled foure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compasse of one age, and an halfe: and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Princes; and people do bound, and border nearer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather, then did the Christians in former tymes; which were in a manner dispersed here and there, farre and neere ouer the whole face of the earth.</p>
               <p n="27">27. If reply be made, that then there was but one Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to affoard his Imperiall consent for the assembling of the Synod, &amp; now since the diuision of the Empyre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many Dukedomes, Princedomes, Kingdomes, and free States, there be many particuler Princes, whose wills, and iudgements can more hardly be agreed, whose assents are
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:368:94"/>
with greater difficulty to be required, and obtayned: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, this euasion is but a meere collusion, and therefore must not be suffered to passe without due reprehension. For since the forsaid diuision of the Christian world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to seuerall Kingdomes and states, many generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell haue bene called, and gathered amongst Catholickes, as before hath bene shewed, yea, and that in the middest of tumults, vproares, and garboyles in the temporall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states of the Christian world; and this a man of common sense, and reason may comprehend, &amp; imagin to haue byna greater let, and impediment vnto the gathering of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councells, then any incumbrance, and inconuenience that the Protestants surmise or pretend. But the truth is, heresy, and schisme originally grounded vpon proper e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, <note place="margin">Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts can abide parly and treaty nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Catholiks nor amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues.</note> priuate inuention, stubborne selfwill, and proud conceipted iudgment, togeather with obstinacy against the Churches authority: this, I say can neuer abide that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act discussion which a generall Councell doth require. For how can the Protestants thus deuided as they are, and knowing the weakenes of their owne cause, indure par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and treaty, eyther with the Catholicks, whome they accompt aduersaries, or among themselues with their owne Sectaries?</p>
               <p n="28">28. Not with Catholickes, as may be seene by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of ancient hereticks, conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned in these 4. first Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councells, to wit, the <hi>Arians</hi> in the first, the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi> in the second, the <hi>Nestorians</hi> in the third, and the <hi>Eutichians</hi> in the fourth, who fled what they could those Councells, appealing only to Scriptures, whereof there is one notable example amongst many others in the last of these foure Councells, I meane that of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> wherein the <hi>Archimandrite,</hi> and Archereticke <hi>Eutiches</hi> being sent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, with Notaries from this graue and learned Councell, to yield an accompt to the Councell of his hereticall opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, held of one onely nature in Christ after his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he first bethought him of this euasion, to say that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:368:95"/>
he would agree, and subscribe to the expositions of the Fathers that had sate in the <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell, and that of <hi>Ephesus:</hi> but this was but meere collusion, for thereby he only meant most craftily, and heretically to euade, and fly both the other two Councells of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that had already dealt against him, and condemned him, as also this of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> that was now gathered against him, to heare his cause, and to be his iudge.</p>
               <p n="29">29. But yet secondly, for feare that he might yield also to farre in this, he added presently an exposition, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Si verè aliquid contingat eos in aliquibus dictis, aut falli, aut</hi>

And is not this spoken like a Protestant?</p>
               <p n="30">30. Thirdly, when he had repeated, and vrged againe his blasphemous heresy of one only nature in Christ, in presence of those graue and reuerend Prelates, that were <note place="margin">The tergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nersation of the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiches ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:368:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Ephesine</hi> Councells) nor yet would he, for his part, admit, and imbrace it, if any such thing should happen to be read vnto him out of their writinges: and his reason was that, which is so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly vrged by Protestants, for that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Scriptures are better then the doctrines of all Fathers: the which though it be true in it self, yet was his meaning to deceiue therby, as you see, thinking by this faire glosle &amp; goodly pretence of Scripture to haue auoyded, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped the tribunall, and censure of the Catholicke Church in that time: but the Councell condemned his opinion, and person, notwithstanding his shifting euasions to the contrary.</p>

               <p n="32">32. And here also I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred that I had seene the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions required by the Protestants of <hi>Germany,</hi> when as they were inuited to come vnto the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> at
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:368:96"/>
the very first gathering thereof: and the said conditions were published in a seuerall booke which did beare this Inscription, <hi>Causae cur Electores Principes &amp;c.</hi> The causes why the Electors Princes, and other addicted to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <hi>word.</hi> But what this norme, or rule is, they expound not, but do leaue it, as they found it stil to be contended about. VVherunto if we adioyne two other conditions of theirs, which are the last, to wit, <hi>that the Protestant Ministers may giue voyces equally with Bishops,</hi> in deciding of all questions, &amp; that if they should not be able to defend their cause, yet not only their persons should be secure, but their cause al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so not to be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned for heresy: These I say, if we add as the later vnto the former, we shall plainely discerne that they had not so much as the least thought to stand vnto that Councell at all, but to their owne heads: and by these to their owne vnreasonable conditions, and vnconsciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to make their controuersies and heresies endlesse, and indeterminable. For if euery man, or at least euery Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister hath authority to determine out of Gods word, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will there be an end?</p>
               <p n="33">33. And here you see the small, or rather no hope that is of agreement betwixt Protestants, and Catholickes by way of Generall Councells, and that the Protestants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing themselues onely to Scripture, for the decision of matters, and not admitting generall Councells, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be vmpiring iudges of the sense, &amp; meaning ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they tread first into the steppes, and rake into the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious ashes of all former ancient condemned heretickes, euen for this very point condemned by the Church in
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:368:96"/>
many of her generall Councells: and secondly by such conditions they make themselues sure, and secure from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condemned in such sort, as that they will yeald ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And the selfe same fundamentall reason, or rather desperate refuge, and euasion of theirs, in prophaning and abusing this sacred Sanctuary of Scripture by their prophane spirits, and vnhallowed glosses, houldeth also for their neuer agreeing amongst themselues, by Meetings Conferences, Colloquies, Disputations, Synods or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells: for that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Sacramentaries,</hi> whether <hi>Zuinglians</hi> or <hi>Caluinists</hi> (for of these two only I meane to speake at this time) standing vpon this resolute principle on all handes, that nothing is to be determined but by Scripture, and then ech one interpreting that Scripture differently from the other, &amp; acknowledging no iudge on neither party, how is it possible, that they should euer come to any end of determination?</p>
               <p n="34">34.

For first <hi>Paphnutius</hi> only meant that Clergy men should not be barred from the company of their wiues which they had taken vnto them before they were of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:368:98"/>
but he doth not grant that they should take wiues af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were made Clergy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nay that, with the whole Councell he forbiddeth, and condemneth; but the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Church permitteth marrying also after they be Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy men. Thus you see, supposing this a true story of <hi>Paph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius,</hi> it rather maketh against them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then for them.

In which wordes though they be but few, yet sundry weighty things are signified, which make directly against the Protestants and Protestant Religion. As first that the Eucharist was reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in those dayes for the present vses of such as should haue need, when there was no Priest to say masse, and in such like necessities of the Church, Deacons that had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to administer the said Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to others, &amp; might do it lawfully, did presume also to do it vnto Priests, as when they were sick, and vpon such other like occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: and this they could not haue done, except the Eucharist were kept, and reserued: forasmuch as here it is expresly said, that they could not offer, or say Masse.</p>
               <p n="41">41. Secondly we may see here how much is ascribed vnto the Canon, and Ecclesiasticall custome; in so much
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:368:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as the whole Councell doth argue negatiuely thereof, for so much as neither Canon nor custome hath deliuered this vse of the Deacon, therfore it was an abuse: how much more would they haue argued affirmatiuely from the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Ecclesiasticall Canon, and custome, had there bene any to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="42">42. Thirdly the Eucharist is heere called <hi>Corpus Christi,</hi> the body of Christ: it is insinuated also, that it is a true, and reall sacrifice, in that it is said, that the Priest hath <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offerendi,</hi> power of offering the same, and the deacons haue not, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not stand with the Protestants opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a spirituall, and metaphoricall Sacrifice of thankes-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing only: for certainely this kind of Sacrifice' Deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s may offer as will as Priests, and consequently this Canon also seemeth nothing to agree with the doctrine of our English communion: as neither do many others, which to auoid prolixity I willingly ouer passe.</p>
               <p n="43">43. Out of the second Councell, to wit the first of <hi>Constantinople</hi> held vnder Pope <hi>Damasus</hi> in <hi>S. Hiercmes</hi> time, I saw many things most worthy of due obseruation: but those wordes of the seauenth Canon concerning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing repentant heretickes into the Church I reflected vpon with some diligence, as shewing the Churches man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding in those dayes. <hi>Arianos quide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> et Macedoni anos &amp;c. recipimus, dantes libellos, &amp; omne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haresim anathematizantes, quae non sentit, vt Sancta Dei Catholica, &amp; Apostolica Ecclesia, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q>We do receaue (saith the Canon) such as haue bene <hi>Arians, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians, Sabatians, Nouatians,</hi> and the like, when they offer &amp; giue vp vnto vs the supplications, accursing therein all heresies which doth not belieue as the holy Catholicke, and Apostolicall Church of God doth: and we receaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> signed, and annointed first with holy chrisme, both in their foreheads, their eyes, their noses, their mouthes and their eares, &amp; when we signe them we do say <hi>signaculum do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Spiritus sancti,</hi> this is the signe of the gift of the holy Ghost &amp;c. All these (I say) that desire to be admitted vnto
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:368:99"/>
the true fayth, we do receiue them, as <hi>Grecians &amp;c.</hi> And in the first day we make them Christians, the second day Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumenes, <note place="margin">A Canon of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And now whether this antiquity be more obserued, or better resembled by the Protestant, or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, I leaue the point to euery man to consider of; for intending breuity. I meane not to prosecute mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at large, but only to point at these two things by the way, that may shew conformity, or deformity betweene that ancient Church, and the Protestant, or Catholicke Roman Church at this day.</p>
               <p n="44">44. Out of the third Councell held at <hi>Ephesus</hi> in the yeare of our Lord God 42 8. sundry waighty pointes occurred, and represented themselues worthy of obseruation, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it all of them be ouer long here to be recited. And first I remembred the manner of proceeding, and condemning of <hi>Nestorius</hi> the Arch-hereticke, as it is most faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded <note place="margin">Vince<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius Lyrine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sis his relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus.</note> by <hi>Vincentius Lyrinensis</hi> in the very bginning of the second part of his <hi>Commonitorium</hi> the 42. chapter: and it is laid downe by him (who liued in the very time of the Councell, and for ought we know might be present ther at) in this manner. <q>This councell of <hi>Ephesus</hi> discussing and reasoning touching the establishing of some rule of faith, least any prophane nouelty, like to the <hi>Armenian</hi> treachery might creep into this Councell, all the Catholicke Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Priestes thither assembled (which were almost 200.) concluded, and agreed vpon this, as best, and most Catholick, to wit, that the opinions, and iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the holy Fathers should be brought forth before the Councel, such Fathers, as had bene either martyrs, or Consessors
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:368:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or at least constant Catholicke Priests, and according vnto their ioynt consent, and vnamine decree, the point then controuerted betwixt <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and <hi>S. Cyrill</hi> should be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and finally determined. This was the rule, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of faith first enacted: and according vnto this <hi>Nestorius</hi> as contrary to Catholicke verity was condemned for an Hereticke, and blessed <hi>S. Cyrill</hi> was iudged consonant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to antiquity.</q> So <hi>Vincentius.</hi> And now will the Church of England that maketh shew of receauing this Councell stand to this rule, and canon of faith, about the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of doctrine by the Fathers enacted, and put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice by this Councell against <hi>Nestorius?</hi> And will they sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all their iudgments vnto the assembly of Fathers, as this councell did?</p>
               <p n="45">45. My second obseruation out of this Councell was this, that when great stirres, and troubles were expected by the pious, and religious Emperours <hi>Theodosius</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinianus,</hi> by the reason of the great concurse of people of all sorts vnto that place, especially many fauourites of <hi>Nestorius</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinople,</hi> against whom this Councell was gathred, it seemed necessary vnto the said Emperours to send thither an Earle of their Court named <hi>Candidianus,</hi> who should represent their persons, for seeing peace, and good order kept: but yet with expresse protestation, that it belonged not vnto them, <note place="margin">

                  </note> nor any other secular man to haue any dealing in Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall causes in that Councell.

So those two Emperours: which conuinceth sufficiently that they hold not themselues for heades of the Church, nor iudges in Ecclesiasticall, matters but inferiour vnto Bishops in that behalfe. And will the Church of England admitting this Councell, admit this also?</p>
               <p n="46">46. But now as on the one side the religious Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours disclaymed from this Ecclesiasticall authority ouer the Councell: so I find that <hi>Celestinus</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> did acknowledge the same to appertaine vnto him: and it was by the whole Councell, without eyther opposition, or contradiction granted vnto him. For first he being not able to be present himselfe, he designed and deputed <hi>S.

53. Another poynt, that I cast my eyes, and bent my mind somewhat seriously vpon, was the 24.

And the subiect we haue how in hand, is touching the high esteeme, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and authority, to be giuen to the ancient Fathers, vnto which his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> doth appeale in this last place say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus: <hi>I do reuerence the ancient Fathers, as much, and more</hi>

               <hi>then the Iesuites do: and asmuch as themselues euer craued. For what euer the Fathers of the first foure hundred yeares, did with an vnanime consent agree vpon, to be belieued, as a necessary poynt of saluation, I eyther will belieue it also, or at least wilbe humbly silent, not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon me to condemne the same. But for euery priuate Father his opinion, it byndes not my conscience, more then</hi> Bellarmines, <hi>euery one of the Fathers vsually contradicting others.

               <hi>find them agree with the Scriptures: what I find agreeable thereunto, I will imbrace: what is otherwise, I will with their reuerence reiect.</hi> So the King. And that his Maiesty for his part, hath also a good meaning in this (as farre as his education, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction can possibly permitt) and further, that he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that he speaketh, and meaneth like a good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke, and orthodox Christian, I do with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and due respect of loyall duty vnto his Royall grace endeauour to perswade myselfe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And yet neuerthelesse, it is more then euident, and apparant, yea obuious vnto the eye of any discreet indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, iudicious, and vnderstanding man, that his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Grace hath bene notoriously abused, and very si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterly, an erroneously informed in sundry passages of this poynt, and mayne head, concerning the reuerence, respect, and authority due to the Fathers of Gods Church and that by such Statizing, and temporizing Ministers, that being no longer able to sustaine their weake, &amp; false cause, <hi>quaeipsissimo suo ruit pondere,</hi> would deriue the shame, <note place="margin">A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Ministers of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty.</note> blame, and burden of their now present tottering Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vpon the person of his Princely Maiesty, ingaging him thus, in their hereticall quarrell, and therefore they suggest from time to time such particulers out of euery generall, as serue rather for their owne sinister respects, then eyther for the preuention of errour, or decision of truth, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of the honour, and soueraigne reputation of his Princely Person: whence it commeth to passe, that they impressionate his Princely hart with their owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:368:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
humorous passions, exagitate his grace with their odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and malitious calumniations, bent against the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and the innocent: in a word, they rather auert his affection from ancient Catholicke verity, and peruert his iudgement, by their erroneous fancy, and late vpstart no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelty, then lay forth the playne, and simple truth vnto his Maiesty, (though they professe themselues to be Ministers of simple truth) eyther in sound substance, or sincere cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance. And this God willing we shall discouer by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particuler passages in this present busines and poynt of ancient Fathers, that we haue now in hand.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And first to proceed in order, and to beginne with the accusation, and imputation laid vpon the lesuits, for that they are here charged, according to that which hath bene suggested vnto his Maiesty (for I will neuer lay this imputation, and false accusatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon his Princely Person,) that they do not reuerence the authority of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers indeed, not so much, as his Maiesty doth, who saith here, as you haue heard, <hi>That when the Fathers of the first soure hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred years do with an vnanime consent agree vpon any thing to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued, as a necessary poynt of saluation, his Highnes will belieue it also, or at least wilbe humbly silent, and not condemne the same.</hi> But he that will peruse and read ouer the learned, and manifould laborious volumes of the Iesuites, shall find the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to go much further in this point, teaching, and constantly asseuering with <hi>Vincentius Lyrineusis,</hi> and with the ioynt agreement of antiquity, that the vnanime consent of Fathers vpon any point, maketh it an infallible truth. <hi>Quod Patres, &amp; Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctores</hi> (saith <hi>Gregorius de Valentia) vnanimi consensu circa religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. l.</hi> 8. <hi>Ana. c.</hi> 8.</note> 
               <hi>tradunt, infallibiliter verum est.</hi> VVhatsoeuer the Fathers, and Doctours deliuer with one consent about religion, that is infallibly true. And the same do hold all other Iesuites, which also <hi>Vincentius Lyrinensis</hi> (more then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares before them) doth confirme in these wordes, <hi>Hos ergo in Ecclesia Dei diuinitus per tempora, &amp; loca dispensatos, quisquis in sensu Catholici dogmatis vnum aliquid in Christo sentientes</hi>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:368:104"/>
               <hi>contempserit, non hominem contemnit, sed Deum.</hi> These therefore (he meaneth the ancient Fathers, and Doctors of the <note place="margin">Lib. con. hareses.</note> Church) giuen, and granted by God throughout all ages, and places, whosoeuer shall contemne them, agreeing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any one point in Christ, in the sense of Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, he contemneth not man, but God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And this is grounded, and proued (as the said <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia</hi> noteth) vpon that discourse of <hi>S. Paul, Ephes.</hi> 4. where he sheweth how Christ ascending into heauen, left his Church furnished, and fenced with all kynd of necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry furniture for her present instruction, future direction, and perpetuall prescruation, as with Apostles, Prophets, Euangelists, Pastors, Doctors, and this vnto the worldes end. And the reason of this is that, which the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Authour obserueth out of the Apostle himselfe, <hi>Vt non circumferamur omni vento Doctrinae,</hi> that we should not be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hither, and thither, and tossed vp and downe with eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry blast of Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And finally he confirmeth the same, by shewing that this great absurdity would otherwayes follow, that if the whole consent of Fathers may erre, then may they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the whole Church to erre, yea inforce her therunto, for that the Church is bound to follow, and belieue the vnamine consent of her Pastours, Doctors, Gouernours, and teachers, and that throughout all ages of the Church.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This is the doctrine, which I find amongst the Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, concerning the accompt, and reckoning, that is to be made of the vniforme, and vnamine consent of Fathers. For with <hi>Gregory de Valentia</hi> (as now I haue said) doe agree <note place="margin">The opi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nion of Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>suites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the authority of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> all the most eminent, and principall writers of that Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as for example <hi>Doctor Petru Canis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:368:105"/>
since there is no more yet promised, and professed, then eyther to belieue them, or to be humbly silent, and not condemne them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Further I find, that the Iesuits were neuer so strict with the Fathers, as to restraine their credit, and authority to the first foure, or fiue hundred yeares only, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to accept some, &amp; reiect others, and all at their proper pleasure, as the Protestants do; but that they thinke the same spirit of truth, and the same assistance of the holy Ghost descended also to the Fathers of the succeeding ages, and shall do vnto the end of the world.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Nor do I find them any where to affirme, that euery one of the Fathers do vsually contradict others; Nor yet were they euer of this erroneous, and dangerous opinion, that it is lawfull for ech particuler man to arrogate that liberty, and authority ouer the Fathers, as where he findeth them to agree with the Scripturs, there to belieue them, &amp; where otherwise in his opinion, there with their reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to reiect them: for that this would come to the same issue before mentioned, to wit, that euery mans priuate iudgment, should be his owne rule; and then would it consequently follow, that, <hi>quot homines, tot sententiae,</hi> wee should haue as many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersies touching the exposition of the Fathers, as we haue already about the interpretation of the Scriptures. And who seeth not, wherunto this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly tendeth, euen to leaue nothing sound, stable, and certaine in religion, which must be needes at last the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of all religion.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And now if it be lawfull for euery priuate spirit, and particuler man to iudge, when Fathers do alleage <note place="margin">A conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of great inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> by our English Ministers for patronizing of this point, and reducing of all, both Scriptures and Fathers, vnto the examine of a priuate spirit, I haue diligently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vsed the place, as it lieth in his second booke against <hi>Cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conius, Cap.</hi> 31. and 32. and vpon an exact suruey of the place, I find that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> giueth no such generall rule or warrant, for particuler men to iudge of the Fathers wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and citations of Scriptures vsed by them, but only in the case, and cause of <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi> that had held contrary vnto the whole Church, viz. that men comming from he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy were to be rebaptized; whose Epistles also were vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>Cresconius</hi> the Donatist against <hi>S. Augustine, tamquam firmamenta Canonicae veritatis,</hi> as grounds of Canonicall truth (to vse <hi>S. Augustine</hi> his words:) I say vpon these premises, the said Father answereth thus vnto the authority of <hi>S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> obiected, that in a manifest point of heresy (for so was the opinion, and yet <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> was no heretik, since he neuer defended it with obstinacy against the Church, but in all his opinions submitted himselfe to the iudgment of the Church:) <hi>Nos nullam Cypriano sacimus iniuriam, cùm eius quaslibet literas à Canonica diuinarum Scripturarum auctoritate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguimus.</hi> We do no iniury vnto <hi>Cyprian,</hi> when we do distinguish any of his Epistles from the Canonicall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of diuine Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="11">11. And afterwards againe hauing named the Epistles which <hi>Cresconius</hi> vrged, he proceeded thus: <hi>Ego huius Epistolae auctoritate non teneor &amp;c.</hi> I am not bound to admit the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Epistle; for that I do not hould the Epistles of <hi>Cyprian</hi> as Canonicall, but do consider them by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which are Canonicall &amp;c. Finally after a long praise <note place="margin">How S. Augustin did not ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mit the au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thority of S. Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer case.</note> of <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi> of his wit, eloquence, charity and martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <hi>S. Augustine</hi> concludeth, that notwithstanding all this, yet for that in this point, he dissented from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue of the doctors, and Pastors of the Church, he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to follow him: his wordes are these. <hi>Hoc quòd aliter sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puit non acipio, non accipio, inquam, quòd de baptizandis &amp; Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticis</hi>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:368:106"/>
               <hi>Beatus Cyprianus sensit, quòd hoc Ecclesia non accepit, pro quae Beatus Cyprianus sanguinem sudit.</hi> This that <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> held dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently from others <hi>(though not obstinately)</hi> I do not admit, I do not admit, I say, that which blessed <hi>Cyprian</hi> did hold about the rebaptizing of heretickes, and Schismatickes: and I do not admit it, for that the Church doth not admit it, for which Church blessed <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> did shed his bloud.</p>
            <p n="12">12. So then we see, that this which <hi>S. Augustine</hi> here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanceth, and speaketh of comparing, and trying <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> his Epistles by the Scriptures, is no generall case, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rule, nor warrant, that euery particler man may do the same, to the writers of euery particuler Doctor. For first <hi>S. Augustine</hi> himselfe that made this examine of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures was a great and learned Doctor, yea one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test that euer the Church of God had, and consequently was personally inuested with some more Ecclesiasticall authority then euery ordinary protestant Minister. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he perceaued right well that the opinion of <hi>S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> was much like the religion of the Protestants at this day, to wit, new, and dissonant from Scriptures, and different from the vniforme consent of Doctors, expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding those Scriptures, not receaued by the Catholicke Church: nay, and that which is aboue all, condemned by the Church. Thirdly <hi>S. Augustine</hi> did not presume vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his owne authority, to condemne <hi>S. Cyprians</hi> opinion, as dissonant from the Scriptures, for that in this case, the Authority of <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> might seeme to haue bene, as good as the authorty of <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> especially hauing sealed the Ghospell with his bloud, which the other, though a great Saint, had not done, nor was put vnto. But <hi>S. Augustine</hi> found <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dissenting from the true Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures exposition, as it was carried along by the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tradition of Catholicke Church: and so is <hi>S. Augustine</hi> to be vnderstood: for Scripture, and Church, euer go togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ancient Fathers, and they neuer vnderstand the one, without the other. All which circumstances are

                  <q>The Fathers did iudge of this cause at that time, when no man can say, that they did wrongfully fauour or disfauour any party.

We did not as yet plead with you before these Iudges, &amp; yet by them was our case decided, and determined: nor you, nor we were knowne vnto them, and yet do we out of their workes produce their sentences against you: VVe had as yet no strife with you, nor pleaded any cause, and yet haue we conquered you by their verdicts. </q>Hitherto are the wordes of <hi>S.

               <head>The second Consideration.</head>
               <p>AS my first consideration was wholy conuersant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the iust deserued credit of ancient Fathers, agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to geather in generall, eyther in the full voice of all, <note place="margin">How Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks &amp; Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts do esteem of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> or in the greatest part and consent of them: so was my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond imployed about the same credit, &amp; authority of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler Fathers, eyther one, or two, or more, auerring any thing, which was not reprehended by others in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion. About which poynt, I saw lesse ascribed in his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Booke vnto their promerited estimation, then Catholickes do hold in their Orthodox assertions, and much lesse, then I my selfe had purposely read, and obserued in the former mentioned holy Father <hi>S. Augustine</hi> concerning that poynt. For as his Maiesty yealded lesse to the common consent of Doctors (which must of necessity make the visible Catholicke Church, if euer Christ left behind him any Church at all to continew) when he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, <hi>that he would eyther belieue them, or at least wise would be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly silent, and not condemne them, as before hath bene shewed:</hi> So in this very second point of particuler Fathers, I find it thus written by his Maiesty.</p>
               <p n="26">26. <hi>But for euery priuate Fathers opinion</hi> (saith he) <hi>it bindeth not my conscience more then Bellarmines: euery one of the Fathers vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradicting of others</hi> The first part of which sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to wit, <hi>that euery priuate opinion of euery Father, bindeth not a mans conscience</hi> in matter of religion, is so cleare, that it needeth no proofe at all: for it cannot be denyed. For if the opinion be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed priuate, then is it not truly Catholicke, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently being not the opinion of the true Church, it bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no man.</p>
               <p n="27">27. But for the later period of the sentence, being who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly derogatory from the credit of Antiquity, that is to say,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:368:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that euery one of the Fathers do vsually contradict others in matters concerning religion, this must needes presub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to haue some fauorable interpretation affoarded it, to free it from open iniuring, and wronging of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and so my hope is, that this is the meaning of his Excellent Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, to wit, that these contradictions suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be a mongst the Fathers, are only diuersities of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in matters, that are not determinately <hi>de fide,</hi> or that do not concerne any articles of beliefe, but eyther such matters as <hi>S.

               <p n="29">29. But forasmuch as particuler Fathers do often times set downe, and deliuer the publike beliefe of the Church,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:368:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and not any priuate opinions, though they seeme to speak priuately, and not in name of the whole Church, when they mention this, or that point, concerning religion, some certaine rule, or note for our better direction, and <note place="margin">Thesurest rule how to iudge of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions or assertions about matters of faith.</note> distinction must be set downe: and the surest rule to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne how farre forth priuate Fathers opinions, ought to be esteemed, or may bind a man in conscience, is, for a man to consider vprightly in the impartiall iudgment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God, and his owne conscience, whether that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his if he be but one, or theirs, if they be many, haue bene withstood or gainesaid, contradicted or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned by any other Father, or Fathers, Synod, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, Prouinciall, Generall, or Nationall of the same, or other precedent, or subsequent ages. For if this cannot be made good against any one particuler Fathers opinion, then may it more then probably be inferred, that forso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as this particuler Father, was generally reputed for a Catholicke Doctor in his time, neuer reprehended, taxed, noted, condemned for this opinion, as false, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or erroneous: it must needes be (I say) necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred and concluded, that, that very opinion of his was the opinion, iudgment and doctrine also of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church in the age, and time wherein he liued, and of which he himselfe, was then a Father and Doctor. For if this were not so, it cannot be so much as with any probability imagined, that this Father could haue taught this opinion in his dayes, or diuulged it, in his writings vnto posterity without some note, or memory of control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or taxation of the same, eyther whilst he liued, or after his death.</p>
               <p n="30">30. And hereby it followeth, that albeit this Doctrine should haue but one, or two ancient Fathers, that do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly mention it in their dayes (other Fathers of the same tyme either not hauing occasion to speake therof, or els busied, and incumbred about other as weighty poynts:) yet were this alone sufficient to make vs vnderstand, that
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:368:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in their dayes, that mention the same, the forsaid opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that Father, or Fathers was held for Catholick Doctrine, &amp; throughout the vniuersall Church: for that otherwise without all doubt, it would the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or afterwardes haue bene <note place="margin">When any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did erre he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> descried &amp; censured by the carefull, &amp; vigilant watchmen of Gods Church. Neyther can any instance, as I imagine, be giuen to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary: for that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the very first infancy of Christianity vnto our dayes, it cannot be shewed, that any Father, or Doctor, though otherwise neuer so renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for wit, and learning, piety, or sanctity, did euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne any new doctrine, or erroneous opinion different from the Catholicke beliefe, but that presently the same was excepted against by others. And this is more then euident in the particuler cases, and slippes of <hi>Tertullian, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen, Cyprian, Lactamius,</hi> and other ancient Fathers of the Church: and yet when any of these transgressed the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t boundes, innouating any thing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the receyued faith, they were all of them excepted, and cryed out against, noted, &amp; taxed for such their priuate, &amp; erroneous opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from publick vnion, and Catholick Communion.</p>
               <p n="31">31. Neyther doth any man in my iudgment explaine this point better then <hi>S. Augustine</hi> himselfe and therefore, as I serued my selfe principally of him in the precede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, soe do I meane also in this. For as on the one side, when many Fathers do agree in their opinion against one, or few (as in the case of <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> about the rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of hereticks yt fell out) the greater part is there to be preferred before the lesse, as the said Father doth often af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme: so notwithstanding when no such opposition, and contradiction is of the <hi>maior</hi> part, <hi>S. Augustine</hi> himselfe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth high, and singular accompt of euery priuate Fathers opinion, as namely when he extolleth the authority <hi>O. S.</hi>

Thus <hi>S. Augustine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="34">34. And in these his wordes consisteth the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of this my Consideration about priuate Fathers, to wit, that <hi>S. Gregory Nazianze<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> syrnamed <hi>Theologus,</hi> the diuine, for his admirable, and profound knowledge in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test mysteries of Diuinity, though he had bene but one in that matter against <hi>Iulian</hi> (as he was not but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with many, as hath bene made cleare in the former Consideration:) yet so great was the authority of his person in the Church, as that neyther he would haue said as he did, but out of the common sense of the Church in his time, nor should he euer haue bene held for a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, nor venerable a Doctor, renowned throughout the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:368:112"/>
Christian world, but that the Church was sure, that he would affirme nothing, hould nothing, publish nothing, but out of the common rule, and infallible Canon of the most knowne truth: for that otherwise, he should euen to his face haue bene contradicted by other Doctors, and Fathers his equalls, and compeeres, that liued with him, or ensued after him. So as we see, that particuler Fathers sayings, and opinions when they are not gaynesaid by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or reprehended, or condemned by the Church, they are not so lightly to be respected, or reiected as Protestants doe both ordinarily teach, and practise. But the maine point to be waighed, and considered is this, to wit, to know in what times they were written, vpon what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, of what credit, or authority the Father is, whether other doe write the same, and accord with him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any exception haue bene taken against it, and then by whome, and when, and how it stood in the Church, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as iustifyed, or condemned, and many other such like materiall circumstances by me before touched: for that sometymes it may fall out, yea, and often times doth (as now we haue in part shewed, and might do much more at large) that particuler Fathers opinions, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions not contradicted nor yet on the other side agreed vpon in expresse tearmes by the <hi>maior</hi> part of Fathers in their writings (though otherwise belieued, and recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by them in the faith, and beliefe of the Church) may make a very strong argument, that the Church did then belieue it, especially if the same were so vnderstood also by the generall consent of the Fathers following in the subsequent age, and Church: and consequently it may bind euery man his conscience to giue more credit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, then Protestants incredulity will allow. And this shall suffice for my second Consideration.</p>

               <p n="36">36. There remayneth yet behind the chiefe, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall poynt of all others in this present busines and matter we haue now in hand to be handled, and to be especially considered of, which is this, to wit, to know whether the ancient Fathers of the first fiue hundred yeares after Christ (for so farre doth his Maiesties offer in the last edition of this his <hi>English Premonition</hi> extend it selfe) do make for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, or for vs: which poynt though to discusse at large throughout all the controuersies would both require, and fill a very large volume, and consequently farre surpasse the boundes of my intended breuity: yet shall Iendeauour in this last Consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to giue a sufficient glimpse of the truth therein, in very few words, for any indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:368:113"/>
that will stand attent, and iudge according vnto rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the more by the lesse.</p>
               <p n="37">37. For first in generall it may be here seene, by that which his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> layeth forth, that the Protestants do deale <hi>diffidenter,</hi> distrustfully on their owne behalfe with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers authority. For they do first limit their yeares with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compasse of foure hundred in the first English editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then of fiue hundred yeares in the next, and last of all they call it back againe vnto foure hundred in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin edition, which argueth that they know not well vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what ground, nor where, nor when they stay themselues, being still affraid, least that they grant to much vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as indeed whatsoeuer they grant vnto them it is to much on their behalfes, since that whatsoeuer they graunt, it maketh directly against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) which would not be, if their friendship with them, or hope in them, were confident, or any at all.</p>
               <p n="38">38. Secondly, they restraine their credit yet more, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they do not promise absolutely to belieue the consent of Fathers, but only they promise silence, and when they say they will belieue the Fathers of those first ages, when with one vnanyme conse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they shall agree vpon any thing to be belieued, as a necessary point of saluation: which seldome falleth out in matters, especially now in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersy, for that they being busied in other matters as before hath bene touched, eyther of writing Apologyes during the times of persecution, or in conuerting, and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the new conuerted Christians, or in confuting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hereticks, and heresies, it must needes be a rare case to find all the Fathers agree togeather with one consent (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were in a generall Councell) and to determine that this or that point was a matter of faith, &amp; article of belief.</p>

                     <hi>it is of necessity, that all Churches should come vnto her, that is to say, all faithfull people, from all parts of the world; for that in her hath bene conserued euer the tradition of the Apostles.</hi> Which plaine sentence the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> do endeauour to delude by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers shiftes. As first, that it seemeth to sauour of nouelty: then, that this sentence is found say they, in the copies that now are extant of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> as though there were other not extant, that had it not. Thirdly they do interpret <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his meaning, that he vnderstandeth onely by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, written Doctrine. But by this we may see, how they are incumbred with the writinges of Fathers, euen in this very first age after the Apostles, when these, and all other the like doctrines of Christian Catholick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were sealed with the fast shedding bloud of her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and Doctors.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. Another poynt also offendeth them much, which is the excellency and great merit of Martyrdome, which <note place="margin">8.

Ignatius,</hi> that constant Martyr, <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius in epistolis valde periculosè loquitur de martyrij merito. Ignatius</hi> in many of his epistles doth speake very dangerously of the merit of martyrdome. Also they do check the same Saint, and holy Martyr for that in his epistle vnto the Romans, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was going vnto martyrdome, &amp; to be deuoured of wild beastes in the Amphitheater of <hi>Rome</hi> he crieth out: <hi>Sinite me, vt bestiarum esca sim, per quam possim Christum promereri.</hi> Suffer me that I may be the food of beastes, and thereby promerit to enioy God himselfe. And what so great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill is there I pray you in this doctrine? For that through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Fpistle it appeareth, that he ascribed vnto
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:368:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Christ his grace all the fortitude which he expected for this combate, and consequently all his merit of enioying God proceeded principally from the said grace of his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. And so do the Catholicks at this day hould in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of merit, if malice, and enuy could suffer the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants to see it, and acknowledg it.</p>
                  <p n="52">52. But they are very angry with him for frequent v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of another phrase, in three distinct Epistles, to wit, <note place="margin">9.

In which words as you see, is not only expresse mention made of the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar merit of martyrdome, but also insinuated the intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of martyrs departed vnto the next life, for their friends left behind them vpon earth, as hauing not aspired vnto the heauenly blisse.</p>
                  <p n="53">53. And finally, not to go any further, they quarrell also with the said <hi>Ignatius,</hi> about the merit, and praise of <note place="margin">10.

And yet you see, we haue gone, but one age from thence, for the last was the first after the Apostles, and this is the second: and in the last you haue heard what chaffe they complayned of.

For that the said
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:368:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Fathers do hould nothing els, but that this iustice by them mentioned doth proceed from the grace of Christ, as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the principall originall concurrent &amp; concomitant cause therof, though yet not excluding the cooperation of mans will stirred vp and strengthned by that grace.</p>

And here I would intreat the ingenuous, and iudicious Reader to consider what kind of accusation this is, and the rather, for that they are not abashed, for the making good of this accusation to cite diuers places out of <hi>Tertullian, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, Cyprian,</hi> and others, that do plainely auerre the <hi>merit of good workes</hi> reprehended by them.

                  <p n="59">59. As for the Article of <hi>Pennance,</hi> they beginne with <note place="margin">14. About pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

doctrine of <hi>Penance.</hi> And the reason is, for that they make mention of satisfaction in doing of pennance. For proofe whereof they cyte diuers places out of <hi>Tertullian, Origen,</hi> and <hi>S. Cyprian.</hi> As for example: <hi>How much tyme</hi> (saith <hi>Origen ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil.</hi> 3. <hi>in lib.

And in the third booke of his Epistles, and 14. epistle he saith: <hi>Lapsos auxilio martyrum apud Dominum adiuuari posse. S. Cyprian</hi> is of opinion, that such as fall into sinne, may be holpen with God by the intercession of Martyrs. Heere then besides satisfaction is intercession of Martyrs.</p>
                  <p n="60">60. In the article of baptisme, they take vp, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend <hi>S.

Where <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> (say the <hi>Magdeburgians)</hi> dareth to auouch that he which baptizeth, conferreth the holy Ghost, and doth inwardly sanctify him that is baptized. A very great absurdity (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth) if you marke it, especially yf you conferre it with their Protestanticall opinion, that hould the Sacrament of Baptisme to wash only the externall man, and not the internall.</p>
                  <p n="61">61.

                  <p n="63">63.

                  <p n="64">64.

Tertullian</hi> erroneously seemeth to thinke that the keies were only giuen by Christ, vnto S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and that vpon him the Church was builded. And then they do cyte fiue seuerall places out of <hi>S. Cyprian:</hi> they might haue cyted many more, and all antiquity with him as concurring with <hi>Tertullian</hi> in this his opinion.

And the very same point of doctrine is often times by him reassumed, reiterated, and vrged, in inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men to imbrace the doctrine of Euangelicall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells, where he vseth the selfe same wordes in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of of his workes.

But I would thinke it more reason to exhort, yea, and to beseech the Reader, euen as he hath care of the euerlasting welfare, and saluation of his soule, to consider seriously, &amp; indifferently, setting all kynd of preiudice apart, whether it be not more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that so many learned, and holy Fathers, that liued with so great admiration of their vertue, learning, pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this age, should know what agreed with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Doctrine, and what agreed not, aswell, or (as a man would imagine) somewhat better, then these foure quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling Companions the <hi>Magdeburgians,</hi> I meane <hi>Illyricus, VVigandus, Iudex,</hi> and <hi>Faber,</hi> for these foure do onely sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe their dedicatory Epistle to Queene Elizabeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the yeare 1560.</p>

                     <hi>perceperunt.</hi> The nearer the holy Fathers were vnto Christ his incarnation, the more fully receaued, and perceaued they the mystery of our redemption. And yet these foure good fellowes do thus presume to censure the most reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, and learned ancient Fathers, as you see.</p>
                  <p n="74">74. And on this fashion these men go forwardes in setting downe all the 18. or 19. heades of doctrine before mentioned, as held by the Fathers of this fourth age, to wit <hi>Pennance, satisfaction, inuocation of Saints,</hi> citing aboue a dozen Fathers of this age for the same, of <hi>traditions,</hi> about <hi>Virginity, monasticall life,</hi> &amp; the like, wherein they do so check conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

out of the ashes of hell, and hellish heresy.</p>
                  <p n="77">77. And finally not to be tedious in going forwards with a copious enumeration of the foresaid articles, I do onely admonish the Reader, for the last article men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> how they do produce three Fathers more of this age that held the same, to wit, <hi>Lactantius, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentius,</hi> and <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> as they might haue done many more: and they add vnto the said former number diuers other articles, which the Fathers of this age do teach, as of the particuler rules of religious people now in vse, <hi>De me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morijs Martyrum,</hi> of celebrating the memories of Martyrs in Churches, and Altars erected and set vp in their honour: <hi>De signo Crucis,</hi> of the externall vse of the signe of the Crosse and miracles that thereby haue happened, whereof <hi>Pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, hymno ante somnum,</hi> writeth thus in commendation of the Crosse, and the benefit that redoundeth by vsing this laudable Christian cerimony: <hi>Crux pellit omne crimen &amp;c.</hi> the signe of the Crosse keepeth of all sinne from vs. And <hi>S.

                  <p n="78">78. Wherfore to conclude, we see that this fourth age agreeth with the former three in all points of doctrine held for Catholicke, throughout the whole Christian world at this day. And as the Fathers of this age doe consent with their predecessors, so shall we see them not dissent from their successours, as shall appeare by the next ensuing ages. And if this be not a sufficient demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the true Roman Catholick Church, and of her doctrine, confirmed by all records of antiquity, euen by the confession of our aduerfaries the <hi>Magdeburgians:</hi> then let the English Protestants answere vnto this euidence, and giue a better if they can. But we shall passe further yet to make an insight into two other ages that ensue.</p>

But this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like declamation was but a vaine ostentation of the challenger, and this large offer was also restrained, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked afterwardes by others, both at <hi>Paules</hi> Crosse, and in either of the Vniuersities: in so much that <hi>Doctor Humphrey,</hi> in <hi>Oxford</hi> in a funerall speach, made of the said <hi>M.

But heere in this our affaire, and busines we haue now in hand, we haue thought good to ioyne both these ages togeather, for that in them both the like descent of doctrine, one after the other is still to be found, the latter repeating, and confirming the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And for proofe of this point, I shall need to goe no further, then to the confession, and concession of our <note place="margin">

S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi>
                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:368:124"/>
doth euery where play the aduocate for free-will. From <hi>S. Chrysostome,</hi> they passe vnto <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> and from <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> to <hi>S. Cyril,</hi> and from them to <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, Hesichius, Thalassius, Faustus, Marcus Eremita,</hi> and <hi>Ioannes Cassianus,</hi> all Fathers and Doctors of this fifth age: and the same they do in the sixt age, alleadging many places out of <hi>S. Gregory</hi> the first, as also out of <hi>Euodius, Olympiodorus,</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p n="81">81. Then passe they vnto the article of <hi>Iustification,</hi> shewing that the Fathers of these ages did not ascribe Iustification vnto onely fayth, but required also workes, for which they alleage large sentences out of <hi>S. Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, S. Cyril, S. Augustine,</hi> though more contractedly, and out of <hi>S. Leo</hi> the Great, who offendeth them much by saying, <hi>recta fide &amp; bonis operibus peruenitur ad regnum Dei:</hi> by right fayth and good workes, we come to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. And from him they passe to <hi>S.

                  <p n="82">82.

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:368:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of men, which they declare largely, first out of <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> his writinges, saying that he was <hi>immodicus Encomia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes bonorum operum,</hi> an immoderate commender of good workes. And from him they passe vnto <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> shaking him also by the sleeue, and taking him vp for halting, and saying: <hi>Augustinus etiam nimiùm interdum operibus tribuit.</hi> Augustine also attributeth some tims too much to good workes. Then they passe vnto Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and shew the same excesse out of him. And from these they come vnto <hi>S.

                  <p n="84">84. And then in the sixt age, following the same methood, vnder their article <hi>de bonis operibus,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, for ascribing to much therunto, <hi>S. Gregory</hi> the great, <hi>Euodius, Cassiodorus, Olympiodorus, Fortunatus,</hi> and <hi>Iustus,</hi> Fathers of the Church, and doctors of those dayes.</p>
                  <p n="85">85. There followeth the article of <hi>Pennance</hi> wherewith they beginne thus: <hi>Consessioni, ieiuniijs, &amp; alijs ritibus ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miùm vendicat Chrysostomus.</hi> Chrysostome doth ascribe to much vnto Confession, fasting, and other rytes of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.

The same errour they ascribe to <hi>Maximus, Ioannes Cassianus, Eucherius,</hi> Doctors of this fifth age. And in the sixt Century they lay the same imputation vpon <hi>Cassiodorus,</hi> and <hi>S. Gregory,</hi> especially chiding him for that he saith, <hi>Poenitentiam age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, est perpetrata mala plangere, &amp; plangerda non perpetrare.</hi> This is to do pennance, to moane and bewaile our sinnes we haue committed, and not to commit againe thinges <note place="margin">

                     </note> worthy of bewayling. What can be spoken more diuinely by this heauenly Doctor? And would a man iudge these men to be Christians, daring thus to open their mouthes,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:368:125"/>
and publikely to blaspheme?</p>
                  <p n="86">86. I might passe further to alleage much more out of these <hi>Magdeburgian</hi> Centuriators, which they produce out of euery age, most manifestly against themselues, and their owne cause, with this onely fond confidence, that all authority, and credit of the venerable testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes of the ancient Fathers are shifted of, by saying only, that they are incommodious opinions, blots, stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and errours of the Fathers: as though the very glea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings <note place="margin">The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously handled by the Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgians</note> of the Fathers were not better then their whole vintage? and these blots and stubble, and falsely suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed errours, were not to be preferred before their best truth? But who tould these good fellowes that these were errours? VVhat Church euer held them so? What Generall Councell euer concluded them so? Nay what one Father, or one ancient writer (the grand here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes their ancient predecessours excepted) did once open his mouth, to speake against eyther all, or any one of these doctrines? If they can disproue any one of these doctrines, according to any one of the forenamed chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges, Church Councells, one Father, or many, we do faithfully promise to renounce them all as stubble, and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, as they speake. But if none of these thinges can be made good against any one, the least and weakest sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed doctrine, then must these doctrines as hitherto they haue stood in the Church for Orthodoxe: so must they hereafter continue Catholicke, and they themselues for confessing the Fathers to hould them, and we with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vrging antiquity, that do deny consent of Fathers in any point of doctrine generally receiued by the Church in their dayes, can be no lesse then great, and rash presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="87">87. And yet for full conclusion, I must aduertise the Reader, to note this one point, which in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is very remarkeable: for these <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> doe <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</note> scarcely alleadge one place of ten of these that are to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:368:125"/>
be found in the Fathers workes themselues, for proofe of the Roman Catholicke Religion, as euery man may easely discerne, if he please to read the Catholicke wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that make profession purposely to alleadge the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ancient Fathers, as namely <hi>Canisius</hi> in his large, Catechisme, <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine,</hi> throughout all his workes <hi>Cardinall Baronius, Coccius</hi> in his <hi>Thesaurus Catholicus,</hi> and others: but yet these that the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> please to cite, are sufficient to daunt the English Protestant his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the ancient Fathers, since that they alone of themselues confute, and confound both him, and his religion. With what face then can the English Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants vaunt, that the ancient Fathers are for him? And further, these few places of many that might be heaped togeather, may, as I hope, suffice to giue his Excellent Maiesty our Soueraigne, satisfaction, or at leastwise suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient light by these, to passe further, and to seeke more sound information of the true faith, and beliefe of the ancient Fathers of the first fiue hundred yeares, which his sayd Maiesty most Royally offereth to follow. For opening the window vnto which light, I haue thought it my bounden duty, both before God, and man, to take this small labour, and to lay these few heades of Considerations before the eyes of his Highnes most wise Iudgment, and vnderstanding.</p>

            <p n="2">2. First then the point of being a true Catholicke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto the name, and nature of the word, is of such importance, necessity, and consequence (as hath beene shewed in the first Chapter) that no riches in this world no wealth, no treasure, no state, no power, no policy, no human felicity may be compared with it, as right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>S. Augustine</hi> doth intimate. And for that your Maiesties eternall weale, after the briefe, and transitory passage of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:368:126"/>
this life dependeth therof, I cannot but most humbly, most hartily, and most dutifully, falling prostrate at your feet, beseech you to giue some serious attendance, and <note place="margin">Importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of being a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke.</note> attention to this high, and mayne point of euerlasting saluation, to seeke out what is truely <hi>Catholicke,</hi> both in the Church (for whose <hi>Epitheton</hi> the Name was first by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles inuented:) as also in particuler men, who is a true <hi>Catholicke,</hi> and who followeth the rule, which the Name describeth: to wit, he that in Christian Religion follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vniuersality, and not singularity, the whole, and not a part, ancienty, and nouelty, that which hath bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered and conserued from time to time, and not inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, framed, and set sorth in later times.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And for that on the other side heresy is the opposite, and contradictory vnto Catholicke Religion, for that it maketh choyce of a part to it selfe, and therby is held to be the highest sin in the sight of Almighty god that is, or can be committed vpon earth, for that it ouerthroweth the very foundation of fayth, vnder pretence to establish <note place="margin">The hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie.</note> and reforme fayth: My desire is so ardent in this point that your Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> should enter into due consideration ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as almighty God beareth wirnesse vnto my soule, and spirit, that nothing in this life sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth more neere my hart, considering the eternity of the next world, the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble weale, or woe therof, the <hi>vae,</hi> or <hi>euge</hi> that ech man is to receaue, as well Princes as others: and that these earthly Princedomes will seeme but shadowes at that day, and not worthy one houre of that glory, or misery, that is to be gotten or lost by Catholick Religion, or heresy in this life.

The second is about those foure wayes proposed by your Maiesty for auerring Catholicisme, and clearing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heresy, which are the admitting, and belieuing of all <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall Scriptures,</hi> the receauing of the <hi>three Creedes,</hi> the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the foure first <hi>Councells,</hi> and the acceptance of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:368:127"/>
               <hi>Fathers</hi> of the first foure, or fiue hundred yeares. In all which, if with the admitting in words, there be also a <note place="margin">The 4. heads pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>posed.</note> true Catholicke sense, no doubt, but they do make a man to be a Catholicke, and do condemne heresy. But the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of all standeth in the exposition, for to belieue the Scriptures in the sense that I thinke best my selfe, or to acknowledge them for Canonicall, or not Canonicall, as I, or some few with me of later times shall please to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, or to admit the three <hi>Creedes</hi> with that exposition of the articles, as I, and mine shall best allow; or the first foure <hi>Councells</hi> in some thinges, and not in other; or the first foure hundred yeares <hi>of Fathers,</hi> so farre forth as they in my censure do agree with Scriptures, is to reduce all to my owne iudgment: a thing most opposite to Catholicisme, and proper to heresy, as we haue at large declared.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Wherefore vpon my knees I do most humbly supplicate your Maiesty to consider well of this, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of the last poynt, concerning the ancient Fathers, which doth in effect co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine all the rest: for that these men deliuered vnto vs the Scriptures, togeather with the true vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding therof, according to the sense of the Church in their dayes: these men deliuered vnto vs the three Creedes, the first as from the Apostles, the other as from the Church, the third as from a priuate man, but yet approued by the Church: these men deliuered vnto vs the first foure generall Councells, wherein diuers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues sate as Iudges, and Bishops, and had voyees, and suffrages in the same: these men were they that exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the controuersies, determined the Catholicke do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, condemned heresies, an athematized hereticks, and cleared the coastes of all these wicked, and turbulent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances, which seditious, and headstrong spirits had raysed in the Christian world, by their contentions.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And finally these were they, whom our Sauiour Christ did vse as sannes to winnow his corne, &amp; to purge the flore of his Church, separating the chaffe from the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:368:127"/>
wheat, and eroneous doctrine from the truth, wherin they were so zealous, and diligent labourers, as not the least weed could spring vp in this field of the Church, but that these carefull good watchmen, and faithfull gardeners, did presently note, and pursue the same, vntill it was ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rooted out, or condemned by the Church, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as branches cut of from the body of the vine, suffered to wither away, and to consume of themselues. For proofe <note place="margin">The great profit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Fathers.</note> wherof, we may alleadge as many examples, as there haue bene different heresies, and hereticks in the Christian Church, for the space of fifteene hundred yeares, which albeit they ruffled much, &amp; mightily for the time, and had often great Princes, Kinges, Emperors, and Potentates to fauour, and patronize them (as the Protestants haue now your Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>:) yet are they so consumed in tyme, and by vertue of the holy Ghost, as the very names of many of them are now scarce remembred, and much lesse their arguments, reasons, proofes, and Scriptures which they brought for the same: and were it not that in these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bookes (who were their enemies) some mention is made therof, we should scarce know that there had bin such men in the world.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But on the contrary side, the Church that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned these men, and the Fathers, and Doctors liuing therin remayned euer both then, and after, victorious, and shal do to the worlds end: and still by succession, and continuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same Church hath come downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> age to age, &amp; one age giuing testimony to another of the purity of the said Church by razing out these euil humours from the body.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And now your Maiesty hauing seene by the former discourse how many points of ould condemned heresies haue bene reuiued, and renewed againe by the Protestants of our tyme: and that contrariwise almost twenty seueral positions about principall points of controuersy held by the said Protestants to be Papisticall, are asserted by the said ancient Fathers, as Catholicke in their dayes, euen
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:368:128"/>
from the first age after the Apostles, with repetition, and confirmation of the same in the subsequent ages, by the chiefe Doctors that liued therin: and that the said posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or assertions were neuer noted, or censured by the <note place="margin">The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lieuing the Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</note> Church for erroneous, hereticall, or scandalous: This I say, is, and ought to be your Maiesties prudence and loue of your euerlasting good, so waighty an argument, and motiue, as nothing more. For alas, dread Soueraigne, if the sentence of <hi>S. Paul</hi> be iust, and true, <hi>that an hereticall man is damned by his owne iudgement,</hi> and if that of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited be not false, that whosoeuer houldeth any one of those eighty three heresies, which he reciteth in his book to <hi>Quod-vult-Deus,</hi> or any other whatsoeuer which shall spring vp hereafter, cannot be a Christian Catholick, &amp; consequently must needes be an hereticke: Alas I say (my dread Soueraigne) and alas againe, in what eternall da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger doth your Princely soule consist, in that, by the euill cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the tyme, and temerarious course of such as you giue credit vnto, your Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> is drawne to hould, and defend, not only sundry of those positions, which <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> and before him <hi>S. Epiphamus,</hi> do recount for condemned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies by the Church in their dayes, but many other also: yea all the opposit propositions to the Catholick assertions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned out of the ancient Fathers, as namely, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Free-will, Iustification, good workes, inuocation of Saints, reall Presence, Primacy of the Church of Rome,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And truly to haue such a grand Inquest, or rather Parliament of Peeres to beare witnes against a soule, for conuincement of heresy at the day of Iudgement, as the rankes of these Fathers are in all the first, and purest ages of Christian religion, maketh my soule to tremble, euen in thinking of it. For if the cause were temporall, &amp; that there went therin but only the interest of your Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, and terrene Kingdome, yet were the case fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to see so many great lawyers and Iudges vpon the one side so resolute as the Fathers shew themselues to be. But
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:368:128"/>
now for so much as the matter concerneth an euerlasting and heauenly Kingdome, and sentence irreuocable in it selfe, neuer alterable, or to be changed, and of such infle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xible seuerity, as no respect, no regard, no difference of Prince, Potentate, or people is to be held, it maketh the Consideration more hideous and dreadfull.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And it may further be added to this Consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that in this publike triall about this point of Protestant Religion, your Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> is not only to haue this venerable ranke of forraine Fathers &amp; Doctors for aduersaries ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but so many domesticall also, as haue bene Catholicks within all your Realmes for these thousand yeares at least, I meane Bishops, Pastors, and Gouernours of those flocks, togeather with the flockes that were once subiects of your Ancestors: nay all your Maiesties Ancestours themselues, which are of most consideration, I meane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue two hundred Kings of both Crowns that haue gone before you, and togeather with the discent of their Noble Bloud left also in their inheritance of Catholicke Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as of their Kingdomes, to be defended by your Maiesty: which no doubt had bene most Nobly performed, if the <note place="margin">A strange pittifull case hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty.</note> strangest case, that euer perhaps fell out in the world had not happened to hinder it; and such a one as all posterity may, and will wonder at: and this is, that being viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depriued at once, as it were, in your cradle of both your Parents, who should, and would haue instilled to your tender eares, the most honorable inheritance of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick religion, the opposite and contrary fects were in place therof powred into your Maiesties Noble Brest, by such as had bene Authors or instruments of both their ruynes, and meant no doubt also to be of your Maiesty, if they should not find you plyable to their designes, for ouerturning of that Religion whereof they were enemies.</p>
            <p n="11">11. This then is the case, most dread Soueraigne, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious to the whole Christian world. And further that if your Maiestyes noble Grandmother Regent of Scotland
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:368:129"/>
had not bene vexed, and turmoyled with rebellions, tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and tumbled, wearied out and brought to despaire by the first Scottish, and English Ghospellers: if your Noble Father and Grandfather had not beene horribly murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if your renowned mother had not beene pursued, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, cast into prison, driuen out of her Realme, and finally made violently away <hi>in terra aliena:</hi> if all these things (I say) had not beene done, your Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> by all likelihood had neuer bene a Protestant. And shall we thinke, that of such Diabolicall premisses, there could ensue any good conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, or any godly, or wholesome effect of so abhominable causes.</p>
            <p n="12">12. I deny not but that the inscrutable wisdome, and prouidence of almighty God doth often times draw out <note place="margin">How God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>curreth with the actions of euill men, but not with their intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> of the counsailes and actions of euill men good effectes, as out of the wickednes of the Iewes, and Gentils, that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued, and murdered our Sauiour, he wrought the saluation of the world, but neuer doth he this according to the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailes, and purposes of the wicked: that is to say, these ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes are neuer intended by the wicked. As for example, that the redemption of mankind or saluation of the world was neuer intended by the Iewes, or Gentils that perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted our Sauiour, and procured his blessed passion.</p>
            <p n="13">13. But here in our case, the matter falleth out quite contrary, for that the chiefe, and prime intention of those wicked, whome I haue mentioned, was to effectuate this very point, that now we see brought to passe, to reuolue that crowne, expell Catholicke Religion, pull downe Monasteries and Churches, driue out, or destroy the <note place="margin">The mark aymed at by the first Ghospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in Scot<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie.</note> Princes that then gouerned, as also their issue, if they should leaue any, or els getting the same into their hands (the better therby to haue Title of gouerning in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants name) to preserue it so long, as it might stand com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for them, &amp; after to dispose therof as time should tell them to be best. But their chiefest ayme of all was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that, which out of an infants education they might
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:368:129"/>
probably hope for, and now haue arriued vnto: which is, that during the time of that education, they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps so inchaunt the mind of the young Prince, so change his iudgment, and affection, from the iudgment and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his said parents and other progenitors, as when he should come to the yeares of vnderstanding to discerne the merits of mens actions, and affections towards him, he should approue for good all that was done to his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est hurt, to wit, in matter of Religion, appertayning to his euerlasting saluation, to the ruine and destruction of his parents, to the reuolution of his Kingdome, &amp; the like. And shall we thinke, that God would euer concurre with such men, to such designements? God hath permitted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our sinnes, &amp; for the sinnes of thousands els, that haue perished, and are to perish therby: but any concourse of his to such mens intentions, no pious mind can yield vnto.</p>
            <p n="14">14. For if this should be granted, that God did concur with the actions of these seditious men, in drawing his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> infancy by so turbule<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; wicked meanes, from the vnion of that faith and religion, which all his parents and predecessours professed for so many ages togeather: then must it follow, that the same God neuer concurred with the other (I meane his noble Auncestours) by whom not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he did worke, and achieue, throughout all those ages, so many notorious workes of Christian piety, as perhaps by no Nation more. And to thinke, that all this notwithstanding, they liued out of his fauour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of true faith, infected with erroneous doctrine, deceiued with false Sacraments, were no members of his true Church, but rather cast out from his face, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered ouer to the delusion, scorne and power of Sathan, were no doubt temerarious impiety to imagine or affirme.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Wherefore most Noble, and renowned Prince, <note place="margin">The Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of all.</note> and Soueraigne, I do not onely, out of the dutifull zeale of a louing deuoted subiect, exhibite this humble Petition to your Maiesty, but also on the behalfe of our Sauiour
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:368:130"/>
               <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> intreat, that it may please your Highnes, if not to entertaine, and cherish, yet not to persecute that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, wherein your Ancestours haue liued so honourably and piously, for that this would be to persecute them in their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And your Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Princely nature, I know, <note place="margin">Of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution &amp; Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</note> cannot but abhorre the hatefull name of persecution, and violent proceeding, as well knowing out of your owne great Prudence, that nothing is more durable, or more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to hatred, and malediction in the world, especially the cause being so vniuersall and common to so many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Princes, and some of them the neerest of your Royall bloud, as all men see it is.</p>
            <p n="16">16. But the very fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall reason indeed is, that this Catholick Religion is no nouelty, or innouatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that whereunto your Maiesties realmes were first co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted from Paganisme, when they were made Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; wherunto they yielded their obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, promised subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, submitted the regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their soules, professed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stancy therin to the worldes end. And now then in any iustice can they be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for houlding that which was so solemnely sowne, rooted, and so generally admitted, so long, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contiued, so firmely grounded, so deliuered, and soe commended by our Fathers to this their posterity? If all our great Grandfathers, and ancient Predecessors were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue againe, might they not as lawfully be pursued, and persecuted for their religion, as we are now for the same? If they should looke vpon the Churches, which themselues builded, to the honour of Christ for diuine seruice, and especially for the vse of the publike Sacrifice, vsed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christendome at that day, and should see the same not only taken away, but penall Statutes also made against the fame, by imprisonment, vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, payme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of money and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tribulations, would they not complaine of great iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice done vnto them: in that so sharpe persecution should be laid vpon their children, for keeping their <hi>depositum,</hi> or pledg receiued, as the Apostle saith, and for obseruing
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:368:130"/>
their fidelity both to God, and them?</p>
            <p n="17">17. Wherefore most noble Prince, let this be as farre from your action or permission, as it is from your Royall Inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and disposition to be a persecutor of those that stand only in defence of their consciences: and these not framed vpon wilfull fancy, as all those of Sectaries and Innouators are, but necessarily laid vpon them by obliga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of religion, left vnto them by tradition of Gods whole Church, and by the Church of <hi>England</hi> in those dayes., as a principall member thereof, whose Communion in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if these men do breake, and leaue now, for what cause soeuer, eyther of feare, flattery, ambition, worldy fauours, and preferments, perills, or persecutions: then must they consequently breake of for euer that eternall band: and lincke of being saued togeather, or euer enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more the one the other in the next life: for that no association can be for eternity in the life to come, but by obseruing one, and the selfe same religion in this world. Which cogitation doth strongly worke with your Highnes Catholick subiects: and they do hartily pray our Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, that it may no lesse worke with your Maiesty in like manner.</p>
