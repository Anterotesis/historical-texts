            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Brief ANSWER TO Mr. L'Eſtrange HIS APPEAL.</head>
            <p>EVERY body that carries his eyes in his head, and hath but an ordinary reaſon and underſtanding, may ſee through this fine ſpun Appeal of Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange;</hi> it is plain enough, That having rendred himſelf obnoxious not only to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and parties of a Nation, but to the Government, and the Peace and quiet thereof, by his wicked and malicious Pen, he would, now, fearing to be called to Juſtice for the ſame, endeavour by this his laſt Appeal, to palliate his Crimes and hide his Knavery, with this Cloak of ſeeming Honeſty. But at the ſame time, for all his Juſtification in Words, he takes a wiſer courſe, in ſlipping out of the way to avoid Juſtice, and flies from thoſe very perſons to whom he Appeals, the King and the 3 Eſtates. As this very Act ſhews him not ſo very Innocent as he would make the World believe, or that he little confides in the Juſtice and Integrity of thoſe to whom he had Appealed, ſo it might ſufficiently ſerve for Anſwer of his Appeal to all the World. However, ſince the Gentleman has been ever very free of his Pen, and medling where it little became him, he may expect that ſome who have as little to do as himſelf, will alſo find time to return anſwer to his Scribling, and in a far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cauſe, endeavour to unblind the eyes of the people, which may be eaſily done, and in a very few words, in a caſe ſo plain and eaſie: For truly Mr. <hi>L'. E.</hi> uſes nothing but Sophiſtry, and tho' he believes he writes well himſelf, every body elſe is not of that Opinion, but conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Badneſs of his Cauſe, we may give him allowance. In this his Appeal, this Gentleman thinks, or at leaſt would have others believe, that he had Juſtify'd himſelf by ſhewing you ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proofs of his Loyalty and Innocency, brought out of his own Printed Writings, and that way hopes he has ſtop'd the mouths of all his gain-ſayers, and rendred himſelf Innocent and clear of all thoſe Accuſations laid againſt him; But ſhould we grant all thoſe proofs he has brought out of his Printed Pamphlets, to be true <hi>in Terminis,</hi> it is not for any of his good Deeds or good Words that he is accuſed, but for the many wicked and ſcurrilous, and indeed moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and pernicious Abuſes, he has put upon moſt part of the Nation, and truly on all that love not to ſee their Nation inſlaved, nor the Proteſtant Religion ſubverted: It is now plain enough of what Party and Faction he has been, and for what end he has made all this ſtir and pudder with his Writings; hoping to blind the eyes of the people, and under the colour of a Proteſtant, ſet Proteſtants together by the ears, to advance Popery.</p>
            <p>It ſhall not be my work at preſent, to make <hi>Roger</hi> ſight with <hi>L'Eſtrange,</hi> and to turn over all his impertinent Scribbles, to ſhew you how contradictory the whole ſcope of his writings are to thoſe ſhreds and parcels he has pick'd out to Juſtify himſelf withal. I have ſomething elſe to do, and it would ſwell this beyond the bulk of a Pamphlet, which I intend not; but let any one impartially read over his books, and they will finde enough, to oppoſe againſt what he hath wrote in his Appeal, in his own Juſtification, when the whole byaſs, and ſtream runs contrary: And all thoſe ſix particular charges, which he has obſerved in his 2d page of his Appeal, very ſufficiently made good againſt him from his own words; and would, had he ſtaid, have found Witneſſes <hi>Vivâ voce</hi> that would have ſaid more.</p>
            <p>But we will deſcend from Generals to Particulars, and briefly as may be, conſider the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of his Appeal, which he has caſt into 5 Heads, the <hi>1ſt.</hi> is the ſubject matter of his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45435:2"/>
as he calls e'm: The <hi>2d.</hi> to vindicate himſelf therefrom: The <hi>3d.</hi> the Rancour of the Libellers: The <hi>4th.</hi> to ſhew their Deſigns and Practiſes upon the Government; and laſtly, how much it concerns the State to protect him the aſſertor of their Laws, Rights and Priviledges.</p>
            <p>This man knowing for whom he had undertaken, believed he had a publick Cauſe in hand, and like another <hi>Coleman,</hi> priding himſelf in his parts, believes himſelf a States-man, and one already advanced to the Helm of Government, he has link'd the Security, Honour and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Government, with his particular quarrels, intreagues and wicked abuſes, and made his very Apology a publick Duty. Alas! that it ſhould ſo much concern the King and the 3 Eſtates, to take notice of this man, and of his Appeal, and that he ſhould vaniſh in a Miſt, that when they would graſp this honour and ſupport of the Cauſe, they can find nothing but Air! But notwithſtanding the Vanity and Oſtentation of this man, there is no body that can ſee the Honour, Juſtice and Security of the Nation, with what Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſoever his Caſe is complicated, to be at all concerned in any of his Pamphlets, and much leſs in his Appeal. This is but a taſte of the Vanity this ſelf-conceited States-man, and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chivillian</hi> Politician would have ſhewn us, if once the Wheel had come about, and his Lord of the Faction, come to be head of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But to our buſineſs, the matter of his Charge, which he has himſelf very well drawn up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 6 heads. 1. The ridiculing the Plot. 2. Countenancing the Sham-Plot. 3. Diſcrediting the Kings Witneſſes. 4. In abuſing the Nation under the Names of <hi>Cit</hi> and <hi>Bumpkin.</hi> 5. In miſrepreſenting the late Petitions and their Promoters as Scandalous and Seditious. 6. In em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyling the Kingdom by his Writings. This is the Charge that he finds is fixed on him, and which he very ſlenderly acquits himſelf of, by bringing ſome ſeeming proofs out of his own Writings to the contrary: But his Enemies, and ſuch as he has made to be juſtly ſo, have more to charge him with than this, though this be enough, and more than he can ever clearly wipe off: But as I am none of his Accuſers, I ſhall not ſay any more as to that point, how far he has rendred himſelf obnoxious to Juſtice, but only conſider a little, how far he has made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Innocent, and how cleverly he has wiped his mouth, and looks demurely and full of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, after he has rendred himſelf odious to a Nation, by his Calumnies and Abuſes.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, he brings you, as he calls them, the undeniable Evidences of his own Papers, which teſtifie his Opinion of the Plot; and here he would have you to believe, That he could not turn the Plot into ridicule, becauſe he believ'd it, a very fine way of arguing, Mr. <hi>L'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrange</hi> cannot be a diſhoneſt man, becauſe I know him. I would be loath to ſtretch this point too far againſt him, and rather think, for all his proofs, that he did not believe the Plot, and that he laughed at it, as many other fools do, becauſe they are blind, and led away by the Noſe by Jeſuitical cunning, and ſo think there is no ſuch thing. We know, that none knows better that there has been a Plot, and an horrid Plot and Conſpiracy againſt the Kings Life and Government, than the Jeſuits and ſeveral of the Papiſts, and yet who I pray is there that more laughs at a Plot than they? Who more hard to believe any ſuch thing? Who more ready to turn it into ridicule? to Lampoon it, and to write againſt it? Therefore this can be no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that you could not ridicule the Plot, becauſe you have own'd it; and indeed it hath been too manifeſtly made evident that this Plot was no fiction, and ſince you had undertaken its Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, you muſt of neceſſity own the matter of Fact; and you could do no leſs than juſtify your proceedings thereon. Yet in the very entrance of your Narrative you are ſo full of it, that you cannot forbear jeering at the Narratives of the Plot, which were ſet forth for the Satisfaction of the People. Yet there you ſay, <hi>Thoſe Authors ſhould hang a Table at their Doors,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Here you may have a very good Narrative for threepence, a groat or ſixpence a piece, or higher if you pleaſe, for we have 'em of all ſorts and ſizes: The only danger is of popping upon us Cat and Dogs fleſh for Veniſon, for take 'em one with another at the Common rate of Narratives, there's hardly one in five will paſs Muſter.</hi> Then by and by <hi>we have Narratives of things Viſible and Inviſible, Poſſible and Impoſſible, one of Fact, and another of Imagination;</hi> ſo, by and by, he plays again with the word PLOT. <hi>Plots of Interest, Plots of Paſſion, Plots to undermine Governments, Plots to ſupport them, Plots ſimple, and Counter-Plots, Plots Jeſuitical, Plots Phanatic. and ſuch like stuff.</hi> And then <hi>pag.</hi> 4. he plays upon Dr. <hi>Otes,</hi> and as one ſays, ſerenades him, but as he ſays himſelf, improving his Plot, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Superſtructure out of his own words, of a Schiſmatical Plot, and this <hi>pag.</hi> 21. he calls the <hi>tranſmigration of Conſpiracy.</hi> It would be too tedious to trace him in his own Steps through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, neither have I all his Pamphlets by me, as not thinking them worth the keeping, that I might quote the particular pages, for enough of his Ridicule might be gathered together, and in his <hi>Cit</hi> and <hi>Bumpkin,</hi> p. 11. his <hi>Cit</hi> ſays, <hi>If we were but once at the bottom of this Plot, which</hi> Bumpkin <hi>is a moſt hideous one, and wanted matter for another.</hi> Then he cunningly jibes at the belief of it, by ſhewing many ridiculous and impoſſible things impoſed on the people on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45435:2"/>
by <hi>Cit.</hi> And <hi>pag.</hi> 12. <hi>a fourth fancies two Plots.</hi> Now all this, and a great deal more in the ſenſe of a great many, ſeems a Laughing and Jeering at the Plot, and did leſſen the eſteem of it in many people that were too credulous of what Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> writes. But it is not enough to laugh at it, and to jeſt and jibe with it, but the drift of the latter part of his Narrative is to leſſen this Plot, by repreſenting to you the ſeveral falſe belief of it, concerning <hi>Powels</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trepann'd on Ship-board, and of the Arms found at Sir <hi>Henry Tuchburns,</hi> of <hi>Beding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields</hi> being dead, and yet alive; The Conſpiracy of the Apprentices; The Stories of the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers; and the miſcarriages of ſome forward Magiſtrates. To what did all this tend, in the underſtanding of any Judicious and Loyal perſon, but to the leſſening the Plot? or putting it wholly on the Presbyterians, whilſt a ſuſpicion is ſo fiercely raiſed of their dangerouſneſs to the State, and of their cunning and malicious Inventions, that the Plot might be forgot, or be leſſened in the eſteem of the People. And this Truth, a few Quotations of Mr. <hi>L'Eſtranges</hi> of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Plot, will never blot out, nor will all honeſt men be ſo blind, as not to ſee he hath ſufficiently, nay too too much (for one that pretends to ſo much Loyalty) laugh'd at the Plot, and turn'd it into ridicule.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, as to ſhamming the Plot, this is a new invented word, and asks explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but if I am not miſtaken, it ſignifies belying or diſcrediting the Plot, or making it a blind only to ſome other Plot in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Presbyterians, which he has been always ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to remind the World of, even as he ſays himſelf, <hi>p.</hi> 6. ever ſince 61, and here he quotes what he then ſaid, and I think has as good as ſaid nothing, for everybody that knows him is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced of his dear love to thoſe people; but ſtill to be harping on the ſame String, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially at this time, when it was ſo palpably known, as he himſelf confeſſes, that there was a moſt horrid and damnable Popiſh Plot, to murder the King, and to ſubvert the whole Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, when all parties of the Reformed Church were concerned, then I ſay, to reap up the old gleanings, and evil miſcarriages of the Rump of Presbyterians, concatinated with ſome few other Sectaries, and others of deſperate Principles and Fortunes, and at this time to put them upon the whole body of Diſſenters, who have hitherto ſhewed themſelves Loyal in all reſpects, and hate and abhor thoſe Principles he would fling upon them, and with ſo much earneſtneſs, with great labour and pains almoſt in every Pamphlet, repreſent theſe perſons doing and acting the ſame things over again, to ſtir up Jealouſies in the King, and to make them odious to the people, and this to be as he calls it, <hi>pag.</hi> 2. <hi>the Superfoetation of another Plot.</hi> Now let the World judge how far this Gentleman agrees with that moſt horrid Deſign of the Jeſuites and Papiſtical party, of framing a Sham-Plot, in which Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi> was ſo ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring an Agent, and putting it upon the Presbyterians, by which means they would have cut off the chief and moſt Loyal of the Nation, by telling the World, and endeavouring to make the World believe, that theſe perſons whom he calls diſſenters, are framing a Plot, and have a Plot in hand to ruine the King and the Biſhops, and to ſet up themſelves and a Common Wealth in their ſtead. If this be not ſhamming the Plot, as he calls it, I know not what is, for unleſs his Papers had been found in the very bottom of Mrs. <hi>Celliers</hi> Meal tub, they could not have been more like thoſe, ſo evenly are they yoak'd, and draw both one way, to make the King and Kingdom believe it was the Presbyterians, not the Papiſts, that were in hand of a deſperate Plot, and therefore he ſays, <hi>pag.</hi> 5. <hi>he is convinc'd there are ſeveral Sham-Plots Contriv'd and Started, where there is no colour or pretence at all, for a blind to the advancing of a Fanatical Deſign,</hi> and as he is convinc'd, ſo he endeavours to convince others, but what theſe Sham-Plots are, unleſs thoſe of his and the Jeſuits framing, we are yet Ignorant of.</p>
            <p>As to the third charge of endeavouring to diſcredit the Kings Witneſſes, Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> has again brought his own Quotations, every one of which, rather makes good the Charge, than any way excuſes it, for all the World cannot but ſee that thoſe Civilities as he calls 'em, and Complements to Dr. <hi>Otes,</hi> are down right Jeers and Scoffs, and have been ever taken ſo, by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that has read or heard them, and yet this Gentleman has the confidence to bring them as proofs of his Innocency and Civility to Dr. <hi>Otes,</hi> and would have all the World put out their eys, and not ſee the true force and meaning of thoſe words, but according to his falſe gloſſes. And for what reaſon is he an Enemie to Dr. <hi>Otes,</hi> but becauſe he is one of the Kings Witneſſes? and one of his Chief Witneſſes? and by diſcrediting his perſon, and making him ridiculous, or of ſmall eſteem with the people, that he may that way leſſen the eſteem of the Plot? <hi>pag.</hi> 7. <hi>They are wonderful things which the Doctor has done already, and am perſwaded he is yet reſerved for more wonderful things to come, when Truth ſhall deliver her ſelf from the Rubbiſh of Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Slander, and in deſpight of Envy and Impoſture, render his Name as famous to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as his Virtue has made it to the preſent Generation.</hi> And this he ſays he writes with little leſs than the <hi>Genius of a Prophet.</hi> This may be true, though not as he intended, and may be a Propheſie, tho' he to himſelf may be a falſe Prophet. But this though palpably a Jeer, he calls

a Panegyrick, and that you may take notice of his meaning, and as if there were Emphaſis, or ſomething more than ordinary in the words, <hi>Wonderful, things to come, Truth, Oppreſſion, Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Envy, Impoſture, Name, Poſterity</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> they are all put in a different Character, that you might obſerve the force of his moſt ingenious Complement, that like <hi>Janus</hi> looks two ways at once. The reſt of his Quotations are much after the ſame Nature, and how gladly he traces the Doctor, as he calls it, in making it plain that the Jeſuits and the Schiſmaticks in the late Rebellion, went hand in hand in Dethroning and Murthering our late Sovereign. <hi>Who was it but you that found out the Conſpiracy it ſelf? and then the Conſpirators,</hi> &amp;c? thus would he alſo fix it on Dr. <hi>Otes,</hi> to be an Author of Accuſing the Presbyterians to have a Plot in hand, becauſe he had ſaid that the Jeſuites formerly, in the ſhapes and diſguiſes of Presbyterians and other Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, were a great means of promoting and of fomenting the late Rebellion, therefore mark his Concluſions by Dr. <hi>Otes,</hi> his own Teſtimony, they are ſo ſtill; this is to do honour to the Dr. as he calls it, yea more than ever any did him, except the perſon that firſt called him the <hi>Saviour of the Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth Charge, that he abuſes the Nation under the Names of <hi>Cit</hi> and <hi>Bumpkin.</hi> And here Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> takes the pains to quote his own Characters of them, that they repreſent a couple of Raſcals, and not Lords, Citizens or Commons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I ſuppoſe the diſguſt was not ſo much at the Names of <hi>Cit</hi> and <hi>Bumpkin,</hi> as at the matter <hi>Cit</hi> and <hi>Bumpkin</hi> diſcours'd of, and how far that Book has diſguſted and offended the ſober and good people, hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy manifeſted by the ſeveral Anſwers has been wrote to it, though Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> will tell you that all was to no purpoſe. Yet all that read his Dialogues both firſt and ſecond part of them, will confeſs that he has not only been ſevere upon the Presbyterians, but has abuſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all that are not like himſelf, driving on a faction, though of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and no diſſenters, except from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church. He would perſwade the World that he wrote thoſe Dialogues of <hi>Cit</hi> and <hi>Bumpkin,</hi> in Anſwer to the virulent Appeal, which gave a direct en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to a Rebellion, but to help it forward, he takes a courſe to irritate the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, by making them worſe than the Papiſts, and favourers of the Appellants Principles. And after he has ſufficiently abuſed the Citizens, by his Raſcally and Fanatical <hi>Cit,</hi> he now in his Appeal ſeeks to cajole them. But what a buſineſs he makes, what words and diſtinctions he flies to, what Inferences he draws, and what a Grammarian he ſhews himſelf in 2 or 3 whole pages to ſalve his <hi>Cits</hi> Diſcourſe of the Parliament! and when all is done, the Cloud of Duſt he has raiſed, will not put out the peoples eyes from ſeeing his good intentions therein: Then he thought the ſitting of the Parliament a great way off, but now he would mince his Diſcourſe; then was then, and now is now, it ſpeaks too plain, his Conceptions of the Parliaments not being for his purpoſe. But there has been enough ſpoken of this already.</p>
            <p>As to the fifth particular, that he has ſcandalouſly repreſented the late Petitioners and the Promoters of them, he would evade alſo by his own ſelf Quotations. He grants Petitioning Lawful, if the thing be ſimply good Petitioned for. If ſo, ſurely the calling of a Parliament to eaſe the Burthens of the People, to rectifie errors in Government, and to bring offenders to Juſtice, is ſimply good in it ſelf, and therefore Lawful; and yet he tells you it belongs not to the multitude to interpoſe in matters of State, that is, in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for the People to Petition their Sovereign to call a Parliament, to eaſe their grievances, ſo that he grants, what in effect in the very next words he denyes. By no means, he will not hear of the peoples Petitioning, it is of dangerous Conſequence, and he tells in many particulars, in the late times. <hi>They began with Petitioning againſt Evil Counſellors and Grievances, then Petioned for the Militia, the Kings Towns and Forts, till they brought the King to the Block. And after this manner they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coeded now again,</hi> p. 18. what think you, is not this man an Abhorrer of Petitioning? and is not this a rendring the Petitioners, and Petitions alſo ſcandalous and odious? Then he tells us of ſeveral undue courſes and practiſes, uſed in former times, therefore he ſays, he has good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for apprehending the danger of Popular Petitions. Goodman, becauſe ſome have been choaked with eating <hi>Plumbs,</hi> none muſt ever eat them hereafter. If the abuſe of any thing muſt make the lawful uſe of any thing ſuſpected or avoided, we muſt forſake our meat and our drink, and our Garments. Men muſt by no means intermeddle with that they have no skill in; that is, Petitioning for a Parliament? what has the People to do with that? it is the Kings buſineſs and Prerogative; <hi>Why may not</hi> 20000 <hi>Plow-Jobbers as well Subſcribe a Petition to the Lord Mayor of</hi> London, <hi>for the calling of a Common Council?</hi> p. 17. a very good Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe it is out of the Sphear of theſe Plow Jobbers to Petition the Lord Mayor for what they have nothing to do with, therefore the People of <hi>England</hi> have no buſineſs to Petition the K<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng for the calling of a Parliament to eaſe their burthens and to rectifie their Grievances. But though it be the Kings undoubted Prerogative, to call and diſſolve Parliaments, we may now
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45435:3"/>
ſay, ſince the Votes of this Honourable Houſe now ſitting, has given us new boldneſs, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the aſſertions and Opinions of theſe Abhorrers, that it is the undoubted Right of the People of <hi>England,</hi> humbly to Petition their Sovereign, when Grieved, for the calling of a Parliament, and to redreſs their Grievances. But Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> doth not abuſe the late Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners by no means; have a care of that, he abuſes no body, though he gives them never ſo vile terms, and renders them odious and ridiculous. <hi>Cit</hi> ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 2. ſpeaking of Subſcriptions, <hi>There was hardly a Register about the Town that eſcaped us for Names,</hi> Bedlam, Bridewell, <hi>all the Pariſh Books, nay the very Goals and Hoſpitals, we had our Agents at all publick meetings, Courts, Church, Change, and all the Schools up and down, Maſters underwrit for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants, Women for their Husbands in the</hi> Weſt Indies, <hi>nay we prevail'd upon ſome Parſons to engage for their whole Congregation? we took in</hi> Jack Straw, Wat Tyler, <hi>and the whole Legend of</hi> Poor Robins <hi>Saints into our Liſt of Petitioners, and ſome Names ſerved us for</hi> 4 <hi>or</hi> 5 <hi>ſeveral places. And then</hi> Bumpkin <hi>replies; and you ſhall ſee how now that we were put to our ſhifts in the Country, as well as you in the City, I was employed, you muſt know to get Names at</hi> 4 <hi>ſhillings an hundred, and I had all my real ſubſcriptions written at ſuch a diſtance one from another, that I could eaſily clap in a name or two, betwixt them, and then I got as many School-boys as I could to underwrite after the ſame manner, and after this I fill'd up all thoſe ſpaces with Names, that I either remembred or invented my ſelf, or could get out of</hi> 2 <hi>or</hi> 3 <hi>Chriſtening Books. There are a World you know of</hi> Smiths, Browns, Clarks, Walkers, Woods, <hi>ſo that I furniſhed my Catalogue with a matter of</hi> 50 <hi>a piece of theſe Sir-Names, which I Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtned my ſelf. And beſides we had all the Non-Conformiſt Miniſters in the Country for us, and they brought in a power of Hands.</hi> Thus the Gentleman plays with the Petitions, and ſhews his abhorrency of Petitioning, ſeeking to deter the People from uſing their modeſt Rights in Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning their Sovereign. But now, if all, or moſt of theſe ſcurrilous things, which he has made <hi>Cit</hi> and <hi>Bumpkin</hi> ſay, be falſe; and falſly applyed to, and fixed upon the late Petitioners, is not this man Guilty of ſcandalouſly miſrepreſenting the late Petitioners, and the Promoters of the late Petitions? let all the World judge.</p>
            <p>To the laſt of his Charge he ſays, <hi>That he is extreamly out of his Meaſures, to be ſtill Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting miſunderſtandings in the very Act of endeavouring either to rectifie or prevent them. And to be indangering the Peace of the Kingdom, in the deſign of preſerving it.</hi> No doubt but Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> is the unhappy man, if thoſe were his meaſures, as to be utterly miſtaken in them, for I know not what could have created a greater miſunderſtanding, or more tended to the embroyling of the Nation: <hi>Not in aſſerting the Law and Government against all Oppoſers, as he would make you believe,</hi> but in ridiculing the Plot, abuſing the Kings Evidence, writing againſt Petitioning, railing againſt the Presbyterians, and raking in all the old Dunghills. <hi>Not by laying open the Malice of many bold Libells againſt his Majeſties Perſon, Authority and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> but by railing againſt every body that gives an Anſwer to his Scurrilous Pamphlets, and by abuſing all that he believes not of his way and Faction: <hi>not by maintaining the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Order and Conſtitution of the Church against Schiſm,</hi> but in rendring the whole body of Diſſenters odious, factious and ſeditious. <hi>Not by maintaining the Powers and Priviledges of the State, againſt all Principles of Sedition,</hi> but by making his <hi>Cits</hi> and <hi>Bumpkins</hi> to blow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Coals of Sedition. <hi>Not by inculcating Reverence and Obedience to Superiours,</hi> but by abuſing, ſcoffing at, and terrifying Inferiours. <hi>Not by recommending the Bleſſings and Duties of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> but by widening the breaches, and making greater the gap of Diſſention. Theſe are the things that have created ill blood, and have tended to the embroyling the Kingdom, but whether defignedly, or whether he miſtook his meaſures, I ſhall not ſay.</p>
            <p>The next thing he paſſes to, is to give you a ſcurrilous Deſcription of the Quality of his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers as he calls them; for all thoſe who write in Anſwer to his idle and abuſive Pamphlets, he calls ſo. And here he is Satyrical and abuſive, and the things touching particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I ſhall leave him; for whether the things he charges them with, be true or falſe, it ſhews his railing diſpoſition and foul mouth, nothing becoming the Gentility and breeding he would pretend to. But yet I cannot but take notice of his extream Pride and Vanity, in thinking and ranking himſelf as a State and Church Martyr, and his juſtly ſuffering for his abuſive Pen, he calls ſuffering with the King and with the Church, and for their ſakes alſo. The Jeſuites ſay as much, and it is a vanity inherent to ſuch Martyrs. But it now appears, that the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of the whole Kingdom, have no ſuch Opinion of the Service he has done, either to King or Church, but rather to the contrary, by his many abuſes put upon the people in his Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, has much diſſerted either. He ſays it is the part of the <hi>Devil himſelf to blacken and defame,</hi> and after he has thus ſaid Grace, falls to with open mouth, and blackens and defames all he can, with the ſpleen and rancour of a <hi>Cynick:</hi> eſpecially one little Creature as he calls
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45435:4"/>
him, which little Creature indeed has been a Goad in his ſide, and has prick'd the Bull ſo hard, as has made him bellow full loudly. But he is not only Splenetick at Mr. <hi>Care,</hi> for writing ſmartly againſt him, but has alſo put Mr. <hi>Curtis</hi> in ſeveral of his Pamphlets, among the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers, for exerciſing his Trade of Publiſhing Printed Books and Pamphlets. He is ſo very dogged a <hi>Cynic,</hi> that he will let no body live in Peace, that he thinks loves not him, or believes not well of his railing. The very acquaintance of any that writes againſt him, is enough to make him a Libeller, and there are ſeveral to my own knowledge that hardly ſpake of him, that he has abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed becauſe Friends or Relations to thoſe who have anſwered ſome of his Scurrilities. But he is no ways genteelly Satyrical, but a down right abuſer and ſcoffer, without Salt or Wit, and where he cannot charge 'em with any thing of Crime or diſhoneſty, rather than be wanting to his own Malice, he will ſeek for natural defects; which alſo if he cannot find, he will Create, and rather than want matter for his Buffoonery, will play with the Viſage of a man, and render it like a Viſard, an Ape or a Monky, or any thing that will render the perſon ridiculous. An old Jeſuitical trick, who upon the Reformation in <hi>England,</hi> and the eſtabliſhing of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, made the Common People of <hi>Spain</hi> believe that all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to M<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nſters, and were all metamorphiſed into ſtrange Creatures, with Aſſes heads, and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies tails, ſo that when our late Sovereign arrived there with all his Train, they were not a little amazed to find han<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſome men inſtead of Monſters, as the Jeſuites had ſworn them all to be. Juſt ſo does this Satyrical Wit play upon the Viſages and poſtures of ſeveral perſons, rendring them almoſt as diſguiſed as his own, but this is pitiful and mean. However they have ſince thought it good, <hi>par pari referre,</hi> and to Anſwer his <hi>Skeldri,</hi> as he had made others Owls and Monkies, ſo have they changed him into the Cur <hi>Towzer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for his particular malice to Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> that plainly appears to be the buſineſs of the party, who ſet him on, who thruſt this ſilly ſcratching Cats foot of his into the fire, to pull out the Nut, that is to abuſe him, and to render him ridiculous, and to endeavour to make him in little eſteem with the People, that his Evidence might be ſlighted, or elſe he, certainly would never have ſo publickly ſcofl'd at a perſon that has merited ſo much of all good men, and all Proteſtants in this Kingdom, in firſt diſcovering this moſt Horrid Popiſh Plot. Now to uſe his own words; Is not the World come to a fine paſs now, when ſuch a Fellow as this, ſhall hold the Ballance of Empires? That ſhall be the Pillar to ſupport the Crown and Miter? that ſhall charge the whole Body of Presbyterians with Fanaticiſm and Rebellion? That makes ſport with that Tool the Plot? as the Buffoon calls it: and to canton out all people that write againſt him, or the Plot to be Libellers, Fools, <hi>Egyptian</hi> Locuſts, and what not?</p>
            <p>But as to his Reaſons of his Libellers Rancour againſt him, firſt, he ſays, That they ſay he began with them; But that I ſuppoſe is not the true ground of the Quarrel, they endeavoured to take up the Cudgels againſt him, ſeeing him lay about him ſo furiouſly, that he might not ſight with his own ſhadow, and like an over-grown <hi>Coloſſus</hi> of Wit, terrifie an whole Nation, as if none durſt Cope with him. But the chief and true ground was indeed to undeceive the People, and to let them ſee this Papiſt in diſguiſe, and as he ſays himſelf for harping ſo unſeaſonably on that one String of 41, without any ground at all, and this he terms their Rancour. This he would evade by his old way if you will believe him (he'l make you think the Moon is made of green Cheeſe) for he tells you the weighty reaſons of all his frivolous, ſcurrilous and ſcandalous ſcribling, which were either to defend himſelf, or to unmask the fallacy of impoſing on the people: (that is, that you might believe him and no body elſe) or to lay open the Arts by which the City of <hi>London</hi> was formerly betrayed to Slavery and Faction (that is, to have moſt of them thought Raſcals) or for the undeceiving the credulous people, that had been miſled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily by the accurſed Libel called the <hi>Appeal,</hi> and therefore he wrote his <hi>Cit</hi> and <hi>Bumpkin,</hi> which groſly abuſes both City and Country; Glorious ends, and as well acquitted. As for Dr. <hi>Otes,</hi> he has but improved his Diſcoveries, and help'd his Evidence towards the rooting out all the Prieſts and Jeſuites out of the Land: that is, by deſtroying Presbytery, and all the diſguiſed <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts and Papiſts amongſt them, that the Proteſtants Maſqueders may throw off their V<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>zards, and appear bare fac'd.</p>
            <p>He ſtill proceeds to tell you his good intent and meaning, in putting forth his many Pamphlets, nay and the good they have effected, by making ſome Converts, and ſatisfying and confirming others, if you will believe him. It is very hard, that he ſhould do thoſe things by thoſe very means which has offended moſt of the Nation, eſpecially the more ſober and moderate ſort, and rendred himſelf of being ſuſpected no true Son of the Church, nor faithful Servant of the King, but all the while ſerving another Intereſt. He ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 24. <hi>he has lived long enough in the World to underſtand in ſome meaſure both Men and Books, and that popular paſſions are moved by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Diſcourſes, as the Waves of the Sea by the power of the Winds. It is the first Office of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:45435:4"/>
               <hi>Pamphlets in all caſe of deſign upon any eminent alteration of the State to poſſeſs the people with falſe Notions,</hi> &amp;c. Now may not we ſuppoſe that Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> well knowing theſe Maxims, has followed them (or at leaſt ſeems ſo in the eyes of many) and now, when ſo great a deſign of the alteration of the Government was in hand, which is the <hi>PLOT,</hi> has moſt fairly and opportunely taken the time of troubling and muddying the waters with the ſilth of 41, nothing but all the Miſcarriages of the Schiſmaticks and Sectaries muſt be now laid open afreſh, to beget diſguſts and murmurings and jealouſies of one part againſt another, and inſtead of clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up the breach, as a good man ought to have done, and of calling to Unity, he nothing but roars out 41, 41, in every paper, whilſt the Jeſuitical Deſign in the mean time is working the ruine of 3 Kingdoms, <hi>Divide &amp; Impera,</hi> ſet them together by the ears, and we ſhall do the work; but yet do it under the notion of ſerving the King and Kingdom by all means. The Gentleman is angry at the liberty of the Preſs, I cannot blame him, but 'tis hoped whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint ſhould be put thereon by Authority, that it ſhall never fall under Mr. <hi>L'Eſtranges</hi> hand to be a Licenſer, for then 'twill be very hard to get any thing Licenſed that ſhould be wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Papiſts, but ſhould be ſtifled, as he had ſerved ſeveral when he had power; Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt the Plot, he calls writing againſt the Government: and writing againſt him, he calls writing againſt Superiours and Magiſtrates: writing againſt Papiſts, is an undutiful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate practice againſt the publick peace, to the extream hazard and diſhonour of the State. And yet this is the Doctor who profeſſes in his Papers, Antidotes againſt all Peſtilent and Poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Infuſions, The State Quack, who purges the Nation of its errors. The <hi>Hocus Pocus</hi> that reſolves all its riddles and expounds their meaning. The zealot for the Church, and one who has Dedicated Soul, Body, Fortune, Intereſts to the Service of his Prince and Country.</p>
            <p>He next proceeds to diſcover the Deſigns and Practices on the publick Peace, by the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scandalous and dangerous Libels, a great many of which he quotes, and we agree with him, that ſuch pernicious Libellers do much miſchief in a State, but as they have always been, and ever will be as Vermine in a State, ſo they are liable to the Laws and anſwerable to them, let ſuch be puniſhed, but let not all that write againſt Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> be thruſt among theſe pack of Libellers; nor let it be in the power of Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> to be the only Judge of what is ſit to be Printed, and what not.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place he troubles himſelf to little purpoſe, how far in Honour and Juſtice a Prince or State ought to countenance and protect the Aſſertors of their Rights or Priviledges; we grant 'tis much to their Honour and great Juſtice to do it, but yet we will not ſay, Therefore Mr. <hi>L'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrange</hi> ought to be countenanced or rewarded, as ſuch an Aſſertor of the Rights or Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the King and Kingdom. I ſhall leave him with his Politicks, and draw to a Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is, That I have wrote this very brief Anſwer to Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange's</hi> plauſible Appeal, without any thing of rancour or malice, or particular Spleen againſt the man, but to ſhew the World that all is not Gold that gliſters, and that Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> is not the Loyal Perſon he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to, nor a State Martyr, but one that ſuffers, (in the Opinion of moſt,) juſtly for his own folly.</p>
