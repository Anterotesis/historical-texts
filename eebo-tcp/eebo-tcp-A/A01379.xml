            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The Lord hath many messengers, by whom he solicites man: He sends one health, to make him a strongman: another wealth, to make him a rich man: another sicknesse, to make him a weake man: another loss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But among them all, none dispatcheth the busines surer or sooner then affliction: if that faile of bringing a man home, nothing can doe it. He is stil impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate for an answere; yea, hee speakes, and strikes. Doe wee complaine of his incessant blowes? alas, hee doth but his office, he waites for our Repentance; let vs giue the messenger his errand, and hee will be gone. Let him take the proud man in hand, he will humble him: he can make the Drunkard sober; the Lascinious chast: the Angry patient; the Couetous cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable; fetch the Vnthrift Sonne backe againe to his Father,<note place="margin">Luke 15.17.</note> whom a full purse had put into an itch of trauelling: the only breaker of those wild Colts. <hi>Ier.</hi> 5. the waters of that Deluge, which (though they put men in feare of their

                     <hi>Iob</hi> was not ignorant of God before, while he sate in the Sun-shine of peace; but resting his head on the bosome of plenty, hee could lye at his ease, and contemplate the goodnesse of his Maker. But as when the Sunne shines forth in his most glorious brightnesse, we are then least able to looke vpon him: wee may solace our selues in his diffused rayes and comfortable light, but wee cannot fixe our eyes vpon that burning Carbuncle. These outward things do so engrosse vs, take vp our consideration, and drowne our contemplatiue facultie in our sense; that so long, wee onely obserue the effects of Gods goodnesse, rather then the goodnesse of God it selfe. Necessitie teacheth vs the worth of a friend; as <hi>Absynthium,</hi> wormewood rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vpon the eyes, makes them smart a little, but they see the clearer. Therefore <hi>Iob</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that in his prosperity hee had onely (as it were) heard of God; but now in his tryall hee had seene him.<note place="margin">Vers. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>I heard of thee by the hearing of the eare, but now mine eye seeth thee</hi>: that is, he had obtained a more cleare and perspicuous vision of him; the eye being more apprehensiue of the obiect then the eare. <hi>Segniiùs irritant animos di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missa per aures.</hi> When wee heare a man descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, our Imagination conceiues an Idea or forme of him but darkely: if wee see him, and in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16051:5"/>
tentiuely looke vpon him, there is an impression of him in our minds: wee know his stature, his gesture, his complection, his proportion. <hi>Sic o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culos, sic ille manus, sic or a ferebat.</hi> Such a more full and perfect apprehension of God did cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity work in this holy man; and from that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation proceedes this humiliation; <hi>Wherefore I abhorre my selfe, and repent in dust and ashes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where wee may consider three degrees of mortification; the Sicknesse, the Death, and the Buriall of Sinne. <hi>I abhorre my selfe,</hi> there sinne is sicke and wounded: <hi>I repent,</hi> there it is wounded and dead: <hi>In dust and ashes,</hi> there it is dead and buried. To <hi>denie</hi> ones selfe, maimes concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence, that it cannot thriue: to <hi>repent,</hi> kills it, that it cannot liue: <hi>in dust and ashes,</hi> buries it, that it cannot rise vp againe. I throw it into the Graue, I couer it with mould, I rake it vp <hi>in dust and ashes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I will not pull the Text in peeces; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I follow the manuduction of the words: for there is not a superfluous word in the verse, as the Psalmist said of the Army of <hi>Israel, There was not one feeble person among them.</hi> It beginnes as high as the glory of Heauen, and ends as low as the basest of Earth. The first word [<hi>Therefore</hi>] respects an infinite God: the last words [<hi>Dust and ashes</hi>] declare an humbled man. The meditation of the former is the cause of the latter, and the condition of the latter is the way to the former. To study God, is the way to make an humble man: and an humble
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16051:5"/>
man is in the way to come vnto God. Such a consideration will cast vs down to <hi>dust and ashes:</hi> such a prostration will lift vs vp to glory and blessednesse. Here then is a <hi>Iacobs Ladder,</hi> but of foure rounds. Diuinitie is the Highest, <hi>I haue se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To whom she answered, that for his other sinnes she had obtained pardon, but his rash imposition of hands, was a case which her Sonne would reserue to hims<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16051:27"/>
were fit in the choise, may prooue vnworthy in the progresse; therefore must be visited, to <hi>see how they doe.</hi> For if the Physician be sicke, what shall become of his patients? Certainly, a Ministers life is full of honour heere and hereafter too, so it is full of danger heere and heereafter too. O what an honour is it to labour in Gods har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest, to bee an Ambassador from Christ, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and retaine sinnes, to dresse and leade the Bride, to sit on thrones, and iudge the nations? Againe, what a danger is it to answere for soules lost by our silence, to bee guilty of blood, by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teaching, or liuing amisse? For howsoeuer the doctrine it selfe bee the Light, yet the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers life is the Lanthorne that carries it, and keepes it from blowing out: and it is an easier defect to want Latine or learning, then to want honestie and discretion. God hath giuen vs the <hi>Keyes</hi>; but if they rust vpon our hands, whether through foule carriage, or want of vse, they will but serue to lock our selues out of doores. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must submit to a Visitation.</p>

                        <hi>How they doe.</hi> What must it be examined, what store of soules they haue conuerted? No, it is the measure, not the successe, that God looks to.

                     <p>Gods visitation cannot be eluded or auoyded; there will be no appealing to a higher Court, no reuoking by Prohibitions, no hiding from the censure, no corrupting the Iudge, no answering the matter by Proxie, no commuting the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; no preuenting, but either by liuing innocent, or dying penitent.</p>
                     <p>Therefore let vs all visite our selues, that wee may saue God the labour. This is a dutie to which wee are all naturally backward: like Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, that chuse troubled waters, and refuse to drinke in cleare springs, for feare of seeing their owne deformities. Or vnthrifts, that are run so farre in arrerages, they are loth to heare of a rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning. Or, it may bee, we haue chiding consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and then, like those that are troubled with curst and scolding wiues at home, loue to be ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling abroad. But it is better to haue our wounds searched while they are greene, then to haue our limbes cut off for being festered. Descend wee then, into the depth and corners of our owne hearts; let vs begin our visitation there; mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all our rebellious lusts, and subduing our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the will of our Maker. So onely shall wee passe cleare and vncondemned by the <hi>great Bishop of our Soules, Iesus Christ.</hi>

The businesse of my Text is an <hi>Election</hi> too; an election into the highest office in the Church, to be an <hi>Apostle</hi> and <hi>Witnesse</hi> of Iesus Christ. If you please to spare the paterne in foure circumstances; as, 1. This office is spiritual, yours temporall. 2. This place was voyd by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie or decession, yours is supplied by succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. 3. This election is by Lots, yours is by Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages. 4. This choice was but one of two, it may be your number exceeds: the rest will sute well enough, and the same God that was in the one, be also present in the other, by the assistance of his holy spirit.</p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:16051:31"/>
                  <p>The argument of the Text is a prayer to God for his direction in their choice: yea indeed, that hee would chuse a man for them: including a strong reason of such a request, because he doth <hi>know the hearts of all men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They begin with <hi>prayer</hi>; this was the vsuall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the Church of God. So <hi>Moses</hi> prayed for the choice of his Successor.<note place="margin">Num. 27.16.</note> 
                     <hi>Let the Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh set a man ouer the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Christ sent not his Apostles to that holy work,<note place="margin">Iohn 17.27.</note> without a prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <note place="margin">Actes 6.6.</note> In the chusing of those seuen Deacons, they first prayed, and then <hi>laid their hands vpon them.</hi> Thus were Kings Inaugurated, with <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> and <hi>Prayer.</hi> It is not fit, he that is chosen for God, should bee chosen without God. But for this, <hi>Samuel</hi> himselfe may be mistaken, and chuse seuen wrong, before hee hit vpon the right. In this; I cannot but commend your religious care; that businesses of so great a consequence be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes sanctified with a blessing. Those which in a due proportion, must represent God to the world, ought to be consecrated to that Maiestie which they resemble, by publike deuotions. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery important action requires <hi>Prayer,</hi> much more that which concernes a whole citie. When <hi>Samuel</hi> came to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to annoynt <hi>Dauid,</hi> he calls the whole Citie to the Sacrifice. Indeed the Family of <hi>Iesse</hi> was sanctified in a more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner: this businesse was most theirs, and all Israels in them. The feare of God should take full possession of all our hearts, that are this day

assembled: but those with whom God hath more to doe then with the rest, should bee more holy then the rest.</p>
                  <p>The choice of your Wardens and Masters in your seuerall Companies hath a solemne forme; and it is the honour of your greatest Feasts, that the first dish is a Sermon.

The Braine that must dispell the fumes, ascending from a corrupt liuer, stomach, or spleene, had need bee of a strong constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>It pleased God Almighty, to make a fearefull Comment on this his owne Text, the very same day it was preached by his vnworthiest seruant. The argument was but audible in the morning, before night it was visible. His holy Pen had long since written it with inke, now his hand of Iustice expounded it in the Characters of bloud, There, was onely a conditionall menace, So it shall be: here a terrible remonstrance, So it is. Sure! He did not meane it for a nine daies won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Their sudden departure out of the World, must not so suddenly depart from the memorie of the World. Woe to that soule that shall take so slight a notice of so extraordinary a Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We doe not say, They perished: Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie forbid it. But this wee say, It is a signe of Gods fauour, when hee giues a man Law. Wee

passe no sentence vpon them, yet let vs take war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by them. The Remarkablenesse would not be neglected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Time, the Place, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the Number, the Maner. Yet still wee conclude not, This was for the transgression of the dead: but this we are sure of, It is meant for the admonition of the liuing.</p>
                  <p>Such is our Blessed Sauiours conclusion, vpon a paralel instance: <hi>Except ye repent, YE shal all LIKEWISE perish.</hi> There is no place safe. e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ough for offenders: but when the Lord is once vp in armes, happy man that can make his owne peace! otherwise, in vaine we hope to runne from the Plague, while we carry the Sinne along with vs. Yet will not our wilfull and bewitched Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants, from these legible Characters, spell Gods plaine meaning. No impression can bee made in those hearts, that are ordained to perish. For their malicious, causelesse, and vnchristian censures of vs, God forgiue them: our requitall be onely pitie and prayers for them. Howsoeuer they giue out, (and I will not here examine) that their piety is more then ours: Impudence it selfe cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but our Charitie is greater then theirs. Now the holy feare of God keepe vs in the wayes of Faith and Obedience; that the properation of Death may neuer preuent our preparation to die. And yet still, after our best endeauor; <hi>From sudden death good Lord deliuer vs all.</hi> Amen.</p>

                        <p>Then said hee to the Dresser of his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; Behold, these three yeares I come seeking fruit on this Fig-tree, and find none: cut it downe, why cumbreth it the ground?</p>
                     </q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ewes is brought to Christ, of a certaine Iudgement, which was not more <hi>Pilates,</hi> then Gods, vpon some Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans; who, while they were sacrificing, were sacrificed; their blood being mingled with the blood of the beasts,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16051:47"/>
on the same altar. Lest this should be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attributed to <hi>Pilates</hi> crueltie, without due respect had of the omnipotent Iustice, hee samples it with another; of eighteene men miscarrying by the fall of a Tower. No <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> threw downe this, here was no humane Executioner: the matter of their death was morter and stones, these had no purpose to kill them. This therefore, must bee an inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible hand, working by an insensible creature: the Instrument may bee diuers, the Iudge is the same.</p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>Poena paucorum, terror omnium:</hi> as an exhalation drawne from the earth, fired and sent backe againe to the earth, smites onely one place, but terrifieth the whole countrey. So their ruines should be our ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, let them teach vs, that they may not touch vs. They are hitherto but like <hi>Moses</hi> his <hi>Rodde</hi> turned into a Serpent: not into a Beare or Lyon, lest it should haue deuoured <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> but into a Serpent, that hee might be more afraid then hurt. It is Gods speciall fauour to vs, that others bee made examples for vs, and not wee made examples for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Nothing could teach them, let them teach vs.</p>
                  <p>Of these fearefull Instances our Sauiour makes this vse; setting downe a peremptory couclusion: <hi>Vel poenitendum, vel pereundum: Except yee repent, yee shall all likewise perish.</hi>

                     </gap>nce is no way to bee auoyded, but by repentance. But here the Iewes might flatter themselues; If wee be greater sinners then they, how comes it to passe that wee speed better then they? To this silent obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Christ makes an Apologicall answere, <hi>verse</hi> 6. You are not spared because you are more righteous, but because God to you is more gracious. You deserue such or sorer Iudgements; and the reason of this impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is not to bee looked for in your inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, but in the Lordes patience: not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you are not worse to him, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee is better to you: who offers you space and grace to amend, if (at least) at last you will bring foorth the fruites of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>There be some termes in the Text; (as that the <hi>Vineyard</hi> is the Church, euery Christian a <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> God the <hi>Owner,</hi> euery Pastor a <hi>Dresser:</hi>) wherein your vnderstandings may well preuent my discour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It is a Parable, therefore not to bee forced euery way, nor made to warrant a conclusion which the Author neuer meant. This were, when it <hi>offers vs the company a myle, to compell it to goe with vs twaine:</hi> or to make Christes Messenger speake our errand. Such is the trade of Rome; what their owne policie hath made necessarie, they will teach God

A Parable is not like a Looking-glasse, to represent all formes and faces: but a well drawne Picture, to remonstrate that person whereof it is a counterfeit. It is like a knife, with the haft it cutts not, with the backe it cuts not, it cuts with the edge. A Candle is made to light vs, not to heate vs: a Stoue is made to heate vs, not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yea, which is worse, they publish Excommunications for sinnes not yet committed: The Lord of a Mannor hath set a rowe of young Elmes, he may haue an Excommunication against all those that shall do them any harme.

                     <hi>Ad nihilum valet, quod non valet ad finem suum.</hi> It is good for nothing, that is not good for the end it was made. If a knife bee not good to cut, we say it is good for nothing: yet may some other vse be inuented for it. If a Plough be not good to breake the ground, we say it is good for nothing; yet it may stop a gap. If a hound be not good to hunt, we say he is good for nothing, yet may he in the night giue warning of a theefe. But if a <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> a Professor be not good for fruit, he is indeed, good for nothing. The refuse of other things haue their vses: sowre Wine will make Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger, olde Rags make Paper, Lees are for Dyers, Soile is good to fat the Land, Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheards and broken tiles to mend high waies, all good for somewhat: yea, they offer to sel

                  <p>We all haue our Stations in the Vineyard, to bring foorth fruits, but what bee those fruits? It was a smart Inuention of him, that hauing placed the Emperour, and the <hi>Pope,</hi> reconciled, in their Maiestick Thrones, he brought the States of the world before them. First comes a Counseller of State, with this Motto, <hi>I Aduise you two:</hi> then a Courtier <hi>I Flatter you three:</hi> then a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, <hi>I Feed you foure,</hi> then a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, <hi>I Coussen you fiue:</hi> then a Lawyer, <hi>I Robbe you sixe</hi>: then a Souldier, <hi>I Fight for you seuen</hi>: then a Physician, <hi>I Kill you eight:</hi> Lastly a Priest, <hi>I absolue you all nine:</hi> This was his Satyre.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong the many absurdities, which giue vs iust cause to abhorre the Religion of the present Roman Church, this seemeth to me none of the least; that they haue filled all the Temples vnder the commaund of their politike Hierarchy, with Idols: and changed the glory of the Inuisible God, into the worship of visible Images. They inuocate the Saints by them, yea they dare not serue the Lord without them. As if God had repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his vnchageable Law; and in stead of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all worship by an Image, would now receiue no worship without an Image. I haue obserued this one, among the other famous markes of that Synagogue; that they striue to condemne that which God hath iustified, and to iustifie what he hath condemned. For the former; He hath precisely directed our Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only by faith in the merits of Christ: this they vehem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ousie) for bidden all worship that hath the least tang of Idolatry: this they eagerly maintaine. What large Volumes haue they written against the <hi>Second Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!</hi> as if they were not content to expunge it out
<pb facs="tcp:16051:76"/>

                     </gap> it to the whole world. They first set the people vpon a plaine rebellion, &amp; then make shew to fetch them off again with a neat distinction. Thus doe they pumpe their wits to legitimate that by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, which God hath pronounced a Bastard by his definitiue sentence: as if the Papall <hi>Decrees</hi> were that law, wherby the world should bee iudged at the last day. But who will regard a house of magnificent structure, of honourable &amp; ancient memory, when the plague hath infected it; or theeues possesse it? And who, in their right senses, will ioyne themselues to that Temple, which after pretence of long standing, stately building, and of many such prerogatiues and royalties, is fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to be be smeared with superstitions, and profaned with innumerable Idols? Why should wee delight to dwell there, where God hath refused to dwell with vs.</p>
                  <p>I publish this argument as no new thing to your Lordship: but, wherein your well experienced know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is able to informe mee.

                  <p>The absurdnes of such a mixture is here illustrated by many oppositions; the sound of all which is Interrogatiue, the sense Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue. <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> and <hi>Vnrighteousnesse, Light</hi> and <hi>Darknesse, Christ</hi> and <hi>Beliall,</hi> the <hi>Beleeuer</hi> and the <hi>Infidel</hi>; these can haue no societie, communion, no concord, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction; and <hi>What agreement hath the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God with Idols?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I need not by Art diuide these words, for they are diuided by nature. Now as <hi>Quae Deus coniunxit, nemo separet,</hi> Those things that God hath ioyned together, let no man put asunder: so <hi>Quae Deus separauit, nemo coniungat,</hi> Those things that God hath put asunder, let no man ioyne together. The scope of the Text, and the matter of my Discourse, is to separate <hi>Idols</hi> from the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16051:77"/>
                     <hi>Temple</hi> of God; the holy <hi>Ghost</hi> hath diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to my hands: they cannot agree in his sentence, let them neuer agree in our practise; cursed is hee that goes about to compound this controuersie. The <hi>Temple</hi> is holy, <hi>Idols</hi> prophane, it is not lawfull to mixe <hi>Sacra profanis.</hi> The <hi>Temple</hi> is for God, <hi>Idols</hi> for the Deuill: God and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill admit no reconciliation. Therefore as two hostile nations, after some treatie of peace, neither liking the proposed conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, breake off in a rage, <hi>In hoc vterque con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentimus, quòd consentire nolumus,</hi> in this we both consent, that we wil not consent at all; so be it heere agreed, that no agreement can bee made. In composing differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt man and man, betwixt family and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, betwixt kingdome and kingdome, <hi>Beati Pacifici,</hi> Blessed are the Peace-makers. But in reconciling Christ and Belial, the <hi>Temple</hi> of God and <hi>Idols, Maledicti pacifici,</hi> Cursed are the peace-makers. Heere <hi>Bella geri place at magnos habitura triumphos.</hi> God himselfe in Paradise did first put the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, his Apostle hath heere giuen the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme, and hee deserues a malediction that sounds a retreat.</p>
                  <p>But as no battell can be well fought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order, and martial array, so no discourse can bee made profitable without some me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. The <hi>Temple</hi> therefore wee will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16051:78"/>
to be Gods Castle, and <hi>Idolatry</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uasion of it. This Castle is but one, Idols are many. The Champions that God hath set to defend his Castle, are especially or principally Princes and Pastors, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy and the Ministery; the aduersary for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that fight against it bee the Deuils mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Souldiers. The Munition on the one side is the Diuine Scripture, the sacred Word of God: the Engines, Ordnance, and Instruments of assault on the other side, are <hi>Idols.</hi> Traditions, and those carnall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, wherewith the corrupt heart of man seekes to batter it. This Siege is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall, this feud implacable, the difference irreconcileable. Yet at last the warre shall end, with the ruine of those enemies, in the triumph of the righteous, and to the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting glory of God?</p>
                  <p>Now though this warre bee euery way spirituall, it is diuers wayes considerable. There is a materiall, and there is a mysticall <hi>Temple:</hi> there are externall, and internall <hi>Idols:</hi> there bee ordinary, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Souldiers. Euery Christian, as hee is a <hi>Temple</hi> of God, so not without the assault of <hi>Idols:</hi> there is a ciuill warre, a Rebellion within him, wherewith hee is continually exercised. In this militant estate of the Church none are free: onely he that giues full allowance to his owne corruptions, is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16051:78"/>
not a Temple of God, but a Synagogue of Satan; a sinke of vncleannesse, rather then a Sanctuary of holinesse. Thus from one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall arise many particulars; and you will say,<note place="margin">Gene. 30.11.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold a company</hi>; as <hi>Leah</hi> said of her sonne <hi>Gad, a Troupe commeth.</hi> Yet all these branches haue but one root: they are but like the wheeles of a Clocke, taken a little in sunder to view, then to bee put together againe. Let not their number discourage your attention. When a wealthy fouourite of the world sent his seruant to be speake lodging for him, he told the Host, Here will come to night the Lord of such a Mannor, the Land-lord of such a Town, the Keeper of such a Forrest, the Master of such an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the Lay-parson of such a Parish, a Knight, a Iustice of Peace, a Gentleman, an Vsurer, and my Master; Alas, answeres the Host, I haue not lodging for halfe so many: Bee content, replies the seruant, for all these are but one man. So if you distrust your memories for roome to entertaine so many obseruations, yet be comforted, for all haue but this one Summe, <hi>There is no agreement betwixt the Temple of God and Idols.</hi>

                     <p>That which was built by <hi>Salomon,</hi> was iustly called the <hi>Wonder</hi> of the world: a white and glorious Monument, set on the

hill of <hi>Sion,</hi> inuiting passengers to see it, and amazing their eyes when they beheld it. It was of white Marble without, of Cedar and Gold within, all of the best, all beautifull, precious, durable. So magnificent was that holy Structure, that al nations haue admired it,<note place="margin">Psalm. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is fit, hee that made the world a house for Man, should haue a house in this world made for himselfe: neither could it be too costly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eeing all the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls that went to it were his owne. Euery rotten Cottage is too good for Satan, no Fabricke could be too sumptuous for God. While his people dwelt in Tents, Himselfe was content to dwell in a Tabernacle: in the flitting condition of Israel, hee would haue his owne house a moueable, that they might neuer remoue without him. But when their residence was setled in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Land, he would haue his Tabernacle turned into a Temple; that they dwelling where he appoynted them, Hee might also dwell among them. The former was for motion, the latter for rest: the one for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse, the other his standing house. All this while God had but one House at once: first the Tabernacle, then that gaue place to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16051:79"/>
the Temple, and <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple being defaced, was supplied by <hi>Zorobabels.</hi> Now he hath many houses, euen so many as there bee nations, as there bee congregations, as there bee persons professing Christ. Wee haue houses of our owne, why should not God haue his? A Prince hath more hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses then one, why should the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen be abridg'd? A King in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can dwell but in one house at once; let God haue neuer so many, hee can at once fill them all. Hee hath a house of flesh, so euery Beleeuer is his Temple: a house of stone, so this materiall one is his Temple: a house neither of flesh nor stone, but imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall, immortall in the heauens. And as Christ sayes,<note place="margin">Iohn 14.</note> that <hi>in his Fathers House there are many Mansions</hi>; so in his Fathers militant Church there are many houses.</p>
                     <p>It were vaine to aske what God should doe with a house, when wee consider what we do with our owne: what, but dwell in it? But how God doth dwell in it, seemes to be a question: seeing the Apostle saith, that <hi>hee dwells not in Temples made with hands:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Actes 17.24.</note> Indeed he dwels not in them, as wee dwell in ours. Our house defends vs, God defends his house: our house comprehends vs, God comprehends his house. Wee are onely within our houses, and they are without vs: God is so within his house, that hee is also
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16051:80"/>
without it, elsewhere, euery where, yea his house is within him. When we are abroad, we cannot keepe our houses; yea when wee are in them asleepe, they serue to keepe vs. God can neuer be absent from his, nor doth the keeper of this <hi>Temple</hi> euer sleepe. Now euery materiall Temple, wherein the Saints are assembled, the truth of the Gospell is preached and professed, the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments duely administred, and the Lords Name is inuocated and worshipped, is the <hi>Temple of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Why is it called <hi>His</hi> Temple, but for the testification of his presence? When <hi>Cain</hi> stood excommunicated for murdering his brother, and might not come to the place appointed for Gods seruice, he is said to be <hi>cast out from the presence of the Lord.</hi>

There humble soules open their grieuances, from thence they returne loaden with graces. Why are many so voyd of goodnesse, but because they are negligent of the publike deuotions? They seek not the Lord where hee may bee found, therefore deserue to misse him where they pretend to seek him. Why should they thinke to finde God in their Closets, while they care not to seeke him in his Temples? When wee need the helpe of our friend, do we tarry till we meet him by chance, or till hee come to vs, or shall wee not rather go home to his house? <hi>Peter and Iohn went vp into the Temple at the houre of Prayer:</hi>

aboue, the glorious kingdome of Iesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>These bee the enemies to the Temple, whereof the first would separate <hi>Dominum à Templo,</hi> the other <hi>templum à Domino:</hi> they would take God from the Temple, these would take the Temple from God. Let mee conclude this poynt with two watch-words.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The first concernes vs of the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the wayters of the Temple. It hath been an old saying, <hi>De Templo omne bonum, de Templo omne malum:</hi> all good or euill comes from the Temple.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Chrys.</hi>
                        </note> Where the Pastor is good, and the people good, hee may say to them,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.1.</note> as <hi>Paul</hi> to his <hi>Corinthians, Nonne opus meum vos estis in Domino, Are not ye my work in the Lord?</hi> Where the Pastor is bad, and the people no better, they may say to him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
                        <hi>Nonne destructis nostra tu es in seculo,</hi> art not thou our destruction in the world? It is no wonder, if an abused Temple make a disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered people. A wicked Priest is the worst creature vpon Gods earth: no sinne is so blacke, as that shall appeare from vnder a white Surplesse. Euery mans iniquitie is so much the hainouser, as his place is holyer. The sinne of the Clergy is like a Rheume, which rising from the stomach into the head, drops downe vpon the lungs, fretting the most noble and vitall parts, till all the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16051:84"/>
members languish into corruption. The lewd sonnes of <hi>Eli</hi> were so much the lesse tolerable, by sinning in the Tabernacle. Their sacrifices might doe away the sinnes of others; no sacrifice could doe away their owne. Many a soule was the cleaner for the blood of those beasts they shed; their owne soules were the fouler by it. By one and the same seruice, they did expiate the peoples offences, and multiply their owne. Our Clergie is no Charter for heauen. Such men are like the conueyances of Land, Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and Instruments to settle others in the kingdome of heauen, while themselues haue no part of that they conuey. It is no vnpossible thing, for men at once to shew the way to Heauen with their tongue, and lead the way to Hell with their foot. It was not a Iewish Ephod, it is not a Romish Cowle, that can priuiledge an euill doer from punishment. Therefore it was Gods charge to the executioners of his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">Ezek. 9.6. 1 Pet. 4.17. Iohn 2.15.</note> 
                        <hi>Begin at my owne Sanctuary:</hi> and the Apostle tells vs, that <hi>Iudgement shall begin at the house of God:</hi> and Christ entring into his Propheticall Office, began reformation at his Fathers house. Let our deuout and holy behauiour preuent this; and by our reuerent carriage in the Temple of God, let vs ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the God of the Temple. It should be our endeuour <hi>to raise vp seed vnto our elder
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16051:84"/>
Brother,</hi>

                        </note> to winne soules vnto Christ. <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam cessate lucrari Christo, qui lucrati estis à Christo.</hi> If Christ, while hee was vpon the Crosse, saith <hi>Bernard,</hi> had giuen mee some drops of his owne blood in a Violl, how carefully would I haue kept them, how dearely esteemed them, how laid them next my heart? But now he did not thinke it fit to trust me with those drops, But hee hath intrusted to me a flocke of his lambes, those soules for whom hee shed his blood, like whom his owne blood was not so deare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: vpon these let mee spend my care, my loue, my labour, that I may present them holy Saints to my deare Lord Iesus.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The other concernes all Christians; that they beware, lest for the abuses of men, they despise the Temple of God. For as the Altar cannot sanctifie the Priest, so nor can the vnholinesse of the Priest dishallow the Altar. His sin is his owne, and cannot make you guiltie: the vertue and comfort is from God, and this is still able to make you holy. When wee read,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.17.</note> that <hi>the sinne of the Priests was great before the Lord, for men abhorred the offering of the Lord</hi>: this we all confesse, was ill done of the Priests; and I hope no man thinks, it was well done of the people. Say their sinnes, yea their very persons were worthy to be abhorred, shall men therefore scorne the Sanctuary, &amp; cast that contempt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16051:85"/>
on the Seruice of God, which belongs to the vices of man? This were to adde our owne euill to the euill of others, and to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God because he was offended. Cannot the faults of men displease vs, but wee must needs fall out with God? Doe we not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke him iustly to abhorre our soules, when we so vniustly contemne his seruice? Know, that he is able to sanctifie thy heart, euen by the ministery of that man whose heart hee hath not yet sanctified. The vertue consists not in the humane action, but in the diuine Institution. Wee say of the Sacraments themselues, much more of the Ministers; <hi>Isti non tribuunt, quod per istos tribuitur:</hi> these doe not giue vs, what God doth giue vs by them.</p>
                     <p>But this age is ficke of such a wanton le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie, that wee make choyce of the Temple, according to our fancy of the Preacher: and so tye vp the free Spirit of God from blowing where he pleaseth, that he shall be beholding to the grace of the Speaker, for giuing grace to the hearer. So whereas <hi>Paul</hi> ties Faith to hearing, they will tie hearing to Faith; and as they beleeue the holinesse of the man, so they expect fruit of the Sermon. This is to make <hi>Paul</hi> something, and <hi>Apollos</hi> something; wheras <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe sayes they are <hi>both nothing.</hi> God onely giues the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and who shall appoint him by whom
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16051:85"/>
he shall giue it? Let the feed bee good, and the ground good, and the Lord will send fruit whosoeuer bee the Sower. But while you make hearing a matter of sport, Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching is too often become an exercise of wit. Words are but the Images of matter, and (you shall heare anon) it is not lawfull to worship Images. It dangerously mis becomes the Temple, when any thing shall bee intended there, but the glory of God, and gaining of soules to Iesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>Thus much concerning <hi>the Temple</hi>; the next poynt I must fall vpon is</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Idol</hi> in Greeke signifies a resemblance or representation, and differs not from <hi>Image</hi> in Latine: both at first taken in a good sense: but the corruption of times hath bred a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of words; and <hi>Idol</hi> is now only ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the Image of a false god. Euery <hi>Idol</hi> is an Image, but euery Image is not an Idol: but euery Image made and vsed for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purposes, is an Idol. The Images of God are Idols; wherwith Popery abounds. An old man, sitting in a chaire, with a triple Crowne on his head, and Pontificall robes on his backe, a Doue hanging at his beard, and a Crucifixe in his armes; is their Image of the Trinitie. This Picture sometime serues them for a god in their Churches,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16051:86"/>
and somtime for a signe at th ir tap-houses: so that it is a common saying in many of their Cities, Such a Gentleman lyes at the Trinity, and his seruants at Gods head. This they seeme to doe, as if they would in some sort requite their Maker: because God made man according to his Image, therfore they, by way of recompence, will make God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to mans Image. But this certainly they durst not doe, without putting the second Commandement out of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techismes, and the whole Decalogue out of their Consciences.</p>
                     <p>I intend no polemicall discourse of this poynt, by examining their Arguments: that businesse is fitter for the Schoole, then the Pulpit. And, O God, that either Schoole or Pulpit in Christendome should be troubled about it! that any man should dare to make that a question, which the Lord hath so plainely and punctually forbidden! Beside the Iniquity, how grieuous is the absurdity? How is a body without a spirit, like to a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit without a body? A visible picture, like an inuisible nature? How would the King take it in scorne, to haue his picture made like a Wesell or a Hedgehog? And yet the difference betwixt the greatest Monarch, and the least Emmet, is nothing to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance betwixt a finite &amp; an infinite. If they alledge with the Anthropomorphites, that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16051:86"/>
the Scripture attributes to God hands, and feet, and eyes: why therefore may they not represent him in the same formes? But we say, the Scripture also speaks of his couering vs with the Shadow of his wings; why ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do they not paint him like a Bird with feathers? If they say, that he appeared to <hi>Daniel</hi> in this forme, because hee is there called the <hi>Ancient of dayes:</hi> wee answere, that Gods Commandements, and not his apparitions, be rules to vs: by the former we shall be iudged and not by the latter. It is mad Religion, to neglect what he bids vs doe, and to imitate what he hath done: as if we should despise his Lawes, and goe about to counterfeit his thunder. God is too infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite for the comprehension of our soules, why should we then labour to bring him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the narrow compasse of bords &amp; stones? Certenly, that should not be <hi>Imaged,</hi> which cannot be <hi>Imagined.</hi> But Christ was a man, why may not his Image be made? Some answer, that no man can make an Image of Christ, without leauing out the chiefe part of him, which is his Diuinitie. It was the Godhead vnited to the manhood, that makes him Christ: sure this cannot be pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But why should wee make Christs I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage without Christs warrant? The Lord hath forbidden the making of any Image, whether of things in heauen, where Christ
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:16051:87"/>
is; or of things on earth, where Christ was; to worship them. Now till God reuoke that precept, what can authorise this practice?</p>
                     <p>Their Images of the Saints, employed to such religious purposes, make them no lesse then <hi>Idolaters.</hi> It is a silly shift to say, the honor done to the Images, reflects vpon the represented Saints.

Let vs not thinke them so vnreasonable, as to thinke that Calfe a God; or that the Idoll which they made to day, did bring them out of Egipt three moneths before. It was the true God they meant to worship in the Calfe, and yet (at the best) euen that Idolatry was damnable. So charitie bids vs hope of the Papists, that they doe not take that bord or stone for their God, yet withall wee find that God doth take them for Idolaters. They tell vs (with a new distinction ) that they forbid the people, to giue Diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to Images: but we say, they had better forbid the people to haue Images. A blocke lies in the high way, and a watchman is set by it to warne the Passengers; Take heed, heere is a blocke. But how if the watchman fall a sleepe? Whether is the safer course, quite to remoue the blocke out of the way, or to trust the passengers safetie vpon the watchmans vigilancie? As for their watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, commonly they are as very Images as the Images themselues: and how should

one blocke remoue another? When <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> had set vp his two Idols in Israel, hee I rakes vp his Priests out of the common kennell; the basest of the people were good enough for such a bastard deuotion: wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den priests were fit enough to wayt vpon golden Deities.

                        <hi>Israel</hi> cals for gods; but why should this god of theirs be fashioned like a <hi>Calfe?</hi> What may bee the reason of this shape? Whence had they the originall of such an Idol? Most likely in Egypt: they had seen a blacke Calfe with white spots worshipped there. This Image stil ran in their minds, and stole their hearts, &amp; now they long to haue it set vp before their eyes. Egypt wil not out of their fancies: when they wanted meat, they thought of the Egyptian flesh-pots: now they want <hi>Moses,</hi> they thinke of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian Idols. They brought gold out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt; that very gold was contagious; the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Eare-rings and Iewels of Egypt are fit to make Idols. The Egyptian burdens made them run to the true God, the Egyptian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples led them to a false god. What meane our wanderers by running to Rome &amp; such superstitious places; vnlesse they were weary of the Church of God, &amp; would fetch home Idols? If it were granted, that there is some little truth among them, yet who is so sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as to seeke his corne among a great heap of chaffe, and that far off; who may haue it at home, winnowed and clensed to his hand?</p>
                     <p>The very sight of euill is dangerous, and they bee rare eyes that doe not conuey this poison to our hearts. I haue heard of some, that euen by laboring in the Spanish galleys, haue come home the slaues of their supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

Egypt was alwayes an vnlucky place for Israel, as Rome is for England. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple soiourned there, and they brought home one <hi>Calfe: Ieroboam</hi> soiourned there, and he brought home <hi>Two calues:</hi>

                     <p>Consider it well, ye that make no scruple of superstitious assemblies; it will bee hard for you to dwell in a Temple of Idols vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted.

                     <head>The Temple of God</head>
                     <p>Is the <hi>Church</hi> of Christ, and they are so like, that we often interchange the tearmes, calling a Temple the Church, &amp; the Church a Temple of God. The materiall Temple vnder the Law was a figure of the spirituall vnder the Gospell. The former was distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished into three roomes; the Porch, the holy place, and the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> or Holy of holies. The Porch prefigured Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, which is the doore whereby we enter into the Church of Christ. The Holy place, the communion of the militant church vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly earth, separated from the world. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of holies, whereinto the high Priest only entred, &amp; that once a yeare, presignified the glorious kingdome of heauen, wherinto the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> entred once for all. There was one Court of the Temple common, whither accesse was denied to none: though they were vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>leane or vncircumcised, thus farre they might be admitted. There was another Court within that, allowed to none but the Israelites, &amp; of them to none but the cleane. There was a third, proper only to the Priests and Leuites, whither the Laitie might not come: thus farre they might bring their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, but further they might not offer to goe. In the Temple it selfe there was one roome, into which the Leuites might not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16051:95"/>
enter, the Priests might. Another, whither the Priests might not come; but onely the high Priest, and euen hee but once yearely. Some passages of the Christian Church are common to all, euen to the vncleane hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and foule-hearted sinners. They haue accesse to Gods holy ordinances, and tread in his Courts; as the Pharisee came into the congregation, and <hi>Iudas</hi> receiued the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Other are secret and reserued, wherein the faithfull onely conuerse with God, and solace themselues in the sweet fruition of his gracious presence.</p>
                     <p>The materiall Temple in three diuisions, seemed to be a cleare representation of the Church in three degrees. The first signified the externall and visible face of the Church, from which no professor of Christ is debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The second, the communion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible Church vpon earth. The last, the highest heauen of Gods glorified Saints. Neither did those roomes more exceed one another then do these parts of the spirituall house of Christ. What are the most polished corners of the Temple, to the spirituall &amp; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing stones of the Church? What be pebles to Saphirs, or marbles to Diamonds? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer some are more transported with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible monuments, then with liuing Saints. As it was a complaint long since, <hi>Fulget Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia in parietibus, luget in pauperibus.</hi> Yet
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16051:96"/>
Temples are built for men, not men for Temples: and what is a glorious edifice, when the whole world is not worth one soule? Dead walls bee of small value, to the liuing Temples of the holy Ghost: yea, the temple of our body, to the temple of Christs Body, his Church: yea the Temple of Gods Church militant on earth, to that which is triumphant in heauen. What is siluer and gold, Cedar and Marble, to those diuine gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, faith, truth, pietie, holinesse? <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple did last but some 430. yeares, the Church is for eternitie. The Temple took vp but a little space of ground, at most the Hill Sion, the Church is vniuersally spread: in all parts of the world God hath his chosen.</p>
                     <p>Did our intellectuall eyes truely behold the beauty of this Temple, wee would with that good Emperor, esteeme it better to be a member of the Church, then head of the kingdome. We would set this one thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all worldly glories. As when <hi>Henry</hi> 4. that late <hi>Great</hi> king of France, was told of the king of Spaines ample dominions: as first he is king of <hi>Castile,</hi> and I (quoth <hi>Henry</hi>) am king of France: he is king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and I am king of France: he is king of <hi>Portugall,</hi> and I am king of France: he is king of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and I am king of France: he is king of the <hi>Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the West Indies, and I
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16051:96"/>
am king of France; he thought the kingdome of France equiualent to all these. So let thy soule, O Christian, solace it selfe against all the wants of thy mortall pilgrimage, in this, that thou art a member of the church. Another hath more wit or learning, yet I am a Christian: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other hath more honour and preferment on earth, yet I am a Christian: another hath more siluer and gold and riches, yet I am a Christian: another hath large possessions, yet I haue an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in heauen, I am a Christian. <hi>Dauid</hi> thought it not so happy to bee a King in his owne house, as to bee a doore-keeper in Gods house. Were our hearts throughly sanctified, we would vnder-value all honours to this, that we are parts of this spirituall Temple, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Iesus Christ.</p>

To say, the Saints in heauen know the occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of this nether world, and the condition of their ancient friends or children below, reading them in the Deitie, as by the reflection of a glasse; this is a fiction that carries a shew of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring God: but it doth indeed dishonor him, by making creatures as omniscient as their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.

                     <p>It is a foolish thought, that God will bee glorified by a lie. Our iudiciall Astrologers, that tye mens destinies to the Starres and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, pretend Gods honour, who hath giuen such vertue and influence to his creatures; but indeed make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no better then Idols.

                     <p n="2">2. It is <hi>Domus orationis</hi>; they must haue the continuall exercises of Prayer. <hi>In Templo vis o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare? In te ora.</hi> Wouldst thou pray in Gods Temple? Pray in thy selfe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The sound of the high praises of God must bee heard in these Temples: <hi>There euery man speaks of his honour.</hi> It pleaseth the Lord to <hi>inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite the praises of Israel.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. 38.9.</note> And <hi>Psal.</hi> 48.<hi>Wee haue thought of thy louing kindnes, 0 God, in the midst of thy Temple:</hi> that is, euen in the midst of our selues, in our owne hearts. There let vs think vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his mercies, there eccho forth his praises.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Inhabitant disposeth all the roomes

of his house: if God dwell in vs, let him rule vs. Submit thy will to his word, thy affections to his Spirit. It is fit that euery man should beare rule in his owne house.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Let vs bee glad when hee is in vs, and giue him no disturbance. Let not the foulenes of any roome make him dislike his habitation. Cleanse all the sluttish corners of sinne, and perfume the whole house with <hi>Myrrhe &amp; Cassia.</hi> Still be get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting neerer to thy Land-lord: other Inhabitants come home to their houses; but here the house must striue to come home to the Inhabitant. Whensoeuer God comes toward thee, meet him by the way, and bid him welcome to his owne.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Lastly, if we be the Lords houses, then no bodies else. The materiall Temples are not to bee diuerted to common offices: much more should the spirituall be vsed only for Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. Let vs not alienate his rights: thus hee will say, <hi>This is my house, heere will I dwell, for I haue a delight therein.</hi> O may we so adorne these Temples with graces, that God may take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to dwell in vs.</p>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:16051:108"/>
Iustice said of the ill-shap'd Rood, thogh it be not well fauoured enough for a god, it will serue to make an excellent deuill. So proud dust and ashes, that arrogates the honor of God, and impropriates it to himselfe; though he be too foule for a Temple, yet he is fit enough for an Idol. When <hi>David</hi> prayes, <hi>Libera me ab homine malo, Deliuer me from the euill man, O Lord.</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> after much study and scrutiny to find out this euill man, at last lights vpon him; <hi>ab ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine malo,</hi> that is, <hi>à me ipso: Deliuer me from the euill man,</hi> deliuer me from <hi>my selfe</hi>; Deliuer <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> from <hi>Augustine</hi>; I am that <hi>euill</hi> man. So, of all Idolatries, God deliuer vs from a supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious worship of our selues. Some haue Idolized their Princes, some their Mistresses, some their Manufactures; but they are innumerable that haue Idolized themselues. He is a rare man that hath no Idol, no little god in a boxe, no espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall sinne in his heart, to which he giues vxori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and affectionate Indulgence.</p>
                     <p>The only way to mend all, is for euery man to begin with himself. In vain shall we blame those faults abroad, which we tolerate at home. That man makes himself ridiculous, who leauing his own house on fire, runs to quench his neigbors Let but euery man pull a brand from this fire, the flame will go out alone: if euery soule clense his owne Temple, all shall be quit of Idols, and God wil accept of all. A multitude is but a heap of vnities; the more we take away, the fewer we leaue behind. When a field is ouer growne with weeds, the best course to haue a good generall
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:16051:108"/>
haruest, is for euery man to weed his owneground. When we would haue the street cleansed let euery man sweep his owne doore, and it is quickly done. But while euery man censures, &amp; none amends, we do but talk against Idols, with still vnclensed Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples.</p>
                     <p>Let vs pray for vniuersall repentance, like a good <hi>Iosias,</hi> to purge the houses of God. till lust and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanenesse, pride and couetousnesse, fraud and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse, malice and drunkennes, be no more found among vs: till euery thing be cast out, and nothing let in, that is vncleane. So shall the Lord dwell in vs with content, and we shall dwell in him with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Here we shall be a Temple for Him, hereafter he shall be a temple for vs. So we find that glorious Citie describe, <hi>I saw no Temple therein,</hi>

                        <hi>but the Lord God Almightie, and the Lambe was the Temple of it.</hi> Wee are Gods Temple on earth, God shall bee our Temple in heauen. To this purpose, the Spirit of God sanctifie vs, and bee for euer sanctified in vs. Amen.</p>
                     <p>Some may haply (long ere this) haue preuidica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their censures; How is this <hi>O pus diet in die sou?</hi> What is all this to the businesse of the day? I might haue preuented the obiection, by comparing Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie with Treason: the one being a breach of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to the Lord, the other a breach of allegiance to the Lords Annointed. Idolatry is a Treason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, and Treason is kind of Idolatry against the King. From both which the diuine grace, and our holy obedience deliuer vs all. I conclude with application to the Time.</p>
                     <p>This is one of those blessed dayes celebrated for the deliuerance of our gracious Soueraigne: and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:16051:109"/>
well may the deliuerance of a King, of such a King, deserue a day of gratulation. When God deliuers a priuate man, he doth, as it were, repeat his Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but the deliuerance of a King, is alwayes a choyce piece in the Lords Chronicle. The Story, how he was endangered, and how preserued, this place hath diuers times witnessed; and that in a more punctuall manner, then I haue either strength, or art, or time to match. A hard time it seemed to be, when a King was imprisoned, when he had no guard with him but his Innocency, no subiect but a Traytor. But there was a stronger with him, then all they could be against him. A good Prince hath more guards then one: he hath, 1. a subsidiary guard, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of morrall men. 2. An inward guard, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie of his owne Conscience: 3. A spirituall guard, the prayers of his faithfull subiects. 4. A ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial guard, the protection of diligent &amp; powerfull Angels. 5. A diuine guard, his Makers prouidence that fenceth him in with a wall of fire, which shall at once both preserue him, and consume his enemies.</p>
                     <p>But my purpose is not to bring your thoughts back to the view of his perill, but to stir your hearts vp to thankfulnesse for his preseruation. He is iustly styled, <hi>The Defender of the Faith:</hi> he hath euer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the Faith, and the Faith hath euer defended him. Hee hath preserued the Temple of God from Idols, and therefore God hath preserued him from all his enemies. Surely that Prouidence, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered him from those early Conspiracies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he hath been assaulted from his cradle, meant him for some extraordinary benefit, and matchlesse good to the Christian world. Hee that gaue him
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:16051:109"/>
both life and Crowne(almost)together, hath still miraculously preserued them both, from all the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging violences of Rome and Hell. Now when the Lord deliuered him, what did he else but euen deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs all? That we might reioyce in his safety, as the Romans did in the recouery of <hi>Germanicus</hi>; when they ran with lampes and sacrifices to the Capitoll, and there sung with shouts and acclamations; <hi>Salua Roma, salua Patria, saluus Germanicus:</hi> the Citie is safe, the Country is safe, and all in the safetie of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicus.</hi> While we consider the blessings which we enioy by his gracious Gouernment; that the estates we haue gotten with honest industry, may be safely conueyed to our posterity: that we sit vnder the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of peace, and may teach our children to know the Lord: that the good man may build vp Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Hospitals, without trembling to thinke of sauage and barbarous violences to pull them down: that our Deuotions be not molested with vproares, nor men called from their callings by mutinies: that our Temples be not profaned with Idols, nor the Seruice of God blended with superstitious deuices: that our temporall estate is preserued in liberity, our spirituall estate may bee improued in pietie, and our eternall estate assured vs in glory: that our liues be protected, and in quiet our soules may be saued: for such a King of men, blesse we the God of Kings; and sing for his deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as they did for their <hi>Germani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>; as priuatly euery day, so this day in our publike Assemblies; <hi>Salua Britannia, Salua Ecclesia, saluus</hi> IACOBVS: Our Kingdome is safe, the Church of God is safe, our whole Estate is safe, wee are all safe and happie, in the safetie and happinesse of King

                     <p>For these publike &amp; extraordinary blessings, God requires publike and extraordinary praises: that this great Assembly with prepared hearts, and religious affections, should magnifie his glorious Name: &amp; if it were possible, by some vnusuall strain of our vnited tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks, pierce the very skies, &amp; giue an Eccho to those celestiall Quires, singing, Honor, &amp; praise, and glory, bee to our gracious God, for all his mercifull deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances both of Prince and people.
