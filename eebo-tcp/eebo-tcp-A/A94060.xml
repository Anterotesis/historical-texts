            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving ſeen a paper Printed, reflecting on the perſon and labours of my Dear Husband Mr. <hi>William Strong;</hi> I was much amazed, eſpecially it being ſuppoſed to have proceeded from men reputed Godly: And now the leſs wondering, that a Miniſter of note ſhould be of late deceived by their inſinuations, little ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting (as what honeſt heart would) that under a pretext of general advantage, ſuch men ſhould drive on deſigns: who, being once diſturbed in their deſign for profit, ſtick not with open face to caſt unhandſom and unjuſt reflections on the memory of him, whoſe works they pretend to propagate and promulge: I need not touch at their reflections (any thing of calumny wiping it ſelf off by its own hand) referring thee to the teſtimonies Prefacing his Tract of the <hi>Heavenly Treaſure,</hi> or <hi>Mans chiefeſt Good,</hi> newly extant: I have only a word touching matter of fact, which is clearly thus: One piece after another appearing in Print, done without my privacy, and (according to truth, and experience of ſuch as ſhall compare theſe things already done) very imperfect. A friend diſperſes a ſmall note, adviſing that the ſaid Copy, named <hi>The Saints communion with God, and Gods Communion with them in Ordinances,</hi> Printed for <hi>Geo. Sawbridge,</hi> and <hi>Robert Gibbs,</hi> was an imperfect Copy; which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his was really true: This is followed by a ſcandalous paper from them (as ſuppoſed) wherein they tell the world, <hi>That Mr.</hi> Strong <hi>left all his notes under a Character of his own deviſing,</hi> and ſay, <hi>It is impoſſible any man ſhould publiſh any things by his own notes.</hi> Out of what deſign they Print ſo known an untruth, I ſay not, unleſs either to raiſe prejudices againſt thoſe excellent things he left behind him (not conſidering how dangerous it is to be laying ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks in the way of ſouls: offences may come, but woe be to them by whom they do) or elſe, (not inconſiſtent with the former) to ſpoil mine and my childrens benefits, we might otherwiſe receive by thoſe my husbands labours: There are ſome things <hi>not to be named among Chriſtians:</hi> my thinks this is one: The Lord forgive this un-chriſtian dealing, I do: But this I aſſure thee, on the word of a Chriſtian, the widdow of a Miniſter, and (through Gods merey) of good repute: That my ſaid Husband did never in his life time Print any thing but by his own notes, and not as he ſpoke in the Pulpit, judging that the worſer way: And that he wrote <hi>Willis</hi> his Characters, adding here and there ſome of his own, ſufficiently known to, and underſtood by that perſon of honour (and to many others who are able to read them) to whom he committed his notes, many of them in his life-time, with a charge, that if any thing ſhould be Printed, it ſhould be done by them: Directing alſo to what things (if any) he would have done firſt: All his things, being ready prepared thereto, and fitted by himſelf (ſave only tranſcription) by his own hand: except only one diſcourſe, lying unſtitched (his other things being all ſtitched by his own hand) in his ſtudy at the time of his death; and ſo diſplaced by the ſad confuſions thereof: many things were accordingly in long hand wrote out, and by himſelf in part looked over ere he dyed. Some things, good part Printed and done by himſelf with marginal annotations ere he dyed: which will all (in Gods due time) come out, word for word as himſelf wrote them, if I may be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have the diſpoſe thereof. Among other things, is now compleatly finiſhed for the preſs, that Tract on <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. which God ſending, will carry with it its own evidence; neither is there any licking over his notes, (as the Authors of that paper pleaſe to phraſe it) more then a careful review, without the leaſt alteration from his notes: Not like that of theirs, concerning which I ſhall give thee one teſt: its not found in all my husbands Notes, wherein he gives more then ſome few ſignificant Hebrew words, here and there (not whole lines, as in theirs now pubiſht) and not any of them ever wrote in a Latine Character. I ſhall only add, my caſe is the ſame with the widdow (that may be) of any Godly and able Miniſter now living: the unjuſtice is much to me, and the injury to the Church. Let this ſerve for general ſatisfaction.</p>
