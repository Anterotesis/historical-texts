         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And albeit through Gods grace we be not bound to
geue accompt of our actions to any but himſelfe, yet to
the ende the ſimplicitie of ſome of our ſubiectes be not
through their falſe ſuggeſtions abuſed and that they
ſhould wrongfully imagine the late Duke of Guiſe to
haue bene puniſhed for being the protector and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Catholicke Apoſtolicke and Romiſh Religion,
or for his good affection to the commons, and that in
reſpect thereof the ſaid Duke of Mayenne, Duke and
Knight of Aumalle, and their aſſociates may haue had
great and lawfull occaſion to vnite themſelues, as well
for their own particular preſeruation, together with the
maintenaunce of Religion, as for the reuenge of him that
dyed for them, as they doe report whereby to ſtirre vp
and ſeduce our ſubiects and to cloake their ambitious
rebellion. Our pleaſure is thereby fullie to giue them,
to vnderſtand that wickedly they haue ſought to couer
their diſloyaltie with the honour of God, the increaſe of
Religion and affection to the common wealth: for not to
ſtay vpon the particularities of the ſaid Duke of Guiſe
and his brothers liues, the memory whereof is but to
freſh yet in this Realme, eſpecially among ſuch as were
beſt acquainted with them, &amp; not to waſt ſo much time
about the writing thereof, it ſhall ſuffiſe vs onely to ſay
that a few daies before the Duke of Guiſes death, the ſaid
Duke of Mayenne ſent vs word by an honorable Knight,
Syr Alphonſo Corſe, whom he ſent to vs, that it was not
enough for his brother to weare beades about his necke,
but that alſo it was requiſite he ſhould haue a ſoule or
conſcience: that we ſhould looke well to our ſelues: that
it were good himſelfe the ſayd Duke of Mayenne, or the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12912:4"/>
ſaid Knight ſhould come to aduertiſe vs, and that the
terme was ſo ſhort, as it was to be feared he could not
arriue time enough. As alſo we haue not loſt the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances
and letters conteyning his practiſes and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of amitie with the king of Nauarre, aud the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes,
as well within the Realme as without, vpon what
ſoeuer conditions in caſe they would promiſe him their
amitie and aſſiſtance for his eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>It is likewiſe ſufficiently knowen what penſions he
receaued from ſtraungers, vpon what promiſes, and to
what end: &amp; his confederates with ſuch as he did moſt
condemne before men as fauorers of hereſie, are not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen
to any, but thoſe that liſt not to know the ſame.
Theſe be thoſe notable actes that he hath taken out of
the liues of the Apoſtles and Gods commaundementes,
for the preſeruation of the Catholicke Apoſtolicke, and
Romiſh Religion and the relief of the people: whereas
contrariwiſe it is well knowen where abouts our armies
were employed, that our intent was this ſpring perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to haue gone forward, and that there was no let in
vs, why the ſaid Duke of Mayne ſhould not warre vpon
the heretickes, as well as our deare and faithfull Coſin
the Duke of Neuers, who had yet continued our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,
had not our forces bene diuerted by the ſaid Duke
of Mayenne and the Duke and Knight of Aumalle, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
the ſaid Duke of Aumalle did the like the laſt yeare
by ſurpriſing our Townes in Picardie: and it may be ſaid
by the workes of their handes, that the Huguenots had
neuer found ſo great fauour, neither this poore Realme
ſuch miſery and oppreſſion, but in the ſoule and life of the
late Duke of Guiſe, the Duke of Mayenne, and the Duke
and Knight of Aumalle: As for the relief of the people let
the preſent eſtate of this Realme be conſidered, the loſſes
&amp; deſtructions that it hath encurred ſince the yeare 1585
when the ſaid late Duke of Guiſe, with the aforeſaid of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:12912:5"/>
Mayenne and Aumalle tooke armes againſt vs &amp; our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
&amp; let the iminent deſtruction of this realme be
deemed by ſuch occurre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces as haue happened ſince that
time, &amp; ſo compared with the former yeares of 83. &amp; 84.
as alſo the order that we had begon to take &amp; eſtabliſhe
in this our ſayd Realm to the honor of God, &amp; the eaſe of
our people, and agree their relief and the charges of the
warre with the actions of the ſaid late Duke of Guiſe, and
the aforenamed, who ſince that time neuer laid aſide
their weapons, ſometimes vnder one pretence &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
vnder an other, note alſo the countenaunce of the
ſayd late Duke of Guiſe and his aſsiſtantes when we, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his expectation, graunted vnto the deputies of
our Eſtats, the diſcharge and reductions of tallages to
the ſtate they were in An. 1576. alwayes prouided that
they would miniſter meanes to ſupply the ſtocke and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the enterteinement of the Royall dignitie and the
eſtate, and to proſecute the warre which they all had
ſo ſolemnely deſired and ſworne, wherein them ſelues
ſhould by our decree, haue the adminiſtration of the
coyne, as they had promiſed vs: for at that tyme on
the one ſide he diſſwaded vs from doing it, willing vs not
to abaſe our authority ſo far, but to make our ſelues to be
beleued, and on the other ſide he vrged his partakers to
proceede in ſuch their inſtant ſuites, yet not vpon any
earneſt deſire thereto, but rather to bring vs either into
neceſſitie or into hatred with our ſaid ſubiectes, with firm
reſolution, vpon our refuſall, to breake vp the Eſtates,
vpon ſo plauſible a grounde to the people and him ſelfe
to reape the honour and thankes for that whiche he
leaſt meant, reiecting vpon vs the enuie for that which
we extremely deſired: and whiche we did vpon our
great affection to the relief of our ſubiectes, ſo farre as
in vs might lye, and that the preſeruation of our Eſtate
woulde permitte, euen contrary to his aduiſe and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:12912:5"/>
counſell, and all ſuch perſwaſions as he vſed either by
him ſelfe or his to the contrary.</p>
            <p>Alſo in reſpect of his behauiours toward vs, after
we had remitted and pardoned al his former tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
his raſh arrogancie was growen to be ſuch, that
the opinions in our Counſell were no longer free, he
made him ſelfe to be beleeued. The execution alſo
of ſentences and iudgementes giuen in our ſoueraigne
Courtes, agaynſt the moſt lewde and guiltie in this
lande was deferred in that they could not be caught,
and yet were they ſafe in his trayne and chamber,
yea and he procured them to be lodged in our Court, ſo
as they were the honeſteſt men &amp; moſt zealous Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes
of this Realme, if once they were his parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers:
And contrarywiſe the honeſteſt, and beſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicque
was an hereticque, or at the leaſt a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticque,
in caſe hee would not ſweare and take parte in
their treaſon.</p>
            <p>Hee likewiſe did all that hee might, that euerye
man might know (and it was one of his pollicyes) that
he could doe what hee would: and that we had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
caſt our ſelues into his armes, ſo farre foorth
as to cauſe ſuch rumours to bee ſpread throughout
our Prouinces, and to face the Deputies of our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
Eſtates, whiche woulde not depende vppon
him, and alter their bookes at his pleaſure, albeit
there were but ouer manye ſuch choſen and nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
through his violence. Witneſſe that dayly at ſet
houres there was in his chamber a Counſell holden of
matters propounded, alſo what ſhould be concluded
in the Eſtates by purchaſe, driftes or violence accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as the ſayd Duke of Guiſe and his partakers had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued,
euen in the face of the world, yea and he boaſted
of it, and that there was no greater ſafetie then in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
likewiſe that it was a poinct of treaſon, to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:12912:6"/>
be our faithfull ſeruant, giuing out as a badge of iniurie
this terme HE IS ROYALL, and for a badge of honor,
HE IS A GVISART. He ſought vniuſtly to command
ouer him, whom God had conſtituted in all authoritie,
&amp; ſoueraign power ouer him, &amp; endeuored by the meer
benefites, honors and authoritie, which his king had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
vpon him to take from him both crowne &amp; life,
at the leaſt ſo ſoone as he had founde meanes ſomewhat
better to eſtabliſh his authoritie then as yet it was, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture
he could haue graunted vs ſo long life: for it
is moſt certaine and ſufficiently verified that he had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
taken ſuch order for his drifts that he accompted him
ſelfe Maiſter of our Caſtle and perſon, yea he had vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſeaſed vpon the keyes, euen of our Chambers: The
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient weapons for the execution of his practiſe and
vnfit for any other warrelick exploict were found, albeit
his fauorers had vſed all meanes to conuey them away, ſo
to take away all notice thereof, and his men were round
about vs. The companies of our ordinaunces whom we
had ordeyned for the ſafetie of our ſelues, and our eſtates
were by him diſmiſſed, yea ſo farre did he proceede as by
his letters ſigned by himſelfe and ſealed, with his ſeale of
armes, the inhabitantes of Remorantine were exempted
from receauing a part of the Lord of Souurays companie
whom we had there ordeyned: as alſo he tooke them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his protection and ſafegarde, contrary to our letters
patentes vpon the partition, that we had made with him
ſelfe: expreſſely forbidding the generall Commiſſarie for
victuals, throughout our Realme, to take from them any
victuals, for the ſaid company or any other.</p>
            <p>Againe the more to ſhewe that he would no longer
depend vpon any other then him ſelfe, ſuch was his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
in the cloſet and preſence of the late Queene,
our moſt honorable Lady and good mother, and ſundry
other Princes and Lordes there preſent, as when the treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:12912:6"/>
of treaſons came to be propounded, to the ende to
be renewed and ſworne vnto in full aſſembly of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtats,
to aunſwere vs moſt impudently that he would not
doe any thing, neither would ſweare thereto: but that if
he tranſgreſſed we ſhould cauſe him to be puniſhed: and
yet all this notwithſtanding, together with diuers others
warninges of his driftes and dealinges, dayly giuen vs by
our good, faithfull and loyall ſubicts and ſeruaunts, we
paſſed ouer all theſe thinges quietly, as perſwading our
ſelues that our great patience and benefites, wherein we
ſpared not any one gratification that lay in our power,
to them and theirs, would mollifie the hardneſſe of their
hartes, and reduce them to their iuſt obedience due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, conſidering the fierceneſſe of Lyons, and other the
moſt wild beaſtes is commonly tamed by benefites: but
as the ambitious deſire to raigne is inſatiable and infinite,
and that he that offendeth doth neuer forgiue: ſo theſe
mens inſolencies daily increaſed, and by an expreſſe meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſaid D. of Aumalle ſent vs vve were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed
that himſelfe had bene preſent in perſon, but not
in will (ſaid he) in a counſell holden at Paris, wherein
it was reſolued that the Duke of Guiſe ſhould feaſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our perſon and bring vs to Paris, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
we would not vpon our firſt conſiderations haue
ſuch reſpect to this aduice as we ought: howbeit vpon
the view of him whom ſince the aforeſaid D. of Mayenne
ſent vnto vs, ſeeing alſo the terme ſo ſhort as there was
no ſafetie for vs, but in the preuention of the liues of thoſe
who ſought to take away ours, and to vſurpe our eſtate
and Crowne: we were forced to vſe and practiſe vpon
their perſons, not what through their treacherous felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
they deſerued, but according as the ſeaſon would
bear that which we ought, yet would not haue done.</p>
            <p>This was the recompence that they had prepared for
our gratifications and benefites, and is at this day proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:12912:7"/>
by theſe, who during their liues ſeemed to conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne
their counſels, and did themſelues giue vs vvarning of the
ſame, to the end (as we do finde by their workes) to reſerue
to themſelues, and to turne to their particular profit the
fruite of this ambitious drift of empire, according to this
ancient prouerbe. <hi>If equitie be violable, it is to be violated
for a Kingdome,</hi> and either we haue no iudgement, or
els by their actions we muſt beleeue as they nowe do
agree together to take from vs our life and crown, which
GOD hath giuen vs, ſo ſhortlie they would haue ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
it, or els fallen a debate among themſelues, who
ſhoulde emoy that which they ſeeke ſo vniuſtlie to v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpe,
in caſe they had any opportunitie to inuade it:
as hauing already vndertaken authoritie to diſpoſe, and
by letters patentes to determine of the gouernement of
out prouinces, and of the leueying and diſtributing of
our treaſure.</p>
            <p>But ſeing pacience ought to be limitted and reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
within certaine boundes, beyond the which it can
not be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable in a Prince that oweth the preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
