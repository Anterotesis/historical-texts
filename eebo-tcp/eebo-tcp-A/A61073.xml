            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Protection; by which, my Lord, I am emboldened to suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate your Graces favour; my At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt carrying with it these two Reasons to mitigate my Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption: First, that these my <hi>Eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations</hi> and <hi>Meditations</hi> being Divine, they pretend a Title to your Graces Cognizance; with whose most learned Name being presented to the world, they will undoubtedly sinde an Acceptance among Pious and Judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The other Reason is, That since your Grace was acquainted with my deceased Grand - father Mr. <hi>John Speed,</hi> the English Chronologer, and laborious Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealoger, the Author (and this his <hi>Enchiridion,</hi> he) humbly hopes may obtain your favourable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect:
<pb facs="tcp:99551:4"/>
For which causes, I am apt to promise to my self a fair Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, though they are the Issues of my Retirements in a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; since from the like place Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God by a Miracle did redeem St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and our Blessed Saviour deigned to love poor <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> though in a low conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: though I write from a Prison to the Palace of <hi>England</hi>'s renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Metropolitan, it is, however, to testifie the zeal I have for your Graces merits. May your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, as your hours, increase in this Age; may your glorious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory be admired in futurity: And when your Grace shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change your Terrest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <hi>LOndon</hi>'s too late and fatal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Plague and Fire, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made me uncapable to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage my Affairs with the like success as formerly, some Creditors, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere as well as covetous, forced me to a Confinement in <hi>Ludgate;</hi> where, the bet ter to employ my time, I have compiled and composed this Manual of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which consists of Psalms, Hymns, and Divine Poems: In which act of Contemplation, I made my Prison my Paradise, being so transported with Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that I banish'd from my memory all thoughts of my Affliction: And as I found great satisfaction in the writing, I hope the Reader will finde the like in
<pb facs="tcp:99551:6"/>
the perusal; for in it are variety of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, especially such as are extracted from the Psalms, that book which may properly be called the Heart of the Bible, and is therefore most fitly placed in the middle, as the Anatomy of the Soul, the Epitome of the Law, and the Expositor of the Gospel; the Register, Enchiridion, and Summary of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And as the writing thereof hath been delightful, so certainly in Confinement no pleasure can exceed a serious (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if Divine) Study; no Companions can be better than divine Books; nor can any time be better spent than in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative Devotion. Therefore since this life is as it were a Fair, and while the Fair lasteth there is to be bought in it any thing that is necessary; if we suffer the time of the Fair to slip away, it is in vain to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect another: Wherefore before the time be past, which the Lord of the Fair and the mercie of thy Maker hath allowed, be studious to perform Repentance, that thou mayst procure Pardon; be diligent to gain Grace, that thou mayst obtain Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99551:6"/>
It is reported of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, that when he came to besiege any place he caused a burning Light to be set up, and then made proclamation, that so long as the Light burned, he gave his Enemy time to seek for mercie by surrendring themselves and the place; but if within that time they did it not, the Sword should destroy them all. Now what is mans life but a burning Light? and so long as this Light continues, God gives us time to make our peace with him, and to provide for our future safety; but this Light being once extinguished before we draw neer to God, by Repentance and Conversion, those two fabricks of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what remains but a sudden and an eternal destruction? Therefore since we have filled God's bag with our sins, let us likewise fill his bottle with our tears.</p>
            <p>Wherefore when we waste our time, we ought not to complain for the want of time; but rather to follow the example of that holy St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> who (when he heard a Clock strike) would say, <hi>There's one hour more now past that I have to answer for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99551:7"/>
               <hi>Latimer</hi> rose usually at Two of the clock in the morning to his Study; and <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> slept not commonly above four hours in the night; and in his bed, till sleep came, his Book went not out of his hand. He counted that hour not well spent, wherein he did not some good, either with his Pen, his Study, or Discourse; these Worthies well weighing that truth which <hi>Seneca</hi> asserts: <hi>Time that is consumed idly, is rather spilt than spent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Contemplation is the life of the Soul, and the Christians best Companion in his solitude; but a contemplative life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out practice, is like unto <hi>Rachel, Jacob</hi>'s Wife, beautiful, bright-sighted, but barren. It is good therefore to have <hi>Rachel</hi>'s beautiful face to be seconded with <hi>Leahs</hi> fruitful womb. By Contemplation and Consideration, <hi>Solomon</hi> got much of his Wisdom, as appeareth by his <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> which by some is very aptly called <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's Soliloquy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Basil</hi> left his friends and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, retiring himself into a Wilderness, that he might the more devoutly serve God, and delight himself in holy Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
<pb facs="tcp:99551:7"/>
And St. <hi>Hierome</hi> comforting a young Hermit, bad him look up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and take a few turns in Paradise, by his Meditations; assuring him, that so long as he had Paradise in his minde, and Heaven in his thoughts, he should not be sensible of his Solitariness.</p>
            <p>Nor is Contemplation onely delightful, but also profitable, by taking the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion off from vain Imaginations, idle Company, profane Discourse, and obscene Songs; all which are too frequent in a Prison, and tend not onely to the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good Manners, but the ruine both of Precepts &amp; of Principles: for vain Songs are Songs sung to the World, lascivious Ballads are Songs sung to the Flesh, and Satyrical Libels are Songs sung to the Devil; onely Psalms, Hymns, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Songs, making melody in the heart, are Songs sung to the Lord.</p>
            <p>Spiritual Silence is a sweeter note than a loud (especially if lewd) Sonnet; and the advice of St. <hi>James</hi> is both divine and wholsome: <hi>Is any among you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted? let him pray: Is any merry? let him sing Psalms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99551:8"/>
I know it is a general humour in this Age, to think no Verse good but what is scurrilous and profane; nor do I promise Elegancy in my stile, that being more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for dramatick than divine Poesie. Nay, such is the looseness of this Age, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are of opinion, that Divinity in verse is unpleasant to the ear and to the heart: let such be convinced by the Psalms of <hi>David,</hi> or the Song of his son <hi>Solomon.</hi> Divine Verse hath these two operations: it is pleasant, and makes an impression in the memory of the Reader; so true is that of the excellent Mr. <hi>Geo. Herbert,</hi> Vniversity-Oratour of <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>A Verse may take him who a Sermon flies,</l>
               <l>And turn delight into a Sacrifice.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>As Affliction admits of Contemplation, so Prosperity swells the Heart: this <hi>Agur</hi> knew well, and therefore prayed for a Mediocrity. Some are of opinion, that <hi>Solomon's</hi> wealth did him much more hurt than his wisdom did him good. <hi>David's</hi> first ways were his best ways; neither was he ever so good and tender as
<pb facs="tcp:99551:8"/>
when he was hunted like a Partridge on the Mountains. Indeed of <hi>Vespatian</hi> it is storied, that he was made the better man by being made Emperour; but he was too rare a bird to have his fellow.</p>
            <p>Such is the incertainty of humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, that a full Estate discovers a man as well as doth a low and empty one: To know how to abound, is as high a part of Grace as to know how to want: God tries in a right-hand-way as well as in a left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand-way: Poverty endangers Grace much, but Riches more: To be great in the World, is a great temptation: it is a hard thing to carry a full Cup with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hand. Many when they grow rich in Temporals, wax poor in Spirituals: As their outward man increaseth, so their inward man decayeth; and as the flesh flourishes, the spirit withers: yet prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wickedness is accounted Vertue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dionysius,</hi> after the spoil of an Idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temple, finding the winds favourable in his Navigation, <hi>Lo,</hi> said he, <hi>how the Gods approve of Sacriledge:</hi> So divers because they are prosperous, are apt to believe themselves pious, and that God
<pb facs="tcp:99551:9"/>

            <p>OUnspeakable Creator, who from the treasure of thy Wisdom hast appointed three Hierarchies of Angels, and placed them by a wonderful Order above the Heaven; and hast most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably distributed the parts of the World. Thou, which art called the true Fountain of Light, of Wisdom, and the Highest Being; vouchsafe to pour down upon the darkness of my Understanding in the which I was born, the double Beam of thy Brightness, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving

from me Darkness, or the clouds of Sin and Ignorance. Thou which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest eloquent the Tongues of men, and givest the benefit of Utterance, instruct my Tongue, and pour into my Lips the grace of thy Blessing: Give me quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Understanding, capacity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, judgment in Interpreting, faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Learning, and copious Grace of Speaking: Guide my going in, direct my going forward, and accomplish my going forth: Teach me to instruct o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in thy fear, that they and I may sing Praises to thee and to the Lamb for evermore.</p>

            <head>A BRIEF Exhortation to Prayer,</head>
            <byline>Written by St. <hi>Chrysostome.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>IT is very meet and profitable that we employ the time of our life in Prayer, that thereby our hearts may continually receive the sweet dew of God's Grace; of which all persons have no less need, than Trees and Herbs have of refreshing waters: for they cannot bring forth fruit except the roots be comforted with moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture; and in like manner, it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for us to be replenished with beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful fruits of Piety, if our hearts be not refreshed by Prayer: for which cause we ought to forsake our beds, and prevent the Sun-rising in God's service.</p>
            <p>The like we ought to do when we go to meat, and at night when we take our rest; yea, it behoveth us at all times to offer some Ejaculation to God, to the end we
<pb facs="tcp:99551:11"/>
may continually retain him and his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in our mindes. Tell me, O my Soul, how canst thou behold the Sun, if thou dost not honour him that made thine eyes to behold that most beautiful Light? How canst thou go to the Table to eat, if thou dost not first honour him who giveth and furnisheth thee dayly with such great benefits? How canst thou trust thy self in a dark and dismal night, when discontents, dreadful dreams, and many dangers might assault thee, if thou dost not defend thy self by Prayer and holy Meditations, which are the watchful guards that allay and destroy the stratagems of wicked spirits that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually endeavour to surprize and to devour? but if they see thee furnish'd with Prayer or divine Cogitations, they presently retire, even as wicked theeves when they see the Sword towards them. Wherefore, put you on the Armour of God, that you may withstand the assaults of the Devil.</p>

            <p>O God of my fathers, and Lord of mercies, thou that hast made all things with thy Word, and didst or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain man through thy Wisdom, that he should have dominion over thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which thou hast made, and that he should order the World according to Holiness and Righteousness, and execute Judgment with an upright heart; give me Wisdom which is ever about thy Seat, and put me not out from among thy

Children: For I thy servant, and son of thy Handmaid, am but of a short time, and too weak for the understanding of thy Judgments and Laws. Although a man be never so perfect among the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, yet if thy Wisdom be not with him, he shall be of no value: O send her out therefore from thy Holy Heavens, and from the Throne of thy Majesty, that she may be with me, and labour with me, that I may know what is acceptable in thy sight: for she know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and understandeth all things; and she shall lead me soberly in my works, and preserve me in her power: So shall my works be acceptable by Christ our Lord; to whom, with the Father, and the Holy Ghost, be all Honour and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, World without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head>HOLY RULES FOR The Devout Christian.</head>
            <p>IF thou art learned, be also pious: for Learning sanctified, is an Ornament to Grace; but Learning corrupted, is an Advocate for the Devil.</p>
            <p>Call to minde, and oftentimes exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thy self, accounting thy thoughts, thy words, and deeds, especially after much business, discourses, pastime, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Silence is commendable in things that appertain not to thee; to the end thou mayest the better call to minde the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of a crucified Saviour.</p>
            <p>If God hath blessed thee with an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, relieve thy Brother; and so live as having little, yet possessing all things: For remember that Meat, Drink, and Cloath, are the Riches of a Christian;
<pb facs="tcp:99551:13"/>
and since Christ gave himself for thee, well may'st thou give some Fruits of thy labour unto his.</p>
            <p>Let Death be oftentimes the subject of thy Meditations; yield thy self wholly to God. If thou art poor, and hast nothing to requite him with but thy prayers and thy self, yet if thou givest thy self to his disposal, thou then givest all thou hast. The Apostles left their Ships and their Nets: The poor Widow gave only her two Mites to the poor mans box, and she was preferred before a wealthy <hi>Croesus.</hi> He easily despiseth all things of this world, that doth but remember he must die.</p>
            <p>In open Assemblies use not ordinarily all spiritual things, lest thou shalt be thought to be singular; except thou may'st edisie others, and by thy example stir them up to the like.</p>
            <p>On all occasions prefer the glory of God and his service above all things.</p>
            <p>Be a comfort to the Afflicted, reconcile Dissentions, visit the Sick and the Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, and forget not to relieve the Poor and needy: Above all things, have ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent love, for love shall cover a multitude of sins.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99551:13"/>
Fast one day in each month, or oftner if the strength of thy body will bear it; and remember to distribute thy Alms: for Fasting and Alms are the wings of Prayer.</p>
            <p>If perturbation or discontents arise in thy minde, apply thy self to Prayer. Go not to thy rest in wrath, lest thou givest the common enemy to mankinde an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to surprize thee.</p>
            <p>Beware of immoderate Cares, lest you dishonour or deny God: for such cares are

            <p>Repent dayly; let not the Devil have the Flour of thy age, and God the Bran.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of Prayer is far more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious than Treasures of Gold and Silver.</p>
            <p>Despise not the Ministers of Christ; for Christ is the Word, and they are his Embassadors.</p>
            <p>God requires we should mortisie our lusts; for Prayer, without that, is the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of a Hypocrite.</p>
            <p>Sin bringeth shame and sorrow; but Piety hath the portion of everlasting joys.</p>
            <p>Let us cloath our selves with Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; it is the safest Armour against the darts of Satan.</p>
            <p>The two Roads that lead to Heaven, are Innocence and Repentance.</p>
            <p>Sin is the Christians greatest sore, and Repentance his surest salve: who then would want the rare Jewel of Repentance? since, <hi>If ye seek, ye shall finde.</hi>

            <head>A MISCELANY OF Divine Maximes: OR, Words fitly spoken, <hi>Like Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. WOuldst thou be truly perfect? love God with all thy heart, and thy Neighbour as thy self.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let thy eye be always upon God and thy self, and thou shalt never see him without good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, nor thy self without misery.</p>
            <p n="3">3. None shall see God so much as he is visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and none shall ever love God so much as he is amiable.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He that doth not covet to love God more and more, can never love him enough.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To whom God is all, the World ought to be nothing at all.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Let us be what God will, so we be but his; and let us not be what we will our selves, against the will of God.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In the service of God, there is nothing little enough to be rejected.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To meditate much upon God is good, but the Souls greater advancement in Vertue, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in much loving him.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb facs="tcp:99551:19"/>
9. He to whom God alone is pleasing, is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with nothing, but that which displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God.</p>
            <p n="10">10. In Divine matters a generous Soul finds greatest contentment, in believing things most difficult.</p>
            <p n="11">11. All our actions take their value from their conformity to the Will of God.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Love and Suffering are the greatest du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we owe to God, they being the two causes for which he died for us.</p>
            <p n="13">13. He that neglects his own will, complies best with God's.</p>
            <p n="14">14. So love thy Neighbour upon Earth, as that thou mayst enjoy his love in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Thou canst not love thy Neighbour too much, but thou mayst too much shew thy love.</p>
            <p n="16">16. One great argument of our love to our Neighbour, is to bear with his imperfections.</p>
            <p n="17">17. We should never endure to hear evil spoken of any but our selves.</p>
            <p n="18">18. We should never under value any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; the workman loves not that his work should be despised in his presence: wherefore beware, for God is present every where, and and every person is his work.</p>
            <p n="19">19. It is a spiritual injustice to desire to know the secrets of others, and to conceal our own</p>
            <p n="20">20. We ought not to love our Neighbour onely because he is good, or because we hope he
<pb facs="tcp:99551:20"/>
will be so, but because God commands us so to do.</p>
            <p n="21">21. In holy duties we should speak little, think much, but do more.</p>
            <p n="22">22. It is a great evil not to do good.</p>
            <p n="23">23. The just man never dies unprepared: for he is well prepared for death, who perseveres in Christian justice to the end.</p>
            <p n="24">24. Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble, is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joynt.</p>
            <p n="25">25. As he that taketh away a Garment in cold weather, and as Vinegar upon Nitre, so is he that singeth Songs to a heavy heart.</p>
            <p n="26">26. It is no shame to be poor: Nature brought us so into the World, and so we must return.</p>
            <p n="27">27. Dost thou want things necessary? grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not, perchance it was necessary thou shouldest want; however, seek a lawful remedy; if God bless not thy endeavour, do thou bless him that knoweth what is fittest for thee: Thou art God's Patient, prescribe not thy Physician.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Art thou calumniated? examine thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; if that be spotted, thou hast a just cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; if not guilty, thou hast a fair instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Use both, so shalt thou distil honey out of gall, and make to thy self a secret friend of an open enemy.</p>
            <p n="29">29. If thine enemy be hungry give him bread, if thirsty give him drink; thou thereby heapest coals of fire upon his head, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward unto thy self.</p>
            <p n="30">
               <pb facs="tcp:99551:20"/>
30. Charity makes God our debtor; for the Poor are his receivers.</p>
            <p n="31">31. Hast thou an Estate, and wouldst increase it? divide thy Riches to the Poor; those Seeds that are scattered do encrease, but hoarded up they die.</p>
            <p n="32">32. Correction without instruction, makes the Master a Tyrant, and the Servant a novice.</p>
            <p n="33">33. That man is a Conquerour that can sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due his own passions.</p>
            <p n="34">34. Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.</p>
            <p n="35">35. Arm thy self against a profest enemy; but he that dissembleth friendship strikes beyond a caution, and wounds above a cure: from the one thou mayst deliver thy self, but from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Good Lord deliver thee.</p>
            <p n="36">36. A man that flattereth his Neighbour, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eadeth a Net for his feet.</p>
            <p n="37">37. The Touch-stone trieth Gold, and Gold trieth men.</p>
            <p n="38">38. Virtue must be the guide of all Qualities, otherwise the Professors are undone.</p>
            <p n="39">39. As the servants of God are known by their two Vertues, Humility and Charity, so the servants of the Devil are known by their opposite Vices, Pride and Cruelty.</p>
            <p n="40">40. The best way to keep good acts in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, is to refresh them with new.</p>
            <p n="41">41. To boast is to be vain, since the greatest Conquerour, if he measure his own shadow,
<pb facs="tcp:99551:21"/>
shall finde it no longer than it was before his victory.</p>
            <p n="42">42. Believe not Soothsayers: for Prophesies are never understood till they are accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</p>
            <p n="43">43. The World is a wide Prison, and every day an execution-day.</p>
            <p n="44">44. Our Stomachs are common Sepulchres for Birds, Beasts, and Fish; they all die to feed us: Lord, with how many deaths are our poor lives patched up! How full of death is the life of man!</p>
            <p n="45">45. Beware of Drink: where Drunkenness reigns, Reason is an exile, Vertue a stranger, and God an enemy; Blasphemy is Wit, Oaths are Rhetorick, and Secrets are Proclamations.</p>
            <p n="46">46. Whosoever will arrive at a New life, must pass by the death of the Old.</p>
            <p n="47">47. He that is truly humble, never thinks himself wronged.</p>
            <p n="48">48. The good man lives contented with a moderate Estate, not so much taking notice of those that have more, as those that have less than our selves.</p>
            <p n="49">49. He that most mortifies natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, receives most supernatural inspirations.</p>
            <p n="50">50. To shun the accidental troubles of this life, is to meditate often upon Eternity.</p>
            <p n="51">51. It is the great misfortune of man, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire those things which he should only use.</p>
            <p n="52">52. To have a desire to be poor, and not to
<pb facs="tcp:99551:21"/>
receive the inconveniencies of it, is too great ambition: For it is to desire the honour of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and the commodity of Wealth.</p>
            <p n="53">53. There is no better way to end happily a true spiritual life, than daily to begin it.</p>
            <p n="54">54. He that would have a part with Jesus glorified, must first take part with Jesus cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p n="55">55. We should live in this present World as if our Souls were in Heaven and our Bodies in the Grave.</p>
            <p n="56">56. In the death of our Passions consists the life of our Souls.</p>
            <p n="57">57. It is not Humility to acknowledge our selves miserable, that onely is not to be a beast; but it is Humility to desire that others should e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem us so.</p>
            <p n="58">58. There is no reason to be given for the fault we commit in sin; for the fault would not be sin, if it were not against Reason.</p>
            <p n="59">59. Virtues never have their full growth, but when they bring forth desires of advancing; which like spiritual seeds, serve to produce new degrees of Vertues.</p>
            <p n="60">60. We should never speak of God, or of things which concern his service, carelesly, by way of discourse, or entertainment, but always with great respect and humble minde.</p>
            <p n="61">61. We should sear the Judgement of God without discouragement, and encourage our selves without presumption.</p>
            <p n="62">
               <pb facs="tcp:99551:22"/>
62. The ready way for the Soul to have peace with it self, is to obtain its peace with God.</p>
            <p n="63">63. We may perform many holy actions, yet not please God, if we neglect to do what he requires of us, no more than a Painter in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting an Eagle, pleaseth him that desired a Bee.</p>
            <p n="64">64. Let us never look on our Crosses but through the Cross of Christ; thereby we shall finde them pleasant, and have fresh desires to be afflicted.</p>
            <p n="65">65. Desire to obtain the love of God, makes us meditate; but that love once obtained, makes us contemplate.</p>

               <l>FOrbear, vain Muse, thy subject is too high;</l>
               <l>Thy Saveraign rather, is the Deity;</l>
               <l>The God of all the World, whose dreadful Name</l>
               <l>Strikes an Amazement in whole Natures frame.</l>
               <l>God! what a fright the very sound hath made!</l>
               <l>My Soul into a Ravishment is laid.</l>
               <l>I must repent my rashness; when that's done,</l>

               <l>Nay, of a Quire of Angels blest, who bring</l>
               <l>Joy to themselves, and Duty to their King.</l>
               <l>Then since thy Task is great, thy Work sublime,</l>
               <l>Invoke <hi>Apollo</hi> to assist thy Rhyme;</l>
               <l>Call the nine Muses to inspire thy heart,</l>
               <l>That every one with thee may bear a part:</l>
               <l>So to preserve your duties from decay,</l>
               <l>Striving to Love, to Sing, and to Obey.</l>
               <l>'Tis not an easie or a common thing,</l>
               <l>For Peasants to approach an Earthly King;</l>
               <l>Then how much study is to be acquir'd,</l>

                  <l>But heav'nly Wisdom doth the World outlast.</l>
                  <l>If earthly Riches, they have wings and fly;</l>

How the Spectators look, and seem to say,</l>
                  <l>There's too much store provided for one day:</l>
                  <l>How many wretched Souls do beg for Bread,</l>
                  <l>Whilst this same Glutton hath his Table spread</l>
                  <l>With all varieties? And thus they show</l>
                  <l>Their envy: But alas, did they but know,</l>
                  <l>And well consider what his wants are, then</l>
                  <l>They'd pity him, as if the worst of men.</l>
                  <l>His Talent's rich: on earth there's none above it;</l>
                  <l>But he wants Grace and Wisdom to improve it.</l>
                  <l>All his Estate is but a mighty spoil;</l>
                  <l>He hath a Lamp, but that Lamp hath no Oyl.</l>
                  <l>He hath a Soul, but what doth that embrace?</l>
                  <l>Vain worldly Lusts; the opposites to Grace.</l>
                  <l>His House shines gloriously; but when all's done,</l>
                  <l>He hath the Star-light, but he wants the Sun.</l>
                  <l>A Friend to Vice, and Vertue's mortal hater;</l>
                  <l>Having the Creature, but not the Creator.</l>
                  <l>This world's a Torrent of false Joys; the boat</l>
                  <l>Is his vain life, doth on it dayly float.</l>
                  <l>His Silver Anchor is as weak as Sand;</l>
                  <l>Nor can his Gold conduct him safe to Land,</l>
                  <l>But rather sink him to the Misers Cell,</l>
                  <l>There to inhabit where damn'd Spirits dwell.</l>
                  <l>Can he be worth your envy then? forbear,</l>
                  <l>Rather in pity shed a Christian tear.</l>
                  <l>If he be happy, May it be thy will,</l>
                  <l>O Lord, that I be miserable still.</l>
                  <l>Give me thy Grace, although I'm clad in Rags;</l>

                  <l>IN midst of Mirth there sadness is,</l>
                  <l>And so in Grief there's joy;</l>
                  <l>Whilst wealthy sinners faces smile,</l>
                  <l>Their hearts do feel annoy.</l>
                  <l>Carnal delights they are but vam,</l>
                  <l>And bring vexations too;</l>
                  <l>They sound like musick in a strain,</l>
                  <l>Whose discord ends in rue.</l>
                  <l>Thus to the Sensualist they play,</l>
                  <l>Left he prove dull and sad;</l>
                  <l>But when the Reckoning comes to pay,</l>
                  <l>It makes him downright mad.</l>

                  <l>In laughter there is grief;</l>
                  <l>The end of mirth is heaviness,</l>
                  <l>And Hell the salse relief.</l>
                  <l>But he that's truly penitent,</l>
                  <l>And doth his Tears impart,</l>
                  <l>They are to Angels straightway sent,</l>
                  <l>Rejoycing his own heart.</l>
                  <l>They are the solace of his Soul;</l>
                  <l>If bitter they appear,</l>

                  <l>Then aims at Baron, as his Title-right.</l>

The Duke no arguments can him convince,</l>

                  <l>After his many wonders, even then</l>
                  <l>He sound himself to be as other men.</l>
                  <l>Base Pride eclipses those of high degree;</l>
                  <l>But before Honour is Humility:</l>

                  <l>Making men act things but profusely good.</l>
                  <l>Swelling Ambition makes a man its slave</l>

                  <l>And nothing more uncertain than when breath</l>

                  <l>Death sends no Summons, but comes unaware.</l>
                  <l>The grand decry is past; dispute not why</l>
                  <l>All men have sinned, and all men must die.</l>
                  <l>Man's days are numbred, he can finde no aid;</l>
                  <l>'Tis God hath man upon the balance laid,</l>
                  <l>And found him wanting. God's all-searching eye</l>
                  <l>Hath thus determin'd, men are Vanity.</l>
                  <l>Corruption is man's father, and the Worms</l>
                  <l>His sisters, they have their corrupt conforms.</l>
                  <l>The Grave it is his Bed, the Sheet his Shrine,</l>
                  <l>The Earth his Cover, Grass his Carpet fine.</l>
                  <l>At last Death comes, and he concludes the Theam,</l>
                  <l>Finds man asleep, and darts him in his Dream.</l>
                  <l>Such is our sluggish life, a shadow, frail,</l>
                  <l>A bubble, vapour, and a trifling tale:</l>
                  <l>So vain a story, that when we grow old</l>
                  <l>We spend our days before the tale is told.</l>

                  <l>Refines us, that we may prove cleer at last.</l>
                  <l>What is corrupt, within the grave must lie,</l>

                     <hi>Till</hi> Mortal puts on Immortality.</l>

The time we have to live, it is but small,</l>

                  <l>This world, to cheat us of a world more rare.</l>
                  <l>Our pleasures do deceitfully entangle,</l>
                  <l>Smiling ev'n then, when they intend to strangle.</l>
                  <l>The world is kindest when it most doth frown,</l>
                  <l>And honours list us up to cast us down.</l>
                  <l>The Christian then should ready be to cry,</l>
                  <l>When God shall call, <hi>Behold, Lord, here am I.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>For they of their Salvation never mist,</l>
                  <l>Have been partakers of the death of Christ.</l>
                  <l>God on the Righteous alway hath an eye;</l>
                  <l>His ear is ever open to their cry:</l>
                  <l>And he that doth a righteous man regard,</l>
                  <l>He shall receive a righteous man's reward.</l>
                  <l>Be truly zealous, shew no vain pretext,</l>

               <head>¶ On Shame.</head>
               <lg>
                  <l>THe age is impudent in which we live;</l>
                  <l>Men seem asham'd to be asham'd of blame;</l>
                  <l>And to their Errours such a licence give,</l>
                  <l>That they delight to glory in their shame.</l>
                  <l>They have a specious Cloak for each offence,</l>
                  <l>And study how to palliate their Vice.</l>
                  <l>The Covetous hath Husbandry's pretence;</l>
                  <l>The Prodigal is free, perhaps at Dice.</l>
                  <l>The Lecher shrouds his sin i'th' mask of Love;</l>
                  <l>The Drunkard to good fellowship pretends;</l>
                  <l>The Cheat doth for his Family improve</l>
                  <l>Ill-gotten goods; each have their private ends.</l>
                  <l>They blush not at the fact, yet will not own</l>
                  <l>The Title; by the which we may conclude</l>
                  <l>The sense of shame, when to perfection grown,</l>
                  <l>Restrains from sins, can hide a multitude.</l>

But he that is this apprehension past,</l>
                  <l>Lets loose the Reins of his suborned will,</l>
                  <l>Goes hand in hand with Satan, till at last</l>
                  <l>Madness and Mischief are his joy and skill.</l>
                  <l>The World says to him, Take thy pleasure, swim</l>
                  <l>In Lust and Liquor: Heart, the Minde, and Eye</l>
                  <l>Are lively, merry, careless, and so trim,</l>
                  <l>He doth not care though God's his enemie.</l>
                  <l>Fools shew their folly as it sutes their name,</l>
                  <l>But prudent men will be asham'd of Shame.</l>

               <head>¶ On the Wilful Impenitent.</head>
               <lg>
                  <l>TEll me, fond Worldling, why dost thou deride</l>
                  <l>A godly Christian? Is't thy natures pride?</l>
                  <l>Dost thou not dayly see his weeping eye</l>
                  <l>Shed Tears to wake thy sleeping Lethargie?</l>
                  <l>See how he trembles at the sight of sin!</l>
                  <l>Whilst thou, lewd actor, longest to begin;</l>
                  <l>And look'st on him as pusillanimous,</l>
                  <l>A Coward, or a Drone. I tell thee, thus</l>
                  <l>Thou'rt rashly valiant, and dost spend thy breath</l>
                  <l>On Toys, whilst he dare boldly look on Death.</l>
                  <l>He's truly noble; and when he appears,</l>
                  <l>Is not appall'd before the King of Fears.</l>
                  <l>Heav'n is his harbour, Grace doth most delight him;</l>
                  <l>Hell's horrours may appear, but not affright him:</l>
                  <l>But as a Conqueror over Death and Hell,</l>
                  <l>Can with his Smiles all their Bravadoes quell;</l>
                  <l>And with a chearful heart this Ditty sing,</l>
                  <l>As if in scorn, <hi>O, Death, where is thy sting?</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Or like a Cherubim that flies on high,</l>
                  <l>Can say, <hi>O, Hell, where is thy victory?</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>This is the Valediction of a Saint,</l>
                  <l>Whilst Sinners toyl, and in their labours faint.</l>
                  <l>Where is the Worldling's glory? He can sin,</l>
                  <l>Can vitious be, and he can boast therein:</l>

Can silence Conscience, and outface a Crime,</l>
                  <l>And shun a blush to damn his Soul betime.</l>
                  <l>That man a Coward is, and fights by stealth;</l>
                  <l>For if a sickness doth impair his health,</l>
                  <l>He then believes Death doth a summons beat,</l>
                  <l>And his large Spirit sneaks to a retreat.</l>
                  <l>Doth he not tremble when he once hath got</l>
                  <l>A shaking Ague, or a Feaver hot?</l>
                  <l>And when he feels the heavy hand of Fate,</l>
                  <l>He begs for quarter, though it be too late.</l>
                  <l>What heaviness then fits upon his look?</l>
                  <l>Terrour appears, Conscience unfolds its book,</l>
                  <l>Charges him to consider well and read;</l>
                  <l>And just as he begins, Death strikes him dead.</l>
                  <l>A true Repentance cannot be too late;</l>
                  <l>Early Repentance is a blessed state.</l>
                  <l>Thus doth a sinner to Perdition fall,</l>
                  <l>And that which was his Throne, becomes his Thrall.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>ALl lusts reduced are to Three-fold heads,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Lust of the eyes, the flesh,</hi> and that which leads</l>
                  <l>To as much Vice and a continual Strife,</l>
                  <l>The haughty humour, or <hi>the pride of life.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>But Envy is the chiefest lust of eyes;</l>
                  <l>Seeing another good, with him it vies,</l>
                  <l>Not to be farther good; his envy grew,</l>
                  <l>Seeing good men belov'd and honour'd too.</l>
                  <l>Envy thinks all men made of equal stuff:</l>
                  <l>Why may not envious men be good enough?</l>
                  <l>It for the Innocent defends a Cause</l>
                  <l>To seem a Saint, and to procure applause:</l>
                  <l>But 'tis a Plague within a man's own brest,</l>
                  <l>And a Disease will not admit of Rest.</l>
                  <l>If such a thing as Admiration be,</l>

                  <l>Sometimes breaks forth to shake the Universe.</l>
                  <l>A sharp Malignity, most quick of sight;</l>

                  <l>Yet keep at distance, of his wiles beware:</l>

                  <l>When hungry grown, doth eat its fellows dung.</l>
                  <l>Whilst Envy doth obliquely look upon</l>
                  <l>The good of others, all his own is gone:</l>
                  <l>Or at the least takes no delight; the smart</l>
                  <l>Is like a Vulture seeding on the heart.</l>

                  <l>And proves at last a man's Self-murtherer.</l>
                  <l>'Tis Couzen-German to the sin of Pride,</l>
                  <l>And each may well be call'd a Homicide.</l>
                  <l>Wrath kills the foolish man, when in his way</l>
                  <l>The envious man the silly Soul doth slay.</l>
                  <l>The eye, alas, is the unhappy pit</l>
                  <l>That first doth this destructive guest admit:</l>
                  <l>And when it gets a full possession once,</l>
                  <l>It shrinks the Nerves, and rots into the bones:</l>
                  <l>Till with Consumption it doth man environ,</l>
                  <l>Feeding on him as Rust doth seed on Iron.</l>
                  <l>Envy believes its will should be its law:</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Socrates</hi> saith, 'Tis to the Soul a Saw;</l>
                  <l>Grates without mercy when it doth behold</l>
                  <l>Its dross, and sees another shine in gold.</l>
                  <l>Like the poor Fly, to put the Candle out,</l>
                  <l>Doth burn it self with buzzing round about.</l>

                  <l>Leaping on him, is cast into the fire.</l>
                  <l>Envy's a Canker in the Heart and Minde,</l>

Some skilful Mariner to shew his art,</l>

                  <l>So every morning when we rise from rest,</l>
                  <l>Our hearts should study for a just Request:</l>

                  <l>Through Rivers of our Tears we ought to swim:</l>

                  <l>Irreconcilable is Enmity:</l>
                  <l>It is a mutual Malevo'ence,</l>
                  <l>'That between parties studies for offence.</l>
                  <l>A dire antipathy that doth create</l>
                  <l>The killing Canker of a mortal hate.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Magirus</hi> saith, Nature makes it appear</l>
                  <l>In divers Creatures, namely Horse and Bear,</l>
                  <l>The Eagle and the Swan, among all Fowl,</l>
                  <l>The lesser sort of Birds oppose the Owl.</l>
                  <l>The Toad and Spider likewise do agree</l>
                  <l>Each one to poyson by antipathy.</l>
                  <l>The stately Lion of couragious stock,</l>
                  <l>Though bold and fierce, is fearful of a Cock.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>THis precious Jewel, Knowledge, may compare</l>
                  <l>To those the <hi>Israelites</hi> of old did wear:</l>
                  <l>For if our Knowledge be improv'd but half</l>
                  <l>Of that, I ke them we but erect a Calf.</l>
                  <l>Their Gold was precious, all that while commodious;</l>
                  <l>But in an Idol cast, it then grew odious.</l>
                  <l>So the pure Wit of man, well understood,</l>
                  <l>Was in the days of Innocencie good;</l>
                  <l>But when corruption seizes on his age,</l>
                  <l>He becomes vicious that before was sage.</l>
                  <l>Or it resembles an untilled field</l>
                  <l>That barren lies, and nothing else doth yield</l>
                  <l>But Brambles, Thorns, unnecessary Weeds,</l>
                  <l>Till Grace manures it with its growing seeds.</l>
                  <l>The best of Minerals their poysons have</l>

                  <l>So the best Wits have folly, until Grace</l>

                  <l>Dare oppose dangers, feareth no controul.</l>

                  <l>It is the gift of God, and he alone</l>
                  <l>Can Wisdom fix within a heart of stone.</l>

                  <l>To Appreher sive Knowledge must conjoyn</l>
                  <l>Affective Knowledge: if those two combine,</l>
                  <l>They give a Christian courage. No retreat</l>
                  <l>Is needful when a Saint is arm'd compleat.</l>
                  <l>When as God's holy Spirit takes in hand</l>
                  <l>To teach, the Scholar soon doth understand.</l>
                  <l>To a good Soul nothing's of higher prize</l>
                  <l>Than is the knowledge of deep mysteries.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Austin</hi> of God desir'd no worldly pelf,</l>
                  <l>But only to know God, and know himself.</l>
                  <l>Knowledge and Love must both accord, for why?</l>
                  <l>Knowledge puffs up, but Love doth edifie.</l>
                  <l>Foolish were they that Knowledge did despise</l>
                  <l>Because it puffeth up: Rather than wise,</l>

                  <l>All things are excellent; but when he finds</l>

                  <l>His eyes are full of his continual want,</l>
                  <l>Sees others worth, and grieves himself is scant.</l>
                  <l>When he hath but a mite of his deserts,</l>

                  <l>His generosity to famous use,</l>
                  <l>Whilst others do repay him with abuse.</l>
                  <l>From pride and malice none is more exempt;</l>

Violet-like, he grows low to the ground,</l>

                  <l>In his Discourse he never flies aloft;</l>
                  <l>His words are few, and those few words are soft.</l>
                  <l>Modestly speaking, not self-glorious,</l>
                  <l>Nor peremptory, nor censorious.</l>
                  <l>Because he thinks all other men more wise,</l>
                  <l>Corrects himself by his own modest eyes.</l>
                  <l>When his Devotions do the time beguile,</l>

                  <l>He hates none but himself, because not good.</l>
                  <l>A mite of Comfort doth his wants supply;</l>
                  <l>And none more patient when in misery,</l>
                  <l>Because he knows that his deserts are such,</l>
                  <l>That having sin'd, cannot be plagu'd too much.</l>
                  <l>He a low Valley is, and planted sweet,</l>
                  <l>Where fresh and fragrant Odours often meet;</l>
                  <l>And like the proud mans earth is trampled on,</l>
                  <l>Though full of wealthy Mines; a pretious stone</l>
                  <l>Fit for foundation-work, not plac'd aloof,</l>
                  <l>God's holy Temple built with lowly roof.</l>
                  <l>Camomile-like, and Palm-tree, when deprest,</l>

                     <hi>Zacheus</hi> from the Sycamore came down,</l>
                  <l>And that descension made the Lord his own.</l>
                  <l>'Tis not the Proud that do in Christ believe,</l>
                  <l>Not Lofty, but the Humble him receive.</l>
                  <l>Fruitfullest Trees do in the Valleys grow,</l>
                  <l>And thrive the better for their being low:</l>
                  <l>When taller Trees an interruption finde,</l>
                  <l>By the strong blast of a contagious winde:</l>
                  <l>Yet the tall Tree hangs down its head, to say,</l>
                  <l>For this God made me, and I do obey.</l>
                  <l>The humble man considers Earth's his Womb,</l>
                  <l>And then remembers Earth must be his Tomb.</l>
                  <l>Unto Humility God's Grace is given,</l>

                  <l>WHen on a Journey, and am weary grown,</l>
                  <l>I finde an Inne within some Countty-town,</l>
                  <l>And have observ'd, numbers of Guests do come</l>
                  <l>First to the Chamberlain to shew a Room;</l>
                  <l>Perhaps one Chamber doth contain them all,</l>
                  <l>Yet on the Chamberlain doth each man call:</l>
                  <l>One to the Table bids him straight attend,</l>
                  <l>Another doth him to the Window send,</l>
                  <l>A third unto the Chimney must be led,</l>
                  <l>A fourth would be conducted to his bed,</l>
                  <l>A fifth man sends him down for Glass or Cup,</l>
                  <l>And e're he's down, another calls him up.</l>
                  <l>Thus he's distracted with a sudden moyl,</l>
                  <l>Scarce can please all, though tired with his toyl.</l>
                  <l>Such is the sad condition of my Soul;</l>
                  <l>In what a cloud of crosses it doth rowl!</l>
                  <l>By Nature I am born a wretched twin;</l>
                  <l>To sorrow servant, and a slave to fin.</l>
                  <l>Unto the Window I am call'd by Pride,</l>
                  <l>Gluttony next pretends to be my Guide.</l>
                  <l>By Laziness I'm to the Chimney led,</l>
                  <l>By Wantonness I'm finely brought to bed.</l>
                  <l>Ambition calls me up, but I am grown</l>
                  <l>So coverous, more profit calls me down.</l>
                  <l>Vices, I see, themselves do contradict;</l>
                  <l>'Tis only Vertue that doth Vice convict.</l>

                     <hi>But</hi> The commandments of the Lord are pure.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>IN all things an immoderated use</l>
                  <l>Breeds a distate; and man, when grown prosuse,</l>
                  <l>Doth glut himself with Pleasure: He that's wise</l>
                  <l>Esteems them chiefly for their novelties.</l>
                  <l>The pleasure of the body gives relief</l>
                  <l>No otherwise than adding grief to grief.</l>
                  <l>When <hi>Jupiter</hi> (as ancient Poets fain)</l>
                  <l>With all his might and art could not attain</l>
                  <l>Two great Antagonists to reconcile,</l>
                  <l>Pleasure and Sorrow, having paus'd a while</l>

                  <l>As fixt Companions: They that were unstable</l>
                  <l>But just before, were made inseparable.</l>
                  <l>Affection propagates our Pleasures growth;</l>
                  <l>Vertue's an Antidote against them both.</l>

                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:99551:54"/>
Pleasure is the Adulterate brat of Sense,</l>
                  <l>So very fading, she cannot dispence</l>
                  <l>To last while Artists shall her Picture frame,</l>
                  <l>And therefore Memory preserves her name.</l>
                  <l>All those delights that do the Senses please,</l>
                  <l>Are one days age, an <hi>Ephemerides.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>What excellence may that be said to be,</l>
                  <l>Which the most excellent (as dangers) slee?</l>
                  <l>Time with the Pleasures of this World is spilt,</l>
                  <l>Full of the stain of fin, and sting of guilt.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Hannibal</hi> his honour lost, and duty,</l>
                  <l>Being entangled with a womans beauty.</l>

                  <l>Effects of Lust did like a Cloud o'recast</l>
                  <l>All their Archievements, and their labours blast.</l>
                  <l>Lust is the bane of Kingdoms: done alone,</l>
                  <l>It would more common be than any one</l>
                  <l>Of all those Vices that corrupt the eye;</l>
                  <l>Heathens the first place give to Piety.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Trismegistus</hi> this assertion brings,</l>
                  <l>Religion is the ground of publick things.</l>
                  <l>God did not cast man out of Paradise,</l>
                  <l>That man might make another by advice.</l>
                  <l>Be therefore wary, during time and leisure,</l>
                  <l>'Tis dangerous to take delight in Pleasure:</l>
                  <l>For 'tis a <hi>Syren</hi> doth deceive us all;</l>
                  <l>It gives us dainties, but they're mix'd with gall.</l>
                  <l>The Pitch and Tar of Sin so close do cleave,</l>
                  <l>That Pleasure waiteth only to deceive.</l>
                  <l>Riches seem pleasant things to banish Care,</l>
                  <l>But are at best but an intangling Snare.</l>
                  <l>Our Meat and Drink, when taken with excess,</l>
                  <l>Breaks forth to Surfeitings and Drunkenness.</l>
                  <l>Silver and Gold seem pleasant things, yet they,</l>
                  <l>Like thieves, from God do steal our hearts away.</l>
                  <l>That man that loveth pleasure shall he poor;</l>
                  <l>But God's right hand hath pleasures ever more.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>AS I in haste did through a Chamber pass,</l>
                  <l>I had almost destroy'd a Christal Glass.</l>
                  <l>With fear affrighted, I too soon believ'd</l>
                  <l>That I had broke it; thereupon I griev'd.</l>
                  <l>But how much time more pretious than that sand</l>
                  <l>Have I neglected? and with ready hand</l>
                  <l>Pursu'd my solly, being round beset</l>
                  <l>With sins, yet I not thinking of regret.</l>
                  <l>Though that but Christal, I my self condemn,</l>
                  <l>But minde not Time, though every hour's a gem.</l>
                  <l>The thought of breaking that did me affright;</l>
                  <l>The other's minded not, though lost outright.</l>
                  <l>That were but casual, if it had been done;</l>
                  <l>But with consent my pretious Time hath flown.</l>
                  <l>A better Hour glass may be had for cost,</l>
                  <l>But Time ill-spent is once and ever lost:</l>
                  <l>For toys our griess can finde a certain leisure,</l>
                  <l>But have no vent for an unvalued treasure.</l>
                  <l>Lord, let that Hour-glass for its service win me,</l>
                  <l>(Not that stands by me, but) shall be within me,</l>
                  <l>Teach me to number so my days, that I,</l>

                  <l>Be said to be an attribute of man.</l>

                  <l>The Flesh and Spirit do maintain a War</l>
                  <l>Against each other: man may make his moan,</l>
                  <l>He perfect is in Imperfection.</l>
                  <l>None but the Lord that Badge of Honour wears;</l>
                  <l>But man may gain it with his Prayers and Tears;</l>
                  <l>Cannot enjoy it here, but he must fly</l>
                  <l>Where it is crowned with Felicity.</l>
                  <l>They are Coelestial plants or flowers, both</l>

                  <l>In Scripture as <hi>Apollos,</hi> we indent</l>
                  <l>Too far with Sin and Satan, that our care</l>
                  <l>Hath no perfection, but a perfect snare.</l>

                  <l>None perfect are, nor <hi>none good, no not one.</hi>

                  <l>
                     <hi>David</hi> was tainted with two horrid sins,</l>
                  <l>Murther, Adultery, as if two twins</l>

                  <l>Sends me the stoutest he,</l>
                  <l>And, Champion-like, commands the heart</l>
                  <l>to stay.</l>
                  <l>Then be he Rich, or be he Poor,</l>
                  <l>A Spark, or else a Clown,</l>
                  <l>They lie together on the floor,</l>
                  <l>and so</l>
                  <l>They sleep as if they lay upon</l>
                  <l>The softest Bed of Down.</l>
                  <l>Troubles are fled, and Griefs are gone:</l>
                  <l>for though</l>
                  <l>The Body naked in the cold Earth lies,</l>
                  <l>The Soul sings Hallelujahs 'bove the Skies.</l>

                  <l>We are not with it born;</l>
                  <l>None of themselves repentantly can cry,</l>
                  <l>Or make the World his scorn.</l>
                  <l>They're carnal Christians think it is enough</l>
                  <l>To mingle <hi>Lord have mercy</hi> with their stuff.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>We Jewels buy, and they prove counterfeit,</l>
                  <l>So man himself undoes.</l>
                  <l>Thus in Repentance Souls themselves do cheat,</l>
                  <l>And their rich Jewel loose.</l>
                  <l>Which made one say, Repentance would not lin,</l>
                  <l>Until it damned many more than sin.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>If we repent for sin, 'tis nothing worth,</l>
                  <l>Unless we do refrain</l>
                  <l>From it as well: for if we from our birth</l>

                  <l>GReatness is with a strong desire affected,</l>

                  <l>While Goodness walks below with humble pace:</l>
                  <l>The first is follow'd with an Eagle's eye,</l>
                  <l>The last is thought unworthy of the Chace.</l>

                  <l>And Goodness aims at Grace, which leads to Glory.</l>

                  <l>I came from thence to sing his praise.</l>

                  <l>But Beauty was his only snare.</l>

                  <l>And safely brought away his head.</l>

                  <l>TEars! the sweet Musick of harmonious Souls;</l>
                  <l>Angels rejoyce, and ready are in shouls</l>
                  <l>To dance thereto; it is their heav'nly skill,</l>
                  <l>Their Master's bottle, with such pearls to fill:</l>
                  <l>And when the Soul in Sin's consumption lies,</l>
                  <l>No Balsam's better than the briny eyes.</l>
                  <l>God loves not waters of a common ford;</l>
                  <l>All Rivers are not pleasing to the Lord.</l>

When <hi>Esau</hi> wept, it was to think upon</l>
                  <l>His Brothers fraud; with indignation</l>
                  <l>His Tears were mix'd, his whispring thoughts within,</l>
                  <l>Cry'd, 'Tis my loss I prize beyond my sin.</l>
                  <l>Tears of Dissimulation too, invite</l>
                  <l>Men to believe, God knows the Hypocrite.</l>
                  <l>When in devotion we our Case impart,</l>
                  <l>We should remember, God requires the heart.</l>
                  <l>Tears of Contrition give the piercing voice,</l>
                  <l>At which both God and Angels do rejoyce:</l>
                  <l>Such as were <hi>Mary Magdalens,</hi> who spent</l>
                  <l>Full thirty years in weeping, to repent.</l>
                  <l>St. <hi>Peter</hi> likewise, waking, look'd as sleeping,</l>
                  <l>His face b'ing surrow'd with continual weeping.</l>

                  <l>Like pools of <hi>Heshbon,</hi> glaz'd her eyes with Tears.</l>
                  <l>As Musick on the water sounds more sweet</l>
                  <l>Than on the land, so Pray'rs, with Tears, they greet</l>
                  <l>Almighty God with prevalence: all hours</l>
                  <l>God listens to effectual Oratours.</l>
                  <l>Then let our Tears into a deluge flow,</l>
                  <l>To drown our sins, and wash away our woe:</l>
                  <l>May they shoot forth like showers in the Spring,</l>
                  <l>To bathe our Souls in; 'tis an Offering</l>
                  <l>Well pleasing to the Lord. When <hi>Peter</hi> wept,</l>
                  <l>He look'd more lovely than as when he slept.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>David</hi> pathetically ever sung,</l>
                  <l>When Heart and Harp with Penitence was strung:</l>
                  <l>When to repose he laid his weari'd head,</l>
                  <l>Not Diamonds, but Tears adorn'd his bed.</l>
                  <l>And in the sacred Quire there's much more mirth</l>
                  <l>For one repentant sinner (so by birth)</l>
                  <l>Than persons just, Repentance needing none,</l>
                  <l>Though of an hundred there should want but one.</l>
                  <l>To Heav'n comes none but what are pure and cleer;</l>
                  <l>Heaven would not be Heav'n, if Sin were there.</l>

                  <l>With quiet, than contentions sacrifice:</l>
                  <l>Man is conceiv'd</l>

                  <l>For Heav'n is not so soon obtain'd as lost.</l>
                  <l>Prepare thy heart,</l>

                  <l>Where God must come:</l>

               <head>¶ Advice to Prisoners.</head>
               <lg>
                  <l>A Prison is a Cage of certain Cares,</l>
                  <l>Whose Birds sing tunes of Discords and Despairs.</l>
                  <l>So sares it in this fickle World;</l>
                  <l>Man's like a Foot-ball toss'd and hurl'd:</l>
                  <l>Even the Poor and honest Prisoners lie</l>
                  <l>Like silver Swans, to sing their last, and die.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But what's a Prison when the Soul is free?</l>
                  <l>A Jayl is but the World's Epitome:</l>
                  <l>There ye contemplate how to lie</l>
                  <l>I'th'Grave, before ye come to die;</l>
                  <l>Whilst others heaping up their stores of Pelf,</l>
                  <l>Have no more land, when dead, than you your self.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Consider, there are thousands are so low,</l>
                  <l>That they'd be glad to be as ye are now.</l>
                  <l>Your want of Liberty's a Rod</l>
                  <l>To scourge you neerer to your God.</l>
                  <l>Thus Providence to Prisoners is most kinde,</l>
                  <l>Their eyes to open, leaving others blinde.</l>

                  <l>A Prison is an honourable Jayl,</l>

                  <l>There's no light object to pervert</l>
                  <l>The candour of an upright heart.</l>
                  <l>Those Iron-bars that do your bodies hold,</l>

                  <l>Where Care will not, ne're act a foolish part:</l>
                  <l>For all the help that Care can do,</l>
                  <l>Is but to make one Sorrow two.</l>

                  <l>But when my kinde affections do intrude,</l>
                  <l>The Creature answers with ingratitude.</l>

                  <l>To him God answers, Son, be thou content,</l>
                  <l>For that's a bed adorn'd with Ornament.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Jacob</hi> slept on the ground; who would not deem</l>

                  <l>
                     <hi>Fox</hi> in his book of Martyrs, speaks of one,</l>
                  <l>A woman poor in <hi>Jersey,</hi> yet though grown</l>
                  <l>Mean to the World (when <hi>Mary, Englands</hi> Queen,</l>
                  <l>Drew on our English Stage a bloody Scene)</l>
                  <l>God made her bed in that same fiery flake;</l>
                  <l>And when she came as Martyr to the stake,</l>
                  <l>A Childe came from her, to her hearts desire:</l>
                  <l>So God brought her to bed by flames of fire.</l>
                  <l>He likewise threatned <hi>Jezabel,</hi> that she</l>
                  <l>Should have a bed of fire. His Justice he</l>
                  <l>Therein displays: May not his Mercy then</l>
                  <l>Turn flames of fire to beds for righteous men?</l>
                  <l>Nothing's impossible if God accord;</l>
                  <l>Fire shall prove Beds of Ease, say he the Word.</l>

                  <l>When I sing Psalms and Hymns to God on high,</l>

                  <l>Had God bestow'd on me a better voice,</l>

                  <l>Shall salve my want of skill with store of sence.</l>
                  <l>To that end, blessed Lord, in me create</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>SIn at the first seems small; when I begin,</l>
                  <l>I thus conclude, 'Tis but a little sin,</l>

                  <l>It suddenly appears so soul, so deep,</l>
                  <l>So dangerous a gulph doth widely gape,</l>
                  <l>That without drowning I can hardly scape.</l>
                  <l>Thus in extremities I always bleed;</l>
                  <l>My sins are small, they no repentance need;</l>
                  <l>Or else so great and heynous is my stain,</l>
                  <l>That I despair, I can't a pardon gain.</l>
                  <l>A Reed out of thy Sanctuary, Lord,</l>
                  <l>Would truly measure every deed and word.</l>
                  <l>But O if thou my misery reveal,</l>
                  <l>Do not thy mercy from my Soul conceal,</l>
                  <l>Lest if I apprehend my wounds gape wide,</l>
                  <l>My desperate Soul run out, and thereby glide</l>
                  <l>Into a world of to ments, if my grief</l>
                  <l>Seem to be greater than is thy relief.</l>

If sin seems greater by one breadth of hair</l>
                  <l>Than mercie doth, it makes way for despair.</l>
