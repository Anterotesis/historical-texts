            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:100144:3"/>
read and peruse them is no late or Novel usage; for it was in those times, or shortly after, not thought to be unfitting or unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to take the approbation and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Grave and Learned men, of such things as were to be made publicke, as <hi>Plinius</hi> Junior in his Epistles informs us so that it may with reason and evidence be concluded that the Dedication of Books was not originally to procure the favor of some great or good Man, neither were the Epistles Dedicatory heretofore acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with those gross Flatteries, untruths, or immense and accumulated praises of the Patrons or their Ancestors, which some Foraign Printers for their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate gain, do use in publishing Books out of some Copies and Manuscripts left by the deceased Authors, or as too many <hi>German</hi> and other Authors have of late stuffed their Dedications withall, which
<pb facs="tcp:100144:3"/>
Heroick and great Souls do so little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, as the Books themselves would meet with a better entertainment if they came without them; but one of the best and most approved usages of Dedications, hath certainly and most commonly been derived from no other Source or Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, then the great desire which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had (there being before printing most probably but a few Copies sent abroad) to receive the friendly censure and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of some Learned man, who would in those days carefully read and peruse it; and not as now too many men do <hi>oscitanter</hi> and cursorily take a view onely of the Frontispice or Title, and lay it in the Parlor or Hall Windows to be idly turned over by such as tarry to speak with them, or else crowd it in their better furnished then read or understood Libraries, to make a Muster or great

shew of such Forces as they have to bring into the Feild of Learning when there shall be any occasion to use them, but neither then or before are able to finde or say what is in them.</p>
            <p>But your Lordship being Master of the Learning in Books as well as of an excellent well furnished Library, with many choice Manuscripts never yet published, and very many Classick Authors and Volums printed and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pick't and gathered together out of the Gardens of good letters, which an <hi>unlearned</hi> and <hi>reforming</hi> Rebellion, and the Treachery of a wicked servant hired to discover them, did very much diminish.</p>
            <p>And your Eye and Judgement being able before hand to Calculate the Fate of the Author in the good or bad opinion
<pb facs="tcp:100144:4"/>
of all that go by any Rules or measure of right Reason, Learning or Judgement. I have adventured to present unto your Lordship these my Labours in the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Legality, Antiquity, right use and necessity of the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption</hi> and <hi>Pourveyance</hi> of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> or Compositions for the Provisions of their Royall houshold, for that your Lordship is so well able to judge of them, and having been <hi>Comptroller</hi> of the houshold to his Majesties Royal Father the <hi>Martyr,</hi> King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the First, and to the very great dangers of your person, and damage of your Estate, like one of <hi>Davids</hi> good servants gone along with him in all his Wars and troubles, when as he being first assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was inforced to take Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Rebellious and Hypocritical

part of his people in the defence of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his people, their Religion, Laws, and Liberties, and the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Parliament, and not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained Faithfull to him, during his life, but after his death unto his banished and strangely misused Royal Issue, when Loyalty and Truth were accompted crimes of the greatest magnitude, and like some houses infected with the plague, had more then one <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> set upon them with a Lord have mercy upon us.</p>
            <p>And did whilst that blessed King continued in his Throne and Regalities, so instruct your self in those Excellent Orders and Government of his house, as you have been able to enlighten and teach others, amongst whom I must acknowledge my self to have been one, and out of a Manuscript carefully

collected by your Lordship concerning the Rules and Orders of the Royal houshold, which your Lordship was pleased to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate unto me to have been very much informed, which together with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny favors with which you have been pleased to oblige me, the incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which you have given me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this work, and the great respect and veneration which I bear unto your Lordships grand accomplishments in the <hi>Encyclopaidia,</hi> large extent and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses of all kinde of learning, and your knowledge of Foraign Courts and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, which being very extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if you were of the ranke of private men must needs be very much more when it shall be added to the eminency of your Birth and qualitie, and the Trust and Emploiments which his Majesty hath been pleased deservedly to confer upon

to such as fight with their own sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, or trouble themselves when there is neither any cause or necessity for it, when as the Act of Parliament for taking away <hi>Pourveyance</hi> and the Court of Wards and Liveries, and Tenures by Knight Service, either of the King or others in <hi>Capite,</hi> or <hi>Socage</hi> in <hi>Capite</hi> did not expressely alleage or allow those Tenures and the incidents thereof to be their just rights, but onely that <hi>the consequences upon the same have been much more burthensom, griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and <hi>prejudicial to the Kingdom, then they have been beneficial to the King; and alleadging also that by like experience it hath been found that notwithstanding divers good, strickt and wholsom Laws, some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending as far as to life for redress of the grievances and oppressions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb facs="tcp:100144:7"/>
by the persons imployed in making provisions for the Kings houshold, and of the Carriages and other provisions for his occasions, yet they have been still continued, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Counties have submitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to sundry rates, Taxes, and Compositions to redeem themselves from such vexations and oppressions, and that no other remedy will be so effectual as to take away the occasion thereof, especially if satisfaction and recompence shall be therefore made to his Majesty his heirs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,</hi> so as very many or most of the seduced and factious part of the people of this Nation having in the times of our late confusions been mislead or driven into an ill opinion of it, may with the residue of the people be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily carryed along with the croud to a

more then imagination, that the <hi>Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance</hi> and <hi>Prae-emption,</hi> was no less then a very great grievance, and that his Majesty was thereby induced to accept of a recompence or satisfaction for it, and permit the people to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase the abolition of that which they supposed to have been a grievance, which do appear neither to be a griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance nor recompence, but a great loss to the King, and as much or more in the conclusion <hi>consideratis considerandis</hi> to the people.</p>

in the method or stile, some defects or redundancies, impertinent Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies or digressions, or want of coheren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which might have been prevented or amended, if I could have enjoyed an <hi>Otium</hi> or privacy requisite for such an undertaking, or have had time to have searched the Archives, and too much unknown or uninquired after Records of the Kings just &amp; legal <hi>Regalias,</hi> or those multitudes of liberties, customs, and priviledges which the Lords of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and their Tenants do at this day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy by the favour of the King and his royal Progenitors, or to have raked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rubbidge of time long ago tripped over, and the not every where to be found <hi>Abdita rerum,</hi> or recesses of venerable Antiquity, or to have viewed all at once what I had done in its parts

               </note> not to change the Laws which he had ordained for them, but would rather endure a ten years absence, not much unlike a banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from that his beloved country, because he would not give them any occasion or temptation of changing them, and that our late Factious and ignorant <hi>Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> have been far exceeded and outgone by the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and overwise seeming Members, or parts of the body natural, represented in <hi>Menenius Agrippa's</hi> happy Fable to the seditious <hi>Romans</hi> of the mutiny of the Members of the body natural, against the <hi>Belly</hi> or Paunch thereof who did not in all that contention and desire of some better (as they thought) order to be enacted betwixt it and the Members, many of them having several intents and interests, propose as our late <hi>Giddy Reformers</hi> have done any thing against the Soveraignity or Supremacy of the Head, or to dislocate or cast it into a meaner scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or condition amongst its inferiors, upon pretence

            <p>And we cannot therefore without some wonder, contemplate the vast difference which appears to have been betwixt all the heretofore popular Pretences, and intended Reformations of the <hi>Athenian</hi> and <hi>Spartan</hi> Commonwealths now sufficiently quieted and purged of those humors by a <hi>Turkish</hi> Tyranny, and that of the <hi>Romans</hi> in their many Tumults and Seditions under their many several sorts of Governments, and our godly (as they called themselves) <hi>Reformers</hi> of laws, &amp; amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>male administration</hi> (as they supposed) in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, when as those <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> being Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, could pursue their ends without rapine and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of their fellow citizens, but our men of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Innovation, could in their <hi>vertigo</hi> and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning of Kingdoms and good Laws, finde the way to all manner of Ravage Rapine and Injustice, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich and advance themselves by that great gain and spoil which they met with, by the alteration of Laws, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadeing their Neighbors and other mens Proprieties.</p>

Whosoever hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or killeth any venison (which is there much of their food) he bringeth him his Fee, which is the fourth part of the same, if it be killed on the Land, but if in the water, then the skin thereof.

               <p>And if the rates which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> accepted her provisions to be served in by the Counties had been agreed to have been paid in money and not in kind, and had by the fall of the Markets, which the Lawes well executed would in a Kingdome of peace and plenty have easily brought to pass, been too high a rate, and more then the provisions served in kind would have amounted unto, those who made that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement for themselves and the Counties and places which they represented could not have receded from it, no more then she or her Successors, if the provisions

served in kind should have grown cheaper, or might have been had for less money, or been bought by her Officers at easier rates then the Compositions, could without the help of a <hi>Proviso,</hi> with honour or Justice have desired that her provisions might not have been served in kind by the several Counties of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> but that the money or rate then agreed upon to have been the price of those provisions should have been yearly paid into the <hi>Exchequer</hi> to be disposed of for that purpose, which probably might have been the reason that at the first agreement made by several Counties for the Compositions, some for 3 years, some for four, and some for seven, there was a <hi>proviso</hi> that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party disliking (which until our mad times or quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling with the fifth Commandement, and finding fault with every thing that fed not the rebellious humour, was not at all done by the Counties) should be at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and free from that agreement.</p>

               <p>Experience having told our Progenitors how much the necessities and wants of some of our Kings and Princes, have heretofore given way to the excursions of some of their servants and Ministers, upon the rights and liberties of the people, which made the Lords and Commons in Parliament frequently in sundry Ages and Parliaments past, to take a great care for the support and honor of their House-keeping, the preserving of the Kings Rights and Revenues, and the punishment of such as were any cause of the waste or diminishing of it.</p>
               <p>And that a supply of the Kings wants, or for the payment of his debts, could never yet, nor can be so <hi>Arithmetically</hi> made or proportioned either as to what was past or to come, as to even the Tax or Assesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the people, or to make them to be just so much and no more then the Kings wants, but were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes like the Tax in <hi>France</hi> for money to buy the Queen <hi>Pins</hi>; or the Aids given to some Foreign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to marry their eldest daughters, which amounted unto many times double the sum of the greatest porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they gave with them; or the Aides in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to make the Prince or the Kings eldest son a Knight, when the expences never came neer the sum contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, and as heretofore the City of <hi>London</hi> and other Cities and Corporations have done in their Taxes and Subsidies leavyed upon the Citizens and Townesmen,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:100144:148"/>
which did usually by a considerable <hi>everplus</hi> furmount the necessities and occasions of them.</p>
               <p>Or if there could be any Reason, Prudence, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, for the people to permit their Soveraign who is to protect and defend them to live under the Tyranny, discredits and pressures of Debts and necessities, when as that which is grievous or too much for him to bear, may easily be supplyed or helpt by a contribution of the multitude, or many giving every one a little.</p>
               <p>It cannot be for their good that the Kings small Revenue, and the Hospitality and honor of his house-keeping should be subject to the enhaunce of Prices, cosening and cheating of Tradesmen, and of every one which his Officers and Servants shall have occasion to deal with, or that the Royal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues should be like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> lean kine, devoured by the fat, or daily tormented and gnawn upon like <hi>Titius</hi> heart in the Fable, with greedy and never gorged Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>Which if the King and his Revenue could bear at the present, will be every year and oftener more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, as the pride of the people and their avarice, and cheating to maintain it shall multiply.</p>
               <p>When such a great Provision of Meat and Victuals as is necessarily to be made for the Kings houshold, and his multitude of Servants and Attendants, will when his Provision shall not be sent in (as formerly to his Court which did prevent it) sweep and take away the best sorts of Provisions from the Markets, and as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath already told us, make scarce and dear, all Commodities not only in the Markets within the Virge, or in or near <hi>London,</hi> but in the more remote places, or

threescore miles off, and as far as <hi>Salisbury,</hi> all that can be brought to the Markets near the Kings residence or his occasions.</p>
               <p>Teach the people to heighten their Prices whose mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and rule of Conscience is to ask high rates, and take as much as by any pretences, tales, falshoods or devices they can get; and more of the King, Nobility, and Gentry, then of the Mechanick or Common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and get thereby unjustly of the King more then all their Subsidies and Assessements (if they be not very great) shall come unto.</p>
               <p>And if the great enhaunce of Prices were not or could not be so great a consumption of the Kings Revenue, it must needs be altogether indecent and unbefitting the Duty and Honor of Subjects to their Kings.</p>

               <p>For as it is true that in <hi>Virginia</hi> where their principal <hi>Barter</hi> or <hi>Exchange</hi> is by <hi>Tobacco</hi> instead of money, and is there many times used as their Coyn or money; that where any man there is in want of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and must needs have it, he will be willing to give more Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Skins, or any other commodities which he hath for it, then he would otherwise do if <hi>Tobacco</hi> were more plentiful or easier to be had. And as certain likewise that when there is great store of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and it is (in the language of Merchants and Tradesmen) but as a Drug and of little price or value, there will not be so much of other things or commodities given for it.</p>
               <p>So it will be as true and certain that there is in no Kingdom or Country of Christendom, especially in our <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>other world</hi> where (howsoever some Cosmographers and Chartes or Mapps, would by a great mistake make Gold to be a Native) the Sun is not so amorous as to beget us Mines of Gold, nor is there any probability that there ever were any, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any <hi>Tagus</hi> or River bringing any gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Sands along with it. And that which we have of Silver is but rarely and seldom intermixed, and lurking

in our Mines of Lead; there can be no ground for our belief or reason that there should be such a disesteem or under valuing of Gold and Silver, in regard of any plenty of it, as was amongst the <hi>Americans</hi> or <hi>West Indians,</hi> when they would give great quantities of it for Knives, Beads, or other Toys which the novelty of them or their desires to have them, made to be pretious, or that there should ever be such a surfet of Gold and Silver which most of the sons of men do desire to get or keep, as to make all things dear which are to be bought with it, or to hinder that cheapness of things to be bought with it, which will be of necessity where there happens to be an abundance, which is the true and never failing cause of cheapness abstracted and altogether a stranger to any supposed plenty of money, neither the want of money or plenty of it, being generally any sole proper or efficient cause of cheapness or dearness, which residing in the commodity to be bought or fold <hi>tanquam in subjecta materia,</hi> as in its matter or subject regulates and makes the price when there are no fraudes or Artifices to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe it according as there is a scarcity or plenty of that which is to be bought or sold, which is the cause that the scarcity of money hath not in all ages made or enforced a cheapness of commodities or houshold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions to be bought with it, nor a plenty of money made a dearness or enhaunce of prices, nor any thing like or within many degrees of that which is n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
