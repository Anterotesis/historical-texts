         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I haue cleared the ſecond accuſation of cruelty,
bloud, and bloudy preſecution for conſcience,
evidently proouing by their owne account, vnto
the vnderſtanding of the moſt ſimple, that is not
wilfully blind, that many more of the firſt ſort ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
death, and were in fire conſumed onely
for their conſcience, within the leſſe then ſix

it appeareth how vnjuſtly our late woorthy
Queene, our preſent gracious King &amp; their State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſters,
haue been and are moſt jmpudently &amp;
falſely of bloud &amp; cruelty accuſed &amp; taxed.</p>
            <p>Nor haue I ought herein written to giue ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to any ſuch (for let them ſincke in their

all Rebellions, all Attempts, <hi>vi, aut fraude,</hi> againſt
the perſons and ſtates of our late Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
and our now preſent King, both were and
are not only lawfull, but meritorious: But to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
ſuch of them as being of a milder temper,
(and yet looking that way) willingly confeſſe
and acknowledge, that all ſuch as haue beene or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19139:5"/>
are guilty of ſuch crimes, haue deſeruedly been
puniſhed; but yet doe, or at leaſt ſeeme to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
that their Prieſts and Ieſuites haue ſuffered
onely for their Conſciences, and therefore their
perſecution (they being many in nomber) is (in
their judgement) great and lamentable. Which
were it graunted, or could (as it neuer can) bee
prooued that they all dyed for their conſcience
onely, (which yet is a conſcience miſ-enformed)
yet doth the nomber of our true Martyrs in leſſe
then 6. yeres of Queene <hi>Maries</hi> raigne, (although
it ſhould be permitted vnto them to take alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their number thoſe fifty and two lay perſons,
(for ſo many I thinke there are) regiſtred with the
Prieſts and Ieſuites in their owne Martyrologe)
not onely equallize, but exceed the number of
theirs in full fifty yeares ſince, by the number of
almoſt 100. perſons. Inſomuch, that if the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of perſons ſuffering, and the number of
yeeres of both ſorts wherein they ſuffered bee
compared, and the cauſe of all their ſufferings ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to be alike juſt or vnjuſt (of which there
is no compariſon) yet did the cruelty of Queene
<hi>Marie</hi> and her popiſh Clergie, out-ſtrip Queene
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> and king <hi>Iames</hi> conjoyned, more then
tenne for one; and therefore learne, you that
haue any ſparke of grace remaining in you, to be
good ſubiects to your King, and ceaſe now at

Author, whome for the number of ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors

happily (for it is almoſt jmpoſsible to bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe)
in ſome things in ſo large a volume, hee
might commit ſome ſmall errour in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
cicumſtances, becauſe no Hiſtorian can
poſsibly be preſent euery where with his owne
eyes and eares, but muſt of neceſsity giue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
vnto the relations of others in many poynts;
Yet the granity of his perſon, his excellent lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
his great reading, his worthy and ſober ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
his ſound judgement, and therein his wiſe
choyce of Authours, and the generall report of
his honeſt and religious mind, by an vniforme
conſent of all ſuch as knew him, freeth him from
taxation of any wilfull and groſſe errour, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
miſtaking, and from any malicious aſlertion
againſt the Papiſts without a probable ground,
throughout his worthy woorke, in whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
I thinke it needleſſe to beſtowe much
paines, becauſe the honeſter and greater ſort
are honeſtly already of him perſwaded, and
for the reſt as they are for number fewer, and
their honeſty little worth, ſo ate they many of

<hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Foxe</hi> hath noted <hi>Iohn Rogers</hi> the firſt Martyr
in Queene <hi>Marie</hi> her dayes, to haue ſuffered
February 4. 1555. which yet according to our
account was in the yeare 1554. Likewiſe the
Pſeudomartyrologiſt hath in his Martyrologe
noted <hi>William Richardſon</hi> to haue beene executed
Feb. 27. 1603. which might ſeeme to be in the
firſt yeare of King <hi>Iames,</hi> which yet was in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            <p>Now hauing compared their numbers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

then ſix yeares raigne of Queene <hi>Marie</hi> onely for

Crown which he forſook for Chriſts loue (for he

ſurpaſſe, and one maine reaſon hereof, as I take it,
is becauſe they hold the laye Papiſts, of whome
they haue their maintenance, in ſuch a thraldome
of jgnorant obedience, as that they dare not for
feare of damnation read any booke whereby to
enforme them in the truth, but only ſuch as their
traiterous and ſeditious vn-ghoſtly leaders ſhall
permit: And ſo if they can hold the good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

               <p>If any friend ſhall thinke that this my labour

that I do the Papiſts too great a grace, by placing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19139:12"/>
them in the ſame Booke with the true Martyrs of
Chriſt; to him in friendly manner I thus replye,
and firſt to the firſt. That though his allegation
bee indeed true (for I willingly confeſſe that hee

that wayes, and hath compaſſed ſo much and
ſuch variety of matter therein, as that I cannot

and Recuſants, for vnleſſe I ſhould ſet downe
their names, I could make no good compariſon
of their numbers in oppoſition one to the other;
which is the eſpeciall end whereat I aime.</p>
               <p>Secondly, although that twentie or thirtie

                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:19139:12"/>
but now theſe <hi>Viue-ſpeakers</hi> in Chriſts cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by time conſumed, it is more needfull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
by theſe neuer-dying memorials, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of their ſufferings, eſpecially ſeeing
the aduerſarie is ſo buſie by all meanes that the
Pope, the Diuell, or hell it ſelfe can poſsibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe
to exalt their faction, and to bring a ſcandall
both vpon our Soveraignes, vs, and them.</p>
               <p>And to the ſecond poynt; That it is a Grace
vnto the Papiſts and Romaniſts to haue their
Prieſts and Ieſuites ranked with the true Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
I anſwere thus: It is not the puniſhment,
nor the place, but onely the cauſe that maketh
a man famous for vertue, or for vice jnfamous,
loued of God for his owne free graces, or hated
of God and good men for their villanies.</p>
               <p>If the Iron barres whereon <hi>Catesbies</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
heads are fixed and nailed on the Parliament
houſe, be a grace vnto them or any of their fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
becauſe they poſſeſſe the higheſt places of
that Honourable houſe; ſuch grace haue all the
kings enemies. If <hi>Garnets</hi> ſcaffold becauſe it was
rayſed aloft for more publique view, were an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
vnto him or any of his Ieſuited ſociety, ſuch
honour haue all that are, were, or hereafter ſhall
be his partakers. If <hi>London</hi> bridge or Newgate
grace that faction, becauſe their friends diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
limbes are ſo highly thereon aduanced; let
Crowes and Rauens likewiſe deuour all them
that deſerue the like grace for the like jnfidelity.
Laſtly, if <hi>Iudas</hi> their fellow-traitor can any whit
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19139:13"/>
at all grace them becauſe he is noted in the booke
of God, (but with this foule addition, Traitour)
let them likewiſe take him and make him a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their Company, or rather jncorporate
themſelues into his Society, but let all that beare
ill will to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Kings
Majeſtie as a principall member thereof; let I
ſay, their ends (oh God) be like vnto their maſter
<hi>Iudas,</hi> and let their bowels breake in ſunder that
would eat out the bowels of thy Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and let this blacke word of Traitour bee
the jndelible ſpot, neuer to bee waſhed away,
wherewith I brand all Engliſh Italionated Prieſts
and Ieſuites, and their Abbettors. Adde to theſe
alſo the <hi>Iacobine</hi> Fryer and <hi>Rauilack,</hi> the two mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers

committed pleaded and ſtrongly argued to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from that lenitie of his, in permitting a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of conſcience to his ſubiects in matter of
Religion; whereby they would inferre, that if our

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19139:13"/>
from any ſuch attempts, not needing to feare pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill
either by ſtabbing, poyſoning, powder, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
then let a toleration begraunted; but
how ſound their concluſion is, <hi>France</hi> hath felt,
<hi>England</hi> may feare, and all the world is amazed
thereat.</p>
               <p>For if the King of <hi>France</hi> being a Papiſt, and at
moſt but ſuſpected to affect the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
could not yet be ſecure in his perſon, how
much leſſe can our King expect any aſſurance
of ſaftie by a toleration, his Majeſty being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
a profeſſed Proteſtant, and directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
in Faith and Religion. Nay it might rather
bee much feared, that it would bee a meanes to
pull Gods juſt judgements vpon him and vs, for
permiſsion of ſuch falſe worſhippe of the true
God; for ſo wee may read in diuers places of
the Old Teſtament, that when the Rulers of the
people fell away from God, God ſent vpon them
many plagues, miſeries, and oppreſsions by
their enemies. And thus much in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere

withdrawe and alienate the hearts of his ſubiectes, (for
ſo they all doe) from their due allegeance.) And for this

formerly <hi>(nominatim)</hi> by the Pope Excommunicated,
and therevpon by the ſeducing of Prieſtes and Ieſuites,
(the firebrands of Chriſtendome) expoſed both in her

holding him no longer to bee their King
by lawfull right of ruling, then the Pope pleaſeth; which
is onely thus qualified, <hi>Rebus ſic ſtantibus; cùm deerunt
vires,</hi> as long as they needes muſt, and that they dare
doe no otherwiſe for feare of their neckes. Is it not then
great reaſon (to you that in CHRIST haue learned to
obey I ſpeake) that his maieſtie ſhould as neere as hee
can, preuent ſuch daungers to himſelfe and his State? But
here it may bee the Prieſts will reply and ſay: <hi>Wee are
bound by oath, and therefore in conſcience, to goe whether ſoeuer
thoſe of whom wee receiue our Prieſtly Orders, ſhall enioyne
vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But firſt anſwere me; who enforced you thereto, either
to leaue your country or to take that order? Did Queene
Elizabeth? doth King Iames? doe you not that of your
owne voluntarie wils contrarie to your own known coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie

            <p>Secondly, whether that ſingle (ſinnefull I may ſay)
Oath bee of ſufficient authoritie to diſſolue that treble

            <p>Thirdly, if you before knowing the daunger thereof
will yet voluntarily take ſuch oaths; where then is the

grounds ſhall in a religious policie, to preuent the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard

vpon Thurſday the 16. of Iune 1608.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt queſtion was this.</hi> Whether the ſaide Garnet

            <p>

Garnet himſelfe helde lands, which by lawfull and lineall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
had deſcended from his aunceſtors vnto him, it
were lawfull for the Pope, Garnet being by him excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated,

Noe. Why then, mildely replied the Biſhoppe,</hi> what
reaſon haue you Maiſter Garnet, to hold that the Pope hath
more authoritie ouer the Kings Maieſtie, being your Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,

neglect that offer which Pope Paulus the fourth made
vnto Queene Elizabeth in the beginning of her Raigne,
who when he perceiued that his vſurped authoritie and
Primateſhip grew in England contemptible, condicional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that hee might hold that power here that vniuſtly hee
had before done when this land was drowned in Poperie,
would haue beene contented, and cauſed the Queenes
Maieſtie to vnderſtand that hee would be pleaſed, <hi>that all

that then they were, (being the very ſame then <hi>per omnia,</hi>
that now it is) onely his Supremacie muſt bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
for that indeed, not Religion, not godlineſſe,
not any thing but pride and ambition to be in the eyes of
the world aboue all, both was and is the cauſe of his raging
madneſſe.</p>
            <p>But that noble ſpirited Queene, whoſe religion was
founded vpon a rock, Chriſt Ieſus being the chiefe corner
ſtone, by whom all her building was ioyned together,
ſcorned to be beholding to that Italian Prieſt for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe

of the other, that his authoritie may reciprocally helpe
to keepe that Crowne vpon the head of him and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,

<hi>Clawe me and I will claw thee: Let they vſurped authoritie
