         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the <hi>READER.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>CHristian Reader, (whither <hi>Presbyterian, Prelaticall,</hi> or <hi>Independent</hi>) I have thought fit, briefly, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise unto thee three or four Considerations, both for <hi>Thy</hi> better satisfaction, and the cleering of <hi>mine-own</hi> integrity and ingenuity, as also by way of anticipation of some objections which perhaps may arise in thee touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>manner</hi> of my penning and publishing of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Treatise. <hi>viz:</hi> That, whereas, first of all, it may, peradventure, be imputed unto me for <hi>levity</hi> or <hi>indecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> in thus prefixing M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Goodwin's</hi> picture to this my Treatise: I answer, in breif (though I could say much more in justification of what I have, herein, done) That when I considered the excessive <hi>Pride of the man,</hi> to be so shamelessely (<hi>Narcissus-like</hi>) in love with his own picture, as to have it (or to suffer it to be) prefixed before, at least, three or foure of his formerly published hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and most poysonous <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> I therefore resolved so far to indulge his own <hi>humour</hi> and <hi>tumour</hi> of <hi>Pride,</hi> as to set him forth in his proper posture, with an <hi>Ecce Homo-, Her's the man,</hi> That is the <hi>Patron of Heresie,</hi> and <hi>Shame of Divinity.</hi> As for the <hi>Embleme over his head,</hi> of the <hi>Winde-Mill</hi> and <hi>Weather-Cock</hi>; Certainly, tis no more than his <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vitiosity</hi> of minde have justly merited, which is continually <hi>Coyning</hi> and <hi>Contriving,</hi> in his <hi>busie-brain</hi> and <hi>hereticall-heart,</hi> one blasphemous <hi>Errour</hi> or another (Still) to pollute and poyson the Soules of his miserably Seduced Proselytes. For the <hi>Motto out of his mouth,</hi> Tis but <hi>his own fraudulent and fallacious Engine,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53595:3"/>
whereby he (Still) hopes to help himself, at a dead lift, when he is closly put to it; Namely, to print and protest to his Proselytes, <hi>That he (Poore innocent Man) is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more (herein) unhappy, to be continually mistaken in what he writes or Speakes, and to have his words daily wrested, and taken alwayes in the worst Sense:</hi> By that <hi>Motto,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I thought fit to minde him of his own <hi>Machivillian-Machination,</hi> wherewith he familiarly abuses his too cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulus <hi>Coleman-street</hi> Companions. As for <hi>Moro-Mastix, A whip for a Fool,</hi> (which, you see, <hi>He</hi> scornfully puts away with his hand, as a too-stinging <hi>Noli me tangere</hi>); tis but in a just requitall of his most hereticall <hi>Hagio-Mastix,</hi> his lashing and lying against <hi>Truth</hi> and her pious Presbyterian Servants. And, as for that notorious <hi>lying-Elogie,</hi> penn'd by (it seems) one of his prime and most precious Proselytes, under his picture; I was (I confesse) so transported (at the first sight thereof) with holy indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation against it, that I could not forbear to retort those blasphemous untruths into the teeth of the <hi>Malepart Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> &amp; his <hi>daubing-Disciple</hi>; &amp; to let the world see (more truely) the insolent <hi>Arrogancie</hi> of the <hi>One,</hi> and the <hi>lying-Vanity</hi> of the <hi>Other.</hi> And whereas, yet again; 'tis like it will be objected by Some; That surely, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all you have hitherto said; yet this making his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, especially in such a posture, will but exasperate and provoke more and more wrath and discontent, both in their writing and speaking against us for it. To which I answer; Truly, my Brethren, in my judgement, It is most fit it should do so, yea, and vex, and sting them to the very quick: You know (Deare Friends) who it was that said.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Num.</hi> 25.17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>Vex the Midianites and smite them.</hi> And why must this be so? The Lord himself gives the answer and reason. <hi>Because they vex you with their wiles, and gull and
<pb facs="tcp:53595:3"/>
beguile you.</hi> And, I beseech you, tell me; what have we gotten, all this while, by our so tender handling these angry-Nettles? Have they not, thereby, stung us the more foundly? Whereas, had wee, at the first, handled these thistles, brambles and bryers (like the plain Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) with roughly-grasping hedging-cuffs of just and lawfull severity; VVe had (I doubt not) long ere this, made them bend and bow: VVhereas, now, by most unseemly and sinfull sufferance, they are become unto us (like Israels <hi>Canaanites</hi>) thorns in our eyes and goads to our sides, to prick and spoil us, if the Lord, in mercie, prevent it not. But, whereas, in the last place, it is more than probable, that Some (yea, many) will be too apt to taxe me with too-much <hi>rigidnesse</hi> and <hi>austerity</hi> of my <hi>Style,</hi> in writing too-<hi>roughly</hi> and <hi>bitterly</hi> against him: To these I reply, That I cannot but wonder, that any (especially <hi>Independents</hi>) should, herein, reprove or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend me, since, even this their great pretended <hi>Master of Moderation,</hi> himself, doth so frequently and familiarly use this manner of writing, even as if it were connative and genuine unto him; yea, in his most impious answer to ever to be honored M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Edwards</hi> his famous <hi>Antapologia,</hi> he hath written a peice of a Treatise in justification of this manner of writing: But, what need I? (nay, I even disdain) his pattern or practise (as tis his) to apologize for me, herein? Since the whole-stream and Current of the <hi>Sacred Scripture,</hi> it <hi>Self</hi> (whose Copy to write by, cannot but be, above all, most Comely and Canonicall) doth so amply authorize, and so abundantly justifie this manner of writing (which the world calls <hi>rough</hi> and <hi>rigid</hi>) in a narrative or historicall way of most sharply reproving the <hi>Works</hi> and obstinate <hi>Workers</hi> of iniquity, impiety, and blasphemy against precious and unspotted <hi>Truth</hi>;
<pb facs="tcp:53595:4"/>
yea, and that, with such <hi>ironicall-jeerings</hi> and <hi>scoffings</hi> of them, such <hi>bitter</hi> and <hi>biting taunts</hi> and <hi>termes</hi> (with holy reverence to Gods word be it spoken) most justly cast upon them, as it is hardly possible for any other pen to doe more, or more <hi>sharply</hi> or <hi>cuttingly,</hi> as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> pertinently expresseth it. <hi>Titus.</hi> 1.13. And, truely, my Christian Brethren, if ever any <hi>incorrigible-Worker</hi> of iniquity, any bould and blasphemous-<hi>Heretick</hi> (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his brother <hi>Paul Best</hi>) in this our age, deserved to be soundly &amp; severely lasht (even by that most just law of <hi>Like for Like, Judg.</hi> 1.5. and, by that right rule of wise King <hi>Solomon,</hi> of <hi>answering a fool according to his folly. Pro.</hi> 26.5.) then, certainly, this proud, this presumptuous <hi>Fool</hi> most worthily meriteth to be met with all, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by his own bushell (as, I hope, ere long, he will, by a far better and abler pen than mine is) and to be most <hi>soundly</hi> and <hi>severly whipt</hi> and <hi>scourged,</hi> that, if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>he may become sound in the faith</hi>; which, the Lord, knows, is my souls desire for him.

            <p>And, now, to conclude, with a word to my moderate Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Brethren; If any <hi>Eliab,</hi> or <hi>Christian Elder Brother,</hi> whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, shall (as <hi>He</hi> did unjustly and unkindly blame his blessed youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger brother <hi>David</hi>) check this my <hi>cordiall zeal</hi> and unfeigned fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour (the Lord knows) for <hi>God,</hi> &amp; his most pure &amp; precious <hi>Truth,</hi>

No, truly, my deare <hi>Brethren, For Syons sake, the Lord knows, I could not hold my peace,</hi> nor with-hold my pen; <hi>for precious Truths sake, and her faithfull servants sakes (whom I saw and observed to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually so baffled with, and so grosly abused by this bold and unblushing Mountebanke) I could not let him alone.</hi> And, because I have very good reason confidently to believe that hereby I have mightily mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested a <hi>humming Hornets-nest,</hi> I, therfore, undauntedly resolved, by the grace of my God, <hi>to prepare my back for the smiters, &amp; my cheeks for them,</hi>
