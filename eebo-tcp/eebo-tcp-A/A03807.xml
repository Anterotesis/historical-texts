            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>That he had vnderſtood to his great content, ſo great quantitie of corne, to haue bene of late found amongſt the cittiſens: that they muſt eſpecially be carefull, that by a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring diſtribution, it might be likewiſe lenghtned, wherby he might haue the more time to bringe ſupplies for which cauſe, he laboured with all poſſible endeauour, in France, England, and in the confederated prouinces. That for the ſame reſpect, Mansfeld was come, that adioyning his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, he might recall <hi>Spinola</hi> from the ſiege. That they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re now coming, and had bene there, had not the contrary windes hindred them. That there were two thouſand horſe (beſides ſome companies gathered in the Seigniorie of Lie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, and elſe where) fourteene thouſand English foote. at Douer; ready to take ship. The reſt of the foot in Germanie, and the confederated prouinces, choſen by him, to the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of eleuen thouſand, already shipped, with certaine other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies, expected the weather. That they had already on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, ſet ſayle, but by a contrarie winde were driuen back. That as touching the confederated States, that they would ſpare no coſt nor labor, to aduance Mansfelds endeauours, and to deliuer Breda, hauing by a new decree ordained to gather four thouſand horſe, (aboue the number of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed armie) in England and France; and there, more then ſix thouſand foote. That as it was firmelie hoped, the ſpringe approaching, that there should be armed, fortie
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7366:65"/>
thouſand ſoote, and ſix thouſand horſe, to deliuer Breda by one meanes or other. That as to the great good of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie and of the cittie, he wished, that the victualls (which Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinus him ſelfe had written) might laſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the preſent te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th day of lanuarie, for a hundred and eight dayes next enſuing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euen vntill the Calends of May. And albeit he hoped vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that his whole armie should be ready much ſooner, yet he prayed them, that the victualls should be prolonged by ſparing them, as much as might be, to the end that more ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me might be gayned, both for his owne and another armie, which was as yet abiding in the borders of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Now, that he deſired to vnderſtand, what he tought of diſtributing a certaine portion of bread, to the ſoldiars, to the cittiſens, to their wiues and children: that it ſeemed to him a thinge worthie of conſideration, that commonly then more was wont to be eaten, ther when bread was giuen out by meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re: otherwiſe not to buy more then was vſuall and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, eſpecially when it was sould at a high price. Beſides that that thinge was wont to giue occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to tumults, how great caution ſoeuer was vſed for the conſeruation of Iuſtice. wherfore that he left all that to the iudgment of the ſenat it ſelfe, and councell of war, what ſoeuer they should determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to be for the good and profit of ſparing of victualls. what the ſoldiars horſes were to doe (corne and fodder being ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) that he dealt with the States therabouts. Tat they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, to pay the wages which the horſmen were to receiue for theſe that were aliue, more then for thoſe that were ſlai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, ſo that an indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t valuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were made therof. wherfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re that they should, refufe nothing to endure extreme hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gar, it being published abroad, that they should be ſlaine. That they should keepe their milche-cowes (becauſe milke was very nourishing) for reliefe in their, laſt extremitie, as long as any forredge laſted. And although it was not to be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he had of late with ſpecial diligence, viſited al the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7366:66"/>
granaries and ſtore-houſes of the cittie yet that he prayed him, continually to looke about by all meanes, to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the common ſtore houſe, if parhaps any thinge were hid by any one by deceit. Furthermore, that it was related to him by the Senat, of the carefull deſire of the people of Breda, for the mittigating of all the diſtreſſes of the ſiege, with their owne purſe and corne; but that there were alſo complaints brought by them, againſt the inſolencie of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe that were to defend them, who although they could not iuſtly complaine, nether of lodging, nor of fire, nor of their pay, nor of any exceſſiue price of meates, yet by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie and force, both by day and night, were careles ether to breake downe the houſes, or dig up gardens, or to pluck up their hedges, of their orchardes, or to ſpoile their ſtables, their shops and ſtanding places, and that only for lack of diſcipline, when ſome lately put in priſon for theſe faultes, yet eſcaped without punishment. VVhich example dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les might coole the feruour and promptitude of the citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens in watching, who now began to plead for them ſelues, that their owne houſes were to be kept againſt their dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall enimie, before the walles them ſelues: wherfore he deſired, that if the ſame were hereafter found, they should be more ſeuerly looked vnto who ſo should offend, to the intent that the feare of punishment might deter others: for that it was the part of ſoldiars, to forbid iniuries to the citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens. And that it was his pleaſure, that theſe his letters should be deliuered to the Captaines, and aſſiſtants of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of war, wherby they may vnderſtand, that neceſſarilie ſuch in commodities of the cittiſens, were to be prouided for, who were ſufficiently oppreſſed in other thinges. That of the new trench of the enimie, placed toward Seuenber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue there was agreat palizado made of poſts, Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, the States ceaſe not to damme vp the riuer of Breda neere Seuenbergue, and that it should be shortly finished:

an armie of the enimie, should break in behinde him at vnawares, as they had appointed at the beginning of the ſpringe. That trenche when it was finished, in the whole compaſſe, contayned fiftie two thouſand paces, ſo much greater was this then that former made on the ſodaine contayning no more then thirtie thouſand ſix hundred pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

The quarter of <hi>Spinola</hi> in the village of Genik, with that which Salazarius generall of the horſe, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at his back, were incloſed with a trenche of two and twentie thouſand ſix hundred thirtee three paces.

Diuers <note place="margin">Other forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaſiones of the quarteres</note> redutes were alſo adioyned, by reaſon of the perill and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous cituation of the place. They were ſo fortified with new receptacles, and with many other workes, that none but he who ſaw them, could hardly conceiue the frame of ſo great workes; ſo that I. May with out iniurie, truly tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me them, a very Labyrinth of fortifications. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of all the workes in the campes (beſides thoſe fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were built in diuers villages, ether to defend <note place="margin">Incredibile greatnes of the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones.</note> the conuoyes, or to defend the irruptions) were a hundred ſeauentie eight: refuges, fourſcore and ſixtine: redutes, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſeauen: fortes fortie fiue with batteries reforſed: ſo far did this ſiege ſurpaſſe the renowmed endeauours of Ceſar, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Aleſia and Dyrachium, where there were no more but four and twentie fortes without any more fortificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes but atrence.</p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7366:69"/>
                  <hi>Iſabella,</hi> hauing often tried the honeſtie of that ſo well knowen man, thought it beſt to ſignifi by ſilence, how litle credit he had with her, and how litle she feared his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine gathered and vnexpert armie, fitter for the plough, then for the war, nor compoſed ſcarcely of any other, then of ſoldiars compelled by force, she being fortified with ſo many and ſo expert ſoldiars.</p>
               <p>In the meane ſpace, thoſe of Breda, whilſt they ſee them ſelucs entrenched with ſo great workes, both expect with longe hope, for Mansfieldes helpe, and he (toſſed too and fro with the ſea) to tarrie longer then they expected, began to groane and to wax wearie. For now cheeſe, and ſtock fishe <note place="margin">Extreame neceſſititie and victualls vvounder full deere.</note> fayled, now they began moſt cruelly to enhance the price of meates. A pound of butter, was at halfe a crowne: a pot of oyle at ſix shillinges: an egge at three pence halfpeny: a <note place="margin">Greate diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> meaſure of peaſe, three pound. a pound of Bacon, eightee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne pence. which dearth of victualls, the ſoilderes impatient of want, draue them to the diſmall eating of dead bodies <note place="margin">Aſiſtance of the cittiſens.</note> others for the moſt part by the vſe of vnaccuſtomed mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, became (as the Phiſitians call it) full of ſcurffe. for being wearied with all ſorts of euills, afflicted with a gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous plague, were nourished with ould and with ſtinking wheate, long before prouided againſt ſuch an accident. The cittiſens, as the labors of the ſoldiars, and aſſudietie of their watchinges did diminish, tooke vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to keepe the walles of the cittie, leauing the outward forrifications to the ſoldiars: from which worke none, albeit ould and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted, would admit diſpenſation.

Furthermore, acquitting

               <p>Then the Captaines exhorted them, the preachers of the wourd out of their pulpits, beſought them for Gods ſake, that they would not grow faint harted, nor by the baſe tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le of rendring, to ſubmit them ſelfes to the filthie ſeruitude of the Spaniard, that they should nothing dout of the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Mansfelds coming: becauſe he ſeemed not to be <note place="margin">The Captai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes procured to animate the ſoldiars</note> preſent at the day appointed, that therfore they were decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: that he was nerer at hand, then they thought, but that the meſſages could not be brought, be reaſon that all paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were ſtopped.

VVhich thinges being ſaied, the Captaines, leaſt they should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced of lying by the beſieged, or that the miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the cittie being ſeene and vnderſtood, should be brought vnto us by the report of the conuoyes, decreed that no Trumpeters or drummers ſent by us, should fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence fourt be admitted within the walles, but should expect their anſwer without: and here by the councell of manlianus, they should be intertained honorably and liberally, to boaſt of the aboundance of their victualls.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrates alſo, looking into euery thinge, forbid the confraternities of the cittieſen of all aſſemblies after the example of Auguſtus, leaſt they should enter into factions,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7366:70"/>
vnder the title of a colledge, in the knot of ſome wicked fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The ſoldiars alſo were watched of the Captaines, as often as many walked about, and by their preſence, the coniurations of thoſe that walked, were preuented. VVith theſe and the like remedies, was the cittie, in perill, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and the languishing mindes of the cittiſens, and of the ſoldiards, ſuſtained when they held up their neceſſities by only hope.</p>
               <p>Now at lenght, Mansfeld with his companies of foote, approached by ſea vnto Gittrenbergue, when heauen was <note place="margin">The miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance of Manifeld in his naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</note> once againe ſeene to fight againſt him. For the windes did ſo beate the arriued nauie, one againſt the other that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ships being broken, did ſerue for nothing: then, as if all the cold of the winter had bene reſerued for that time all the riuers were shut up with a ſudaine froſt, that prouiſion could no longer be carried to them. It is the cuſtome of thoſe of Gittenbergue, to keepe at home litle prouiſion, upon the confidence of continuall naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and of the neighbouring places. Hence by the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuall af ſo great a companie of ſoldiars, there was ſmale prouiſion of meate for all them, the froſt forbiding to bring in new.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, what with plague, with agues, with the ſea, and with vomiting, by reaſon of their long shutting up in the ships with the narrownes of the roome, and many fild <note place="margin">Their nevv and ravv ſouldiars en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured gteate miſeries.</note> with the filthie ſauor (being almoſt all raw ſoldiars, and vnaccuſtomed to tempeſts and ſtinckes, were caſt into the waues, ether dead, or halfe aliue.

But that which befell much more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, when Mansfeld durſt not ſet a shore thoſe whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wills he conſtrained to take their oathe, by the ſame remedie chiefly they dyed, by which they we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re kept, leaſt that they should runn away; to wit, enkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by that prohibition. Notwithſtanding, many beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them to vs by flight, vnarmed, ragged, preſented vs a patterne of the reſt, affirming them ſelues, to be in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fashion then the reſt, when almoſt all of them, were inuoluntarie, and vnexpert in war, that they were by and by taught how to handle their weapons, when they were to be led in to the field.

               <p>There were ſome, who beſought <hi>Spinola,</hi> that with the companies of Carolus Coloma, together with ſome of his companies adioyned, he would ſuffet Roſendale (litle for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to be aſſaulted.

               <p>In the fourth of the Nones of March, the aniuerſarie day of Breda, in times paſt taken by the vninted Peeres, by the fraud of a boate was changed. This day thoſe of Breda, <note place="margin">Solemnitie in Breda in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of the daie it vvas taken by the hollandes by fraude.</note> being wont yearly to ſolemniſe, now kept ſo much the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ren owmedly, by how much perhaps hereafter they dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to celebrate the ſame the more ſeldome, more truly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the maner of a ſolemne buriall, then a birth day. for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging thrice towards the euening, all their greater and leſſer Canons, they conſecrated the laſt night to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie therof.</p>
               <p>Now the time was come, in which the intermitted affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me to be made in the riuer, was renewed. That interualle of time, wherin the mariners and the workmen deſiſted from their labors, had rouſed vp the ſtudies of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry perſons.

The affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſeemed to ſucced better then it did before, when by a

ſudden alteration of the heauens, ſo great force afwater on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce againe by the ouer-flowing of the Moone of March (in which the ſea then moſt of all doth ſwell) was ſtirred vpon high, and ſo great a deluge of rayne and vnthawed ſnow, flowed together on euery ſide, that the damme begun at Seuenbergue, and very many forts of Roſen dale, and ſome part of the ſuburbs of the cittie of Breda, were altogether ouer-turned. The wayes alſo to our campes, and ſome of our fortifications neere to the cittie, were ſo drowned, that <note place="margin">The vvaters did ouerflovv the camps.</note> they could, for three dayes be gone vnto not but by cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boates in which time one campe being shut from another they were in great neceſſititie of victualls, when they could <note place="margin">No ſmale dammage don vnto our quarters.</note> not go to one another with their wagons, nor was there meanes to haue ſo great a ſupply of boates: the riuer, the shore, and the fieldes being all alike.</p>
               <p>Neuer could it otherwiſe haue bene more clearly kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, by how great mercie of God, the armie was conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <note place="margin">Greate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of god.</note> the whole winter: for if the ſame extremitie of winter time, and aboundance of ſnow (which fell in this short ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of the winters departure) had hapned in the former monthes (as at other times it was wont to do) out of dout, we should haue bene forced to forſake the ſiege, for no other cauſe then only for the sharpnes of the weather: for in thoſe few dayes, wherein it freeſed ſo ſeuerely, the ſinnewes of many were shrunke vp by the force of the cold, and ſome amongſt the watches, were found dead, Some had their handes and feete ſo ſtiff, that they were faine to haue them ſawed of.

               <p>The waters being diminished, the enimies endeuours attempted againe, with great ſolicitude of minde, to finish the pretented damme. <hi>Spinola</hi> cauſed the ſluce of the riuer of Leure (which reached vnto the riuer of Merka) to be broken a ſunder, and comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded certaine riuers to be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and diuerted, which poured them ſelues abroad into our campes.

               <p>That he reioyced much, to haue receiued letters thrice from Maurice, by which he vnderſtood, both that Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feld was ſafely arriued with German and English ſuccours, and ſo great warlike preparations to be made, for the relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Breda. That he should be carefull, as he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that there should be corne enough till the end of Aprill or begining of May, vnles it should by chance be burnt by fire, which the enimies often shot into the cittie. That he would shortly finde out new inuentions for corne, by ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the granaries of the cittiſens. That the workes of the enimies, ar lately extended from the great trench, which lay before the water mille, to the campes of Balanconius, and placed againſt the litle tree of Guittenbergue. Thoſe campes began to be fortified with workes by <hi>Spinola.</hi> The gariſon of the ciitie was daylie very much diminished

That the rape-oyle, was alwayes firſt burnt, before it was applied to dreſſe meate with; but that there was but litle left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spinola</hi> hauing read them, and ſealing them ſendes them by the ſame meſſenger, promiſing the fellow a liberall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, if he brought anſwer from Maurice, and from Manſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feld vnto him. Maurice ſuppoſing that he might ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly credit the meſſenger, by whome (with ſo great fidelity) he had receiued iuſtinus letters, giueth both anſwer, and a reward for the fellowes paines, and ſendes him to Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feld, to receiue alſo letters from him.</p>

               <p>In thoſe letters Maurice purgeth him ſelfe of his ſtay, and impoſeth the cauſe of the prolonging of ſupplies, upon the contrary tempeſts of the yeare; beſeeching him that he would endeuour to prolong the victualls ſome weekes by ſparingnes, but vnto the end of Aprill: that he had neede of ſo much time, to gather and to ioyne his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers together, that otherwiſe ſo extraordinarie charges of the vnited Lords, shoulde be to no purpoſe, and their endeuours all in vaine. That theſe, indeed, were hard de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandes, but that fortune muſt be now holpen by indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie, eſpecially ſeeing all the French horſe gathered by Mansfeld (two only companies deſired, which weare daylie expected) was now come to Bullen, and to that end, the ships of the States ar gone to tranſport them by a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous winde. That the French companies of footepart were brought by Captaine Candale, part were in the way, as the other companies were both of horſe and foote, gathered

thorough Germaine for the States. Laſtly, the Frenche, Englishe, and German ſupplies, were to come but a litle after that time, which he would haue prolonged by him till after Aprill.</p>
               <p>Mansfeld promiſed that he would shortly be Iuſtinus gueſt: that then he would merrely drink his and his valiant companions health; That he was come, prepared with a hundred companies of foote, and fortie of horſe, nor dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing of ſupplies.</p>

               <p>For this purpoſe he ſendes the Trumpeter of Count Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lazarius with his letters priuily.

of victualls augmented by the death of ſo many men, thus made anſwer.</p>
               <p>That he was amaſed, hauing read <hi>Spinolaes</hi> letters, and al his ſo ſtrange demandes: but ſo much the more, becauſe he thought that he and ſo many valiant companions of his, could be made afraidwith wordes; to whom he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that nothing could happen to be feared, except it were a baſe report.

               <p>
                  <hi>Spinola</hi> (leaſt the minde of the wearied ſoldiar should wax faint, by the inſolent braging of the beſieged, which aſſumed to them ſo great courage) prudently ſuppreſt that anſwer in dead ſilence. VVhich was enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the shortnes of the remainder of the labor vnto the ſoldiar, it was commonly gathered by ſuſpicions, that a Trumpeter was ſent to luſtine out of the campe, touching the rendring of the cittie, as many did coniecture wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, albeit many fayned reports, and added ſome fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of their owne, to that which they had heard from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when they vnderſtood thoſe hopes of <hi>Spinola</hi> to be deceiued, or deferred any longer.

In that interuall of time, on which holli dayes were made for Maurice, and in which a new Commander was appointed for the armie, many of our Prouinciall companies, wearie of the war, departed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me from their ſtanding places; alſo not a few of the ancient horſmen, diſguſted with the hardnes of the war, for the te diouſnes of expecting their wages, forſooke their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. So the French daylie in greater number, came vnto us in great troupes from Mansfelds armie, complayning <note place="margin">Sedicion in the quarters of Mansfelt.</note> that they were coſoned by him with hope of aſſaulting the Palatinat, nor in ſeauen monthes ſpace, had receiued ſo much as one penny. Some of theſe mens voices were there plainly heard to ſay, that they would not goe againſt <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis Spinolaes</hi> armie if in caſe they should be led. A young Frenchman, by trade a Pothegarie, apprehended in Mansfelds campe, being to haue ſolicited ſome of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citiſens to runne away, tyed vnto ſwift horſes, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in peeces, gaue up the ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Our ſoldiars at Breda, ſpeaking with the beſieged out of the watch, made a coueant, that no peece should be shot in the meane while, (ſo that of two armies, one ſeemed now to be made) afterwards flooted one another.

Scarce four dayes after, when <hi>Spinola</hi> to diſcouer places, ſitting upon a white horſe, rode nere vnto the cittie, the balle of a great Canon, broke the bridle vnder his horſes mouth, leauing the raynes in his hand: that it is to be beleeued, that ether the chiefe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of war, ar in a morce ſecure protection of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, or by how the leſſe any one ſpareth him ſelfe in battaile, ſeemeth to be ſo much more the ſafer.</p>

Being awakened, he looked with ſuch liuelie eyes, he liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſo attentiue a minde, that he ſeemed not to haue ſſept at all: and he as ſoone recouered his ſleepe, as he was awaked, ſo ſecurely ſlept he, all his carees being ſo well huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded. In his apparell, he was negligent of all curiouſe trimming, and careleſſe of adorning him ſelfe, euen in the dignitie of a generall. Touching the crueltie of the ſeaſon, and the weather; and whether it rayned, or ſnowed, or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or blew, or wheter it were euening or midnight, he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not. He often times ſuſtained hungar, two dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. His bed, was often in his coache, or in the poore cotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of ſome ſoldiar. He made no account of his meate, of his reſt, nor of his owne body. The burthen of his waighty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, was perpetuall, and his labor aboue al beliefe. His minde was a conqueror of al difficulties, as his countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce almoſt the ſame, in aduerſitie and proſperitie, in whoſe peaceable mirth, the hope of the ſoldiar might reſt, ſecure his councells he nether approued in his owne opinion, nor communicated them, but where it was neceſſarie. Not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected upon a ſodaine, but by ſuch as were made ſtrong, by long delay. He was of ſingular ſilence. His beleuing of new aduices, together with his diſtruſting of them, and as well his ſlow creduIitie, as his ready contempt of heauie rumors. To prouide for, to conſult, write, heare, command, to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the campes, was like vnto a daylie paſtime. Neuer did he pretend any excuſe for his wearines; neuer forbid acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe vnto him.

He congratulated him, with a feſtiuall ſound of all the canons, and with the other applauſes of militarie ioy. After on other dayes, being led about all the workes, he much admired the greatnes and ſtrenght of the ſiege. He related, that the Kinge of France ſaid vnto him (by whom he paſſed as he returned) he could not beleeue, that Breda would be taken by <hi>Spinola</hi> by that ſiege: yet at that time ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">The Kinge of France is opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion touc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinge this ſiedge.</note> thinges promiſed vs a fortunat ſucceſſe of that ſiege, as, the continuall flight of the french from Mansfeld, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay in releeuing the enimie, the ſcarcetie of victualls within the cittie, the conflicts of the beſeeged with ſickneſſes, ſo great a dearth of medicaments, that of the Tobacco that <note place="margin">Tobaco vvas vvounder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dere.</note> was brought, although elſe where it coſt but four crownes a pound was ſould in the cittie for twentie pounds, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy they vſed againſt the ſcuruey: beſides that ſpace of dayes, aboue ſix hundred horſe were driuen from the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies campes, being ill looked vnto, as they graſed.</p>

be abſent from his companie. Moreouer, that he should place very far off from the campe, the ſtanding place of the centeries. Next, that ſome watchers, should goe a good ſpace from the ſtanding place before the companie.
