            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
DEDICATION
To his Honoured TUTOR,
WILLIAM GOULD, M. D.
Late Fellow of Wadham-Colledge, Oxon.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE only Relation that drew me to preſume of fixing
your Name to this Diſcourſe, was that of a Scholar
to his Maſter, when I had formerly the Happineſs
of being under your Inſpection, in order to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Natural Reaſon ripened and mellowed by ſome artificial Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements.
The Experience I had then of your Candor, gives
me now juſt Encouragement to hope, that in offering theſe Papers,
which are the firſt Fruits of my enquiry yet abroad, I preſume not
amiſs. I had thoughts (having indeed brought it to ſome perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
of preſenting you with another thing, differing from this
both in Kind and Language, and by way of gratitude to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payed
it to one whom I eſteemed it beſt due; (from whom I had
diſtill'd on me thoſe kind and gentle Effuſions, at my firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity, and therefore have reaſon to deplore
nothing more, than my own voluntary and untimely departure
from their warmer Influence) but, <hi>Sir,</hi> as we breathe here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in a contigent Air, and are not quick-ſighted enough to pierce
through the Clouds of that Caliginous Night, under which all
Futurity lies obſcured and concealed, many unſought Accidents
may obtrude themſelves on us; and when they come, inſtead of
giving us a Diverſion, they are then as unwelcome, as before
<pb facs="tcp:33653:3"/>
they were unthought of. And while a Man is detained under the
ſevere Diſcipline of ſome dark Providence, there is nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to clear up, and ſoften his Diſpoſition, than mildly to impart
to another what is at preſent ſo great a Burthen to himſelf;<note place="margin">Animum ſcribendo lenire, <hi>Eraſm.</hi>
               </note> as
when the Stream ſwells, and threatens the adjoyning Bank, it
receives a ſudden check through the conveyance of ſome hidden
Sluce. But I hope you will not think (moſt Courteous <hi>Mecae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas)</hi>
as I am not ſo vain to imagine, That this mean Preſent is
ſufficient to diſengage me from thoſe higher Obligations, whereby
I ſhall ever ſtand indebted to you. I have only this to beg, that
you would Honour me with ſome part of your good Eſteem; and
in the mean time accept of theſe juvenile Productions, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Teſtimony of that Reſpect which is ſtill owing, till you are
gratified with the compleater Iſſue of a more improved Ability.
And while I addreſs to you, if you retain your wonted Candor,
(as I have no reaſon to ſuſpect the contrary) I need not doubt
of your Generous Condeſcention; but am ſtill perſwaded to hope,
that the height your great Abilities and Diſquiſitions have raiſed
you to, is not above the Intreaties of a Client, but rather like
ſome fruitful Limb of Nature, you will bend the lower for being
well laden. And being thus encouraged, while I ſtudy for a clear
diſcharge at my preſent Poſt, I ſhall not forget to approve my
ſelf,</p>

Epiſtle to the READER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE following Treatiſe would gladly entitle it ſelf to thy
acceptance. But if the Author may not be ſo happy in
the general, he is ſure of ſome particular friends, and
thoſe of no mean rank, who have given it a kind enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
beyond what was expected, and with whoſe
approbation it comes abroad: And if but one perſon more be either
bettered, or relieved hereby, he thinks himſelf abundantly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced
in the enquiry. Be not ſwift to cenſure, 'tis a ſubject very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common.
And the innocency, the Author hopes, in expoſing what
is written to the publick, will (withal conſidering the unpleaſantneſs
of the undertaking) prevent in others all thoughts of glory and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
in the publiſher. Beſides, 'tis well known, this man is not ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
as to detect what that mans apprehenſions of things are:
'Tis a kind of Sagacity we muſt confeſs we all fall ſhort of. The
truth is, we are not ſo much concerned at him, who ends his life in
a free and natural courſe, and in an even pace walks off to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Dead; for why, 'tis the common Road of Mankind; but
for a man to break up the door of Nature, and with rude hands to
thruſt himſelf out of the world; for a man to hurry himſelf on all
the unknown hazards of Self-violence, you will ſay this is a very
quaint undertaking.</p>
            <q>
               <l>—Quis talia fando</l>
               <l>Temperet à Lachrymis?</l>
            </q>
            <p>Thrice curſed be the fatal inſtrument that ſhall ever be acceſſary to
ſo unfortunate an attempt.</p>
            <p>Now what account can be given of an Adventure ſo prepoſterous
and amazing? There are, 'tis confeſſed, different Scenes of this kind.
Some by their own faſt and immoderate walking, are ſeen to ſhake
the ſands of life, and to breed a confuſion in their current. Some
men, ſcorn makes deſperate; others are ſighing, and ſhortening their
hours under the falſe wheadles of ſome ſofter paſſion. But now for a
man that values not the one, and has outlived the follies of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:33653:4"/>
and is indifferently careful not to charge himſelf beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
for one that is placed under the handſomeſt circumſtances of
content imaginable, bleſſed with a competent ſupport, cheared with
an acceptable Relation, and wanting nothing but a quiet mind to
Crown himſelf in the free Empire of his own Enjoyment, for ſuch a
one to become his own dire Executioner, and to be the firſt in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away the Sacred breath, this laſt indeed gives me leave to gueſs
ſomewhat in a Theory otherwiſe ſo unaccountable.</p>
            <p>'Twas the Obſervation of a great man to this effect,<note place="margin">Biſhop <hi>Hopkins.</hi>
               </note> Diſcontent
is not ſeated in our Wants, but Deſires. There is ſcarce any conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the world ſo low, but may ſatisfie our wants; and there is no
condition ſo high as can reach our Deſires.</p>
            <q>Quod ſatiare poteſt dives Natura miniſtrat.</q>
            <p>If we live according to the Law of Nature and Reaſon, we ſhall
never be poor; but if we live according to fond opinion and fancy,
we ſhall never be rich.</p>
            <p>A diſcontented man to me is the wonder of Nature. He would
fain conceal his mind, and yet at the ſame time takes the beſt care
to expoſe his miſery. I am apt to think, that Melancholy is not the
firſt thing that attacks Mankind, but that diſcontent is at once both
the Parent and Nurſe of ſo deformed an off-ſpring; and being not
able to bear up with that uſual vigor and ſharpneſs, at length tires,
and decays through a long fatigue. And all this while the ſubject is
ripening apace for ſome deſperate deſign; and no doubt too (as we
never want the latent attendance of an evil Geni, <hi>Smith</hi>'s <hi>Sel. Diſc.)</hi>
there is ſome active Impreſſor from without that ſets forward the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and having uſed his utmoſt effort, the party is prevailed on
at length, and away muſt he be hurried in a ſtream of Self-violence.
Hell and horror! a man muſt be ſtrangely wrought on to act thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the common meaſures of Humanity. Reaſon muſt be ſorrily baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled;
and it can ſcarce be conceived of any, unleſs one lately retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from the Paſtures of <hi>Abdera,</hi> where he has ſucked in madneſs
with his very diet. It muſt be ſure when the Brute extinguiſhes the
Man, and all the calmer notions are betrayed and gone, before he can
be brought over to ſo unnatural a compliance, fancy muſt needs run
low, and reaſon be retired to its cold harbour, before ſuch a kind of
Lethargy can ſeize on the maſs of Being, and a man be forced to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
himſelf from the friendly Light. Fie! Melancholy to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree!
'tis beneath the ſcorn of men, and the juſter harmony of a
<pb facs="tcp:33653:4"/>
more ſetled Imagination. I defie that dull Meteor raiſed from your
earthly ſelf, that impure ſteam which one bright hour can eaſily ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and having chaſed away the darker anguiſh, can command the
riſing Sun to ſmile forth a happy day. Well, ſuppoſe the worſt, the
day had been ſomewhat obſcurer than ordinary, and the faint light
ſeemed to vibrate and depart, is there not a warm Interval that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matches
the rougher ſeaſon? Will it ſtill be Winter? Does not the
gay Spring mend up whatever ſeverity went before, recommending
it with a more chearful acceptance?</p>
            <p>Why ſhould we attempt to remove the Landmarks of Nature, and
think to adjuſt the periods of time according to the meaſures of our
own diſtracted fancy? Or at leaſt, are we ſuch unskilful Artiſts, that
we can't trim the Lamp, unleſs we wholly extinguiſh the Light?
Would you perſwade the Lutaniſt to burſt the ſtring, becauſe the
Inſtrument is at preſent out of tune? Muſt the Jewel periſh, becauſe
the Caſe is a little diſordered? If a man murders another, the horror
of the fact may be ſomewhat mitigated before his departure into the
everlaſting Scene of uncertainty, and a gentle recantation may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe
betwixt the cenſure of the Crime, and the execution of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;
but for a man to be a Suicide, for that Royal Creature to be
the Regicide of himſelf, and to fall a Sacrifice to the flames of his
own revenge, this is a ſad revolution indeed. And though 'tis not our
part to judge, yet we may have the liberty to fear his future diſpoſal;
for he is gone without a Pſalm of mercy, and had no <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
to refreſh him in his laſt Agony. When a good man departs the Stage,
like the Sun you may trace his glory at his ſetting, and the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Croud ſurrounding, may be cheared at the brightneſs of the ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
flaſh. Happy day! whenever I expire, and it be my good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to have pale death ſit triumphant on the hollow Cheek, inſtead
of parting in the dumb pomp of confuſion, may I beg the boon to go
off civilly from the Body; and whoever departs otherwiſe, I wiſh
that unbleſt <hi>terrors</hi> may not for ever haunt his trembling ſhadow.</p>

intrinſical to the rational nature: there are ſome radical principles
that are ſweetly tempered with the Immortal breath, and do ſhew
themſelves forth in this happy Compound, to countermand which,
ſhould there come one from the Angelick Order, tho we will be more
civil than to pronounce him accurſed, yet ſo far we may ſafely aver,
That we are not bound to believe him.</p>
               <p>There is ſome grand dictate lodged in the Center of the Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33653:6"/>
Being, which a Heathen called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſomething that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
aſſociates with it, and is as 'twere the main artery from
whence ſpring all the leſſer branches of the Natural Law. We know
not how to Character it, but we are ſenſible enough of the effect. The
<hi>Malum fugiendum,</hi> the <hi>Beatitudo quaerenda,</hi> and ſuch like, are all of its
own l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> hence 'tis that they appear in the vigor and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a Law. Amongſt all the very firſt, and that which is certainly
mingled with humanity, and lies no doubt at the very root and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of being, is the deſire of preſervation in order to happineſs.
Now this ſweet paſſion, Deſire, is ſeldom without a companion; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Fear, which is a paſſion ſomewhat more violent, according to the
apprehenſions of the Object, and lies deep in the nature of man; for
at the ſame time that we are in the very fervor and ſtretch of incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
there is ſome kind of quivering, and concernedneſs, leſt
we ſhould fall ſhort in the purſuit, This, I ſay, is a thing very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
with our Complexions, and flows immediately from the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
Principle, Preſervation: <q>For every one deſires his own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
and happineſs; and therefore hath a natural dread and
horror of every thing that can deſtroy his Being, or endanger his
happineſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now it can't be denied, but irrationals too do partake of this
common property (if I may ſo ſpeak) with humanity. Every thing
in nature ſtruggles for the conſervation of its Being, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of its perfective acquirement. And the ſmalleſt crumb of
Entity has ſomething of care and ſelf-intereſt in it. Touch but the
honey, which is the life of the labouring Bee, and preſently he puts
you off with a ſting. All Corporeals are ſeen to fly whatever is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
to their own forms, and to embrace all the neighbourly and
friendly Beings, that will in the leaſt offer to cloſe, and comply with
them. Obſerve the Brutal conduct, though it wants the contrivance
of a more ſubſtantial judgment, yet it has ſo much of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
which a Philoſopher renders <hi>Virtutum Simulachra,</hi> ſome imperfect
draughts of the Moral Nature, whereby they are well enough fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
in their Wilder Politicks to be very tender of their own ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Shew me a Being, if you can, that would not fain be centering
it ſelf in the boſom of happineſs, and doing all that is poſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
and amplifie its exiſtence. And though we can't ſuppoſe theſe
Irrationals ſo unblemiſhed amidſt their converſation of ſenſe, as if
they dreſſed themſelves by the Glaſs of a Law; yet they are ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to their Inclinations, and careful to preſerve the Seal of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33653:6"/>
unbroken, that they rarely miſcarry upon this account. If you
regard Inanimates, take a ſtone that is artificially lodged upon the
top of a Tower, and you ſha'nt find it inclined to diſmount it ſelf
(though indeed there is a great deal of reaſon for it) till it be looſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by ſome external violence, and then it muſt of neceſſity drop to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Center. This is a thing methings as improper to conceive,
as for a Brute to become a <hi>felo de ſe.</hi> So that every Being is kind and
courteous to it ſelf to this degree, as not to abandon what is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
to its own conſervation; but takes all the care, and delight ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
to carry on its own welfare and complacency.</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as they call
it, a Sacred kind of Manuſcript Engraven by the finger of the
Deity. 'Twas the Suprem'ſt Opifex that gave right Reaſon in Man,
its firſt <hi>Imprimatur;</hi> and an Eternal Contriver that carved it on the
fair Table of an Immortal mind. Now for what end ſhall we imagin
there was ſo much care taken about it? we can't ſuppoſe it to be fixed
there as an empty Cypher, but rather as ſome hidden Monitor,
which now and then ſteps up in the name of Authority, and warns
men to ſhun ſuch irregular and undue courſes as bear an implacable
enmity towards their Natures, and to adviſe them to embrace ſuch
comely Objects, as ſhall enable the more exalted Power. In a word,
'tis all for advancing the Rational make to the juſt perfection of its
Being.<note place="margin">Ariſtotle.</note> 'Twas by virtue of this, that the great Philoſopher came to
diſcern the Immortal Seal that was ſtamped on his very Being, and
at laſt throughly underſtood by the right trimming and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Intellectual Lamp, that he muſt once, as himſelf confeſt,
be accountable for his Being, and all its operations to his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as
he called him.</p>
               <p>This is but a fair and judicious conſtruction of things; for we can't
otherwiſe imagin, but that as this engraved Law was diſpenſed to
every man according to the Oeconomy of Infinite Wiſdom; ſo every
violation of this Law is not only prejudicial to the Being of man, but
a virtual contempt of the Supreme Legiſlator; who having all Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Love and Goodneſs, contempered in his nature, was moved
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33653:7"/>
hereby to oblige mankind to be ſtudious and provident of its own
happineſs. So much then as a man revolts from the dictates of right
Reaſon, and is inobſequious to this implanted Law, to ſo much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
and animadverſion does he juſtly expoſe himſelf. And the very
rays of Light within, will reflect on him ſuch a diſcovery, that a Being
eſſentially depending on another, muſt certainly by reſponſible to it,
and without all queſtion cenſured for the breach of ſo clear and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
a conſtitution. And as for the Supreme Judge, the meaſure
of his proceedings may be collected from the harmony of his temper,
who is ſo juſt that he cannot, and ſo good that he will not inflict his
cenſures beyond the merits of the Crime.</p>
               <p>Now all this being ſo far granted,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>
                  </note> we are yet farther to ſuppoſe,
that this Natural Light, which all hold to be the glitterings of ſome
uncreated <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay on the Immortal Mind, is ſtill making freſh diſcoveries,
but eſpecially recommends that which moſtly tends to the ſafety and
conſervation of the Rational compound; for this grand affair the
firſt Author deſigned Right Reaſon, when he took the primeſt and
moſt ſelect part of it, and Enacted it into a Law. And this is ſo
much the aim and tendency of it, that no Created Power can diſpenſe
or divert it to any other end. For a Law thus founded, remains irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſible,
and none can annul it; but that very Legiſlative power, who
firſt framed it into Being. A Law that has ſo Divine an Original, can
by no means be diſpenſed withal, unleſs by a power equal to the
ſame, or ſuperior to that which made the Sanction. Indeed this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Power, we confeſs, may, as he thinks fit, alter, but will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
totally extinguiſh the Natural Law. For why, as Divines hold,
'tis that Conſtitution by which the Heathen world ſhall be arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and cenſured at the General Audit.</p>
               <p>Now this Natural Law of which we are ſpeaking, is of that Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
extent both in reſpect of time and place, that no perſon could,
or ever can plead an exemption from the ſtrict obligation of it. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
no better Author than <hi>Cicero</hi> to confirm the truth of this Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
—<hi>Legi naturali nec propagari, nec derogari fas eſt.—Nec veró
aut per Senatum, aut per populum ſolvi hâc Lege poſſumus.—Non erat alia
Roma, alia Athenis, alia nunc alia poſt hac; ſed &amp; omnes gentes, omni
tempore, una lex, &amp; ſempiterna &amp; immutabilis continebit.—Cui qui non
parebit, ipſe ſe fugiet, &amp; naturam hominis aspernabitur.</hi> Here is a clear
and forcible intimation, that no perſon living can be excuſed from
the dictates of this Law, unleſs he will ſuffer himſelf to be as 'twere
baniſhed from his own eſſence, and live disjointed from humanity it
ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:33653:7"/>
He further ſays, which is a moſt convincing thing to all that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template,
That this Law is ſufficient to carry on great Exploits, were
there no other. <hi>Nec ſi regnante Tarquinio nulla erat ſcripta Lex de
ſtupris,</hi> &amp;c. <q>Suppoſe there were no poſitive Law for the preſent to
check the unruly Violence of a <hi>Tarquin;</hi> yet let him conſider that
Virgin-law of Nature, which he hath raviſhed and deflower'd;
what beamings of the Eternal Light, enough to revive a modeſt
<hi>Lucretia,</hi> he hath quenched, and ſo ſtrike a terror into the heart of
ſo licentious a Prince.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, with reſpect to the preſent Inſtance, were there no ſuch
Regal Order as this erected in the Empire of Man, did you ſpring into
being like one of Natures productions, or like ſome artificial <hi>Automa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
had been the principle of your own Motion? Or had you come
hither in that manner, for maintaining of which, <hi>Plato,</hi> who Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophizing
after a more refined way, rebuked ſeveral of his Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries,
and almoſt at that time of day droll'd the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> out of
the World, as if the Government of it had reſided wholly in the
Hands of blind Chance; had it been any of theſe, the Caſe had
been otherwiſe, and you might haply been at your own diſpoſal.
But ſeeing you are to pay deference to theſe ſacred Engravements
within you, ſeeing you are to bring in a conſtant Homage, for fear
you ſhould be branded with the ill Name of being a Rebel to Nature,
you are in no wiſe to meddle with a Prerogative ſo far beyond you.
Beſides, ſeeing every Man has his own Authority circumſcribed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws of that juſt Imperium within him, I make no
queſtion but that every Oppoſition carries with it the force of its own
Penalty. This appeared in the braver Heathen, who ſpake in this
manner, That when Goodneſs was an abundant Compenſation to it
ſelf, the very baſeneſs of ſuch an Action was puniſhment ſufficient.
And indeed, who cannot almoſt but be ſenſible, that as ſome good
has in it ſuch a native Fairneſs, ſuch a magnetick Virtue, as muſt
needs, were there no Command, invite and attract the Rational
Nature, and infallibly win upon the ſcore of its own Worth; ſo
there is ſuch a horrid Deformity in ſome Evil, as that Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
muſt needs loath and abhor it. Inſomuch, were all Laws laid
aſide, yet there would be ſome Order ſpringing from the Harmonies
of Reaſon, whereby the Rational Inclination would be diſpoſed,
in regard to its own welfare, to twine, and claſp about that Good,
and to fly that Evil againſt which it has conceived ſo ſtrong a Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.
Now, as we are poſitively aſſured, That the grand Author
of Nature has not ſettered, or enſlaved the Rational Creature, but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33653:8"/>
rather graced it with a competent Enlargement; ſo we are equally
certain 'tis his mind, that it ſhould ſo far conſent to its own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and to all the means that are required to conſerve it, as haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſhun, and abhor whatever is deſtructive and prejudicial to its
ſecurity. And I doubt not to aver from hence, that 'tis according
to the Univerſal Policy of Nature for a Man to regard his own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Tillot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
                  </note>
For as a Reverend Divine of our own ſpeaks, He is not a

Title of Wiſdom. And as Self-preſervation is the firſt Principle of

Rage, which they would gladly avoid, and are begging the
courteous Retirement of any ſolitary Grot to conceal them till the

here? This is what the Hiſtorian is pleaſed to call the preferring an
honourable Death, before the baſe Reproaches of an ignominious
Life. But then he ſeems to ſenſe it in this manner, when admiring
him for his Valour,<note place="margin">Joſeph. Ant l. 15.</note> concludes for his Honour, that 'twas as great as

ſaid to tolerate this Life for a certain ſeaſon, as a neceſſary Office of
Nature, tho much againſt their Inclinations; yet do they haſten,
tho not urged to it by any Calamity, to unfetter themſelves of the
Bonds of Mortality, only out of a pure deſire of immortal Freedom.
And here, which we may moſt of all admire, when they made
known their aim, none ſtrived to divert, or diſſwade them from

which that unhappy Author at another place is pleaſed to call
a devout Violence; and as if he attempted with all the ſtrength

to encourage Self-homicide; he ſtiles it the ſweetneſs of Dying.
And further, to ſet it forth in all its Solemnity, eſpecially at

               <p>But of all the Inducements whereby Men may be driven on ſuch
a fatal hazard, deep Melancholly is a thing of a very odd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
and which looks oftentimes this way. But then, without
all doubt, 'tis an Error juſtly cenſurable for any Man to let it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
to that degree. And tho a Man were as diſordered in his mind,
as <hi>Therſites</hi> was in his Body, yet there are unqueſtionably ſuch means
to be uſed, as will in ſome meaſure reſtore him to a regular frame.
And ſeeing a bodily Diſpoſition has ſo much influence on the Mind,
thoſe noble Counſellors to Nature, that are daily ſeen to heal the
one, may in ſome remoter ſenſe be ſaid to cure the languors of the

                  <hi>Hominum Carnificina;</hi> and if there be a
Hell upon Earth, 'tis certainly within the Center of a melancholly
Mind. I can't but think, a Man in this Caſe beyond a common
<hi>Prometheus,</hi> in whoſe Bowels ſwarms of Vultures lodge themſelves,
and a whole herd of Scorpions continually revel within; and here
all his future Sorrow is owing to his preſent Miſconceptions. In
precipitating his end, he fondly imagines, that he is paſſing to a

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:33653:10"/>
all Griefs and Diſcontents will be buried in the black
<hi>Euripus</hi> of this Self-contrivance. Therefore the uſual Inſtances in
which Men ſhift themſelves on this odd kind of Tryal, are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to be Sorrow, Fury, Fear, Deſpair, ſome internal Anguiſh
and Remorſe; which make them eſteem the Halter of <hi>Timon,</hi> or the
Dagger of <hi>Lucretia,</hi> their beſt <hi>Aſilum.</hi> And thereupon are ready to kiſs
the Executioner, and to bleſs the Sacred Engine that appears for their
Deliverance. Their Life is a burthen, they curſe their Enemies, and
murmur at their Friends; ſcarce any Application that can ſatisfy, or
calm the buſy Terror.</p>
               <p>Hell and Confuſion! In the day-time, how do ſome dire preſages
(on which they are moſt intent, even when they would not be) of
Shame, and Anguiſh, ſcare and appale the fainting Geni! In the
night-time, when they would fain repoſe, being gazed on by the
broken Images of Sleep; how do the bold Ideas, as ſoon as gentle
<hi>Morpheus</hi> has cloſed the tender Lid, and given a ſoft <hi>Item</hi> of Slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
obtrude themſelves, and triumph on the State of Fancy? How
do the Vauits ſeem fill'd with unuſual Screams, thin Sounds, hollow
and diſmal Groans, and juſt flaſhing ope the Lid, ſhall catch at the
trembling Eccho? Where could the Party in this Caſe ſhift himſelf
for eaſe, and court releaſe in any figure? Whither could he fly to
be reconciled to himſelf? To ſome caved Mountain, and there beg
the yielding Roof to redouble his moans; to ſome ſoft Stream, and
there intreat the buſy Noiſe to divulge his concern, and chant
forth his Sorrow as it goes to the pitying Conſort of the Air. And
now the critical Moment draws on; in this ebb of Extremity, the
frightful Shade puts on a pleaſing Vizard, and appears to him <hi>ſub
umbra boni:</hi> And then he chides him for driving on the unhappy
day in ſo tedious a manner, and would fain have the Sun to ſet
at Noon; then 'tis, that he ſeems to invite and embrace the joyful
Shade with all the chear imaginable.—<hi>Sic ſic juvant ire ſub umbras.</hi>
No Objections will work on him, ſo furiouſly bent is he. He
drives on purpoſely to overthrow the Chariot, and cares not how
the World be ſcorched, ſo he becomes a <hi>Phaeton</hi> to himſelf, and
lies cruſh'd in the ſilent downfal. To what a ſtrang maze is he dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!
His caſe is hardly reaſonable, (as one excellently argues)
and therefore cannot fall under any certain Rules and Directions.
For they that are under the Power of Melancholly, are ſeldom
fit to take that Counſel, which alone is fit to be given them, and
that is, not to believe themſelves concerning themſelves, but to
truſt the Judgment of others, rather than their own Apprehenſions.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:33653:11"/>
In other Caſes,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Tillot.</hi> Vol. 2.</note> the ſame Author avers, Every Man knows himſelf
beſt, but a Melancholly Man is moſt in the dark as to himſelf. The
cauſe of his trouble is very much to be pitied, but hard to be removed;
unleſs by chance one may happen to ſpeak ſomewhat that may hit his
humour, and ſatisfy him for the preſent; but reaſon muſt needs ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
very little to thoſe Perſons, the Nature of whoſe Diſtemper is
to turn every thing that can be ſpoken for their comfort, into Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
againſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>A ſtrange Eclipſe indeed, and a direful Concluſion muſt needs
attend, when Men will be ſo induſtrious in oppoſing their own Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility!
when they had rather take ſpeedy Shelter in the horrors of
Night, than to wait the Glances of a more pleaſant Day, which
may dawn on them, if they will but acquieſce till the Storm is over,
and with calm leiſure expect the departing Courſe of ſo threatning
a Tide. But alas, they mind nothing more than a preſent diſpatch,
and all reaſonable Suggeſtions are loſt in the falſe Conception of
ſome calmer Seaſon of their own Contrivance. And thereupon
with greedy guſt they devour the luſcious <hi>Poppy;</hi> and out of a
broken thought to obtain, do furiouſly throw themſelves on the
hazard.</p>
               <p>Certainly there can be no aſſurance; and how men in this dark
Interval can be viſited with the ſweet gales of hope, is hard to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
There may be ſome buſie vapour (and we may gueſs from
whence 'tis exhaled) that may come and pretend to fan on the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
but in the end, it proves to be nothing but the filthy ſteamings
of ſome hideous fume within. And therefore 'tis a nice thought that
of Sir <hi>Tho. Moor</hi> in his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi> where ſpeaking of a voluntary death,
in caſe life it ſelf prove troubleſome, he ſays that a man may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
himſelf, <hi>bona ſpe fretus; acerbâ vitâ velut à carcere ſe eximat.</hi>
But I would fain know, whether a man ſhould not incur the cenſure
of the place, if he knocks off his ſhackles, and breaks priſon againſt
the conſent of the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>One of the moſt renowned among the Ancients undertakes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
a voluntary death no further than 'tis conſiſtent with a good
Cauſe.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>St.</hi> Aug.</note> If a man upon the ſcore of a publick adventure ruſhes into
eminent danger (as in the doubtful circumſtance of War) all the
dark thoughts of death are ſhadowed over, 'tis ſuppoſed on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of preſent magnanimity; and ſo there can be no ſuch thing as
wilful murder, if a man drops in the attempt. If a <hi>Sampſon</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
to others ſhall ſhake the Pillars of the World, and pull the
Globe about his ears, the end upon an extraordinary account may
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33653:11"/>
ſomewhat alleviate the undertaking. But here is the difference, when
a man is under no ſuch temptation, and has nothing offered him as a
recompence of ſome generous exploit; when a man ſhall leiſurely,
and ſtudiouſly contrive his end, and in ſpight of all perſwaſion throw
himſelf on the dangerous precipice of ſelf-murder; this is hardly to
be excuſed.</p>
               <p>In all Hiſtory you may ſcarce meet with ſuch another inſtance, as
that of <hi>Pomponius Atticus, Tully</hi>'s dear friend, a moſt vertuous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
Senator, who lying a long time incurably ſick, as he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
thought it more expedient to die, than any longer to live in
torment. And thereupon entred on a voluntary famine, and being
not moved with all the importunities of his weeping friends, <hi>Qui
oſculantes obſecrarent nè id, quod natura cogeret, ipſe acceleraret;</hi> with
a ſetled reſolution, intreated that they would rather approve of his
good intent, than in any wiſe dehort him from it. And being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
or at leaſt obſtinate till the laſt, he ſoon diſmiſſed the famiſhed
Ghoſt: <hi>Precéſque dorum taciturnâ ſuâ obſtinatione depreſſit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſonant to this we may eaſily ſhape in anſwer to the queſtion
that was once put by an old Comedian,<note place="margin">Plaut.</note> Whether he that gives an
Alms to a Beggar does ill, as knowing at the ſame time, that he does
what only tends to an adjournment of his miſery. Which Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Lactant. <hi>and</hi> Cypr.</note>
two of the Ancients, as I am informed, have taken pains to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute,
and branded with the odium of a deteſtable opinion. And no
man, I think, need torture himſelf with the thought of ſome inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
difficulty, either in this, or other caſes of this nature, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when he comes to conſider upon what foundation he is to reſt on;
and that he is not to crouch to a Stoical Paradox, or to pay a blind
obedience to any Pagan Poſition, as if he were in defiance of thoſe
noble, and more refined Principles, which are ſo ſurpaſſing, and far
beyond the weak reflections of that unſound Philoſophy, That for
the ſake of ſome future good a man may commit a preſent evil. They
that are to be ſwayed in a different manner from this, and have a
more ſetled baſis ro relye on, will not think it reaſonable to move in
ſo irregular a manner, or to have the ſway of their actions carried
on by the weight of ſuch an unfair bias.</p>
               <p>As for inſtance, He that will ſo far ſet his hand to the Seal of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as to pay a willing obedience to theſe refined dictates of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
will not change his Sentiments; and being as 'twere timorous of
his Security, as he will diſtruſt the Principle, ſo he will fear the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of Self-deſtruction in order to future preſervation. He will be
in doubt what kind of Invaſion will follow, when he has thus broken
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33653:12"/>
up the fence of Nature, and expoſed himſelf to ſuch a violent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road.
Further, he that thinks himſelf obliged by this Naturalty, to
render to each particular perſon, as he expects to be dealt with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
will upon this conſideration, That no perſon can be nearer to
him, than he is to himſelf, be forced to ſuſpect how he ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited,
in caſe he ſhould miſ-uſe himſelf at preſent in hope of ſome
future advantage that ſhall accrue thereby. For he has a greater
reaſon to fear, than one who lately ſetting aſide common honeſty
has to dread of having returned on himſelf what afore he ſo injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
offered to another. And if a man can't do himſelf Juſtice, we
can hardly think him in a poſſibility of doing that to another which
he is not capable of performing to himſelf. If he is out of love with
himſelf, we can hardly think him in charity with the reſt of mankind.
<hi>Qui ſibi nequam, cui bonus?</hi> If a man be naught for himſelf, 'tis much
to be ſuſpected, he will be hardly good for any body elſe. If to love
others, as I love my ſelf, be now the grand preſcript a foot; and if
the love to my friend be thought fit by the greateſt Artiſt to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
from this fair original my ſelf; if I abandon ſelf-affection, and
have no charity at home, how ſhall I do to exerciſe it abroad, and
be to others what I am not to my ſelf.</p>
               <p>Again further, I have two or three things more to offer. He that
deſtroys himſelf, beſides burſting aſunder all the bonds of nature, he
quite ſubverts the end of his being created; which is to live decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
under Government, and to pay that honour and ſubmiſſion which
is due to reſpective Authority, without which the preſent Pavement
on which we tread, would look like blood and confuſion, and become
a meer wild and ſanguinary deſert. Now if you regard the Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Power in a Kingdom, he that ſhall thus diſpoſe of himſelf, muſt
needs be look'd on as a horrid Uſurper, and fit to be cenſured as an
Aſſaſſine upon this account, Becauſe he invades that Power, which
none but the Supreme Magiſtrate, or his Delegate, is inveſted withal.</p>
               <p>I have heard ſome ſay (and again I am informed Caſuiſts are not
poſitive about it) that a condemned Criminal may,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Dr.</hi> Donn.</note> and muſt deſtroy
himſelf in obedience to the Magiſtrates command. I'le cenſure the
thing, but I am cautious of medling with the Authority; and ſhall
only ſay this, That the more moderate ſort of Heathens would never
allow that an offender, if death were the caſe, ſhould execute the
ſentence on himſelf; as well knowing that 'twas a dividing him from
that natural Right which obliged every man to preſerve himſelf in
being, as long as poſſibly he could.</p>
               <p>2. If you regard the Supremeſt Power over all the Kingdoms of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:33653:12"/>
the world, we had need invent names beyond Rebellion, Uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Diſobedience, to paint the Self-murderer in his proper Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.
He is a Rebel to the Grand Author of his Being, whom we
muſt ſuppoſe to be the Rector of the Univerſe, and by virtue of the
ſame, challenges a Propriety over his Subjects, which none durſt u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp,
or meddle with. Every one almoſt muſt needs imagine, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and the whole Syſteme of Rationals, there is ſome ſecret
Law or Obligation, as the reſult of that conſtant Communion, and
entercourſe that is betwixt them. Nay, we may not ſuppoſe of this
great Author himſelf, that he is ſo unlimited in his Legiſlative Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
as to act above the reſtraints of a Law; neither may we
ſay that he is abſolutely determined to act by a Law; but this we
may rather conclude with ſafety, that the rules whereby he governs
the world, are rather the Sacred Decrees of ſome Diviner Reaſon,
than the arbitrary productions of an abſolute will.</p>
               <p>Now as all Rationals are bound by that Law which is mingled as
'twere with their very frame, and ſeated in the Immortal Nature, to
render to this Univerſal Governour the conſtant tribute of their
lives, which ſeems to be due upon the very nature of the thing,
were there no extrinſick injunction, and to endeavour all the ways
they can to diſplay, and blazon the Glories of their Original; ſo are
they to do it in that manner he has deſigned, and in which he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to accept it. Well then, ſuppoſe a perſon that pretends to
never ſo great fidelity and ſubjection, and in making Proteſtations
how faithful he will be in ſerving this great Prince at a more exalted
Poſt, ſhall thereupon break through the confines of the body, hoping
to obtain his end; or ſhall, as in the different caſe of ſome hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
provoke his execution, being as 'twere elated with the Glories
of an affected Martyrdom; I am afraid, as the latter will be argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of a fond raſhneſs, ſo the former will be look'd on as a bold In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder,
and may be cenſured as a Rebel, to throng thus into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of Majeſty before he is called for.</p>
               <p>'Tis much to be doubted whether he will not be treated in a

whether he can bethink himſelf of any other reward beſides that of a
deſerter. Whoever acts thus indiſcreetly, can by no means warrant
his future ſecurity. Unthinking wretch! whoever thou art, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
thy Being at no better rate, and to throw it away in a manner
as uncertain, as 'tis worthleſs. If as that Divine Canon aſſures us,
ſelf-murderers are direct enemies to the work of Nature, what ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
can they make, who have been razing ſo noble a Pile? Ah,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:33653:13"/>
ſenſeleſs mortal! Art thou fitter to determine the periods of time,
than that extenſive Providence which was awake from everlaſting, and
had a vaſt number of Poſſibilities, ſtored up in his own unfathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
thought, and might as well have ſent thee forth the Sample of
ſome ill-ſhapen Idea, as have ſet on thee the kinder Impreſs of the

more skilful in fixing the Boundaries of Life, than that unerring
hand, which drew the ſeveral lineaments of being, ere they appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the curious proportion we now behold them.</p>
               <p>Again <hi>3ly,</hi> Suppoſe a man had no regard to a temporal reſtraint,
and would not think fit to be ſwayed by any preſent Authority, is
there not ſomething within him, that ſhould prompt him to his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

though at firſt ſight he ſeems never ſo loath and unwilling? Reaſon
it ſelf, whatever becomes of the reſt, ſhould be all for ſecuring the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part. She is often ſeen to beg, and prevail. One common noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the dying remain of diſtorted Nature, one would think ſhould
be enough to win, and ſoften to ſome compliance.</p>
               <p>That a Creature furniſhed with an Immortal mind ſhould act the
part of a Tyrant againſt himſelf to that degree, as to courſe the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Game through all the Mazes of ſo bloody a Scene. Infamous,

Truly a man might have well ſpared the caſe for the ſake of the
Jewel. He might have been tender of the Chryſtal in regard of the
precious Diamond incloſed in it. If I recite to you the Sentiments
of the wiſer Heathens concerning the Soul, 'tis enough to amaze a
man to find how regardleſs ſome are of it. And that the Sons of
Reaſon, who are ſtruck with the Divine Ferula, and do ſparkle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt

judgment to contrive, and leiſure to enjoy. That they who ſhould
flouriſh, and ſpread themſelves into all the fair, and goodly branches
of Love and Amity; under whoſe ſoft ſhadow the Immortal mind
might gladly acquieſce, ſhould be ſo ſuddenly blaſted with the fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

               <p>A Man cannot be his own diſpatcher without breaking the Laws

an evil in the order of nature before the prohibition of it. Some
of the Divine Statutes we find are delivered in a fair Compendium,
without any amplification at all, having an injunction which looks
like the brevity of an Emperor, with no more than, <hi>Thou ſhalt not.</hi>
Others are recommended in a larger expoſition; becauſe, it may be,
they are clothed with ſuch circumſtances as natural light will hardly
diſcover. Now for Self-murder, had all been ſilent about it, had there
been no poſitive Laws to fence mankind againſt the hazards of ſuch a
ſenceleſs undertaking, there would have been enough in the breaſts
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:33653:14"/>
of men to convince them of the unreaſonableneſs of it. 'Tis repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of <hi>Solon,</hi> as wiſe a Law-maker as he was, he Enacted no Penal

was, he thought none would be ſo deſperately inhumane as to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
it. And in this, the Orator commends his prudence; for fear
the very mention of ſuch a villany, as yet unknown, ſhould be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to put men upon the practice of it. <hi>Sapienter feciſſe dicitur, cum

               <p>And we may well hint at the reaſon, why there is no ſuch prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Legiſlator, and all other Subordinate Authorities in the

ſtate whatever can juſtifie ſuch an attempt. There is no manner of
precedent, though of never ſo Divine a ſtamp, that can in any wiſe
abett the Legality of it. And though there be ſome extraordinary
caſes, which however do look of a dangerous complexion, yet there
is nothing left imitable for us, unleſs the Morality, if we can find
any, wrapt up in them; there is nothing in the world can legitimate
that action, which in its own nature is eternally and intrinſecally evil.
For a Sea-Commander to evade the terror of the Victor, and to ſhun
the ſlavery of the vanquiſhed, to ſink himſelf forthwith, and to
hurry his ſhattered veſſel with all the fainting crew into that inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Gulf, is we muſt confeſs a deſperate, but not a generous exploit:
And we may be ſo far from juſtifying, that we have little elſe to do
beſides lamenting their deplorable ſtate.</p>
               <p>Thoſe braver <hi>Romans,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Cato <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ticenſis,</hi> &amp;c. that durſt be

Exemplars of virtue and integrity in other things, cannot be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in this. To break their confinement through an unnatural viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they cannot but be argued both of weakneſs and imprudence
at once. And what theſe little Heroes did in paſſion and regret, muſt
not be thought to be a Standard for any ſucceeding people to act by.
For all that ever departed this way, muſt be cenſured either of a fond
impatience, or an ambition which will hardly be vindicated. And
who will ſo far venture on the miſcarriage as to expoſe himſelf to the
imitation of ſuch wild exorbitancies as theſe, not ſit to be medled
with by one, that will wait the reſults of common Inſtinct, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:33653:15"/>
frame his temper according to the regular products of the Natural
Law; for a man to ſhift himſelf in this manner, is certainly no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of valour. Will you count him a man of bravery and executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that firſt makes the direful experiment on himſelf? Will you not
rather brand him for a Coward, and adjudg his poor undertaking much
like the running from an enemy, when he is ſeen to ſneak out of the

'Tis far from being conſiſtent with the fulneſs, and magnanimity of
the reaſonable compoſition. Man of all Creatures ought to be moſt
watchful, and prudent in what doth more immediately concern his
preſervation; for he is furniſhed as 'twere with a double life, a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
and a Spiritual one; and upon the miſcarriage of the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
the miſery of the other. And indeed by how much the more

he be, if he periſh. The meaſures of his care ought then to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the weightineſs of his adventure. And indeed, it muſt needs
argue ſuch a littleneſs of ſpirit for any one to quit this preſent life,
out of an apprehenſion of ſome threatning difficulties that may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it, that it can ſcarce be imagined ever common Reaſon ſhould
be forced under ſuch an ungrateful circumſtance. 'Tis an argument,
That that man has little or no meaſure of things, when we ſee him
raging and racking himſelf under the preſſures of a broken fortune,
and every moment ready to become his own Aſſaſſine. Too viſible a
manifeſtation here is of his horrid diſtruſting that unknown power,
who can ſoon change the tide, and buoy up his ſinking ſtate, though
languiſhing away to never ſo low an ebb, and with new ſupplies can
recruit his neceſſities, out of the two inexhauſtible Exchequers, Clouds
and Providence.</p>
               <p>'Tis for want of true Valuing what we have, tho never ſo little,

Proud drops that we are, never ſatisfied till we are Oceans. We
talk much of being Poor, but I reckon none are really ſo, except the
wealthieſt of Men robb'd of the the genuine Treaſure of a virtuous
contented Mind, the only thing that denominates a Man rich.
Alas! we are generally quite miſtaken in the notion of Riches; a
greedy inſatiable Miſer is ſo far from being a rich Man, that you
can make no more of him then a poor hungry Slave amidſt all his
Enjoyments. 'Twas cuſtomary with the <hi>Jews</hi> of old in repreſenting
and ridiculing a covetous Wretch, for a Company of them to march
about, each with his Basket in his hand, acting the part of Beggers,
and withal mentioning the Perſon whom they were minded to deride,
(as in the Caſe of <hi>Geſſius Florus, Joſ. Bell. Jud. l. 2.)</hi> whereby they
ſignified to the World, that ſuch a Perſon was as miſerable as the
Beggar that had nothing. And if I add ten times more, I think
I may have have thoſe of my ſide to ſay, I do not err in the Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>But not to run too far into this moſt neceſſary Digreſſion. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Mens circuſtances were ſomething narrow, and their preſent
Fortunes were circumſcribed with a cloſer preſſure then ordinary;
Poverty, they ſay, is like a Girdle, who tho it may for a time pinch
the Body with an uneaſy Tincture, yet 'twill keep the Garments
from falling into looſneſs and diſorder. There is a ſort of Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
that is capable of being heightened, and improved by Calamity,
which by a patient Toleration will in time paſs into an invincible
fortitude. Look into the humble Cell, where you may ſee noble
Poverty and Content ſtand hand in hand, and joyfully ſaluting all
that will enter; where lives one as gay and cheary, as free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confin'd,
as the very Air in which he breathes. Here is one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires
into the ſweetneſs of himſelf, and ſcorns what can threaten his
Content. He can ſmile at yonder Cloud that's ready to launch in
Thunder and Storm; He can deride the ſullen Attacks of a viler
State. Look how unbroken is his Sleep, how ſerene his Breaſt,
how bright his Day, and glorious as the breaking <hi>Eaſt.</hi> But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
               <p>If Diſcontent be the common Incentive, why Men are provoked
to commit that Barbarity on themſelves, which even Nature abhors,
then there can be no Apology for it. For 'tis a Deformity of our
own making; 'tis a Brat of our own helliſh Darkneſs, and ſo cruel
an Off-ſpring that 'twill devour the very Parent that nurs'd it. For
I am apt to think that the greateſt Hell is of our own creating; and
that this dark State cannot ſo well be defind by any thing without,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:33653:16"/>
as by ſomething within us. And 'tis as great a Torment as can be
thought on, to be ſtung by thoſe fiery Snakes that are bred within the
Caverns of a foul Mind. And further, I make no queſtion, thoſe
ſtreams of Brimſtone, ordered for the damned hereafter, are rather
the Exudations of their own corrupt Nature, than any thing elſe;
and they may ſuffer a greater Torture from themſelves, than from
any thing that can be externally offered. Hence 'tis, that many are
ſo loath, <hi>in ſeſe deſcendere: Nemo</hi> the Poet concludes; only for
fear of being poyſoned with thoſe impure Steams that do reak from
the black Gulf of themſelves.</p>
               <p>Out of this fuming fit ariſeth all manner of trembling and deſpair,
and like thoſe clammy Vapours ſpringing from the earthy Globe,
whoſe weight not permitting them to riſe to any conſiderable height,
do ſpread themſelves about the Circumference of that Body, where
they were firſt generated, and do continually peſter it with Thunder
and Tempeſt. Now, 'tis only when we ſtrive to cleanſe and garniſh
thoſe Caves; 'tis only when we do our beſt to aſcend <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and
to riſe as 'twere out of the Dungeon of the Body, that we feel our
ſelves in a clear Air, in a Region every way calm and ſerene. And
then will thoſe black Affections of deſpair and anguiſh vaniſh away,
and thoſe clear and bright ones of Love, Joy and Tranquility, break
forth in their full ſtrength, and ſhine in the Glories of their own
native Luſtre. He that has an ill Conſcience, needs no angry Cherub
with a flaming Lance. He has an armed Giant already that ſtands
raging and ready to devour. And tho we could ſuppoſe never ſo
mild a Seaſon without us, things never ſo ſweet and pacate, yet all
would avail nothing, when there is a burning <hi>Veſuvius</hi> continually
vomiting out Flames and Horror within. A Man that is of a quiet
and even Diſpoſition, and has all things ſo well ſhaped within him,
as not to be ſtartled at the Limnings of darker Fancy; 'tis he certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that lives nobly and happily, and conſtantly enjoys a clear Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the compaſs of his own mind. When the Sea of this World
is moſt rough and tempeſtuous about him, he can ride ſafely at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
within the calm Haven of himſelf; he can look about him, and
with an indifferent glance behold either the Smiles, or the Frowns of
Fortune.</p>
               <p>Now, that this might not be ſuppoſed to be a needleſs ſtep from
the preſent purpoſe, all that I contend for, is, that no Man of a calm,
regular frame, can be driven on ſo abſurd a thing as Self-Murder; an
injury to Life and Nature; a thing as loathſom in the thought,
as 'tis dreadful in the Execution. If he be, I can allow it no better

themſelves. And how they could be juſtified in the attempt, tho they
had no other Philoſophy but that of Nature to direct them, we can't

this kind, and were often diſputing, that 'twas but a poor Specimen
of Valour, if they could not encounter a little trouble; and that
we were placed in this world as Soldiers by their General, each man
at his Poſt, and none to move without order; and that ſelf-vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
was a breach not only to our own perſons, but the Kingdom,

ſudden death much more, becauſe it comes to us in the ſhape of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and ſurprize. But of all kinds of death a ſelf-violent one muſt
needs be as the moſt unſafe to a mans ſelf, ſo the moſt uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to any ſurviving Relation; for as doubts may ariſe of the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of ſuch a ones valediction to this world, ſo there may be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
concern at his being fit for the entertainment of a better.</p>
               <p>A man cannot act againſt himſelf in ſo baſe and felonious a manner
without highly prejudicing his Immortal part, and interrupting his
eternal tranquility. For according to the terms on which we now
all ſtand, impenitence and irremiſſion are ſuch, as the former muſt
needs ſuppoſe the latter. And how a man can be ſaid to prerepent
of a dangerous fact, which he is preſently entring upon, and by
means of which he is precluded from all future hopes, and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
in order to ſuch an effect, muſt be left to a deeper enquiry,
than I am at preſent able to make. Certainly, if there be any thing
of pardon <hi>ante factum,</hi> it muſt be ſuppoſed to be by grant of diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation;
which includes both an allowance of the fact, and alſo an
exemption from puniſhment; which would be a horrid thing for any
man to ſuppoſe in the preſent Caſe. Hence it is that the moſt candid
Caſuiſt can hardly find in it a capacity of being pardoned. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Eccleſiaſtick Cenſure, the party we know is ſuppoſed to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:33653:17"/>
be <hi>ipſo facto</hi> Excommunicate. And therefore it was that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> left
it ſo ſtrictly in caution, that no one ſhould dare to diſpatch himſelf,
though to never ſo good a purpoſe, even the getting free from any
preſent inconvenience, leſt he ſhould be miſtaken in his aim, and
from thinking to make his condition better, render it infinitely and
unſpeakably worſe. <hi>Neminem ſpontaneam mortem ſibi inferre debere ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lut

Further I confeſs, I am not old enough to conceive how ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violence,
as in the preſervation of ſome virtue or other, ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
the title of Martyrdom. The cauſe may be good 'tis true, which
indeed conſtitutes the Martyr, but how good that cauſe muſt be which
juſtifies an ill act, I can't well determine; and ſhould be very cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to celebrate for Martyrdom, what we can make little elſe than
plain murder. The caſe of <hi>Pelagia</hi> is rather to be pitied than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.
Though that tender Creature did it undoubtedly to miſs
thoſe unhandſome Violations to which ſhe ſaw her ſelf expoſed. And
'tis pity, methinks, that the bluſhes of ſo Divine a modeſty ſhould
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:33653:18"/>
wholly diſappear by ſuch a haſty indiſcreet management of her ſelf.
The moſt that St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpake of it, when his Siſter <hi>Marcellina</hi>
conſulted him directly to give in his thoughts about this matter, was,
He believed, that might not be reputed as an offence, which was
made uſe of as a remedy. But it muſt be a deſperate diſtemper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to admit of ſo dangerous an application. And <hi>Baronius</hi> was ſo
perplexed about it, that he e'ne concluded, <hi>Quid ad haec dicamus, non

<hi>nullo modo;</hi> upon no account, whether it be the removing any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
or the preventing any future evil, or the gratifying ſome flaſhy
deſire to be in the next life, can it be lawful for any man to do vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to himſelf. In reference to this laſt it was, that he gave his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion

it my caſe that I had a friend ſo determining, I would beg the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

the Annals of time, and ſuffer it rather to remain a blot, than any
diſcernable note in the Calender of Eternity.</p>
            <p>Oh! That Nature's Garment ſhould ſit uneaſie about any one, as

            <p>Further, what hard thoughts will the world be apt to entertain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

they will rather cenſure it by the uſe that is made of it, to be ſome

ſuch a one never been, or being, had been long ſince baniſhed from
his own eſſence, and commencing ſome other kind, had paſſed into
an innocent Animal, that was never like to have the burthen of an
after-thought to gall and perplex him! That man who is only capable
here of thoſe higher acceſſions of thought and ſtudy, ſhould not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
conſider what a noble thing 'tis to live! Life, we are to be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
is the higheſt perfection of Corporeal Beings, becauſe the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
reſemblance of the Divine. The moſt contemptible Creature in
whom the Springs of Life are in motion, can boaſt of a prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
beyond the Stars; and the minuteſt part of an Organiz'd Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and enliven'd, may challenge the Sun, and bid defiance to its
Inanimate luſter. But alas! 'tis not barely to live, that we plead for:
If ſo, the vileſt of Brute Animals may well rank themſelves with the
higheſt Sons of Reaſon. But when Life it ſelf ſhall be adorned and
glorified with all thoſe Excellencies and Advantages, to render it eaſie
and delightful, that can be named, this is that which raiſeth it beyond
a common breathing. And all men I reckon might live happy, if
they would themſelves; if they would be ſteady in their deſires, and
equal in their apprehenſions of things preſent. They might have
then ſaved wiſe <hi>Democritus</hi> the trouble of exchanging his Paſſion,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33653:19"/>
who though 'twas his conſtant buſineſs to laugh, yet having once
lighted on a man of an indifferent temper like himſelf, could not
forbear dropping a tear, for that the number of ſuch men was ſo
ſmall.</p>
            <p>Indifferency, we confeſs, is a flower that grows not in every
Garden: where we ſhall meet with one that is calm, eaſie and dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable
under every circumſtance, and event of things, we ſhall
be peſtered with a hundred that are nothing but ſtorm and noiſe;
and if any thing croſſes their deſires, they think it their only reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to rage and boil away in the fury of ſome baſe extreme. And
truly I can't think it any other, but for want of ſtudying the Golden
Rule of Equality, that moſt men are as miſerable in the defeat of
their expectations, as before they were eager in the purſuit of their
deſires. Of all men of his Rank, <hi>Seneca</hi> came at length to be moſtly
admired for a man of a patient, even temper, who in every inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
juncture found more pleaſure and contentment in his own
quiet apprehenſion of things, than he did trouble and uneaſineſs in
their diſcompoſure. And <hi>Cleanthes</hi> was as noble in his Sentiment;
as <hi>Seneca</hi> was now grown diſcreet in his behaviour, when he was ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

            <p>Alas! what meanneſs of ſpirit does this argue? a man of a ſowr,

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33653:19"/>
which a great part of mans miſery is owing. Men are often ſeen to
terrifie themſelves with what may be, and to erect Schemes of futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the Shop of their amazed fancy. They would fain be ſpell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out their future ſtate, when 'twould make abundantly more for
their happineſs and tranquility <hi>in diem vivere,</hi> and to entertain their
preſent fortune with all imaginable eaſe and freedom.</p>

to his ſhifts to fly away in horror and ſadneſs, when in the iſſue the
air proves mild and temperate; they poſſeſs themſelves with the
dread of a ſad, diſcontented day approaching, which will even
weep out its eyes. But when 'tis born, it proves a <hi>Democritus,</hi> and
does nothing but laugh at the foolery of their extravagant prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions.</p>
            <p>Another thing which renders us in a great degree miſerable is this:
We are extremely buſie in proſecuting our fond deſires, and are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
deceived by our overmuch confidence in the enjoyment.
Like ſilly Children we think the Sky lies on yonder hill, which we
either loſe in the proſecution, or find vaſtly removed from our eager
proſpect. The temper of moſt men is never to be ſatisfied till they
are got up to the height of enjoyment; and 'tis a great hazard but
they then find themſelves far more uneaſie than they were before,
and would fain, if poſſible, be reſtored to their former point,
and wiſh they had never taſted the enjoyment. They are fit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
to that King in <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who being diſturbed by his enemies
and accuſers in the poſſeſſion of the Throne, came to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and told
him, He had the Subſtance, but now craved the ſhadow of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>And here too, even in this we ſhall meet with great variety of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours;
ſome love to be great and popular; others to be gave and
reſerved. When as an <hi>Alexander</hi> grows big with Empire, and groans
for more worlds to conquer, a <hi>Diocleſian</hi> gladly retires from his
Throne and Auguſtneſs, to a Rural Farm, as from a ſtate of Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Servitude, to that of freedom and repoſe. Some men chuſe
rather to live a private life, wherein is ſecurity, than in the height
of fortune and honour, with perpetual danger and diſquiet. But
now here is the moſt pinching and tremendous conſideration of all,
that after a man has been variouſly exerciſed, and ſhifted from this
ſide to that, he ſhall for want of an Executioner become his own; a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:33653:20"/>
man in this caſe is divided, and at enmity againſt himſelf, and in a

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> both the active and paſſive ſubject
of his own action. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that he curſed the number
Two, becauſe 'twas the firſt that preſumed to depart from Unity.
Now 'tis by Unity that things are preſerved, and Individuals are
principally one; and therefore if Individuals be divided againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and things ceaſe to be true and amically diſpoſed towards
themſelves, there is no other to be expected, deſolation muſt needs
enſue, the world it ſelf can't ſtand. 'Tis ſtrange that any one ſhould
be ſo hideouſly cruel to himſelf, beyond all exceptions of pity and
compaſſion: Indeed, to render the whole circuit of <hi>Autophony</hi> the
more conſpicuo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, I can't think that any man ſhould abſolutely deſire
to be miſerable or wretched in his laſt exiſtence. But the thing is, upon
ſome diſtaſte he affects the diſſolution of his preſent, and perſonal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,
upon intention and hope by ſuch a change to be bettered in his
future condition. And therefore for the preſent he is, as 'twere, at odds
with himſelf; and like two intimate perſons, the nearer is their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
the greater is their diſtance when they fall into diviſion, and
the likelier to continue if there be no Reconciler; his condition is
much the more deſperate, becauſe the difference riſes high, and there
wants a Mediator of Reconciliation betwixt a man and himſelf. But
it muſt be a deſperate attack indeed, when a man ſhall precipitate
himſelf no ſo dangerous a hazard as we are now mentioning; to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
himſelf ſo prepoſterouſly, and in the ſeparation to ſend one
part of himſelf, to inherit no more mercy than we can ſuppoſe to
hover <hi>inter pontem, &amp; fontem;</hi> the other to be expoſed like the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment
of ſome viler Creature, and to be denied the decencies of a
common obſequy. Nay moreover, whoſe very goods are adjudged
execrable hereby, <hi>i. e.</hi> as to men. And therefore do from that very
inſtant become a <hi>Deodand,</hi> as returning to their principal owner.</p>
            <p>Indeed there are ſome caſes (as I am well informed) in which the
Law univerſally allows an orderly Sepulture, ſuch as deep Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or an extraordinary <hi>Delirium.</hi> And we have an account out of
an ancient Author of two Melancholy Brethren that murdered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and for ſo foul an act were condemned to an infamous Burial;
but when upon further examination it appeared that miſery and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
were the Incentives, the Sentence was revoked, and the deceaſed
honoured with a due ſolemnity. This ſeems very tolerable, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
with humane Prudence to mitigate theſe hard Cenſures;
for when men are ſad beyond meaſure, and are haraſſed by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of a long diſtemper, they oft-times ſuffer under a frightful
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:33653:20"/>
wreck of Reaſon; and then like a Ship without a Pilot, they muſt
needs ſplit on the next Rock. But this is ſo rarely proved, and ſo ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
regarded, that moſt men to ſhew the malignity of ſo deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a fact, are for expoſing the Criminal to an Exemplary diſgrace.
And therefore as among the <hi>Romans</hi> they had their <hi>Pertae Sceleratae,</hi>
through which the Bodies of the Dead were dragg'd; ſo now the
manner is to convey them to a ſeparate place, and there ſtake
down the trembling Corps reaking in its own gore and filth,<note place="margin">Athenienſes abſciſſant manum <gap reason="foreign">

that one hand ſhould be left unburied. And 'twas a Statute made
by <hi>Tarquin,</hi> that their whole Bodies ſhould be hung up in the air.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us, 'Twas anciently determined among the <hi>Jews,</hi>
that though they generally held it lawful to bury their Enemies, yet
they reſolved 'twas not fit the body of the Self-murderer ſhould be
Interr'd till the going down of the Sun. And 'twas Cuſtomary with
other Nations, he tells us farther, to cut off their right hands,
judging that as the Soul hereby was made a ſtranger to the Body, ſo
by that fact the hand was as 'twere a ſtranger to both. <hi>Joſeph. de Bell.

            </p>
            <p>The ſhame and ignominy then to which they generally expoſed
ſuch a one, does ſufficiently teſtifie their judgment of ſo notorious a
fact. And indeed conſidering the Obligations the Self-murderer
breaks through, the quality of the fact, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how can we ſuppoſe them
to be leſs rigorous in making their reſentment of it as Exemplary as
may be? Here is an irreparable breach made in humane Society;
here is an unnatural violation of the Law of Self-charity; (when we
can't otherwiſe ſuppoſe but that this is a thing which ought firſt to
begin at our ſelves, and that we are under higher obligations to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
our own lives, than the lives of others; and more obliged not
to deface that Divine Image upon our ſelves, than upon any other of
mankind.) Here is an abuſe of that Right of Nature, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to be a liberty that each man hath to uſe his power, not in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to his deſtruction, but the contrary. For this were really to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe

Rational man will ever pretend to any right. And if once broken,
whether out of error, paſſion, or ſurpriſe, nothing can be pleaded
