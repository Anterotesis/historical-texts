            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Character of a TRIMMER. THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT must be more than an ordinary provocation that can tempt a Man to writ in an Age, over-run with Scriblers, as <hi>Aegypt</hi> was with Flies and Locusts; that worse Vermine of small Authors hath given the World such a surfeit, that instead of desiring to Writ, a Man would be inclined to wish for his own ease, that he could not Read.</p>
            <p>But there are some things which do raise Our passions, that Our Reason can make no Resistance; and when mad. Men in two Extremes shall agree to make common Sense Treason, and joyn to fix an ill Character upon the only Men in a Nation, who deserved a good One, I am no longer Master of my better Resolutions to let the World alone, and break loose from any more Reasonable Thoughts, to expose those false Coins, who would make their Copper words pass upon us for good payment.</p>
            <p>Amongst all the Engines of Dissention, there hath been none more powerful in all times, than the fixing names upon one another of contumely and reproach; and the Reason is plain, in respect of the people, who tho generally they are incapable of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Sologism, or forming an Argument, yet they can pronounce a word that serveth their turn, to throw it with their dull Malice, at the head of those they do not like. Such ever begin in jest, and end in blood; And the word which maketh the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny merry, groweth in time to a Military Signal, to cut one anothers throats. These mistakes are to be lamented, the not easily to be cured, being suitable enough to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature of Mankind. But it's hard, that Men will not only invent ill names, but they will wrest and misinterpret good Ones: so afraid some are even of a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling sound, that they raise another noise to keep it from being heard, lest it should set up and encourage a dangerous sort of Men, who prefer peace and Agreement before violence and confusion.</p>
            <p>Were it not for this, why after we have play'd the fool with throwing <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory</hi> at one another, as Boys do Snow Balls, do we grow angry at a new name, which by its true signification might do as much to put us into our Wits, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have done to put us out of them?</p>
            <p>This innocent word <hi>Trimmer</hi> signifieth no more then this, that if men are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a Boat, one part of the Company would weigh it down of one side, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would make it lean as much to the contrary: It happeneth there is a third opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who conceive it would do as well if the Boat went even without endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Passengers. Now it is hard to imagine by what figure in Language, or by what rule in Sense, this cometh to be a Fault; and it is much more a wonder that it should be thought a Heresie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:108761:3"/>But so it happeneth that the poor <hi>Trimmer</hi> hath now all the Ponder spent upon him alone, whilst the <hi>Whig</hi> is forgotten or at least a neglected Enemie; There is no danger now to the State (if some men be believed) but from the beast called a <hi>Trimmer</hi>; take heed of him, he is the Instrument that must destroy Church and State. A strange kind of Monster whose deformity is so exposed, that were it a true Picture that is made of him, it would be enough to fright Children and make Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men miscarry at the sight of it.</p>
            <p>But it may be worth examining, whether he is such a beast as he is painted; I am not of that opinion, and am so far from thinking him an Infidel either in Church or State, that I am neither affraid to expose the Articles of his Faith in Relation to Government, nor to lay that I preferr them before any other Political Creed, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Angry Divines, or our refin'd States-men would impose upon us.</p>
            <p>I have therefore in the following discourse endeavoured to explain the <hi>Trimmers</hi> Principles and Opinions, and then leave it to all discerning and impartial, Judges, whether he can with Justice be so arraign'd and whether those who deliberatly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert a good name, do not very justly deserve the worst that can be put upon them.</p>

            <head>THE TRIMMERS Opinion, about Laws and Government in General, With some Reflections, Relating to our Own.</head>
            <p>OUR <hi>Trimmer</hi> hath a great Veneration for Laws in general, as he hath more particularly for our own: He looketh upon them as the chains that tye up our unruly passions, which else like wild Beasts, would reduce the World into its first state of <hi>Barbarism</hi> and <hi>Hostility</hi>; All the good things we enjoy we owe to them; And all the ill things we avoid is by their protection.</p>
            <p>GOD Himself thought it not enough to be a Creator, without being a Law-giver, and His goodness had been defective towards Mankind in making them, If he had not prescribed rules to make them happy too. All Laws flow from that of nature, and where that is not the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they may be legally imposed, but they will be lamely obeyed. By this nature is not meant that which Fools and Libertines would mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quot to justifie their excesses it is innocent and uncorrupted nature, That which disposeth Men to choice Vertue without its being prescribed, and which is so far from inspiring ill thoughts into us, that we take pains to surpress the good ones it infuseth.</p>
            <p>The Civilized World hath ever payed a willing Subjection to Laws, even Conquerors have done homage to them, as the Romans took Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of good Laws, even from those they have subdued, and at the same time they Triumphed over an enslaved people, the Laws of that very place did not only remain safe, but became Victorious, their new Masters instead of suppressing them payed them more respect than they who first made them: And by this wise Method they arrived to such an admirable constitution of Laws, that to this day they do reign by them: The excellency of them triumpheth still, and the World now payeth an acknowledgement of their obedience to that mighty Empire, tho so many Ages after is is dissolved. And by a later instance, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> who in practice use the Laws pretty familiarly, yet they think their Picture is drawn with most advantage upon their Seals, when they are placed in their seats of Justice; and tho the <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> is not of so much use to the people there as they might Wish, yet it sheweth, that no Prince is so great as not to think fit for his own credit to give at least an outward, when he refuseth a real worship to the Laws:</p>
            <p>They are to Mankind that which the Sun is to the Plants, as it Cherisheth and preserveth them; where they have their Force and are not clouded or suppressed, every thing smileth and Flourisheth; but where they are Darkned and not suffered to Shine out, it maketh every
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108761:4"/>
thing wither and decay: They secure Men not only against one another, but against themselves too.</p>
            <p>They are a Sanctuary to which the Crown hath occasion to resort as often as the people, so that it hath an Interest as well as a Duty to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them.</p>
            <p>There would be no end of making a <hi>Panegyrick</hi> of Laws; let it be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to add, that without the Laws the World would become a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Men little less than beasts: But withall this the best things may come to be the worst, if they are not in good hands; And if it be true that the Wise Men generally make the Laws, it is as true that the strongest too often interpret them: And as Rivers belong as much to the channel where they run, as to the Spring from whence they first arise; so the Laws as much depend upon the pipes thorow which they are to pass, as upon the Fountain from whence they flow.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> would have them appear in their full Lustre, and would be grieved to see the day when instead of their speaking with Authority from the Seat of Justice, they should speak out of a Grate with a lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice, like prisoners that desire to be rescued.</p>
            <p>He wisheth that the Bench may ever have a Natural as well as a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Superiority to the Barr. He thinketh Mens Abilities very much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed, when the reason of those who plead is visibly too strong for those who are to Judge and give Sentence.</p>
            <p>When these from the Barr seem to dictat to their Superiors upon the Bench, their furrs will look scurvily about them, and the Respect of the World will leave the bare Character of a Judge to follow the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial knowledge of a Lawyer, who may be greater in himself than others can ever be with all their Trappings.</p>
            <p>An uncontested Superiority in any calling will have the better of any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance that Authority can put upon it, and therefore if ever such an unnatural method should be introduced, it is then that <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi> might be said to stand upon its head; and tho Justice it self can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be so, yet the Administration of it would be rendred Ridiculous.</p>
            <p>A judge hath such a power lodged in him that the King will never be thought to have chosen well, where the voice of mankind hath not before recommended the man to his Election; when men are made judges of what they doe not understand, the World censureth such a choice not out of ill will to the men but fear for themselves.</p>
            <p>If the King had th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> sole power of choising Physicians, men would tremble to see bunglers preferred, yet the necessity of taking Physick from a Doctor is generally not so great as that of receiving Justice from a Judge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:108761:4"/>The inferences would be very severe in such cases, for either it will be thought that such Men bought what they know not how to deserve; or which is as bad, that obedience shall be looked upon as a better qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification in a Judge then Skill or integrity.</p>
            <p>When such Sacred things as the Laws are not only touched, but guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by prophane hands, Men will fear that out of the tree of the Law from whence we expect shade or shelter, such work men will make Cudgels to beat us with, or rather that they will turn the Cannon upon our Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that were intrusted with them for their Defence.</p>
            <p>To see the Laws Mangled, Disguised, made speake quite another Language then their own, to see them thrown from the Dignity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting Mankind to the disgraceful Office of destroying them, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding their Innocence in themselves, to be made the worst Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that the most refined Villany can make use of, will raise Mens anger above their Power to lay it down again, and tempt them to follow the ill Example given them of Judging without Hearing, when so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by their desire of revenge.</p>
            <p>Our Trimmer therefore as he thinketh the Laws are Jewels, so he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth they are no where better set than in the Constitution of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Government, if rightly understood and carefully preserved, It would be too great Partiality to say it is perfect or lyable to no Objection, such things are not of this World, but if it hath more Excellency and fewer faults then any other we know, it is enough to recommend it to our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem.</p>
            <p>The Dispute which is the greater Beautie, a Monarchy, or a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth hath lasted long between their contending Lovers; and they have behaved themselves so like Lovers who in good manners must be out of their Wits; used such Figures to exalt their own Idol, on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side &amp; such angry aggravations to reproach one another in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, that moderate Men have in all times smilled upon this Eagerness, and thought it differed verie little from a down right Frenzie: Wee in <hi>England</hi> by a happy use of this Controversie conclude them both in the wrong, and reject them from being our Pattern, tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing the words in the outmost extent, which is, "Monarchie is a thing which leaveth men "no Libertie, and a Common wealth such an one as alloweth them no quiet. We think that a wise mean betwixt those Barbarous Extremes, is that which self preservation ought to dictate to our wishes, and we may say we have attained to this mean in a greater Measure, then any Nation now in being, and perhaps then any we read of, tho never so much Celebrated for the Wisdom or the Felicitie of their Constitution. We take from one, the too great Power of doing hurt, and yet leave enough
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108761:5"/>
to Govern and Protect us. We take from the other the confusion of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the Animosities, and the Licence, and yet reserve a due care of such a Liberty as may consist with Mens Allegiance. But being hard, if not Impossible to be exactly even, our Government hath much the stronger Byass towards Monarchie, which by the more General content and Practice of Mankind seemeth to have the Advantage in the dispute against the Common-wealth. The rules of a Common-wealth are too hard for the bulk of Mankind to come up to, that Form of Government require<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Monarchie is liked by the People for the Bells and the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, the outward Pompe and the Guilding, and there must be Milk for Babes, the greater part of Mankind are, and ever will be included in that list; and it is approved by wiser and more thinking Men as the best when compar'd with others, and all Circumstances and Objections Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially considered, then it hath so great an advantage above all other forms when the Administration of that Power falleth into a good hand, that all other Governments look out of Countenance when they are set in competition with it. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> might have saved himself the trouble of making Laws, if either he had been immortal, or that he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> could have secured to Posterity a Succeeding race of Princes like himself; His own example was a better Law; then he could with all his skill tell how to make: Such a Prince is a living Law that dictateth to his Subjects, whose thoughts in that case never rise above their obedience; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence they have in the knowledge and vertue of the Master, prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scruples and Apprehensions to which Men are Naturally inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Relation to those that govern them. Such a Magistrate is the Life and Soul of Justice, whereas the Law is but the Body and a dead one too, without his influence to give it Warmth and Vigour; and by the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistable power of his Vertue doth so reconcile Dominion and Allegiance, that all disputes between them are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and subdued. And indeed no <hi>Monarchy</hi> can be perfect and Absolute without exception, but where the Prince is Superior by his Vertue, as well as by his Character and his Power. So that to serve out Presidents of unlimited Power is a plain Diminution to a Prince that Nature hath made Great, and who had better make himself a Glorious Example to Posterity, than borrow an Authority from dark Records raised out of the Grave, which beside their own usage have always in them matters of Controversie and Debate.

And it may be affirmed, that the instances are very rare of Princes having the worst in the Dispute with their people, if they were Eminent either for Justice in time of Peace, or Conduct in time of Warr: Such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage the Crowngiveth to those who adorn and confirm it by their own personal Vertues. But since for the greater honour of good and wise Princes, and the better to set off their Character by the comparison, Heaven hath decreed that there must be a mixture, and that such as are perve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se, and insufficient, or perhaps both, are at least to have their equal turns in the Government of the World; And besides that the Will of Man is so various and unbounded a thing, and so fatal too when joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with power misapplyed, its no wonder if those who are to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are unwilling to have so dangerous as well as so uncertain a standard of their obedience: There must be therefore Rules and Laws, for want of which, or at least the Observation of them, it was as Capital for a Man to say, "<hi>Nero</hi> did not play well upon the Lute, as to commit Treason, or Blaspheme the Gods, and even <hi>Vespasian</hi> himself had like to have lost his Life for sleeping, whilst he should have attended and admired that Emperours impertinencie upon the Stage.</p>
            <p>There is a wantonness in too great power that men are generally too apt to be corrupted with, and for that reason a wife Prince to prevent the temptations arising from common frailty, would choose to Govern by Rules for his own sake, as well as for his Peoples; since it only secureth him from Errors, and doth not lessen the real Authority that a good Magistrate would care to be possessed of. For if the will of a Prince is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrary to reason it self, or to the Universal Opinion of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the Law by a kind restraint rescueth him from a Disease that would undoe him. If his will on the other side is reasonable and well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, that will immediately become a Law, and he is Arbitrary by an easie and natural consequence, without taking pains or overturning the World for it. If Princes consider Laws as things imposed on them, they have the appearance of Fetters of Iron, but to such as would make them their choice as well as their practice, they are Chains of Gold, and in that respect an Ornament, as in others they are a Defence to them: And by a Comparison not improper for Gods Vicegerents upon Earth, As our Maker never commandeth our obedience to anything, that as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Creatures we ought not to make our own Election, so a good and a wise Governour, tho all Laws were abolished, would by the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Direction of his own reason, do without constraint the very same things, that they would have enjoyned.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> thinketh that a King and a Kingdom are to be one Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108761:6"/>
not to be separated in their Political Capacity, and when either of them undertake to act a part, it is like the crawling of Worms after they are cut in pieces, which cannot be a lasting Motion, the whole Creature not stirring at a time. If the Body hath the dead Palsie, the Head cannot make it move, and GOD hath not Delegated such a heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power to Princes, as that they can in a moment say to a Languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people oppressed into despair, <hi>Take up your Bed and Walk.</hi> The Figure of a King, is so comprehensive and so exalted a thing, that it is a kind of degrading him to lodge that power separately in his own natural per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which can never be truely nor safely great, but where they are so united to him, as to be <hi>Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone</hi>: For when he is reduced to the single definition of a Man, he shrinketh into into so low a Character, that it is a temptation upon Mens Allegiance, and an im, paring of that Veneration which is necessary to preserve their duty to him: Whereas a Prince that is so joined to his People, that they seem to be his Limbs rather than his Subjects, clothed with Mercy and Justice rightly applyed in their several places, His Throne supported by Love, as by Power, and the warm wishes of his devouted Subjects like a never failling Incense, still ascending towards him, looketh so like the best Image we can frame to our selves of <hi>God Almighty,</hi> that men would have much adoe not to fall down and worship him, and would be much more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to the sin of <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> then to that of disobedience. Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is of opinion, that there must be so much Dignity inseparablie annexed to the <hi>Regal Function.</hi> As may be sufficient to secure it from insolence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: And there must be condescentions too from the <hi>Throne like kind showers from Heaven.</hi> That the <hi>Prince</hi> may look the more like <hi>GOD Almighties Deputy upon Earth</hi>; for power without love hath a terrifying Aspect. And the worship that is payed to it, is like that which the <hi>Indians</hi> give out of Fear to wild Beasts and Devils. He that feareth GOD only, because there is a Hell, must with there were no <hi>God:</hi> And he who feareth a King only because he can punish, must wish there were no King. So that without a <hi>principle of Love</hi> there can be no <hi>true Allegiance</hi>; And there must remain perpetual Seeds of Resistance against a Power that is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such an unnatural Foundation, as that of Fear and Terror. All force is a kind of foul play, and who ever owneth it himself, doth by impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation allow it to those he playeth with. So that there will be ever mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prepared in the minds of the People when they are so provok'd, and the Prince to secure himself, must live in the midst of his own Subjects, as if he were in a Conquered Countrey, raise Armies, as if he were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to make or resist an Invasion, &amp; all this while sleep as unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108761:6"/>
from the fear of the Remedies, as he did before from that of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease; it being hard for him to forget that more Princes have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed by their Guards, than by their people; and that even the time when the Rule was <hi>Quod Principi placuit Lex esto,</hi> the Armies and <hi>Pretorian</hi> Bands which were the Instruments of that unruly power, were frequently the Means made use of to destroy those who had it. There will ever be this difference between <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Vicegerents,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is always above the Instruments he useth, and out of that danger of receiving hart from them; but Princes can never lodge power in any hands, which may not at some time turn it back upon them.</p>
            <p>For tho it is possible for a King to have power enough to satisfie his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, yet no Kingdom hath money enough to satisfie the Avarice of the under-workmen, who learn from that Prince who will exact more than belongeth to him, to expect from him as much more than they deserve, and growing angry upon the first disappointment, they are like Devils which grow terrible to the Conjurers themselves who brought them up, but cannot send them down again. And besides that there can be no lasting Radical security, but where the Governed are satisfied with the Governours: It must be a Dominion very unpleasant to a Prince of an elevated mind, to impose an abject and a forced Servilty instead of receiving the willing Sacrifice of Duty and Obedience. The bravest Princes in all times, who were incapable of any other kind of Fear, have feared to grieve there own People; such a fear is a Glory, and in this sense it is an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>amy not to be a Coward: so that the mistaken <hi>Hero's</hi> who are void of this generous kind of Fear, need no other Aggravation to compleat their ill Character.</p>
            <p>When a <hi>Despotick</hi> Prince hath bruised all his Subjects into a Slavish O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, all the force he can use, cannot subdue his own Fears; enemies of his own Creation, to which he can never be reconciled, it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to do Injustice, and not fear a Revenge; There is no cure for this Fear but the not deserving to be hurt, and therefore a Prince which doth not allow his thoughts to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to secure himself in all events, yet he is uncapable of Entertaining vain and remote suspitions of those of whom he resolves never to deserve ill. It is verie hard for a Prince to fear a Rebellion, who never doth nor intendeth any thing to provoke it, therefore too great a diligence in the Governours to raise and improve Fears, and dangers from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is no very good Symptome, and naturally begets an Infere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

they have thoughts of putting their Subjects Allegiance to a Tryal: And therefore not without some Reason, Fear before hand, that the irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities they intend, raise Men to a Resiliance.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> thinketh it no advantage to a Government to endeavour the suppressing all kind of Right, which may remain in the body of the people, or to imploy small Authors in it, whose officiousness or want of money may encourage them to write, tho it is not very easie to have abilities equal to such a Subject. They forget that in their too high strain'd Arguments for the Rights of Princes, they very often plead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> which will alwayes give a byass to these Reasons, which seem to be of her side. 'Tis the people that readeth these Books, and it is the people that must judge of them, and therefore no <hi>maxime</hi> should be laid down for the right of Government, to which there can be any reasonable Objection; for the World hath an interest, and for that reason is more than ordinary decerning to find out the weak sides of such Arguments, as are intended to do them hurt: And it is a Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution to a Government, to promote or countenance such well affected Mistakes, which are turned upon it with Disadvantage, when ever they they are Detected and Exposed: And naturally the too earnest endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to take from Men the Right they have, tempt them, by the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to claim that which they have not. And in power as in most other things, the way for Princes to keep it, is not to grasp more than their Arms can well hold. The nice and unnecessary Inquiry into these things, or the Licensing some Books, and suppressing others, without sufficient Reason to justifie the doing, is so far from being an Advantage to a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, that it exposeth it to be the censure of being partial, and to the suspition of having some hidden Designs, to be carried on by these unusual Methods. When all is said, there is a Natural Reason of State, an undefinable thing, grounded upon the common good of Mankind, which is <hi>immortal,</hi> and in all Changes and Revolutions still preserveth its Original Right of saving a Nation, when the Letter of the Law perhaps would destroy it, and by whatsoever means it moveth, carrieth a power with it, that admitteth no Opposition, being supported by Nature, which inspireth an immediate con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> cannot conceive that the power of any Prince can be last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but where it is built upon the Foundation of his own unborrowed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108761:7"/>
vertue: He must not only be the first mover, and the Fountain from whence all the Great Acts of State orginally flow; but he must be thought so by his People, that they may preserve their Veneration to him: He must be jealous of his Power, and not impart so much of it to any about him, as that he may suffer an Eclipse by it.</p>
            <p>He cannot take too much care to keep himself up, for when a Prince is thought to be led by those, with whom he should advise, and that the commands he giveth are transmitted thorow him, and are not of his own growth, the World will look upon him, as a Bird adorn'd with feathers that are not his own, or consider him rather as an engine than a living creature. Besides it would be a contradiction for a Prince, to fear a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and at the same time to creat one himself, by delegat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a Power to any number of Men near him, as is inconsistent with the true figure of a Monarch; It is the worst kind of Co-ordination the Crown can submit to: For it is the exercise of power that draweth the respect along with it, and when that is parted with, the bare Character of a King is not sufficient to keep it up. But tho it is a Diminution to a Prince to parcel out his power so liberally amongst his Favourites, it is yet worse to divide with any other man, to bring himself in competion with a single Rival, a partner in Government, is so unnatural a thing, that it is a squint ey'd Allegiance which must be payed to such a double bottomed Monarchy. The two <hi>Czaars</hi> are an example that the more Civilized part of the World will not be proud to follow, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever gloss may be put upon this method, by those to whom it may be of some use, the Prince will do well to remember and reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the story of certain men, who had set up a Statue in Honour of the Sun, yet in a very little time they turned their back to the Sun, and their Faces to the Statue.</p>
            <p>These mystical Unions are better placed in the other World than they are in this, and we shall have much adoe, when in a <hi>Monarchy Gods Vicegerency</hi> is delegated to more Heads, than that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed.</p>
            <p>Princes may lend some of their Light to make another shine, but they must still prefer the superiority of being the brighter <hi>planet,</hi> and when it hapneth that the Reversion is in Mens eyes, there is more care necessary to keep up the <hi>Dignity of possession,</hi> that Men may not forget who is King, either out of their Hopes or their Fears who shall be.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Sun</hi> should part with all its Light to any of the <hi>Stars,</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> would not know where to find their <hi>God,</hi> after he had so deposed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and would make the Light where ever it went, the <hi>object of their worship</hi>

            <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> owneth a <hi>passion for Liberty,</hi> yet so restrained, that it doth not in the least impair or taint his <hi>Allegiance</hi>: He thinketh it is hard for a Soul that doth not love Liberty, ever to raise it self to another World; He taketh it to be the Foundation of all Vertue, and the only Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that giveth a relish to Life: And tho the laziness of a <hi>slavish subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> hath its charms for the more gross and Earthly part of Mankind, Yet to Men made of a better sort of Clay, all that the World can give without <hi>Liberty</hi> hath no taste; It is true nothing is sold so cheap by <hi>unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men,</hi> but that doth no more lessen the real value of it, then a Country Fellows ignorance doth that of a Diamond in selling it for a pot of Ale.</p>
            <p>Liberty is the <hi>Mistres of Mankind,</hi> she hath powerful charms which do so dazle us, that we find beauties in her which perhaps are not there, as we do in other <hi>Mistresses</hi>: Yet if she was not a Beauty, the World would not run mad for her. Therefore since the reasonable desire of it ought not to be restrained, and even the unreasonable desire of it cannot be suppressed; those who will take it away from a people posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of it, are likely either to fail in their attaining, or to be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet in keeping of it. Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> admireth our blessed Constitution in which Dominion and Liberty are so happily reconciled; It giveth to the Prince the Glorious Power of commanding Free-men, and to the Subject the satisfaction of seing that Power so lodged, as that their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are secure: It doth not allow the Crown such <hi>a ruining power</hi> as that no grass can grow wherever it tradeth, but a <hi>cherishing &amp; protecting</hi> Power, such an one as hath a Grim Aspect only to the ofsending Subjects, but it is the joy and pride of the good ones, their own Interest being so bound up in it, as to engage them to Defend and Support it: As the King is in some in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ter of obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to them; He thinketh that tho they may at some times be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to Authority, yet they add the greatest strength to it under a wise Administration: He believeth no Government is perfect, except a kind of Omnipotence reside in it, To be exerced upon great occasions: Now this cannot be attained by force upon the People, let it be never so great; there must be their consent too, or else a nation moveth only (by being driven) a sluggish and constrained motion, void of that life and vigor, which is necessary to produce great things. Whereas the virtual consent of the whole being included in their Representatives, and the King giving the Sanction to the united Sense of the People, every Act done by such an Authority seemeth to be an Act of their choise, as well as a part of their duty; and they do with an eagerness of which men are uncapable whilst under a force, execute whatever is so enjoyned as their own will better explained by Parliament, rather then from the terror of incurring the penaltie of the Law for omitting it. And by the means of this Political Omnipotence, what ever Sap or Juice there is in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be to the last drop produced, whilst it riseth naturally from
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108761:9"/>
the Root? Whereas all power exerced without consent is like wounds and Gashes, and Topping a Tree at unseasonable Times, for the present occasion which in a very little time must needs destroy it. Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> believeth that by the Advantage of Our <hi>Situation,</hi> there can hardly any such sudden discase come upon us, but that the King may have time enough left to consult with his <hi>Physicians in Parliament.</hi> Pretences in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may be made, but a real necessity so pressing, that no delay is to admitted, is hardly to be imagined; and it will neither be able to give an instance of any such thing for the time past, or reasonable to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume it will ever happen for the time to come. But if that strange thing should happen to fall out, our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is not so strait lac'd, as to let a Nation die or be stiffled, rather then it should be helped by others then the proper Officers; the cases themselves would bring the Remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them, and he is not afraid to allow, that in order to its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, there is a hidden power in Government which should be lost if it was defined; A certain mystery by vertue of which a Nation may be at some Critical time secured from Ruine: But then it must be keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Mystery. It is rendered useless when touched by unskilful hands; and no Government ever had or deserved to have that power, which was so warrie as to Anticipat their claim to it. Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> cannot help thinking it had been better, if the Triennial Act had been observed; First, Because it is the Law, and he would not have the Crown, by such an example, teach the Nation to break it: All Irregularity is catching, it hath contagion in it, especially in an Age so much more inclined to follow ill Paterns, then good ones: He would have had a Parliament, because it is an Essential part of the Constitution, even without the Law, it being the only provision in extraordinary cases, in which there would otherways be no Remedy: And there can be no greater Solicism in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, than a failing of Justice: He would have had one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nothing else can unite and heal us, all other means are meer shifts and projects, houses of Cards blown down with the least breath, and that cannot resist the difficulties which are ever to be presumed in things of this kind: And he would have had one, because it might have done the King good, and could not possibly have done him hurt without his own consent, which in that case is not to be supposed.</p>
            <p>Therefore, for him to fear it, is so strange and so little to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, that the reasons can never be presumed to grow in our soil, or to thrive in it, when transplanted from any other Country: And no doubt there are such irresistable Arguments for the calling a Parliament,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108761:10"/>
that tho it might be denyed to the unmannerly threatnings of men, that are Mutinous and disaffected, it would be granted to the soft and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequious murmours of his Majesties best Subjects: And there would be such a <hi>Rhetorick</hi> in their silent grief, that it will at last prevail against the Artifices of those, who either out of guilt or Interest, afraid to throw themselves upon their Country, knowing how scurvily they have us'd it. That day of Judgment will come, tho we know neither the day nor the hour, and Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> would live so, as to be prepared for it, with full assurance in the meantime, that the Lamenting voice of a Nation cannot long be resisted, and that a Prince, who would so forgive his People when they had been in the wrong, cannot fail to hear them when they are in the right.</p>

            <head>THE TRIMMERS <hi>Opinion Concerning RELIGION, to the Producing Quiet amongst our Selves.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>RELIGION hath such a Superiority above all others things, and that indispensable influence upon all mankind, that it is as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to our living happily in this World: as it is to our being saved in the next: Without it man is an abandoned Creature, one of the worst beasts nature hath produced, and fit only for the Society of Wolves and Bears. Therefore in all Ages it hath been the <hi>foundation</hi> of Government; and tho <hi>False Gods</hi> have been imposed upon the Credulity of the World; yet they were God's still in their opinion: And the aw &amp; deference Men had to them, and their Oracles kept them within bounds towards one another, which the Laws alone <hi>with all their Authority</hi> could never have <hi>affected without the help of Religion,</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> would not be able to subdue the perversness of Mens wills, which are wild Beasts that require a double chain to keep them down.
<q>
                  <hi>For this Reason it is said, that it is not a sufficient ground to make War on a neighbouring State, because they are of an other Religion: let it be never so differing; yet if they worship and acknowlege no Deity at all, they may be invaded as publick Enemies of Mankind, because they reject the only thing that can bind men to live well with an other.</hi>
               </q> The consideration of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108761:10"/>
is so tuisted with the Government, that it is never to be separat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and tho the Foundations of it are to be unchangable and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, yet the forms and Circumstances of Discipline, are to be suited to the several Climates and Constitutions, so as they may keep men in a willing acquiescence to them without discomposing the World by Nice Disputes, which can never be of equal Moment with the publick Peace.</p>
            <p>Our Religion here in <hi>England,</hi> seemeth to be distinguished by a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Effect of <hi>God Almighties</hi> goodness, in permitting it to be introduced or more properly restored, by a more Regular method, Then the circumstances of most other Reformed Churches, would allow them to do in Relation to the Government, and the Dignity with which it hath supported it self; and the great men our Church hath produced, ought to recommend it to the esteem of all Protestants; At least our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is very partial to it for these Reasons and many more, and desirous that it may preserve its due Jurisdiction and Authority, so far he is from wishing it opprest, by the malicious or unreasonable Cavils of those who take pains to raise Objections to it. The Question then will be how, and by what methods this Church shall best support it self, the present Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances considered in relation to Dissenters of all Sorts? I will first lay it for a ground, that as there can be no true Religion without Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, so there can be no humane prudence without bearing and Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scention. This principal doth not extend to oblige the Church alwayes to yield to those, who are disposted to contest with it, the expediencie of doing it, is to be considered and determined according to the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; And this leadeth me to lay open the thoughts of our <hi>Trimmer,</hi> in reference first to the Protestant and then to the Popish Recusants. What heat lately happned amongst us, makes an Apology necessary for saying any thing that looketh like favour towards any sort of men, who have brought themselves under such a disadvantage. The late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy hath such broad Symptoms of the disaffection of the whole party, that upon the first Reflection whilst our Thoughts are warm, it would almost perswade us to put them out of the Protection of our good nature, and to think that the Christian indulgence, which our compassion for other Mens sufferings cannot easily deny, seemeth against, and even becometh a Crime when it is so misapplyed. Yet for all this, upon second and colder thoughts, moderate men will not be so ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve a whole party in the guilt of a few, or to admite inferences and presumptions, to be evidences in a case, where the Sentence must be so heavy, as it ought to be against all those, who have a fixed Resolution
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108761:11"/>
against the Government established. Besides men who act by a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple grounded upon a Moral Vertue can never let it be intirely extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by the most repeated Provocations. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a right thing agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to nature and good sense taketh root in the heart of a Man, that is impartial and unbyassed, no outward Circumstances can ever destroy it; 'Tis true the degree of Mans zeal for the Prosecution of it may be differing, the faults of other Men, the consideration of the Publick, and the reasonable Prudence by which wise Men will ever be directed, may give great Allays, they may lessen, and perhaps for a time suppress the exercise of that, which in a general Proposition may be reasonable but what ever is so, will inevitable grow and spring up again, having a Foundation in nature which is not to be destroyed. Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeavours to separate the detestation he hath of those who had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a hand or a thought in the late Plot, from the principle of Pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, as well as Christian Charity towards Mankind; And for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, would fain use the means of Reconciling such of the <hi>Dissenters</hi> as are not incurable, and of even off bearing to a degree those that are, as far as may consist with the publick interest and security. He is far from justifying an affected separation from the Communion of the Church, and even in those who mean well and are misled, he looketh upon it as a disease that hath sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves reasonable, they are in that respect to be observed, even without being enjoyned, if by the change of times and circumstances they should become less reasonable than when they were first made, even then the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He hath too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the <hi>constitution</hi> of our <hi>Government,</hi> to wish any more <hi>Prerogative Declarations</hi> in favours of Scrupulous men, or to Dispense with <hi>Penal Laws</hi> in such a manner, or to such an end. That suspecting men might with some reason apprehend, that so hated a thing as a Persecution could never make way for it self with any hope of Success, otherwayes then
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:108761:11"/>
by preparing the deluded World with a false prospect of Liberty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence. The inward Springs and Wheels by which that Engine mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are not so fully laid open and exposed, that it is not supposable such a baffled Experiment should ever b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tryed again. The effect it had at that time, and the spirit it raised will not easily be forgotten; and it may be presumed that the remembrance of it may secure us from any more attempts of that kind for the future; we must no more break a Law to give a man ease, then we are to Robb a house, with a devout intention of giving the plunder to the Poor: In this case our compassion would be ill directed, as our Charity in the other; in short, the Veneration due to the Laws is never to be thrown off, let the pretensions be never so specious. Yet for all this, he cannot bring himself to think that an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary diligence to exact the outmost penalties of the Law, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>upon a poor offending Neighbour, is of it self such an alsufficient Vertue, that without something else to recommend men, it should Entittle them to all kind of Preserments and Rewards. He would not detract from the merits of those who execute the Laws, yet he cannot think that such a piece of service as this, can entirely change the Man, or either make him a better Divine, or a more knowing Magistrate then he was before, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if it be done with a partial and unequal hand, in reference to great and more dangerous Offenders. Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> would have these <hi>mistaken Men</hi> ready to throw themselves in the Arms of the Church, and he would have these Arms as ready to receive them: He would have no Supercilious looks to fright these stray'd Sheep from coming into the Fold again, no ill natured Maxims of Eternal Suspition, or a belief that these who have been in the wrong can never be in the right again; But a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible preparation of the mind to receive with joy, all the Proselites that shall come to us, and a much greater Earnestness to reclaim, then punish them. It is to be confessed, that when there is a great deal to forgive, it is task hard enough for a Church to provoked: But that must not cut off all hopes of being reconciled.

Authority, whose Stomach riseth against a hard Imposition; Nay be in some a Lust in suffering from a wrong point of Honour, which yet doth not want the Applause of the great part of Mankind, who have not learned to distinguish: Constancie will be thought a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue even when it is a mistake, and the ill judging World will be apt to think the Opinion most in the Right, which produceth the greater Numbers of those who are willing to suffer for it; all this is prevented and falls to the ground by using well-timed Indulgences. And the stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Adversary who valueth himself upon his Resistance whilst he is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, yieldeth unsensibly to kinder methods when they are applyed to him; And the same man melteth naturally into conformity, who perhaps would never have been beaten into it.</p>

            <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> would have the Clergy supported in their Lawful Rights, and in all the Power and Dignity that belongeth to them; and yet he thinketh that possibly there may be in some of them, a too great ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerness to extend the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, which tho' it may be well intended, yet the straining it too high, hath an appearance of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, that raiseth mens Objections to it, and is so very unlike the Apostolick Zeal, which was quite otherwayes Applied, that the World draweth inferences from it, which do the Church no service: He is troubled to see Men of all sides sick of a <hi>Calenture</hi> of a Mistaken Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>emeth to him, that the devout Fire of Mutual Charity with which the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> were inflamed, is long since extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished and instead of it, a devouring a fire of Anger and Persecution breaking out in the World. We wrangle with one another for Religion, till the Blood cometh; whilst the Commandments have no more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with us, then if they were so many Absolute Laws, or Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations out of date. He thinketh that a Nation will hardly be mended by Principles of Religion, where Morality is made an Heretick; And therefore, as he believeth Devotion to be misplaced, when it getteth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Conventicle, he concludeth that Loyalty is so too, when it is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108761:12"/>
lodged in a drunken Club. These vertues deserve a better seat of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and they are degraded when such men undertake their defence, as have too great need of an Apology for themselves. Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> wisheth that some knowledge may go along with Zeal on the right side; and that those that are in possession of the Pulpit, would Quot at least as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Authority of the Scriptures, as they do that of the State. There are many, who borrow too often from the Government Arms to use against their Adversaries, and neglect those that are more proper, and would be more powerful. A Divine groweth less, and putteth a Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution upon his own Character, when he Quoteth any Law but that of <hi>God Almighty,</hi> to get the better of those that contest with him; And as it is a sign of a decaying Constitution, when nature with good dyet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expel noxious humours, without calling Forraign Drugs to her Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, so it looketh like want of Health in a Church, when instead of depending upon the power of that Truth which it holdeth, and the good example of those who teach it, to support it self and suppress Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rrors, it should have a perpetual recourse to the Secular Authority, and even, upon the slightest occasions. Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> hath his Objections to the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> busied diligence and overdoing of some of the Dissenting Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and he doth as little Approve those of our Church who weare <hi>God Almightie's</hi> Livery, as some old Warders in the Tower do the King's: who do nothing that belongs unto their place, but receiving the wages for it. He thinketh that the Liberty of the late times gave men to much Light, and diffused it so Universally among the People, that they are not now to be dealt with, as they might have been in an Age of less enquity And therefore tho in some well chosen and dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Auditories, good resolute Non-sense backed with Authority may prevail, yet generally Men are become so good Judges of what they hear, that the Clergy ought to be very warry, before they go about to impose upon their understandings, which are grown less humble than they were in former times, when the Men in Black had made Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a Sin for the Laity, that for fear of offending they made a Conscience of being able to read. But now the World is grown so wise, and expecteth Reasons, and good ones too, before they give up their own Opinions to other Men's Dictates, tho' never so Magisterially delivered to them. And our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is farr from approving they Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie which seemeth to be the Reigning Vice among some of the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting Clergy</hi>; He thinketh it the most provoking Sin men can be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of in Relation to Heaven, and yet (which may seem strange) that

No Man doth less approve the ill-bred Method of some of the Dissenters in Rebuking Authority, who behave themselves as if they thought ill manners necessary to Salvation; yet he cannot but distinguish and desire a mean between the of some of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Apostles and the indecent Courtship of some silken Divines, who one would think did practice to bow at the Altar, only to learn to make the better legs at Court. Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> approveth the principle of our Church, That <hi>Dominion is not founded in Grace</hi>; And that our <hi>obedience is to be given to a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish King</hi> in other things, at the same time that our compl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is so far from relishing the impertinent wanderings of these who pour out long prayers upon the Congregation, and all from their own flock, which GOD knoweth for the most part is a barren soil, that produceth weeds in stead of flowers; And by this means they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Religion</hi> it self, rather than promote Mens Devotions.

powerful utterance too, hath enabled them to gush out upon the attentive Authority, with a mighty stream of Devout and Unaffected Eloquence: When a Man is qualified and endued with Learning, and above all, adorned with a good Life, breaking out into a warm and well delivered prayer before his Sermon, it hath appearance of a Divine Rapture, he raiseth and leadeth the hearts of an Assembly in another manner, than most studied, best composed <hi>form of set Words</hi> can attain to, &amp; the <hi>Pray <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <head>THE TRIMMERS Opinion Concerning PAPISTS.</head>
            <p>To speak of <hi>Popery</hi> leadeth one into such a Sea of matter, that it is not easie to forebear lanching in it being invited, by such a fruithful Theme, and by a variety never to be exhausted; But to confine it to the present subject, I will only say a short word of <hi>Religion</hi> it self, of its
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108761:14"/>
influence here at this time, And of our <hi>Trimmer's</hi> Opinion in relation of our manner of living with them. If a Man would speak maliciously of this Religion; One might say it is like these Diseases, where as long as one drop of the infection remaineth, there is still a danger of having the whole mass of Blood corrupted by it. In <hi>Swedland</hi> there was an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute cure, and nothing of <hi>Popery</hi> heard of till Queen <hi>Christian</hi> (whether moved by Arguments of this or the other World, would not be good manners to enquire) thought fit to change her Religion, and her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to live at <hi>Rome,</hi> where she might find better Judges of her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and less ungentle censures of those Princely Liberties she was some<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>time deposed to, when she lived at <hi>Stockholm</hi> where the good breeding of the Climat is much inferiour to that of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as the civility of the <hi>Religion:</hi> And the <hi>Cardinals</hi> having refined the <hi>Church</hi> from these <hi>clownish methods</hi> the <hi>Fisher-Men</hi> had first introduced, &amp; mended that <hi>Pattern</hi> so effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, that a Man of that Age, if he should now come into the World, would not possibly know it. In <hi>Denmark</hi> the <hi>Reformation</hi> was intire. In some <hi>States of Germany</hi> as well as <hi>Geneva,</hi> the cure was universal. But in the rest of the World, where the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> took place, the <hi>Popish hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> was too tough to be totally expelled; And so it was in <hi>England,</hi> tho' the change was made with all the Advantage imaginable to the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> it being countenanced and introduced by <hi>Legal Authority,</hi> and by that means perhaps have been as perfect as in any other place, if the short Reign of <hi>Edward the 6th,</hi> and the succession of a <hi>Popish Queen,</hi> had not given such advantage to that <hi>Religion,</hi> that it hath subsisted ever since under all the hardships that have been put upon it, it hath been a closs compact Body, and made the more so by their sufferings, it was not strong enough to prevail, but it was still able with the help of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign support to carry on an interest which gave the Crown trouble to make a considerable, not to say a dangerous, figure in the Nation, so much as this would not have been without some hopes, nor these hopes kept up, without some considerable grounds.</p>
            <p>In Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time, the <hi>Spanish zeal</hi> of their <hi>Religion,</hi> and their Revenge for (88) gave warmth to the <hi>Papists</hi> here; And above all, the Right of the Queen of <hi>SCOTS</hi> to succeed, was whilst she lived, sufficient to give them a better prospect of their Affairs. In King <hi>James</hi> time, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Match and his Gentleness towards them, kept them up, which they were ready to interpret more in their Favours, than was either rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, or then became them, so little tenderness they have where it is most due, if the interest of their <hi>Religion</hi> come in competition with it. As for the last King, tho' he gave the most glorious Evidence, that ever
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108761:15"/>
Man did of his being <hi>Protestant,</hi> yet by the more then ordinary influence the Queen was thought to have over him, and it so happening, that the greater part of his anger was direct against the <hi>Puritans,</hi> there was such an Advantage given to Men disposed to suspect, that they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to interpret it a <hi>leaning towards Popery,</hi> without which handl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, it was morally impossible that the ill affected part of the Nation could ever have seduced the rest unto Rebellion; That which helped to confirm many well meaning Men in their misapprehensions of the King, was the long and unusual intermissions of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> so that every year that passed without one, made up a new Argument to increase their suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and made them presume that the <hi>papists</hi> had a principal hand in keeping of them off: This raised such heat in Mens minds, to think that Men who were obnoxious to the Laws, instead of being punished, should have credit enough even to secure themselves, even at the price of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying the <hi>fundamental Constitutions,</hi> that it broke out into a flame, which before it could be quenched, had almost reduced the Nation to ashes. Amongst the miserable effects of that <hi>unnatural Warr,</hi> none hath been more fatal to Us, than the forcing our Princes to breath in an other Air, and to receive the Earthly impression of a Forraign Education. The barbarity of the <hi>English</hi> toward their King, and the Royal Family, might very well tempt him to think the better of every thing be found abroad, and might naturally produce more g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ntleness towards a Religion, by which he was Hospitally received, at the same time he was thrown off, and persecuted by the <hi>Protestants</hi> tho' his own Subjects too, to aggravate the Offence. The Queen Mother (as generally Ladies do) with Age grew more devout, and earnest in her Religion, and besides the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Rewards of getting larger subsidies from the <hi>French Clergie,</hi> she had Motives of another kind to perswade her to shew her zeal: And since by the <hi>Roman Dispensatory,</hi> a Soul converted to the Church, is a soveraign Remedy, and layeth up a mighty stock of <hi>Merit</hi>; She was also solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to secure her self in all events, and therefore first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

'Tis believed she had better success with another of her Sons, who if he was not quite brought off from <hi>our Religion,</hi> at least such beginnings were made, as made them very easie to be finished; his being of a Generous and Aspiring Nature, and in that respect less patient

the Drugery of Arguing; might propably help to recommend a <hi>Church</hi> to him, that exempteth the <hi>Laytie</hi> from the vexation of enquiring; Perhaps he might (tho' by mistake) look upon that Religion as more Favourable to the enlarged power of a <hi>King,</hi> a consideration that might have its weight with a young Prince in his warm blood, and that was brought up in Armies. I cannot hinder my self from a small Digression to consider with Admiration: That this <hi>old Lady of Rome,</hi> with all her wrinkles should yet have Charms able to subdue great Princes, so far from handsome, and yet so Imperious, so painted and yet so pretending, after having Abused, Destroyed and Murdered so many of her Lovers, she still findeth others glad of her new Charms: A thing so strange to indifferent Judges, that those who will allow no other Miracles in the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> must needs grant that this is one not to be contested. She sitteth in her shop, and selleth at dare Rates, her Rattles and her Hoby-Horses, whilst the deluded World still continueth to furnish her with Customers. But whether am I carried with this Contemplation. It is high time to return to my Text, and to consider the wonderful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the King's coming home again, led by the hand of Heaven, and called by the voice of his People, who received him, with a joy equall to the blessings which his Restoration brought along with it. By this there was an end put to the Hopes, some might have abroad, of make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing use of his less happy circumstances, to throw him into Forreign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests or opinions, which had been wholly inconsistent with our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, our Laws and all other things that are dear to us; yet with all this, something of those Tinctures and Impressions, might so far Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, as tho' they were very Innocent in him, yet they might have ill Effect here, by softning the Animosity which seemeth necessary to the <hi>Defender of the Protestant Faith,</hi> in opposition to such a powerfull and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable Enemy. You may be sure, that among all other sort of Men who applyed themselves to the King, at his first coming for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, the <hi>Papists</hi> were not the last, nor (as they fain would have flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered themselves) the least welcome, having their past sufferings a swell as their present professions to Recommend them: Since so it happened, That the <hi>Indulgence promised</hi> to <hi>Dissenters</hi> at <hi>Breda,</hi> was carried on in such a manner, that the <hi>Papists</hi> were to divide with them. And though the Parliament, notwithstanding its Resignation to the <hi>Crown</hi> in all other things, rejected with Scorn and Anger, a Declaration formed for this purpose, yet the Birth and Steps of it gave such an Alarm, that Mens Suspicions once raised were not easily laid a sleep again. To omit other things, <hi>the breach of the Triple League,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch Warr,</hi> with its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinences,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:108761:16"/>
raised Jealousies to the highest pitch imaginable; and fed the hopes of one partie, and the Fears of the other to such a Degree, that some very Critical Resolutions were generally expected: when the ill Success of that <hi>Warr,</hi> and the sacrifice <hi>France</hi> thought fit to make of the <hi>Papists</hi> here to their own Interest abroad, gave another checkt, and the Act of enjoining the <hi>Test to all in Office,</hi> was thought no ill Bargan to the Nation, tho bought at the price of 1200000 <hi>lib.</hi> and the Mony ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the continuance of the Warr against the <hi>Dutch,</hi> then which nothing could be more unpopular or less approved. Notwithstanding these Discouragements, <hi>Popery</hi> is a plant which may be mowed down, but the root will still remain, and in spight of the Laws, it will sprout up and grow again, especially if it should happen, that there will ever be Men in power, who in stead of Weeding it out of our Garden, will take cae to cherish it, and keep it alive And tho the <hi>Law of Excluding</hi> them from places, was to tolerably kept, as to the outward form, yet there were many Circumstances which being improved by the quick sighted Malice of ill affected Men, did keep up the <hi>World</hi> in their suspicions, and blow up Jealousies to such a hight, both in and out of Parliament, that the remembrance of them is very unpleasant, and the Examples so Extravagant, that it is hoped in our age, nothing like it will be attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted.</p>
            <p>But to come closer to the Case in Question, in this condition we stand with the <hi>Papists,</hi> what shall now be done according to our <hi>Trimmers</hi> opinion, in Order to the Better bearing this Grievance; since as I have said before there is no hope of being intirely freed from it. <hi>Papists</hi> we must have among us, and if their Religion keepeth them from bringing Honey to the Hyve, let the <hi>Government try, at lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Others look upon it as the better Scutcheon, the more ancient Religion of the two; and as some men of good Pedegree will despise meanner men, tho ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so much Superior to them by Nature: So those undervalue the Reformation as an upstart, and think that there is more Honour in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting an old Error, them embracing what seemeth to them a new Truth.

adviseable, nor at all agreeing with the Rules of Governing Prudence, to provoke Men by hardships to forget that Nature which else is sure to be on our side. When these Men by fair usage are put again into their Right Senses they will have quite differing Reflections from those which Rigor and Persecution had raised in them.

               </gap>apned to be Superior to any one of them, by the choice we had of throwing the Scales on that side to which we gave our Friendship. And we do not know whether this figure did not make us great as our former Conquests, to be a perpetual Umpire between the two great contending Powers, who gave us all their Courship, and offered all their Incense at our Altar, whilst their fat seemed to depend upon the Oracles we delivered. For a King of <hi>England</hi> to sit on his Throne (as in a Supreme Court of Justice with the last Appeal of two great Monarchs pleading their cause, and expecting the sentence Declaring which side was on the Right, or at least (if we pleased) which side should have the better of it) was a piece of greatn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But by a fatality upon our Councils, or by the refined Policy of this latter Age, we have thought fit to use Industry to destroy this mighty Power which we had so long enjoyed; and that equality between the two Monarchs which we might for ever have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, hath been chiefly broken by us, whose interest above all things it was to have maintained it. When one of them like the overflowing of the Sea, had gained more upon the other then our conveniencie or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed our safety would allow, instead of mending the Banks or making new ones, we our selves with our own hands helped to cut them, to invite and make way for a farther inu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Gondemar</hi> was as Saucy and as powerful too in K: <hi>Iame's</hi> his Court, as any <hi>French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador</hi> can have been in any time since; Men talked as wrong then on the <hi>Spanish</hi> side, and made their Court as well by it, as any can have done since by talking as much for the <hi>French.</hi> So that from that time, instead of weighing in a false Ballance the power of either Crowns, it looketh as if we had learned only to weigh the pensions and take the heaviest. It would be tedious as well as unwelcome to recapitulat all our wrong steps, so that I will go no farther than the King's Restorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108761:19"/>
at which time the Ballance was on the side of <hi>France,</hi> and that by the means of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who for a separate Interest of his own, had sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed that of the Nation, by joyning with the stronger side to suppress the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> which he ought to have supported: Such a method was natural enough to an Usurper, and shewed he was not the Lawful Father of the People, by having so li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But to go on, here cometh the King followed with Courtship, from all Nations Abroad; of which, some did it, not only to make him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get how familiarly they had used him whilst he was in other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, but to bespeak the Friendship of a Prince, who besides his other greatness was yet more Considerable by being re established by the Love of his People. <hi>France</hi> had an interest either to dispose us to so much good will, or at least to put us in such a condition, that we might give no Opposition to their Designs: And <hi>Flanders</hi> being a perpetual Object in their Eye, a lasting Beauty for which they have an incurable Passion, and not being kind enough to consent to them, they meditat to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Rape upon her; which they thought would not be easie to do, whilst <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> were agreed to rescue her, when ever they should hear cry out for help to them. To this end they put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice seasonable and Artificial Whispers to widen things between us and the States; <hi>Amboyna,</hi> and the <hi>Fishery</hi> must be talked of here; the Freedom of the Seas, and the preservation of Trade insinuated there, and their being Combustible matter on both sides, in a little time it took fire, which gave those that kindled it sufficient cause to smile, and hug themselves to see us both fall into the Net, they had laid for us. And it is observable and of good example to us if we will take it, that their design being to set us together at cuffs to weaken us, they kept themselves indifferent and lookers on, till our Victories begun to break the Ballance: And then the King of <hi>France</hi> like a wise Prince was resolved to support the beaten side, and would no more let the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Sea, than we ought to suffer the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> to fall into one Hand. In pursuance to this, he took part with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and in a little time made himself Umpire of the Peace between Us. Sometime after upon a pretence of his <hi>Queen's</hi> Title to a part of <hi>Flanders</hi> by right of <hi>Devolution,</hi> he falleth into it with a mighty Force, for which the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> were so little prepared, that he made a very swift progress, and had such a Torrent of indisputed Victory, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

with the apprehension of so near a Danger to them, thought it necessary for their own Defence to make up a sudden League (into which <hi>Sweden</hi> was taken in) to interpose for a Peace between the two <hi>Crowns.</hi> This had so good an Effect, that <hi>France</hi> was stopped in its Career, and the peace of <hi>Aix la Chapel</hi> was a little after concluded: It was a forced putt, and the <hi>French</hi> wisely dissembled their Dissatisfactions; yet from the very moment, they re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Amongst the other Means used to attain this end, the sending over the <hi>Dutches of Orleans,</hi> was not the least powerful; she was a very welcome Guest here, and her own Charms and Dexterity joyned with all other Advantages which might help her perswations, gave her such an Ascendent, that she could hardly fail of success.

When at the same time he doth us more honour then we deserved, he layeth a greater share of the blame upon our shoulders then did naturally belong to us. The particulars of that War; our part in whilst we sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Only the wisdom of <hi>France</hi> is in this to be observed, that when we had made a separate Peace, which left them single to oppose the united force of the Confederates, they were so far from being Angry, That they would not so much as shew the least coldness, hoping to get as much by our Mediation for a Peace as they would have expected from our Assistance in the War, our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances at that time considered. This seasonable peace of Indulgence in not Reproaching us, but rather allowing those necessities of State, which we gave for our excuse, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uch an ingaging method, that it went a great way to <hi>keep us still in his chains,</hi> when to the eye of the World, we had Absolutely broken loose from them; And by what passed afterwards at <hi>Nemeghen,</hi> tho' the Kings Neutrality gave him the figure of a Mediator, it appeared that his Interposition was extremely suspected of partiality by the Confederats, who upon that ground did both at, and before the conclusion of the Treatie, treate his <hi>Ministers</hi> there with a great dale of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect. In this peace as well as that of the <hi>Pireneans,</hi> and of <hi>Aix la Chapel,</hi> the K: of <hi>France</hi> at the moment of making, had the thoughts of breaking of it; for a very little time after he broached his pretentions upon <hi>A Lost, &amp;c.</hi> Things had they been offered by a less formidable hand, would have been smiled at. But ill Arguments being seconded with good Armies, carry such a power with them, that naked Sense is a very unequal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary: It was thought that those Airie Claims were rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the getting of <hi>Luxenburgh</hi> for the Equivalent; and this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was confirmed by the blocking it up after pretending to the <hi>County of Chimay</hi>; and that it might be intirely surrendred to the <hi>French Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi> it was so pressed that it most have fallen in a little time, if the King of <hi>France</hi> had not sent Orders to his Troops to retire, and his <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian generosity</hi> which was assigned for the Reason of it, made the World smile, since it was seen how differently his devout Zeal worketh in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie.</hi> That sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At <hi>Ratisbone</hi> his most <hi>Christian Majestie</hi> taketh the Liberties of all the <hi>Electors</hi> and <hi>free States</hi> into his immediate protection, and telleth them the <hi>Emperor is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Man,</hi> an <hi>aspiring Hero,</hi> that would infallibly devour them, if he was not at hand to resist him in their behalf: But above all, in <hi>Holland</hi> he hath the most oblidging tenderness for the <hi>Common wealth,</hi> and is in such Disquiets lest it should be invaded by the <hi>Prince of Orange,</hi> that they can do no less in gratitude than to undoe themselves when he biddeth, to shew how sensible they are of his good Nature. Yet in spite of all these Contradictions, there are in the World such very refin'd States Men, as will upon their Credit affirm the following <hi>paradoxes</hi> to be real Truths. First, That <hi>France</hi> alone is sincere, and keepeth its Faith; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that it is the only Friend we can rely upon. That the King of <hi>France of all Men living hath the lest mind to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Conqueror;</hi> That he is a sleepy Tame Creature, void of all Ambition, a poor kind of a Man, <hi>that hath no further thought than of being quiet.</hi> That he is charmed by his <hi>Friendship</hi> to Us, that it is impossible he should ever do us hurt: And therefore tho <hi>Flanders</hi> was lost, it should not in the least concern Us. That he would fain help the <hi>Crown of England</hi> to be Absolute,</hi> which would be to take pains to put Us in a condition to oppose him; as it is and must be our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest as long as he continues in such an overballancing greatness. Such a <hi>Creed</hi> as this, if once received, might prepare our Belief for greater things: And as he that taught Men to eat a Dagger, began first with a Pen knife; so if We can be prevailed with to digest these smaller mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes, we may at last make our Stomacks strong enough for that of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> cannot easily be converted out of his Senses by these <hi>State Sophisters,</hi> and yet he hath no such <hi>peevish obstinacy,</hi> as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all Correspondence with <hi>France,</hi> because We ought to be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of the too great power of it. He would not have the Kings Friendship to the <hi>Confederates</hi> extend to the involving him in any <hi>unreasonable</hi> or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Engagements, neither would he have him lay aside the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of his better Establishment at home, out of an excessive zeal to secure his Allies Abroad; But sure there might be a mean between the two opposite Extremes, and it may be wished that our Friendship with <hi>France</hi> should at least be so bounded, that it may consist with the

Honour as well as with the Interest of <hi>England.</hi> There is no Woman but hath her Fears of contracting too great an Intimacie with a much greater Beauty, because it exposed her too often to a comparison that is not advantagious to her: and sure it may become a Prince to be as Jealous of his Digntty, as a Lady <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when <hi>England</hi> might Ride Admiral at the Head of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, to look like an Kitchin Yaught to the <hi>Grand Lewis,</hi> is but a scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Figure for us to make in the Mapp of Christendom; it would rise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our <hi>Trimmers</hi> stomach if ever (which God forbid) the power of Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Intermitting <hi>Parliaments</hi> here, should be transferred to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and that all the opportunities of our Settlements at Home, should give way to their Degsins and Projects Abroad; and that our Interest should be so far sacrificed to our humour, that all the Omnipotence of <hi>France,</hi> can never make us full amends for it. In the mean time, he shrinketh at the dismal Prospect he can by no means drive away from his thoughts, that when <hi>France</hi> hath gathered all the Fruit arising from our mistakes, and that we can bear no more, they they will cut down the Tree and throw it into the fire. All this while some Superfine Statesmen to comfort us, would fain perswade the world, that this or that Accident may save us, and all which is or ought to be dear to us, would have us rely meerly upon Chance, not considering that Fortune is Wisdoms <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Tho' the Nation was lavish of their Kindness to him at his first coming, yet there remaineth still a stock of warmth in Mens Hearts for him, besides the good influences of his happy Planet are not yet all spent: And tho' the Stars of Men past their Youth are generally declining, and have less Force, like Eyes of decaying Beauties; Yet, by a ble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Whose Gentleness giveth him a <hi>Natural Dominion</hi> that hath no bounds, with such a Noble mixture of Greatness and Condescention, an engaging look that disarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Men of their ill Humour, and their Resentments, something in him that wanteth a name, and can no more be defined than it can be resisted, a gift of Heaven of its last finishing, where it will be peculiarly kind! The only Prince in the World that dares be familiar, or that hath right to Triumph over those forms which were first invented to give aw to those that could not Judge, and to hid Defects from those that could: A Prince that hath exhausted himself by his Liberality, and endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself by his Mercy, who only shineth by his own Light, and by his natural vertues excelleth all the varnish of studied Acquisitions; his faults are like shades to a good picture, or like Allay to Gold to make it more useful; he may have some, but for any man to see them through so many Reconciling vertues, is a Sacrilegious piece of ill nature, of which no generous mind can be guilty. A Prince that deserveth to be loved for his own sake, even without the helps of a Comparison, our love, our duty, and our danger, all join to cement our Obedience to him: In short whatever he can do, it is no more possible for us to be angry with him, than with the bank that secureth us from the raging Sea, the kind shade that hideth us from the scortching Sun, the welcome hand that reacheth us a Reprive, or with the Guardian Angel that rescueth our Soul from the devouring Jaws of wretched Eternity.</p>

            <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>TO Conclude, Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is so fully satisfied of the Truth of those Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by which he is directed in reference to the publick, that he will neither be Bauled, Threatned, Laughed, nor Drunk out of them; and instead of being Convicted by the Arguments of his Adversaries to their Opinion he is very much confirmed in his own by them. He professeth Solemnly that were it in his Power to choose, be rather have had his Ambition bounded by the Commandments of a Wise and Great Master, then let it Range with a Popular Licence, tho' Crowned with Success. Yet he cannot commit such a sin against the Glorious thing called Libertie, or let his Soul stoop so much below it self, as to be content without repining to have his reason intirely subdued, or the Priviledge of Acting like a sensible Creature torn from him by the Imperious Dictates of unlimited Authority, in what hands soever it happeneth to be placed. What is there in this, that is so Criminal as to deserve the penalty of that most singular Apothegm, <q>A Trimmer is worse than a Rebel?</q> What do angry Men aile to rail so against <hi>Moderation</hi>? Doth it not look as if they were going to some Scurvie Extreme, that is too strong to be digest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the more considering part of Mankind. These <hi>Arbitrary Methods,</hi> besides the unjustice of them are, GOD bethanked, very unskilful too, for they fright the Birds by talking so loud from coming into the net that is laid for them. When Men agree to riffle a house, they seldom give warning, or blow a Trumpet; but there are some small <hi>States Men</hi> who are so full charged with their own expectations, that they cannot contain; and kind Heaven by sending such a seasonable case upon their Understandings, hath made their <hi>Ignorance</hi> an Antidote against their <hi>Malice</hi>; some of these cannot treat peaceably, yeelding will not satisfie them, they will have Men by storm. There are others who must have plots to make their service necessary, and have an Interest to keep them alive since they are to live upon them; These Men would perswade the King to Retrench his own greatness, so as to shrink into the Head of a party, which is a betraying him into such an un-Princely mistake, and into such a wilful diminution of himself, that they are the last Enemies he ought to allow himself to forgive. Such Men, if they could, would prevail with the Sun to shine only upon them and their Friends, and to have all the rest of the World in the dark. This is a very unusual Monopoly, and may come within the Equity of the Law, which maketh it Treason to imprison the King, when such unfitting bounds are put to his Favour, and be confined to the narrow circle of a particular

Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> therefore inspired by this <hi>Divine Vertue,</hi> thinketh fit to conclude with these Assertions, That our Clymat is a <hi>Trimmer</hi> between that part of the World where Men <hi>are roasted, and the other where they are frozen</hi>: That <hi>our Church is a Trimmer</hi> between the <hi>phrenzie of Phanatick Visions,</hi> and the <hi>Lethargick ignorance</hi> of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish dreams.</hi> That Our Laws are <hi>Trimmers</hi> between the Excesses of unbounded power, and the Extravagance of Liberty not enough restrained. That true Vertue hath ever been thought a <hi>Trimmer,</hi> and to have its dwelling in the midle between the two Extremes; That even <hi>GOD Almighty Himself</hi> is divided between his two great Attributes, <hi>His Mercy,</hi> and <hi>His Justice.</hi>
