            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Authoritie, stiled the
Authors owne funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
Most fitly: whether
wee respect the time, or the
matter. It was preached not many dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his death; as if, hauing done this, there
remained nothing for him to doe, but to die:
And the matter is, of Death; the occasion and
subiect of all funerall Sermons. It hath beene
obserued of this Reuerend Man, That his
Faculty in Preaching continually encreased:
and, That as hee exceeded others at first; so,
at last hee exceeded himselfe. This is his last
Sermon; I will not say, it is therefore his best;
because, all his were excellent. Yet thus much:
A dying Mans words, if they concerne our
<pb facs="tcp:2537:4"/>
selues; doe vsually make the deepest impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
as being spoken most feelingly, and with
least affectation. Now, whom doth it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
to learn, both the danger, and benefit of
death? Death is euery mans enemy, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
hurt to all; though to many, hee be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of greatest goods. This enemy we must
all combate dying; whom hee liuing did almost
conquer; hauing discouered the vtmost of his
power, the vtmost of his crueltie. May wee

most ordinary acceptation of these words,
and that vpon which our <hi>translation</hi> laies

our death:</hi> what kinde of <hi>issue</hi> and <hi>transmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration</hi>
wee shall haue out of this world,
whether prepared or sudden, whether
violent or naturall, whether in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
senses or shaken and disordered by
sicknes, there is no condemnation to bee
argued out of that, no Iudgement to bee
made vpon that, for how soeuer they dye,
<hi>precious in his sight is the death of his saints,</hi>
and with him are <hi>the issues of death,</hi> the
<hi>wayes</hi> of our <hi>departing</hi> out of this <hi>life</hi> are in
his <hi>hands.</hi> And so in this <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>words,</hi>
this <hi>exitus mortis,</hi> the <hi>issues of death,</hi> is <hi>libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio

be. And in this <hi>sense</hi> and acceptation of the
<hi>words,</hi> the naturall frame and contexture
doth well and pregnantly administer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <hi>our God</hi> is the <hi>God of all saluations,</hi> consists

this sense, this <hi>exitus mortis,</hi> this <hi>issue of

by death,</hi> by the death of this <hi>God</hi> our <hi>Lord
Christ Iesus.</hi> And this is Saint <hi>Augustines</hi>
acceptation of the words, and those many

looke vpon these words; <hi>First,</hi> as the <hi>God</hi>

which are deliuered in the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to
be vpon me, when I finde that reall <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi>

Christ</hi> determines himself in that, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

(such are the <hi>reuolutions</hi> of the <hi>graues</hi>) bee
mingled with the dust of euery high way,

<hi>they did liue:</hi> But in that case there were

It may bee the dust of <hi>another</hi> man, that

and yet how small a matter made hee of

that was that, the <hi>serpent</hi> should <hi>practise</hi>

Saint <hi>Marke</hi> tells vs,<note place="margin">Mar. 9. 4.</note> but what they talkt
of onely S. <hi>Luke, Dicebant excessum eius,</hi>
says he,<note place="margin">Luke 9. 31.</note> 
               <hi>they talkt of his decease,</hi> of <hi>his death</hi>
which <hi>was to be accomplished</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
The <hi>word</hi> is of his <hi>Exodus,</hi> the very word
of our <hi>text exitus,</hi> his <hi>issue by death. Moses</hi>
who in his <hi>Exodus</hi> had <hi>prefigured</hi> this <hi>issue
of our Lord,</hi> and in passing <hi>Israel</hi> out of
<hi>Egypt</hi> through the <hi>red Sea,</hi> had foretold in
that actuall <hi>prophesie, Christ passing</hi> of <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
through</hi> the <hi>sea</hi> of his <hi>blood.</hi> And <hi>Elias,</hi>
whose <hi>Exodus</hi> and <hi>issue out of</hi> this <hi>world</hi>
was a <hi>figure</hi> of <hi>Christs ascension,</hi> had no
doubt a great satisfaction in <hi>talking</hi> with
our <hi>blessed Lord de excessueius,</hi> of the <hi>full
consummation</hi> of <hi>all this</hi> in <hi>his death,</hi> which
was to bee <hi>accomplished</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Our
<hi>meditation</hi> of his <hi>death</hi> should be more <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerall</hi>
and affect vs more because it is of a
thing already done. The ancient <hi>Romanes</hi>
had a certain terdernesse and detestation
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2537:22"/>
of the name of death, they cold not name
death, no, not in their wills. There they
could not say <hi>Si mori contigerit,</hi> but <hi>si quid
humanitus contingat,</hi> nor if, or when I dye,
but when the course of nature is accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
vpon me. To vs that speake dayly of
the <hi>death</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> (he was <hi>crucified, dead</hi>
and <hi>buried)</hi> can the memory or the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our owne <hi>death</hi> bee yrkesome or
bitter? There are in these latter times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
vs, that name death frely enogh,
and the death of <hi>God,</hi> but in <hi>blasphemous
oathes</hi> &amp; <hi>execrations.</hi> Miserable men, who
shall therefore bee sayd neuer to haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Iesus,</hi> because they haue named him
<hi>too often.</hi> And therfore heare <hi>Iesus</hi> say, <hi>Ne
sciui vos,</hi> I <hi>neuer knew you,</hi> because they
made themselues <hi>too familiar</hi> with him.
<hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> talkt with <hi>Christ</hi> of his
<hi>death,</hi> only, in <hi>a holy</hi> and <hi>ioyfull sense</hi> of the
<hi>benefit</hi> which <hi>they</hi> and <hi>all</hi> the world were
to <hi>receiue by that. Discourses</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi>
should not be <hi>out</hi> of <hi>curiosity,</hi> but to <hi>edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they talkt with <hi>Christ</hi> of his
<hi>death</hi> at that time, when he was in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2537:22"/>
               <hi>height</hi> of <hi>glory</hi> that euer he admitted in

wee are afraid to speake to the <hi>great men</hi> of

<hi>immutability.</hi> But <hi>bonum est nobis esse hic</hi> (as
