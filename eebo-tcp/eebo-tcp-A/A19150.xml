         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For as the intents were good, which <hi>Marcellus</hi> foſtered, but no effects followed, nay rather his Nephew drawes now backe moſt of all, and mainly oppoſes his Vnckles determinations: So we read, that the Cardinalls in fauour of his perſon (becauſe repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted honeſt, and well be loued amongst them) decreed to haue his charges of the direption of his houſe and houſhold ſtuffe, (a graue cuſtome no doubt, and worthie of <hi>Chriſts Vicar,</hi> to haue all ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled, and ranſackt, that the people can but lay hands of, when he is choſen Pope) to be repaid him of the publique; but it was neuer done (ſaith the <hi>Hiſtorian)</hi> till this day.</p>
            <p>But to leaue the <hi>Vnckle</hi> (ſith our queſtion is not whether the Popes may keepe guards about their perſons, but whether <hi>Kings</hi> crownes, or (if that be more deare) their liues are to be wholly at the Popes dispoſing) and to returne to the <hi>Nephew;</hi> He is peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, as I ſaid, in his moſt mortified Treatiſe, and the fore-runner of his ende (as he would haue it thought at leaſt) that <hi>Kings</hi> are

ſubiect to murther, at beſt: Firſt, <hi>de facto;</hi> though the Scripture as it flatters not, nor no where diuerts vs from the conſideration of our mortality, ſo it leades vs to ſpeake of <hi>KINGS</hi> and Princes in another ſtraine; as if they that ought not to be violated by any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall hand, could not die at all, or at leaſt not die, till God himſelfe aſſoild them of the bands of this bodie. <hi>How was he ſlaine</hi> (ſaies <hi>Dauid</hi> of <hi>Saul) as if he had not beene annointed with oyle?</hi> And, <hi>O King, liue for euer,</hi> ſaies the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> not any courtly flatterer. The <hi>Kings ſoule is bound vp with God in the bundle of life,</hi> as it were <hi>Gero in ſinu, nec diſcingor;</hi> faſt bound, and not to ſhedde out. The period of their gouernment, is <hi>cum Sole &amp; Luna,</hi> as <hi>long as the Sunne and Moone endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</hi> And though <hi>they die like men,</hi> (that is, <hi>quatenus homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, non quatenus Reges)</hi> yet we are to remember, that <hi>they fall like one of the PRINCIPES,</hi> that is, one of the <hi>Angels</hi> (ſaies the <hi>Cardinall</hi> himſelfe, among others, vpon that <hi>Pſalme)</hi> who we know are not iudged, till <hi>GOD</hi> iudges them: though, no doubt but that aggrauates their iudgement ſo much the forer.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Scripture ſo often, entitles the conſtitution of <hi>Kings</hi> to <hi>GOD,</hi> it may be it is to ſhew, that their authoritie is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abrogable; as the <hi>Platoniques</hi> hold opinion, that whatſoeuer is mortall, was produced by ſome mediation of the vile creature, as man of the duſt, moſt things of the <hi>materia prima, &amp;c.</hi> but that which immediatly proceedes of God himſelfe, as the ſoules of men, and the Angells, and the heauens, they are immortall.

Firſt, <hi>Some things there are ſeeming to belong to Peter, which can make no cleare ſenſe, but when they are conſtrued of the Church.</hi> This is flat againſt you, that would haue <hi>Peter</hi> ſuch a figure of the Church forſooth, as yet to occupy a certain place of his owne, and what is giuen to <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be giuen to the Church, and what to the Church, the ſame to <hi>Peter.</hi> But <hi>ſome things,</hi> ſaies S. <hi>Auſten, are ſaid to Peter</hi> which can haue no pregnant conſtruction <hi>but of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, amidſt thoſe ſome things, is, <hi>Tibi dabo claues.</hi> S. <hi>Auſten</hi> vſeth this very example; which you would fain haue to be ingroſſed by <hi>Peter,</hi> as if the keyes had perſonally beene deliuered to him, and in his owne right: which S. <hi>Auſten</hi> denies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Si qua alia, if there be any more.</hi> There may bee more then, as, <hi>Paſce oues.</hi> No doubt this muſt be one; by his owne expoſition before, <hi>de Agone Chriſtiano, c.</hi> 30.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that he bare indeed <hi>perſonam eccleſiae,</hi> but <hi>in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurâ,</hi> which you had pared off. Not by power of his place, or authoritie permanent; but culld out before the reſt by our Lord for that end, to ſignifie vnitie.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that <hi>primatus</hi> was not the primacie of magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, euen that declares; that he ſaies, the keyes were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to him <hi>propter primatum.</hi> So that firſt the primacie, then the keyes. And his primacie among the Apoſtles was a motiue-cauſe to promiſe him the keies in the name of the Church: whereas elſe <hi>primatus</hi> and the <hi>keies</hi> had gone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and as ſoone as <hi>primatus,</hi> ſo ſoone the <hi>keies.</hi> But
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:25255:30"/>
now they are promiſed <hi>him</hi> for ſome ſpecialty in him. Not for office then, as you would haue it.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, as <hi>Iudas</hi> ſuſtained the perſon of the wicked, <hi>(ſuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuit,</hi> a more powerfull word then <hi>geſtauit,</hi> and much more then <hi>ſignificauit,</hi> which is ſaid here of <hi>Peter,</hi> and yet but <hi>quodam modo,</hi> ſo ſhie is S. <hi>Auſten,</hi> ſo farre from the iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that you build vpon <hi>Tullies Offices)</hi> ſo <hi>Peter</hi> of the Church. As <hi>Iudas</hi> of the one, ſo <hi>Peter</hi> of the other, ſaith S. <hi>Auſten:</hi> which is no authoritatiue primacie, you may bee ſure, vnleſſe <hi>Iudas</hi> ſhall haue a generation of Succeſſors now, as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> and (which is more damnable) of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures inſtitution. If any ſuch were, who more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then the Pope, that holds by the purſe which <hi>Iudas</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and troubles all the world for Supremacy in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls? But neither <hi>Iudas</hi> then, nor the Pope now. Elſe <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſhould haue been head, vnder <hi>Iudas,</hi> his head, (doe you like this?) when he went ſo farre as to ſcandalize our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and deſerued the name of Sathan at his hands. Was <hi>Peter</hi> then vnder <hi>Iudas</hi> his iuriſdiction? yet, no doubt far gone in that part, which <hi>Iudas</hi> bare the perſon of, by S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens</hi> ſaying. For ſo we read in his <hi>Alia expoſitio</hi> of the ſame Pſalme: <hi>Cuius populi diximus Iudam in figurâ geſſiſſe perſonam, ſicut eccleſiae geſſit Apoſtolus Petrus.</hi> Your grauitie perhaps will ſay, that this is reproach: for ſo <hi>chap. 4. num.</hi> 33. But we doe but argue, and I pray who giues the cauſe? <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque ſcripta ſunt, propter nos ſcripta ſunt.</hi> Rom. 15.</p>
               <p>§ 9. To omit that <hi>Proſper</hi> vpon the ſame Pſalme <hi>(Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper Leo's</hi> ſecretarie, and S. <hi>Auſtens</hi> ſcholler) tunes it yet in a higher key, making <hi>Iudas</hi> not onely beare the perſon of the wicked, which you conſtrue ſo imperiouſly as we haue now heard; but he ſaies in plaine tearmes, <hi>Iudas primatum geſſit inimicorum Chriſti,</hi> Iudas bare the primacie of Chriſts enemies: which I truſt you will not expound, how impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſoeuer, that <hi>Iudas</hi> was made <hi>chiefe</hi> magiſtrate ouer Chriſts enemies: no more then was <hi>Peter</hi> ouer Chriſts friends.</p>

Speaking there of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours repaſt after his reſurrection with fiſh &amp; hony-combe, he ponders the very number of the diſciples then preſent, and thus gathers: <hi>Vt omnes qui hanc ſpem gerimus, per illum ſeptenarium numerum diſcipulorum, per quem poteſt hoc loco no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra vniuerſitas intelligi figurata, tanto ſacramento nos commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicare noſſemus, &amp; eidem beatitudini ſociari.</hi> That is, That all we which are indued with this hope, may know that by that ſeuenfold number of diſciples (by which our whole companie may here ſeeme to be figured) we are both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that myſterie, and fellowes in that bliſſe.

though the Ieſuites haue a proiect, wee heare, to bring in more then one, to manage at one time the Sea Apoſtolick.

Apoſtles, ſhewed he neuer meant, that one ſhould gouern all after they were dead, as theſe now would haue the Pope to doe in Peters ſtead. But as I was ſaying, the 7. figurers here are not 7. gouernours: no more then is Peter figuring the Church, or bearing the figure of the Church, or whatſoeuer elſe ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that way, inueſted in the authoritie that this man here dreames of, as if <hi>gerere figuram,</hi> were <hi>gerere perſonam;</hi> and <hi>gerere perſonam,</hi> were <hi>potiri rerum.</hi>

But S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten</hi> here anſwers it a great deale more roundly; that ſeuen men at another time, and not onely Peter, <hi>figurauerunt vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitatem noſtram,</hi> repreſented our whole companie, the company of the faithfull, that is, the Church of God, whom yet, I ſuppoſe, he will not allow for Popes.</p>

And yet in truth more plainely in this place, which may ſerue, if any thing, to open their eyes, that dare build vpon a man as the foundation of their Church, though it were Peter himſelfe, that I ſay not how vnworthy creatures now in his Roome. <hi>Ideo quippe ait Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus, Super hanc petram aedificabo Eccleſiam meam, quia dixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Petrus, Tu es Christus filius dei viui.

               <p>§ 20. He ſaies then, That as there is a two fold ſtate of the Church, one in miſery and in exile, another in glorie, in royaltie, and in bliſſe; ſo Peter was made a figure of the former, Iohn of the latter, by our Sauiour Chriſt. So as not onely <hi>Iohannes anteponitur Petro,</hi> Iohn in the one of theſe is preferred before Peter, (as S. <hi>Auſtens</hi> words are) but ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Iohn ſurpaſſeth Peter, as much as the life that we ſhall lead in bliſſe, excels this miſerable that here we liue. For thereafter as the liues are, ſo are the figures of them both, which are here ſaid to be theſe two Apoſtles, Peter of the militant Church, Iohn of the triumphaut, as hath beene
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:25255:36"/>
ſhewed. But ſhall wee ſay, trow you, that Iohn is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch in the triumphant, or beares any rule or regiment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the bleſſed, where the Sonne himſelfe reſignes his Kingdome, or ſubmits it at leaſt to God the Father, 1. Cor. 15.? Or if Iohn haue no ſuch monarchie by vertue of his figuring and repreſenting that ſtate, why then ſhould Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter claime any in earth, becauſe he ſtands for a figure of the militant? The words are ſomewhat long, but I will onely ſet downe as many as ſhall ſerue to giue the Reader light, the reſt may be viewed and dwelt on by leaſure. <hi>Duas vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas ſibi diuinitùs praedicatas &amp; commendat as nouit eccleſia: qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum eſt vna in fide, altera in ſpecie: vna in tempore peregrinatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, altera in aeternitate manſionis: vna in labore, altera in requie vna in viâ, altera in patriâ: vna in opere actionis, altera in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede contemplationis: vna declinat à malo &amp; facit bonum, altera nullum habet, à quo declinet, malum, &amp; magnum habet quo fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atur bonum: vna cum hoſte pugnat, altera ſine hoſte regnat: vna fortis eſt in aduerſis, altera nihil ſentit aduerſi: vna carnales li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidines fraenat, altera ſpiritalibus delectationibus vacat: vna eſt vincendi curâ ſollicita, altera victoriae pace ſecura: vna in tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus adiuuatur, altera ſine vllâ tentatione in ipſo adiutore lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur: vna ſubuenit indigenti, altera ibi eſt vbi nullum inuenit indigentem: vna aliena peccata vt ſua ſibi ignoſcantur, ignoſcit, altera nec patitur quod ignoſcat, nec facit quod ſibi poſcat igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſci: vnaflagellatur malis, ne extollatur in bonis, altera tantâ ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudine gratiae caret omni malo, vt ſine vllâ tentatione ſuperbiae cohaereat ſummo bono: vna bona &amp; mala diſcernit, altera quae ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la bona ſunt cernit.

but enioyes a good paſt all expreſſing. One continually copes with her enemies, the other triumphs without any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie: one maintaines courage in the midſt of tribulation, the other is paſt ſenſe of any more trouble: one reſtraines carnall luſts and pleaſures, the other attends delights ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: one is carefull out of the deſire it hath to conquer, the other is at peace &amp; ſecure like a conquereſſe: one finds helpe of God in temptation, the other reioyces in her hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per God, ſcorning the tempter: one releeues the poore with her charitie, the other is there where there is no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie: one forgiues other mens ſinnes, that her owne may be pardoned, the other neither commits what ſhee ſhould wiſh to be forgiuen her, nor ſuffers ought of that which we pardon in another: one is chaſtened with ouils, leaſt ſhee be proud of the good, the other is ſo freed from all kind of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill by the fulneſſe of grace, that ſhee adheres to the cheife good without any danger of pride: one diſcerns the good from the euill, but the other ſees nothing but that which is good. So as the one is good, but as yet in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the other is better and in moſt perfect ioyes. Then followes. <hi>Iſta ſignificata eſt per Apoſtolum Petrum, illa per Iohannem.

This life therefore of ours is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by Iohn, who loued Chriſt leſſe, and therefore waits for his comming, til the other life may be reuealed, and the loue of it perfited as it ſhould be in vs: but the ſame Iohn was more loued of Chriſt, becauſe that [life] makes vs bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which in him was inſtanced; [or, figured.] Then, <hi>Nemo tamen istos inſignes Apostolos ſeparet.</hi> Yet let no man ſeuer theſe two excellent Apoſtles.

And ſo it followes in S. <hi>Auſten, Ibi enim omnes ſenſus apparent.</hi> But ſpeake we to the 30. chapter, which is the thing in queſtion. Intreating there how the Church ought to ſhew compaſſion to her children, conuerting by repentance, he thus ſaies: <hi>Non enim ſine causâ inter omnes A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolos, huius eccleſiae catholicae perſonam ſuſtinet Petrus.</hi> That is, For not without cauſe doth Peter among all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſuſtaine the perſon of this Catholicke Church. <hi>Huic enim eccleſiae Claues regni coelorum datae ſunt:</hi> For to this Church, the keies of the Kingdome of heauen were giuen. Which latter FOR, is not to ſhow that Peter was choſen to beare the perſon of the Church, <hi>non ſine causâ,</hi> not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, as he had ſaid before, but to prooue what hee had ſuppoſed, that Peter did beare the Churches perſon; ſince the keyes are too great a <hi>depoſitum</hi> for Peter, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in his owne name, but in the Churches. And ſo much he had deliuered before vpon the 108. Pſalm. I will not now trouble the Reader to repeat it. Onely this may bee remembred, that there he ſaies, <hi>Tibi dabo claues,</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe ſayings, which howſoeuer <hi>videntur pertinere ad

This there. But now in this place he addes another example, to ſhew that Peter did beare the Churches perſon, and not his owne: As when, <hi>Paſce oues,</hi> is ſaid to him. <hi>Et cum ei dicitur, ad om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes dicitur, Amas me? Paſce oues meas.</hi> Where I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund without ſome paſſion, what can bee ſaid more pregnantly to the <hi>Biſhops</hi> purpoſe, that, <hi>Paſce oues,</hi> was not ſaid to Peter onely, when S. <hi>Auſten</hi> makes it common to all (all of the ranke at leaſt) and vouches it as an inſtance, that Peter did beare the perſon of the Church, and not his own only, in diuers things that paſſed vpon him? Me thinks vpon the alledging but of thus much out of S. <hi>Auſt.</hi> if truly, if in his ſenſe, the queſtion ſhould be at an end. Yet becauſe this man cries out againſt <hi>maimed allegations,</hi> I will keepe promiſe, as I ſaid, to ſet downe ſo much of S. <hi>Auſtens</hi> text, as no man comming after ſhall neede more: and that by the way it may be ſeene, whether this fellow can clip a text or no, for his adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, &amp; leaue out that which is too hoat for him to meddle with; practiſing that impudently at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame time, which he traduces the <hi>Biſhop</hi> for moſt wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Thus then S.

               <p>§ 22. To returne to S. <hi>Auſten,</hi> and to conclude this whole matter with relating his text as largely as you can deſire. The ſumme is, that the Church muſt bee gratious toward her children, conuerting and returning by repentance, as our Sauiour was to Peter, the image of the Church, or the proxie of the Church (for I feare not to vouch that name by him, which hath euery where ſo good grounds in S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten,</hi> as you haue heard) and <hi>bearing her perſon not without cauſe.

That here alſo you may ſee another reaſon, Sir, though you haue beene twice anſwered to this queſtion before, why Peter rather then another figured the Church, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe Peter beeing a great ſinner, and yet after his ſinnes finding greater grace, was ſo much the apter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent her, which in both theſe kinds is verie notorious, both <hi>abundantis peccati,</hi> and <hi>ſuper-abundantis gratiae,</hi> of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing grace after exceeding guiltineſſe, Rom. 5. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours Parable is not vnknowne to this purpoſe, Luk. 7. (propounded to a Simon, though not this Simon) which of the two debters ought more? The caſe was Peters owne, both a great debter, and releaſed of much, and perhaps our Sauiour deliuered it as in his hearing, ſo not without ſome reference to him ſtanding by.

But what is that to controule ſo many aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient editions? Or does it not ſhew, that thoſe words are ſo effectuall againſt your primacie (as your ſelfe at a bluſh confeſſed ere-while, ſaying that S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> neuer meant to bee ſo liberall) that becauſe you could not wreſt them with any forged interpretation, you had rather cut them out then abide the hazard? And yet it is found, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Rome</hi> edition, of which I ſpake euen now, and that of <hi>Paris, ann.</hi> 1603. profeſſing to followe it in euery point, there is an other of <hi>Paris, ann.</hi> 1586. which retaines the ſaid words in ſpight of Rome.

I will ſet downe a little of the ſtorie that hee tells there, and ſo paſſe on to your next argument. When I <note place="margin">The fellonious Edition of S. Ambroſe at Lyons.</note> was at <hi>Lyons,</hi> ſaith he, in the yeare 1559. I was acquainted with a certaine corrector of the Preſſe, whoſe name was <hi>Ludouicus Saurius.</hi> And comming one day to viſit him, I found him by chance, or rather by the ſpeciall prouidence of God, reuiſing S. <hi>Ambroſe's</hi> works, which then <hi>Frelloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was in printing. And after much talke on both ſides, when I had told him I would not hinder his worke, he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding afreſh a page of that worke, Do you ſee (quoth he) the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:25255:47"/>
faſhion of this our edition of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> how neat, how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate, and if you regard the ſight, to bee preferred before all that haue been yet printed? Afterward as I conſidered and applauded the goodnes of it; Well, for all that (quoth he) if I were to buy me a copy of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> I would buy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rather then this that you ſee. And demanding of him the reaſon of his ſo ſaying, he brought out certaine pages out of the decks vnder his table, in which pages there were two rowes one againſt the other, ſuch as they call <hi>cancella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioperis,</hi> and thus added: Looke you (quoth he) this is the firſt forme of our pages, which within theſe few dayes we printed after a copy of verie good credit. But two <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcan</hi> Friers by their authoritie daſhed all this good work, and in place of the firſt ſheets, made vs print theſe that you ſaw euen now, cleane beſides all the direction of our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, with no ſmall hinderance and trouble to <hi>Frellonius,</hi> &amp;c. This reports <hi>Iunius</hi> of his owne experience, touching your corrupting of Saint <hi>Ambroſe;</hi> And ſo much of that point.</p>
               <p>§ 31. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Your other argument is drawne from certaine  places of that Father, which ſeeme contrarie to this, you ſay, and ſo this not to be admitted for his. The firſt is vpon the 12. of the ſecond to the Corinth. <hi>Primatum non accepit Andreas ſed Petrus:</hi> Not Andrew, but Peter, receiued the primacie.

The firſt is <hi>ordinis,</hi> the ſecond <hi>praeſtantiae.</hi> The one of order, the other of eminencie. And the one in one, the other in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teſtimonie of S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> may be conceiued. <hi>Accepit primatum,</hi> you ſay.

the Lord that diuideth <hi>inter flammas ignium,</hi> and much more betweene one brother and another, which comes <hi>ſaliens &amp; tranſiliens,</hi> as it is in the Cant. and of two bedfellowes, of two grinders at the mill, receiues one, refuſes the other, preferd <hi>Peter</hi> before <hi>Andrew</hi> his brother. What is this to the Popedome? what to a Monarchie? what, I ſay not to their ſtately, but euen ſtatarie and ordinarie ſupremacie in the Church?

The wonder then lies here. Andrew that followed firſt (that by the way you may ſee how little ſenioritie preuailes in Gods ſchool, which yet you ſo truſt vnto) receiued not the primacie that Peter did, that is, was none of thoſe three <hi>primi</hi> wherof Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was. Neither ſay ye, that becauſe Peter onely is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned here, onely oppoſed to Andrew, therefore only Peter receiued the primacie in S. <hi>Ambroſes</hi> meaning. For Peter is oppoſed to Andrew, as one brother to another, and the <hi>iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi> to him which is knowne to haue reſorted more carely to Chriſt, which compariſon betweene him and others were not ſo cleare.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:25255:48"/>
belongs to the other place. <hi>Quia ſolus profitetur, ſolus antefertur.</hi> But <hi>anteferri</hi> is one thing, <hi>praeponi</hi> another. The latter may be of authoritie, the firſt of any excellencie. Doe I ſeeme once againe too grammaticall to you? To you perhaps: but how doe you gainſay me? <hi>Anteferri,</hi> I ſay, is one thing, as to be eſteemed before another, to be graced before another, like <hi>anteire, antecellere,</hi> and if you haue any more like. For it was not no grace for S. Peter here, to be bid to feede, as a common man, an vniuerſall man, as one in whoſe perſon the others were exhorted, and as S. <hi>Auſten</hi> ſaies, the Church repreſented. Thus, <hi>quia ſolus profitetur ex omnibus, omnibus antefertur.</hi> And laſtly, <hi>martyrij corona decer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitur,</hi> as S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> here ſaies, he is promiſed martyrdome in thoſe words, <hi>Cum ſenueris &amp;c.</hi> which is no ſmall glorie. In which place alſo by the way, you may ſee the libertie of Eccleſiaſticall men, that you ſo ſtand vpon. When Peter was yong, that is, before he was Apoſtle, he might go whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Ioh. 11.</note> he would. Afterward he was to follow againſt his will. Is this exemption? But becauſe you conferre place with place, to perſwade vs that we conſtrue S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> amiſſe, I hope you will giue vs the like leaue hereafter, to conferre diuerſe places of the Fathers with themſelues, before wee aſſent to that which you produce out of them. And yet it followes in S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> after, <hi>omnibus antefertur,</hi> as it were by way of reaſon, <hi>Maior enim omnibus charitas eſt:</hi> for charity is greater then all. So as Peters <hi>anteferri,</hi> is neither groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon his priuiledge of retaining the faith, as you would make it, of his loue rather, which you confeſſe often to haue failed in your Popes, (as if the after-name <hi>Peter</hi> had aboliſhed <hi>Simon, qui interpretatur obediens,</hi> as <hi>Beda</hi> notes) and the prioritie, if he had any aſſigned him ouer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <note place="margin">Serm.

From both which the Leuites beeing exempt by calling, what maruell if with the reſt they are not to bee leuied?

of treaſon, as if hee could not looſe his office by cenſure from our Sauiour, but ſubiects may lay down their fealtie to Magiſtrates, when they fall into offence. Or, doe you thinke that no <hi>Apoſtle</hi> could looſe his place? If you do, you may read S. <hi>Hierome ad Ruſticum,</hi> affirming of <hi>Iudas,</hi> that he fell <hi>de faſtigio Apoſtolatûs,</hi> &amp;c. to a place vnrecouerable. Wherein our Sauiour dealt more mildly with <hi>Peter,</hi> whom he tooke in againe. <hi>Curans verbis, quod verbis offenſum erat,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Cyrill:</hi> healing with words, his fault of words, that is, triple <hi>negation</hi> by proportionable <hi>confeſſion.</hi> And remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you not what the holy Ghoſt ſaith of <hi>Iudas, Epiſcopatum cius accipiat alter?</hi> which was not practiſed againſt S. <hi>Peter,</hi> our Lord dealing graciouſly with him, as I ſaid, as if he had ſuſpended him, not depriued him. But for my part, I take not vpon me to define this queſtion; and the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> as moſt able, ſo I dare ſay was farther of from medling with it. He lookes not to by-matters, but when <hi>dignus vindice nodus</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it ſelfe, then he lendes a hand; whereas you patch, and pelt, and clowt euery thing into euery place that you can, like a beggers coate, or a <hi>Sturbridge-faire</hi> booth, or a cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe tree in the midſt of the ſea. The <hi>Biſhops</hi> purpoſe was onely to ſignifie in S. <hi>Cyrils</hi> words, that <hi>dignitas Apoſtola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tûs renouata eſt S. Petro,</hi> that the honour of the <hi>Apoſtleſhip</hi> was renewed to S. <hi>Peter. Fatemur</hi> (ſaies he) as aſſenting to S. <hi>Cyrill,</hi> not iangling nor determining, as you would haue it. And I pray Sir, how does that differ from S. <hi>Cyrils</hi> own words, which you traduce in the <hi>Biſhop, ne propter negationem labefactata videretur? Concuſſa</hi> therefore it was, ſhaken and enfeebled, but not vtterly daſht nor vndermin'd. And where you prattle not a little, a little before, <hi>But perhaps ſome will ſay, that the Biſhop does not plainely affirme this, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth the doctrine of S. Auſten and S. Cyrill,</hi> which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe by thoſe words, that you bring out of the <hi>Biſhop, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutus muneri,</hi> reſtored to his charge, as if therefore he had loſt it in the <hi>Biſhops</hi> opinion: what more is in <hi>reſtitution,</hi> then was afore in <hi>renouation?</hi> And if the <hi>Apoſtleſhip</hi> be <hi>renouatus,</hi>

how is not the <hi>Apoſtle reſtitutus?</hi> If S. <hi>Cyrill</hi> be right, how is the <hi>Biſhop</hi> wrong? May I not truely aske, what does this dog lacke but a bone?

and of all the Apoſtles, and of all the Fathers of the Church.</hi> Here is nothing for your turne, ſaue that <hi>Peter</hi> was choſen to haue the <hi>charge of the Apoſtles.</hi> But to the calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> though all helped, yet none might compare with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> for that matter, who therefore calls himſelfe the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of the Gentiles:</hi> and leaſt you thinke he gloſes, <gap reason="foreign">

I haue thought good, firſt of all to ſet it downe, as it lies in our bookes. <hi>In all points following the Decrees of the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and admitting the Canon lately read, of the 150 moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Biſhops, aſſembled together vnder the great Emperour Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius, of pious memorie, in the Imperiall Conſtantinople, new Rome, we alſo decree and determine the ſame things, concerning the priuiledges of the moſt holy Church of Conſtantinople afore-ſaid, the new Rome. For iuſtly did the Fathers giue priuiledges to the throne of old Rome, becauſe that Citie was then regent. And the 150 moſt bleſſed Biſhops, mooued with the ſame conſideration, gaue equall priuiledges to the moſt holy throne of new Rome: wiſely iudging it meete and reaſonable, that the Citie which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed both Empire and Senate, and was endued with the like pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges (or equall priuiledges) that old Rome was, ſhould in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Eccleſiaſticall be aduanced and magnified, euen as ſhee</hi> (or <hi>no leſſe then ſhee) beeing ſecond after her,</hi> (not <hi>ſubiect to her,</hi> but, <hi>ſecond after her:</hi> yet F.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> For as in the one, ſo in the others, let it be, ſay the Fathers.

               <p>§ 4. And by this we anſwer to his other wiſe obiection, that if preheminence of order bee reſerued to <hi>Rome,</hi> how then does the <hi>Canon</hi> make them equall in all things? In all things elſe, this onely excepted, which the <hi>Canon</hi> excepts, and nothing elſe, to ſhew, that as for other things, they are to be equalled in all.</p>

               <p>§ 6. As for the printing of thoſe words, <hi>in all things,</hi> in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent letter, which according to the meaſure of your accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed franknes, you call <hi>corrupt and fraudulent dealing,</hi> how often ſhal we tell you, that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> followed the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the letter, as diuerſe others haue done, and daily doe, to ſpecifie the thing it ſelfe intended by the <hi>Canon,</hi> and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print it the deeper in the Readers mind, not as alleadging the letter of it, and ſo <hi>counterfeiting,</hi> as you pleaſe to call it. From which in truth he was ſo farre, that you make it his fault in this very <hi>Chapter, num.</hi> 3. not to offer to lay it down, or the words of it, but onely to argue, and to drawe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences therefrom, as his occaſion ſerued.</p>
               <p>§ 7. Now whereas you would explicate the <hi>Canons</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

And yet laſtly, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> deſcribing the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence <note place="margin">Can. 6.</note> of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as a <hi>patterne of Patriarchſhip,</hi> vtters it in thoſe words of <hi>Ruffinus</hi> tranſlation, <hi>quòd Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum ſuburbicariarum curam habeat,</hi> that he hath care of the Churches that are abutting vpon the citie; to which <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> ſpreading ſo the iuriſdiction of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> this <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> may ſeeme to allude, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning ſo many Churches as you here recite, and all of them ſubiect to the <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>

Paſchaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus and Lucentius ſaid, Yeſterday after your Highnes were riſen, and we followed your ſteps, there were certaine things decreed as we heare, which we thinke were done beſides the order and Canons of the Church. We beſeech you therefore that your excellencies would command the ſame to be read againe, that the whole compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny may ſee whether it were rightly or diſorderly done. The moſt glorious Iudge anſwered, If any thing were decreed after our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partures, let it be read againe. And before the reading, Aetius Archdeacon of Conſtantinople</hi> (after a few other words pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed) <hi>ſaid thus. We had ſomewhat to doe for the Church of Conſtantinople. We prayed the Biſhops that came from Rome, that they would</hi> [ſtay and] <hi>communicate with vs. They refuſed, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we may not, we are otherwiſe charged. We acquainted your Honours with it, and you willed that this holy Councell ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it. Your highnes then departing, the Biſhops that are here, conferring of a common cauſe, required this to be done. And here they are. It was not done in ſecret, nor by ſtealth, but order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and lawfully.</hi> This for the <hi>Firſt.</hi>

               <p>§ 24. Heare alſo for the <hi>ſecond,</hi> what we read in the ſame <hi>Action. Lucentius reuerend Biſhop, and Vicegerent of the Sea Apoſtolick, ſaid: Firſt, let your Highnes conſider, how guilefully the Biſhops were dealt with, and how haſtily the matter was handled,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:25255:81"/>
that they ſhould be conſtrained to ſubſcribe, contrary to the holy Canons.</hi> And <hi>Beronicianus, moſt relligious Secretarie of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Conſiſtorie, interpreting the former ſaying, the Reuerend Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops cryed out, None of vs was conſtrained.</hi> And after many things between, againe we read: <hi>The moſt glorious Iudges ſaid:</hi> Theſe, <hi>the moſt holy Biſhops of Aſia, and Pontus, that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the book, as it was read vnto them, let them ſay whether they ſubſcribed of their owne accord, and with full conſent, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by ſome neceſſitie laid vpon them. And the aforeſaid Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of Aſia, and Pontus, that had ſubſcribed, comming foorth into the midſt, Diogenes reuerend Biſhop Cyzici, ſaid, Before God I ſubſcribed willingly. Florentius reuerend Biſhop Sardeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lydiae, ſaid, No neceſſitie was laid vpon me, but I ſubſcribed of mine own accord. Romanus reuerend Biſhop Myrorum, ſaid, I was not conſtrained: It ſeemes iuſt to me, and I ſubſcribed willingly. Calogerus reuerend Biſhop Claudiopolis Honoriadis, ſaid, I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed with my will, not conſtrained, and according to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the hundred and fiftie holy Fathers</hi> [in the firſt Councell of Conſtantinople.] <hi>Seleucus Biſhop of Amaſia, ſaid, I did it by mine owne will, deſirous to be vnder this Sea (of Conſtantinople,) becauſe to me it ſeemes good wiſedome. Eleuthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Biſhop of Chalcedon, ſaid, I ſubſcribed by my will, knowing that both by the Canons, and by cuſtome aforegoing, the Sea of Conſtantinople hath theſe priuiledges.</hi> Where, by the way, you may ſee how fond the obiection is, that <hi>Lucentius</hi> then made, and ſome ſince him, that the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was neuer put in vſe, whereas the <hi>Biſhop of the place here,</hi> where the <hi>Councell</hi> was held, alleadges both <hi>Canon</hi> and <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> for it. <hi>Nunechius reuerend Biſhop of Laodicea of Phrygia, I ſubſcribed of mine owne accord. Marinianus, Pergamius, Critonianus, Euſebius, Antiochus,</hi> with diuerſe more, too long to be reckoned, <hi>profeſſed in the ſame ſort, Sponte ſubſcripſimus, we ſubſcribed willingly, on of our owne accord.</hi> What can the <hi>Adioyndrer</hi> reply to this? And yet afterward more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if it may be, <hi>When the glorious Iudges had ſo pronounced, Oportere ſanctiſſimum Archiepiſcopum regiae Conſtantinopolis

               <p>§ 25. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> His third reaſon is, <hi>becauſe the other Canon</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> vpon which this was grounded, was neuer put  in practiſe till that time.

                  </gap>, vnleſſe you will teach the Fathers how to ſpeake.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the conſtruction muſt be thus, by your grand Logick, <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers gaue not all priuiledges to Rome, for the ſeat Imperiall, but the priuiledges giuen thereto, in respect of the Imperiall ſeat, were giuen thereto in respect of the Imperiall ſeat, and none others.</hi> Is not this ſweete art now, and worthie of a Ieſuit?</p>
               <p>§ 35. The reaſons that you bring, why the Councell ſhould not mention the prerogatiue of <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe it would hinder <hi>Anatolius</hi> his cauſe, and the preferment of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which was then intended, doe they not ſhew, that either the Fathers were damnably partiall, to obſcure the true cauſe of Romes aduancement, or elſe that <hi>Peter</hi> was no cauſe thereof at all? For ſay not, it helped not to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:25255:85"/>
the cauſe in hand. The Fathers were not ſo blind, as not to ſee it; much leſſe ſo groſſe, as ſeeing to ſmother it, or for deſire to winne their cauſe, to tranſlate it cleane another way. And ſuppoſe they would haue done ſo, why did no bodie <hi>contradict</hi> them, as you ſaid a little before, about the titles of Supplications? When there were negatiues in the Councell, <hi>qui non ſubſcripſerunt,</hi> as we read in the 16. <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> why did no bodie lay forth the lameneſſe of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and drawe <hi>Peter</hi> from vnder the ſtuffe? Once againe, me thinkes, an Angel ſhould haue ſmote him on the ſide, and bid him ſtand vp now if euer. For the Fathers had bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his prerogatiue cleane, and entitled the dignitie of Rome to the Empire, as if the Empire authoriſed the Church, not the Church the Empire. No reply was made, none found fault with the reaſon. Therefore wee take you at your word, <hi>num. 67. That the mention of Peters primacie, does not onely not helpe, but euen croſſe this Canon.</hi> If the <hi>Canon</hi> then be good, <hi>Peters</hi> primacie is none.</p>
               <p>§ 36. That <hi>Leo excommunicated Dioſcorus by the Synode,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraines his power of excommunicating Patriarchs, rather then eſtabliſhes it.

ſhall be this, remembring my promiſe to obſerue bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity, from which I am but too eaſily blowne awry, with the ſtorme of your fopperies.</p>
               <p>You make it an argument of <hi>Leos ſupremacie,</hi> (you call it <hi>Monarchie</hi> very roundly a little after, and are not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at it, <hi>chap. 4. num.</hi> 3.) that, <hi>firſt Leo was admitted Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Councell held in Greece:</hi> then, <hi>that Leo beeing abſent, Anatolius kept not his place, but Legates of his owne ſending, whereof one was a Prieſt.</hi> The anſwer is moſt eaſie. <hi>Leo</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing denied one part of his will, to haue the Councell in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> it was a poore recompence (I meane for his <hi>monarchie,</hi> and in regard to that) to be employed to be their <hi>Preſident,</hi> as a wiſe man, a learned man, and a ſtout man, likewiſe alſo in order ſurmounting them all, as hath beene acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, whereas diuerſe <hi>Preſidents</hi> had beene in Councels, that were inferiour to <hi>Leo</hi> in theſe points, and therefore much more remooued from the ſtately <hi>Monarchy,</hi> that you from hence gather.</p>
               <p>§ 39. But, <hi>Why not Anatolius?</hi> ſay you. <hi>Was not hee fit to be Preſident, whome the Councell thought fit to be ſo aduanced in their Canon, as to haue the like ſtroke in Eccleſiaſticall affaires, that the verie firſt of the ranke had?</hi> Once againe I muſt tell you belike, that the Canon aduances not <hi>Anatolius,</hi> but <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> And it was the parting of ſtakes betweene <hi>Leo</hi> and him, that though the <hi>Councell</hi> were in <hi>Greece,</hi> yet <hi>Leo</hi> ſhould be the <hi>Preſident.</hi> As for his Legates, it was no matter, (after once they had concurred vpon <hi>Leo</hi> to bee the man) whome he ſent in his place, ſo long as they were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, ſince himſelfe could not be there. And I hope they brought inſtructions From <hi>Leo,</hi> as themſelues ſay often, and might haue reference to him, if any doubt ſhould ariſe. Alſo it was the fitter, that Italian Biſhops ſhould be Preſidents, and not Grecian, that the Canon might be the authentical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, which was enacted for <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as farther from partialitie of the lawmakers. To which purpoſe they ſay, in their Epiſtle to <hi>Leo,</hi> (the Fathers of that Councell) that

the Emperours affecting the exaltation of Conſtantinople, <hi>Volebant celebrari &amp; ab vniuerſali Concilio,</hi> for more authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſake no doubt, and ſo likewiſe by forraine Biſhops, as <hi>Leo</hi> and his Legates. But if you thinke his Legates had any ſuch ſtroke, that <hi>Anatolius</hi> ſhould enuy them for their greatneſſe, you may remember, how boldly the <hi>Councell</hi> diſſented from them, and the <hi>Canon</hi> was confirmed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their demurres.</p>

of <hi>authority,</hi> and much more of <hi>ſupremacie,</hi> but moſt of all of the <hi>monarchy,</hi> that the Ieſuites would crowne <hi>Peter</hi> with, by vertue of this place. And when the ſame <hi>Cyprian,</hi> a very few lines afore the words laſt alleaged, makes this to be the cauſe of abuſes in the Church, <hi>quòd ad veritatis originem non reditur, nec caput quaeritur, nec magiſtricoele ſtis doctrina ſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> what is plainer, then that by <hi>caput</hi> (which they ſo catch at) he meanes nothing elſe but the originall verity, which our Sauiour Chriſt firſt deliuered, euen that ſame <hi>Sic ab i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitio,</hi> as both <hi>origo veritatis, &amp; doctrina coeleſtis magiſtri</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, which encompaſſe the word <hi>Caput</hi> like two torches of both ſides of it, to giue light vnto it, that we miſtake it not.

               <p>§ 5. I might likewiſe aske you what manner of primacy you call that, which excuſes not the ſuperiour from the iuſt and lawfull rebuke of his inferiour, but ſo as <hi>if</hi> S. <hi>Peter ſhould haue refuſed to follow, and to obey</hi> S. <hi>Paul,</hi> (they are your owne words, num. 16.) <hi>he ſhould haue done inſolently.</hi> Call you that a primacy, ſpecially a Popiſh one, which muſt be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of controule, liable to the obedience, euen of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derling, if it will avoyd pride?</p>

               <p>§ 7.

Yet you ſeeme to your ſelfe wiſe, when you ſhew the <hi>Biſhop</hi> as well many heads vpon one body, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny foundations of one building. <hi>Videlicet,</hi> ſay you, <hi>the ſtates of Venice, ſo many ſtates, ſo many heads of that commonwealth.</hi> Which firſt is harſh in Ariſtocraty, to make euery gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour a ſeuerall head (more then the <hi>Amphiſbaena</hi> hath) the whole company rather, and many men if you will, but one head. Yet this fonder, that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> arguing from a <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall</hi> houſe, not a <hi>metaphoricall,</hi> and from a <hi>naturall</hi> bodie not a <hi>proportionall,</hi> to demonſtrate what is meet to bee expected in the <hi>myſticall,</hi> you ſhew him a <hi>politicall,</hi> which is nothing to his demand.</p>
               <p>§ 8. NExt of S. <hi>Hierome.</hi> And why might not the <hi>Biſhop</hi> taxe the Cardinall, for ſuppreſſing S. <hi>Hieromes</hi> words, as well as before S. <hi>Cyprians? As well</hi> (ſay you) <hi>the one as the other, that is iuſt neither, or neither iuſtly.</hi> But of <hi>Cyprian</hi> we haue ſeene, ſee we now of <hi>Hierome. Inter duodecim vnus eligitur, vt capite conſtituto, ſchiſmatis tolleretur occaſio.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt twelue, one is choſen, that a Head beeing appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, occaſion of ſchiſme might be taken away. <hi>lib. 1. in Iovin.</hi> But in the ſame booke (ſaies the <hi>Biſhop) Hierome</hi> thus, which the Cardinall would take no notice of. <hi>But thou wilt ſay, that the Church is built vpon Peter. (What then?) though the ſame in another place be done vpon all, [that is, the Church is ſaid to be built vpon all the Apoſtles,] and all to receiue the Keyes of the kingdome of heauen, and the ſtrength of the Church to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually grounded vpon them all. Yet indeede one is choſen among the twelue, that a Head beeing appointed, occaſion of ſchiſme might be cut off.</hi> Is this no cooling card to the other autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie? For you that tell vs of dice, I may doe well to ſpeake to you in a ſutable metaphore, and not abhorring from your trade. As the Philoſophers ſay, the braine in a mans bodie, tempers the heat of the heart beneath; ſo doe not the words precedent allay the force of theſe latter, which
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:25255:92"/>
yet the Cardinall onely ſet before vs? For the threefold equalitie, which S. <hi>Hierome</hi> before aſcribed to all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>one</hi> of their equall intereſt in the foundation, <hi>another</hi> in the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, and the <hi>third,</hi> which is reiterated for deeper impreſſion, of bearing the whole ſtrength, or ſtreſſe of the Church, leaues onely now this ſenſe of <hi>caput,</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> was choſen to haue ſuch a kind of Headſhip, that is, of prioritie among the twelue, as ſhould not derogate from paritie, and yet exclude ſchiſme or gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyle, or confuſion. Which is the primacie of order that we haue often told you of, and you would faine diuert to a primacie of Maieſtie. I could not anſwer your fallacie in a directer faſhion, yet I know you haue replies, as that <hi>caput</hi> in the laſt place, addes great force, to, <hi>ſuper quem fundata eſt,</hi> in the firſt. Which we remit to the iudgement of the indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Reader, whether ſo many equalities yeelded to the Apoſtles, in the words afore, doe not rather force vs, to conſtrue <hi>caput</hi> as hath beene ſayd, not derogating from the equality of their power in the keyes, nor from bearing the groundworke of the Church ioyntly: that is, as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue it, from beeing gouernours thereof. Beſides that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put</hi> is onely a borrowed word, and ſignifies <hi>primum,</hi> or the firſt in that kinde, (which we grant to <hi>Peter</hi> with all readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) and laſtly tempered with ſuch a modeſt clauſe, <hi>to keepe out ſchiſme or diſorder</hi> onely.</p>
               <p>§ 9. You ſay, <hi>there is more daunger of ſchiſme nowe, then among the twelue.</hi> For they were confirmed by ſpeciall grace, we not ſo. And therefore they were not ſo likely to runne into ſchiſme, for which they ſhould haue a head. As though <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were not running into a <note place="margin">Act. 15. 39.</note> ſchiſme, a paroxyſme at leaſt, that is the firſt grudging of the other ague; as though when <hi>Peter</hi> confirmed his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>&amp; tu confirma,</hi> Luk. 22. 32. they had the leſſe vſe of him, as their head, againſt a ſchiſme. And though the will of God be to <hi>confirme</hi> ſome here, yet not without meanes, neither at firſt to rectifie them, nor afterward to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:25255:92"/>
continue them in their good courſe, to the ende. Of which meanes this might be one, of which S. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſpeakes. Was any man more confirmed then S. <hi>Paul?</hi> rapt into the third heauen, &amp;c. yet he ſtruggles with his nature, leaſt preaching to others, he ſhould be a reprobate himſelfe. So here. Beſides that this ſchiſme, which our Sauiour preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by appointing an Head, as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaies, might be <hi>ſchiſma populorum,</hi> not <hi>Apoſtolorum,</hi> and therefore he ſaies, <hi>vt occaſio ſchiſmat is tolleretur;</hi> that the Chriſtian people ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who was eminent in the Colledge of the Apoſtles, might not euery one raſhly ſet vp their principall, and ſo fall into ſchiſme.</p>
               <p>§ 10. <hi>But at leaſt we neede a Head now a daies, as much as they.</hi> As if we haue not our Head in our manifold regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Dedit quoſdam paſtores,</hi> Eph. 4. <hi>&amp;, Obedite praepoſitis.</hi> Hebr. 13. <hi>&amp;, Terribilis ſicut caſtrorum acies ordinata,</hi> and ſo forth.

               <p>§ 19. Here you tell vs of three waies, by which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles might be ſaide to be <hi>foundations</hi> of the Church, in hope that <hi>Peter</hi> may be ſo in ſingular.

Yet you quote proofes, Rom. 15. <hi>I haue preached the Gospell where Chriſt was not named, leaſt I ſhould build vpon another mans foundation.</hi> Does this prooue that men are foundations of the Church? or rather, that the man and the foundation are two?

And not onely <hi>Peter</hi> is not deſigned to be <hi>he,</hi> but no one Prince magnified before an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, though we ſhould graunt the ſingularitie to be his, if anies. And ſhall all the Apoſtles now haue their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors? ſhall all their authorities be conueied to after-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers? I had thought <hi>Peters</hi> onely had beene permanent. Yet here, of all, <hi>Pro patribus tuis naſcentur filij;</hi> euery Apoſtle hath his ſonne, his ſucceſſor, and euery ones ſonne is made a Prince throughout all the world.

great deale lower, though you are clean beſides the cuſhion there too. For whereas you granted before, that the Canon forbad the appeales of Deacons, though not of Biſhops; now you bring vs an inſtance of two Deacons appealing, <note place="margin">Feliciſſimus <hi>&amp;</hi> Vincentius.</note> ſo as the Canon is trampled downe by your owne confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet the <hi>Biſhops</hi> allegation was of the Canon onely.

And in one word, when <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſo orders the matter vpon theſe fellowes complaints, that he refers the hearing to an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Biſhops, with the primate of the Prouince, as you alleadge, either <hi>Victor,</hi> or <hi>Columbus,</hi> or whome you will, he ſhewes no authority, but onely does as the Canons had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be done, whether he would or no.

               <p>§ 25. It is a wonder, how you dare mention the name of <hi>Flauianus,</hi> who by the Emperors fauour kept his ſeat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">Theod. l. 5. c. 23.</note> ſo many Popes one after another, ſtriuing to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe him, and all in vaine. The paines that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Theophilus</hi> tooke, to make a peace betweene him and <hi>Damaſus,</hi> ſhewed their good care of the Churches vnity, and worthily entitles them to the bleſſing of peacemakers. But that which you call pardoning <hi>Flauianus</hi> offence, and reſtoring him to the communion of the Church againe, was no more then was vſuall in thoſe dayes, between Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and Biſhop, if they miſliked one another, to forbeare communicating mutually; if ſatisfaction were giuen, to returne to fellowſhip and communion againe, which you perhaps, to amplifie the Popes power, would haue vs think to be <hi>excommunication</hi> and <hi>abſolution.</hi> Where you ſay, <hi>that the people of Antioch, were</hi> IN TIME REDVCED <hi>to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and vnitie, with Flavianus their Biſhop, through this act of Damaſus,</hi> it ſhewes it was rather the relenting of their
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:25255:120"/>
mindes, and appeaſing their ſtomacks, out of <hi>Flavianus</hi> good demeanure, and other ſuch conſiderations, then the Popes ſentence, or bare definition. For then what neede long time to worke it? Neither was that a ſigne of <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> his ſupremacie, that <hi>Flavianus</hi> ſent his embaſſage to Rome. For when two are to meete, why ſhould not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour come to the ſuperiour, rather then otherwiſe? I meane inferiour in order, as <hi>Flavianus</hi> here to <hi>Damaſus, Antioch</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> but not in authoritie. Though the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage was not intended ſo much to <hi>Damaſus,</hi> as to cleere the ſcandall that went of <hi>Flavian,</hi> and to ſatisfie the whole Church of God in thoſe parts, that Eaſt and Weſt might no longer continue in iealouſie and alienation.</p>
               <p>§ 26. <hi>And now to come to his ſucceſſor Syricius,</hi> as your owne words are, how doe you prooue his vniuerſall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction? I know it wrings you to be held to this point, but there is no remedy, to that you muſt ſpeake. Forſooth <hi>the Councell of Capua, committed the hearing of Flauianus his cauſe to the Biſhop of Alexandria and the Biſhop of Egypt, with this limitation, as S. Ambroſe witneſſes</hi> (I report your owne words) <hi>that the approbation and confirmation of their ſentence ſhould be reſerued to the Roman ſea, and the Biſhop thereof, who was then Syricius.</hi> Suppoſe this were ſo, how farre is it from arguing vniuerſall iuriſdiction? For as the Councell might make choice of the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the Biſhops of Egypt, to take the firſt knowledge of <hi>Flavianus</hi> his cauſe into their hands, ſo, out of the ſame authoritie, might it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the after iudgement, and the vp ſhot of all, to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome: it might doe this, I ſay, out of it owne liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and for the perſonall worth of <hi>Syricius</hi> Pope, not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prerogatiue of his Sea. And rather it ſhewes the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence of the Councell, that might depute the Pope to ſuch a buſines, as likewiſe the Biſhop of Alexandria and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt. The <hi>Euſebians</hi> made an offer (witnes <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his Apologie) to <hi>Iulius</hi> Pope of Rome, to be their iudge, if he thought good; <hi>Iulio ſi vellet arbitrium cauſae detulerunt.</hi> But
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:25255:120"/>
if <hi>Iulius</hi> had no other hold, it was a poore ſupremacie that might content him. Yet <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> in the Epiſtle 78. which you quote, ſaies not ſo much.

Where the name of the Lord is, there all things are proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.

This alſo may bee the Apoſtles meaning here, that we ſhould ſay and doe all in the name of God, as hath been ſhewed, or in affiance towards God, not bringing the Angels. Doeſt thou eate? thanke God both afore thou eate, and afterward. Doeſt thou ſleepe? Thanke God both afore thou ſleepe, and afterward. Doeſt thou goe to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place?

That is, either praying, or doing any thing elſe. Hearken how Abraham diſmiſſed his ſeruant, in the name of God; how in the name God Dauid ouercame Goliah. Maruellous is his name, and very great.

               <p>§ 19. I haue omitted one thing in the 17. Numb. that <hi>the Saints offer vp our prayers vnto God,</hi> Apoc. 5. for ſo you quote.

The 24 Elders are ſaid to haue <hi>harpes,</hi> that is, the inſtruments of <hi>praiſe,</hi> and <hi>vialls full of ſweete odors,</hi> which the holy Ghoſt expounds, to be the <hi>prayers of the Saints.</hi> But their owne as well as others, for ought I know.

For by a <hi>ſcheme</hi> of ſpeach, they are made to be caſters on of the perfume, though it be Chriſt alone that can diſpence his owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and the Angels are ſtrangers to them. As when it is ſaid in <hi>Mulachie,</hi> that a booke of remembrance was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before the Lord, another is made to ſupply his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as it were, though his ſingular ſufficiency need no ſuch helpe. Laſtly, if we ſhould read, as we no where read, that the Angels offered vp our praiers to God, or carried them to God, I would ſay that their carrying or offering them to God, were nought els but their vnderſtanding his gracious will and pleaſure, for the graunting of our praiers comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The like I read in <hi>Maffaeus</hi> his life of <hi>Ignatius</hi> the Ieſuite-maker, <hi>lib. 2. c. 5. that God the Father commended the Ieſuites to his Sonne,</hi> whom the Scripture ſpeakes of as our commender to the Father, and no otherwiſe.

               </p>
               <p>§ 39. But leaſt you thinke, you can wreſt that club of S. <hi>Auſten, contra Epiſt. Parmen.</hi> before quoted, out of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> hands, <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt is hee alone, <hi>pro quo nemo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellat, ſed ipſe pro omnibus,</hi> for whome no bodie makes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, but he for all; you may pleaſe to conſider, that if this be ſo, then muſt the Angels of force giue ouer beeing Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatours. For if they mediate at all, they muſt mediate for all, and none for them, which, S. <hi>Auſten</hi> ſaith, is proper to Chriſt. <hi>None for them,</hi> becauſe they are in no want, as other folkes are, <hi>all teares beeing wiped from their eyes,</hi> or rather ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any teare hauing bedewed their cheekes. Againe, <hi>they for all;</hi> becauſe burning with charitie, they neglect none, but compaſſionate the cauſe of all them that are in diſtreſſe. And from hence it will follow, that either Chriſt muſt needes giue ouer this ſpecialtie, which S. <hi>Auſten</hi> inueſts him with, or the Angels their mediation. Doe you ſee now, how fitly the <hi>Biſhop</hi> vrgeth this place againſt you, and how you haue inuerted that of <hi>Daniel,</hi> in ſtead of <hi>millia millium miniſtrabant ei,</hi> ſetting vp ſo many Angels, <hi>qui depraedentur eum,</hi> to ſupplant God, and robbe him of his honour?</p>

§ 40. But let vs heare you out of <hi>Daniel,</hi> what you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge for your ſelfe. Num. 57. out of Dan. 3. that <hi>militant Chriſtians fare the better, for the prayers of the Saints in glorie,</hi> becauſe <hi>Daniel</hi> belike vrgeth God, with his promiſe, to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, and Iſaac, &amp;c. This I finde not in the 3. of <hi>Dan.</hi> and the queſtion is not, whether Saints benefit vs, or no, but whether we may pray to them. In this place <hi>Daniel</hi> onely mentions them to God, but makes no petition to them himſelfe. Yet becauſe it is a phraſe that occurres in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and may ſtumble the heedeleſſe, I anſwer briefly. For <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſake, that is, not for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the men, as you conſtrue it, whereas they neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated by their owne merits, much leſſe others by theirs: (ſee Dan. 9. 8.) but for the tenure of Gods promiſe, running vpon <hi>Abraham,</hi> vpon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and their ſeede. So our Sauiour in S. <hi>Iohn, Adhuc nihil rogâſtis in nomine meo; As yet you haue asked nothing in my name. In my name,</hi> that is, in expreſſe knowledge of me, ſince I was reuealed to the world. For, <hi>Deus Abraham, &amp; Iſaac,</hi> was then all in all. Henceforth we pray, <hi>per Chriſtum Dominum,</hi> or <hi>per Chriſtum filium,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our ſuit in that forme of ſtyle. As was propheſied long before, Pſal. 60. 16. <hi>Adorabunt per eum, they ſhall worſhip by him,</hi> or <hi>pray by him,</hi> which then was not performed, now is. Howbeit <hi>Origen</hi> not amiſſe, puts them both together, <hi>hom. 7. in Ezech.</hi> vpon thoſe words, <hi>Incenſum meum poſuiſtis ante faciem eorum,</hi> that is, <hi>idolorum;</hi> and, <hi>incenſum,</hi> ſaies he, is <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationes ſanctorum,</hi> out of the <hi>Apocal.

Though now the former of theſe two, reſolues into the latter; the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> into the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, in whome alone we muſt put our truſt, concerning the graunting of our praiers. Your ſelues doe not much mention <hi>Abraham</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Saints, nor <hi>Iſaac,</hi> nor <hi>Iacob,</hi> which ſhewes their names were not put for <hi>meritorious,</hi> but onely <hi>formall,</hi> or <hi>legall,</hi> as vpon whom went the promiſe, which now in Chriſt alone is <hi>yea and amen,</hi> that is, perfectly perfect.</p>

               <p>§ 43. In your 59. Num. you bewray your ſelfe. <hi>The ability of Saints to help men</hi> (ſay you) <hi>is to be aſcribed not onely to the effect of their prayers, but alſo to their power, authority, and dignity.</hi> You fly then to the Saints, as to the giuers of thoſe things (out of their <hi>power</hi> and <hi>authority)</hi> which you aske in prayer, not onely as ſuters to God for them in your behalfe.

Who doubts but his MAIESTIE reuerences the Fathers, both for infinite good that may be gotten by the reading of them, and namely towards the diſcerning of the truth of points, euen now controuerted in relligion, though ſtill with ſubmiſſion of his iudgement to holy Scripture, and alſo reuerenceth them more by much then the Ieſuits doe, though the Ieſuits happily reuerence more fathers then he? For what <hi>pedaneous author</hi> haue not they made a father of? Ye may ſay with him, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering their falſifications in this kinde, <hi>Mutauit calceos, pater conſcriptus repentè factus eſt.</hi>

And if the Fathers, as you ſay, write ſo few in an age, does not this ſhew that the ſquare of our faith is the Scripture, not the Fathers? for how if the Fathers had wrote nothing at all? As, of diuerſe points, you confeſſe your ſelfe, they did not, Num. 63. and, Num. 66. And in the beginning of this Chapter, you would make vs beleeue, that the Apoſtles themſelues had no commaundement for writing. Might not the Fathers pennes much more haue ſtood ſtill? Yet you adde that the after-ages abounded with writers, when perſecution ceaſed, and many worthy Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes were ſpread abroad into the world.

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:25255:204"/>
which the Tyrant affoarded him. Laſtly, his reaſon is, that the King called him <hi>Beltazzar,</hi> which was the name of his God. Therefore it is likely he honoured him as God.

teſtaments onely at a bluſh, or paſſing by, as you would ſay, but daily they ſtaid vpon them, and were exerciſed in them, &amp;c. This is with <hi>Anſelme</hi> to be no <hi>ſtranger to God,</hi> but <hi>one of his houſhold, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas that vnconſcionable Cardinall of yours, in his Controuerſie about this matter, whether lay-folke ſhould read Scripture, or no, quotes Ioh. 6. to prooue that lay-men haue no right to Scriptures, becauſe the wicked Prieſts ſaid, <hi>Populus qui extra eſt, The people which is without, knowes not the law,</hi> as if ſtill without, and not yet taken into <hi>houſe.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But this by the way onely, becauſe you ſay it is no more then euery priuate man was allowed among the Iewes, to haue the Bible in his houſe. This at leaſt is more on the Kings ſide, then on the priuate mans, that the King in particular <hi>is appointed to haue it, by order from Gods owne mouth, and the Prieſt to yeild it him,</hi> yea the King himſelfe to <hi>write</hi> it out for his owne vſe. <hi>It ſhall be</hi> (ſaies the text) <hi>when he ſitteth vpon the throne of his kingdome, that he ſhall write him a copie of this Law in a booke, out of that which is before the Prieſts, the Leuites.</hi> WHEN HE SITTETH VPON HIS THRONE. Doth not this make a diſtinction betweene the Kings, and the lay-mans hauing of the booke, though neither be forbidden it? Or doth it not ſhew, that the King is entruſted with the book, in reference to his gouernment ouer the whole kingdome? For the booke muſt be offered him, <hi>when he ſitteth vpon the throne of his kingdome</hi> (ſaith the text,) no doubt to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betweene the ende, for which he, and for which ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie men, muſt read the booke, if they read it at all. And what thinke you of that, <hi>that the King muſt write himſelfe a copie?</hi> Is not this too great paines for a King? Which though I doubt not but we may conſtrue, that the King muſt procure one to write it out for him, as <hi>Salomon</hi> is ſaid to ſacrifice when the Prieſts ſacrificed by his appointment, and our Sauiour Chriſt to baptize, though he baptized none himſelfe, but onely through his Diſciples, yet firſt it argues a great entruſting of the King with diuine matters,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:25255:224"/>
to let him haue the Bible ſo much at his diſpoſing, as to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie it out by ſuch as he ſhall ſet a worke. Secondly, it giues him a ſecret <hi>item</hi> to diligence, and to ſtudying of this book, with more then ordinarie carefulnes. And laſtly, as oft as the King changeth, ſo oft (as it may ſeeme) ſhould the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble be tranſcribed, for the vſe of the Crowne, while the Prieſts and the Leuites are enioyned no ſuch taske, for the making of them perfect. <hi>Oleaſter</hi> complaines vpon this place, that it is a wonder to ſee how diſſolute Kings are, touching the ſtudie of lawes, not onely Gods lawes, but their owne; whereas your doctrine, if they are prone of themſelues, as wee are all by nature to ſuch reckleſneſſe, driues them headlong, and ſets them going by authoritie. Yea, you threaten them with great penalties, if at any time they doe but preſume the contrarie, as if they paſſed the bounds of their commiſſion, in ſo doing. But I ſuppoſe <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſter,</hi> when he tooke vp that complaint, was not much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with forreine Kings and Queenes, ſuch as God hath bleſſed our land with ſince, of whome I will ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this place, leaſt I ſhould ſeeme to affect flatterie, though it be hard to paſſe ouer in ſilence ſuch an incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mirrour as we enioy in this kind at this day, God be thanked, and long, moſt long, may we enioy I pray God.

tooke his beginning, that the Kings of Iſrael ſhould be crowned with the booke of the Law in their hand, 1.

As if firſt any thing might well be called priuate in ſo great a Maieſty, or as if the King learning his dutie from the booke of the law, could learne it for himſelfe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not for others, his dutie beeing to ſee that others doe their duties, as euery magiſtrates is, and his fearing of God beeing to feare him not only in the courſe of his owne life, but of his whole gouernement. Yet you pleaſe your ſelfe in your queint language, that the prieſt was to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of a copy of the law, that <hi>he might obſerue it punctually for his owne ſelfe.</hi> Not onely ſo, Sir, but <hi>pungitiuely</hi> for others; he was to make others, euen Prieſts and all, to keepe the law, to enforce them, and to conſtraine them, to pricke them and to driue them onward by the edge of his ſword, which he carried neither edgeles, nor in vaine, Rom. 13. no not then; as <hi>Ezechias</hi> did the Leuits, til he made them offer. <hi>Obtulerunt tandem,</hi> as it is in the Chronicles, by the Kings inſtigation.

The Kings office is not onely <hi>cuſtodire,</hi> but <hi>facere cuſtodiri,</hi> as the <hi>Biſhop</hi> told you, if you had the grace to heare him.

thus alſo is that fulfilled, <hi>Dij eſtis,</hi> whereas our part is <hi>Obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramus vos loco Chriſti, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Cor. 5. See Rom. 13. where all the good that is done in a common wealth, is attributed to the King, all the euill is auenged by him. And 1. Tim. 2. 2. exhorting that praiers and ſupplications be made for all men, he inſtanceth onely in Kings, becauſe the Kings cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes haue an vniuerſall influence, and not onely for a quiet and peaceable eſtate, but for a godly and an honeſt, which refutes the Ieſuites, that thinke a Kings care is to extend no farther then <hi>bonum politicum,</hi> or <hi>bonum reip.</hi> to preſerue the common-wealth from running to confuſion, from want, from plague, from hoſtility, or ſeditions, not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding piety. But moſt notably of all, Pſal. 2. not onely the relligion of a priuate common-wealth, but the conuerſion of the whole bodie of the Gentiles, is linked inſeparably with the relligiouſneſſe of Kings. For hauing ſaid in the 8. verſe, <hi>I will giue thee the Gentiles, for thine inheritance,</hi> he points to the meanes in the 10. and 11. <hi>Be wiſe now therefore ô ye Kings, &amp; nunc Reges intelligite.</hi> Where <hi>&amp; nunc</hi> is preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <note place="margin">
                     <hi>F.

But the Pſal. ſaith, <hi>&amp; nunc,</hi> propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the conuerſion of the Gentiles vnder the new. And further he bids them <hi>ſerue the Lord,</hi> whereas Kings (ſaith S. <hi>Auguſt.)</hi> then ſerue the Lord, when they doe that for <note place="margin">Epiſt. 50.</note> the Lord, which none can doe but they that are Kings. But priuate honeſty, or priuate integritie, is that which euery body may looke to and performe for themſelues. Therefore the Kings Office, which Deuteronomy calls him to, is an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall inſpection. And as the piety of kingdomes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendes of their Kings, as the latter end of the Pſal. ſhewes, that I now quoted, ſo the impiety, and the irreligion of them, is to be referred to none other, as appeares by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning <note place="margin">The people rage, becauſe the Princes ſtand vp, and take part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt.</note> of it.

                  <hi>vt expendant pij lectores, quàm non tutum ſit in rebus tam arduis, &amp;c. Calvine</hi> would haue vs to refraine from worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Sacrament of the Euchariſt for ſafetie ſake. <hi>Quia non tutum. Nam vt Chriſtum illic ritè apprehendant piae animae, in coelum erigantur neceſſe eſt.</hi> For the ſoule that will appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Chriſt rightly in the Sacrament, muſt be lifted vp into heauen, there is no remedie. Can you denie this to be moſt true? He addes yet. <hi>Quid ergo? ſuperſtitioſum eſſe cultum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabimus, cum ſeſe homines coram pane proſternunt, vt Chriſtum illic adorent? Huic malo proculdubio obuiare voluit Nicaena Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodus
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:25255:237"/>
&amp;c.</hi> That is; What then? ſhall we denie that to be a ſuperſtitious kind of worſhip, when men caſt downe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues before a piece of bread, to the end they may worſhip Chriſt there? No doubt the Nicene Councell intended to preuent this miſchiefe, when it forbad vs to be too baſely or ſollicitouſly attentiue about the elements ſet before vs. And for this cauſe the people were wont to be aduertiſed by ſome one ſpeaking in a loud voice, <hi>ſurſum corda,</hi> that they ſhould lift vp their hearts. The Scripture alſo ſhewing vs where to ſeeke Chriſt, bids vs ſeeke him in heauen, at the right hand of his Father, Col. 3. 1. <hi>Secundum hanc regulam e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat potiùs ſpiritualiter in coeleſti gloria adorandus Chriſtus, quàm excogitandum iſtud tam periculoſum adorationis genus, &amp;c.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this rule we ought rather to worſhip Chriſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, and as he is placed in the heauenly glorie, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe this ſo daungerous kind of adoration. Daungerous he calls it, becauſe it may haue euill conſequence, and be of kindred to groſſe and carnall opinions, concerning God, as are his words following in the ſame place; alſo he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres the other before it by a <hi>potiùs,</hi> or by a rather onely, as ſparing the reſt. Laſtly, he thus diſputes, or concludes ſhall I ſay, in his 37. Parag. not farre from the former place. <hi>Chriſto inquiunt hanc venerationem deferimus. Primùm ſi in cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na hoc fieret, dicerem adorationem eam demum eſſe legitimam, qua non in ſigno reſidet, ſed ad Chriſtum in coelo ſedentem dirigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> The queſtion is there about the carrying of the hoſt vp and downe in pompe. And they alleadge for themſelues, ſaith he, that they giue this worſhip to Chriſt. But how does <hi>Calvine</hi> anſwer them? I am firſt to ſay, quoth he, that if this were done of them, at the time of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, neuertheleſſe that worſhip onely were to be counted lawfull, which did not reſt in the element, but roſe vp higher, and were directed to Chriſt ſitting in heauen. Where you ſee he reſiſts the circumgeſtation of the hoſt, rather then the reuerence that belongs to the Lords Supper, and graunts directly, that <hi>in cana ſi hoc fieret,</hi> in the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:25255:237"/>
Lords Supper if this were done (namely that Chriſt were adored there) he would not greatly miſlike it, ſo we ſoared aboue the ſigne, and confined him not to the element, but roſe vp in our cogitations to him, as he is ſitting in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. The <hi>Biſhop</hi> therefore reuolts not from the current of our Diuines, about the worſhipping of the Sacrament, but worſhipping Chriſt whereſoeuer he findes him (for euen <hi>Bellarmine</hi> can tell vs here, that we are not tied to any <note place="margin">Bell. <hi>vbi priùs, ex Ioh.</hi> 4. Non in hoc monte, &amp;c.</note> place, Ioh. 4. ſince the times of the new Teſtament, but that they admit of all alike,) yet willinglieſt riſes aboue the ſphere of the Creation, &amp; conſiders him as apparelled with celeſtiall glorie. This was one.</p>
               <p>§ 13. Another thing that I am to note, of kin to the former, and entangled with the argument of the adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacrament, is this. In ſumme, a groſſe vntruth of the <hi>Adioynders,</hi> Numb. 4. In that quoting the <hi>Biſhops</hi> booke, pag. 201. lin. 8. he ſaies he treats of the ſame matter there, <hi>viz.</hi> of the worſhipping of Chriſt in the Sacrament. Of which not a word, on my word, in that place, but by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of another queſtion about worſhipping Gods foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole, which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> conſtrue to be the fleſh of our Sauiour Chriſt, not any materiall foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole, as the Papiſts would haue it, he ſhews how the fleſh and humane nature of Chriſt may be worſhipped, by the priuiledge of their aſſumption into his Godhead. And he explicates it by the ſimilitude of a King, and his roabe, which participates in a manner of the reuerence done to the King himſelfe. This doe both S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> manifeſtly in that place; I ſay, they ſhew how Chriſts fleſh may be worſhipped with the Godhead, whereas the <hi>Adioynder</hi> ſaies the <hi>Biſhop</hi> teaches by this compariſon, that the fleſh of Chriſt may be adored with the Sacrament, and the Sacrament with it, by vertue of ſuch coniunction. Which is a notable vntruth, as I ſaid before, the <hi>Biſhop</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſinuating any thing to that purpoſe in all that place, and vtterly denying it elſwhere, <hi>viz.</hi> pag. 195. of the ſame
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:25255:238"/>
booke. The Sacrament no where, ſaies he, the earthly part, <note place="margin">lib. 4. c. 34.</note> as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> calls it, but Chriſt euery where is to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. And his fleſh too: but as he declares afterward out of S. <hi>Auſten,</hi> p. 201. lin. 8. as euen now I noted.

For if the pennie be but one, and all receiue that common pennie, then are we not ſaued by our works, which all that are ſaued are not furniſhed with alike, but ſome more, ſome leſſe, as is euident.

Vpon the 1. of Matth. his words, (if any to that purpoſe there at all) are but theſe: <hi>Diſcendum nobis eſt, ne priuati quicquam nobis in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta deligamus. Praecipuè autem ne calibatum arripiamus temerè, hoc eſt, ad iſtud viuendi genus non certo Dei iuſſu vocati, &amp;c.</hi> That is, [We muſt learne to chooſe no priuate [vocation] to our ſelues in this life, and eſpecially that we doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take our ſelues to the ſtate of ſingle life raſhly, that is, not called thither by the certaine appointment of God.] Does <hi>Bucer</hi> ſay here, that we may not pray for continencie, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that we muſt not ruſh vpon it againſt Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and command? As the wiſe man ſaies, <hi>Wiſedom. 8.

T.</hi> would haue cauilled him, for ſaying we might not pray to God for continence, though that be the very thing, which he profeſſes here he prayed for. And does not <hi>Bucer</hi> adde, <hi>Vt nihil priuati deligamus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis?</hi> ſc. <hi>inuito Deo: We muſt chooſe no priuate courſe at all.</hi> By this reaſon then he forbids vs to pray to God for ſcholler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for skill in muſicke, in nauigation, and the like; which who would collect, but ſuch a Huddibraſſe as this <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynder?</hi>

And in the Church of Antioch, his authoritie was acknowledged, by Paulinus the Biſhop thereof, receiuing inſtructions and orders from him for the abſolution of Vitalis the Heretike. Alſo afterwards, Theophilus Biſhop of Alexandria, and S.

               <p>§ 44.

Firſt, becauſe <hi>Satyrus</hi> meant onely in oppoſition to the <hi>Luciferian</hi> ſchiſmatikes, whoſe cauſe was not the cauſe of Eccleſiaſticall Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Secondly, <hi>Satyrus</hi> perhaps might not diſcerne the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, though the Pope had laboured of it, as diuerſe other good men alſo gaue way to it, vnwittingly. Thirdly, a Pope may be right in his beleefe, though he be erroneous in his practiſe, and ſo may any body els. For the theife himſelfe doth not thinke it lawfull to ſteale, nor the man-queller to murther, and yet they both commit the wickednes. Euen ſo the Pope may be <hi>Catholique,</hi> though he ſhould turne cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throate, I meane <hi>Catholique</hi> for his faith, as the Papiſts take it, and ſpeculations only.

For if our Biſhops be true Biſhops (as hauing a true ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles,) and that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Biſhops haue no other lawfull ordination but from ours, two conſequents doe directly follow thereon; the ore, that we haue the true Church and doctrine, if the</hi> Biſhop his <hi>fellow and friend</hi> M.

Supplement; and prooued thereby, that M.

The ſumme is; that when we ſay, <hi>our Biſhops were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by yours,</hi> we meane by ſuch as were firſt ordained by your Biſhops, though not perſiſting in their Relligion hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily. They were yours by Primitiue ordination, not yours by conſtance of profeſſion. And this was enough to make good their act. For the power by them receiued through impoſition of hands, makes them fit ordainers, not the ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe of their faith, or keeping cloſe to the doctrine: or elſe euery faithfull man might be a lawfull ordainer, which you are loath to grant to euery faithfull Prieſt, and much more to Lay-men. It were not hard to ſhewe who conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated the firſt Biſhop in <hi>Queen Elizabeths</hi> time, which was Archbiſhop <hi>Parker.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Barlow</hi> (I trow) was one, firſt Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> then of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> who was made both Prieſt and Biſhop in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. And therefore you may be ſure, by men of your Relli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and by Popiſh Biſhops. Biſhop <hi>Scory</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> firſt, and after of <hi>Hereford,</hi> was another, who was made Prieſt in King <hi>Henries</hi> time, and Biſhop in King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Hodgkin</hi> Suffragan of <hi>Bedford,</hi> made Biſhop in <hi>Queene Maries</hi> time. <hi>Miles Couerdale</hi> Biſhop in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, &amp;c.

The firſt whereof was to King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. two other to the elect himſelfe <hi>Thomas Cant.</hi> the fourth to all the brethren and ſuffragans of the Church of Canterbury: the fifth to the Clergy of the Citie and Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of Canterbury.

But if <hi>Stapleton</hi> and <hi>Harding</hi> bee ſo authenticall with you, that whatſoeuer they once vrge vs with, is ſtraight vnanſwerable, then I confeſſe we are in a wofull caſe.

Are you not aſhamed to confound theſe things ſo groſſely, and vtterly to miſtake the ſtate of the queſtion? If <hi>Harding</hi> and <hi>Stapleton</hi> therefore were ſo conſiderate men, that a falſe imputation could not proceed from them, their meaning was this, <hi>What Biſhop conſecrated you,</hi> that is, <hi>what Popiſh Biſhop or Catholique Biſhop</hi> in your ſenſe?

Bee it enacted, &amp;c. that the King our Soueraigne Lord, his heires, and Succeſſors, Kings of this Realme, ſhall bee taken, accepted, and reputed, the onely Supreame Head of the Church of England, called Anglicana Eccleſia, and ſhall haue and enioy annexed and vnited to the Imperiall Crowne of this Realme, as well the title and ſtyle thereof, as all Honiars, Dignities, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminencies, Iuriſdictions, Priuiledges, Authorities, Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Profits, and Commodities to the ſaid Dignitie of Supreame Head of the ſame Church belonging.</hi> Thus farre belike the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. And what from hence gathereth <hi>Mr. Adioynder?</hi> I will ſet downe his words. <hi>So ſaith the Statute</hi> (quoth hee) <hi>which muſt needes bee vnderſtood to giue ſpirituall authority, when it giueth all that power, Dignity, and Iuriſdiction, which belongeth to the Head of the Church, &amp;c.</hi> Much for ſooth. This <hi>ſpirituall Iuriſdiction</hi> haunts them terribly, you ſee, euerie where ſcares them. But why ſo good now? <hi>For ſeeing that the Church is a ſpirituall and Eccleſiaſticall body, it muſt needs be gouerned by a ſpirituall and Eccleſiaſticall power, reſiding in the Head thereof, &amp;c.</hi> Obſerue his elegancies: <hi>Eccleſia eſt corpus Eccleſiaſticum, The Church is a Church-bodie</hi> firſt. Is not this delicate? But then againe, <hi>The ſame Church is abodie, and yet a ſpirituall bodie,</hi> to <hi>Mr. Adioynder,</hi> in his moſt curious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions. And yet, I hope, not like S. <hi>Paule ſpirituall body,</hi> after the Reſurrection, 1. Cor. 15. which is called <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> becauſe it is plyable and obedient to the motions of the Spirit, (as we are taught by S. <hi>Auſten</hi> in his <hi>Enthiridion)</hi> but as it ſhall pleaſe his wiſedome at more leiſure to interpret. In the meane while, if the Church <hi>becauſe it is a ſpirituall body</hi>
                  <pb n="517" facs="tcp:25255:286"/>
(as he ſpeaks at leaſt) <hi>muſt therefore haue no Head, but one that is endued with like ſpirituall authoritie,</hi> conſider the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, and marke what a confuſion they would bring vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on life, while they wilfully peruert our meaning in the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. For how many are heads and principalls to others, which yet partake not of the faculty that they deale in? And good reaſon. For the perſons of men liuing and conuerſing in ſuch or ſuch a Commonwealth, are ſubiect to the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thereof, and he the <hi>Head</hi> of them; without any refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their particular trades or profeſſions that they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Elſe how ſhall a woman be Queene ouer ſouldiers (as  the Papiſts will not deny but <hi>in temporalibus</hi> ſhee is) and yet no ſouldier, nor fit to beare armes? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> How is a King the  Head of Philoſophers, liuing within his Dominions, whether <hi>Platonickes,</hi> or <hi>Peripatetickes,</hi> or whome you will, though he be neither Maſter nor Diſciple of their ſect, no way ingraffed into their ſocietie? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> How is the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe head of hereticall and Apoſtaticall Prieſts, and yet not  combined with them in their hereſie or Apoſtaſie?

And yet they may proceede againſt the Diuines that are therein, in matters of Chriſtianitie; as for omitting of Sermons, of Theologicall Diſputations, alſo falſe doctrine in them, &amp;c. though they themſelues be no Prieſts, and the others are. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Yea, why may not KINGS beare authoritie  ouer Prieſts, and Spirituall perſons, though themſelues be none, as well as there be diuers Rectors and Gouernours of particular Colledges throughout the Realme (and that alſo perhaps according to the auncient Statutes) who bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Prieſts, nor Spirituall men themſelues, haue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie neuertheles ouer the whole companie, and among the reſt ouer the Prieſts too?

After he had required paſſing accurateneſſe and ſtrictneſſe at their hands, after he had made them tractable both to friends and foes, both to them in proſperity, and them in aduerſitie, to them in want and them that felt no want, to all in generall; after he had ſetled a kind of life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them more fit for Angels then for men; after hee had purged choller, and rebated pride, and euery way ſmoothed ouer their diſpoſitions moſt handſomely; then, I ſay, hee brings in this exhortation. For it ſtands to reaſon, that if we may not requite them with croſſe dealing and euill turnes, that haue iniutied vs firſt, much more ought we to yeeld obedience to them that are beneficiall and kinde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs. But this ſtring the Apoſtle touches not vpon as yet, till towards the latter end of his exhortation. In the meane while, he ſtands onely vpon ſuch reaſons and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as may ſeem to claime it for a <hi>dutie</hi> at our hands. And inſinuating that he giues this precept to all, not onely to temporall men, but to Prieſts and to Monks, his very firſt words import as much, ſaying, <hi>Let euerie ſoule bee ſubiect to the higher powers, [viz.]</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Yet the Pope is not aboue an Apoſtle, I hope, at the higheſt.</note> Though thou beeſt an APOSTLE, though an EVANGELIST, though a PROPHET, or whoſoeuer thou beeſt.
