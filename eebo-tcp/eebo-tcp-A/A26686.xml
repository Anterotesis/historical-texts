            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVE said <note n="*" place="margin">Job 32. 7.</note> days should speak, and waited for the words of the Ancient; But an aged <hi>Paul</hi> would not have others <note n="†" place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 12.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise <hi>Timothy</hi> his youth, much lesse would he do it himself. Your long silence hath made us speak, to utter to you our own troubles, and the sighs and groans of your helpless Flocks. We cannot inform you, but have only writ to <note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 1.</note> 
               <hi>stir you up by way of remembrance,</hi> and humbly to put you in mind, <hi>that you</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 6</note> 
               <hi>stir up the gift of God that is in you,</hi> and suffer not your worthy <note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 25. 25.</note> Talents to be buried in the Napkin, now the sinking Church and dying Religion hath such pressing need for their utmost improvement.</p>
            <p>These Letters are to you in behalf of the poor Flocks, like the man of <hi>Macedonia</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">Acts 16. 9.</note> crying to you, <hi>Come and help us:</hi> or, a Call to <note n="*" place="margin">Col. 4. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Archippus, to take heed to the Ministry that he hath received, that he fulfill it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fathers and Brethren, we unfeignedly reverence you, we magnifie the grace of God in and unto you. Did not we reverence your Parts, Gifts and Graces, and esteem them every way so useful to the Churches, we should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly see you sit still, and never be at the pains to excite you. But our high value of you, hath made us humbly bold to expostulate the case a little with you, and passionately to beseech you, to remember how great a work it is that lies upon you, and to set your hands to it in this time of difficulty.</p>
            <p>Some of yours were the holy hands by which we were called to our Office, when you made us publickly promise (according to the obligation of our Office) that <hi>we would
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58220:3"/>
never, for fear of any persecution, desist from preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel;</hi> and far be it from our Fathers to withdraw, as soon as persecution begins. Suffer us with all modesty and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, to reason with you. Hath not God said, <hi>Necessity is laid on you, and VVO unto you if you preach not the Gespel?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 16.</note> Who shall free you from that <hi>Wo,</hi> or loose your bonds of that <hi>necesse,</hi> if yet you sit still in silence?</p>
            <p>Shall we mind you of <hi>Pauls</hi> example and charge? No bonds nor afflictions could move him, nor make him shun <note place="margin">Acts 20. 23, 24, 27.</note> to declare the <hi>whole counsel of God.</hi> And how strict is the command, <hi>That you take heed to your selves, and all the</hi>

               <hi>Flock, over whom the holy Ghost hath made you Bishops?</hi> And let it be noted, how pertinent the motive is, <hi>Because grievous</hi>

               <hi>Wolves are entred in, not sparing the Flock:</hi> And will you, at such a time, give over your care for the Flock? Are we not most dreadfully <hi>charged, besore God, and our Lord Jesus</hi>

               <hi>Christ, and the elect Angels, to observe these things, and to preach the Word, and be instant, and reprove, rebuke, exhort with all LONG SUFFERING?</hi> and shall we flinch at the beginning of any Suffering?

            <p>Are not you the Shepherds of the Flocks? And shall the true Shepherds flee, as <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 10. 12</note> soon as they see the Wolves, and leave the Sheep? When should they shew their care and diligence, their solicitude and watchfulness, if not when the beasts of prey come to tear, and to destroy?</p>

            <p>Finally, Hath not the Lord ordained you to be his <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 29, 39.</note> Prophets? and shall not your souls be moved, neither at the thundering Charge at the entrance, nor the sweet Promise in the close of those piercing and powerful words, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 17, 18. <hi>Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise and speak unto them all that I command thee; be not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed at their fears, lest I confound thee before them: For behold I have made thee this day, a defenced City, and an iron Pillar, and brazen wals against,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And they shall fight against thee, but shall not prevail against thee, for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.</hi> The passage seems like the stormy Wind, the amazing Earthquake, and the Fire of God, in the Vision of the Prophet, ending in the <note place="margin">1 King. 19. 11, &amp;c.</note> sweet, soft and still Voice.

            <p>Suffer us to stay you a while with a few serious Questions, which in all humility we do request you, to let your grave considerations dwell for a time upon. We beseech you, let not our importunity be grievous, nor our words seem tedious, in so pondrous and important a case.</p>
            <p>But to prevent misunderstandings in what we say, we must be forced more than we would to lengthen, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising a three-fold Caution.</p>
            <p>We would not be so understood in any thing, as if we <note place="margin">Caut. 1.</note> did undervalue the Sufferings of our most deserving Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, or were unthankful to God, or them, that they have so manfully stood for the <hi>TRUTH,</hi> and resisted the strong Temptations to sinful compliance, even to the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58220:4"/>
peril of their Families, the loss of Goods and Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and their beloved Imployment amongst their dear People. We must, we do, and shall while we live, bless the Lord for this their Courage and Constancy; that they have kept the Word of His Patience, and have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied His Name: And have born their publick Testimony against the Corruptions of the times; though we are forced (with submission) to mind them, what pity it is, that they that did run so well, should not reach to the end of their race.</p>
            <p>We would not be understood, as if we did lay the <note place="margin">Caut. 2.</note> blame of silence upon all our Fathers and Brethren, that have been thrust out for Conscience towards God. We know there are of them, and that not a few, (Glory be to God) that are harder at work than ever; labouring in season, and out of season, by night and by day; whose Reward is with the Lord, yea, a great Reward, <hi>and their praise throughout all the Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We would not have what we speak of the present Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, <note place="margin">Caut. 3.</note> to be understood <hi>de omni.</hi> We may not without grievous breach of Charity deny, but some few (alas too few) are pious, sedulous, as well as singularly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with learning and abilities; but we speak only of the generality; and would to God their lives and labours would confute our too just complaints.</p>
            <p>After these Cautions, we humbly subjoyn a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Questions.</p>
            <div type="questions">
               <p>Whether you think in your hearts, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry <note place="margin">Quest. 1.</note> that now is, will ever keep up the Power of Godliness? O that we could but charitably believe it! But who can deny his senses! Alas! how should Christ's Kingdom and Interest, and the Power of Holiness be suported by these hands? If Idleness will do it, if Ignorance will do it, if Loosness will do it, if Malice will do it, then these
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58220:5"/>
men will bear up the Power of Godliness. Do you not know that too many of them hate it, both name and thing? do not they plainly make it, not the <hi>Prize</hi> they aim at, but the <hi>But</hi> they shoot at? These things are a Lamentation, and shall be for a Lamentation. In this we know you are sufficently convinced.</p>
               <p>Whether you can see Religion sinking, falling, dying away, and you never put your hands and <note place="margin">Quest. 2.</note> shoulders to it, and yet be blameless? Fathers and Brethren, you are the <note n="*" place="margin">Josh. 3. 14.</note> shoulders that must bear up the Ark of the Lord. Do not your <note n="†" place="margin">1 Sam. 4. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>hearts tremble for the Ark of GOD?</hi> Do you see it falling, and yet withdraw your shoulders, and keep your hands in your bosomes? you would condemn that man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly, as void of Christian Charity, yea, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon humanity, that should not take up his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and labour to chafe and rub, and recover him to life when fallen down by you in a swooning <note place="margin">Esth. 4. 14.</note> fit. Fathers, where then are your Bowels? where are your Compassions, and your Zeal for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of Christ and Holiness: If you see Religion it self in this swooning fit, and hast not with your utmost help, will the Lord hold you guiltless, <hi>if you should altogether hold your peace at such a time as this?</hi>

For the Lord's sake bear with us to be a little plain with you; Are your souls sensible of the Famine upon the Land, or are they not? if not (as we cannot, we dare not, we do not think so of you Fathers; for we doubt not your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity with God) you were, we will not say no Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but not so much as true Children or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, having no Natural Affection, no Christian Sympathy. If you are indeed sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Famine, how can you keep in the Corn? Surely the Voyce of God to a withholding-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, seems like that, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Arise, Cry out in the Night, in the beginning of the Watches; pour out thine heart like water before the Lord; lift up thine hands towards him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street:</hi> It grieves us to urge what yet we cannot keep in.

To be plain, the People are willing and forward to venture with you; and to run the resk of it, and shall their Leaders be more backward than they? Were you like to be alone it were more excusable; But they are ready to suffer with you, and run all hazards that may come upon them for their duty in hearing: and shall we only stand back? shall not a willing People, make a willing Ministry?

Whether you will not put a reproach into the <note place="margin">Quest. 6.</note> mouths of our Adversaries, and give them occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to speak evil of our Office, when you shall be found to give over the Work, as soon as ever the Pay doth cease? Our hearts do honour you, but there be that reproach you as Hirelings, which they now strengthen themselves in, and more confidently and colourably than ever, perswade others off; (first) Because you give over the Work as soon as ever the Maintenance do fail. (Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) Because (they say) you flee as soon as the Woolf doth approach, and will not bide by the Sheep, when your liberty and outward comfort is thereby like to be in danger.

               <p>Whether you had your Commission, Office and <note place="margin">Quest. 7.</note> Authority from the Magistrate, and your Power in, and relation to the Church, be of a Civil Stamp? We know the Magistrate doth not pretend to this: And if none but Christ did, nor could Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate you, can any but He discharge you? or can the Relation between the Church and you (if Divine and Spiritual) cease upon the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of a Power meerly Political, which is <hi>toto genere</hi> distinct? If the Magistrate did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute and cause this Relation, how can he make it to cease? or take away what (confessedly) he

cannot give? were not this to make it to be at the Magistrates pleasure whether Christ shall have any Ministry or no? any Service or no? whether there shall be any Preaching or not? and so indeed, whether God shall have any Church or no? And if the Magistrate cannot make your Relation to the Church to cease, how can he make the Duty of that Relation to cease? sith the shadow doth not more naturally and necessarily follow the substance, than the Duty doth the Relation. In a word; Will it be a sufficient Answer, at God's Righteous Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the Lord shall ask us why we did not preach the Gospel as he had <hi>bid</hi> us? to say, Lord, it was because the Magistrate did <hi>forbid</hi> us. God is our Record in Heaven, that we are of those that do unfeignedly fear the Lord, and honour the King; to whom we shall ever yeeld obedience <hi>in licitis,</hi> deny submission <hi>in nullis.</hi> Only we are afraid, that it will not be sufficient in that dreadful day, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Magistrates Warrant for our discharge, when directly contradicting the <hi>tremendous</hi> Charge of our Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>who shall judge both quick and dead at his appearing.</hi> We verily fear, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates Dispensation will not be allowed before his Tribunal; and then what a sorry case were we in, should we desist thereupon from our work?</p>
               <p>Whether God hath forsaken those of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, that have set to their work, since the day of <note place="margin">Quest. 8.</note> that fatal stroke? or, whether he hath not owned them by his Assistance, Presence, Approbation, and the ample Testimonies of his Favour, &amp; honoured his Name and Gospel by their Labours, Tryals, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonments,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58220:7"/>
and Sufferings whatever, that they have endured? Hath the Gospel lost ground by them? It may be enquired, Whether there be any place for Repentance in their prisons, (where they have time enough to reflect upon their actions and correct what was amiss) or whether they are not for ever settled, strengthened, and doubly confirmed in their resolutions, by their Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts and encouragments? and whom should we believe in this, sooner then those that have tryed the worst?</p>
               <p>There is another Question, that we fear to put to <note place="margin">Quest. 9.</note> you, But will rather let the Apostle himself ask you, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 16, 17, 18. <hi>Whoso hath the worlds goods</hi> (and we add, much more, whoso hath the heavenly Goods to dispence) <hi>and seeth his Brother</hi> (much more his distressed Mother) <hi>hath need, and shutteth up his Bowels of compassion from him, How dwelleth the Love of God in him?</hi>

or Bonds, unless in order to his Glory? Let us but live in the power of this acknowledged Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>That it is our business and our blessedness to glorifie God,</hi> and all will be set at rights. If that be true, then that is the best condition, wherein we may best glorifie God, and the happiness of every estate, is to be esteemed, according to the order and reference that it hath to this end. Now then, let God glorifie himself in us, and it cannot but be well. What should you then do but set to the Work? For either God will preserve your Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and then you will wonderfully glorifie him by your acting and venturing your selves for him; or else he will send you to Prison, and then you will more glorifie him by suffering, lying there as the Publick Hostages of the Churches, and Witnesses of God's Truth; Besides that it may render you the more serviceable in your Generation all your dayes after. But how little is God glorified by you either way, while you sit still? Or, are you not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Offence, and a grief to the spirits of the Godly, weakning the hands of your Active Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and wounding the spirits of your dear Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?

Never had you such an open and effectual door for the doing good to souls, whether for Conversion or Edification. Now the hearts of the People cleave to you more than ever, if you lose them not by your own neglect. Now they see the difference between the Precious and the Vile; between the Hay and Stubble of the present materials, and the Gold and Silver that you did build with; between the burning and shining Lights, and the stinking and loathsome Snuffs.

               <p>If you think it would not be so with you, we fear it is either, first, for want of experience, because you have not tryed; or, secondly, (if we may presume to be so plain) through the neglect of too many, who are otherwise Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, but have here through their own supineness, suffered the affections of People to dye, and the coal of Religious Zeal to go out, for want of blowing. But if they will but blow up this sacred Fire out of the Ashes, and lay the Coals together, and give their People to taste of the pure Milk of the Word, we miss our mark, if they want an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Auditory, unless where Religion, in the most professing times, hath been a stranger. Awake then, for now is the time for you to settle your selves for ever in the Affections of your People. Now you may prove your love to them, as you never could before, by hazarding your selves for their good. Now you may prove their love to your Ministry, and to the Wayes of God, as never you could till now.</p>

Affections, for the Lord's sake, hath the directest way in the world to their hearts, and the fairest advantage pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to serve God's Interest upon them, and further his Work in them, which every gracious Minister must needs value above all this worlds goods, as that upon which the success of his Ministry, for winning and furthering souls, doth wonderfully depend.</p>

What a loude refutation of their callum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies would your engaging to purpose in the work of God be at such a time as this? All sorts of men have been ready to take up prejudices against us, as Self-seekers, and such as looked little further than their Maintenance. Now pluck up these prejudices by the roots: now shew you can serve the Lord for nought. What lewd lyes will all these imputations appear to be, if the Lord stir you up to holy an activity? We can but touch upon your own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as indeed, we cannot dwell upon any thing, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so much to say in a little. When had you such an advantage to get setled Assurance and Peace as now? You can tell us better then our selves, (who yet blessed be God, speak what we have seen and felt) that the most self-denying services are the best evidences, and so bring in greatest comforts. When was there such a time to lay up treasure in Heaven as now? You know the massyest Crown is for them that endure the hardest service.</p>
               <p>But we see there are many Lions in the way. The flesh is loth to labour (much more to suffer) but cryes, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster spare thy Self,</hi> and will find an hundred Arguments to turn off a costly and hazardous duty. We dispair the work will be done without removing the prejudices, and therefore shall not dissemble the difficulties and objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that be in the way.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. Was not this the Apostles case again and again? were not they commanded, <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 4. 18, 19.</note> yea strictly charged, not to preach any more? But did they give over? Why should not we answer with them, <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 5. 28, 29, 40, 42.</note> 
                  <hi>It is better to obey God than man?</hi> Doth God charge us so deply, so dreadfully, and shall we think our selves discharged if man contradict it? If the Magistrate should be thought indeed to have such a power of Dispensations, will not here be a fine easy way for idle Drones to shift the Yoke, and leave the Plow? for 'twil but be to get an Order from above for not Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and then when the Chief Shepherd shall appear, to pluck out his Indulgence, and no more can be said. But we fear God will not be so put off. Are not God's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Messengers, <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 5. 20. Jer. 1. 17.</note> yet charged by Him to <hi>speak without fear,</hi> and that under a dreadful penalty, and shall we fear man's <hi>wrath</hi> for preaching, more than God's <hi>WO</hi> if we preach not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repl.</hi> But it is said, <hi>Here is Preaching though we sit still: Whereas then the Gospel was wholly forbidden to be preached, and so would have been extinct if they had obeyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. 'Tis true here is preaching, but if not by <hi>us,</hi> how badly have we answered, the formidable charge of Almighty God to us, or our sacred and solemn vows to him? Will our Lord be put off by this, as a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent answer for our loytering, that others were a labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. There is indeed a Ministry, and Preaching (such as it is) but whether such as is like to answer the ends of either, judge you. What are the next ends of the Ministry in sum, but <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 26. 18</note> 
                  <hi>Conversion</hi> and <note n="*" place="margin">Ephes. 4. 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Edification?</hi> and are these like to convert souls, that have neither <hi>will</hi> nor <hi>skill</hi> to deal with them about their Conversion, but perswade them they are all regenerated and converted already? O how evidently do they <note n="†" place="margin">Matth. 23. 15.</note> harden them in their sins (for the most part) both by their Doctrine and Lives, in stead of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58220:11"/>
turning them from them! And are they like to edify in holiness, who are apparently the venemous Enemies of Holiness? who for strict and precise walking (without which no man shall see God) do openly, though covert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, inveigh against it, as needless niceness, and the worst of folly. Now if we have a Ministry, but such as doth not answer the ends of a Ministry, how few degrees are we the better for them than if we had none?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Your eyes will convince you, if you will but look abroad, that where there is no better help, than of an Idle, Ignorant, Loose-living Ministry (under which rank God knows, we speak it with grief of heart, too many, not to say the most of those that are late come in, may be reckoned) or than the cold and heartless way that is generally in use; the Coal of Religion doth even go out, and the Heat and Spirit of Christianity dye away: And is it not high time then, for you to blow up the remaining sparks?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 2. Is it so indeed, our Reverend Fathers and Brethren, is it conscience of the Magistrates prohibition that keeps you back (bear with us if we be a little free with you) Why then do you neglect what you might do, without crossing the Magistrate's command? if men did see you go so far as the Magistrate gives you leave, they would be likely to believe, the conscience of his Authority did keep you in; otherwise they will suspect this (too too ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly) for a pretext. If the Magistrate doth forbid Sermons to your People, he doth not forbid Letters. Why do you not call upon and quicken them frequently by these? If he forbid you the Pulpits, he doth not forbid you your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours houses. Why are they no more visited? may you not preach to a private Family, or single person? <note n="*" place="margin">See Christ &amp; his Apostles preaching in private houses (now called <hi>Conventicling) Mark</hi> 3. 19, 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7, 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 42. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 2, 14.

was our Saviours, and the Apostles preaching, oft-times. You might be the shorter and the oftner this way, and this would be a likely means of doing no little good, if pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully followed. Though you are forbidden to set open the Windows and keep Publick Trading, yet what hinders but that you may have a private Warehouse? Is it forbidden you to write out a Sermon once or twice a week and send it amongst your People, and let it be read in their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and Copies conveyed from hand to hand. This some have done, and this would be a Testimony to your People of your constant care for their souls, and that you are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do what you thought you <hi>lawfully</hi> might: whereas now they will say, they see the contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But <hi>Abiathar</hi>'s quiet Secession is objected, who <hi>('tis said)</hi> when thrust out of the Office of the Priesthood, did not turbulently busie himself in doing the work of that Office, but retired to a private life, and dwelt quietly in his own house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> This is not an Objection for the friends of our Call and Office to make; the case between him and us being so wonderfully disproportionate, as we might many wayes shew. We shall instance but in four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Abiathar,</hi> as it seems, had no right to the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: for it did, by right, belong to another Line. For <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 2, 27. see <hi>Zadok</hi> his pedigree and heirship, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Promise to <hi>Phinehas. Num.</hi> 25. 13. and consult the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Annotations</hi> on 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 26, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Abiathar</hi> was of the line of <hi>Eli,</hi> who it is not known how he came to the Priesthood: Whereas <hi>Zadok</hi> (put in in his room) was the son of <hi>Phinehas,</hi> and heir in a direct line to <hi>Aaron,</hi> and so seems to have the right of Priesthood belonging to him, both by lineal descent, being the proper heir to it, and also by God's special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Abiathar</hi> was put out by two Princes, who were <note place="margin">1 Chr. 29. 22 1 King. 2. 27</note> inspired by God, (and who knows but they may do it by extraordinary direction?) by <hi>David,</hi> who anointed <hi>Zadok</hi> Priest in his room, while he was yet living; and also by <hi>Solomon,</hi> ratifying his Fathers Act.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:58220:12"/>
3. When <hi>Abiathar</hi> was thrust out, <note n="†" place="margin">1 Chro. 29. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Zadok</hi> (not <hi>Hophni</hi> or <hi>Phinehas)</hi> was put in his room; a man <note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 44. 15.</note> owned and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God, sufficiently, yea <note n="†" place="margin">2 Sam. 15. 27.</note> eminently fitted for the Work; so that he might recede, without fear of miscarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Work of the Lord, by the ignorance or wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of him that it was entrusted with. Were this the case here, that your Work were put into the hands of the best of men, and like to be better carried on by those, to whom 'tis now committed, than before: Yea, if it were not like to sink and fail, we should not think our selves so much concerned, to offer these ungrateful lines unto you.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Above all, <hi>Abiathar</hi> had <note n="†" place="margin">1 King. 1.</note> forfeited his place by his Treason; so that the King might justly have cut off his Person and Priesthood too: for, he was <hi>a man of death,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 26. and the Sentence of death <note n="*" place="margin">See the <hi>Dutch</hi> Divines, on 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> is thought to have held him under, so that he should be only upon his good-behaviour, and responsible for his crime up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any new provocation.</p>
               <p>Object. 3. <hi>But it's further said,</hi> This will be a great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Separation, if Ministers set up in private, and draw away a great part of the People from the Service of God in Publick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. The Separation be upon others, who when we were quietly setled in the administration of Church-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, in a more pure and reformed sort, are come in upon us, and have possessed our Places and Pulpits, and thrust us by the places of publick Convention. We continue still but in the same station, and the same work, <note n="†" place="margin">Luke 2. 8. 1 Pet. 5. 2.</note> watching over our Flocks, and administring according to our Office, with no other difference, but only that the place is altered; which being at the Magistrates dispose, we quietly left it, according to our duty upon his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yea, your not preaching will occasion Separation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: for whither will the People run headlong, if not stayed and guided by the interposition of your wisdom and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58220:13"/>
prudence? Your moderation will be the likeliest means to keep them from extreams: for you are they that have their hearts; by others they will not be guided. For this, experience affords abundant instances, and too sad proof; People every where joyning themselves to the greatest of Separatists, rather then they will rest satisfied with live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Jejune, sapless Administrations, offered withal by hands so unclean, and in vessels so impure, as somewhere they are.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What is done in private, may be so prudently and inoffencively managed, as to the season, as that (in case you and others are so satisfied) you, and they, may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and timely attend, what is done in publick, and shew your readiness to Unity and Peace, though you bear your Testimony against the Corruptions that are on foot, evidencing your non-acquiescence in such impure and imperfect modes of Administration and Ignorant and Ungodly Dispencers, as too generally use them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The most commendable endeavours after Christian Unity, must be conjunct with a study of Gospel-Purity and the Power of Godliness, together with the testifying of our vehement anhelation after it, and our vigorous endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours (in all lawful and peaceable means) for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. But how this should be evidenced and effected (not to mention the hardning of others to think they are in the right, and all is well) when men do fully jump in with all that is on foot and acquiesce in it, looking for no farther help, we cannot well understand.</p>
               <p>Obj. 4. <hi>But it is added,</hi> That this will destroy God's Publick Worship, and alienate men from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. It is not the place, but the company conveened, that makes the Worship to be publick. The Meeting is publick, and so the Worship publick, though the place may not be publick: Else there was no Publick Worship in the time of great Persecution, when the Assemblies of Christians <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 20. 8. Act. 12. 12.</note> Met by stealth in private houses.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:58220:13"/>
2. It hath been already shewed, that there is a possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of doing this, without neglecting the Ordinances of God more publickly dispensed.</p>
               <p>Obj. 5. <hi>But there is a secret and most forcible Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction yet behind, which we fear lies with many at the bottom, though it come not so freely out;</hi> That this is against our safety, and will certainly expose us to Persecution; and for a man to adventure himself for an opportunity or two, to so great a hazard, as to become a miserable Captive, and a prey to the Sons of violence, seems but folly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. Why then do you neglect that of your work which would not expose to Pesecution? cannot you dwell with your People, and keep the oversight of them, and watch to see when danger approaches, and give them warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (though more privately) whereby to prevent their Ruine? We humbly conceive, it is a part, and no little part of a Ministers duty <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 5. 42. Col. 1. 28. Act. 20. 20.</note> personally to instruct his People and to visit his Charge, and to preach from house to house, and that distinct from publick preaching: now this would not expose you to any suffering, and yet how sadly is this neglected? There was a time when this duty, being urged, the great objection against it was, because Ministers had not time from their publick Imployments. Brethren, let us deal plainly with God and with men; Why then is this great Duty now neglected? Now when we have little else to do; especially since 'tis acknowledgly the great duty of Ministers, and they may do it with safety, and be greatly instrumental in it: And have now few other wayes to edify their People; Is it for want of time now that they do not do it? or from the multitude and weight of their publick Imployments? But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is it true indeed, shall the fear of Persecution make us desist from the work that God hath committed to us with such a dreadful charge to fulfil it? wherein we may fo wonderfully glorify him that sent us, and in the doing whereof, the saving of our own and our Peoples souls is so much concerned: Will not the People say that our own
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58220:14"/>
safty is dearer to us, either than their souls, or our own, yea than God's Glory, if this should keep us back? as we verily fear this will be found the greatest <hi>Remora.</hi> We do but desire that conscience may plainly speak in the case, and tell men truly, whether if this were removed, they would not fall forthwith to their Work. But hath not God said <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 5. 10, 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Blessed are they that are persecuted for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. Blessed are ye when men persecute you and revile you, &amp;c. Rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your Reward in Heaven: For so persecuted they the Prophets which were before you?</hi> Hath not He assured us we shall <note n="†" place="margin">Mark 10. 29, 30.</note> come off no losers by him, <hi>but shall have an hundred-fold even with Persecution;</hi> yea, and that in this time, <hi>and in the World to come Life Eternal?</hi> Is it not really <note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 1. 29.</note> a Glorious Priviledge to suffer for Christ, and a <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 5. 41.</note> Badg of singular Honour? Have the former Saints thirsted for the Crown of Martyrdom, and <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 6. 14. 2 Cor. 12. 9. Rom. 5. 3.</note> gloried in the Cross of Christ? And is a Fine or a Prison enough to stop the mouths of Gods Servants nowadays by the hundreds? Is it indeed <note n="†" place="margin">Jam. 1. 12.</note> all joy to fall into divers temptations, and are <hi>we</hi> afraid to venture? Where doth the <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 14.</note> Spirit of God and of Glory rest but upon suffering Saints? By <note n="†" place="margin">ibid.</note> whom is God Glorified so much as by his suffering Witnesses? By what is the Gospel <note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 1. 12.</note> more furthered than by the Bonds and Tribulations of its Ministers? What better way to ensure the <note n="†" place="margin">Jam. 1. 12.</note> Crown of Life, and get the <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 5. 10.</note> double Portion in the Blessing, than by enduring Temptations and Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions for the Gospel? What will so much <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 5. 3, 4. Jam. 1. 3.</note> intend our Graces, further our experiences, help on Mortification, and <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 16, 17.</note> inhance our Eternal Glory, as our patient bearing for Christ?</p>
               <p>Brethren, what will work upon us, if we will be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned neither by the consideration of God's Glory, nor our own? Hath Christ suffered for us, both as our <note n="†" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 21 &amp; 3. 18.</note> Surety, and Pattern? and have we such a Cloud of Martyrs, that have so stoutly led the Van? and shall <hi>We</hi> shift off our Work for fear of Persecution? Let us humbly request you
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58220:14"/>
but to view the encouraging Promises, that Christ hath made to Sufferers for his Name, which we can but hint, not handle, and let us submissively reason with you; Are not these the very things which we have over and over preached, and pressed on our People? and shall we make them believe, by our flinching, that these things were not so? Bear with us, we beseech you; Are these things true, or are they not? If not, why have we taught them? if they be, why do we not live up to them? O that we did but act as if we our selves had believed in what we have preached! Will it not be a real confutation of what we have taught concerning the blessed Advantage and Glory of the Cross, if we (when put to it) shall decline the Cross, notwithstanding all the blessedness, we made People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, we thought to be in it? God forbid that <hi>We</hi> should tempt men to Atheism and Infidelity; and make them believe, there is no more in Preaching, no more in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, than a flourishing talk.</p>

               <p>But now it is time to think of closing. We fear we have been tedious and troublesome; but suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us yet to utter a few sighs more unto you. We should not have thus pressed and presumed upon you, had not the necessity of the case required it. Reverend and Beloved, if we cannot prevail with you; yea rather, if God (that hath the power of hearts) do not prevail with you, poor souls will rue it, and Christ's Honour and Interest will suffer for it, his Gospel will be a great loser by it. Pardon us therefore if we are loth to let you go: fain we would that you should not be at the end of this Paper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath attain'd its end; That you should not turn away your eyes from these Lines, till you have

Who shall chuse our words for us? Alas, that we did but know what would pierce! It grieves us to think we should have done, before the Work be done; and that after all this, we should leave you as we found you.
