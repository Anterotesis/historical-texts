            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He main designe of the Apostle in this <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
to the Hebrews,</hi> is to prevail with his
Countrey-men who had undertaken the
Profession of the Gospel, to abide constant
and faithfull therein, without any <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie</hi>
unto or mixture with <hi>Judaisme,</hi> which
God and themselves had forsaken, fully manifesting, that
in <hi>such back-sliders the soul of the Lord hath no pleasure.</hi> Chap.

            <p>A Task, which whoso undertaketh in any Age, shall

Professors to hold out,<note place="margin">Chap. 10. 36.</note> and continue in the glory of their
profession unto the end,<note place="margin">Prov. 22. 13. 26. 13.</note> that <hi>with patience doing the will of

he requires us to enjoy.</hi> Yea, <hi>Da Domine quod jubes, &amp; jube quod

thou pleasest.</p>
            <p>As a <hi>Duty</hi> it is by the Apostle here considered, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
pressed on them, who by Nature were capeable, and
by Grace enabled for the performance thereof. Patheticall
exhortations then unto perseverance in the profession of
the Gospel, bottomed on prevalent Scripturall Arguments,
and holy Reasonings, are the <hi>summe</hi> of this Epistle.</p>
            <p>The Arguments the Apostle handleth unto the End pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
are of two sorts:</p>
            <p>1. Principall.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Deductive,</hi> or Emergencies from the first.</p>
            <p>1. His <hi>principall</hi> Arguments are drawn from two chief
Fountains:</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Author,</hi>
And,</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The</hi> Nature and End of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Author</hi> of the Gospel is either</p>
            <p>1. Principall and immediate, <hi>which is God the Father,</hi>
Who having at sundrie times and in divers manners formerly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the Prophets, herein speaketh by his Son; <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 1.</p>
            <p>2. Concurrent and immediate, <hi>Jesus Christ, this</hi> great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being begun to be spoken to us by the Lord. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
            <p>This latter he chiefly considereth, as in and by whom
the Gospel is differenced from all other dispensations of
the minde of God.</p>
            <p>Concerning him to the End
intended, he proposeth
<list>
                  <item>1. His <hi>Person,</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. his <hi>Employment.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For his <hi>Person,</hi> that thence he may argue to the thing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55671:4"/>
aymed at, he holdeth out,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The infinite glory of his</hi> Deity: <hi>being the</hi> Brightnesse of
his Fathers glory, and the expresse Image of his Person: <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The infinite</hi> Condescension of his Love, <hi>in assuming</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
<hi>for because the</hi> children were pertakers of flesh and blood,
he also himself took part of the same. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
            <p>And from the consideration of both these, he presseth
the main Exhortation which he hath in hand, as you may
see, Chap. 2. 1, 2. Chap 3. 12, 13, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Employment of Christ he describeth in his offices,
which he handleth</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Positively,</hi> and very briefly, Chap. 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Comparatively,</hi> insisting chiefly on his Priesthood, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting
in sundrie weighty particulars, above that of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
which yet was the glory of the Jewish worship, and
this at large, Chap. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>And <hi>this</hi> being variously advanced and asserted, he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
as the main foundation, upon which he placeth the
weight and stresse of the main end pursued, as in the whole
Epistle is every where obvious.</p>
            <p>II. The second head of <hi>principall</hi> Arguments he taketh
from the Gospel it self, which considering as a <hi>Covenant</hi> he
holdeth out two wayes:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Absolutely,</hi> in its
efficacy in respect of
<list>
                  <item>1. Justification, <hi>in it</hi> God is mercifull
to unrighteousnesse and sins, and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
he remembers no more: <hi>Chap.</hi>
8. 12. Bringing in perfect remission, that
there shall need no more offering for sin:
<hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 17.</item>
                  <item>2. Sanctification, He puts his Laws
in our hearts, and writes them in our
minds, <hi>Chap. 10. 16. in it,</hi> purging
our consciences by the blood of Christ,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 9. 14.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Perseverance, I will be to them a
God, and they shall be to me a people:</hi>
Chap. 8. 10. all three being also
held out in sundrie other places.</item>

2. <hi>Respectively</hi> to the Covenant of works, and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
assignes unto it principall qualifications, with many
peculiar eminencies them attending, too many now to be
named: now these are,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That it is</hi> new, <hi>he saith a</hi> New Covenant, and hath made
the first old. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 13.</p>
            <p>2. Better; <hi>it is a</hi> better Covenant, and built upon better
promises: <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 6, 7. 22</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Surer,</hi> the Priest thereof being ordained, not after the
Law of a carnall commandment, but after the power of an
endly life: Chap. 7. 16.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Vnalterable,</hi> so in all the places before named, and
sundry others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All</hi> which are made eminent in its peculiar Mediator
Jesus Christ, which is the summe of Chap. 7.</p>
            <p>And still in the holding out of these things, that they
might not forget the end for which they were now drawn
forth, and so exactly handled, he interweaves many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theticall
intreaties, and pressing Arguments by way of
Application, for the confirming and establishing his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men
in the faith of this glorious Gospel, as you may
see almost in every Chapter.</p>
            <p>2. His Arguments <hi>lesse principall,</hi> deduced from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
being very many, may be referred to these 3. heads.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>benefits</hi> by them enjoyed under the Gospel.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>example</hi> of others, who by faith and patience ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the promises: Chap. 11.</p>
            <p>3. From the <hi>dangerous and pernicious consequence</hi> of back-sliding,
of which onely, I shall speak. Now <hi>this</hi> he setteth
out 3. wayes.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>From the nature of that sin, it is a</hi> crucifying to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the Son of God afresh, and putting him to open shame. <hi>Chap.</hi>
6. 6. <hi>a</hi> treading under foot the Son of God, counting the blood of
the Covenant an unholy thing, and doing despite to the Spirit of
grace: <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 29.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The irremedilesse punishment which attends that sin:</hi>
There remains no more sacrifice for it, but a certain fearfull look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for of judgement, and fiery indignation that shall consume the
adversaries: <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 26, 27.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:55671:5"/>
3. The <hi>Person</hi> against whom peculiarly it is committed,
and that is he who is the Author, subject, and Mediator of
the Gospel, the Lord Jesus Christ; concerning whom for
the aggravation of this sin, he proposeth two things.</p>
            <p>1. His <hi>Goodnesse and Love,</hi> and that in his great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
to be a Saviour, being <hi>made like unto his brethren in all
things, that he might be a mercifull and faithfull high Priest in
things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the
people:</hi> Chap. 2. 17. and of <hi>this,</hi> there is a sweet and choise
line, running through the whole Discourse, making the sin
of back-sliding, against so much love and condescension
appear exceeding sinfull.</p>
            <p>2. His <hi>Greatnesse or Power,</hi> which he sets out 2. wayes:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Absolutely,</hi> as he is God to be blessed for ever: Chap. 1
and <hi>it is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of the living God:</hi>
Chap. 10. 31.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Comparatively,</hi> as he is the Mediator of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
in reference to <hi>Moses.</hi> And <hi>this</hi> he setteth forth as
by many and sundry Reasonings in other places of the
Epistle, so by a double testimony in this 12<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> Chapter,
making that inference from them both, which you have
<hi>v. 25. See that you refuse not him that speaketh, for if they escaped
not who refused him who spake on earth, how much more shall not we
escape if we turn away from him who speaketh from heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the first <hi>testimony</hi> of his Power, is taken from a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi>
of what he did <hi>heretofore;</hi> the other, from a <hi>prediction</hi> of
what he will do <hi>hereafter.</hi> The first you have, <hi>v.</hi> 26. in the
first part of it: <hi>His voice THEN shook the Earth: then,</hi> that
is, when the <hi>Law</hi> was delivered by him, as it is described
<hi>v.</hi> 18, 19, 20. foregoing. When the <hi>mountain,</hi> upon which
it was delivered,<note place="margin">Exod. 19. 18, 19</note> the Mediator <hi>Moses,</hi> into whose hand it
was delivered, and the <hi>people,</hi> for whose use it was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
did all shake and tremble,<note place="margin">Chap. 20. 18.</note> at the voice, power and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Christ, who, as it hence appears, is that <hi>Jehovah</hi>
who gave the Law. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 2.</p>
            <p>The <hi>other</hi> in the same verse is taken from a <hi>prediction,</hi> out
of <hi>Haggai,</hi> 2. 16. of what he will do hereafter, even demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
and make evident his Power beyond what ever he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55671:6"/>
before effected, <hi>He hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake
not the earth onely, but also the heavens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if any one shall ask, wherein this effect of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
power of the Lord Jesus consisteth, and how from thence
professors may be prevailed upon to keep close to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of him in his kingdom, the Apostle answers, <hi>v. 27.
And this word, yet once more, signifies the removing of those things
that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which
cannot be shaken may remain.</hi> And thus am I stepped down
upon the words of my Text, finding them in the close of
the Arguments drawn from the power of Christ, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
professors to constancy in the paths of the Gospel;
and having passed through their coherence, and held out
their ayme and tendance, their opening and Application
comes now to be considered: and herein these 3. things.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The Apostles</hi> Assertion, The things that are shaken shall be
removed, as things that are made.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The</hi> proof <hi>of this Assertion,</hi> This word, once more, signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<hi>no lesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. His <hi>Inference</hi> from this Assertion, thus proved: <hi>The
things that cannot be shaken must remain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the first I shall consider,</p>
            <p>1. What are the things that are <hi>shaken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. What is their shaking.</p>
            <p>3. What their <hi>removall</hi> being shaken.</p>
            <p>For the first, there is great variety of judgement amongst
Interpreters; the fore-going verse tells us it is not onely
the Earth,<note place="margin">Nescio an faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior hic locus fuisset, si nemo cum opposu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isset. Mald: ad Luc. 2. v 34.</note> but the Heaven also; but now what <hi>Heaven</hi> and
<hi>Earth</hi> this should be, is dubious, is not apparent. So many
different apprehensions of the minde of God in these
words, as have any likenesse of truth, I must needs recount
and remove, that no prejudice may remain from other
conceptions, against that which from them we shall assert.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Earth</hi> (say some) is the men of the Earth, living
thereon: and the Heavens are the Angels, their blessed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants:
both shaken, or stricken with amazement upon
the nativity of Christ, and preaching of the Gospel. The
<hi>heavens</hi> were shaken, when so great things were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55671:6"/>
as that the <hi>Angels themselves desired to look intt hem.</hi>
1 Pet. 1. 12. And the <hi>Earth</hi> was filled with amazement
when the holy Ghost being powred out upon the Apostles
for the preaching of the Gospel, men of every Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Heaven were amazed, and marvelled at it. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 5, 6, 7.
Thus <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

But,</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>shaking</hi> here intimated by the Apostle, was then
when he wrote under the Promise, not actually accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
as were the things by them recounted: for the holds
it forth as an issue of that great Power of Christ which he
would one day exercise for the further establishment of his
kingdom.</p>
            <p>2. This, that now is to be done, must excell that which
formerly was done at the giving of the Law, as is clearly
intimated in the inference, <hi>Then he sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k the Earth, but now
the Heavens also,</hi> (it is a gradation to an higher demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the power of Christ) which that the things of this
interpretation are, is not apparent.</p>
            <p>3. It is marvellous these learned men observed not, that
the <hi>Heavens and Earth shaken,</hi> v.<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 10. <gap reason="foreign">

the <hi>shaken things</hi> to be <hi>Judaic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

had said to be <hi>men and Angels.</hi>

            <p>2. Others by <hi>heaven</hi> and <hi>earth</hi> understand the materiall
parts of the worlds fabrick, commonly so called: and by
their <hi>shaking,</hi> those portentous signes and prodigies, with
Earthquakes, which appeared in them, at the birth, and
death of the Lord Jesus.<note place="margin">Matth 2. 2.</note> A new Star, preternaturall dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

with the former,<note place="margin">

2. How are these <hi>shaken</hi> things <hi>removed,</hi> which with their
shaking they must certainly be, as in my Text?</p>
            <p>3. This shaking of Heaven and Earth is ascribed to the
power of Christ as Mediator, whereunto these signes and
prodigies cannot rationally be assigned, but rather to the
soveraignty of the Father bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing witnesse to the Nativity
and death of his Son: so that neither can this conception
be fastned on the words.</p>
            <p>3. The fabrick of Heaven and Earth is by others also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
not in respect of the signes and prodigies formerly
wrought in them; but of that dissolution, or as they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Alteration, which they shall receive at the last day:
So <hi>Paraeus Grotius,</hi> many more. Now though these avoid
the Rock of holding out as accomplished what is onely
promised, yet this Glosse also is a dresse disfiguring the
minde of God in the Text. For,</p>
            <p>1. The things here said to be <hi>shaken,</hi> do stand in a plain
opposition to the things that <hi>cannot be shaken,</hi> nor <hi>removed;</hi>
and therefore they are to be removed, that these may be
brought in. Now the things to be brought in are the things
of the <hi>kingdom</hi> of the Lord Jesus: what opposition, I pray,
do the materiall fabrick of Heaven and Earth stand in to
the kingdom of the Lord Jesus? doubtlesse none at all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the proper seat of that kingdom.</p>
            <p>2. There will on this ground, be no bringing in of the
kingdom of the Lord Jesus, untill indeed that kingdom in
the sense here insisted on is to cease, that is after the <hi>day of
judgement,</hi> when the kingdom of Grace shall have place no
more.</p>
            <p>Those are the most materiall and likely mistakes about
the words; I could easily give out, and pluck in again 3.
or 4. other warping senses, but I hope few in these dayes
of <hi>accomplishing</hi> will once stumble at them; The true minde
of the Spirit, by the help of that Spirit of truth comes next
to be unfolded. And first what are the things that are
shaken.</p>
            <p>1. As the Apostle here applyes a part of the Prophesie
of <hi>Haggai,</hi> so that Prophesie even in the next words gives
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55671:7"/>
light into the meaning of the Apostle. Look what <hi>Heaven</hi>
and <hi>Earth</hi> the Prophet speaks of,<note place="margin">Nunquam Pauli sensum ingredieris, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si Pauli Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum imbiberis: Ber: ser. de Monte.</note> of those and no other
speaks the Apostle. The Spirit of God in the Scripture is
his own best interpreter. See then the order of the words
as they lye in the Prophet. <hi>Hagg. 2. 6, 7. I will shake heaven
and earth: I will shake all Nations.</hi> God then shakes <hi>Heaven
and Earth,</hi> when he shakes <hi>all Nations:</hi> that is, he shakes the
<hi>Heaven and Earth of the Nations.</hi>

the Heaven and Earth of all Nations.</hi> These are the things
shaken in my Text.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Heavens of the Nations</hi> what are they? even their <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
heights</hi> and glory, those Forms of Government which
they have framed for themselves and their own interest:
with the grandeur and lustre of their Dominions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nations Earth</hi> is the multitudes of their people, their
strength and power, whereby their <hi>Heavens</hi> or politicall
heights are supported.</p>
            <p>It is then neither the materiall Heavens and Earth, nor
yet Mosaicall Ordinances, but the Politicall Heights and
splendour, the popular multitudes and strength of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Earth, that are thus to be shaken, as shall be
proved.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Earth</hi> in propheticall descriptions or predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of things, is frequently, yea almost alwayes taken for
the people and multitudes of the Earth, needs not much
proving.<note place="margin">Psal 68. 9.</note> One or two instances shall suffice. <hi>Revel. 12. 16.

            <p>And for the <hi>Heavens,</hi> whether they be the Politicall
heights of the Nations, or the grandeur of Potentates, let
the Scripture be judge; I mean when used in this sense of
shaking, or establishment.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55671:8"/>
whose waves roared: the Lord of hosts is his name. And I have put
my words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of
mine hand, that I may plant the Heavens, and lay the foundations
of the Earth, and say unto Sion, Thou art my people.</p>
            <p>By a repetition of what he <hi>hath</hi> done, he establisheth his
people in expectation of what, 1. he <hi>will</hi> do. And first he
minds them of that wonderfull deliverance from an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

preparing dry paths for them in the deep. <hi>I am the

What! of these materiall visible Heavens and Earth? 2460
yeers before at least, were they planted and established: it
is all but making of <hi>Zion a people,</hi> which before was scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

this grandour of words, being part of the shaking of

               <hi>Heaven and Earth</hi> in my Text.</p>
            <p>Adde lastly hereunto, that the Promises of the Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of God's people into a glorious condition after all
their sufferings, is perpetually in the Scripture held out
under the same terms; and you have a plentifull demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of this point.</p>
            <p>Isa.<note place="margin">Isa. 66. 22, 23, 24.</note> 65. 17. Behold, I create new Heavens, and a new Earth:
and the former shall not be remembred, nor come into my minde. <hi>v.</hi>
18. Be you glad and rejoyce for ever in that which I create, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 Pet. 3. 13. Neverthelesse we according to his promise, look for
new Heavens and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth righteousnesse.</p>
            <p>Revel. 21. 1. I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth, for the
first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away, and there was no
more Sea. <hi>The Heaven and Earth is restored, but the Sea
that shall be no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those gatherings together of many waters,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 10.</note> Rivers from
all places, or pretended Clergie men from all Nations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Generall Counsels,<note place="margin">Revel. 17. 1.</note> which were the <hi>Sea</hi> or <hi>many waters</hi>
on which the whore sate, shall have no place at all, in the
Churches restored condition.</p>
            <p>I hope it is now fully cleared, what is meant by the
things that are shaken: even the Politicall Heights, the
splendor and strength of the Nations of the Earth, the
foundation of the whole is laid,<note place="margin">Dimidium facti, &amp;c.</note> and our heap (or building
if your favour so accept it) will go on apace; for to the
<hi>Analogie</hi> hereof, shal the residue of the words be interpreted.</p>
            <p>The second thing considerable is,<note place="margin">Part: II.</note> what is the <hi>shaking</hi> of
these things? to this the Answer is now made brief and
facile. Such as are the <hi>things shaken,</hi> such must their shaking
be. Spirituall, if spirituall; naturall, if naturall; civill, if
civill.<note place="margin">Mat. 24 6, 7.</note> Now they being declared and proved to be <hi>civill</hi>
things,<note place="margin">Ier. 4. 19.</note> such also is their <hi>shaking.</hi> Now what is a civill sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of civill constitutions?<note place="margin">Isa. 9. 5.</note> How are such things done in
the world? what are these Earthquakes? truly the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
hereof is in all Nations so under our eyes, as
that I need not speak one word thereunto.</p>
            <p>Neither shall I insist upon the 3d Inquiry,<note place="margin">Part 3.</note> 
               <hi>viz: when</hi> this
<hi>shaking</hi> shall be? The Text is plain, that is must be previous

to the bringing in of those things that cannot be moved:<note place="margin">

that is the prosperous estate of the kingdom of Christ. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Opposition,<note place="margin">Matth. 24. 7.</note> which the kingdom of Christ hath met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
in the world.</p>
            <p>First from the <hi>Pagan Romane State,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> which at the Gospel's
first entrance held in subjection most of the chief Provinces
of the then known world. What were the bloody endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of the <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> of that State for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
thereof is known to our children: The issue of the
whole in the accomplishment of this promise,<note place="margin">Luk. 2. 1.</note> shaking
those <hi>Heavens and Earth</hi> to pieces, I before pointed at from
<hi>Revel.</hi> 6. 12, 13, 14, 15. beginning in the plagues of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting
<hi>Emperors,</hi> and ending in the ruine of the Empire it
self. But,</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>unmoveable things</hi> were not yet in their glory to
be brought in. More seed of blood must be sown, that the
End of the Gospels yeer may yeeld a plentifull Harvest.
That <hi>shaking</hi> was onely for Vengeance upon an old cursed,
and not for the bringing in of a new blessed State. The
<hi>vials</hi> of Gods wrath having crumbled the Heavens and
Earth of <hi>Pagan Rome</hi> into severall pieces,<note place="margin">

                  </gap> 2 Thes. 2. 6.</note> and that Empire
being removed as to its old form, by the craft of Satan it
became moulded up again into a Papall Soveraignty, to
exercise <hi>all the power of the first Beast,</hi> in persecution of the
Saints. <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 12. This second pressure though long and
sore must have an end; the new moulded <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi>
of <hi>Papall</hi> Antichristian <hi>Rome,</hi> running by a mysterious
threed, through all the Nations of the West, must be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
also:<note place="margin">Revel. 18. 2.</note> which when it is accomplished there shall be no
more Sea.<note place="margin">Isa 60. 12.</note> There is not another Beast to arise, nor another
State to be formed;<note place="margin">Psal. 2. 6.</note> let indeavours be what they will, the
Lord Jesus shall reign. And this for opening of the first ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
head.<note place="margin">II Generall Head.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, what is the <hi>Removall of Heaven and Earth being
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55671:10"/>
shaken:</hi> The word here translated <hi>removall,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
whence that is come to passe, I dare not positively say.
This doubtlesse is a common fault amongst Translators,
that they will accommodate the words of a Text, to their
own apprehension of the sense and matter thereof.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 5.</note> Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
as I suppose,<note place="margin">Iude 4.</note> that the things here said to be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
were the Jewish ordinances,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 6.</note> they translated their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 18.</note>
a <hi>Removall;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 12.</note> as the truth is they were removed.
But the word signifies no such thing. As it's naturall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
from it's rise and composition is otherwise, so
neither in the Scripture or any profane Author, doth it
ever signifie properly a <hi>removall.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mutationem: Trem: Transla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tionem Erasm. Ar: Mont.</note> 
               <hi>Translation,</hi> or changing, is
the onely native, genuine import of it: and why it should
in this place be haled out of it's own sphere, and tortured
into a new signification, I know not. <hi>Removall</hi> is of the
matter, <hi>Translation</hi> of the form onely. It is not then a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and totall amotion, of the great things of the
Nations, but a change, translation and new moulding of
them, that is here intimated. They shall be shuffled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
almost into their primitive confusion, and come out
new moulded for the interest of the Lord Jesus. All the
present States of the world, are cemented together by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian
lime, as I shall shew afterwards: unlesse they be
so shaken as to have every cranny searched and brushed,
they will be no quiet habitation for the Lord Christ, and
his people. This then is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the <hi>Heaven and earth</hi>
of the Nations.</p>
            <p>Now this is evident, from that full prediction which
you have of the accomplishment hereof, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 12, 13,
and 16.</p>
            <p>Ver: 12. the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of the West receive <hi>power at one
houre with the Beast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ver. 13. in their constitution and government at first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<hi>They give their Power to the Beast, and fight against the
Lambe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ver: 14. the</hi> Lambe with his faithfull and chosen ones, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
them. <hi>There, their</hi> Heaven <hi>and</hi> Earth <hi>is shaken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ver. 16. Their Power is translated, new moulded, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55671:10"/>
becomes <hi>a power against the Beast, in the hand of Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then is the <hi>shaking</hi> and <hi>removall,</hi> in my Text: which
is said to be, <hi>as of things that are made:</hi> that is, by men,
through the concurrence of divine providence for a season
(which making you have, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 12: and 17.) not like
the kingdom of Christ, which being of a purely divine
constitution, shall by no humane power receive an End.</p>
            <p>The other parts of the Text follow briefly.</p>
            <p>The next thing is the Apostles proof of this Assertion.
And he tels you, this, once more, the beginning of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
he urged from the Prophet signifies no lesse. The
words in the Prophet are, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>yet once, it
is a little,</hi> meghat hi <hi>it is a little,</hi> is left out by the Apostle, as
not conducing to the businesse in hand. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (as he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
hod achath) are a sufficient demonstration of the
assertion. In themselves they hold out a commutation of
things, and as they stand in conjunction in that place of
the Prophet, declaring that that <hi>shaking</hi> and commutation
must be for the bringing in of the kingdom of the Lord
Christ. In brief, being interpreted, by the same Spirit
whereby they were indited, we know the exposition is true.</p>
            <p>The last Head remaineth under two particulars.</p>
            <p>1. What are the things that cannot be shaken.</p>
            <p>2. What is their remaining.</p>
            <p>For the first, the <hi>things that cannot be shaken,</hi> v. 24. are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a <hi>kingdom that cannot be removed,</hi> v. 28. A kingdom sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to none of those shakings and alterations,<note place="margin">Psal. 2. 6.</note> which other
Dominions have been tossed to and fro with all.<note place="margin">Psal. 110. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Daniel</hi> cals
it,<note place="margin">Acts 2. 36.</note> 
               <hi>A not giving of the kingdom to another people.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 1. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44. not
that oecumenicall kingdom which he hath with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 24. 25, 26, 27.</note>
as King of Nations, but that oeconomicall kingdom
which he hath by dispensation from his Father, as King of
Saints. Now this may be considered two wayes:</p>
            <p>1. As purely internall and spirituall, which is the rule
of his Spirit in the hearts of all his Saints;<note place="margin">Luk 6. 20.</note> this cometh not
with observation,<note place="margin">Mark. 12. 34. &amp;c.</note> it is within us. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 20, 21. consisting
in righteousnesse, peace, and joy in the holy Ghost. <hi>Rom.</hi>
14. 17.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:55671:11"/>
2.<note place="margin">Psal. 45. 6.</note> As externall, and appearing in Gospel Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
so is Christ described as a King in the midst of their
kingdom,<note place="margin">Psal. 145. 13.</note>

               <note place="margin">Isa. 9. 7.</note> 1. 14, 15, 16, 17. as also Chap. 4. as also
Chap.<note place="margin">Obad. 21.</note> 11. 15. And both these may be again considered 2.
wayes.</p>
            <p>1. In respect of their essence and being, and so they
have been, are, and shall be continued in all Ages: He <hi>hath
built his Church upon a Rock, and the gates of Hell shall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
against it.</hi> Matth. 16. 18.</p>
            <p>2.<note place="margin">Isa. 11. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> In reference to their extent in respect of Subjects, with
their visible glorious appearance, which is under innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
promises to be very great in the latter dayes.<note place="margin">Chap. 18. 18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>For it
shall come to passe in the last dayes, that the mountain of the Lords
house shall be established in the top of the mountains,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 30. 18, 19.</note>

            </p>
            <p>These then are the things which cannot be shaken, which
we may reduce to 3. heads.</p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">Isa. 49. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.</note> The growth of righteousnesse, peace and joy in the

            <p>For the Personall Reign of the Lord Jesus on Earth,<note place="margin">Acts 3. 21.</note> I
leave it to them, with whose discoveries I am not, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosities
I would not be acquainted.</p>
            <p>But as for such, who from hence do, (or for sinister ends
pretend to) fancy to themselves a terrene kingly State,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55671:11"/>
unto each private particular Saint, so making it a bottome
<hi>vivendi ut velis,</hi> for every one to do that which is good in
his own eyes, to the disturbance of all order and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
civill and spirituall, as they expresly clash against in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
promises, so they directly introduce such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
and disorder, as the soul of the Lord Jesus doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
abhor.</p>
            <p>It is onely the three things named, with their necessarie
dependencies that I do assert.</p>
            <p>And lastly, of <hi>these</hi> it is said they must <hi>remain,</hi> that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
and be firmly established, as the word is often used:
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11.</p>
            <p>The words of the Text, being unfolded, and the minde
of the holy Ghost in them discovered, I shall from them
commend to your Christian consideration this following
Position.</p>
            <p>The Lord Jesus Christ by his mighty Power,<note place="margin">Obs:</note> in these latter daies,
as Antichristian Tyranny draws to it's period, will so farre shake
and translate the politicall Heights, Governments, and strength of
the Nations, as shall serve for the full bringing in of his own peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
kingdom; the Nations so shaken, becoming thereby a quiet Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
for the people of the most high.</p>
            <p>Though the Doctrine be clear from the Text, yet it shall
receive further Scripturall confirmation, being of great
weight and concernment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 44. And in the dayes of these kings shall the God of
heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the
kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces,
and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</p>
            <p>That this is affirmed of the kingdom of Christ under
the Gospel, none ever doubted.</p>
            <p>Three things are here remarkably intimated of it:</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>time</hi> wherein it shall most eminently be establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
and that is in the dayes of these kings, of which <hi>Daniel</hi>
was speaking.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The</hi> efficacy <hi>of it being set up,</hi> it shall break in pieces all
these kingdoms.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Its own</hi> stability, it shall never be destroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:55671:12"/>
For the first, there is great debate, about the principall
season of the accomplishing of this prediction: much hesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
who those Kings are in whose dayes the kingdom of
Christ is eminently to be established. In the dayes when
the two legs of the Romane Empire shall be divided into
ten Kingdoms, and those kingdoms have opposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the power of Christ, that is in the dayes
wherein we live, say some. Yea most of the Ancients took
this for the Romane Empire: and to these the bringing in
of the kingdom of Christ, is the establishment of it in these
dayes: Others understand the Syrian and Aegyptian bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the Grecian Monarchy, and the bringing in of
Christs kingdom, to be in his birth, death, and preaching
of the Gospel, wherein certainly the foundations of it were
layed: I will not contend with any mortall hereabouts.
Onely I shall oppose one or two things to this latter inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation:
as,</p>
            <p>1. The kingdom of Syria was totally destroyed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into a Romane Province 60. yeers before the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of Christ: and the Aegyptian 30. So that it is impossible
that the kingdom of Christ by his birth should be set up in
their dayes.</p>
            <p>2. It is ascribed to the efficacy of this Kingdom that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
established, it shall break in pieces all those kingdoms:
which how it can be, when at the first setting of it up, they
had neither place, nor name, nor scarce remembrance.</p>
            <p>So that it must needs be the declining divided Romane
Empire, shared amongst sundry Nations, that is here inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated:
and so consequently the kingdom of Christ to be

in these dayes, their dayes, he will bring in.</p>
            <p>Be it so, or otherwise, this from hence cannot be denyed,
That the kingdom of Christ, wil assuredly shake and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
all opposing Dominions, untill it self be established in
and over them all, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is all I intend to
prove from this place. The ten-partite Empire of the West,
must give place to the stone cut out of the mountain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 27. The Kingdom, and Dominion, and Greatnesse of
the Kingdom under the whole Heaven, shall be given to the people
of the Saints of the most High: whose kingdom is an everlasting
kingdom, and all Dominions shall serve and obey him. Hitherto is
the end of the matter.</p>
            <p>Either Antichrist is described in the close of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or one very like him, St. <hi>John</hi> painting him in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi>
with all this mans colours. Plainly intimating, that
though in the first place, that mad raging Tyrant <hi>Antiochus
the Illustrious</hi> was pointed at, yet that another was to rise
in his likenesse, with his craft and cruelty, that with the
assistance of the ten Horns, should plague the Saints of the
<hi>Christians,</hi> no lesse then the other had done those of the
<hi>Jews.</hi> Now what shall be the issue thereof? <hi>v. 26. His Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion

Or they shall enjoy the kingdom of Christ in a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
manner; their officers being made Peace, and their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actors

            <p>It is clearly evident from these and other places in that
Prophesie, that he who is the onely Potentate, will sooner
or later shake all the <hi>Monarchies</hi> of the Earth, where he
will have his Name known, that all Nations may be suited
to the interest of his kingdom, which alone is to endure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Isa.</hi> 60. in many places, indeed throughout holds out the
same.</p>
            <p>V. 12. <hi>The Nation and Kingdom which will not serve thee, shall
be broken to pieces:</hi> that is, all the Nations of the Earth, not a
<hi>known Nation,</hi> but the blood of the Saints of Christ is found
in the skirts thereof. Now what shall be the issue when they
are so broken:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>V.</hi> 17, 18. I will make thine officers Peace, and thine exactors
Righteousnesse: Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting
nor destruction within thy borders, but thou shalt call thy wals sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and thy gates praise.</p>
            <p>See at your leisure to this purpose: <hi>Amos 9. 11, 12, 13, 14,
15. Jerem. 31. 23, 24, 25. Isa.</hi> 33. 21, 22, 23, 24.</p>
            <p>I shall onely adde that punctuall description which you
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55671:13"/>
have of this <hi>whole matter</hi> as <hi>Daniel</hi> cals it in the Revelation,
with respect unto it's accomplishment. Chap. 17. the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Harlot, having procured the ten Kings or kingdoms,
into which the last head of the Romane Empire sprouted
about the yeer 450. by the inundation of the Northern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to joyn with her, they together make war against the
Lambe: <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>12. <hi>The ten Horns which thou sawest</hi> (upon the last head of
the great Beast the Romane Monarchy) <hi>are ten kings, which
have received no kingdoms as yet,</hi> (to wit, when <hi>John</hi> saw the
vision) <hi>but receive power as Kings one houre with the Beast</hi> (about
400. yeers after this, the Pope ascending to his Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and these Western Nations growing into distinct Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
about the same time.)</p>
            <p>13. <hi>These have one minde</hi> (that is as to the businesse in
hand, for otherwise they did and do vex one another with
perpetuall broyls and wars) <hi>and shall give their power and
strength to the Beast</hi> (or swear to defend the Rights of holy
Church, which is no other then Babylon, and act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly).</p>
            <p>14. <hi>These make warre with the Lambe,</hi> (having sworn and
undertaken the defence of holy Church, or Babylon, they
persecuted the poore hereticks with fire and sword, that is
the witnesses of the Lambe, and in them the Lambe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
striving to keep his kingdom out of the world) <hi>and the
Lambe shall overcome them,</hi> shaking and translating them into
a new mould and frame) <hi>For he is Lord of lords, and King of
kings, and they that are with him</hi> (whose help and endeavours
he will use) <hi>are called, and chosen, and faithfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>16. <hi>The ten Horns which thou sawest upon the Beast,</hi> (being
now shaken, changed and translated in minde, interest, and
perhaps Government) <hi>these hate the whore, and shall make her
desolate,</hi> (are instrumentall in the hand of Christ for the ruin
of that Antichristian State, which before they served) <hi>and
naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence Chap. 18. 2. Babylon, and that whole Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
State, which was supported upon their power and
greatnesse, having lost it's props, comes topling down to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55671:13"/>
the ground; <hi>Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen:</hi> v. 2. and the
Saints take vengeance on the whore for all her former rage
and crueltie. <hi>Double unto her double according to her works.</hi> v. 6.</p>
            <p>V. 9. <hi>And the Kings of the Earth</hi> (being some of them shaken
out of their dominion for refusing to close with the Lamb)
<hi>who have committed fornication, and lived deliciously with her</hi>
(learning &amp; practising false worship of her institution) <hi>shall
bewail her, and lament for her,</hi> (as having received succour
from her, her monstaries and shavelings, in their distresse,
whereunto indeed they were brought for her sake) <hi>when
they shall see the smoke of her burning,</hi> (beholding her darknesse,
stink and confusion, in her finall desolation.)</p>
            <p>Now all this shall be transacted with so much obscurity
and darknesse, Christ not openly appearing unto carnall
eyes, that, though <hi>many shall be purified and made white, yet
the wicked shall do wickedly, and none of the wicked shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
but the wise shall understand.</hi> Dan. 12. 10. there shall be
no such demonstration of the presence of Christ, as to open
the eyes of hardned men: but at length having suffered the
poore deceived wretches to drink of the cup prepared for
them, he appears himself gloriously, Chap. 19. 13. in a
more eminent manner then ever before, to the totall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the residue of opposers. And that this will be
the utmost close of that dispensation wherin now he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
I no way doubt.</p>
            <p>The Assertion being cleared and proved, the Reasons
of it come next to be considered: and the first is, that</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It shall be done by the way of Recompence and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</hi>

And do not the Kings of all these Nations as yet
stand up in the roome of their Progenitors with the same
implacable enmity to the power of the Gospel? Shew me
seven Kings that ever yet laboured sincerely to enhance the
kingdom of the Lord Jesus, and I dare boldly say, <hi>Octavus
quis fuerit nondum constat.</hi> And is there not a cry for all this,
<hi>How long, Lord, holy and true, doest thou not avenge our blood on
them that live on the earth?</hi> Revel. 6. 10. Doth not Sion cry,
<hi>The violence done to me and my flesh, be upon Babylon, and my blood
upon those Heavens</hi> of the Nations? And <hi>will not the Lord
avenge his Elect that cry unto him day and night, will he not do it
speedily? Will he not call the fowls of Heaven to eat the flesh of
Kings, and Captains, and great men of the Earth?</hi> Revel. 19. 18.
Will he not make these <hi>Heavens</hi> like the <hi>wood of the vine,</hi> not

            <p>The time shall come, wherein the <hi>Earth</hi> shall disclose her

            <p>For the present, the Government of the Nations, (as
many of them as are concerned therein) is purely framed
for the interest of Antichrist. No kinde of Government in
Europe, or line of Governors so ancient, but that the <hi>Beast</hi>
is as old as they, and had a great influence into their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
or establishment, to provide that it might be for
his own Interest.</p>
            <p>I beleeve it will be found a difficult task, to name any of
the kingdoms of Europe (excepting onely that remotest
Northward) in the setting up, and establishment whereof,
either as to persons or Government, the Pope hath not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
bargained for his own Interest, and provided, that
that should have the chiefest place in all the oaths and

               </gap>ions, and into
both of them what an influence the Pope had, is easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable.</p>
            <p>The first was between the yeers 4. and 500.<note place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 6, 7</note> after Christ,
when the Romane Empire of the West, that which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55671:15"/>
the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> from acting his part to the life,<note place="margin">Dan. 2. 41.</note> was
shivered to pieces by many barbarous Nations: who set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
themselves in the fruitfull soiles of <hi>Europe,</hi> began to

growing up into civill States: for the most part appointing

            <p>This furious inundation setled the <hi>Franches</hi> in <hi>Gall:</hi> the
<hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>West Goths</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> the <hi>East Goths</hi>

from some whereof, though for divers yeers the Papall
world was exceedingly tormented, and <hi>Rome</hi> it self sacked,
yet in the close and making up of their Governments,
changing their manners and Religion, they all submitted
to the usurpation of the Man of Sin; so that in all their
windings up there was a salve for him and his Authority.<note place="margin">Rev. 17. 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The second Great Alteration took up a long space, and
was in action about 300. years, reckoning it from the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
of the French Crown, from <hi>Childerick</hi> the 4th, unto
<hi>Pipin</hi> and his Son <hi>Charles,</hi> by Papall Authority, unto the
Conquest of <hi>England</hi> by the <hi>Normanes,</hi> in which space the
line of <hi>Charles</hi> in <hi>France</hi> was again by the same Authority
and the power of <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> cut off: no State in <hi>Europe</hi> the
choise <hi>patrimony</hi> of the Beast, that did not receive a signall
alteration, in this space, nor was there any alteration, but
that the Pope had a hand in every one of them, and either
by pretended collations of Right, to pacifie the consciences
of blood-thirsty Potentates, in the undertaking and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
their unjust Conquests, or foolish <hi>mitred confirmations</hi>
of <hi>Sword purchases,</hi> he got them all framed to his own end
and purpose, which was to bring all these Nations into
subjection to his Babylonish usurpations, which their
Kings finding no way inconsistent with their own designes
did willingly promote, labouring to enforce all conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
into subjection to the <hi>Romane</hi> See.</p>
            <p>Hence it is,<note place="margin">Rev. 13. 15, 16.</note> as I observed before, that such an interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
was made of the Rights of holy Church, that is <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>
the mother of fornications, in all the Tyes, Oaths, and

            <p>This is a 2d.<note place="margin">Roma sedes Petri, quae Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storalis hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, facta caput mundo, quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid non possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det armis Rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligione tenet.

Power at the bringing in of his unmovable kingdom, <hi>will
shake the Heavens and the Earth of the Nations;</hi> even because in
their present constitution they are directly framed to the
interest of Antichrist, which by notable advantages at
their first moulding, and continued insinuations ever since,
hath so rivetted it self into the very fundamentals of them,
that no digging or mining, with an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> will cast
up the foundation stones thereof. The Lord Jesus then, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
promised the service of the Nations to his Church,
will so far open their whole frame to the roots, as to pluck
out all the cursed seeds of the <hi>mystery of Iniquity,</hi> which by
the craft of Satan, and exigencies of State, or methods of
advancing the pride and power of some sons of blood, have
been sown amongst them.</p>
            <p>Because as is their Interest,<note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> so is their Acting. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Power of the Nations stands in direct opposition to the
bringing in of the kingdom of Christ. Two things there
are which confessedly are incumbent on him in this day
of his advancement.</p>
            <p>1. The bringing home of his ancient people,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 16.</note> to be one
fold with the fulnesse of the Gentiles;<note place="margin">Isa. 37. 31.</note> raising up the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 30 9.</note> and building it as in dayes of old:<note place="margin">Ezek. 34. 23.</note> in the
accomplishment of innumerable promises,<note place="margin">Chap. 37. 24, 25.</note> and answer to
millions of Prayers, put up at the throne of grace, for this
very glory in all generations.<note place="margin">Hos. 3. 5.</note> Now there be two main hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances
of this work that must be removed:<note place="margin">Amos 9. 11.</note> the first wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Reall,</hi> the <hi>Great River Euphrates,</hi> the strength and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55671:16"/>
of whose streames doth yet rage so high, that there is
no passage for the Kings of the East to come over;<note place="margin">Exod. 14. 21, 22.</note> wherfore
this must be dryed up as other waters were for their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
in dayes of old.<note place="margin">Iosh. 3. 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 12. doubtlesse this is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in allusion to <hi>Abraham's</hi> coming over that River into
Canaan when the Church of God in his family was there
to be erected;<note place="margin">Hal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Passenger, to wit, over that River, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 13. and then it
may well enough denote the <hi>Turkish</hi> Power, which proud
as it is at this day, possessing in peace all those Regions of
the East, yet God can quickly make it wither, and be dried
up: or to the deliverance of the Jews from Babylon, when
it was taken and destroyed by the drying up of the streams
of that River, and so the yoke of her tyranny broken from
the Churches neck,<note place="margin">Ier. 51. 31, 32.</note> and so it can be no other but the power
of the Romish Babylon supported by the Kings of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which must therefore be shaken and dryed up.</p>
            <p>2. Morall: or the Idolatry of the Gentile worshippers.
The Jews stick hard as yet at this,<note place="margin">Revel 11. 2.</note> that God should abolish
any kinde of worship, which himself had once instituted:
But that he should ever accept any false worship, which he
had once strictly prohibited, and no where to this day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
to this they will never be reconciled. Now such is

            <p>
               <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 54, 55, 56. our Saviour gives it in as a sure testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> hypocrisie, notwithstanding all their
pretences, and possession of <hi>Moses</hi> Chair, that they were
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55671:17"/>
wise in earthly things, and had drawn out experiences by
long observation, of what was like to come to passe as to
the <hi>weather,</hi> by considering the ordinary signes of the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
thereof; but notwithstanding that mighty effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
concurrence of signes in heaven and earth, with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of Prophesies, all pointing to the instant
establishment of the kingdom of God in the coming of the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> not discerning them at all, they come and cry, <hi>If
thou be the Christ, give us a signe;</hi> when without satisfying
their sinfull curiosity, heaven and earth was full of signes
round about them.</p>
            <p>Men who wil not receive God's <hi>signes,</hi> suppose they should

corruption which makes them dis-beleeve Gods signes,
moves them to look after signes of their own.</p>
            <p>For this very thing then, were the Pharisees branded as
hypocrites, that having wisdom in naturall things; to cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
and prognosticate from necessary signes, yet in the
works of the Lord, though the signes which in his wisdom
he was pleased to give, were plentifull round about them,
yet they must have some of their own choosing. I pray God
none such be found in our dayes.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 32. it is said of the men of <hi>Issachar, that they
had understanding of the times to know what Israel ought to do.</hi>
Israel is in the dark, and knows not what to do, if the times
and seasons be not discovered to them.<note place="margin">Esther 1. 13.</note> If the minde and
will of the Lord in their generation, be not made out unto
a people, it will be their ruine.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that the Lord incourageth us to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
after these things, to finde out the seasons wherein
he will do any great work for his people, knowing that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55671:18"/>
without this, we shall be altogether uselesse in the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wherein we live.</p>
            <p>Isa. 45. 11. Ask of me of THINGS TO COME concerning
my sons, and concerning the works of my hands COMMAND you
me.</p>
            <p>And what is this, that the Lord will have his people to
inquire of him about? even the great work of the ruine of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> and restauration of his Church, which yet was not
to be accomplished for 240. yeers. And this he tells you
plainly in the following verses.</p>
            <p>I have raised him up (<hi>Cyrus</hi>) inrighteousnesse, I will direct his
wayes, he shall build my cities, and he shall let go my captives, not
for price, nor for reward, saith the Lord of hosts. <hi>v.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>The Lord is earnest with his people to inquire into the
season of the accomplishment of his great intendments for
the good of his Church, when as yet they are afar off, how
much more when they are nigh at hand, even at the doors.
<hi>Who so is wise, and will ponder these things, they shall understand
the loving kindnesse of the Lord.</hi> Psal. 107. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 2. The Prophet tels you, that this was his great
study, and at length he understood by books, the approach
of the time, wherein God would deliver his Church from
Babylonish captivity and pollution: now this discovery
hath two or three notable products.</p>
            <p>1. It puts him upon earnest supplications for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of their promised deliverance in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
season. Wide from that <hi>Atheisticall</hi> frame of spirit,
which would have a predetermination of events and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses,
to eradicate all care and endeavour to serve that
Providence, which will produce their Accomplishment. A
discovery of the approach of any promised, and before fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
work of God, should settle our minds to the utmost en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
of helping the decree bring forth.</p>
            <p>2. He finds great acceptation in this his addresse to the
Lord by supplications, for the establishing of that work
which he had discovered was nigh at hand: for,</p>
            <p>1. An Answer is returned him fully to his whole desire
in the midst of his supplications: <hi>v. 21. Whilest I was praying,
the man Gabriel came, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:55671:18"/>
2. The work which he had discovered to be approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
was instantly hastned and gone in hand withall: <hi>v. 23.
At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth.</hi>
Oh that God would stir up his Saints, in the spirit of <hi>Daniel,</hi>
to consider and understand by books, the time that he hath
appointed for the deliverance of his people, that fixing
their supplications for the speeding thereof, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
may come forth for it's full accomplishment.</p>
            <p>3. Having attained this, the Lord gives him fresh disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
<hi>new light</hi> of the time for the birth of the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
which he thought not of, prayed not for: <hi>Seventy weeks are
determined,</hi> &amp;c. 24. So delighted is the Lord with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's
diligent inquiry into his wayes, and walkings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, that thereupon he appears unto them, in the
revelation of his mind, beyond all that they did expect or
desire.</p>
            <p>Now all this have I spoken to stir you up unto that, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
at the entrance of this Use, you were exhorted: that
you would labour for that spirituall wisdom &amp; prudence,
which may acquaint your hearts, at least in some measure,
with the minde and will of God, concerning his work in
the generation wherein you live. And further to provoke
you hereunto, know that you cannot but wander, as in
many other, so especially in foure sinfull things:</p>
            <p>1. Sinfull cares.</p>
            <p>2. Sinfull fears.</p>
            <p>3. Sinfull follies.</p>
            <p>4. Sinfull negligence.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Sinfull cares.</hi> Anxious and dubious thoughts about
such things, as perhaps the Lord intends utterly to destroy,
or at least render uselesse. Had it not been the greatest folly
in the world,<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 13.</note> for <hi>Noah</hi> and his sons, when the <hi>flood</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
to sweep away the creatures from the face of
the Earth, to have been solicitous about flocks and herds,
that were speedily to be destroyed. Many mens thoughts,
at this day, do even devour them, about such things, as if
they <hi>knew the season,</hi> would be contemptible unto them.
Wouldest thou labour for <hi>honour,</hi> if thou knewest that God
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55671:19"/>
at <hi>this time,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 23. 9.</note> were labouring to lay all the <hi>Honour of the Earth
in the dust?</hi> Couldest thou set thy heart upon the increase of
<hi>Riches,</hi> wert thou acquainted, that God intends instantly
to make <hi>silver as stones,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kin. 10. 27.</note> 
               <hi>and cedars as sycamores,</hi> though not for
plenty, yet for value. Would men be so exceedingly solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
about this or that form of religion, this or that Power
to suppresse such, or such a perswasion, if they knew that the
Lord would suddenly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Hab. 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>fill the Earth with his knowledge as the
waters cover the Sea?</hi> Should our spirits sink for fear of this
or that persecutor or oppressor, were it discovered unto us
that in a short time <hi>nothing shall hurt or destroy in the whole
mountain of the Lord?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 65. 25.</note> Should we tremble at the force and
power of this or that growing <hi>Monarchy,</hi> giving it's power
to the <hi>Beast,</hi> had God revealed unto us, that he is going to
<hi>shake</hi> it untill it be <hi>translated?</hi> Certain it is, that the root of
all the sinfull cares which sometimes are ready to devour
the hearts of God's people, is this unacquaintednesse with
the work and minde of the Lord.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Sinfull fears;</hi> Luk. 21. 28. our Saviour having told his
disciples of wars, tumults, seditions, famines, earthquakes,
&amp;c. which were to come upon the Earth, bids them when
they see these things, to <hi>lift up their heads</hi> for joy. But how
should this be? rejoyce in the midst of so many evils and
troubles, in the most whereof they were to have a <hi>Benjamins
messe,</hi> a double portion? Yea, saith our Saviour, <hi>rejoyce,</hi> for I
have told you before, that <hi>then</hi> it is that your deliverance
and redemption draweth nigh. It is for them to shake and
tremble, who are in the dark, who know not what the
Lord is a doing. They may be at their <hi>wits end,</hi> who know
no <hi>other end</hi> of these things: but for you, who know the
mind of the Lord, what he intendeth and will effect by
these things, cast off all sinfull fears, and rejoyce in him <hi>who
cometh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongst us in these dayes, new troubles arise, wars, and
rumors of wars, appearances of famine, invasions, conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies,
revolts, treacheries, sword, blood, oh how do mens
faces wax pale, and their hearts dye within them? Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with <hi>David</hi> they could fly to the <hi>Philistines,</hi> and wind
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55671:19"/>
up their interest with them, whom God will destroy: every
new appearance of danger, shuffles them off from all their
comforts, all their confidence. Hence poore souls are put
upon doubling and shifting in the wayes of God, in such a
<hi>frame</hi> as God exceedingly abhors. They know not why
any mercy is given, nor to what end, and therefore are
afraid to own it, lest some sudden alteration should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and make it too hot for them to hold it: and all this
because they know not the minde of the Lord, nor the
judgement of their God; were they but acquainted with
it, so far as it is evidently revealed, they would quickly
see all things working together to the appointed end.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Sinfull follies.</hi> Toil and labour in vain, is of all follies
the greatest folly, like the <hi>Jews</hi> under <hi>Julian,</hi> building of
their Temple in the day, God casting it to the ground in
the night. When a man labours, toils, wearies and spends
himself, for the accomplishing of that, which shall never
come to passe, <hi>and that,</hi> which if he would but enquire, he
might know shall never come to passe, he cannot well
want the livery of a <hi>bruitish man.</hi> How many poore crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that think themselves wiser then <hi>Charchan,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
and all the children of the East, do spend and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
their dayes and time, in such wayes as this, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
night and day to set up, what God will pull
down, and what he hath said shall fall. <hi>Come on, let us deal
wisely,</hi> saith <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to his <hi>Egyptians, Exod.</hi> 1. 10. to root out
and destroy these <hi>Israelites:</hi> poore fool! is there any wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or counsell against the most high? I could give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
plenty in these daies, of men labouring in the dark,
not knowing what they are a doing, indeavouring with
all their strength to accomplish that, whereof the Lord
hath said, <hi>It shall not prosper:</hi> and all because they discern not
the season.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Sinfull negligence.</hi> You are no way able to do the
work of God in your <hi>generation.</hi> It is the commendation of
many Saints of God, that they were <hi>upright, and served the
will of God in their generation.</hi> Besides the generall duties of
the Covenant, incumbent on all the Saints at all seasons,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55671:20"/>
there are speciall works of Providence, which in sundry
generations the Lord effecteth, concerning which, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
his people should know his minde, and serve him in
them. Now can a servant do his masters work, if he know
not his will? The Lord requireth that in the great things
which he hath to accomplish in this generation, all <hi>his</hi>
should close with him. What is the reason that some stand
in the market place idle all the day? some work for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and then give over, they know not how to go a step
farther, but after a day, a week, a month, or yeer, are at a
stand? worse then all this, some counterwork the Lord
with all their strength? the most neglect the duty which
of them is required: what is the reason of all this? They
know in no measure what the Lord is doing, and what he
would have them apply themselves unto. The <hi>best</hi> almost,
live from hand to mouth, following present appearances,
to the great neglect of the work which the Lord would
have hastned amongst us: all this comes from the same
root.</p>
            <p>But now,<note place="margin">Qu.</note> if all these sad and sinfull consequences at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
this nescience of the minde of God, as to the things
which he is a doing, in the dayes wherein we live, so far
as he hath revealed himself, and requires us to observe his
walkings, by what wayes and means may we come to the
knowledge thereof, that we be not sinfully bewildred in
our own <hi>cares, fears,</hi> and <hi>follies,</hi> but that we may follow
hard after God, and be upright in our generation?</p>
            <p>There be foure things whereby we may come to have
an insight into the work which the Lord will do,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
in our dayes:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>By, the</hi> light which he gives.</p>
            <p>2. The previous works which he doth.</p>
            <p>3. The expectation of his Saints.</p>
            <p>4. The fear of his adversaries.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>By the light which he gives.</hi> God doth not use to set his
people to work in the dark; they are the <hi>children of light,</hi>
and they are no <hi>deeds of darknesse</hi> which they have to do.
How ever others are blinded, they shall see. Yea he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55671:20"/>
suits their light, to their labour, and gives them
a clear discerning of what he is about. <hi>The Lord God doth
nothing, but he reveals his secrets to his servants.</hi> The <hi>light</hi> of
every Age, is the forerunner of the <hi>work</hi> of every Age.</p>
            <p>When Christ was to come in the flesh, <hi>John Baptist</hi> comes
a little before. A new light, a new Preacher. And what
doth he discover and reveal? why he calls them off from
resting on legall Ceremonies, to the doctrine of Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and Gospel ordinances: tels them the kingdom
of God is at hand; instructs them in the knowledge of him
who was <hi>coming:</hi> to what end was all this? onely that the
minds of men being enlightned by his preaching, who
was a <hi>burning and a shining lamp,</hi> they might see what the
Lord was doing.</p>
            <p>Every <hi>Age</hi> hath it's peculiar <hi>work,</hi> hath it's peculiar <hi>light.</hi>
Now what is the light which God manifestly gives in, in
our dayes? surely not new doctrines, (as some pretend)
indeed old errors, and long since exploded fancies. Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the peculiar <hi>light</hi> of this generation, is that discovery
which the Lord hath made to his people, of the mystery
of Civill and Ecclesiasticall Tyranny. The opening, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravelling,
and revealing the Antichristian interest, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven,
and coupled together in civill, and spirituall
things, into a State opposite to the kingdom of the Lord
Jesus, is the great discovery of these dayes. Who almost
is there amongst us now, who doth not evidently see, that
for many generations, the Western Nations have been
Juggled into spirituall and civill slavery, by the legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
of the Whore, and the Potentates of the Earth, made
drunk with the cup of her Abominations? How the whole
Earth hath been rolled in confusion, and the Saints hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of the world, to give way to their combined interest?
Hath not God unvailed that Harlot, made her naked, and
discovered her abominable filthinesse? Is it not evident to
him that hath but half an eye, that the whole present
Constitution of the Governments of the Nations, is so
cemented with Antichristian morter from the very top to
the bottom, that without a <hi>through shaking</hi> they cannot be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55671:21"/>
cleansed? This then plainly discovers, that the work which
the Lord is a doing, relates to the untwining of this close
combination against himself, and the kingdom of his
dear Son, and he will not leave untill he have done it.</p>
            <p>To what degree in the severall Nations this <hi>shaking</hi> shall
proceed, I have nothing to determine in particular, the
Scripture having not expressed it. This onely is certain,
it shall not stop, nor receive it's period, before the interest
of Antichristianity be wholly separated from the power of
those Nations.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>By the previous works he doth.</hi> How many of these doth
our Saviour give, as signes of the destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
and so consequently of propagating the Gospel more and
more to the Nations: <hi>Matth. 24. Luk.</hi> 21. How fearfull and
dreadfull they were in their accomplishment, <hi>Josephus</hi> the
Jewish Historian relateth: and how by them the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were fore-warned, and did by them understand what
the Lord was a doing, <hi>Eusebius</hi> and others declare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When</hi> (saith he) <hi>you shall see the abdomination of desolation</hi>
(the Romane Eagles and Ensignes) <hi>standing in the holy
place,</hi> Matth. 24. 15. or, <hi>Jerusalem compassed with Armies,</hi> as
Luk. 21. 20. <hi>then know</hi> by that, that the end thereof is come,
and your deliverance at hand.</p>
            <p>The works of God are to be sought out of them that
have pleasure in them. They are vocall speaking works:
the minde of God is in them. They may be heard, read,
and understood; the <hi>Rod may be heard, and who hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it.</hi> Now generally he begins with lesser works to point
out to the sons of men, what he is about to accomplish. By
these may his will be known, that he may be met in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</p>
            <p>Now what, I pray, are the <hi>works</hi> that the Lord is bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth upon the Earth? what is he doing in our own
and the Neighbour Nations? Shew me the Potentate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Earth, that hath a peaceable Molehil, to build him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
an habitation upon? Are not all the controversies, or
the most of them, that at this day are disputed in letters
of blood, among the Nations, somewhat of a distinct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55671:21"/>
from those formerly under debate? those tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
meerly to the power and glendour of single persons,
these to the interest of the many. Is not the hand of the
Lord in all this? Are not the <hi>shakings</hi> of these <hi>Heavens</hi> of
the Nations from him? Is not the voice of Christ, in the
midst of all this tumult? And is not the genuine tendance
of these things, open the visible unto all?</p>
            <p>What speedy issue all this will be driven to, I know not:
so much is to be done as requires a long space. Though a
<hi>Tower</hi> may be pulled down faster then it was set up, yet
that which hath been building a <hi>thousand yeers,</hi> is not like
to go down in a <hi>thousand dayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The expectation of the <hi>Saints,</hi> is another thing, from
whence a discovery of the will of God, and the work of
our generation, may be concluded. The secret wayes of
God's communicating his minde unto his <hi>Saints,</hi> by a fresh
savour of accomplishing prophesies, and strong workings
of the Spirit of supplications, I cannot now insist upon.
This I know, they shall not be <hi>led into temptation,</hi> but kept
from the <hi>houre thereof,</hi> when it comes upon the whole earth.
When God raiseth up the expectation of his people to any
thing, he is not unto them <hi>as waters that fail.</hi> Nay he will
assuredly fulfill the desires of the poore.</p>
            <p>Just about the time,<note place="margin">Luk. 3. 15.</note> that our Saviour Christ was to be
born of a woman, how were all that waited for salvation
in Israel raised up to an high expectation of the kingdom
of God; such as that people never had before, and assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shall never have again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea famous was the waiting of
that season, through the whole <hi>Romane Empire.</hi> And the
<hi>Lord whom they sought, came to his Temple.</hi> Eminent was their
hope, and excellent was the accomplishment.</p>
            <p>Whether this will be made a Rule to others or no, I
know not: This I am assured, that being bottomed on Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and built up with Supplications, it is a ground for
them to rest upon. And here I dare appeal to all, who with
any diligence have enquired into the things of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Christ, that have any savour upon their spirits
of the accomplishment of Prophesies, and Promises, in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55671:22"/>
latter dayes, who count themselves concerned in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Gospel, whether this thing, of consuming the <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of iniquity,</hi> and vindicating the Churches of Christ,
into the liberties purchased for them by the Lord Jesus,
by the <hi>shaking and translating</hi> all opposing Heights and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
be not fully in their expectations. Onely the time is
in the hand of God; and the Rule of our actings with him,
is his revealed will.</p>
            <p>4. Whether the <hi>fears of his Adversaries,</hi> have not their
lines meeting in the same point, themselves can best deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.
The whole world was more or lesse dreaded at the
coming of Christ in the flesh. When also the signes of his
vengeance did first appear to the Pagan world, in calling
to an account for the blood of his Saints, the Kings and
Captains presently cry out, <hi>The great day of his wrath is come,
and who shall be able to stand?</hi> Revel. 6. 17.</p>
            <p>I am not of counsel to any of the Adherents to the Man
of Sin, or any of those who have given their Power unto
the Beast, I have not a key to the bosomes of the Enemies
of Christ; I am neither their Interpreter, nor do they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me to speak in their behalf, yet truly upon very many
probable grounds, I am fully perswaded, that were the
thoughts of their hearts disclosed, notwithstanding all
their glittering shews, dreadfull words, threatning expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
you should see them tremble, and dread this very
thing, that the whole world as now established will be
wrapped up in darknesse, at least untill that cursed Interest
which is set up against the Lord Jesus, be fully and wholly
<hi>shaken</hi> out from the Heavens and Earth of the Nations.</p>
            <p>And thus without leading you about by Chronologies
and computations, which yet have their use, (<hi>well to count
a number being wisdom indeed</hi>) I have a little discovered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you some <hi>Rules,</hi> wherby you may come to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the <hi>work</hi> of God in the dayes wherein we live, and
also, what that <hi>work</hi> is, which is our first <hi>Vse:</hi> The next
shall be for direction, to guide you what you ought to do,
when you know what is the work of your Generation.</p>
            <p>Be exhorted to prepare to meet the Lord,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> to make his
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55671:22"/>
way straight: and this I would presse distinctly.</p>
            <p>1. As to your Persons.</p>
            <p>2. As to your Employments.</p>
            <p>1. As to your <hi>Persons:</hi> Give the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> a Throne in
your hearts, or it will not be at all to your advantage, that
he hath a throne and kingdom in the world. Perhaps you
will see the plenty of it, but not taste one morsell. Take first
that which <hi>comes not by Observation,</hi> that <hi>which is within you,
which is righteousnesse, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost.</hi> Take
it in it's <hi>power,</hi> and you will be the better enabled to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it coming in it's <hi>glory. Seek first this kingdom of God, and
the righteousnesse thereof, and all these things shall be added unto
you.</hi> Oh that it were the will of God, to put an end to all
that <hi>pretended</hi> holinesse, <hi>hypocriticall</hi> Humiliation, <hi>self-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ested</hi>
Religion, that have been among us, whereby we have
flattered God with our lips, whilest our hearts have been
farre from him. Oh that it might be the glory of this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
above all the Assemblies of the world, that every
Ruler in it, might be a sincere Subject in the kingdom of the
Lord Jesus. Oh that it might suffice that we have had in
our Parliament, and among our Ministers, so much of the
<hi>form,</hi> and so little of the <hi>power</hi> of Godlinesse: that we have
called world Christ, and lust Christ, and self Christ, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indeed for them, when we pretended all for Christ.
Oh that I could nourish this one contention in your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Assembly, that you might strive who should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
in setting up the Lord Jesus in their hearts.</p>
            <p>You may be apt to think, that if you can carry on, and
compasse your purposes, then all your Enemies will be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly
disappointed: do but embrace the Lord Jesus in
his kingly power in your bosomes, and <hi>ipso facto</hi> all your
Enemies are everlastingly disappointed: you are the <hi>grains,</hi>
which in the sifting of the Nation, have been kept from
falling to the ground. Are you not the residue of all the
Chariots of <hi>England?</hi> Oh that in you might appear the
reality of the kingdom of the Lord Jesus, which hath been
so long pretended by others: that sound righteousnesse,
not a Pharisaicall rigid supercilious affectation, nor a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55671:23"/>
belief and comportment, the issue of novell fancies,
might be found upon your spirits; that you may be
thought meet to rejoyce with the Lord in his kingdom:
otherwise this day of the Lord which we have described,
however desired and longed after, will be <hi>dark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>esse to you,
and not light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. In reference to your great Employments, whereunto
the Lord hath called you, and here I shall briefly hold out
unto you one or two things.</p>
            <p>1. That you would seriously consider, why it is that
the Lord <hi>shakes</hi> the <hi>Heavens</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi> of the Nations,
to what <hi>end</hi> this tendeth, and what is the <hi>cause</hi> thereof. Is
it not from hence, that he may revenge their opposition
to the kingdom of his dear Son? that he may <hi>shake</hi> out of
the midst of them, all that Antichristian mortar, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
from their first <hi>chaos</hi> they have been cemented? that
so the kingdoms of the Earth, may become the kingdoms
of the Lord Jesus: Is not the controversie of <hi>Sion</hi> pleaded
with them? Are they not called to an account for the
transgression of that charge given to all Potentates, <hi>Touch
not mine Anointed?</hi> And what is the ayme of the Lord Jesus
herein, whose mighty voice shakes them? Is it not to frame
and form them for the interest of his own kingdom? that
he may fulfill the word he hath spoken to Sion, <hi>I will make
thine officers, Peace, and thine exactors Righteousnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Consider then (I pray) what you have in hand: wait
upon your King the Lord Christ, to know his minde. If
you lay any stone in the whole building, that advanceth
it self against his Scepter, he will <hi>shake</hi> all again: digge you
never so deep, build you never so high, it shall be shaken.
Nay, that there be no opposition will not suffice; He hath
given light enough to have all things framed for his own
advantage. The time is come, yea the full time is come,
that it should be so, and he expects it from you. Say not in
the first place, this, or that, suits the interest of <hi>England,</hi>
but look what suits the interest of Christ; and assure your
selves, that the true interest of any Nation, is wrapped up
therein. More of this in the Treatise annexed to my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
of <hi>Jan:</hi> 31.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:55671:23"/>
2. Be incouraged under all those perplexities and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
which you are, or may be wrapped in: lift up the
hands that hang down, and let the feeble knees be streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened:
<hi>I is but yet a little while, and he that shall come, will
come, and will not tarry.</hi> The more you are for Christ, the
more Enemies you shall be sure to have; but the Lambe
shall overcome. He is come to revenge the blood of his
slain upon this Generation, and to free the residue from
the jaws of the terrible. <hi>He is our Rock, and his work is perfect:</hi>
what he hath begun, faster, or flower, he will surely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish.</p>
            <p>It is a thing of the most imaginable indifferency, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any of our particular persons behold these things
here belowe or no: if otherwise, we shall for the present
have <hi>rest with him,</hi> and <hi>stand in our lot at the end of the dayes:</hi>
but for the work it self, the Decree is gone forth, and it
shall not be recalled; receive strength and refreshment in
the Lord.</p>
            <p>Wonder not when the <hi>Heaven</hi> is shaken;<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> if you see the
<hi>stars</hi> fall to the ground; we had some who pretended to be
<hi>Church-starres,</hi> that were meerly fixed to all mens view, and
by their own confession, in the <hi>Politicall Heavens.</hi> The first
shaking of this Nation, shook them utterly to the ground.
If others also tremble like an Aspen leaf, and know not
which winde to yeeld unto, or sail backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by the same gale, wonder not at that neither; when
men lay any other foundation then the immovable corner
stone, at one time or other, sooner or later, assuredly they
will be shaken.</p>
            <p>Let the professing people that is amongst us look well to
themselves:<note place="margin">Vse 4.</note> The day is coming that <hi>will burn like an oven.</hi>
Drosse will not endure this day; we have many an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
as yet to be uncased. Take heed you that act high, if a
false heart, a defiled heart be amongst you, there shall be
no place for it in the mountain of the Lords house. <hi>The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of Sion shall be all righteous:</hi> Isa. 60. 21. Many that
make a great shew now upon the stage, shall be turned off
with shame enough; try and search your hearts, force not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55671:24"/>
the Lord to lay you open to all. The <hi>Spirit of judgement and
burning</hi> will try you. Tremble, I pray, for you are entring
the most purging trying fornace, that ever the Lord <hi>set up</hi>
on the Earth.</p>
            <p>Be loose from all shaken things:<note place="margin">Vse 5.</note> you see the clouds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
after the rain: one storme in the neck of another. Thus
it must be, untill Christ hath finished his whole work. <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that all these things must be dissolved, what manner of persons
ought we to be in all manner of holy conversation.</hi> Let your eyes
be upwards, and your hearts be upwards, and your hands
be upwards, that you be not moved at the passing away of
shaken things. I could here incourage you by the glorious
issue of all these shakings, whose soretast might be as mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to your bones, though they should be appointed to
consumption before the accomplishment of it: but I must
close.</p>
            <p>See the vanity,<note place="margin">Vse 6.</note> folly, madnesse, of such as labour to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the bringing in the kingdom of the Lord Jesus. Canst
thou hinder the <hi>rain</hi> from descending upon the earth when
it is falling? Canst thou stop the <hi>Sun</hi> from rising at it's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
houre? will the <hi>conception</hi> for thee dwell quietly
in the wombe beyond it's month? Surely thou mayest with
far more ease turn and stop the current and course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
then obstruct the bringing in of the kingdome of
Christ, in righteousnesse and peace. Whence comes it to
passe, that so many Nations are wasted, destroyed, spoiled,
in the dayes wherein we live? that God hath taken quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and peace from the Earth? Doubtlesse from hence,
that they will smite themselves against the <hi>Stone cut out of
the mountain without hands.</hi> Shall not the Decree bring forth?
is it not in vain to fight against the Lord? Some are angry,
some troubled, some in the dark, some full of revenge, but
the truth is, whether they will hear or forbear, <hi>Babylon</hi>
shall fall, and all the glory of the Earth be stained, and the
kingdoms become the kingdoms of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
