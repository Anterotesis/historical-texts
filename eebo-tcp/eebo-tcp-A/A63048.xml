            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        </gap> all the world to the Roman Chair.</note> 
                     <hi>Appeals:</hi> which was the first step made by that irregular Chair, to the Exorbitant <hi>Supremacy</hi> which they afterward claimed. In vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating that Claim before the Council, they produced two counterfeit Canons, fathered upon the Oecumenical Synod at <hi>Nice;</hi> which were by the Records of <hi>Carthage, Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> in the presence of all those Fathers, in the sixth Council of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> detected to be forgeries, as well as by the Tenor of the undoubted Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the <hi>Nicene Council</hi> it self,
<pb facs="tcp:55872:4"/>
which are contrary to those by the <hi>Roman Church</hi> pretended; and so they were esteemed by the Fathers in that sixth Council, who were start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the sight of those New unheard of Monsters, at their first Publication, above 1200 years ago.</p>
                  <p>Vpon this Passage, I redoubled in the Book an observation (to make it more remarkable,) which you will find cap. 2. pag. 9. to this purpose, <hi>That in the first General Council of Nice it was ordered, that the chief in every Province should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Acts of his inferior Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops; And if any Trouble did arise which could not be decided by the Metropolitan, Provision was made</hi> Can. 5. <hi>(in words so clear and forcible, that none more plain can be put into their places) that the last Appeal should be made to Councils, and that the Person condemned in any Province should
<pb facs="tcp:55872:4"/>
not be received, if he fled to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> That Parenthesis <hi>(In words so clear and forcible, that none more plain can be put in their places)</hi> relates to the <hi>CANON</hi> it self: which here follows that you may see how forcible it is, and how much plainer then the very Words into which I had contracted it. It is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy your Consideration, as on of the most Important Records in Antiquity, consented to by all the Popish Compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Councils themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Can.</hi> 5. Concerning those that<note place="margin">This is the Canon oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Forgeries.</note> are Excommunicated, whether in the order of the Clergy or the Laitie, by the Bishops in every several province, let the Sentence prevail according to the Canon, that they who are cast out by some, be not received by others; But let it be required that no man be exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Congregation, by the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillanimitie, or contention, or any
<pb facs="tcp:55872:5"/>
such vice of the Bishop. That this therefore might more decently be inquired into, we think it fit, that Councils should every year throughout every Province twice be celebrated, that such Questions may be discussed by the Common Authority of all the Bishops assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together. And so they that have evidently offended against their Bishop, shall be accounted Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated according to reason, by all; till it pleaseth the Community of Bishops to pronounce a milder Sentence on such But let the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils be held, the one before the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aragesima</hi> before Easter, that all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention being taken away, we might offer a most pure Gift unto God: and the second about the middle of Autumn.</p>
                  <p>Had the Canon said, <hi>The last Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal shall be made to Councils,</hi> they that are accustomed to such shifts without
<pb facs="tcp:55872:5"/>
blushing, might easily have evaded the Words, by affirming the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be particularly excepted, without any need of expressing the exception; because by the general and Tacit Consent of all, he is above the Limits of such Laws, and above the Authority of that, and all other Councils. Thus they might still render the matter doubtful by their Subterfuges and Pretences; as indeed they do, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading one expression of the Canon it self. For whereas the Fathers say, <hi>Let the Sentence prevail according to the Canon, that they, who are cast out by some, be not received by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:</hi> Those Popish Hirelings make an exception of the <hi>Bishop of Rome,</hi> where the Oecumenical Synod maketh none: and might as well except him here, though the Council had said in terms, <hi>The last Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal shall be made to Councils.</hi> For the last Appeal to any subordinate Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, over which the Council had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Legislative Power, was ordered, they
<pb facs="tcp:55872:6"/>
might say to be made to Councils: But the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> being the Head of the Church, and having the supreme Authority over all Councils, was not thought of in this Canon: nor was fit he should be at all mentioned, because that would imply he was under their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. The <hi>Prodigious Height</hi> of their <hi>usurped Claim</hi> being their sole Defence, and their incredible <hi>Boldness</hi> the amazement of ignorant People, which is their chief security.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Council</hi> adding to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer expression this clause, <hi>That Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils should every year, throughout evry Province, twice be celebrated,</hi> (for this very end) <hi>that such Questions may be discussed by the common authority of all the Bishops assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together:</hi> it puts an end to the business: especially when they add, That <hi>they who have evidently offended their Bishop, shall be accounted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated according to reason,
<pb facs="tcp:55872:6"/>
till it pleaseth the community of Bishops to pronounce a milder Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</hi> But that which renders it most plain and forcible, is this, <hi>Let the Councils be held, the one before the</hi> Quadragesima <hi>before Easter, that all Dissention being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, we might offer a most pure Gift unto GOD. And the second a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of</hi> Autumn, All the wit in the world could not have inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a more clear and apparent <hi>provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> against the <hi>Roman Bishops</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd and impudent <hi>Pretences.</hi> No Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion (I think) can possibly be made there from; when it is once noted and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. For the Bar put in against the Pope, is not here in <hi>Words,</hi> but <hi>Things,</hi> It implies that the Controversie must <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Easter</hi> be fully determined: The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry end of calling such a Council, and holding it <hi>then,</hi> being <hi>the taking away of all dissention, that we might of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up a most pure Gift</hi> or Sacrifice <hi>to
<pb facs="tcp:55872:7"/>
God:</hi> that is, That Vnity being resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Church at <hi>that time,</hi> we might receive the <hi>Sacrament</hi> in Peace and Charity. Whereas, if after the Sentence of the <hi>Council,</hi> the business were to be carried to the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> Suits and Quarrels could not be ended against <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> but would be lengthened in many Provinces, beyond <hi>Easter;</hi> both by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the <hi>Seas</hi> and <hi>Regions,</hi> to be pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed over by old and Crazy Persons, such as the venerable Bishops were, before they could come from their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to the <hi>Roman Chair;</hi> and by those Prolatory delays they might find there, the matter being wholy referred to the Popes pleasure.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Variation</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> in the Book, made my <hi>Note</hi> on this place look too like the <hi>Text</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> it self; which for as much as it happened in a most <hi>weighty</hi> Place, I could not with a <hi>good Conscience</hi> let it pass, without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting the Pious Reader with the
<pb facs="tcp:55872:7"/>
same. Though the <hi>Letter</hi> of the Canon it self (to prevent mistakes) is faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly translated afterwards <hi>page 26,</hi> and <hi>27.</hi> Yet without giving this <hi>Gloss</hi> upon the <hi>Canon;</hi> which was the occasion of this Pramonition, because so necessary to a clear and full understanding of all the procedure.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Note</hi> is the more <hi>weighty,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Nicene Council</hi> is confessed on <hi>both sides,</hi> (by us for its own sake and its conformity to the Scriptures, by the Papists, for the <hi>Popes,</hi> that have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified it,) to be of <hi>great Authority;</hi> next to the <hi>Holy Bible,</hi> the very first, and most indisputable that is. Yet this <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> laid in the foundation, utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes all the following Pretences and Forgeries of the <hi>Roman Bishops.</hi> Which I beseech the Reader to examine more perfectly.

                  <p>Vincentius Lirinensis, <hi>another eminent Father, praised by</hi> Gennadius, <hi>died in the time of</hi> Theodosius <hi>and</hi> Valentinian. <hi>He wrote a Book</hi> against Heresies <hi>in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; wherein preparing Furniture and Instructions against their Wiles, he at first telleth us, that</hi> the Canon of the Scripture is alone sufficient: <hi>Then, that</hi> the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Fathers is to be taken in, for the more clear certainty of their sense and meaning. <hi>Upon this latter point he saith afterwards,</hi> But neither are all Heresies to
<pb facs="tcp:55872:9"/>
be assaulted this way, nor at all times, but<note place="margin">Vin. Lir. cap 39.</note> only such as are New and Green: to wit, when they first spring up, before they have falsified the Rules of the Ancient Faith, while they are hindered by straitness of time, and before (the Poyson spreading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad) they have endeavoured to corrupt the Writings of the Fathers. <hi>So that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks have inclination enough, where they are not</hi> hindered by straitness of time, <hi>to</hi> corrupt <hi>the most Ancient</hi> Writings <hi>of the Church: For which cause he further saith in the same place,</hi> But Heresies that <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> are spread abroad, and waxen old, must not be set upon in this sort, because by long continuance they have had opportunity to steal away the Truth. Whatsoever <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> nesses there be therefore, either of Schismes or Heresies that are grown Ancient, we <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  <p>In this Admonition the Father informs us of two things: First, that it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for <hi>Errour to prevail and spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad;</hi> to <hi>continue long,</hi> and <hi>wax old:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that having gotten possession of
<pb facs="tcp:55872:10"/>
Books and Libraries, it may <hi>falsisie the Rules of the Ancient Faith and steal away the Truth, by corrupting the Writings of the Fathers.</hi> In which case, he will not have the Controversie decided by the Fathers, but by the <hi>Scriptures only,</hi> or by old <hi>Vniversal Councils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if <hi>Errour</hi> proceed so far, as to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the <hi>Councils</hi> too, then of necessity we must have recourse to some other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; either to the <hi>Scriptures alone,</hi> as he directeth; or else we must detect the <hi>frauds,</hi> whereby the <hi>Councils</hi> themselves are <hi>falsified:</hi> For that they are liable to the same inconvenience, is evident, both by the paueity of Ancient Records, and the many Revolutions that have been in the World: especially since Nature teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth men to strike at the Root, attempts are more apt to be made upon <hi>them,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Hereticks are prone to be most bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie in undermining the <hi>Foundation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That it is possible for men so far to act against their Consciences, as to <hi>corrupt the Ancient Records of Truth,</hi> you see by the premises: and that it is an easie thing for them to effect it, that have gotten all kind of Books and Libraries into their hands, is apparent; because they that keep them, order them as they please:
<pb facs="tcp:55872:10"/>
So that if Hereticks be the Lords and Masters of them, for many Ages toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we may not rashly adventure our Salvation upon their <hi>own</hi> Records: All the World knows, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had all the Libraries of these <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern parts,</hi> for many Ages, in her power; &amp; that the <hi>Eastern parts</hi> are swallowed up by the Deluge of <hi>Mahumetanism:</hi> All that can seem harsh, is, that she that pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her self the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> should be guilty of <hi>Heresie.</hi> But if the property of <hi>falsifying the Fathers and Councils</hi> may pass for a Badge of <hi>Heresie,</hi> there will no greater <hi>Hereticks</hi> be found in the world, than those who stile themselves falsly <hi>Catholicks.</hi> For as the sight of the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of such a thing made <hi>Vincentius</hi> talk more like a <hi>Prophet</hi> than a <hi>Father,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath so behaved her self since his departure, as if she intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eminently to fulfil his Predictions: which will in the process of our Discourse be made evident to the pious and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reader.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Bernard</hi> lived to see the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that which <hi>Lirinensis</hi> feared; for he flourished in the Eleventh Age of the Church, when the Pope and his Chair were mounted up to the top of their
<pb facs="tcp:55872:11"/>
Height and Grandeur; and bearing an impartial Testimony, he wrote many things against their Enormities: The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their Popes, with those of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Orders and Degrees of men in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he inveyeth against at large, in his 33. Sermon upon the <hi>Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;</hi> smartly touching their <hi>Vain-glory, Pomp, Luxury, Avarice, Simony, Vsurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Incorrigibleness:</hi> so that for any <hi>Piety</hi> or <hi>Conscience</hi> in them, such <hi>frauds</hi> might easily be digested. He distinguishes the State of the Church into four several periods, or four different times; to each of which he annexeth one peculiar temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: <hi>Terrour</hi> in the <hi>Night</hi> of Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Errour</hi> in the <hi>Morning</hi> of her Peace, the heat of Lust, and the glaring splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of Riot and Excess, beautified with Riches, and varnished over with <hi>Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi> in the <hi>Noon</hi> of her prosperity, and the <hi>Guile of Deception</hi> in the <hi>Evening;</hi> where with great vehemence, and impatient<note place="margin">Ibid,</note>

<pb facs="tcp:55872:12"/>
and which he expresly noteth to be the immediate means of opening the way for Antichrist to appear. His words are very Poinant and Emphatical: <hi>it was bitter at first in the Death of Martyrs,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>

                  <p>Matters of Fact may be manifest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, where the means of contriving them remain unknown: a conjecture in a circumstance therefore destroys not the

Foundation. You will find other kinds of Arguments in the subsequent <hi>Epitome,</hi> than bare conjectures. In the mean time, be pleased to remember, that the Papists have had all kind of Books, nay, and Libraries in their hands; that the Roman Clergy (especially those that attend the Chair) have Glory, Wealth, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure enough to tempt them to such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours; that the Pope hath Power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to reward his <hi>Creatures,</hi> and that they have actually endeavoured to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt such Books by their <hi>Indices Expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorii,</hi> as also to put forth Apocryphal and Spurious Pieces; which Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> Dr. <hi>James,</hi> Bishop <hi>Jewel,</hi> and the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Crashaw,</hi> as well as the <hi>Indices</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, do evidently declare.

I desired him to name me <hi>One</hi> of his <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Millions of Martyrs,</hi> excepting those that died for Treason in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths,</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> his days: For the <hi>Martyrs of the Primitive times,</hi> were Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of the <hi>Catholick,</hi> but not of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:55872:15"/>
Church: They only being Martyrs of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> that die for <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi> the <hi>Popes Supremacy,</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Merits, Purgatory,</hi> and the like. So many he told me they had, but I could not get him to name one. As for his <hi>Councils, Antiquities,</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> I asked him what he would say, if I could clearly prove, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was guilty of <hi>forging</hi> them, so far, that they had published <hi>Canons</hi> in the <hi>Apostles</hi> names, and invented <hi>Councils</hi> that never were; forged <hi>Letters</hi> of Fathers, and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal Epistles,</hi> in the name of the first Bishops and Martyrs of <hi>Rome,</hi> made 5, 6, 700 years after they were dead, to the utter disguizing and defacing of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, for the first 400 years next after our Saviour? <hi>Tush, these are nothing but lyes,</hi> quoth he, <hi>whereby the protestants en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to disgrace the Papists.</hi> Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered I, you are a Scholar, and have heard of <hi>Isidore, Mercator, James Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, Peter Crabbe, Laurentius Surius, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verinus Binius, Labbè, Cossartius,</hi> and the <hi>Collectio Regia,</hi> Books of vast Bulk and Price, as well as of great Majesty and Magnificence: You met me this Evening at the <hi>Library door;</hi> if you please to meet me there tomorrow morning at eight of
<pb facs="tcp:55872:15"/>
the Clock, I will take you in; and we will go from Class to Class, from Book to Book, and there I will first shew in <hi>your own Authors,</hi> that you publish such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments for good <hi>Records;</hi> and then prove, that those <hi>Instruments</hi> are down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right frauds and <hi>forgeries,</hi> though cited by you upon all occasions. He would not come; but made this strange reply; <hi>What if they be Forgeries? what hurt is that to the Church of</hi> Rome? No! (cryed I, amazed) Is it no hurt to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> to be found guilty of <hi>forging Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> in the <hi>Apostles</hi> names, and <hi>Epistles</hi> in the <hi>Fathers</hi> names, which they never made? Is it nothing in <hi>Rome</hi> to be guilty of <hi>counterfeiting Decrees</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> and <hi>Records</hi> of <hi>Antiquity? I have done with you!</hi> whereupon I turned from him as an obdurate person. And with this I thought it meet to acquaint the Reader.</p>

                     <p>THe Sin of <hi>Forgery</hi> is fitter to be ranked with Adultery, Theft, Perjury, and Murder, than to be committed by <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Prelates:</hi> One <hi>Act</hi> of it is a Crime to be punished by the <hi>Judges;</hi> what then is a whole <hi>Life</hi> spent in many various and enormous Offences of that nature?</p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:55872:19"/>
                     <p>If a <hi>Beggar</hi> forge but a Pass, or a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, putting the Hands and Seals of two <hi>Justices of the Peace</hi> to it, he is whipt, or clapt into the Pillory, or marked for a <hi>Rogue,</hi> though he doth it only to satisfie his Hunger</p>
                     <p>If a Lease, a Bond, a Will, or a Deed of Gift be razed, or interlined by Craft, it passeth for a Cheat; but if the whole be counterfeited, the Crime is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>If an Instrument be forged in the <hi>Kings</hi> Name, or his Seal counterfeited, and put to any <hi>Patent,</hi> without his privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and consent, it is High Treason.</p>
                     <p>If any Records of Antiquity be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, or wilfully corrupted, relating to the benefit of men, it is like the Crying Sin of <hi>removing thy Neighbours Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> censures in the <hi>Proverbs.</hi> But if those Records appertain to the Right of Nations, the Peace of Mankind, or the Publick Welfare of the World, the Sin is of more mysterious and deeper nature.</p>
                     <p>If Counterfeits be shufled in among good Records, to the disorder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of the Authentick, and a <hi>Plea</hi> maintained by them, which without those Counterfeits would fall to the ground,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55872:19"/>
upon the deposition of False Witnesses; <hi>Theft</hi> and <hi>Perjury</hi> are effectually couched, together with <hi>Lying,</hi> in the Cheat.</p>
                     <p>If the Records so counterfeited con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Church, either in her Customs or Laws, her Lands, or the limits of her Jurisdiction, the Order of her Priests, or any other Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, besides other sins contained in it, there is superadded the Sin of <hi>Sacriledge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The highest degree of Forgery is that of altering the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> because the Majesty offended being Infinite, as well as the Concernment, the Crime is the more heincus.</p>
                     <p>The highest, next under that, is to counterfeit <hi>Rules</hi> in the Names of the <hi>Apostles, Oecumenical Councils,</hi> most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and Primitive <hi>Fathers,</hi> that is, to make <hi>Canons, letters, Books,</hi> and <hi>Decrees</hi> in their Names, of which they were not the Authors.</p>
                     <p>If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be guilty of this Crime, her <hi>Antiquity</hi> and <hi>Tradition,</hi> the two great <hi>Pillars</hi> upon which she standeth, are very <hi>rotten,</hi> and will moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into nothing.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Money</hi> be spent in promoting the Forgery, or any thing given, directly or indirectly, to its Fautors and Abettors,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55872:20"/>
in order to the Usurpation of any <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> Priviledge or Power; he that doth it, is guilty of <hi>Simony:</hi> And in many cases, Simony, Lying, and Sacriledge; are blended together.</p>
                     <p>Finally, If they that make the Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ather them upon GOD, or upon the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> the Sin of <hi>Blasphemy</hi> is added to Forgery; for it maketh God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lies; and being done <hi>maliciously,</hi> it draweth near to the unpardonable sin.</p>
                     <p>That some <hi>Popes</hi> have been guilty of <hi>Simony,</hi> cannot be doubted by them that are any thing versed in Church Antiqu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Hart,</hi> in his Conference with <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi>

                        </gap> out of Dr. <hi>Genebrard,</hi> that the Popes, for the space of seven score years and ten almost, from <hi>John</hi> VIII. to <hi>Leo</hi> IX. about fifty Popes did revolt wholly from the vertue of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and were <hi>Apostatical,</hi> rather than <hi>Apostolical:</hi> and that some of them came not in by the <hi>Door,</hi> but were <hi>Thi ves</hi> and <hi>Robbers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That it is not impossible to <hi>forge</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords for the Bolstering up of <hi>Heresies,</hi> those counter eit <hi>Gospels, Acts, Epistles, Revelations,</hi> &amp;c. that were put forth by Hereticks in the Names of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> do sufficiently evidence; which being
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55872:20"/>
extant a little after the Apostles decease, are pointed to by <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> condemned in a <hi>Roman Council</hi> by <hi>Gelasius,</hi> and some of them recorded by <hi>Ivo Cartonensis,</hi> in a Catalogue <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi>

                     <p>I note the two last, because S. <hi>Clement</hi> in his first Epistle to S. <hi>James,</hi> is <hi>made</hi> to approve the one, and Pope <hi>Pius</hi> in his Decretal magnifieth the other. Which giveth us a little glympse of the Knavery by which those Ancient Bishops and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre of <hi>Rome</hi> were both abused, having Spurious Writings fathered upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; for had those <hi>Instruments</hi> been their <hi>own,</hi> they would never have owned such abominable <hi>Forgeries.</hi> But of this you may expect more hereafter, <hi>Cap.</hi> 16. and <hi>Cap.</hi> 17.</p>
                     <p>These aggravations and degrees of Forgery we have not mentioned in vain, or by accident. In the process of our discourse, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will be found guilty of them all, except the first, which is beneath her Grandeur; and in so doing, she is very strangely secured by the height of her impiety. For because it does not easily enter into the heart of man to conceive, that men, especially
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55872:21"/>
Christians, should <hi>voluntarily</hi> commit so transcendent a Crime, the greatness of it makes it incredible to inexperienced peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and renders them prone to <hi>excuse</hi> the Malefactors, while they <hi>condemn</hi> the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers.</p>
                     <p>But that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is guilty in all these respects, we shall prove not by remote Authorities, that are weak and feeble, but by demonstrations derived from the Root and Fountain. I will not be <hi>positive</hi> in making <hi>comparisons;</hi> but if my <hi>reading</hi> and <hi>judgment</hi> do not both deceive me, she is guilty of more For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries than all the Hereticks in the world beside: Their greatness and their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber countenance the <hi>Charge,</hi> and seem to promise that one day it shall pass into a <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Condemnation</hi> against her.</p>

                     <p>For first, the Copy which <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> brought from <hi>Nice,</hi> (he being himself one of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in that Council) was orderly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and the two Canons which the Roman Bishop sent were not there.

                     <p>Upon this the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, his Arrogance and Usurpation suppressed by <hi>Canons,</hi> and his Pride cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised by <hi>Letters;</hi> the Letters and Canons being yet extant.

In these words they cut the Popes Arrogance sufficiently, for that he being but <hi>One,</hi> was so highly conceited of himself, at least so behaved himself, as if he had an extraordinary Spirit of Infallibility, and were fitter to determine the Causes of the Church, than a whole Council of Bishops assembled together.

time have fastned such a Wen upon the body of so Venerable a Canon, I am almost ready to think, that we scarcely have any thing of Antiquity left us, that is entire and uncorrupt, except it be in matters of indifferency, or which could not have been corrupted, but with much noise,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>He further tells us, (in the place before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned) <hi>That whereas the Greek</hi> Code, Num. 206. <hi>sets before us in the</hi> XXVIII<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Canon of the General Council of</hi> Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>a Decree of those Fathers; by which conformably to the first Council of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople, <hi>they ordained, that seeing the City of</hi> Constantinople <hi>was the Seat of the Senate, and of the Empire, and enjoyed the same Priviledges with the City of</hi> Rome, <hi>that therefore it should in like manner be advanced to the same Height and Greatness in Ecclesiastical Affairs, being the second Church in Order after</hi> Rome; <hi>and that the Bishop should have the Ordaining of Metropolitans in the three Diocesses of</hi> Pontus, Asia, <hi>and</hi> Thrace. <hi>Which Canon is found both in</hi> Balsamon <hi>and</hi> Zonoras; <hi>and also hath the Testimony of the greatest part of the Ecclesiastical Historians, both Greek and Latine, that it is a Legitimate Canon of the Council of</hi> Chalcedon, <hi>in the Acts of which Council, at this day also

extant, it is set down at large: Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, in the collection of</hi> Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius Exiguus <hi>it appears not at all, no more than as if there had never been any such thing thought of at</hi> Chalcedon.

                     <p>Upon this advantage, the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> advanced himself above the other Patriarchs; and his <hi>See</hi> being made equal to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Authority of the <hi>Church,</hi> upon the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest he had in the Empire then setled in <hi>Greece,</hi> he arrogated the Title of <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Bishop:</hi> Which <hi>Gregory,</hi> then Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome,</hi> so highly stomacked, that he thundered out Letters against him, calling the Title a proud and prophane,<note place="margin">

                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:55872:28"/>
because he brake the Order of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, and despised the Equality of his Fellow-Bishops. Now whether it does not hit his own Predecessors, <hi>Zozimus,</hi> and <hi>Boniface,</hi> and <hi>Celestine,</hi> and <hi>Leo,</hi> I leave to the judgment of the Reader: They were not contented with an Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Power, but aspired, and that some of them by the most odious way, that of Lying and Forgery, as well as Pride and Ambition, to the top of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity.</p>
                     <p>Whether this <hi>Zeal of Gregory</hi> was <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledge,</hi> that is, whether it proceeded from <hi>integrity,</hi> or <hi>self interest,</hi> I shall not determine. All that I observe is this which followeth, when the Tyde turned, and the Emperour next sided with the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the very next Successor of <hi>Gregory</hi> but one, took up the <hi>Title,</hi> a little before condemned for <hi>blasphemous,</hi> which is claimed by the <hi>Roman Bishops</hi> to this day.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour sided with the Roman Bishop, because the Roman Bishop sided with him: For when <hi>Phocas</hi> had mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Master, the good old Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Mauricius,</hi> and usurped the Throne in his stead, the Title of <hi>Vniversal Bishop</hi> was given to the Patriarch of <hi>Rome</hi> by
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55872:29"/>
this Bloody Tyrant, to secure his own; which had so great a Flaw in it, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the assistance of some powerful A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. </p>
                     <p>Hereupon a Council was called at<note place="margin">Helvic. <hi>Chronol.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Boniface</hi> 3. wherein the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Emperour <hi>Phocas</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged, and the Bishop of <hi>Romo</hi> made a POPE, upon the encouragement of the <hi>Tyrant,</hi> by the consent of the Council: but his own, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Roman Council.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Boniface</hi> and <hi>Phocas</hi> were great Friends: The Imperial and Triple Crown were barter'd between them: Connivance and Commerce soiling them both with the guilt of Murder, Simony, Treason; and if S. <hi>Gregory</hi> may be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, with <hi>Sacriledge</hi> and <hi>Blasphemy:</hi> For being involved in a mutual Conspiracy, they became guilty of each others crimes; to partake with Adulterers, and comply with Offenders, being imputed as sin, in the H. Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Platina, <hi>an Eminent Writer of the Lives of the Popes, and a Papist himself, informeth us sufficiently of this business, in these words,</hi> Boniface <hi>111. (saith he)</hi> a<note place="margin">Platin. <hi>in vir.</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nif. 3.</note>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55872:29"/>
is the Head of all the Churches) should be so called, and so accounted of all: which place the Church of <hi>Constantinople</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to vindicate to it self, evil Princes sometimes favouring it, and affirming the first see to be due to the place where the Head of the Empire was.</p>
                     <p>In the Life of <hi>Zozimus the first Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Forger</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome, Plati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> mentioneth the foresaid business at <hi>Carthage;</hi> but so briefly, that it is clear he did not like it. And to close up all, in the Life of this <hi>Boniface</hi> he endeavours to strengthen the Title of the <hi>Roman</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop against the Patriarch of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> by the <hi>Donation</hi> of <hi>Constantine,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Forgery, of which hereafter.</p>

                        </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We are pleased, that if a Bishop be accused, and the Bishops of his Country being assembled together, have judged him, and deposed him from his Degree, and he thinks fit to Appeal, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55872:30"/>
shall fly to the most blessed Bishop of the Roman Church, and shall desire to be heard, and he shall think it just that the Tryal be renewed; then he [the Roman Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop] shall vouchsafe to write to the B. shops of the adjoyning and bordering Province, that they should diligently examine all, and define according to the Truth. But if any one thinks fit that his Cause be heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and by his own Supplication moves the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he should send a [Legate or] Priest from his side; it shall be in his power to do as he listeth, and as he thinketh fit. And if he shall decree that some ought to be sent, that being present themselves might judge with the Bishops, having his Authority by whom they were sent, it shall be according to his judgment: but if he think the Bishops sufficient to end the business, he shall do what in his most wise counsel he judgeth meet.</p>
                     <p>Here the <hi>Roman Bishop,</hi> nay the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>Priest</hi> he shall please to send as his <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> is exalted above all Councils, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and Patriarchs in the world; he may do, and undo, act, add, rescind, diminish, alter, whatsoever he pleaseth in any Council, when the Causes of the most Eminent Rank in the Church do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend in the same. All Bishops are by this
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55872:30"/>
Canon made more to fear the Roman Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop than their own Patriarch, and are ingaged, if need be, to side with him against their Patriarch: the Gate is open for all the Wealth in the World to flow into his Ecclesiastical Court, which is as much above the Court of any other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, by this Right of Appeals, as the Archbishops Court above any inferiour Bishops, while we may Appeal to that from these at our pleasure. Thus Bishops and Patriarchs are made to buckle under the Popes Cirdle, and the Decrees of Councils are put under his foot: And all this is no more but half a Step to the Popes Chair.</p>
                     <p>The other part of the Step in this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitorium,</hi> was the following Canon concerning Priests:</p>
                     <p>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ought not to pass that over in silence, that does yet move me: If any Bishop happen to be angry (as he ought not) and be suddenly or sharply moved against his Priest or Deacon, and would cast him out of his Church, Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must be made, that he be not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned being Innocent, or lose the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Let him that is cast out have power to Appeal to the Borderers, that his Cause might be heard, and handled more careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55872:31"/>
for a Hearing ought not to be denied him when he asks it: And the Bishop, which hath either justly or unjustly ejected him, shall patiently suffer, that the business be lookt into, and his Sentence either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, or rectified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What is the meaning of this, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>Binius, Labbè, Cossartius,</hi> and the <hi>Collectio Regia,</hi> I cannot tell; but doubtless the Canon intends the same in the close with the former, that the last Appeal is reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the Roman Chair; which made the Fathers in the sixth Council of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> so angry as we find them, to see things so false and presumptuous, fastned upon the first most Glorious Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Council, which decreed the clean contrary, in the 4 and 5 Canons.

That this therefore might more decently be inquired into, we think it fit, that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils should every year, throughout every Province, twice be celebrated: That such Questions may be discussed by the common Authority of all the Bishops assembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: And so they, that have evidently offended against their Bishop, shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Excommunicated, according to to reason, by all; till it pleaseth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of Bishops to pronounce a milder Sentence upon such.

Opinion; but I take the <hi>Stream</hi> of them together.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Luther</hi> appeared in the year 1517. The first that appeared after him was <hi>James Merlin,</hi> in the year 1535. The next was <hi>Peter Crabbe,</hi> in the year 1538.

                     </p>
                     <p>Finally observe, that <hi>Isidore</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> the first of the Compilers, whose Works are extant, lay down the Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, simply and plainly, for good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords; but <hi>Binius,</hi> and his Followers, by reason of the Arguments which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not answer, begin to confess some of them to be Forgeries: So do the most Grave and Learned Cardinals, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> though they still carry on the <hi>Design</hi> of the first <hi>Inventers,</hi> by some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Methods, which they hope will suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed better.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it any wonder, that a <hi>Secular Kingdom</hi> should make men more <hi>active</hi> than the love of <hi>Heaven;</hi> since we daily see, how the Kings of the world expend vast Treasures of Gold and Silver, and run through all dangers of Death and Battel, for their own preservation, and the Conquest of their Neighbours.

of the Church: though as <hi>Blondel</hi> and Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> accurately observe, S. <hi>Isidore</hi> of <hi>Hispalis</hi> was dead 40, 50, 60 years, before some things came to pass that are mentioned in that Book of the Councils.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Blondel</hi> in a Book of his, called <hi>Pseu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do-Isidorus,</hi> or <hi>Turrianus Vapulans, Cap</hi> 2. observes, how the lowest that write of <hi>Isidores</hi> death, fix it on the year 647. as <hi>Vasaeus</hi> in his Chronicle: Others on the year 643. as <hi>Rodericus Toletanus Hist. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. Or on the year 635. as <hi>the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Office of the Saints of</hi> Spain: or on the year 636. when <hi>Sinthalus</hi> entered his Kingdom, as <hi>Redemptus Diaconus,</hi> an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witness, <hi>De Obitu</hi> Isidori.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Brauleo</hi> Bishop of <hi>Caesar-Augustana, Lucas Tudensts, Baronius</hi> the great Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list, <hi>Mariana, Grialus,</hi> and others, agree with the last; which is eleven years soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than <hi>Vasaeus.</hi> So that the general pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Opinion is, that <hi>Isidore</hi> of <hi>Hispalis</hi> died in the year 636. However, that we may deal most fairly with them, we will allow them all they can desire, and calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late our affair by the last Account, which is most for their advantage.</p>
                     <p>Admit <hi>Vasaeus</hi> in the right, that <hi>Isidore</hi> lived till the year 647. yet the Book
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55872:41"/>
which is Fathered upon him, can be none of his; for it mentions things which came to pass long after.</p>
                     <p>It is observed by <hi>Blondel,</hi> that <hi>Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Isidore</hi> in the See of <hi>Hispalis,</hi> is found in the sixth Council of <hi>Toledo;</hi> whereas this pretended <hi>Isidore</hi> makes mention of the eleventh Council in the same place. He talks of the sixth <hi>Oecumenical Council,</hi> in the year 681. no less than 46 years after his own death, by the lowest account. He writes of <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> of <hi>Mentz,</hi> slain as <hi>Baronius</hi> observes, in the year 755. which was threescore and sixteen years after <hi>Isidores</hi> death: Yet <hi>Possevin,</hi> upon the word <hi>Isidorus Hisp.</hi> and <hi>Hart</hi> in his Conference with <hi>Reynolds,</hi> contend the Author of this Book to be the true <hi>Isidore, Bishop of Hispalis,</hi> as <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> who first published <hi>Isidore</hi> in print, and others did before them.</p>
                     <p>Among his Witnesses produced against this Counterfeit, the first which <hi>Blondel</hi> useth, is the <hi>Code of the Roman Church;</hi> in which onely the Epistles of 13 Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bishops are contained, beginning with <hi>Siricius:</hi> Whereas there are in <hi>Isi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> above 60. whereof five or six and thirty lived before <hi>Siricius,</hi> and were all unknown until the time of <hi>Isidore.</hi>

                     <p>His next Testimony is that of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>France,</hi> about the year 865. who concluded, that <hi>Isidore'</hi>s Wares <hi>then newly beginning to be sold, could not have the force of</hi> Canons, <hi>because they were not contained in the</hi> Authentick Code, <hi>or Book of Canons formerly known.</hi>

                     <p>For the making of which Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie the more plain, and to shew what they mean by the <hi>Body of the Canons,</hi> he tells us, <hi>It is certain, that the more Ancient Collection of the Decretal Epistles of the Roman Bishops, and the Canons of divers Councils, acquired such a name, that the Volum was called,</hi> The Book, <hi>or</hi> Code, <hi>or</hi> BODY of CANONS, <hi>increased by the addition of other Councils, which were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards celebrated.

will not have the book so much as <hi>known</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> nay not in <hi>France,</hi> which is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unto <hi>Spain,</hi> for 800 years time, but that it came out of <hi>Spain</hi> first, being brought by <hi>Riculphus.</hi> Perhaps <hi>Riculphus</hi> was never there.

                     <p>But he fails in his design: for as it is strange, that <hi>Italy</hi> should not know the Decretal Epistles of its <hi>own</hi> Popes for 800 years, till <hi>Riculphus</hi> brought them out of <hi>Spain;</hi> so is it more strange, that being such <hi>Forgeries</hi> as he would have them, <hi>Hincmarus</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Rhemes</hi> should be accused for condemning them, and ratled up, and Branded in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and compelled to recant by so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful an Enemy; for it seems he had no way to save himself, but by <hi>renouncing</hi> his Opinion. The jealousie of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church,</hi> and its tenderness over <hi>Isi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:55872:44"/>
appeareth most exceeding great in the <hi>hard dealing</hi> which <hi>Hincmarus</hi> met with, who though he did recant, was still <hi>noted with infamy;</hi> as if to speak against <hi>Isidore,</hi> were a Crime not to be washed off by the <hi>Tears</hi> of Repentance in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Perhaps the poor Bishop was an Hypocrite in that forced Confession, and for this was branded, because he confessed a <hi>lye,</hi> as men upon the Rack are wont to do, for his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance: for that he knew still that <hi>Isi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> was a Counterfeit, and must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be reputed a rotten Member of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> This <hi>Baronius</hi> observes, while he ascribeth <hi>Hincmarus</hi> his repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending <hi>Isidore'</hi>s Collection, to his <hi>keener scent;</hi> whereby he was able, more readily than others, to <hi>smell</hi> a <hi>Rat,</hi> and discover the <hi>Cheat.</hi>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55872:45"/>
wholly abstained from them (which that he knew to be doubtful at least, is not to be doubted) using only those, concerning which there was never any doubt in the Church of God; because the Church did not want those adventitious, and late invented Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, because it might receive them abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly from other places: but <hi>Benedictus Levita</hi> himself also, though (as you have heard from <hi>Hincmarus,</hi> and as he himself testifies in the Preface before his books) he took many things out of that same Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Isidore;</hi> yet being conscious in himself, that the Authority of those Epistles was not so sure, but that it nodded exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, he never cited any Author of them, as he did in the other Epistles of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bishops, <hi>Innocent, Leo, Gelasius, Symmachus,</hi> and <hi>Gregory;</hi> naming the Authors of those, whose Faith was clear and certain. But further yet, with great caution, because he knew the Evidences ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them not to be so firm, he took care, as he testifies in the end, to have them confirmed by the Apostolick Authority.</p>
                     <p>Is not here a merry passage? <hi>Benedictus Levita</hi> knew the Decretal Epistles to be <hi>false,</hi> and therefore he got them to be <hi>made true</hi> by the Popes Authority; at least to be <hi>confirmed</hi> as <hi>true,</hi> whereas they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55872:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were <hi>doubtful</hi> before. It is the manner of sometimes, to get o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to propose the matters, which they themselves design to be done; that the business springing from the request of others, might appear more <hi>graceful</hi> in the eye of the people. We may justly enquire, whether <hi>Benedictus Levita</hi> were not <hi>ordered</hi> what to Petition, by private instructions from his Holiness, before he made his motion to the Chair: for it had otherwise been an <hi>extravagant impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> to have assaulted the Chair with such a request as that is, of craving a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of new-found Records, so fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and suspected. Whatever the <hi>Intrigue</hi> was, the <hi>event</hi> is clear, <hi>Benedictus Levita</hi> got them <hi>confirmed,</hi> and so they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted for his Holiness Children, though Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> was shy a little out of shame and modesty, and blushed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his poor Kindred.</p>
                     <p>It is further observable, that these counterfeit <hi>Epistles</hi> were first brought in into the Records of the <hi>Franks,</hi> without naming their Authors: and that a little after their <hi>quiet</hi> publication, some Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of the Chair grew more bold, and added their <hi>names</hi> unto them; this of <hi>Clement,</hi> that of <hi>Anacletus,</hi> &amp;c. And that the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55872:46"/>
work was thus perfected by degrees, <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> shews us in the following passage.</p>
                     <p>But he who first published the Decrees<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ibid nu.</hi> 7.</note> extracted out of those Epistles, with the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the <hi>Roman Bishops,</hi> in whose names they are recorded, was that <hi>Hincmarus</hi> we mentioned, the Bishop of <hi>Laon,</hi> as appears by an Epistle or book written against him by <hi>Hincmarus</hi> of <hi>Rhemes;</hi> who receiving that work of the Bishop of <hi>Laon,</hi> read it not without indignation, and in very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things reprovedit. But others have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Bishop of <hi>Laon,</hi> as <hi>Burchardus,</hi> who writ in the following Age, and others after him, who prefixed the names of the very <hi>Roman Bishops</hi> before all the <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> which <hi>Gratian</hi> also did the last of all.</p>
                     <p>But that those Epistles are rendered su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitious, by many things which we have said in the second Tome of our Annals, while we mentioned each in particular, is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently demonstrated: Where we shewed withal, that the holy <hi>Roman Church</hi> did not need them, so as (if they should be detected of falsity) to be bereaved of its Rights and Priviledges, since (though she wanteth them) she is abundantly streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened and confirmed by the Legitimate and Genuine Decretal Epistles of other
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55872:46"/>
Popes. But that the <hi>Chapters</hi> taken out of them by <hi>Benedictus Levita,</hi> were at first approved, as agreeable to the <hi>Canons</hi> (as himself testifies) by the Authority of the <hi>Roman Bishops,</hi> (which was done also by the latter Collectors) it happened rather by long use, than for any strength or firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in themselves.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>Baronius</hi> in his <hi>Annals, An.</hi> 865. <hi>nu.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8. all together.</p>
                     <p>In Notis Martyrol. ad 4. April. <hi>he saith, Vasaeus</hi> is convicted to have erred, who thought this <hi>Isidore Pacensis</hi> that <hi>Isidore</hi> who collected the Epistles of the <hi>Roman Bishops,</hi> and the <hi>Councils,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus Laudunensis</hi> also, and <hi>Trithemius,</hi> and others err, who ascribe that collection to <hi>Isidore</hi> of <hi>Hispalis:</hi> That Opinion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felled; first, because <hi>Brauleus</hi> and <hi>Ilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonsus,</hi> who lived in those times, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a Catalogue of his Writings, make not the least mention of that work. But further, all doubt is taken away concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this matter, while the Author of that work, speaking there concerning the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of holding a <hi>Council.</hi> recites the words of the first <hi>Canon</hi> of the eleventh Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and mentions <hi>Agatho</hi> the Pope in his Preface, since <hi>Isidore</hi> of <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spalis</hi> departed this life, long before the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55872:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
times of that <hi>Council,</hi> and Pope <hi>Agatho.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Had we time, we might make many curious reflexions upon these passages of <hi>Baronius:</hi> He afterwards talks of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Isidore,</hi> called sometimes <hi>Mercator,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Peccator;</hi> but of what Parents, what Calling, what City, or what Country he was, he mentioneth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. So that this <hi>Child,</hi> among all those <hi>Isidores</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> that are found out for it, must rest at last in one that is <hi>unknown.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All that can be gathered from this whole discourse of <hi>Baronius,</hi> is this, That a new Book of Councils, richly fraught with Evidences for the <hi>Roman Church</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> came abroad under the name of <hi>Isidore,</hi> containing Decrees and Decretal Epistles that were never before heard of in the world: that this Book was <hi>falsly</hi> Fathered upon <hi>Isidore</hi> of <hi>Hispalis;</hi> and that all those ancient Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of the Roman Bishops, from S. <hi>Peter</hi> down to <hi>Siricius,</hi> are justly suspected: Nay, he confesses them to be <hi>insirm, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventitions,</hi> and <hi>lately invented,</hi> or <hi>newly found,</hi> and to <hi>nod exceedingly:</hi> He op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth them to those Records which are <hi>Legitimate</hi> and <hi>Genuine,</hi> though they are of late magnified, and followed by all
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55872:47"/>
the Collectors of the Decrees and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, being, though waved by some, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and <hi>approved</hi> by other Popes, as well as Doctors, Jesuites, Cardinals, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This is the last and best Story that can be made on the behalf of that <hi>Book,</hi> the Counterfeits in which, as we observed before, were, because they extol and magnifie the Popes Chair, received for good and Authentick <hi>Laws</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> For <hi>Baronius</hi> died not long since, about the year 1607. in this last Century; and when he had seen the truth of those Arguments that are urged against the Forgeries, endeavours so to handle this matter in his History, as to clear the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that saw not into this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery so clearly, takes another course; which when we have intimated one or two Marginal Notes in <hi>Baronius,</hi> we shall declare. <hi>Baronius</hi> deals more fairly with us than <hi>Binius;</hi> for the one in his Marginal Notes contradicteth his Text, sometimes to delude the Reader: but <hi>Baronius</hi> fairly notes in the Margin, Isidori <hi>collectio vulgata in Galliis.</hi> Isi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dori <hi>collectio ab Antiquis non adeo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bata.</hi> Isidori <hi>collectio ut minùs sincera

A stile too too lofty for those purer times of humble simplicity: The usual Compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of those days (as may be seen by S. <hi>Cyprian'</hi>s Letters to the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> and some other good Records) being far more <hi>short</hi> and <hi>samiliar;</hi> such as <hi>Julio Vrbis Romae Episcopo,</hi> or, <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no fratri,</hi> or, <hi>Cornelio Collegae &amp; Coepisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po;</hi> that is, <hi>to</hi> Julius <hi>Bishop of the City of</hi> Rome, or <hi>to</hi> Stephen <hi>my Brother,</hi> or <hi>to</hi> Cornelius <hi>my Associate and Fellow bishop:</hi> Nor can we find any other, in undoubted instruments, for the first 300 or 400 years: But for an <hi>Vsurper</hi> to be called

Many men have stiled themselves Archbishops of <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> but no man (as I remember) <hi>Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of a Council.</hi> There may be Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in a Council, but not an Archbishop of the Council. <hi>Three Councils at once in the same Province</hi> were never heard of: One and the same <hi>Letter sent from three Councils</hi> is a strange thing: So is a Letter sent in the name of one Archbishop, as <hi>President of three Councils</hi> at a time.</p>
                     <p>After this we have 6 Epistles of <hi>Siri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> 2 of <hi>Anastasius,</hi> 19 of <hi>Innocent,</hi> 2 of <hi>Zozimus,</hi> 3 of <hi>Boniface,</hi> with feveral An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers: Among which there is inserted a <hi>Constitution of</hi> Honorius <hi>the Emperour</hi> sent to <hi>Boniface, That if there were two Bishops of</hi> Rome <hi>made any more, they should be both driven out of the City:</hi> Which shews how subject the Roman Chair is to Schismes, and the Power that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55872:56"/>
did of old belong to the Emperour.</p>
                     <p>There are other Epistles of <hi>Celestine, Sixtus, Leo, Hilarius Simplicius Felix, Gelasius, Anastasias, Symmachus, Hormisda, &amp;c.</hi> the most of which do much exceed our compass of the first 400 years, and are too late for our Cognizance: For since the Forgery of <hi>Zozimus,</hi> much cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit is not to be given to the Roman Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops: Not as if one mans fault had bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted them all; but he leads up the Van of Forgets, and they have all persisted in his Guilt, no one of them making ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment or restitution, and almost all of them guilty of the like, either by doing, or suffering.</p>
                     <p>Among the rest there is an Instrument, which the Collector calleth, <hi>Sacra</hi> Justini <hi>Imperatoris ad</hi> Hormisdam <hi>Papam:</hi> The Sacred Writing of the Emperour <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> to <hi>Hormisda</hi> Pope. But the word POPE is not in the superscription: The Letter it self is, <hi>To the most Holy and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Archbishop and Patriarch of the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable City of</hi> Rome, Hormisda. Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop and Fatriarch we allow him; but not that <hi>Typhus</hi> wherewith the Fathers in the sixth Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> charge <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimus,</hi> that <hi>blasphemous Title</hi> which <hi>John</hi> assumed at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>

so declaimed against at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Letter of <hi>Justin</hi> the Emperour was written more than 500 years after our Saviours Birth, yet I never saw true Record, in all that time, give a Title so high to the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> But <hi>Justin</hi> was a man of low Descent, a Swineherd at first, a Carpenter afterwards, then a Souldier of Fortune, and at last an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour: He was the more solicitous therefore to complement so Mighty a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop with accurate expression.</p>
                     <p>Note well. <hi>Isidore</hi> has suppressed all the Canons of the sixth Council of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> as too bitter and sharp for the Popes Constitution. And so has <hi>Merlin,</hi> though very foolishly: for in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Book he hath a Preliminary Tract, called, <hi>An Annotation of Synods, the Acts where of are contained in this book.</hi> In which he giveth us this account: in the <hi>Aquitan</hi> Council, 18 Fathers made 24 Canons: in that of <hi>Neocaesarea,</hi> 16 Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers made 14 Canons: in that of <hi>Gangra,</hi> 16 Fathers made 21 Canons: in that of <hi>Sardica,</hi> 60 Fathers made 21 Canons: in that of <hi>Antioch,</hi> 30 Fathers made 25 Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons: in that of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> 22 Fathers made 59 Canons: in the Council of <hi>Car thage,</hi> 217 Fathers made 33 Canons. I
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55872:57"/>
had a long time coveted a sight of these Canons, and finding them numbred in such <hi>an Annotation of Synods, the Acts whereof are contained in this book,</hi> I was much comforted with hope of seeing them: But when I turned to the place, I found them not! Surely to slip out 33 Canons at a time, made by more Fathers than were in all the other Councils put together, is a lusty <hi>Deleatur:</hi> There was never <hi>Deed</hi> of more importance imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelled in the World.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Nicene Council</hi> had 318 Fathers, that made 20 Canons: for what secret cause therefore he skippeth over the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which he ought especially to give of this, is worth the enquiry. He men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it by the <hi>by,</hi> and shuffles it off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an account, (perhaps) because he was loath to say, or unsay the story of 70 Canons in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he dealeth fairly with us in this, that having noted <hi>Aurelius</hi> to have been Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident in the sixth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> he confesseth, <hi>that S.</hi> Augustine, <hi>Bishop of</hi> Hipyo, <hi>is recorded to have been in that Council, in the Reign of</hi> Honorius. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Binius, and all the Popish Compilers I could ever meet with before, clipped off that Council in the midst, without so
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55872:57"/>
much as signifying the <hi>number</hi> of its Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons. I was glad I had a sight of their number <hi>here,</hi> though I mist of themselves: and was confident, that however cruelly the Pope dealt with <hi>Aurelius</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> S. <hi>Aug.</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hippo,</hi> and other holy Fathers, in cutting out their Tongues, I should at last meet with them: And the Learned <hi>Justellus</hi> with much honesty and honour has made us satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                     <p>We acknowledge some <hi>true</hi> Records among these <hi>Spurious</hi> Abominations: but a little <hi>poyson</hi> spoileth the greatest Mess of the most wholesom Meat; much more doth a Bundle of Forgeries that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyseth the true Records in <hi>size</hi> and <hi>number.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The method which he useth in the <hi>mixture</hi> of the Records and Forgeries is remarkable: For beginning with the Counterfeit Epistles of <hi>Clement, Anacle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, &amp;c.</hi> he first seasoneth the Readers spirit with Artificial <hi>Charms,</hi> and <hi>prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth</hi> him with the high Authority of the Roman Patriarchs; and after he has given him those strong Spells and <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres,</hi> composed of <hi>Roman Drugs,</hi> permits him boldly to see some true Antiquities, his eyes being dazled in the very <hi>Entry,</hi>
                        <pb n="80" facs="tcp:55872:58"/>
with Apparitions of Popes, and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Spectres.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lest the <hi>Tincture</hi> should decay, he reserves some of the Forgeries till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; that the <hi>true Records</hi> might be compassed in with an <hi>Enchanted Circle,</hi> and the last <hi>Relish</hi> of Antiquity go off as strong as the first, and be as successful as the <hi>prepossession.</hi> Thus he cometh down with Forgeries to <hi>Melchiades;</hi> and then he breaketh off the <hi>Decretal Epistles,</hi> to make room for the <hi>Councils,</hi> beginning with the <hi>Nicene,</hi> under pretence of its Excellency, and putting the Councils before it in time, after it in order that he might get a fit occasion to introduce them here, so running down in a disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly manner, from <hi>Ancyra</hi> to <hi>Neocaesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea, Gangra, Sardica, Antioch, Laodicea, Constantinople, Ephesus, Chalcedon,</hi> among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and then up again to the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Councils,</hi> many of which preceded divers of the other; as the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth Council of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> all which were before the Council of <hi>Constantinople, Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> From the seventh Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> he runneth down to the thirteenth Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Toledo,</hi> which happened long after <hi>Melchiades, Silvester,</hi> Pope <hi>Mark Liberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55872:58"/>
Felix,</hi> &amp;c. were dead: Then he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth (in the second part of his Work) up again to <hi>Sylvester,</hi> and so downwards with more Decretals, that he might Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band his Forgeries well, and not glut us with them altogether. And remarkable it is also, that he doth not give us the least syllable of notice of any Fraud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: Nay, even <hi>Constantine's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> set in the Front before the <hi>Nicene,</hi> and in the midst between the first Order of Counterfeits and the Councils, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth with him silently and gravely for a true and sacred Instrument, which is of all other the most impudent Imposture.</p>
                     <p>Let <hi>Baronius</hi> say what he will, it was impossible to <hi>debauch</hi> all Antiquity and Learning with so much <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Art,</hi> without some deep <hi>Counsel</hi> and <hi>Design.</hi> What use <hi>Merlin</hi> puts all these things to, and how much he was Approved in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> you shall see in the next Chapter, and how highly also he extolleth this Book ofF orgeries.</p>

Their Doctrine of <hi>Pious Frauds</hi> is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known: And if we may do evil that good may come, certainly no good, like the Exaltation of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> can possibly be found, wherewith to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie a little evil.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Jesuites Morals</hi> are well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood: Upon their Principles to do evil, is no evil, if good may ensue. Perjury it self may be dispenced with by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their Superiour. An illimited Blind Obedience is the <hi>sum</hi> of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.

                     <p>It is a sufficient Warrant, upon such grounds, to <hi>James Merlin</hi> our present Author, that he was commanded to do what he did, by great and eminent Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> as he sheweth in his Epistle Dedicatory, <hi>To
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55872:61"/>
the most Reverend Fathers in Christ, and his most excellent Lords,</hi> Stephen <hi>and</hi> Francis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the one of which was Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the other an Eminent Prelate, who ordered all his work by their care, and made it publick by their own Authority.</p>
                     <p>Conceiving nothing <hi>(saith he)</hi> more profitable for the Commonwealth, I have not dissembled to bring the Decrees of the Sacred Councils and Orthodox Bishops, which partly the blessed <hi>Isidore</hi> sometime since digested into one, partly you, most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Fathers, having confirmed them with your Leaden Seal, gave me to be published in one Volume: For every particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth so copiously and Catholickly handled here, which is necessary for the convicting of the Errours of mortal men, or for the restoring of the <hi>now almost ruined World,</hi> that every man may readily find wherewith to kill Hereticks and Heresies.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Protestants</hi> being grown so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that they had almost ruined the <hi>Popish World,</hi> by reforming the Church; nothing but this <hi>Medusa's Head</hi> of Snakes and Forgeries was able to affray them. The nakedness of the <hi>Pontisicians</hi> being discovered, they had no Retreat from the Light of the Gospel, but to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55872:61"/>
of Lies: <hi>Where every one may readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find,</hi> saith Merlin, <hi>wherewith to kill Hereticks and Heresies, to depress the proud, to weary the voluptuous, to bring down the ambitious, to take the little Foxes that spoil the Vineyard of the Church.</hi> By the proud and ambitious, he meaneth Kings and Patriarchs, that will not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Authority and Supremacy of the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> and by the <hi>little Foxes,</hi> such men as the Martyrs in the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches; the driving away of which was the design of the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That he meaneth <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs</hi> in the former, you will see in the Conclusion.</p>
                     <p>And if any one shall hereafter endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour<note place="margin">15</note> to fray, and drive away these Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters from the Commonwealth, what can be more excellent, <hi>saith he,</hi> than the stones of <hi>David,</hi> which this <hi>Jordan</hi> shall most copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously afford?

And for this cause I was the more desirous to see the <hi>Book,</hi> which is very scarce to be found; and the more scarce, I suppose, because if the Fountain be unknown, a greater Majesty will accrue to the Streams. The Booksellers-Shops afforded me none: but at last I met with two of them; the one with the Learned Dr. <hi>Barlow, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet Professor,</hi> and <hi>Provost</hi> of <hi>Queens Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> the other in the <hi>Bodleian</hi> Library: The one was Printed at <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lein, An</hi> 1530.

                     <p>Though some afterwards are careful to distinguish <hi>Isidore Hispalensis</hi> from <hi>Isi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore Mercator.</hi> The one failing, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is obtruded as the Author of the Work: the latter <hi>Collectors</hi> unanimously leaving out <hi>Hispalensis,</hi> and calling him only by the Name of <hi>Mercator.</hi> But how the Name of <hi>Isidore Mercator</hi> should

                     </p>
                     <p>It is said, that Eulogius <hi>Bishop of</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duba<note place="margin">Blondel, <hi>cap.</hi> 6.</note> 
                        <hi>had a Brother, whose Name was</hi> Isi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, <hi>whose condition of Life Banishment, whose Nation</hi> Spain, <hi>whose Trade was Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize: And that this Spanish Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant flying out of his Country, upon the account of Religion, chose rather to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust this most precious Treasure, which he had saved from the Lust of Barbarians, to the care of the Germans, than to expose it to the Rage of those Wasters and Destroyers wherewith</hi> Spain <hi>was at that time infested, as the Monks of</hi> Mentz; <hi>at least, who, upon his having sojourned there, took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to put his Name before the Book that was then in their hands, would have the World really to believe.</hi> This is <hi>Blondel'</hi>s conjecture, which he raiseth from the real existence of such an <hi>Isidore.</hi> But he excuseth himself for <hi>conjecturing barely</hi> in such an affair, because the Work is <hi>a Work of Darkness,</hi> and they that did it, hated the Light, because their Deeds were evil: <hi>And the Patcher up of those Epistles coming forth in the Vizor of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Name,</hi> in such <hi>a business</hi> a conjecture may suffice. Let them that imposed the

                     <p>It is not impossible, but a Knave, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Isidore,</hi> might be sent abroad with the Book, being pickt out on purpose, that the Famous <hi>Isidore,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hispalis,</hi> might be believed to be the Author. He might come to <hi>Mentz,</hi> and sojourn there under the notion of a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and give <hi>Riculphus,</hi> or the Monks, a sight of the Book, as a rare inestimable Treasure: For <hi>Sinon</hi> was let loose, with as little Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice as this, to the Destruction of <hi>Troy.</hi> Thus, whence it came really, could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be discovered; and the Thing too would be the more admired, because it came from the <hi>farthest Regions,</hi> as <hi>Merlin</hi> speaks, being saved so Miraculously from the hands of <hi>Barbarians.</hi> But where did this Traveller find it? this Merchant, of whom did he receive it? For <hi>morally</hi> speaking, it is impossible, that a Merchant should be the Author of it; especially at that time, when the Records lay scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered perhaps in an hundred Libraries, and were all to be sought in obscure <hi>Manuscripts.</hi> An Ass may be expected to meddle with an Harp, as soon as a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant

with the Mysterious Records of the Church. How come <hi>Lay-men</hi> to be so Judicious? Had any Merchant so great a Skill as this imports? It is improbable <hi>fourscore Bishops</hi> should know its much more that they should urge him to do that, which their own Learning and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction fitted them to do far better: Yet <hi>Isidore</hi> in his Preface writeth thus, <hi>You Eighty Bishops, who urged me to begin and perfect this Work, ought to know, as ought all other Priests of the Lord also, that we have found more than those</hi> 20 <hi>Chapters of the Nicene Council,</hi> &amp;c. It is a shame to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that a Lay-man should be the Fountain of all her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords; and that in very deed, the greater part of them should be in no Manuscript nor Library in the World, being never seen, nor heard of, till <hi>Isidore</hi> brought them out of <hi>Spain:</hi> That no man can tell what <hi>Isidore</hi> made the Book, which is now the President, and the sole Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house of all their Collections, is a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

But you must wink at all this, and believe what <hi>Turrian</hi> says, for the Authority of the Roman Church (which hath seated the Forgeries in the Chair of Judgment) is a greater Argument, to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve her Infallible, than any one Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor can bring against them: <hi>Neither was blessed</hi> Peter <hi>ignorant, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to write to the Dead, nor</hi> Clement, saith he, <hi>when he wrote by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;

but that the Readers would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently see, the Epistle to be written to him, whom all men knew to be dead before</hi> S. Peter; <hi>they being about thereupon, to enquire diligently into the cause thereof, and seeking to find it: Nay, this was the design of the blessed</hi> Peter, <hi>and therein he imitated the Holy Scripture.</hi> Whether to <hi>counterfeit,</hi> or <hi>blaspheme</hi> the Scriptures, be the worse, I cannot tell: but of this I am sure, that they who think such cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses lawful, (as this fastned on S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Holy Scripture here) will stick at nothing which they take for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. For that it was lawful to counterfeit S. <hi>James</hi> his Name, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth afterwards very largely; and now he is giving the reasons of it: One in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was to stir up all people to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry; their admiration at so strange a thing, being very prone to make them diligent to learn the cause of it: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was, that all Bishops might see the more clearly, that they were taught in the person of <hi>James:</hi> For <hi>James</hi> being dead, and uncapable of receiving the instruction, it is evident, that he was not intended thereby; and therefore it must be for others in his capacity.

S. <hi>Peter</hi> vouchsafed (being our Saviours <hi>Vicar,</hi> and <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>) to write to any Bishop alive, the Honour done unto that Bishop had been so great, that all the rest had been tempted to maligne him shrewdly for that advantage: <hi>His intention was,</hi> saith he, <hi>to transfigure</hi>

made an instance in the case; who being called to an Account for offering Incense to an <hi>Idol,</hi> could not be condemned by this Council, and was therefore (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was Pope) humbly implored to condemn himself.</p>
                     <p>It is a Council of great value, because of the President we have in it, how Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may be applied to the Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> and how places that belong to all the World, must peculiarly be ascribed to him alone: Howbeit <hi>Crab</hi> makes a sowre face on't, and is fain to premise this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to the Reader.</p>
                     <p>By reason of the intollerable difference and corruption of the Copies, whereof the one was old and faulty, though written in the best Parchment and Character; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more old, but equally depraved (as the Beholders might discern with their eyes) so far, that what they mean sometimes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be understood, we have set both the Copies, without changing a syllable of them, in two Columns; setting the Letter <hi>A</hi> over the first, and <hi>C</hi> over the other: but the middle Column over which <hi>B</hi> is placed, for its capaeity, or rather conjecture, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours as much as it is able, to reconcile the other two so very divers, and bring them to some sense.</p>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:55872:74"/>
                     <p>He does not tell you plainly, that he made the middle Copy; but 'tis easie to conceive it, since he found but <hi>two,</hi> and they were so full of nonsense, that he added one, which is the third, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them. Yet <hi>Crabbe'</hi>s Invention is now recorded by the <hi>Collectio Regia,</hi> and the two old ones, for their horrid <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismes,</hi> are thrown out of the Councils, and (for very shame) are cast away: for proceeding in his Apology, <hi>Crab</hi> a little after saith, <hi>Nemo ergo caput subsannando moveat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let no man therefore wag his Head in derision, who having either gotten more correct Exemplars, or being of a more Noble and clear apprehension, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to mend these: but rather let him pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently bear with what is done, and reduce it himself into better form.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is a sufficient Light, wherein to see the dissimilitude between Forgeries and true Records: For whereas the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted</hi> were made in great Councils of Holy Men, and are all of them clear and pure, and well-advised, full of Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, Sense, Gravity, Majesty, Smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Order, Perspicuity, Brevity, Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and Verity; it is the common Fare of these Instruments which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse as <hi>Forgeries,</hi> being made in a <hi>Dark</hi>

Age, by men not so Learned as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> could desire, (and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a Corner by some silly Monk) to swarm with Absurdities, Errours, Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologies, Barbarismes; to be rude and tedious, empty and incoherent, weak and impertinent: yet some of them we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to be more pure in Language, and better in sense than others.</p>
                     <p>This Council of <hi>Sinuessa</hi> is more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous than it is possible well to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, before you read and consider it.</p>
                     <p>He has the Counterfeit <hi>Edict of the Emperour Constantine</hi> for a good Record. It is more warily made than the other, and better Latine, but of <hi>Swinging Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance:</hi> 'I is but a Deed of Gift, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the first most Christian Emperour is made to give all the Glory of the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Empire, with its Territories and Regalities, to the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi> We shall meet with it in others: for the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors of the <hi>Decretal</hi> Epistles, all of them, harp upon this String most strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                     <p>As Pope <hi>Paul</hi> V. so <hi>Peter Crab</hi> has but 20 Canons of the <hi>Nicene Council;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he agrees with <hi>Isidore</hi> and <hi>Merlin,</hi> and differs much from some that follow him: Nay, he agrees and disagrees with <hi>Isidore</hi>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:55872:75"/>
at once, in this very thing: He agrees with <hi>Isidore</hi> in his Book it self, (on the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council) but disagrees with him in his <hi>Preface.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But then he maketh amends for the Omission, for he hath the Synodical E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, a <hi>new</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, which I find not in <hi>Isidore,</hi> or in any before him: It is an humble Address of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council to Pope <hi>Sylvester,</hi> beseeching his Holiness to <hi>ratifie</hi> their Decrees: To shew that no Council is of any value, unless it be approved by the Bishop of <hi>Rome:</hi> And he has a Gracious Answer too by the same Pen, or I am sorely deceived; for they are both alike so full of Barbarismes and false Latines, that another Dunce can hardly be found like the first to imitate them. In good earnest, they are the most feculent Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that ever I saw. To speak much in little, is, they are worse than the <hi>Sinuessa</hi> Council.</p>
                     <p>They are without Greek Copies, which (where all the rest is in Greek) is an evil sign: But as they are, you shall have them, when we come to <hi>Binius,</hi> that the more Learned may judge of their Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</p>

                     <p>He defaces and suppresses the sixth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> as well as his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor.</p>

                     <p>Here is a rare case, all the Copies of the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> throughout the World, were <hi>imperfect</hi> 1200 years ago, both among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and among the <hi>Latines,</hi> only those at <hi>Rome</hi> were valid and Authentick. For the Councils of <hi>Carthage</hi> were reckoned among the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> as you may see by <hi>Isidore,</hi> and <hi>Merlin,</hi> placing them in that number, and that justly; for the <hi>African</hi> Fathers that pertained to <hi>Carthage,</hi> wrote in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> as S. <hi>Augustine, Fulgentius, Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, &amp;c.</hi> They were Naturalized so far, that <hi>Latine</hi> was almost their Mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Tongue, as <hi>Justellus</hi> observes out of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine:</hi>

and yet these that were Allied to the See of <hi>Rome</hi> so near, were at one with the <hi>Greeks</hi> in the Records contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: None were good at <hi>Carthage, Constantinople,</hi> or <hi>Alexandria,</hi> &amp;c. but only those which the Pope produced in his own Cause: Nor were any like his upon the Face of the whole Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
                     <p>At first I admired to see those Canons of <hi>Carthage</hi> so abruptly cut off by <hi>Bini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> where I happened first to miss them: but when I afterwards found them, by the help of <hi>Justellus,</hi> I saw the reason: The <hi>Roman Bishop</hi> was curbed; though that of <hi>Anacharsis</hi> concerning Laws pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved true; <hi>Laws are like Spiders Webs, they detain Flies, but Hornets break through them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nicolinus <hi>having intimated the lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and obscurity of the Narration, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on thus:</hi> It is probable that <hi>Celestine</hi> wrote back sharply, and would have the Appeals of Priests, from their own, to the bordering Bishops, and of Bishops them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the <hi>Roman Chair</hi> established and valid. <hi>The Pope would have it so, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all contradiction:</hi> Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they were founded on Right and<note place="margin">Nicol. <hi>ibid.</hi>

                     <p>He gives you more of these audacious <hi>Guesses;</hi> He says <hi>it is credible, that they were contained also among the Canons of</hi> Sardica <hi>which</hi> Celestine <hi>sent, it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unto them: But that the Africans rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not satisfied, either because they suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted those Canons to be corrupted, or for some other cause; it is shewn in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of</hi> Boniface <hi>the</hi> H. <hi>to</hi> Eulalius <hi>of</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,

That there were no Canons of <hi>Sardica</hi> known till the time of <hi>Dionysius Exiguus,</hi> is very probable, because they were not in the <hi>Code of the Vniversal Church,</hi> nor in the <hi>African Code,</hi> till <hi>Dionysius.

                     <p>Whether <hi>Dionysius</hi> or <hi>Hadrian</hi> put them in, is to me uncertain: But <hi>Hadri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> I. first gave the Copy of <hi>Dionysius</hi> to the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> whence the <hi>old Manuscripts</hi> were transcribed, which are now extant in several Libraries; and in which the Dedication of Pope <hi>Hadrian</hi> is contained in Verse, <hi>To his most Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

                     </p>
                     <p>Of GOD he saith nothing here, but his confidence is all in <hi>Peter.</hi> There is not a word like it in all Antiquity: and those words <hi>protecteth and defendeth us,</hi> seem to relate to those Jars that had been before between <hi>Hadrian,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the King, or Emperour.</p>
                     <p>These observations carry me to believe what I met with in <hi>Daille,</hi> since <hi>Dionysius</hi>
                        <pb n="135" facs="tcp:55872:85"/>
is gone from under my hands: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving searched into the Book since, I am further confirmed.</p>
                     <p>About <hi>74</hi> years after the Council of<note place="margin">Daille <hi>pag.</hi> 45. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>Chalcedon, Dionysius Exiguus,</hi> whom we before-mentioned, made his collection at <hi>Rome,</hi> which is since Printed at <hi>Paris, cum Privilegio Regis,</hi> out of very Ancient Manuscripts. Whosoever shall but look di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently into his collection, shall find divers alterations in it; one whereof I shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in, only to shew how Ancient this Artifice hath been among Christians. The last Canon of the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which is the <hi>163</hi> of the <hi>Greek Code</hi> of the Church Universal, forbidding to read in Churches any other Books than those which are Canonical, gives us withal a long Catalogue of them. <hi>Dionysius Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guus,</hi> although he hath indeed inserted in his collection, <hi>Num. 162.</hi> the beginning of the said Canon, which forbiddeth to read any other Books in the Churches, besides the sacred Volumes of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament;</hi> yet hath he wholly omitted the Catalogue, or List of the said Books; fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as I conceive, lest the Tail of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue might scandalize the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A little after he saith,</hi> the <hi>Greek Code</hi> represents unto us <hi>VII</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55872:86"/>
of the first Council of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> which are in like manner found both in <hi>Balsamon,</hi> and in <hi>Zonoras,</hi> and also in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Edition of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils, Printed at <hi>Rome.</hi> The three last of these do not appear at all in the <hi>Latine Code</hi> of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> though they are very considerable ones, as to the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness they relate to, which is the order of proceeding, in passing judgment upon Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops accused, and in receiving such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who forsaking their communion with Hereticks, desire to be admitted into the Church. It is very hard to say, what should move the Collector to Gueld this Council thus: But this I am very well assured of, that in the sixth Canon, which is one of those he hath omitted, and which treateth of judging of Bishops accused, there is not the least mention made of <hi>Appealing to Rome;</hi> nor of any <hi>Reserved Cases,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is not permitted to any, save only to the Pope, to judge a Bishop: The power of hearing and determining all such matters being here wholly and absolutely referred to the Provincial Synods, and to their Dio cesans.</p>

                     <p>His contempt of the Fathers appears in his <hi>Printer to the Reader:</hi> for by one of <hi>Turrian's Transfigurations,</hi> he covers
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55872:89"/>
that <hi>Admonition</hi> with the Printers Name, though too Learned for any Printer, and evident enough to be his <hi>own:</hi> for he there unfoldeth the matter, order and use of the Work, far above a Printers reach; and especially notes its <hi>Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Emendations</hi> to us: which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth to four Heads.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>To the observation of the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Councils were held, and under what Pope.</hi> Whereupon we note, the manner of ordering the Councils <hi>under such and such a Pope,</hi> seemeth a new thing: <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> else arrogates too much to himself, in ascribing this to his own Invention. Certainly the custom of <hi>computing times by the Popes Lives,</hi> is of no long standing, but an Artisice lately taken up by his Flatterers, to dazle the eyes of their Readers; for it adds much to the Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the Chair, to see Kings and Councils marshalled under the <hi>Reign,</hi> as it were, of this, and that, and the other Pope, down from S. <hi>Clement,</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Ages. But from the beginning it was not so.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>To the truth of History and Actions: As when various Authors are often cited, either for the confirmation of Sentences, or to show the variety that is among Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55872:89"/>
or to reprehend some falsity, Quod interdam, parcè tamen, &amp; timidé feci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> In his Dedicatory Epistle he told the Pope, <hi>that he did nothing perversty, but all things most rightly and clearly, as far as was possible, according to their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Candour:</hi> As you see before. But here he confesseth, the business of repie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving falshoods to be a tender work, which he went about with great caution and trembling. Some he detected, but <hi>timerousiy and sparingly:</hi> he durst not meddle with them all.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>To the consutation of some contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and rebellions persons; who lay hold on the lightest occasions, and oftentimes wrest the plainest matters, to the disgrace of the H. Roman Church. As when from a slight contention of the African Fathers, about Appeals to the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>they foreibly conclude against the very truth of the Acts, and the Faith of the History, that those Fathers did not acknowledge but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse its Primacy over them.</hi> In the Body of his Tomes, he <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> Epistles of <hi>Boniface</hi> and <hi>Eulalius,</hi> as good Records, testifying the Excommunication of all the African Churches by the Pope; yet here he calleth it a light contention: Himself wresteth the plainest matters for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55872:90"/>
against the very truth of the Acts, and chargeth the fault on the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants: For in this very place he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the African Fathers did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse the Primacy of <hi>Rome,</hi> but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge its Supremacy, or its <hi>Primacy over them.</hi> Yet it all this but a Copy of his countenance, a common flourish in the Frontispiece of their work: For if they submitted to the Popes <hi>Primacy over them,</hi> why should they be Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? He knows well enough, when we come close to the matter, that these <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions Protestants,</hi> and those <hi>Catholick Fathers,</hi> were of the same judgment, and acted the same thing. By way of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion therefore he addeth, that <hi>this was far from the mind of those Fathers; but if they had conceived so, it would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded to their Infamy, and not at all have tended to the lessening of the Supreme Authority of the Roman Church, ordained and established by God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two hundred and seventeen Bishops in an ancient approved Council, even the <hi>sixth Council of Carthage,</hi> protested a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Popes</hi> Supreme Authority, <hi>to their perpetual Infamy;</hi> as <hi>Nicolinus</hi> would have it: for should all the Bishops in the World joyn together, they would but
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55872:90"/>
dash themselves against that <hi>Rock,</hi> and do things <hi>to their Infamy,</hi> and there's an end. This is the value which Papists have for the Councils and Fathers, when they stand in their way: And this Impudence comes abroad by the consent of <hi>Nicolinus,</hi> and the Pope, without <hi>Blushing.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Because the voluntary Breakers of the Canons are heavily censured by the H. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and condemned by the H. Ghost, by whose Gift and Inspiration they were dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Because they do not unfitly seem to blaspheme the H. Ghost, who being not compelled by any necessity, but willingly (as was before said) either do any thing perversly, or presume to speak against the same Holy Canons, or consent to them that will; for such a presumption is manifestly one kind of blaspheming the H. Ghost: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (as was even now promised) it acteth

against him, by whose grace and impulse the same Holy Canons were set forth. But the wickedness of the Devil is wont to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive many, and so doth very oftentinies delude the imprudence of some by a simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Piety, that he perswadeth them to take hurtful things for healthful.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>These therefore being rightly considered, and upon our deliberation brought to the knowledge of your Churches, it most highly becometh you to obey the Rules of the same H. Canons, lest the sloth of some should make them in any thing to walk contrary to them. But let your wise and wholesome Doctrine, which desires you in all things to please God, shew them these faithful Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workmen in their Thrones, the coheirs and partakers of the Coelestial Kingdom.

                     <p>The close of the Epistle (is not clear nonsense) is very obscure. The meaning of it is, that <hi>Aurelius</hi> should shew men the Decretal Epistles of <hi>Clement, Anacle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, &amp;c. those faithful Fellow-workmen in their Thrones, the coheirs and partakers of the Coelestial Kingdom,</hi> that are now in Heaven, to the intent they may obey them, and come to the same Eternal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. A goodly design doubtless. But we have a cross proverb, <hi>

We have a more sacred saying, <hi>In the Pit which he made for others, is himself fallen.</hi> And it is not impertinent: for while he chargeth others with the unpardonable sin, himself <hi>blasphemes the Holy <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</hi> For to make the Holy Ghost the <hi>Father of Lies,</hi> is (I think) to blaspheme him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Damasus,</hi> we confess, never made the Epistle; but that makes the matter worse. Some other in <hi>Damasus</hi> his Coat, is guilty of this accursed business; that while he Fathers the Frauds, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self invented, on the H. Ghost, has not <hi>ignorance</hi> to <hi>excuse,</hi> but <hi>malice</hi> to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn</hi> him. And whether the Forgeries
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55872:95"/>
are not so Fathered still on the Holy Ghost, may be a proper Question. <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> I think, was afraid of these Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nicolinus</hi> in his <hi>Printer to the Reader,</hi> pretendeth an exact <hi>observation of the time, under what Pope</hi> things were done: but for once he varies the method, and sets this in the Front of the Forgeries, to countenance all.</p>
                     <p>He knows them perhaps to be what they are, yet clearly owns them.</p>
                     <p>There is some Errour in the date of these Epistles; an usual Symptom of the Disease in such Instruments. Instead of the XVI. <hi>Kal. Jun. Nicolinus</hi> putteth it the XI. Some hidden reason compels him, or he would never be so nice: for <hi>Cyricius, Siricius</hi> a small mistake: But the next is greater, for <hi>Gratian, Equitius.</hi> As if <hi>Damasus</hi> the Pope could not tell who was <hi>Consul</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> when he wrote his Letter.</p>
                     <p>I wonder at <hi>Damasus</hi> for one thing much; he tells us of <hi>the wickedness of the Devil, who deludes men with a shew of Piety,</hi> and forces in that expression of the <hi>Devils perswading men to take hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things for healthful</hi> so affectedly, that it would make one to think his Guilt put
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55872:95"/>
him in memory of such a saying. But his design in charging all that impugn them, with the dreadful and unpardonable sin of blaspheming the Holy Ghost, was more clearly to deter men from writing or speaking against these pretended Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons. And perhaps he declaims against <hi>the wickedness of others, that delude the imprudence of some with a similitude of Piety;</hi> and so loudly inveigheth against the Guilt of <hi>perswading men to take hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things for healthful,</hi> to remove the suspition from himself. Whatever tis, no man is more guilty of the Fraud in the World.</p>
                     <p>You may note a contradiction in the Letter: The Canons of the H. Fathers, and Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> were <hi>consecrated by the Reverence of the whole World;</hi> and yet upon <hi>Aurelius</hi> his desire, were newly <hi>brought to the knowledge of the Churches,</hi> and now first ordered to be <hi>published and preached.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They past the <hi>deliberation</hi> of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Damasus</hi> before they came abroad, <hi>being rightly considered, and upon due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation brought to the knowledge of the Churches.</hi> Doubtless they were well weighed, and what was most agreeable to the <hi>Roman Chair</hi> was pickt out, and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen for the purpose.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>SEverinus Binius,</hi> a late Collector of the Councils, is grown so famous, that his Voluminous Tomes have been Printed thrice; he is approved by an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> V. inserted among other Instruments before his Work, and so highly esteemed, that he is exactly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by <hi>Labbe</hi> and <hi>Cossartius</hi> in 17 Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, and taken in, word for word, by the COLLECTIO REGIA; lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by the care of a King in 37 Tomes.</p>
                     <p>The reason why they follow <hi>Binius</hi> so exactly, the <hi>Collectio Regia</hi> giveth in <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> words, set next to the Title-page of the Book, for our better information. <hi>We thought fit to follow the last collection of the councils put forth by</hi> Binius, <hi>and illustrated with his Notes; and to Print it <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>, as that which of all others is most richly stored.</hi> Wherein they have
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55872:96"/>
done <hi>Binius</hi> as great Honour as one can well imagine: for it shews his Notes to be the best and most convenient that can be gotten in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that all the Collectors since (which were very many) have not been able to devise better.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon it followeth, that in one Work we may the more concisely treat of <hi>Binius, Labbe, Cossartius,</hi> and the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectio Regia</hi> together.</p>
                     <p>I once intended to give you a Copy of the Popes approbation, with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Authorities by which <hi>Binius</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; but as the case <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> it is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous.</p>
                     <p>He pretendeth in <hi>Preface, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

But his <hi>Notes</hi> are <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> and inconsiderable Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and those his acknowledgments hidden from a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:55872:97"/>
                     <p>In his Letter to <hi>Paul</hi> V. he layeth all his Labours at the Popes Feet. So that we are like to have good on't, when the Malefactor (accused) is made sole Lord and Judge of the Witnesses.</p>
                     <p>He hath several Prefaces to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to Persons of the Highest Rank and Splendour: in which he pretends to magnifie the Decrees and Canons follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as good Records.</p>
                     <p>He prefixeth <hi>Isidore'</hi>s Counterfeit <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> before his Collection.</p>
                     <p>Over the Canons of the Apostles, in a Splendid manner, he sets this Title.</p>
                     <p>THE CANONS OF THE HOLY APOSTLES WITH ALL VENERATION TO BE FOLLOWED.</p>
                     <p>According to The Ancient Edition OF <hi>DIONYSIVS EXIGVVS.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A man would think now there should no more <hi>Canons</hi> be laid down, than <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55872:97"/>
Exiguus</hi> hath in his Ancient Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But as if he intended to bear the Mark of the Beast in his Forehead, he puts under this Title <hi>eighty four Canons of the Apostles,</hi> whereas <hi>Dionysius</hi> hath but 50. Certainly 'tis not well done so to Cheat his Reader with a Lye; but in some blind Corner or other he will make us satisfaction.</p>
                     <p>Over against this he puts a Note in the Margin, thus: Francis Turrian, <hi>of the Society of</hi> Jesus, <hi>hath published a very clear Book in Defence of the Apostles Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.</hi> He approveth the Book, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth two of the Canons which <hi>Turrian</hi> defendeth: but that is concealed till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
                     <p>It is his custom, in the top of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Chapters and Margins, eminent and conspicuous places, to put Notes or Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, defending those Counterfeit Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, which in some little Gloss hidden in the Text, he really slighteth: For the Potentates of the World, with their Lords and Councellors, not having time enough to search into the bottom, may by such means as these neatly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; while they think no man so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, as in the same Leaf, to contradict his <hi>pretences.</hi> So that the very greatness
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55872:98"/>
of the Crime is their greatest security.</p>
                     <p>Another Artifice like this, is that of putting the Preface of <hi>Dionysius Exiguus</hi> before these Tomes of his own, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to countenance the ensuing Frauds. Though <hi>Dionysius</hi> were dead 1000 years before he wrote them, and never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor thought of the greater part of them.</p>
                     <p>But Lyars are intangled always in the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>: what is convenient in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, being inconvenient in another.</p>
                     <p>For in that his Preface, <hi>Dionysius</hi> speaking for himself, saith only this: <hi>In the beginning we have placed those Canons which are said to be the Apostles, transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of</hi> Greek: <hi>which because the most do not easily acknowledge, I thought meet to acquaint your Holiness with the same.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He doubts them all you see; yet speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth only of his own fifty, which he hath in the Code which himself digested: He does not meddle with those that make up the number of 84. no more than <hi>Isidere</hi> and <hi>

                     <p>Nay <hi>Einius</hi> himself, you will see pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, rejected some; and yet here he pretendeth the whole number to be written, both by <hi>Clement</hi> in Greek, and by <hi>Dionysius</hi> in Latine: For of all his Catalogue, he faith, <hi>These Canons,</hi> &amp;c. Clement <hi>of</hi> Rome, S. Peter's <hi>Disciple, wrote in Greek, and</hi> Dionysius <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>an Abbot in</hi> Rome, <hi>translated them into Latine;</hi> as if it were not sufficient to write a Lye in the Front, unless he clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up the Canons with a Lye in the Tail.</p>
                     <p>It would be worth the Enquiry to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:55872:99"/>
know where they had the 34. which were unknown to the Ancient <hi>Dionysius?</hi> For after all this, he seems to reject them in the passage following.</p>
                     <p>Horum quinquaginta priores, <hi>&amp;c. saith he,</hi> Only the first fifty of these (the last of which is of dipping thrice in Baptism) containing nothing but sound Apostolical Doctrine, and approved by Ancient Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Councils, and Fathers, are received as Authentick, <hi>Cap. 3. Dist. 16.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that common Rule of the Holy Fathers, because the Author of them is unknown, they are rightly believed to flow unto us by Apostolical Tradition. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue by Pope <hi>Gelasius, Can. Sanct. Dist. 15.</hi> are accounted Apocryphal, both because their Author is unknown, as also because by the 65 and the last Canon, it is evident, that some of them are craftily put in by the Grecians, and some of them corrupted by Hereticks.</p>
                     <p>This passage deserves one or two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Observations.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If the Tradition of the Apostles, though committed to <hi>writing,</hi> be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of corruption; what security can we have of <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> which is far more loose, and liable to danger?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:55872:99"/>
to secure the <hi>Apostles Canons</hi> from the Leven of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and other <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi> or so careless, as not to keep one Copy, or Record <hi>sincere;</hi> what assurance can we have of her care and ability in the residue? This shews the weakness of these inconvenient Shifts, and pitiful <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>But the reason why some are <hi>received as Authentick,</hi> and others <hi>accounted <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> is most fit to be marked. The reason why it is highly to be presumed, that the first 50 Canons should be <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Because the Author of them is unknown:</hi> And the reason why the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due are rejected, is, <hi>Because the Author of them is unknown.</hi> So that the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (as Fire hardens Clay, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Wax) will prove contrary things. And by reasoning in such a Latitude, it will be easie to prove the Sun <hi>black,</hi> and the Sky a Molehill.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit for these reasons, <hi>Gelasius</hi> an Ancient Pope rejecteth some of them: But <hi>Binius</hi> takes the liberty to put his judgment in the other end of the Scale; and outfacing us with a Counterfeit <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and Pretended <hi>Dionysius,</hi> will have all but two, to be Authentick Canons: All but two; namely, <hi>the 65. and the last Canon; by which it is evident, that some
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:55872:100"/>
of them are crastily put in by the Grecians, and some of them corrupted by Hereticks.</hi> Some of them <hi>put in</hi> by the Grecians, must at least be two; and some of them <hi>corrupted</hi> by Hereticks, must at least be two more; yet they are all of them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept two, Authentick.</p>
                     <p>Let his reason be what it will, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, 1. That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is in a tottering condition, when a poor Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of <hi>Collein</hi> shall take upon him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel the Sentence of an <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

reasons. <hi>Quia tamen ex his posterioribus ferè omnes praeter praedictos duos,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But because all these latter almost, besides the two forementioned, are either by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Roman Bishops, or by the Decrees of other Councils, or by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of some Fathers, confirmed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, as is manifest by these our Margi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and Annotations: (So that it may not lightly or rashly he doubted, whether they were taken hence by the Bishops, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and Fathers, or rather translated hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and put here out of their Writings:) Hereupon they may and ought rightly and deservedly all, except the two excepted, to be taken for Authentick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How perplexed his discourse is, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you see. His courage fails in the midst, and it becomes thereupon so rough and difficult, that it is scarce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible. The occasion of its Incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is that Parenthesis (thrust into the middle.) For <hi>Binius</hi> foreseeing a strong Obiection to the Discourse he was going to make, claps it Sophistically into the midst of his Argument; hoping there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, that it would never more be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted upon him: Which you may easily see, both by the Nature of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by the resolution of his words.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55872:101"/>
For his Argument is this; which if you lay aside the Answer to it, runs smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Almost all these latter Canons, besides the two forementioned, are either by the Authority of Roman Bishops, or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of other Councils, or the Sentences of some Fathers, confirmed and approved (:) hereupon they may and ought rightly and deservedly, all except the two except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to be taken for Authentick.</hi> Now the Answer is the <hi>Parenthesis</hi> in the midst. Certain Sentences like to these Canons are in the Fathers writings, but so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained there, <hi>that it may not lightly or rashly be doubted, whether they were taken hence by the Bishops, Councils, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or rather translated hither, and put here out of their Writings. To doubt a thing rashly</hi> is nonsense; but it may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be feared, that these Canons are Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences pickt out of other Books, and packt into a Body, bearing the name of the <hi>Apostles Canons.</hi> His Conscience did convict him, and he replieth not a word, though it be an important consideration in the case.</p>
                     <p>But there is a worse fault in his <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick;</hi> he argues from <hi>Particulars</hi> to <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversals:</hi> for having said, <hi>Fere omnes praeter praedictos duos,</hi> he comes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55872:101"/>
                        <hi>Omnes praeter praedictos duos.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all except two are approved, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all except two are Authentick.</p>
                     <p>Such Tricks as these he hath often: And sometimes affects an obscure kind of speaking, on purpose to blind the Reader; especially when he is intangled with some difficult Argument: He then Clouds himself, like the <hi>Cuttle,</hi> in his own <hi>Ink,</hi> that he might vomit up the <hi>Hook</hi> in the dark, and scape away.</p>
                     <p>He might have produced a General Council, if he pleased, to confirm all the 84 Canons, and that <hi>under the Name of the Apostles too,</hi> which had been more to the purpose: but then he must have confessed the last Canon of <hi>Clement</hi> to be true, and consequently that his eight Books of Constitutions, and his two E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles, are part of the Bible; or else that the Decree of the Council, confirming these, was <hi>Spurious;</hi> or else of necessity, that the Pope and Council did <hi>err.</hi> But he had more kindness for the Pope than so, and therefore perhaps let the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil alone.</p>
                     <p>He would inure you by his words to believe that Popes are equal to Councils. <hi>Because they are,</hi> saith he, <hi>either by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Roman Bishops, or other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55872:102"/>
or some Fathers confirmed, they may and ought to be taken for Authentick. Some Fathers</hi> is a dwindling expression: He very well knows that 217 were reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in the sixth Council of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage. Roman Bishops,</hi> and <hi>other Councils,</hi> are words of some weight: But what can <hi>other Councils</hi> do, if the <hi>Roman Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> please to reject them? The <hi>Roman Bishops,</hi> and <hi>other Councils,</hi> are so put in contradistinction, that the Authority of <hi>Roman Bishops</hi> is set before that of <hi>other Councils:</hi> And perhaps the proportion being observed, the <hi>Roman Bishops</hi> must be thought as far above <hi>other Councils,</hi> as <hi>other Councils</hi> above <hi>some Fathers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In other places they affirm a Pope with his Council to be Infallible: Here, that <hi>the Roman Bishop is a Council:</hi> Otherwise it is nonsense to say, <hi>The Roman Bishops, or other Councils.</hi> The Roman Bishop hath a Council in himself: And indeed it is requisite, that he of all other should be the greatest Council, when standing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, he is to judge of a Council, and to determine, even whether an <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Council shall be approved, or disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
                     <p>This is a Tast of <hi>Binius,</hi> an Elephants Clee, a Scrap of five large Volumes,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55872:102"/>
full of the same integrity and perverse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p>The swelling words which they talk of, <hi>approved</hi> and <hi>disapproved Councils,</hi> are all to be understood, of Councils appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or disapproved by the Roman Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.</p>
                     <p>From his Canons we proceed to his Council: for <hi>Binius</hi> hath a Council of Apostles too, on a Prodigious Theme! the setting up of Images. It is but a short one, and hath but one Canon, and that is the <hi>eighth.</hi> It is set forth in this form.</p>

                     <p>The first Authority he hath to prove it, is the 2 <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, 800 years almost after the Apostles. And he col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteth it thence by a blind conjecture, not by any evident Assertion of theirs.</p>
                     <p>Besides this he citeth one <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> who testifieth that he found it in <hi>Origen'</hi>s Study, as <hi>Turrian</hi> saith against the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Magdenburg.</hi> So that all this rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon <hi>Turrian,</hi> an impudent Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the World hath any. Where we first observe, that <hi>Origen</hi> had no Images himself, neither adored any. 2. That I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages were forbidden in the H. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, especially in the Old Testament. 3. The Apostles were wont to allure the Jews, and not to offend them. <hi>To the Jews,</hi> saith S. Paul, <hi>I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews.</hi> Whereas to set up Images, was the only way to drive them out of the Temple. 4. That all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Councils, <hi>Nice, Constantinople, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus, Chalcedon, Arles, Eleberis, Antioch, Laodicea, Sardis, Jerusalem, Alexandria,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55872:103"/>
Rome,</hi> &amp;c. during all the time of 800 years, were silent of this Apostolical Canon.</p>
                     <p>Concerning which, I beseech you to consider further: 1. That admitting it were in the 2 <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, that was an Idolatrons Council, addicted to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and full of Forgeries; for which it is rejected by all the knowing and soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of the World. 2. The Apostles were not obeyed in this Commandment, neither in their own Age, nor in divers Ages after. 3. <hi>Binius</hi> himself seemeth conscious of its unsoundness, for he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it not among the Councils of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, which are before their Canons altogether, but in another place strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by it self, in his own Notes, and after the Apostles Canons. 4. Since the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles wrote in Greek, this is rendered suspitious by wanting a Greek Copy. 5. No Collector produceth one word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides himself, in the whole Circuit of the first 400 years, on the behalf of Images. 6. The Fathers unanimously write against Images in the Church of GOD. 7. You may perceive by the dulness of the Sense out of what Storehouse this Fragment came, and by the horrid incongruity of <hi>making a Divine and Humane Image un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55872:104"/>
with hands:</hi> The Divinity and and Humanity being Natures infinitely distant, cannot be painted in the same Picture. But for want of a better, this Musty Evidence must serve the turn.</p>

                     <p>As for Binius, who defendeth <hi>the first Epistle of</hi> Clement <hi>to S.</hi> James for a good Record; if he did read the Epistle, and

note what he read, he was a false man for defending it against his Judgment and Conscience. He that so mortally ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>the Itinerary of Clement,</hi> could not but know the <hi>Epistle</hi> to be Forged, if he read it with any diligent observation: If he trusted others, he was an unwise man, to be so confident in maintaining it, upon the report of those that read and transcribed it for him: For their inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency hath deceived him.</p>
                     <p>For S. <hi>Clement</hi> himself (if that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle be his) owneth the Forgery of S. <hi>Clement'</hi>s <hi>Itinerary,</hi> which Binius so extremely abhorreth. It must needs be a Forgery therefore, because in this case, nothing but a Forgery can defend a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery: no Author (if a Saint) acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging those Forgeries for his, which he never made.</p>
                     <p>After a long Oration which S. <hi>Clement</hi> fendeth to S. <hi>James,</hi> in that Epistle out of S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s mouth, concerning the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Excellency of the Roman Chair, he has these words, speaking of S. <hi>Peter.</hi>

                        <hi>Binius</hi> is not able to name the time wherein the Discipline of the Church was (in this respect) corrupted so, as to need the Reformation pretended.</p>

He sate nineteen years, four moneths, and three days, in the times of</hi> Antoninus Pius. Hermes <hi>his own Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wrote a book, in which a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was contained, given him by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord, coming to him in the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of a Shepherd, that</hi> Easter <hi>should be observed on the Lords Day.

                     <p>This <hi>Hermes,</hi> saith <hi>Binius,</hi> in his Notes on the place, <hi>is the same whom S.</hi> Paul <hi>mentioneth in his Epistle to the</hi> Romans. <hi>Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trobus, Hermes,</hi> &amp;c. He was at Mans E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:55872:116"/>
when S. <hi>Paul</hi> saluted him, and a very old man sure for a Writer of Books in the time of <hi>Pius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Binius</hi> is not willing to have him so obscure as a Shepherd, but faith, <hi>He was called</hi> Pastor, <hi>either because he was of the Family of</hi> Junius Pastor, <hi>who in the third year of</hi> Aurelian <hi>was Consul, or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, because the Angel appeared to him in the form of a Shepherd.</hi> In this his Guess he is upon the brink of rejecting the Pontifical. Howbeit he quits it not of a Lye: for instead of nineteen years which the Pontifical giveth him, <hi>Binius</hi> faith, <hi>he sate but nine years.</hi> A small mistake in this Learned Pontifical.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Book which <hi>Hermes</hi> the Shepherd wrote, he saith, <hi>It was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most unknown among the Latines, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry famous among the Greeks:</hi> Which was very strange, considering he was the <hi>Popes Brother:</hi> A Book made by so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a person, and so near home, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known among the Latines!</hi> But his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is perhaps, it was better known than trusted. For a little after he saith, <hi>The Latines esteemed it Apocryphal as</hi> Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, Athanasius, <hi>and</hi> Prosper <hi>witness, and as</hi> Gelasius <hi>decreed;</hi> Can. Sanct. Dift. 15.</p>
                     <p>Now because their unmannerliness
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55872:117"/>
doth refiect a little upon the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who in his Decretal Epistle annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, owns his Brother with an Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mention of the Angelical Vision; <hi>Binius</hi> to display more Learning on the behalf of the <hi>Pontifical,</hi> and <hi>Pius</hi> his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal,</hi> tells you; that <hi>the Book of the true</hi> Hermes Pastor, <hi>praised so much by</hi> Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, Origen, Athanasius, Eusebius, Jerome, &amp;c. <hi>is not now Extant. Which is evident</hi> (he saith) <hi>because in that we now have, there is no Mention at all of Easter. Nay the Author of it saith, he was admonished to deliver it to</hi> Clement <hi>the Pope, by whom it was to be sent to forreign Cities.</hi> They have as good Luck at <hi>Rome,</hi> as if they held Intelligence with <hi>Purgatorie.</hi> The <hi>Dead</hi> and <hi>they</hi> have as intimate a Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence, as if the Pope knew the Way to send his <hi>Bulls</hi> thither. Here is another Forgerie detected, by its Dedication to <hi>S. Clement</hi> who by no unusual Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is served just in his own kind, for he disturbed <hi>S. James,</hi> and another dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbes him, in his <hi>Crave.</hi> Yet <hi>Binius</hi> is very much inclined to this Opinion, for from hence he gathereth, it was <hi>longè ante haec Tempora Scriptus, a Book written long before the time of</hi> Pius. As no doubt it must, if it be not the same that was
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55872:117"/>
praised by <hi>Tertullian, Origen, Athanasius, &amp;c.</hi> For all Forgeries must be old and True, or they are not worth a farthing.</p>
                     <p>But how comes <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, &amp;c.</hi> to esteem it Apocryphal, and yet to praise it so much, in the same <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>? It is <hi>Binius</hi> his Breath, not theirs. They poor men are made like <hi>Stage players</hi> to say whatsoever the Poet listeth. Or else as <hi>Binius</hi> observes there were two Books of <hi>Hermes</hi> (though it be double dealing thus to have two of a Sort:) the one right, and the other <hi>Apocryphal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But then <hi>Gelasius</hi> did very ill, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two of a Sort, to condemn the one, and not tell us of the other. And so did <hi>Ivo.</hi> For this <hi>Pastor</hi> is one of the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue we told you of in the Beginning.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Binius</hi> has a fetch beyond this; He teaches you a way, how to take <hi>both</hi> these persons for the <hi>same</hi> man: and what you may say in defence of your self, if you so do. <hi>However</hi> (saith he) <hi>if any one be disposed to take them for the same Author, Ex Sententiâ Illustriss. Card.</hi> Barona <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendum est,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He must necessarily say, as</hi> Baronius <hi>gives his Opinion, that they were two commentaries, written at divers times where of the first was more famous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Greeks the later more obscure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55872:118"/>
the Latines.</hi> A brave Antithesis! So that upon the point the <hi>Latines</hi> had none. <hi>The more obscure among the Latines</hi> was <hi>obscure</hi> every where; <hi>the more famous among the Greeks</hi> and <hi>the more obscure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Latines!</hi> The <hi>Antathesis</hi> makes a shew of giving you some So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid matter, but when you grasp it in your hand, it turnes to Air. Unless per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will learn thereby, that the more obscure among the Latines was a Book made in an instant, by a meer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture and a pretty Mockery to gull the Reader, as a shadow at least of some proof that the Pontifical and the Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are not Lyars.</p>
                     <p>Among other Things their Allowances are considerable: for they are good honest reasonable men, and will let you think what you will of the Book, so you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the main, and believe <hi>the Popes Supremacy.</hi> And next that, their Art of Instruction is to be weighed, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be true or no, no matter: If the <hi>Disciple</hi> can but defend himself by a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, and escape the Conviction of an Absurdity, it is enough; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is at such <hi>Dicendums</hi> often. Though 'tis a Secret among themselves, they teach their Disciples <hi>What to say,</hi> not <hi>What is</hi> True.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55872:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But I thought we had been agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that of these <hi>Hermes</hi> at least was a Forgerie.</p>
                     <p>It seems. by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> his Letter, that <hi>Hermes</hi> was a <hi>Doctor,</hi> and not a <hi>Shepherd, for in these Days,</hi> he saith, <hi>Hermes a Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the faith, and of the</hi> H. <hi>scriptures shined among us.</hi> Not of old, but <hi>in these Days.</hi> Yet it is pretended, that the Book of old was by some order from on high, to be <hi>delivered to Clement the Pope, by whom it was to be sent to forreign Cities.</hi> Notwithstanding all their Contrivance, there Wit failes them sometimes, that are so accustomed to Lying. They have so many Irons in the fire that some of them miscarry, whether they will or no.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheless <hi>that Hermes received this Commandment from the Angel Tertullian witnesseth, in his third Book of verses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Mareion</hi> saith <hi>Binius.</hi> I have not heard much of <hi>Tertullian's Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</hi> I have his Works, put forth with the Notes of <hi>Beatus Rhenanus,</hi> and cannot find any such <hi>verses</hi> among them. If he hath? all that <hi>Binius</hi> pretendeth out of them, is that <hi>Hermes spake Angelical Words;</hi> Therefore he saw the Angel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pius</hi> in his Decretal Epistle applieth this Scripture, <hi>Not holding the Head from
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55872:119"/>
which all the body by joynts and bands having nourishment ministred, and knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, increaseth with the increase of God,</hi>] to the Pope of <hi>Rome. Whereupon,</hi> he saith, <hi>We instruct you all by our Apostolical authority, that you ought to observe the same Commandments, because we also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the same. And ye ought not by any means to divide from the Head.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Commandment was given to <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi> by an Angel. Whereupon Pope <hi>Pius</hi> after the first complement, beginneth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unluckily with <hi>forbidding the Religion or worshipping of Angels.</hi> Whereas upon this occasion some eminent matter ought to have been spoken concerning Angels. But because of the words following, he puts them together. <hi>Let no man beguile</hi>

Where he taketh off the <hi>Eternal</hi> Head, and puts a <hi>New</hi> one on the Churches shoulders. <hi>For in these dayes</hi> Hermes <hi>a Doctor of the Faith and of the Holy Scriptures shined among us: And though we observed Easter on the foresaid day, yet because some doubted, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of their Souls, an Angel of the Lord appeared to the same</hi> Hermes <hi>in the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55872:119"/>
shape of a Shepheard, and commanded him that the Passeover should be celebrated by all on the Lords day: Whereupon we also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct you all by our Apostolical authority, that you ought to observe the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> (Not because an Angel brought them, or GOD sent him; but) <hi>Because we also observe the same, and ye ought not by any means to divide from the Head.</hi> And because the business is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Apostolical Authority above all the Angels, instead of extolling and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying them, which had been the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral method on such a Topick: as if he would enervate the evidence of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, he biddeth them <hi>take heed,</hi> and that <hi>diligently, least any one seduce you, by any Astrology, or Philosophy, or vain Fallacy, according to the tradition of men: after the Rudiments of this World, and not after Christ's and true Tradition.</hi> As if no more heed were to be given to an <hi>Angel,</hi> than to an Asse, unless the <hi>Pope</hi> first approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Vision: Nor is Philosophy, nor the Tradition of men, nor any thing else to be valued in opposition to him, and his <hi>true Tradition; for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily: that ye may be repleat in him, who is the Head of all Principality and Power, and who bath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

this Apostolical See, to be the Head of all Churches, saying to the Prince of the Apostles, Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock will I build my Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What it is to walk <hi>after Christ and true Tradition,</hi> you may see Cleerly, by this Glos, upon our Saviours Text. They that do not <hi>hold the Head, from which all the Body by Joynts and Bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God,</hi> are in extream peril of damnation. And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour who is <hi>the Head of all</hi> Principality <hi>and</hi> Power, hath commanded this Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical See to be the Head of all Churches; Therefore, Whosoever holdeth not to this Head is in extream peril of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. For the Pope is not the Head of all Principality and Power <hi>in himself,</hi> but only by Derivation he is made the Head, &amp;c. And consequently, 'tis as necessary to cleave unto him as to <hi>Christ</hi> himself.

                     <p>It is a Cross Observation to note the little Authority of the Popes <hi>Custome.

Neither do they fasten it on the <hi>Donatists,</hi> but the <hi>Papists.</hi> For though <hi>Marcellinus</hi> be made a <hi>Donatist</hi> in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his Confession being founded on that Doctrine, that no man guilty of mortal sin, can (though penitent) continue in the Order of Priests: <hi>Binius</hi> himself puts the Doctrine into his mouth: while other <hi>Doctrines</hi> relating to the Popes Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,

and other <hi>Persons</hi> defending this Council, shew plainly enough whose it is, notwithstanding the present <hi>Mist</hi> which <hi>Binius</hi> putteth before our eyes. Hear him on.</p>
                     <p>But if no fear of the Persecution of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius, saith he,</hi> could hinder them, but that about sifty years before this, as we said in our Notes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Council held in the Interregnum, many Bishops of the Remoter Provinces, and many others neighbouring on <hi>Italy,</hi> and living in hanishment, came together upon the Letters of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, at <hi>Rome,</hi> and holding a Council there, ordained those things, which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent necessity of the Church did require: Why should it seem more distant from the truth, that by the most vigilant care of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, the Bishops of Forreign Churches should be called together by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Epistles, and no fear or Danger of Life deterring them, meet at the time and place appointed, to transact and decide that cause, of all other the most deplorable, in which not only the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but the whole Christian Religion was brought into the greatest Hazard, wherein the whole Foundation of the Church was shaken, in the first Bishop of the Catholick Faith, and almost utterly overthrown?</p>

For it cannot be rejected without Prejudice to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Roman Chair.</hi> Which as it clears

                     </p>
                     <p>For though it be more than probable, that some pitiful barren Head, void of all Sence and Learning, did at first compose it, out of the affection he had to the See of <hi>Rome:</hi> Yet as in Treason all are Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals, so here <hi>the Receiver is as bad as the Thief.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Church by aiding and abetting this Abomination, hath made it her own: Be it forged in what empty Shop it will, she hath magnified it to the Stars, by fixing it in her <hi>Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rologies:</hi> The Chair is defiled with the Forgery it hath adopted: and the Pope hath made it as much his, as if it had been the Issue of his own Brain.</p>
                     <p>Being therefore it cannot now be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, without discovering the <hi>shameful secrets</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church; Binius</hi> like a good Son endeavours to maintain it: but with such ill success, that he shames her more by miscarrying in the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</p>

He might say, it was <hi>put in</hi> without all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, because the <hi>Roman Martyrologies</hi> and Breviaries were works of Darkness, made in Secret by the Popes Authority: But is it <hi>maintained</hi> without all controversie, when <hi>exceeding many of the most Learned Men endeavour to prove its Acts to be Spurious by strong Arguments?</hi> Does <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralle Antiquity it self fight sharply for them, compelling a Beverence from the unwilling by its Majesty; or is it by the

and not prejudicating any mans Sentence by our Opinion.</hi> His Reason why it may be held for a good and true Record, is the safety of the Roman Chair not with stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it should be thought so. And one of the Reasons why we so greatly suspect them, is that very behaviour: The advantage of the <hi>Roman</hi> See being the only Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone among them, of Records and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries. By this very example you see, that men as wise as <hi>Binius</hi> leave the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Doubtful; and by his Testimony you find that many <hi>Romanists</hi> renounce it: So may you discern by the Crookedness of their Rule, that they are fit to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. It is a very great Secret and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be discovered, and that to none but friends! but <hi>they that are zealous for the Bishop of</hi> Rome, shape their Opinions by their Affections. Some that are zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, <hi>conceit those things to be feigned, because they think it unworthy of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Chair, that so great a Bishop should sacrifice to Idols.</hi> While some of them, that are <hi>zealous too for the Bishop of</hi> Rome, because they remember <hi>how</hi> Peter's <hi>deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al did not hurt him,</hi> and know that the fear of the former might easily be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with pretences enow, think it better to retain this Council. For <hi>there is joy
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:55872:133"/>
among the Angels for a Sinner that repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;</hi> and <hi>Marcellinus'</hi>s Martyrdome is as glorious to the <hi>Chair,</hi> as his Fall was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful. The one are afraid of the Popes Infallibility, and because they think the Fall of <hi>Marcellinus</hi> in that respect too dangerous to be recorded, would suppress the Council: The other are zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the Popes Supremacy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they would exempt him from all Superiours, and make him uncapable of being judged by any, record the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. And which is the Wisest, that is the Question: Not what is true, but what is expedient? While their Judgments are formed not according to <hi>Things,</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies.</p>
                     <p>Another reason why we reject this Council is because it containeth a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which no true Record of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty teacheth: but where with the Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries before laid open do extreamly abound.

                        </gap>. that implies some extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Cause not to be uttered</p>
                     <p>Another reason of our opposing it, is because it so notoriously wresteth the H. Scriptures. That Place which is spoken of the <hi>general</hi> Account, which all men must give at the Day of judgement, being applied in <hi>particular,</hi> to shew that no man may condemn the Pope. <hi>Out of thine own Mouth thou shalt be justified, &amp;c.</hi> Which being the Sole foundation on which they lay any stress, is with somuch ridiculous Babling repeated, that it would turn a mans Stomack, and make him sick to peruse it.</p>
                     <p>But the Impossibility of the Thing is an Argument <hi>ad Hominem,</hi> that may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be more convincing. For as they hold that no man may condemn a Pope, So do they hold that no man, but he, can call a Council. And though for <hi>Form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake</hi> they ascribe the Power of Calling Councils, in the Vacancy of the See, to the Roman Clergy; yet when a Pope is <hi>Alive,</hi> they utterly deny it to them, orany else: Because the Pope is Supreme, and be he Good or Bad, <hi>can be judged by none.</hi> By what Authority then did the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:55872:134"/>
Roman Clergy call this Council, before the Pope was judicially deposed. If the Roman Clergy take upon them to condemn him before he is heard, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is worse than that of other men. If they presume to call a Council before he is condemned, they usurp his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and act independently to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Chair, in such sort as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of; there being no President or Copy but this, of such a Proceeding. Though the Pope were a Criminal, yet every one must not judg him. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they will Confess there have been many wicked Popes, yet while the Pope is a Pope, no man without his Authority may call a Council. The thing is impossible therefore in it self. For he must First be condemned, before a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil could be called to condemn him; and before he could be condemned, the Council must be called. Which would seem among Protestants a Contradiction.</p>
                     <p>The Absurditie of the Plot, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason why we reject it. Three hundred Bishops in a persecution adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their Lives to meet together, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an unwarrantable Call before the Pope was convicted as a Criminal, and without knowing whether he would
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:55872:135"/>
come to Judgment; though certainly knowing that none could compel him, convene him before them. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one Day 14. Witnesses, another Day 44. And care is taken, according to the Decree of the <hi>Epilogus Brevis:</hi> to compleat the number of 72. Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: And when all is done, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse they have no Power to condemn him. The Absurdities are not easily fathomed. How gross was it for the Roman Clergy to call a Council for the Deposing of a Pope, whom they before knew nothing could condemn but his own Sentence? How absurd, for them to judg the Pope, whom they continually teach no man can judg? How much more absurd for the Council to meet to depose him, who if he were pleased to declare their Sentence null, all was in vain? It is just as if a <hi>Rebellions</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should meet on their own Heads, to call their King to account, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his Crimes. If this be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, all must be Disorder and Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>If his Ingenuity had led <hi>him</hi> to depose himself, without giving all these Bishops the trouble, he might have done it at home. That he wanted Ingenuity, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:55872:135"/>
of the Fact (before the Council) te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth. Whereupon I wonder what brought him thither, or what Miracle made him stand before the Bar, at his Tryal? But had he not denied the Fact, the Ceremony had been lost of <hi>producing seventy and two Witnesses.</hi> Which rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the putid Forgery of the <hi>Epilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus Brevis,</hi> as yet unmade, utterly mars the business.</p>
                     <p>The Council it self is the greatest evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence against it self in the World. If you please to give your self the trouble of reading it, either in <hi>Peter Crab,</hi> or <hi>Suri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> or <hi>Nicolinus,</hi> or <hi>Binius,</hi> and compare it with the Letters of Pope <hi>Sylvester</hi> and the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> recorded afterwards, you will find reason to believe the very same <hi>Dunce</hi> made them all. Those three being the absurdest pieces, that ever were seen with learned eyes.</p>
                     <p>For a Taste of this, take but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the two old pretended Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, A. and C. to let go the third, which being made by latter men, is nothing to the purpose.</p>

And we have decreed that this H.

So easie it is to blow mens minds with a Breath, when they are dead and gone. <hi>His Princes also, and the whole people subject to the Empire of the Roman Glory, judged it prositable, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him, and his Nobles,</hi> to do that which they abhorred before, to give to Banished <hi>Sylvester,</hi> and his Heirs, the Glory of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: As it that one Miracle had in a trice for Virtue out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone all our <hi>Saviours.</hi>

                     <p>THose things (<hi>saith</hi> Binius <hi>in his Notes)</hi> which are told concerning the Dominion and Temporal Kingdom, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> are manifestly enough proved to be likely, by what we said in our Notes upon the former Epistle; as well as by the Munificence of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour himself, never enough to be praised.</p>
                     <p>Observe here the modesty of the man! He ought to prove the Instrument itself; but that he throws by, and talks of the <hi>Dominion,</hi> and <hi>Temporal Kingdom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Neither will he undertake to prove it <hi>certain,</hi> but <hi>likely,</hi> that the Dominion and Temporal Kingdom was given to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. He cites his Notes on a counterfeit Epistle, to make it <hi>likely:</hi> For the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle going before was the <hi>Epistle of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiades,</hi> which he confesseth to be a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery.</p>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:55872:149"/>
                     <p n="4">4. The Munificence of the Emperour makes it probable, that he gave away the Empire to the See of <hi>Rome. If you will not believe this, you are an hard-hearted man; for</hi> Binius <hi>says it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Notes upon the <hi>former Epistle,</hi> to which he refers you, are these:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>That the things which are written in this Epistle concerning the Donation of <hi>Constantine</hi> to <hi>Melchiades</hi> and <hi>Sylvester,</hi> are true, is proved not only from hence, but most firmly also by the Authority of <hi>Optatus Milevitanus,</hi> a most approved Writer. For he writeth, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cont. Parm.</hi> that <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Licinius</hi> being the third time Consuls, to wit, in the year of Christ 313. a Council of 19 Bishops was held at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Cause of <hi>Caecilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and the <hi>Donatists,</hi> in the <hi>Lateran,</hi> in the House of <hi>Fausta,</hi> which was the Seat of the Roman Bishop. Truly he doth not expresly write, that the House was given to <hi>Melchiades</hi> by the Emperour: but since no reason doth appear for which it is necessary, that the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 19 Bishops should require larger Rooms out of the House of <hi>Melchia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> that wherein the foresaid Synod was assembled, to wit, the <hi>Lateran,</hi> or House of <hi>Fausta,</hi> can by no prudent
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:55872:150"/>
person any more be doubted, to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Emperour to <hi>Melchiades</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lateran</hi> is not so much as named in the Epistle of <hi>Melchiades;</hi> but that <hi>he left the Imperial Seat, which the Roman Princes had possest, and granted it to the profit of the blessed</hi> Peter, <hi>and his Bishops.</hi> Which considering what follows, is far more fit to be understood of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours <hi>leaving Rome,</hi> and granting it to the Bishop: whence they pretend, he did go on purpose. So that the agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Optatus Milevitanus,</hi> and the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of <hi>Melchiades,</hi> is very small, or none at all.</p>
                     <p>But admit that <hi>Melchiades</hi> and <hi>Optatus Milevitanus</hi> had said, both of them, that the <hi>Lateran</hi> was given to <hi>Melchiades;</hi> what is that to the <hi>Dominion and Temporal Kingdom?</hi> A single House, instead of an Empire! Though, that the House was given, <hi>Optatus Milevitanus</hi> doth not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, even by <hi>Binius</hi> his own confession.</p>
                     <p>How <hi>the things in this Epistle</hi> should be <hi>concerning the Donation of</hi> Constantine <hi>to</hi> Melchiades <hi>and</hi> Sylvester, is difficult to conceive; because <hi>Melchiades</hi> was dead before the Donation was made to <hi>Sylvesier.</hi> It is very unlikely therefore
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:55872:150"/>
that <hi>Melchiades</hi> should make mention of that <hi>Donation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Epistle talking of <hi>Constantine his being President in the H. Synod that was called at</hi> Nice, is a manifest Imposture, <hi>Melchiades</hi> being dead before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council; as is before observed: Yet hence it is proved, that <hi>Constantine <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                        </hi> a <hi>Donation</hi> to <hi>Melchiades</hi> and <hi>Sylvester.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Binius <hi>holdeth fast the</hi> Donation, <hi>though he lets go the</hi> Epistle. <hi>Like a Lo gician, who lets go the premises, but keeps the conclusion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it is most firmly proved by <hi>Optatus Milevitanus.</hi> What is proved by him? <hi>That</hi> Constantine <hi>the Great gave the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran to</hi> Melchiades. How is it proved? Why <hi>he</hi> testifieth, <hi>that a Council of</hi> 19 <hi>Bishops met in</hi> Fausta's <hi>house in the</hi> Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran. <hi>Truly he doth not expresly write, that the house was given to</hi> Melchiades. But it seemeth probable to <hi>Binius</hi> his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: And so it is <hi>most firmly proved by</hi> Optatus Milevitanus, <hi>a most approved Writer.</hi> Thus <hi>those things that are told concerning the Dominion and Temporal Kingdom given to the See of</hi> Rome, <hi>are manifestly enough proved to be likely by what we said in our Notes upon the former Epistle.</hi> But it is better proved, <hi>by the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:55872:151"/>
continual possession of those houses, by the space of thirteen Ages, until now;</hi> as he afterwards observeth. Though the length of an unjust Tenure increaseth the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.</p>
                     <p>Having first proved the <hi>Donation,</hi> he proceedeth thus. <hi>Hoc Edictum à Graecis persidâ Donatione (quâ, juxta illud.</hi> Virg. 2. Aeneid. <hi>Timeo Danaos &amp; Dona feren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes; donare solent acceptum) mutilum esse, ac dolosè depravatum, hae rationes evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denter demonstrant. These following rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons evidently shew this Edict of</hi> Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, <hi>by the persidious Donation of the Greeks, to be maimed, and treacherously depraved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He enters upon the business gently, pretending at first (as if the Donation were true) that it was <hi>depraved</hi> by the Greeks. But afterwards, when he is a little warm in the Argument, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what further off from his Sophistical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, he falls foul upon it as a <hi>Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit,</hi> and rejects it altogether; as in the close will appear to the considerate Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But here let us see what Arguments he produceth, to prove it <hi>maimed, and treacherously depraved.</hi>

                     <p>The new found Hereticks that oppose this Edict of <hi>Constantine,</hi> translated out of <hi>Greek</hi> into <hi>Latine,</hi> with such great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, and impertinent study; let them know, that in this they rather further our Cause, than fight against us: Who do our selves, with <hi>Irenaeus, Cyprian,</hi> and other Holy Fathers, as well <hi>Greek</hi> as <hi>Latine,</hi> profess the Priviledges of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not to be conferred and given of men, but from Christ to <hi>Peter,</hi> and from <hi>Peter</hi> to his Successors.</p>

For suppose
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:55872:152"/>
our Saviour made S. <hi>Peter</hi> the Rock on which he built his Church: How comes the Pope to be that Rock? Since S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> being an Apostle immediately inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and able to pen <hi>Canonical Scripture,</hi> some of his Prerogatives were <hi>Personal,</hi> and died with him?

All he can produce, is S. <hi>Clement'</hi>s counterfeit Letter, and that miscarries.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>in opposing the Edict of</hi> Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, <hi>the Protestants further their Cause, rather than fight against them.</hi> Is not this a bold Aslertion? Their Popes have laid Claim to the whole Empire of the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern World, even by this very <hi>Edict,</hi> or <hi>Donation of Constantine:</hi> And yet the Protestants did nothing, when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it to be a Forgery.

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:55872:153"/>
Certainly they that have Fingers so long as to grasp at an Empire, and Foreheads so hard as to claim it by <hi>Frauds,</hi> will stick at nothing they can conceive for their advantage. Is it impertinent to discover Knavery in the Holy Roman Catholick Church; or Imposture in the Infallible Chair? And together with the Credit of <hi>Rome,</hi> to take away an Empire? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the <hi>Spiritual Right</hi> of being the <hi>Rock,</hi> there are ample <hi>Territories</hi> and <hi>Cities</hi> claimed, with a Temporal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                     <p>Let him therefore pretend what he will, the Authority of such Instruments is very convenient: And because he knows it well enough, he produces the <hi>Diplomata,</hi> or the <hi>Patents of other Kings and Emperours,</hi> to confirm the Churches Secular Right, <hi>extant,</hi> as he saith, <hi>in the Original, with their Imperial Seals; as particularly those of the Most Christian Princes of</hi> France, <hi>restoring those things which the</hi> Longobards <hi>took away.</hi> But he does not tell you, by what Arts they got possession of those Territories at first, nor by what Ancient Evidences, Seals, or Patents, they held them before the <hi>Longobards</hi> touched them.</p>
                     <p>And because a Kingdom is of much

Moment in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther saith, <hi>As for the Dominion of things temporal given to the Church, herself proves them by the Broad Seals of the very Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours giving them, yet extant in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, and she quietly enjoyeth them.</hi> How quiet her injoyment is, you may see by that stir and opposition she meeteth, and by all the clamour throughout the Christian World, that followeth her Usurpations. Which she defendeth here by the Seals <hi>of Emperours</hi> in general Terms, but what Seals they are, she scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth as it were, to mention in particular. Which argueth her cause to be as <hi>Bad,</hi> as her pretence is <hi>Bold.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>He makes a large Confession here; wherein three things are fit to be noted. <hi>The first that ever used this Edict was a Pope:</hi> Pope <hi>Leo</hi> 9. 2. <hi>He used it immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after it came forth:</hi> For <hi>Sylvesters</hi> Acts came forth about the year 1060. <hi>being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards increased with the Addition of this Edict of</hi> Constantine; and some 54 years after, the Pope made use of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in it. Wherein <hi>he is followed by many, very many of the Gravest and most Learned Popish Doctors;</hi> which is the third thing to be noted. This fault of the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:55872:156"/>
Popish Doctors, who did <hi>read and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> this Donation of <hi>Constantine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any suspition of Fraud and Imposture,</hi> being by <hi>Binius</hi> charged upon the Pope. The Shepherd went out of the way, and the Sheep followed him. The Captain, and the Herd, did all stray and miscarry: <hi>Leo 9.</hi> being somewhat like the Dragon in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that threw down the third part of the Stars with his Tail.</p>
                     <p>Binius <hi>his Cure is but the shift of a</hi> Mountebank, <hi>to save his Credit. There are Errours and Heresies in the</hi> Donation of Constantine, <hi>which whosoever recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the</hi> Donation, <hi>he receiveth them in like manner: And to say, that the Head and its Members in the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>were deceived</hi> by the Evil Art and sorry Faith of the Grecians, <hi>while they licked up this Vomit of</hi> Balsamon, <hi>for the Popes advantage; is but a sorry shift, a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosive that eats like a Canker. For it shews how the Holy Catholick Roman Church may be</hi> deceived; <hi>Head and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Pope and Doctors, Priests and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. They were imposed on by an</hi> Evil Art <hi>it seems, and swallowed down</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie <hi>in</hi> Constantine's Donation.</p>
                     <p>But that <hi>Binius</hi> lyes in his prevaricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and that the <hi>Greeks</hi>
                        <pb n="276" facs="tcp:55872:157"/>
were not the Authors of the Donation, and that it did not intend to hurt the Popes Chair, is evident by this. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was made not to overthrow, but confirm the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of the Popes Supremacy, point blank against what <hi>Binius</hi> pretends. He that made it had an eye both to the <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Priviledges of the <hi>Roman</hi> Chair. For the <hi>Donation</hi> applieth those Scriptures, on which the Popes build their Right, to S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Successors, and makes the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percur to note, that the Will of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was the Root of all his Kindness to the Chair: nay it expresly throws all on our Saviours Institution. <hi>For it is just, that the Holy Law should retain the Head</hi>

to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there undertook the Chair, of his Apostleship, <hi>by our Saviours Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</hi> Which if they could make the World believe, their work would be half done. So that it utterly destroys the Interest of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Root and Branch altogether <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> Neither did the <hi>Greeks</hi> ever use it to disgrace the Roman Church, for ought I can find, though the Romans used it, to magnifie their Church above all other Churches.</p>

                     <p>Here we come to know the manner how Decretal Epistles were made: Good passages stoln out of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> are clapt Artificially together, and a Grain or two of <hi>Interest,</hi> thrust neatly in, makes up an <hi>Epistle.</hi> This of <hi>Binius</hi> is plain dealing. <hi>Isidore</hi> is confessed to be a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler,</hi> that is, a Forger, rather than a <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector,</hi> or Recorder of the Councils.</p>
                     <p>* Note this well: because <hi>Isidore</hi> is the Fountain (a muddy dirty one) out of which they drink their waters.</p>
                     <p>This acknowledgment is the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, because <hi>Baronius, Labbè,</hi> and <hi>Cossartius,</hi> and the <hi>Collectio Regia,</hi> herein do keep <hi>Binius</hi> Company.</p>

                     <p>The Invocation of Angels, though they were known to be Angels, is by the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi> called <hi>Idolatry:</hi> Which vindicates Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> in his acceptation of the word <hi>Idolatry,</hi> from the cavils of his Adversary.

                     <p>After this, in another place, (by it self) under the name of <hi>Alphonsus Pisanus,</hi> with the Patronage of <hi>Francis Turrian,</hi> he bringeth in a whole Legend of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, to the number of fourscore, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered all upon the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Code</hi> it self there are the Epistles of <hi>Alexander Alexandrinus, Constantine the Emperour,</hi> and the whole <hi>Synod,</hi> the <hi>Emperours Oration,</hi> the <hi>Recantation of</hi> Theognis <hi>and</hi> Eusebius <hi>Bishop of</hi> Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>media, the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> and the 20 <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons

Then there is an humble Letter, whereby the Council sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth it self to the Popes Censure; but in the Column on the other side (for there are 2 Columns in the Leaf) it is defaced with an empty Blank, for want of a Greek Copy.</p>
                     <p>For fear this Letter should not be seen often enough, he hath it again, with the Answer of Pope <hi>Sylvester</hi> thereunto; both recorded in another place, near to the <hi>Arabick</hi> Canons; detected by these marks: They are without any Greek Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, are not among the Acts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, are full of mistakes and Barbarismes, and clearly refelled by the Genuine Acts of the Council it self.</p>
                     <p>The Epistles are these.

                     <p>Though the Nonsense be the most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible that ever was seen, the exactness is great: For in token of the Spirit of Prophecy, the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> telleth them at <hi>Nice,</hi> that they were <hi>three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eighteen,</hi> and dateth the day on which his Letter was received: which I think was extraordinary.</p>
                     <p>But there is a contradiction in these Dull Letters, that mars all. They at <hi>Nice</hi> inform the Pope, that <hi>all the Bishops of the Apostolical City were assembled in one, and held his Council</hi> for him there: The Pope on the other side tells them of a
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:55872:163"/>
Council at <hi>Rome</hi> of the Bishops <hi>of all the City of</hi> Italy <hi>(assembled) whence</hi> he sent <hi>the Truth examined by his Disciples there</hi> (as he calls them) for them at <hi>Nice,</hi> to receive: which he prayes them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, &amp;c. I confess the nonsence so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, that it is difficult to construe it to any sense at all: but divers circumstances interpret the words so, that <hi>Praecepta</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>Canons,</hi> and <hi>Episcopi totius urbis</hi> Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liae, the Roman Synod under <hi>Sylvester:</hi> As those other words, <hi>Meum Chirogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phum &amp; Discipulorum meorum offero;</hi> his own Subscription, and the Subscription of the Bishops under him, whereby he confirmed the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council.</p>
                     <p>For the Legend goes, that while the Council was sitting at <hi>Nice</hi> of 318 Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, <hi>Sylvester</hi> called a Council at <hi>Rome</hi> of 267 Bishops; where they made Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons as they did at <hi>Nice,</hi> and as good luck was, confirmed the Council there: Else all at <hi>Nice</hi> had not been worth a Rush. And to this <hi>Roman</hi> Council <hi>Sylvester</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth, when he saith, <hi>I send you mine, and my Disciples hands to give our joynt consent to all. that you have ordained.</hi> This is that Council which made the <hi>Epilogus Brevis,</hi> the commending of which to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, (were there nothing in
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:55872:164"/>
the Letter beside) would disgrace it for Cosin-German to that putid Forgery, so often touched in the <hi>Epilogus Brevis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Council is set by <hi>Binius</hi> (I know not why) before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council; though it professeth it self to be held <hi>at the same time.</hi> Perhaps the reason is, that they could not be set down both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and Priority was to be given to the Synod at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Title of this Council is,</p>
                     <q>

                     <p>It immediately follows <hi>Constantines Donation,</hi> and dependeth on the truth of the same.</p>
                     <p>The Popes <hi>See</hi> is magnified therein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Skies; and for that reason it shineth among the Councils, as a Direful Comet among the Stars of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>The Proem set before it bears the name of the <hi>Epilogue,</hi> Epilogus brevis, &amp;c. <hi>A short Epilogue of the following Roman Council.</hi> A Trip in the Threshold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiaying the Author.

                     <p>But this First is a small Indecency, we proceed to the matter.

                     <p>Therein it is recorded, that <hi>in the time
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:55872:165"/>
of</hi> Sylvester <hi>and</hi> Constantine <hi>the most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Emperour, while</hi> 318 <hi>Bishops sat in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at</hi> Nice, <hi>by the Command of</hi> Sylvester; <hi>on the thirteenth of the Kalends of</hi> July, <hi>there was a Council of</hi> 267 <hi>Bishops conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at</hi> Rome, <hi>by the Canonical Call of the Pope: That again condemned</hi> Callistus, Arrius, Photius, <hi>and</hi> Sabellius, <hi>before condemned in the</hi> Nicene <hi>Council, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that no</hi> Arrian <hi>Bishop returning, should be received by any but the Bishop of the place. In which also, by the consent and Subscription of all, it was ordained, That no Lay-man should accuse a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and that no Priest should accuse a Bishop, no Deacon a Priest, no Sub-Deacon a Deacon, no Acolythite a Sub-Deacon, no Exorcist an Acolythite, no Reader an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcist, no Door-keeper a Reader. It was further ordained, that no Bishop should be condemned but by the Testimony of at least threescore and twelve Witnesses, nor shall the Highest Priest be judged by any,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This Decree is put among the Popes Laws by <hi>Ivo Cartonensis,</hi> &amp;c. Doubtless to the very great ease and satisfaction of the <hi>Roman Clergy:</hi> For it reaches down, you know, to the lowest Orders of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>Door keepers.</hi> So that they may write as many Forgeries as they will: If
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:55872:165"/>
it be a Pope, no man can condemn him: If it be a Bishop, no less than threescore and twelve Bishops, must on their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Oath prove the Fact against him: forty four <hi>Equals,</hi> against a Cardinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Priest, twenty six must depose against a Cardinal-Deacon of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and seven against a Door keeper; all which must be at least his Equals. A Marvellous Priviledge for <hi>the City of Rome!</hi> Which word <hi>Rome,</hi> though annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to <hi>Cardinal-Deacons,</hi> yet, for ought I know, the Judge will interpret its Extent, to all the other Orders; or use it <hi>Equivocally,</hi> as himself listeth, or as his Superiour pleaseth. So that in Causes pertaining to the Interest of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> other Priests perhaps, beside them in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> shall enjoy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this Law; but in Causes displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Pope, and his Accomplices, none shall enjoy it, but the Priests of <hi>Rome.</hi> Many such <hi>Trap-doors</hi> are prepared in Laws, where Rulers are perverse and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical; and whether this be not one of those, I leave to the Readers further Examination.</p>

                        <hi>Mark</hi> succeeded <hi>Sylvester</hi> in the See of <hi>Rome:</hi> Between whom, and <hi>Athanasius,</hi> there were certain Letters framed, that

stand upon Record to this day, to prove the Canons of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council to be <hi>Threescore and ten.</hi> Heretofore they were good old Records magnificently cited: but now they are worn out: for <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> have lately rejected them; who are followed by <hi>Binius,</hi> as he is by <hi>Labbe</hi> and <hi>Cossartius</hi> and the <hi>Collectio Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> all concluding the Letters to be For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.

                     <p>The matter in these Epistles is <hi>the Popes Supremacy; the unlamfulness of calling Councils, but by his Authority; his Right of receiving Appeals;</hi> with other Themes, which Ambition and self Interest suggest, and of which genuine Antiquity is totally silent.</p>

                     <p>Having so fortunately glanced upon that Sixth Council, I shall not trouble the Reader with any more: but bewailing what I observe, beseech him earnestly to weigh this <hi>Business walking in the Dark,</hi> and take heed of a <hi>Pope</hi> and a <hi>Church,</hi> that hath exceeded all the World in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie. For let the Earth be searched from East to West, from Pole to Pole, Jews, Turks, Barbarians, Hereticks, none of them have soared so high, or so often made the Father of Lies their Patron, in things of so great Nature and Importance.

                  <p>About 100 years after, <hi>Eulabius</hi> sate in the Chair at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> (some call him <hi>Eulalius:</hi>) Between him and <hi>Boniface</hi> 2. there are two Epistles extant, out of which it is gathered, that after the sixth Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> the African Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were Excommunicated by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for 100 years, and reconciled at last upon the Submission of <hi>Eulalius,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> accursing S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and his own Predecessors.</p>

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:55872:169"/>
concerning the Union of S. <hi>Augustine, Eugenius, Fulgentius,</hi> and other Africans with the Roman Church: And again, either there was no <hi>Eulabius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to whom <hi>Boniface</hi> seemeth to write; or at least there was none at that time: as is evident out of the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology of <hi>Nicephorus</hi> of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Besides, <hi>Boniface</hi> intimates in his Epistle, that he wrote at the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Justinus</hi> the Emperour. But <hi>Justinus</hi> was dead before <hi>Boniface</hi> began to sit; as is manifest out of all Histories.

                  <p>Notwithstanding all these reasons, <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> is afraid to <hi>damn</hi> the Epistles: but Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> is a little more bold.

                  <p>And speaking concerning the Schism, Excommunication, and Re-union of the <hi>African</hi> Churches, he saith, <hi>Sihaec vera sunt, &amp;c. If these things are true, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then all the Martyrs and Confessors,

which were at that very time crowned with Martyrdom in the</hi> African <hi>Church, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise waxed famous by the Merits of their Eminent Sanctity, must be blotted out of the List of Saints, which</hi> THE HOYL RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAN CHURCH <hi>it self hath, in its Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrology, numbred among the Martyrs, or reckoned among the Confessors.

                  <p>If Lyes were always consistent, <hi>Truth</hi> would be amazed. God doth infatuate the Counsels of his Enemies, and turn their Wisdom into Foolishness.
