         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>After this, I had inteligence of a Pamphelet that was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly ſpread, wherein was deſcribed the maner of her Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, penned by ſome Archpapiſt that was aſhamed to put to his owne name, and yet of ſuche accoumpt amongſt our Catholikes in thoſe quarters, that it carieth better credite then either the Epiſtles of Sainct Paule, or the Goſpelles of the fower Euangeliſtes: and by the reportes of ſundrie credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſonages, diuers Copies of it are ſent ouer the Sea as a precious preſent, ſome to <hi>Fraunce,</hi> ſome to <hi>Rome,</hi> but very many into <hi>Irelande.</hi>

holie Fathers doctrine, conſiſteth in Dreames, olde Wiues tales, Vnknowwen ſcriptures, Traditions of menne, ſtraunge Miracles, Fables, and Follies.</p>
            <p>Truely our countrey is to be lamented, in whiche the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell hauyng raigned long, and Religion floriſhed ſo many yeres, yet Superſtition preuaileth ſo muche, that thei be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to bee leade awaie with ſuche euident ſhewes of follie, that vnleſſe their eyes were bleared with too muche impudencie, it were not poſſible thei ſhould bee ſo deceiued. But what Aſſe but would haue been aſhamed to haue penned doune ſo ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a matter, vnder ſuche a ſhewe of veritie, but that he knew emongeſt whom to ſende it: For truely the fooliſhe credulitie of the ſimpleſt ſorte of our ignorant Papiſtes is ſuche, that tell them a tale of a Maſſe, Purgatorie, of holie Water, of the ſigne of the Croſſe, or of any other ſuche like vanitie: and thei are ſtreght leade in beleef of ſuche thynges, to bee more then deuine, that (in deede) doe moſte deſerue to bee laught at. You maie ſee thei are driuen to a bare ſhifte, that (for want of better matter) would foiſte in a Religion with ſuche traſhe as this, but vnhappie thei that are ſo blinded in errour, that thei ſhould not bee able to deſcerne vanitie from veritie: And this is the cauſe why thei reſtraine the Laietie, from the readyng of the Scripture, for otherwiſe it were not poſſible, that ſuche Fables could bee ſo preciouſly accoumpted of: And this is the cauſe that I haue laied open theſe Viſions, to the vewe of the worlde, that thoſe that bee wiſe might laugh, at the doltiſhe deuiſes of our ſeducyng Papiſtes, who vnder a ſhewe of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, deceiues the ſimple ſore with ſuche manifeſt vntruthes. But yet to lament the weakeneſſe of thoſe that be ignoraunt, who bee ſtill readie to entertaine ſuche trifles, as deuine and heauenly miſteries, to feede them in their farther follies.</p>
            <p>But I muſt needes blame our aucthour, what ſo euer he was, who (as it ſeemeth) hauyng been long tyme ſchooled in the liyng Legend of <hi>Antechriſt,</hi> hath yet forgotten the cheefeſt axioma that longes to his profeſſion, whiche is, <hi>oportet men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datem eſſe memorem,</hi> who lies muſt bee carefull to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb facs="tcp:5425:18"/>
for in knittyng vp his Viſions, where he would haue made greateſt ſhewe of veritie, euen there he laies in ſight moſte manifeſt vntruthes: whiche I will not toucht in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities, for that thei bee freuilous, yet will I note them in generall, for that thei bee odious, and deſerues no better aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, then a ſcoffe or a mocke.</p>
            <p>His exordium taken from the ſanctified Archaungell <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaell</hi> might well haue ſtande, if his cauſe had been iuſte, but now it is confeſſed, that all theſe Miracles were but fantaſies, and the Propheteſſe in her Patheticall extaſies, but a ſillie Maiden, ſeduced by a runnegate Papiſt, as now it is proued: And the matter it ſelf if it bee wiſely marked, is enterlarded with contrarietie of vntruthes: in one place ſhe could diſcribe the roabes whiche Chriſte ſhould weare, to bee of Purple co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and preſently ſhe feineth them to bee more brighter then the beames of the Sunne: and although ſhe knewe Chriſte, with his mother the Virgine Marie, his Graunde mother Sainct Anne, with Marie Magdalene, and Sainct Ihon the Baptiſt, euen at the firſt ſight, bothe of her firſt and laſte Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, yet when Saincte Ihon ſhould come to ſaie his Maſſe, ſhe was afraied of them, and tooke them to bee Goblins, till Chriſt had giuen her his hande to bee felt.</p>
            <p>The aſſiſtauntes ſo many tymes ſpoken of, our aucthour would perſwade thei were Proteſtauntes, and therefore wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with her exclamations againſt Religion now vſed, yet who would beleeue any woorde to bee true, when one of them had a Crucifixe ſo readie to preſent, and the reſte was ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe to ſuffer her to take it. The Apoſtles when ſhe coumpted them, ſhe ſaieth were iuſte eleuen, I wonder where the twelfe was, or who it was that was miſſyng, but it might bee that this Viſion was reuealed before Mathias was choſen in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das roome, or els it was Sainct Peter that was miſſyng, for he is Porter in heauen, and therefore could not bee ſpared out of his office, and I thinke if he had been there, he had been a fitter man to haue ſaied Maſſe, then Saincte Ihon, for that he hymſelf was oure Pope, and therefore ſhould haue ſo muche
<pb facs="tcp:5425:18"/>
the better experience.</p>
            <p>Thus thou maieſt ſee (gentle reader) that varietie, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilitie are the twoo beſt ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ynges that our aucthour hath to his bowe, who findyng no other meanes to maintaine his vncertainties, thinketh vnder diſſeblyng vntruthes, to drawe the ſimplicitie of the common ſorte, from the truthe and right Religion.</p>
            <p>But admitte that theſe feigned Viſions had been ſenciblie ſeen, and that ſome apparaunce had been made of theſe ſurmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Reuelations, ſhould wee therevppon ſtraight waies eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhe a Religion, without any further examination, how thei might ſtande with the will of God. Our learned Fathers lead by the ſpirite of Wiſedome, when thei heard of ſuche Viſions or Reuelations, thei brought them ſtraight to the toucheſtone comparyng them to the holie Scriptures, if thei founde them ſuche as tended to the glorie of God, thei admitted them for good, if otherwiſe miſleadyng to ignoraunce and errour, thei condemned them as illuſions ſent by the Deuill. But is there any thyng more repugnaunte to Chriſtian beleef, then that God is not ſufficient to forgiue vs our ſinnes, but wee muſte haue a quittaunce ſealed from our Ladie, and ſhe that was wont to bee called our Ladie of Pitie, is now become a gentil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman of too muche crueltie. But our aucthour verie wiſely excuſyng the matter, thinkes there was ſome ſinne, that was committed againſt her ſelf, and though that bothe her ſoonne Chriſt and ſhe had forgiuen all the reſte, yet ſhe might not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue that. And beleeue me this maie well bee true, for the Pope hymſelf is of the ſame condition, for he hath Pardons for hym that will kill his father, for hym that ſhould commit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtious fornication with his mother, for hym that ſhould bee a rebell to his Prince, a traitour to his Countrey, to be ſhort, Treaſon, Murther, Robberie, Adultrie, Bauderie, Bugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: and what not but our holie Father will forgiue you, ſo you doe not touche hymſelf, nor none of his broode: but the leaſte offence that maie bee committed againſt any of theſe, though God and our Ladie bothe would forgiue ye, yet I can tell you
<pb facs="tcp:5425:19"/>
the Pope will neuer doe it. But what a pretie wipe hath our aucthour giuen here to our holie fathers Bulles, who y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Deuill will make any accoumpte of them now hereafter this, for the Pope though he bee Chriſtes Vicar, yet he is none of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and though he maie diſpence with matters in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie betweene vs and God, yet he hath nothyng adoe betweene vs and our Ladie, vnleſſe it bee by the waie of intreatie, and our Ladie I perceiue when ſhe is angred, hath a womans ſtomacke, ſhe will not eaſily bee pacified, and then there is no ſhift but you muſt to Purgatorie, for Chriſtes forgiueſſe will doe you no good, and the Pope can pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no more, then Chriſt is able to forgiue: And therefore I perceiue the Prouerbe to bee true, the houſe is too vnquiet where the good wife weares the breeches, and yet you ſee it is ſo in heauen.</p>
            <p>When Marie Magdalen went to the Sepulchre with tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res to ſeeke Chriſte, to whom although he firſte ſhewed hym ſelf, yet ſhe might not ſo muche as once to touche hym, yet our yonge Propheteſſe, who as our aucthour affirmeth was ignoraunt, an heretique, one that was ſeuered from the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes Churche, and therefore by their owne Canons and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Counſailes condemned, not worthie to touche any of their holie reliques, and yet ſhe might bee ſuffered to imbrace Chriſte in her armes.</p>
            <p>The matter that our Author by theſe Viſions would fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt induce you vnto, conſiſteth eſpecially in theſe three poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. Firſt he would bryng you in good likyng of their bleſſed Maſſe. Seconde, he would make you afearde of their dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Purgatorie: And laſtly, it greeues hym to the harte that any bodie ſhould goe to Churche to heare the worde of God: for if thei could once barre vs from readyng the Scriptures, all the paine were paſt, all the reſt would be eaſily brought to a good paſſe.</p>
            <p>Now, firſt for the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, who doubteth (vnleſſe directly blinded) but thei muſt reſolutely conclude, that our forefathers, <hi>Adam, Lot, Noe, Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob,</hi> with the reſt are ſtopped from the fruition of Heauen, in that
<pb facs="tcp:5425:19"/>
thei could not be partakers of the Reall reception of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, vnleſſe it were through faith in beleuyng and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall feedyng, by the whiche we are likewiſe made partakers all of one bodie, and all through one faith.</p>
            <p>For Purgatorie, if it growe by the multiplication of our ſinnes, either in exceſſe or defecte, what ſhall wee imagine of the Theefe on the Croſſe, who by Chriſtes owne wordes was aſſured this: <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradice:</hi> He neuer ſpoke word of Purgatorie. Or what of <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene,</hi> whoſe ſynnes were freely forgiuen her by Chriſte, without goyng to Purgatorie. And what of the poore Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane, that acknowledged hym ſelf a miſerable ſinner, and yet was iuſtified by Chriſte. Or who now hence forwarde will giue any credite to Sainct Paule, who writyng to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes <hi>9.</hi> ſaieth: <hi>There is no remiſſion of ſynnes without bloud.</hi> When our Catholikes makyng hym a manifeſt lyer, hath founde a waie to ſalue all ſores through the fire of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie.</p>
            <p>But be that would bee better confirmed in this poinct, let hym reade <hi>Ihon Frith</hi> againſt the Biſhoppe of <hi>Rocheſter:</hi> ſir <hi>Thomas Moore,</hi> and <hi>Ihon Raſtell,</hi> where thei ſhall finde this phantaſticall Purgatorie ſo vndermined, that no Papiſt but might be aſhamed once to make mention of it.</p>
            <p>Now laſtly as before I haue ſaied: the Pope is very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willyng that the Scripture ſhould bee in a knowne language amongſt vs: but in the ſteede of them, he hath bequeathed vs <hi>Legenda Aurea,</hi> the life of Chriſt, written by a fift Euaunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, named <hi>Bonauentura</hi>: We haue likewiſe their Feſtiuall, with ſuche other ſtuffe. Theſe we maie reade in Engliſh, you maie eaſily geſſe why, but the Scriptures we muſt not heare but in Latin, becauſe thei ſaie it is daungerous that we ſhould reade the Scripture in a knowne language: ſo that the right conſtruction of this ſentence, <hi>Beati qui audiunt verbum dei &amp; coſtodiunt ipſam,</hi> after the interpretation of our holie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, maie thus be vnderſtoode: <hi>Bleſſed are thei whiche heare the worde of God and knowes not what it meaneth.</hi> Theſe
<pb facs="tcp:5425:20"/>
matters haue been by many men ſo Clarckly diſcourſed, and of ſo long a tyme ſo learnedly confuted, and therefore by me lightly ouerpaſſed: I dooe but onely ayme at the intent and wiſhe the wiſeſt to laugh at the errour.</p>
            <p>Thus (gentle Readers) you ſee the courſe of theſe vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall <hi>Antichriſtians,</hi> who when thei finde no one waie, to maintaine their vngodly opinions, ſeeke by ſequeſter dealin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to oppreſſe the truthe. But diſſimulation is eſpied by his contrary, and truthe ſpeaketh in no corners: Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is in it ſelf perfect, requireth no fabulous miracles to confirme it: but where vanitie is workemiſtris, then all thynges are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with ſhadowes.</p>
            <p>Truely it ſeemeth ſtraunge vnto me, that either blinded errour ſhould ſeduce vs ſo ſarre, or ſuppoſitions of good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning blind vs ſo greatly, where the good work is ſo freuilous.</p>
            <p>Let not the God of this world ſo muche bleare your eyes, be not led awaie with euery blaſt of reporte: <hi>Symon Magus,</hi> though he be his craftes maiſter, he is yet found out by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Apoſtle: and the vngracious practiſes, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious intentes, of our fooliſhe Maſmongers are proued friue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, beyng looked into by the true Religion. O call your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues home, and remember from whence you are fallen, be not ſeduced by falſe Gods, to forſake the true Lambe, that ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for you.</p>
            <p>God is truthe, and he that worſhippeth hym muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe hym in ſpirite and truthe. Let not phantaſies miſgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne you, let not your hartes be hardned againſt holſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions.</p>
            <p>Arme your ſelues with the readyng of the worde of God, ſo then charme the Charmer neuer ſo wiſely, he ſhall not yet be able is compaſſe you.</p>
            <p>Peruſe the olde Fathers, examine the holie Scriptures, conferre indifferently bothe literall and ſubſtanciall interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and you ſhall finde that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> the Pope, doth but diſſemble with you, and that all his allegations, are but falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. The poore Publicant ſhall be iuſtified, and the proud
<pb facs="tcp:5425:20"/>
Phariſie ſhall be condemned: Not he that crieth Lorde Lord, but he that doeth the will of the Father. Muche babblyng ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes not Religion, nor burning Tapers zelous Oriſons: But that Lorde that knoweth the harte and raines, reueileth his wiſedome to Infantes, and confoundeth the wiſeſt in their owne ouerwenynges.</p>
            <p>The practiſes that of late daies haue beene brought into this Realme, might confirme our Papiſtes neither to bee ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous nor honeſt. Did not <hi>Campion</hi> ſell Pardons to imploye his money againſt her Maieſtie? did not thei of that confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie, ſell the death of her highneſſe with the cheefeſt Pillers of the ſtate. But the Lorde preſerued <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte of all true Engliſhe myndes, and iniquitie is falne into the pitfall, that he hath prepared for other.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt ſomethyng expoſtulate with ſome our hollowe harted ſubiectes, how thei can without bluſhyng, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that thei loue her Maieſtie, when thei daiely enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thoſe <hi>Ieſuites</hi> whiche ſeeke her deſtruction.</p>
            <p>How maie wee accoumpt them ſubiectes, when thei re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte lawes: or men of religious conſcience, when in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours thei are ſo traiterous.</p>
            <p>My freendes, turne awaie your face from leaſinges, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Lorde to deliuer you from liyng lippes and a deceipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tongue, and he will make you ſpectacles of his mercie.</p>
            <p>Let not forlorne hope miſleade you, or fained miracles withdraw you, nor olde wiues propheſies ſo miſgouerne you, but with all ſubmiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> acknowledge gracious <hi>Elizabeth</hi> your ſoueraigne Queene, who as you are malefactors can and wil puniſhe you, ſo in your humble and hartie ſubmiſſion, no doubt ſhe will receiue you to mercie. The Lorde increaſe her Maieſties raigne, preſerue her Counſaile, continue Religion in the zelous ſubiectes, and graunt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendement to the abſtinat Papiſtes. Amen.</p>
