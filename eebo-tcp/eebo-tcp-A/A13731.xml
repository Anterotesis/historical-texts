            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>ONSIDERYNG</hi> how we are created of two partes, that is to wete, of soule and of bodie, the one wherof is most noble, and the other most vile: thone celestiall, and thother terrestriall: the one eternall, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mortall. Ought it not to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an expresse Folie, that we vniuersal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly geuyng our selfes to the satisfaction and pleasure of this vile earthly &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall part, doe no more regarde that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is noble, celestiall and immortall, than as if we had nothyng to doe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all? Truely, lyke as he deserueth not to be reputed wise, that appliyng all his studie to the trimmyng of his garmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, suffreth his body to perishe for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and disease: Euin so nother ought he to be allowed, that folowyng the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitees of the bodie, habandoneth his soule: the bodie beyng none other but
<pb facs="tcp:20429:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the apparaile to the soule, as the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes to the bodie. And well doe we deserue to be reputed vnwyse, whan (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng on the one parte conformable vnto brute beastes, and of the other syde par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of diuinitee) attendyng onely to the ornament of the earthly part, we do as muche as lieth in vs to transforme that diuinitee that we haue, into earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse. Wherfore the prophete iustly saieth,
<q>
                  <l>The man in honour comparyng his degree,</l>
                  <l>Seeth not how like vnto a brute beast is he.</l>
               </q>
For though we see this Folie to be eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, yet the more part of vs continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrappe our selfes in it: because (of worldly wisedome) thei ar reputed most prudent, that most can fasten theim sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes therin. Of whiche our folie there is not one kinde alone, but many and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, some moued through one opinion, and some through an other: some draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by one affection, &amp; some by an other: alwaies bestowyng their study how best they maie please the bodie. For some apply theyr whole hert and minde to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the pleasures of theyr earthly sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Some other thynke the beautie or valiauntnesse of the body woorthy to be
<pb facs="tcp:20429:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
preferred before all other thinges: some attend onely to the getting and heaping vp of richesse. Some other esteeme no felicitee to be compared vnto the attei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnyng of dignitees and honors: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinke lordshippe and dominion to be that onely felicitee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that none maie be greater or equal: and finally there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not also of theym, that settle all their desires to the gettyng of glory and fame. Unto the studie of whiche thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (if I be not deceiued) the most part of al liuing men haue bent their though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and trauailes. Wherfore examy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng theim by one and one, I determine nowe to see whether there be any thyng in any of theim, that shoulde cause vs thervpon so muche to fixe our desyres.</p>

               <p>AS for the pleasure that trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth our senses, is none other but a craftie flatterer, that with his faulse swetenesse, and with his feigned pleasauntnesse geueth to vnderstand the ill to be good, and the noysome to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. For that soule, whiche suffreth
<pb facs="tcp:20429:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hir selfe to be tangled with the alluryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of pleasure, muste needes at length fynde hir selfe captiue and thrall vnto the bodie: as the diuine Plato well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herseth, saieyng, <hi>Pleasure lyke a driuen nayle fasteneth the soule to the bodie, and ioygneth it so harde together, that it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it become corporall.</hi> Wherof it fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that she (the soule I saie) este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth those thynges to be true, that the bodie presenteth vnto hir: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently delityng in that that the bodie deliteth, must nedes departe farre from euery high and honourable consideraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as it semeth the good Romaine well vnderstode, who hauyng heard a philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher of Athenes saie, that euery thing ought to be doen to thentent to atteigne pleasure, praied god to geue that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto Pyrrhus and to the Samnites (than enemies to the Romaine people) thynkyng by that meane, the Romains shoulde easily atteigne victorie against theim, as by the exaumple of Anniball it did well appeare,
<q>
                     <l>To whom the pleasures of Capua were more noysome,</l>
                     <l>Than were the battailes of Trasimene and Cannas to Rome.</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:20429:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Wherfore not without cause did the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Sparta longe tyme withhold the eies of hir citisins farre from the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Asia: and Scipio Emilius (sent into Spaine) incontinently as he arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at the armie, commaunded that all those thynges, whiche serued the army for pleasure, shoulde immediately be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken awaie. For the whiche bothe the Lacedemoniens and Scipio deserued no lesse commendacion, than Xerxes mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited blame in rewardyng theym that were new inuentours of deliciouse thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and so did Tyberius themperour in erectyng a new office ouer the pleasures in Rome. But what woordes maie be sufficient woorthily to derect the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Aristippus? Who beyng nouris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with moste holie erudicion in the schole of Socrates, (onely to atteigne pleasure) disposed hym selfe to liue in the court of Denys the tyranne, suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng to be spitted on, and a thousande other villainies, whiche he regarded not as longe as he myght with pleasure fill his bealy. And therfore did Diogenes woorthily call hym the kynges dogge: For though he had called hym the kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges swyne, me seemeth he shoulbe haue dooen him no great wronge. And lyke
<pb facs="tcp:20429:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as this mans life (of all men of good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) deserueth reproche, euin so the sentence of Epicure (who otherwise had ben a verie commendable man) maie ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a great deale be folowed than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended: in that he saied, he knewe not how to finde any pleasant thyng, if the taste of meates and the vse of venereall thynges were taken awaie.</p>

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse, offices maie be wel and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily sued for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as often as the sutour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyreth that office for the benefite of a commen wealth, and not of hym selfe. The example wherof hath ben well seen in the olde Cato, who (coueryng to be Censor, and hauyng many concorrentes that desyred the same) in steede of the flatery and praiers that the others vsed, saied to the people: <hi>This people hath nede of a seuere phisicion to geue theim a stronge purgacion: and because I am such a one, as can minister it accordyngly, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore geue it me</hi>: and so with seueritee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined that, whiche other men by flate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb facs="tcp:20429:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and friendship trauailed for. This kynde of requiring and receiuyng of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and dignitees, are commendable and woorthy, wheras the more part of vs prouoked of our owne peruerse opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, entreate, praie, and almoste begge for it: one while of the prince, and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the people. And many tymes the princes either for bribes, or through affection, geue those offices and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, not to theim that deserue and are woorthy of theim, but to suche as are most agreable vnto theyr appetites: like as the people (who Plato compareth to a great beast) furiously without discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion grant their fauours here and there, wherof it foloweth, that oftentymes, whan we thinke to be honoured and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, with shame and reproche we finde our selfes ouerthrowen. Yea and how many times haue the people dooen their best to put theim vnto rebuke, that haue been woorthy men? The histories de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare euidently the repulses geuen by the people of Rome vnto the Tubero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to the Metelli, the Emilii, the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, the Marii, and the Catones, and not yet contented with those repulses, howe manie of the moste noble citisins
<pb facs="tcp:20429:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
haue the wicked people ben accustomed to hate and persecute? Did not the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines banisshe the great Camillus? Didde they not expell Cicero, father of theyr countrey and of eloquence? Did not bothe the famous and worthy Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions Nasica and Africanus, die bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in exile? And the Atheniens also were no lesse vncurteise towardes the rareste of theyr commen wealthe, for they made the worthy Miltiades to die in prison, and banisshed the wyse The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistocles, the liberall Cimon, and the iust Aristides out of theyr citee. The like wherof hath happened in all other commen wealthes, as well auncient as present. And why shoulde they not? hauing the examples of the grauest Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines and of the best learned Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens before theim? As for princes, that exalte the vnwoorthy and suppresse the vertuouse, because there are so many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples seen of it daily, I shall not nede to reherse the auctoritee of the histories therunto, but this woulle I saie, that neither the princes, nor yet the commen wealthes, can dishonour the vertuouse by not exaltyng theim vnto the degrees of honour, rather in not callyng theim,
<pb facs="tcp:20429:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thei dishonour theim selfes and the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces also, in whiche they create the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woorthy men. For (as Plato saieth) he that is woorthie of an office or digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, is officer and of dignitee in dede, and not he whom fauour or fortune graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it vnto. And therfore I saie, vaine is their enterprise, that in sekyng of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitees and offices consume theyr lifes. For if thei would consider what I haue saied, and what the places of honour be, and that the honour and reuerence, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is vsed, is dooen more to the place than to the person, sittyng there in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the countrefaict dooeth in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlude, perchaunce many there be, that woulde eschewe the vanitee therof, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che now pursue it withall theyr power.

of the wicked</hi>: by reason wherof he ought not to haue regard vnto his owne interest, but to the wealth and benefite of them that are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to his charge. His office is to prouide, that they maie well and honestly lyue: He muste kepe them from the assault and violence of straungers: It apperteigneth vnto him, to kepe them in peace and concorde: he ought to determine their causes with iustice, seyng that eche man maie haue his owne, with chastisyng the ill, and rewardyng and honoryng the good: he muste ordeine iudges and magistrates, not for money, for ambicion, or for affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but accordyng to theyr woorthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and merites, and ought to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitte that charge vnto euerie man, that the appoincted man is moste apte to entre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise.

               <p>ANd as for glorie and fame, it is true that it semeth euery man, as he is more excellent of spyrite, the more doeth he desyre it: whiche is clere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seen in euery studie and in euery arte, as well in armes as in learning, as well in peincture as in grauyng, bothe in the handicraftes, and also in housbandrie, in all trauailes, in all peines, and in all perilles, it seemeth none other sauour to be so sweete, as the hope to atteigne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie therof. Yea and further, this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre is so farre entred into our myndes, that they whiche write bookes in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise of glorie, purtyng to theyr names, seeke that whiche they persuade other men to auoyde. And this was it that moued Alexander before the tombe of Achilles to sighe and saie,
<q>
                     <l>Happie wast thou Achilles suche grace to fynde,</l>
                     <l>As the verse of Homer to kepe thyne actes in mynde.</l>
                  </q>
And the same was it that moued Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Caesar at the sight of the image of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander
<pb facs="tcp:20429:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to sighe, because at that age that Alexander had doen so many thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, he yet had dooen nothyng woorthy of memorie. The lyke of whiche thyng that hapned vnto Caesar of Alexander, happened also to Themistocles of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiades, whose tropheys (notable mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of passed victories) woulde not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer hym to slepe. And lyke as Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the desyre of glorie was liberall vnto writers, euin so was Caesar dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in writyng his owne commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to helpe theim that woulde write of hym. And Themistocles saied, that he coulde heare no sweeter voice than of theim that shoulde syng his owne prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Some moued through this desyre haue builded citees, and called them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theyr owne names: some haue made theim goodly houses, with puttyng vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theim lykewise the titles of theyr na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: some haue sette vp goodly sepultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and some goodly images, thynkyng to make theim selfes therwith perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. But what is all this, in respect of the life it selfe, whiche many men haue spente onely for loue of this glorie and fame. For examples wherof I coulde reken vp noumbres of men, that who by

But what folowed therof? In stede of the godhead that he presupposed should haue folowed, he hath left behynde hym a notable memorie of his folie. And yet not contented with this, there haue been some, that with their naughty and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked dooynges haue sought to purchace immortalitee vnto their names: as Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula, seeyng nothyng woorthie wherof there shoulde remayne any memorie of hym, wisshed, that in his tyme there myghte some notable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And the emperour Adrian caused those to be slayne, that he myght here shoulde excell him in any thyng, to the entent he myght remayne as most excellent of his tyme. Besides this, there haue been temples burned, and other fouler thynges dooen onely for the desire of fame, whiche to recyte here shoulde be bothe to longe and also to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouse.

thynges it maketh men hardie, euen so in dishonest thynges it maketh theim desperate. Wherfore I shall not neede to perswade, how muche vanitee is therin. And yet whan I consider, how the learned men compare the earth vnto the firmament, as a small poincte almoste inuisible: I can not chose but aske, wheather our fame can passe the termes of this poinct or not? I beleue no. Or rather I beleue, that it can not extende to the full termes therof: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the more parte of this poincte is occupied of waters: and of that parte that yet remaineth drie, no small porci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is without habitacion. Because the heauens dooe not allowe the sites therof to susteygne man, either for the extreme heate, or for the extreme colde, besides the numbres of desertes that are occupied with wilde beastes: In suche wise that of this poinct there resteth a small parte inhabited. And yet for all that the same small parte is deuyded into so many nacions, that I thynke there be no one nacion, that knoweth all the rest, nor that is knowen vnto all the rest. Furthermore the tonges be so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, that I doubt wheater there be so
<pb facs="tcp:20429:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
many diuers kyndes of beastes, as there be langages of men. Besides that, the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes of cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treis do so much vary, that the thyng whiche is commendable one where, is not allowable an other where. And what shall I saie than to theim, that (vnderstanding one tonge) are very few of a whole nacion that can skylle of the memorie of antiquitees? or to whose eares the notable auncient thynges are rehersed? All whiche thynges consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, I rest in maner astonied with my selfe, to thynke how after the diuision of this poynct, the fame of the moste fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouse hath hir feathers so clipped, that hir whynges woull not beare hir to flie through a small parte of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauntes of the least poynct of that other poinct.

Of impassible he made hym selfe passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to delyuer vs from passion, beyng pure and vncreate, he toke on hym an earthelie bodie, to make our soules and bodies glorified: He dwelled in the erth to make vs citisins of heauen: He suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred hunger and thyrst to feede vs with <hi>Ambrosia,</hi> and with angelles foode: He suffred him selfe to be tempted of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, to deliuer vs from his temptacions: He wolde be taken and bounde, to loose and deliuer vs out of the chaines of our enemie: He suffred him selfe to be scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and tourmented, to drawe vs out of peine and tourmentes: He refused not to be reised vp on the crosse, to reise vs vnto eternall triumph: Nor yet refused to be wounded with speare and nayles, to heale our incurable woundes: he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a crowne of prickyng thornes, to crowne vs with the crowne of glory: he willed to die, to purchace our lifes: and descended vnto hell, to make vs ascende vnto heauen. These thynges hath our sauiour dooen for our loue, besydes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite others, whiche I shulde not be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reherse, though well I had all the tounges bothe of men and of angelles. And yet for all the feruent loue that he
<pb facs="tcp:20429:34"/>
hath borne vs, and for all the wonders that he hath doen and suffred for vs, he requyreth no more of vs but loue, and how? Not for him selfe alone, but in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that we are his, he hath entred into our company, and rekenyng him selfe as one of vs, hath willed vs in louyng one an other, to loue hym amongest our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes. But peraduenture some may thinke this an harde commandement, that we should loue no lesse amongest our selfes, than as he hath loued vs: because his loue beyng infinite, it is impossible our loue shoulde be equall therunto. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is to be noted, that Iesu Christe, who descended from the boasome of the eternall father into this vale of miserie, to make vs an easie waie vnto paradise, neither commaundeth vs impossibilitee, nor yet any thyng that shoulde be ouer harde for vs to fulfill. For he saieth not, that we shuld loue so muche amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest our selfes, as he hath loued vs: but that we shuld loue togethers in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as he hath loued vs, as it were to saie.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> Woull not that you loue togethers as worldly men are wont to dooe, whose workes and loue tende pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prely vnto theyr owne wealth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite. For all the benefites that they doe towardes theyr neighbours, are doen in hope of some delite, profite or honour, that shulde folow therof. I woull not (saieth Christ) that you loue after that sorte, but you ought to loue together, as you haue seen me loue you, whiche hath ben not for mine owne interest, but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for your wealth, your benefite, and your exaltacion. So than shall you loue togethers, that eche man shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to helpe other without respect vnto any interest of his owne: and so (in mine opinion) shall we fulfill the sentence of those wordes of our sauiour, whan this loue amongest our selfes is free and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall, and not vttered of purpose as a merchaundise. Finally it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to consider the vnspeakeable boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, the incomparable benignitee, and the incomprehensible loue of Christ to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
<pb facs="tcp:20429:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vs, who not contented by his owne exaumple to prouoke vs curtes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to loue togethers, hath yet further bounde hym selfe, for the loue amongest our selfes, and for the charitee that we shalbe knitte togethers in, to reward vs most largelie, saiyng: If we helpe one an other in our necessitees, if we visite one an other, and receiue one an other, all the good that we shall doe vnto our neighbours, we shall doe vnto hym: and there shall not be one draught of colde water geuen, but that he woull see it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. And with what rewarde? The good deede to be multiplied by an hundrethfolde, and to geue vs euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styng life withall. This shalbe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde of our loue. And our loue is it that must make vs whynges to brynge vs vp into the true waie towardes the high felicitee. For our loue and beyng in charitee togethers, is it that reiseth vs vp, and that knitteth vs vnto god, as the deerelie beloued apostle of Christe saith: god is charitee, and he that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in charitee, dwelleth in God, and god in hym.</p>

               <p>NOw hauyng founde, what the true felicitie of man is, and what is the meane and waie to brynge hym thereunto, shakyng of all these shorte worldely pleasures, the fraile corporall prosperitees, the corruptible richesse, the ambiciouse and inconstant honours, the great and perillouse lordeshippes, and the transitorie smoke of mortall fame: lette vs dispose our selfes with all our hertes and with all our myndes vnto this moste holy loue, that Christe calleth vs vnto, and vnto this moste gloriouse charitee, that knitteth vs together with God: and so louynglie togethers, lette vs feede Christ in the hungrie, geue him drinke with the thirstie, cloathe hym in the naked, herboroughe hym with the herboroughlesse, visite hym in the sicke, redeeme hym with the captiues, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hym with the deade. And this not with our handes onelie, but enforcyng vs to haue our myndes open towardes Christ, let vs teache the rude, counsaile the ignoraunt, reproue theim that erre,

comforte the afflicted, and beare paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie all iniuries, forgeuyng theim that offende vs, and praiyng for our enemies. Of all whiche thinges let vs frely make a present vnto Christe, in yeldyng vnto hym by our lyberalytee towardes our neighbours, that whiche he most libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath geuen vs. And so vnited in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritee amongest our selfes, as true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of that bodie, wherof Christ is the head, we shall finde our selfes by Christ also vnited vnto God: and with our myndes all separated from the face of these vaine, mortall and earthlie thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, attendyng onely vnto the true cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall and euerlastyng goodnesse, enflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with feruent desire therof, we shall beginne to saie vnto hym with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete,
