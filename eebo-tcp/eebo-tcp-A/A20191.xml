            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Child.</speaker>
               <p>No: For there are no accidents,

all theſe are in God as eſſentiall, and
inſeperable properties, or if you will

            <sp>
               <speaker>Child.</speaker>
               <p>Yes verely: for they are no part of

               <p>You ſaid before that God is alwaies

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Child.</speaker>
               <p>God as touching his eſſence is no

becauſe his glory and maieſtie doth

            <sp>
               <speaker>Child.</speaker>
               <p>God doth know all mens thoughts,

there is nothing paſt, or to come with
God, but all things are alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
and it is as eaſie a matter for
God to comprehend all things paſt,

            <sp>
               <speaker>Father.</speaker>
               <p>Is it not daungerous then to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

            <sp>
               <speaker>Child.</speaker>
               <p>Yes aſſuredly: For it is high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

               <p>It is a very high degrée of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie:<note place="margin">Eſay. 40.</note>

               <p>No, for the eſſence of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head

that the motion of Angels muſt

which indéede maketh them wearie
of their life, weary of the world, and

no more I that doe it, but the ſinne that

               <p>The Scriptures doe teach that a

               <p>The knowledge of the reprobate is

               <p>The knowledge of the elect is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

               <p>The knowledge of the elect is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue,

               <p>The féeling of the reprobate ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth

they humble and ſtirre mightely to

you ſee what is the workinge of
the Law in vnregenerate men: But
in the regenerate, that is ſuch as are

               <p>The Legall couenant doth really
differ from the Euangelicall, or new
couenant of Grace. For the old co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
of the Lawe was conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall,
and did no otherwiſe giue
life, and ſaluation vnto men, but
if they did performe it, and therefore
it was nothing elſe but a repetition
of that, which GOD made to
<hi>Adam,</hi> to wit if hée did eate of the
forbidden fruite hée ſhould dye, if
not, he ſhould liue: euen ſo if we kéepe
the Lawe wée ſhall liue thereby.
If not wée ſhall dye. But the
couenant of the Goſpell is frée, that
is, it doth fréely giue life to thoſe that

beléeue though they faile in doing.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>God hath promiſed to giue power

               <speaker>Child.</speaker>
               <p>They are not contrary in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
for the ſame God is the author

of eternall life the end of both; but
the contrarietie is in vs: for to vs the

liue.</hi> But the Goſpell ſayth, <hi>Beleeue
<pb facs="tcp:16838:29"/>
and thou ſhalt be ſaued.</hi> Theſe then bée
contrary to bée made righteous by

not in matter, that is, that Chriſt
and all the promiſes of remiſsion of

bound, and guilt, which béefore was

               <p>No: For the diuels may goe ſo
farre, and further too: For the diuels
doe beléeue the Scriptures to bée true.
They beléeue all the articles of the
faith: They haue excéeding great
knowledge of the will of God, and of
the whole Scripture, they beléeue that
there is a God, and that there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

and yet I hope no man will ſay
the diuels ſhall bée ſaued. Therefore

               <p>If this be true then Lord haue mercy
vpon vs, For out of doubt thouſands

               <p>The wicked may goe thus farre to

               <p>If we reſpect time then they goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
for ſo ſoone as there is fire ther

ſo ſoone hée repents; but in the order

&amp; before all other graces, becauſe it is
the roote of all things that pleaſe God.
But if we reſpect the outward mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation,
then repentance goeth bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
faith and regeneration, and all
other vertues. Becauſe it firſt of all
appeareth outwardly. For Faith is
like the ſappe of a trée that lyeth hid
within the barke: But repentance
is like the bud that ſpéedily ſheweth
it ſelfe, before either bloſſome, fruit, or
leafe appeare. Faith is like the fire
<pb facs="tcp:16838:39"/>
and repentance like the ſmooke: for
though fire bée béefore ſmooke, yet the
ſmooke ſheweth it ſelfe before the
fire.</p>

               <p>You defined repentance to bee an

               <p>No ſuch matter. But true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
doth rectifie and amend them by
remoouing the corruption: for it tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the ſadneſſe of malancholy into
Godly ſorrow, choler into good zeale,
ſoftneſſe of nature, to méekenes of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
lightneſſe, and wantonnes to chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
mirth. It reformeth euery man
according to his natural conſtitution,
not aboliſhing it, but redreſſing the

               <p>To ſpeake properly, it is not. For
the Law is not the proper cauſe, but
rather an occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, becauſe

               <p>My meaning is this, that our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

Secondly except wée muſe &amp; meditate

               <p>Yes our Lord Ieſus in his preface
doth in general termes teach all theſe
things; for hée teacheth vs to pray in
faith, feare, &amp; loue. In faith and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
becauſe God is our Father, in
feare &amp; reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, becauſe he is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.

               <speaker>Child.</speaker>
               <p>Yes certainly:<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 7.</note> As the ſcriptures do
abundantly teach vs,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 22</note> and as it may
appeare by this reaſon,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5 14.</note> that in prayer
there is the mutuall and ioynt worke

            <sp>

               <p>But yet wee ſee by experience, that
God doth not alwayes grant the petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

               <p>There bée foure reaſons hereof:<note place="margin">Eze. 14. 14</note>

                  <pb facs="tcp:16838:45"/>
Thirdly,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 9</note> becauſe hée in his déepe

               <p>Laſtly becauſe God will try their

               <p>A Sacrament is an holy ſigne or

               <p>There are but two Sacraments of

               <speaker>Child.</speaker>
               <p>Ourſacraments are not bare ſignes

            <sp>
               <speaker>Child.</speaker>
               <p>The Sacraments are ſignes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent,

to conuey Chriſt and all

            <sp>

               <p>The Papiſts charge vs that we affirme

            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>They doe falſely ſo charge vs,
for wée hold that the Godly receiue
the true and naturall body of Chriſt,
and are partakers of his very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,

<pb facs="tcp:16838:47"/>
of Chriſt himſelfe, and that in ſuch

and bone of his bone, that is, one with
him, and he with vs: Howbeit not
corporally, but in ſuch ſort as is agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

ſpiritually, and miſtically.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Child.</speaker>
               <p>Our coniunction with Chriſt is not
in imagination, &amp; conceit onely, but is
reall &amp; ſubſtantiall, though ſecret and
hard to be comprehended; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apoſtle calleth it a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.<note place="margin">Eph. 5.</note>
                  <hi>For we are tied to Chriſt by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
as the naturall members to the head
by ioynts and ſinewes, in a moſt ſecret, and
admirable manner.</hi> For wée may not
carnally conceiue of this our coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with Chriſt, as though there
were any mingling of his body and
ours, his ſubſtance and ours, or his
perſon &amp; ours: for all things that are
vnited one to another, are not ſtraight
wayes mingled; for although the
light is ioyned with the ayre, and the
<pb facs="tcp:16838:47"/>
Sunſhine with the windowes: yet
can we not therefore ſay they are min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
together. The coniunction in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
betwixt man &amp; wife, maketh
them two, one fleſh, ſo néere is it: yet
for all that, they ceaſe not to be diuers
perſons, and ſundry ſubſtance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
by couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they are one fleſh.
Such is the coniunction, and vnion
betwixt Chriſt and vs: for we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
vnited with the fleſh of Chriſt,
and are fleſh of his fleſh, and bones of
his bones: yet is all this without any
mingling or growing together of our
perſons, and ſubſtance with his: for
as the vnion of the faithfull, one with
another as members of one body, is
not by any reall mingling, or grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in theyr perſons together but by
the bond of the ſpirit: ſo it is in this

Baptiſme is a ſeale of the couenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
God &amp; vs; for in Baptiſme a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is made betwéen the Lord, and the
<pb facs="tcp:16838:50"/>
party baptiſed ſolemnly in the aſſembly
of the Church. In which couenant God
for his part promiſed Chriſt with al bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
that come by him, as that he wil be
our God, forgiue vs our ſins, &amp; reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber
our iniquities no more, &amp;c. The partie
baptiſed for his part entreth himſelfe, as
a couenant ſeruant vnto God, promiſeth
faithfull ſeruice with a renouncing of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
&amp; ſin, and whatſoeuer is againſt the
honor and glory of God: and ſo ſtandeth
bound to theſe couenants and conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.
Then this couenant being thus ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made betwixt God &amp; his new ſeruant,
is forthwith ſealed by the ſprinkling, or
dropping on of water; and thus you ſée
that Baptiſme doth confirme, and ſeale
the couenant betwixt God and vs.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Father.</speaker>
               <p>But yet wee ſee there be very few that
haue any care to keepe couenants, and to
performe that ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne promiſe which they
haue made in baptiſme before many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
yea before God and Angels.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Child.</speaker>
               <p>The greater is their condemnation, &amp;
aſſuredly they ſhal one day know to their
<pb facs="tcp:16838:51"/>
roſt, what it is to dally with God, and to
breake couenants with ſo great a king,
as all they doe, which follow their owne
wayes &amp; their owne luſts, not regarding
the commandements of God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Father.</speaker>
               <p>What is the reaſon that infants are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed,
ſith they can make no profeſsion of
faith and repentance.?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Child.</speaker>
               <p>There be foure reaſons hereof.<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 7.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt becauſe they are the ſéed of the
Church.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 14</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 39.</note> becauſe they are within the
outward couenant.<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe the promiſes belong
vnto them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, becauſe of ſuch is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heauen. For to bée borne in the
wombe of the Church, is vnto infants in
ſtead of faith and repentance; for faithfull
parents do according to the condition of
the couenant, apprehend the promiſe both
to themſelues &amp; their children, though not
all, for wée muſt leaue vnto God his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
iudgements.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Father.</speaker>
               <p>Hauing thus far ſpoken of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:16838:51"/>
of Baptiſme, let vs now proceede to
ſpeak of the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the lords ſupper,
&amp; firſt tell me what is the ſpecial vſe of it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Child.</speaker>
               <p>Firſt, it ſerueth to ſeale vnto our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
all the promiſes made in Chriſt,
and all the benefits of his death whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer;
&amp; therfore there is the ſame vſe of it,
that is of a ſeale, which is to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme and
ratifie a writing. For in outward things
men like wel of a promiſe, but better of a
writing, &amp; beſt of all of a ſeale. Now ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſacrament is, as it were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings
broad ſeale ſet to his generall &amp; frée par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For all the doctrine of the Goſpel, is
as it were an open proclamation of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
to all penitent ſinners, &amp; this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is the ſeale of the kings pardon to
ratifie &amp; confirme all the promiſes of the
Goſpell, for a word or promiſe muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
go before the ſacrament, which
it doth ſeale &amp; confirme vnto vs, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſacraments without the word of
promiſe going before, are as it were a
ſeale to a blanke.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſacrament of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
is as it were a ſecond ſeale ſet by the
<pb facs="tcp:16838:52"/>
Lords owne hand vnto the former coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
made in baptiſme which is renued
in the Lords ſupper betwixt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
&amp; the faithfull receiuer, and that by
the outward actions of eating bread, drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
wine, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Lords ſupper ſerueth to
repreſent vnto vs our continuall féeding
in the houſe of God. For as by baptiſme
we are once admitted into the houſhold
of God: ſo by the Lords ſupper is ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a daily féeding in the ſame vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt
and all the promiſes made in him, &amp; alſo
vpon the word which is our moſt ſwéet &amp;
heauenly manna.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Child.</speaker>
               <p>I receiue them with my hands, eate
them with my mouth, &amp; digeſt them with

            <sp>

            <sp>

               <p>Onely by faith, and féede of it as of a

            <sp>
               <speaker>Father.</speaker>
               <p>Is the bread, and wine then changed into
the ſubſtance of the body and bloud of
Chriſt?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Child.</speaker>
               <p>No; for that were to deſtroy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature
of a ſacrament, which muſt conſiſt both
of heauenly, &amp; earthly matter. Therefore
the bread and wine remaine ſtill in their
own forme, nature, &amp; ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but Chriſts
naturall body is in heauen. Therfore the
papiſts would make vs beléeue the moone
is made of a gréen théeſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they beare
vs in hand that bread is changed into
fleſh, and wine into bloud, and Chriſts
naturall body is really preſent in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
and yet we ſée it quite contrary
with our eyes, and a child may diſcerne
that it is neither ſo nor ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Father.</speaker>
               <p>Is there then no difference beetwixt
bread and wine in the ſacrament, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
bread and wine?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb facs="tcp:16838:53"/>
               <speaker>Child.</speaker>
               <p>There is no difference eyther in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
or forme, but only in the vſe &amp; end
whereunto they are applyed, which is to
repreſent &amp; ſignifie holy things: for wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
before they were common meat, now
they are holy ſignes, and beare the name
of that thing which they ſignifie: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
out of this action they are the ſame
with common bread.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Father.</speaker>
               <p>You ſaid euen now that Chriſts bodie
and blood and all the benefits of his death
are receiued of vs by faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tell me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whether a wicked &amp; vnfaithfull man
can receiue them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Child.</speaker>
               <p>He cannot: for if they be receiued onely
by faith, how ſhall hée receiue them that
hath no faith? the vnbeléeuers therefore
may receiue the outward ſignes, that
is, the bread and wine as wel as others,
as did <hi>Iudas:</hi> but the inward thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified,
which is the body and blood of
Chriſt, and all the benefits of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
none can receiue, but onely the
elect.</p>

               <speaker>Father.</speaker>
               <p>If this be true that all that receiue the

followeth that grace is not neceſſarily ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Child.</speaker>
               <p>True indéed: for otherwiſe the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
ſhould gaine as much by the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as the faithfull, which were moſt
abſurd, but moſt certaine it is that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
is not tyed, nor ſhut vp within
the Sacraments, neither doe they giue
grace, but onely teſtifie and aſſure, that
grace is giuen: as ſealed euidences doe
giue no lands which are otherwiſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned,
as by inheritance, friendſhip,
and money: but onely teſtifie that they
are giuen, and aſſure the quiet poſſeſſion
and enioying thereof.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Father.</speaker>
               <p>Why did God chooſe theſe creatures of
bread and wine to repreſent vnto vs the
body and blood of Chriſt, rather then
any other earthly creature?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Child.</speaker>
               <p>Becauſe there are none other earthly
creatures that can ſo fitly repreſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:16838:54"/>
our outward ſenſes, thoſe things
which God would haue vs learne by
this ſacrament.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Father.</speaker>
               <p>What be thoſe things that God would

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Child.</speaker>
               <p>By the breaking of the bread we haue
to learne, the breaking of the bodie of
Chriſt vpon the croſſe, and by powring
forth of the wine, the ſhedding of his
blood: and by the diſtributing to all that
are preſent, Chriſts communicating
himſelfe to all that will faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
him. By eating and drinking wée
learne, that as bread &amp; wine do nouriſh
our bodies in this life: ſo Chriſts body
and blood do nouriſh our ſoules to life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting:
and as the ſubſtance of bread
and wine by digeſtion paſſeth into the
ſubſtance of our bodies: euen ſo by faith,
Chriſt and wée are vnited with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
vnion, and wée made fleſh of
his fleſh, and bones of his bones: and
this is the proportion, and analogie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the ſigne &amp; the thing ſignified. For
if the ſacraments had not a certaine like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb facs="tcp:16838:54"/>
of thoſe things wherof they are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
then were they no ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
