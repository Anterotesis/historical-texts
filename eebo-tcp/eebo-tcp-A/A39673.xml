         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Find it Story'd of <hi>Anacharsis,</hi> that when one Ask'd
him, Whether the Living or the Dead were more?
He returned this Answer, <hi>You must first tell me</hi>
(saith he) <hi>in which Number I must place Sea-men;</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating
thereby, that Sea-men are, as it were, a Third
sort of Persons, to be Number'd neither with the Living
nor the Dead; their Lives hanging continually in suspence
before them. And it was anciently accounted the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
Imployment, and they little better than lost Men
that us'd the Seas. <hi>Through all my Life</hi> (saith <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>)
<hi>Three things do especially repent me: First,
That ever I reveal'd a Secret to a Woman. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That ever I remain'd one day without a Will.
Thirdly, That ever I went to any place by Sea, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I might have gone by Land. Nothing</hi> (saith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother)
<hi>is more miserable, than to see a Virtuous and
Worthy Person upon the Sea.</hi> And although Custom,
and the great Improvement of the Art of Navigation,
have made it less formidable now, yet are you no further
from death than you are from the waters, which is but a
remove of two or three inches. Now you that border so
nigh upon the confines of death and eternity every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
may well be supposed to be Men of singular Piety
and Seriousness: For nothing more composes the Heart to
such a frame, than the lively apprehensions of Eternity do:
and none have greater external advantages for that, than
<pb facs="tcp:32409:5"/>
you have. But alas! for the generality, What sort <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap>
Men are more ungodly, and stupidly insensible of eterna
concernments? Living, for the most part, as if they had
made a Covenant with death, and with hell were at agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
It was an ancient saying, <hi>Qui nescit orare, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat
navigare,</hi> He that knows not how to Pray, let him go
to Sea. But we may say now, (alas, that we may say so in
times of greater light) He that would learn to be pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ane, to
drink, and swear, and dishonour God, let him go to Sea.
As for Prayer, it is a rare thing among Sea-men, they
count that a needless-business: they see the prophane and
vile deliver'd as well as others; and therefore, What
profit is there if they Pray unto him? <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 4. As I
remember, I have read of a profane Souldier, who was
heard swearing, though he stood in a place of great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
and when one that stood by him warned him, saying,
<hi>Fellow-souldier, do not Swear, the Bullets flie;</hi> he
answer'd, <hi>They that swear come off as well as they

diligently admonisht all Men to avoid the Sea; <hi>For</hi>
(saith he) <hi>it is the School-master of all Vice and
Dishonesty.</hi> Sirs! it is a very sad consideration to me,
that you who float upon the great deeps, in whose bottom so
many Thousand poor miserable Creatures lie, whose sins
have sunk them down, not only into the bottom of the Sea,
but of Hell also, whither divine vengeance hath pursu'd
them: That you (I say) who daily float, and hover
over them, and have the roaring waves and billows that
swallow'd them up, gaping for you as the next prey, should
be no more affected with these things. Oh what a Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Voice doth God utter in the Stroms! <hi>It breaks the
Cedars, shakes the Wilderness, makes the Hinds to
Calve,</hi> Psal. 29. 5. And can it not shake your hearts
This Voice of the Lord is full of Majesty, but his Voice in
the Word is more efficacious and powerful, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. to
convince and rip up the heart. This Word is exalted
<pb facs="tcp:32409:5"/>
above all his Name, <hi>Psal.</hi> 138. 3. and if it cannot awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
you, it is no wonder you remain secure and dead, when
the Lord utters his Voice in the most dreadful storms and
tempests. But if neither the Voice of God uttered in his
dreadful Works, or in his glorious Gospel, can effectually
awaken and rouze, there is an <hi>Euroclidon,</hi> a fearful storm
coming, which will so awaken your souls, as that they shall
never sleep any more, <hi>Psal. 11. 6. Upon the wicked he
shall reign Snares, Fire and Brimstone, and an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Tempest: This is the portion of their Cup.</hi> You
that have been at Sea in the most Violent storms, never
felt such a storm as this, and the Lord grant you never
may; no Calm shall follow this Storm. There are some
among you, that, I am perswaded, do truly fear that God
in whose hand their Life and Breath is; Men that fear
an Oath, and are an honour to their Profession; who drive
a Trade for <hi>Heaven,</hi> and are diligent to secure the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Immortal souls, in the Insurance-Office above:
but for the generality, alas! they mind none of these
things. How many of you are coasting to and fro, from
one Country to another? but never think of that <hi>Heavenly</hi>
Country above, nor how you may get the Merchandize
thereof, which is better than the Gold of <hi>Ophir.</hi> How
oft do you tremble to see the foaming V,Vaves dance about
you, and wash over you? yet consider not how terrible it
will be to have all the waves and billows of God's wrath to
go over your souls, and that for ever. How glad are you,
after you have been long toss'd upon the Ocean, to descry
Land? And how yare and eagerly do you look out for it?
who yet never had your hearts warmed with the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Ioy which shall be among the <hi>Saints,</hi> when they
arrive at the <hi>Heavenly Strand,</hi> and set foot upon the
shore of Glory.</p>
            <p>O Sirs! I beg of you, if you have any regard to those
precious immortal Souls of yours, which are also imbarqued
for <hi>Eternity,</hi> whither all winds blow them, and will
<pb facs="tcp:32409:6"/>
quickly he at their Port of Heaven or Hell, that you will
seriously mind these things, and learn to steer your course
to Heaven, and improve all Winds (I mean opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and means) to waft you thither.</p>
            <p>Here you venture life and liberty, run through many
Difficulties and Dangers, and all to compass a perishing
Treasure; yet how often do you return disappointed in
your Designs? or if not, yet it is but a fading short-liv'd
Inheritance, which like the flowing Tide, for a little
while, covers the shore, and then returns, and leaves it
naked and dry again: And are not Everlasting Treasures
worth venturing for? Good Souls, be wise for Eternity:
I here present you with the Fruit of a few spare Hours,
redeemed for your sakes, from my other Studies and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
which I have put into a new Dress and Mode.
I have endeavoured to cloath Spiritual Matters in your
own Dialect and Phrases, that they might be the more
intelligible to you; and added some pious Poems, with
which the several Chapters are concluded, trying by all
means to assault your several Affections, and as the
Apostle speaks, <hi>to catch you with guile.</hi> I can say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it; I know it cannot be without its manifold im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections,
since I am conscious of so many in my self:
Only this I will adventure to say of it, That how defective
or empty soever it be in other respects, yet it is stuffed
and filled with much true love to, and earnest desires
after the salvation and prosperity of your Souls. And
for the other defects that attend it, I have only two things
to offer, in way of excuse: It is the first Essay that I
ever made in this kind, wherein I had no President:
And it was hastned, for your sakes, too soon out of my
hands, that it might be ready to wait upon you, when
you undertake your next Voyage; so that I could not
revise and polish it. Nor indeed was I sollicitous about
the stile; I consider, I writ not for Critical and Learned
Persons: my design is not to please your Fancies any
<pb facs="tcp:32409:6"/>
further, than I might thereby get advantage to profit
your Souls. I will not once question your welcome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of it: If God shall bless these Meditations to the
Conversion of any among you, you will be the Gainers,
and my heart shall rejoyce, even mine. How comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
should we shake hand with you, when you go abroad,
were we perswaded your Souls were interested in Christ,
and secured from perishing, in the New Convenant?
What life would it put into our Prayers for you, when
you are abroad, to consider that Iesus Christ is interceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for you in Heaven, whilst we are your Remembrancers
here on Earth? How quiet would our hearts be, when
you are abroad in Storms; did we know you had a special
Interest in him whom Winds and Seas obey? To conclude,
what Ioy would it be to your Godly Relations, to see you
return new Creatures? Doubtless more than if you came
home laden with the Riches of both <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Come, Sirs! set the heavenly <hi>Jerusalem</hi> upon the Point
of your <hi>New Compass;</hi> make all the Sail you can for
it; and the Lord give you a prosperous Gale, and a safe
Arrival in that Land of Rest.</p>

            <p>THE Art of Navigation, by which Islands
especially are enriched, and preserved in
safety from Forensical Invasions; and the
wonderful Works of God in the great Deep, and
Foreign Nations are most delightfully and fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> is an Art of exquisite excellency, ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity,
rarity, and mirability: But the <hi>Art of Spiritual
Navigation</hi> is the Art of Arts. It is a gallant thing
to be able to carry a Ship richly laden round the
World: but it is much more gallant to carry a Soul
(that rich loading, a Pearl of more worth than all
the Merchandise of the world) in a body (that is
liable to leaks and bruises as any Ship is) through
the Sea of this World (which is as unstable as water,
and hath the same brinish taste and salt gust which
the waters of the Sea have) safe to Heaven (the
best Haven) so as to avoid splitting upon any Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinking
Rocks, or striking upon any Soul-drowning
Sands. The Art of Natural Navigation is a very
great mystery; but the Art of Spiritual Navigation
is by much a greater mystory. Humane wisdom may
teach us to carry a Ship to the <hi>Indies;</hi> but the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
only that is from above can teach us to steer
our course aright to the <hi>Haven</hi> of <hi>Happiness.</hi> This
Art is purely of <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi> The truth is,
<hi>Divinity</hi> (the Doctrine of living to God) is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, but the <hi>Art of Soul-Navigation,</hi> revealed
from Heaven. A meer man can carry a Ship to any
<pb facs="tcp:32409:7"/>
desired <hi>Port</hi> in all the World, but no meer man can
carry a Soul to Heaven. He must be a Saint, he must
be a Divine (so all Saints are) that can be a <hi>Pilot</hi>
to carry a Soul to the <hi>fair Haven in Emanuel's land.</hi>
The Art of Natural Navigation is wonderfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
since the coming of <hi>Christ,</hi> before which time
(if there be truth in <hi>History</hi>) the use of the <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone</hi>
was never known in the world; and before the
vertue of that was revealed unto the <hi>Mariner,</hi> it is
unspeakable with what uncertain wandrings Sea-men
<hi>floated</hi> here and there, rather than <hi>sailed</hi> the right
and direct way. Sure I am, the Art of Spiritual
Navigation is wonderfully improved since the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christ: it oweth its clearest and fullest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
to the coming of Christ. This Art of Arts
is now perfectly revealed in the Scriptures of the
Old and New Testament; but the Rulers thereof
are dispers'd up and down therein. The collecting
and methodizing of the same, cannot but be a work
very useful unto Souls: Though when all is done,
there is an absolute necessity of the teachings of the
Spirit, and of the anointing that is from above, to
make Souls <hi>Artists</hi> in sailing Heavenward. The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Author</hi> of the <hi>Christians Compass,</hi> or the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
Companion,</hi> makes three Parts of this Art (as
the School-men of Divinity,) viz. <hi>Speculative,
Practical,</hi> and <hi>Affectionate.</hi> The principal things
necessary to be known by a Spiritual <hi>Sea-man,</hi> in
order to the steering rightly and safely to the <hi>Port</hi>
of Happiness, he reduceth to four Heads, answerable
to the four general Points of the Compass; making
<hi>God</hi> our <hi>North; Christ</hi> our <hi>East; Holiness</hi> our <hi>South;</hi>
and <hi>Death</hi> our <hi>West</hi> Points. Concerning God, we
must know, 1. That he is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. and that
there is but one God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 5, 6. 2. That this
God is that Supreme Good, in the enjoyment of
<pb facs="tcp:32409:8"/>
whom all true happiness lies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 6, 7. Mat. 5.
8.â€”18. 20. 3. That (Life eternal lying in God,
and he being incomprehensible and unconceivable
in Essence, as being a Spirit) our best way to eye
him is in his Attributes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 5, 6, 7. and
works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. and especially in his Son, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
4. 6. 4. That as God is a Spirit, so our chiefest,
yea only way of knowing, enjoying, serving, and
walking with him, is in the Spirit likewise, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.
24. Concerning Christ, we must know, 1. That
he is the true Sun which ariseth upon the World,
by which all are enlightned, <hi>Iohn 1. 9. Mal. 3. 2.
Luke</hi> 1. 78, 79. 2. That God alone is in him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
himself to the World, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 19. 1 Cor.
1. 30. Iohn</hi> 14. 6. 3. That Jesus Christ is only
made ours by the union and in-dwelling of himself
in us through the spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9, 10. and 6. 17.
<hi>Ioh. 16. 8, 9. 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 3. 13. 4. That the way of
the spirits uniting us to Christ, is by an act of Power
on his part, and by an act of Faith on our parts, <hi>Iohn
3. 16. last 5. 29. Eph.</hi> 3. 17. Concerning Holiness,
we must know, 1. That whoever is in Christ is a
new creature, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 17. 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 11. 2. Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is the Souls highest lustre, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 11. when
we come to perfection in Holiness, then is our Sun
at the height in us. 3. Holiness, is Christ filling
the Soul; Christ our Sun is at highest in our hearts,
when they are most holy. 4. This Holiness is that
which is directly opposite to sin: sin eclipses holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and holiness scatters sin, <hi>Heb. 7. 26. Phil. 2.
15. 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 11. Concerning Death, we must know,
1. Death is certain: the Sun of our Life will set in
Death: when our days come about to this Western<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point,
it will be night, <hi>Heb. 9. 27. Psal.</hi> 49. 7, 9.
2. If we die in our sins out of Christ, we are undone
for ever, <hi>Iob 8. 24. Phil.</hi> 1. 21. 3. It is our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighting
<pb facs="tcp:32409:8"/>
to die, but it's not our annihilating, 1 <hi>Cor.
15. Rev.</hi> 20. 12. 4. After Death comes Judgment;
all that die shall arise to be judged, either for life
or death the second time, <hi>Heb. 9. 27. Mat. 25. Heb.</hi>
6. 2. These four heads, and the particulars under
them are as necessary to be known in Spiritual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,
as the four Points of the Compass are in
Natural Navigation. The things which we ought
to do, in order to our arrival to our Happiness, our
Author makes as many as there be Points in the
Compass. And for an help to memory, we may
begin every particular with initial known Letters
on the Points of the Compass. 1. N. Never stir
or steer any course, but by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in regard of enjoying Jesus Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 24. 16.
S. and by E. Settle't Ever in your soul, as a principle
which you will never depart from, that holiness and
true happiness are in Christ and by Christ. 17. S.

36. Eceles.</hi> 9. 10. 31. N. N. W. Name Nothing
When thou pleadest with God for thy Soul, but
Christ and Free-grace, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 17. 32. N. and by
<pb facs="tcp:32409:9"/>
W. Now Welcome Christ, if at death thou wilt be
welcomed by Christ. A tender, quick, enlivened,
and enlightened Conscience, is the only Point upon
which we must erect these Practical Rules of our
Christian Compass, <hi>Heb. 13. 1. 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 12. Our
Memory, that is the <hi>Box</hi> in which this Compass must
be kept, in which these Rules must be treasured, that
we may be as ready and expert in them, as the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner</hi>
is in his Sea-compass. So much for the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
and practical parts of the Art of Soul-Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual-Navigation.
The Affectionate part doth
principally lie in the secret motions or movings of
the Soul towards God, in the Affections which are
raised and warmed, and especially appear active in
Meditation: Meditation being as it were the Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck
or Still in which the Affections heat and melt,
and as it were drop sweet spiritual Waters. The
affectionate Author of the Christians Compass doth
indeed, in the third and last part of his Undertaking,
hint at several Meditations which the spiritual Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is to be acquainted with, unto which thou hast
an excellent Supplement in this <hi>New Compass for Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
This Collection is prefixt, that at once thou
mayest view all the Compasses (both the Speculative,
Practical, and Affectionate) by which thou must
steer Heaven-ward. What further shall be added
by way of Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

Panegyrick to usher it into any honest heart: but to
stir up all, especially Sea-men, to make conscience of
using such choice helps for the promoting the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
and salvation of their Souls, for the making
of them as dexterous in the Art of Spiritual Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
as any of them are in the Art of Natural
Navigation, Consider therefore.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:32409:10"/>1. What rich Merchandize thy Soul is. Christ
assures us, one Soul is more worth than all the world.
The Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> doth as it were put the whole world
in one scale, and one soul in the other, and the world
is found too light, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 26. Shouldst thou by
skill in Natural Navigation carry safe all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the <hi>Indies</hi> into thine own Port, yea, gain the
whole world, and for want of skill in spiritual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation
lose thy soul, thou wouldst be the greatest
loser in the world. So far wilt thou be from profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by any of thy Sea-voyages. There is a plain
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> in those words of Christ, <hi>What is a man
profited if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own
soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</hi>
More is meant, than is spoken.</p>
            <p>2. What a leaking Vessel thy
body is in which this unspeakable
inconceivable rich Treasure,<note place="margin">Erasmi Chiliad, <hi>p.</hi> 299.</note> thy
soul, is embarked! O the many diseases and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
in the humors and passions,<note place="margin">The smallest Pore is a Leak wide enough to let in Death, and sink thy Vessel.</note>
that thy body is subject to! It is
above 2000 years ago, that there
have been rekoned up 300 Names
of Diseases; and there be many
under one name, and many name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
which pose the Physicians not
only how to cure them, but how to call them. And
for the affections and passions of the Mind, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
of them are no less deadly to some, than
the diseases of the body. But besides these internal
causes, there are many external causes of Leaks in
this Vessel, as<note n="*" place="bottom">In Nubia, quae est Aethiopia, venenum est cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:32409:10"/>
hostilities, and casual mishaps; very small matters
may be of great moment to the sinking of this
Vessel. The least Gnat in the Air may choak one,
as it did <hi>Adrian,</hi> a Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> a little hair in
Milk may strangle one, as it did a Counsellor in
<hi>Rome;</hi> a little stone of a Raisin may stop ones breath,
as it did the Poetical Poet <hi>Anacreon.</hi> Thus you
see what a leaking Vessel you sail in. Now the
more leaky any ship is, the more need there is of
skill to steer wisely.</p>
            <p>3. Consider what a dangerous Sea the World is,
in which thy Soul is to sail in the leaking ship of
thy body. As there are not more changes in the
Sea, than are in the World, the world being only
constant in inconstancy, <hi>The fashion of this world
passeth away,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 31. so there are not more
dangers in the Sea for ships, than there are in the
world for souls. In this world Souls meet with
Rocks and Sands, <hi>Syrens</hi> and Pyrates. Worldly
Temptations, worldly Lusts, and worldly Company
cause many to <hi>drown themselves in perdition,</hi> 1 Tim.
6. 9. The very things of this world endanger our
Souls. By worldly Objects we soon grow worldly.
It is hard to touch Pitch, and not be defiled. The
lusts of this world stain our glory, and the men of
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>is world pollute all they converse with. A man
that keeps company with the men of this world,
is like him that walketh in the Sun, tanned insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
Thus you have hinted the dangerousness of
the Sea wherein you are to sail. Now, the more
dangerous the Sea is, the more requisite it is the
Sailer be an Artist.</p>
            <p>4. Consider, what if through want of skill in the
heavenly Art of spiritual Navigation, thou shouldst
not steer thy C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>rse aright! I will instance only
in two consequents thereof. 1. Thou wilt never
<pb facs="tcp:32409:11"/>
arrive at the Haven of Happiness. 2. Thou shalt
be drowned in the Ocean of God's wrath. As true
as the Word of God is true; as sure as the Heavens
are over thy head, and the Earth under thy feet;
as sure as thou yet livest and breathest in this Air:
so true and certain it is, thou shalt never enter into
Heaven, but sink into the depth of the bottomless
pit. Am I not herein a Messenger of the saddest
Tidings that ever yet thy Ears did hear? Possibly
now thou makest a light matter of these things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou dost not know what it is to miss of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and what it is for ever to lie under the wrath
of God: but hereafter thou wilt know fully, what
it is to have thy Soul lost eternally, so lost, as that
God's mercies, and all the good there is in Christ,
shall never save it; and as God hath set and ordered
things, can never save it. Hereafter thou wilt be
perfectly sensible of the good that thou mightest have
had, and of the evil that shall be upon thee (this
is God's peculiar Prerogative, to make a Creature
as sensible of Misery as he pleaseth,) then thou wilt
have other thoughts of these things than now thou
hast.<note place="margin">Ignis Gehenne lucebit miseris, ut vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> Then the thoughts of thy mind
shall be busied about thy lost Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
both as to the pain of loss,
and the pain of sense; so that thou
shalt not be able to take any ease any
moment: then, that thy torments
may be increased, they acknowledge, the truth of
thy apprehensions, yea. the strength of them, shall
be encreased; thou shalt have true and deep appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of the greatness of that good that thou
shalt miss of, and of that evil which thou shalt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
unto thy self; and then thou shalt not be able
to choose, but to apply all thy loss, all thy misery
to thy self, which will force thee to roar out, O my
<pb facs="tcp:32409:11"/>
loss! O my misery! O my unconceivable unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable
loss and misery! Yea, for the increasing
of thy torments, thy Affections and Memory shall
be enlarged. O that, to prevent that lose and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
these things may now be known and laid to
heart! O that a blind Understanding, a stupid Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a bribed Conscience, a hard Heart, a bad
Memory, may no longer make Heaven and Hell to
seem but trifles to thee! Thou wilt then easily be
perswaded to make it thy main business here, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
an Artist in <hi>Spiritual Navigation.</hi> But to shut
up this Preface, I shall briefly acquaint <hi>Sea-men,</hi> why
they should, of all others, be Men of singular Piety
and Heavenliness, and therefore more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
study the heavenly Art of <hi>Spiritual Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
O that <hi>Sea-men</hi> would therefore consider,</p>
            <p>1: How nigh they border upon the Confines of
Death and Eternity every moment. There is but a
step, but an inch or two between them and their
Graves continually. The next Gust may over-set
them; the next Wave may swallow them up. In
one place lies lurking dangerous Rocks, in another
perilous Sands, and every-where stormy Winds,
ready to destroy them. Well may
the <hi>Sea-men</hi> cry out,<note place="margin">Terror ubique tremor, timor un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Creation is God's Voice, it is God's
excellent Hand-writing, or the Sacred
Scriptures of the Most High, to teach
us much of God, and what reasons we have to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
our Rebellion against God, and to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of obeying God only, naturally and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.
The Heavens, the Earth, the Waters, are
the three great Leaves of this Book of God, and all
the Creatures are so many Lines in those Leaves.
All that learn not to fear and serve God by the
help of this Book, will be left inexcusable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.
20. How inexcusable then will ignorant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
<hi>Sea-men</hi> be? <hi>Sea-men</hi> should, in this respect,
be the best Scholars in the Lord's School, seeing
they do more, than others, see the Works of the
Lord, and his Wonders in the great Deep, <hi>Psal.</hi>
107. 24.</p>
            <p>3. Consider how often you are nearer Heaven
than any People in the World. <hi>They mount up to
heaven,</hi> Psal. 107. 26. It has been said of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
Minister, that contradicted his Preaching in
his Life and Conversation, That it was pity he should
e're come out of the Pulpit, because he was there
as near Heaven as ever he would be. Shall it be
said of you, upon the same account, That 'tis pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

you should come down from the high-towring
Waves of the Sea? Should not <hi>Sea-men,</hi> that in
stormy Weather have their feet (as it were) upon
the Battlements of Heaven, look down upon all
earthly Happiness in this World but as base, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terish,
and worthless? The great Cities of <hi>Campania</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:32409:12"/>
Heaven, make it their main business here, once at
last to get into Heaven? What (<hi>Sea-men</hi>) shall you
only go to Heaven against your Wills? When <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
mount up to Heaven in a storm, the <hi>Psalmist</hi>
tells us, That <hi>their souls are melted because of trouble.</hi>
O that you were continually as unwilling to go to
Hell, as you are in a storm to go to Heaven!</p>
            <p>4. And lastly, Consider what engagements lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you to be singularly holy, from your singular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances
and salvations. They that go down to
the Sea in Ships, are sometimes in the Valley of the
shadow of Death, by reason of the springing of
perilous Leaks; and yet miraculously delivered,
either by some wonderful stopping of the Leak, or
by God's sending some Ship within their sight, when
they have been far out of sight of any Land; or by
his bringing their near-perishing Ship safe to shore.
Sometimes they have been in very great danger of
being taken by Pirates, yet wonderfully preserved,
either by God's calming of the Winds in that part
of the Sea where the Pirates have sail'd, or by giving
the poor pursued Ship a strong gale of Wind to run
away from their Pursuers; or by sinking the Pirates,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sometimes their Ships have been cast away,
and yet they themselves wonderfully got safe to shore
upon Planks, Yards, Masts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I might be endless
in enumerating their Deliverances from Drowning,
from Burning, from Slavery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (Sure <hi>Sea-men</hi>)
your extraordinary Salvations lay more than ordinary
engagement upon you, to praise, love, fear, obey, and
trust in your Saviour and Deliverer. I have read,
that the enthralled <hi>Greeks</hi> were so affected with their
Liberty, procured by <hi>Flaminius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> General,
that their shrill Acclamations of <gap reason="foreign">

vowed to be Servants to their <hi>Redeemers</hi> all the days

                     <p>No sooner come we into the World as Men, or as
Christians, by a natural, or supernatural Birth; but
thus we are tost upon a Sea of Troubles, Job 5. 7. <hi>Yet
Man is born to trouble, as the sparks flie upwards.</hi> The
spark no sooner comes out of the fire, but it flies up
naturally; it needs not any external force, help, or
guidance, but ascends from a principle in it self: So
naturally, so easily, doth trouble rise out of sin. There
is <hi>radically</hi> all the misery, anguish, and trouble in the
World, in our corrupt Natures. As the spark lies
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:32409:15"/>
close hid in the coals, so doth misery in sin: Every
sin draws a rod after it. And these sorrows and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
fall not only on the Body, in those breaches,
flaws, deformities, pains, aches, diseases to which it
is subject, which are but the groans of dying Nature,
and its crumbling, by degrees, into dust again; but
on all our Imployments and Callings also, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 17,
18, 19. These are full of pain, trouble, and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.
<hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 6. We earn Wages, and put it
into a Bag with holes, and disquiet our selves in vain;
all our Relations full of trouble. The Apostle speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to those that Marry, saith, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 28. Such shall have trouble in the flesh.</hi> Upon which words one
glosseth thus: Flesh and Trouble are Marry'd
together, whether we Marry or no: But they that
are Marry'd, Marry with, and Match
into new troubles:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>See Mr. Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi>'s Care-Cloth</note> All Relations
have their burdens, as well as their
comforts. It were endless to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the sorrows of this kind; and yet the troubles
of the Body, are but the body of our troubles: The
spirit of the Curse falls upon the spiritual and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
part of Man. The Soul and Body, like to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel</hi>'s
Roll, are written full with sorrows, both
within and without. So that we make the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of our lives, when we come to die, that old <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
made before <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Gen. 47. 9. <hi>Few and evil
have the days of the years of our lives been. For what
hath Man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his
heart, wherein he hath laboured under the Sun? For all his
days are sorrows, and his travel grief, yea, his heart ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
no rest in the night: This is also vanity,</hi> Eccles. 2
22, 23.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth our New Birth free us from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
though then they be sanctify'd, sweetned, and
turned into blessings to us. We put not off the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32409:15"/>
when we put on the Divine Nature; nor are
we then freed from the sense, though we be deliver'd
from the sting and curse of them. Grace doth not
presently pluck out all those Arrows that sin hath
shot into the sides of Nature, 2 Cor. 7. 5. <hi>When we
were come into Macedonia, our Flesh had no rest, but we
were troubled on every side: without were fightings, and
within were fears,</hi> Rev. 7. 14. <hi>These are they that come
out of great tribulations.</hi> The first cry of the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
Christian (says one) gives Hell an alarm, and
awakens the rage, both of Devils and Men against
him. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> acquainted those new
Converts, Act. 14. 22. <hi>That through much tribulation,
they must enter into the Kingdom of God:</hi> And we find
the state of the Church, in this World, set out (<hi>Isa.</hi>
54. 11.) by the similitude of a distressed Ship at
Sea: O <hi>thou afflicted [and tossed] with Tempests, and
not comforted.</hi> [Tossed] as <hi>Iona</hi>'s Ship was; for the
same word is there used, <hi>Ionah</hi> 1. 11. 13. as a Vessel
at Sea, stormed, and violently driven without <hi>Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Mast, Sail,</hi> or <hi>Tacklings.</hi> Nor are we to expect
freedom from those Troubles, until harboured in
Heaven, see 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 7. O what large Catalogues
of Experiences do the Saints carry to Heaven with
them, of their various Exercises, Dangers, Trials,
and marvellous Preservations and Deliverances out
of all! And yet all these Troubles without, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to those within them; from Temptations, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
Desertions, by Passion and Compassion: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
their own, there comes daily upon them the
Troubles of others; many Rivulets fall into this
Channel and Brim, yea often overflow the Banks, Psal.

                     <p>Hence should the graceless heart thus reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it self. O my Soul! into what a Sea of troubles
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:32409:16"/>
art thou lanched forth! And what a sad case thou
art in! Full of Trouble and full of Sin, and these do
mutually produce each other. And that which is the
most dreadful Consideration of all, is, That I cannot
see the end of them. As for the Saints, they suffer
in the World as well as I; but it is but for a <hi>While,</hi>
1 Pet. 5. 10. and then they shall suffer no more,
2 Thes. 1. 7. But <hi>all tears shall be wiped away from their
eyes,</hi> Rev. 7. 17. But my Troubles look with a long
Visage: Ah! they are but the beginning of sorrows,
but a parboiling before I be roasted in the flames of
God's eternal wrath. If I continue as I am, I shall
but deceive my self, if I conclude I shall be happy in
the other World, because I have met with so much
sorrow in this: For I read, <hi>Iude</hi> 7. that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> though consumed to
ashes, with all their Estates and Relations, (a sorer
Temporal Judgment than ever yet befel me) do, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that, continue still in <hi>everlasting Chains,
under Darkness, in which they are reserved unto the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Great Day.</hi> The Troubles of the Saints
are sanctified to them, but mine are fruits of the
Curse. They have spiritual Consolations to ballance
them, which flow into their Souls in the same height
and degree, as Troubles do upon their Bodies, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5.
But I am a stranger to their Comforts, and
<hi>intermeddle not with their Ioys,</hi> Prov. 14. 10. If their
hearts be surcharged with Trouble, they have a God
to go to; and when they have open'd their Cause
before him, they are eased, return with comfort, and
their <hi>Countenance is no more sad,</hi> 1 Sam. 1. 18. When
their Belly is as Bottles full of new Wine, they can
give it vent by pouring out of their Souls into their
Father's Bosome: But I have no interest in, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with this God; nor can I pray unto him
in the Spirit. My griefs are shut up like fire in my
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:32409:16"/>

a Christ also. What though I be a vile, unworthy

11. 28.</p>
                     <p>Hence also should the gracious Soul reflect sweetly
upon it self after this manner: And is the World
so full of trouble? O my Soul, what cause hast thou

others with Scorpions: Have I had no peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out:
Some have neither had peace without nor
within, but terrours round about: Or have I felt
trouble in my flesh and spirit at once? Yet have they
not been extream, either for time or measure, And
hath the World been a <hi>Sodom,</hi> an <hi>Aegypt</hi> to thee?
Why then dost thou thus linger in it, and hanker
after it? Why do I not long to be gone, and sigh
more heartily for Deliverance? Why are the thoughts
of my Lord's coming no sweeter to me, and the day
of my full deliverance no more panted for? And
why am I no more careful to maintain peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
since there is so much trouble without? Is not
this it that puts weight into all outward troubles,
and makes them sinking, that they fall upon me when
my spirit is dark or wounded?</p>

                     <p>THE Ocean is of a vast extent and depth, though
supposedly measurable, yet not to be sounded
by Man. It compasseth about the Whole Earth,
which in the account of Geographers, is Twenty one
thousand and six hundred Miles in compass; yet the
Ocean invirons it on every side, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 25. and

And for its Depth, who can discover it? The Sea
in Scripture is called, <hi>The Deep,</hi> Job 38. 30. The

                     <p>This in a lively manner shaddows forth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
and incomprehensible Mercy of our God;
whose Mercy is said to be over all his works, <hi>Psal.</hi>
145. 9. In how many sweet Notions is the Mercy
of God represented to us in the Scripture. He is
said to be <hi>Plenteous,</hi> Psal. 4. 5. <hi>Abundant,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.
3. <hi>Rich,</hi> Eph. 2. 4. <hi>in mercy;</hi> then, that his Mercies
are <hi>unsearchable,</hi> Ephes. 3. 8. <hi>High as the Heaven
above the Earth,</hi> Psal. 10. 4. Which are so high and
vast, that the whole Earth is but a small point to
them: yea, they are not only compared to the
Heavens, but to come home to the <hi>Metaphor,</hi> to the
Depths of the Sea, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 19. which can swallow
up Mountains as well as Mole-hills; and in this Sea
God hath drowned sins of a dreadful height and
aggravation, even <hi>Scarlet, Crimson (i. e.)</hi> deep dyed
with many intensive aggravations, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 18. In
this Sea was the sin of <hi>Manasseh</hi> drowned; and of
what magnitude that was, may be seen, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.
3. Yea, in this Ocean of Mercy, did the Lord drown
and cover the sins of <hi>Paul,</hi> though a Blasphemer, a
Persecutor, Injurious, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 13. None,</hi> saith

to such hath the Scepter of Mercy been stretched
forth, upon their unfeigned repentance and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9. What doth the Spirit of God
aim at, in such a large accumulation of Names of
Mercy? But to convince poor sinners of the abundant
fulness and riches of it, if they will but submit to
the terms on which it is tender'd to them.</p>
                     <p>In the vastness of the Ocean, we have also a lively
Emblem of Eternity. Who can comprehend or
measure the Ocean, but God? And who can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
Eternity, but he that is said <hi>to inhabit it?</hi>
Isa. 57. 15. Though shallow Rivers may be drained
and dried up, yet the Ocean cannot. And though
these transitory Days, Months, and Years will at
last expire and determine; yet Eternity shall not.
O! it is a long World! and amazing Matter! What
is Eternity, but a constant permanency of Persons
and Things, in one and the same State and Condition
for ever; putting them beyond all possibility of
change? The Heathens were wont to shadow it by
a Cricle, or a Snake twisted round. It will be to all
of us, either a perpetual Day or Night, which will
not be measured by Watches, Hours, Minutes. And
as it cannot be measured, so neither can it ever be
diminished. When thousands of years are gone,
there is not a minute less to come. <hi>Gerhard</hi> and
<hi>Drexelius</hi> do both illustrate it by this known simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:
Suppose a Bird were to come once in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
years; to some vast Mountain of Sand, and
carry away in her Bill one Sand in a thousand years;
O what a vast time would it be, e're that immortal
Bird, after that rate, had recovered the Mountain!
and yet in time this might be done. For there
would be still some diminution; but in Eternity
there can be none. There be three things in Time,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32409:18"/>
which are not competent to Eternity: In Time
there is a <hi>Succession,</hi> one Generation, Year, and Day
passeth, and another comes; but Eternity is a fixed
<hi>[now.]</hi> In Time there is a <hi>Diminution</hi> and wasting;
the more is past, the less to come: But it is not so
in Eternity. In time there is an <hi>Alteration</hi> of
condition and states: A Man may be poor to day,
and rich to morrow; sickly and diseased this week,
and well the next; now in contempt, and anon in
honour: But no change passes upon us in Eternity.
As the Tree falls at Death and Judgment, so it lies
for ever. If in Heaven, there thou art a Pillar, and
shalt go forth no more, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 12. If in Hell, no

Power, and Goodness of God manifested in
those Inhabitants of the Watery Region: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Seas azure and smiling face, Strange
Creatures are bred in its Womb. <hi>O Lord</hi> (saith
<hi>David) how manifold are thy works? In wisdom hast
thou made them all; the Earth is full of thy riches. So
is this great and wide Sea, wherein are things creeping
innumerable, both small and great Beasts,</hi> Psalm 104.
24, 25. And we read, Lam. 4. 3. of <hi>Sea-Monsters,
which draw out their Breasts to their young. Pliny</hi> and
<hi>Purchas</hi> tell incredible stories about them. About
the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> our Sea-men meet with
flying Fishes, that have Wings like a <hi>Rere-mouse,</hi> but
of a Silver-colour; they fly in flocks like <hi>Stares.</hi>
There are Creatures of very strange Forms and
Properties; some resembling a Cow, called by the
<hi>Spaniards, Manates,</hi> by some supposed to be the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monster
spoken of by <hi>Ieremy.</hi> In the Rivers of
<hi>Guiana, Purchas</hi> saith, there are Fishes that have four
Eyes, bearing two above and two beneath the Water
when they swim: Some resembling a Toad, and
very poisonous. How strange both in shape and
property is the <hi>Sword-fish</hi> and <hi>Thrasher,</hi> that fight

a swarm is here! and yet there are multitudes more,
in the depths of the heart! And it is no wonder, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that with this Nature, we received the spawn
of the blackest and vilest abominations. This original
lust is productive to them all, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 14. 15. Which lust,
though it be in every Man <hi>numerically,</hi> different from
that of others, yet it is one and the same <hi>speciffically,</hi> for
sort and kind, in all the Children of <hi>Adam:</hi> even as the
reasonable Soul, though every Man hath his own Soul,
<hi>viz</hi> a Soul individually distinct from another Man's, yet
is it the same for kind in all men. So that whatever
abominations are in the hearts and lives of the vilest
<hi>Sodomites,</hi> and most profligate Wretches under Heaven;
there is the same matter in thy heart out of which
they were shaped and formed. In the depths of the
heart they are conceived, and thence they crawl out of
the eyes, hands, lips, and all the members, Mat. 15.
18. 19. <hi>Those things</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>which proceed out
of the mouth, come forth from the heart, and defile a man.
For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
fornications, thefts, false-witness, blasphemies:</hi> Even
such Monsters, as would make a gracious heart trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

so monstrous, that Nature it self startles at it: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
such Monsters are generated in the depths of the

But now (as God speaks of <hi>Idumea</hi>) Isai. 34. 11. <hi>The

emptiness. The Cormorant and Bittern posses it; the Owl
and the Raven dwell in it.</hi> Yea, as <hi>Isai. 13. 21. 22. The

Sea is such a Soul! How do these Lusts rage within
them! how do they contest and scuffle for the Throne!
and usually take it by turns. For as all Diseases are
contrary to health, yet some contrary to each other,
so are Lusts. Hence poor Creatures are hurried on to
different kinds of servitude, according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

the Prophet say, <hi>The wicked is like a troubled Sea that

serv ice of sin, and less they shall have hereafter,
when they receive the wages of sin. <hi>There is no peaec

but my God doth not say so. The last issue and result

of this is Eternal Death; no sooner is it delivered of
its deceitfull pleasures, but presently it falls in travel
again, and brings forth death, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1, 15.</p>

O my Soul, at that Free-grace which hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
thee from so sad a Condition! O fall down, and
kiss the feet of Mercy that moved so freely and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
to thy rescue! Let my heart be enlarged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly

taken, and others left? Reflect, O my Soul, upon the
Conceptions and Births of Lusts, in the days of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
which thou now blushest to own. O what black
imaginations, hellish desires, vile affections, are lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there! Who made me to differ? Or, how came I
to be thus wounderfully separated? Surely, it is by
thy Free-grace, and nothing else, that I am what I
am: And by that Grace I have escaped (to mine own
astonishment) the corruption that is in the World

imployments: Yet for the most of men, how supine

all temptations) the case then were otherwise; but
we have a <hi>Traytor</hi> within, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 14, 15. as well as
a <hi>Tempter</hi> without 1 <hi>Pet. 5. 8. Our adversary the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil

devour.</hi> And like the Beasts of the Forest, poor Souls,

lagacity, wit, policy and foresight of some Men, is
summoned in to serve their Bodies, and secure their

                     <p>Lord! how doth the care, wisdom, and vigilancy
of Men in temporal and external things, condemn my
carelesness in the deep and dear concernments of my
precious Soul! What care and labour is there to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a perishing life, liberty, or treasure! When was
I thus sollicitous for my Soul, though its value be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable,
and its dangers far greater? Self-preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is one of the deepest Principles in Nature. There
is not the poorest Worm or Flie, but will shun danger
if it can: Yet I am so far from shunning those dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to which my Soul lies continually exposed, that
I often run it upon temptations, and voluntarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it to its enemies. I see, Lord, how watchful,

little by them. Have not I a Soul to save or lose
eternally, as well as they? Yet I cannot deny one flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                     <p>To the same use and office has God design'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in Man, which being rectified and regulated by
the Word and Spirit of God, is to steer and order
his whole Conversation. Conscience is as the Oracle
of God, the Judge and Determiner of our Actions,
whether they be good or evil? and it lays the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
obligatons upon the creature to obey its dictates,
that is imaginable: For it binds under the reason and
consideration of the most Absolute and Soveraign
Will of the great God. So that as often as Conscience
from the Word convinceth us of any sin or duty, it
lays such a bond upon us to obey it, as no power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Heaven can relax, or dispense with. Angels can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do it, much less Man; for that would be to exalt
themselves above God. Now therefore it is an high
and dreadful way of sinning, to oppose and rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Conscience, when it convinces of sin or duty.
Conscience sometimes reasons it out with Men, and
shews them the necessity of changing their way and
course; arguing it from the clearest and most allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Maxims of right Reason, as well as from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputable
Soveraignty of God.</p>
                     <p>As for instance: It convinceth their very Reason,
that things of Eternal Duration, are infinitely to be
preferred to all momentary and perishing things,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:32409:25"/>
                        <hi>Rom. 8. 18. Heb.</hi> 11. 26. And it is our duty to chuse them,
and make all secular and temporary concernments
to stand aside, and give place to them. Yet though
Men be convinced of this, their stubborn Will stands
out<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and will not yield up it self to the conviction.</p>
                     <p>Further, It argues from this acknowledged truth,
That all the delights and pleasures it this World, are
but a miserable portion, and that it is the highest fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to adventure an immortal soul for them, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.
25. Alas, what remembrance is there of them in
Hell? They are as the waters that pass away. What
have they left of all their mirth and jollity, but a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
sting? It convinceth them clearly also that
in matters of deep concernment, it is an high point
of wisdom, to apprehend and improve the right sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and opportunities of them Prov. 10. 5. <hi>He that
gathers in summer is a wise Son.</hi> Eccles. 8. 5. <hi>A wise
man's heart discerns both time and judgment. There is
a season to every purpose,</hi> Eccles. 3. 1. <hi>viz.</hi> A nick of
time, an happy juncture; when if a Man strikes in, he
doth his work effectually, and with much facility.
Such Seasons Conscience convinceth the Soul of, and
often whispers thus in its ear: Now, Soul, strike in
close with this motion of the Spirit, and be happy
for ever; thou maist never have such a gale for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
any more. Now, though these be allowed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims
of Reason, and Conscience inforce them strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the soul, yet cannot it prevail; the prou'd stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
Will rebels, and will not be guided by it. See

                     <p>Ah Lord! such an heart have I had before thee;
thus obstinate, thus rebellious, so uncomptrolable by
Conscience. Many a time hath Conscience thus whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered

way, as the Angel did in <hi>Balaams,</hi> or the <hi>Cherubims</hi> that
kept the way of the Tree of Life, with flaming swords
turning every way. Thus hath it stood to oppose me
in the way of my Lusts. How often hath it calmly
debated the Case with me alone? And how sweetly
hath it expostulated with me? How clearly hath it
convinced of sin, danger, duty, with strong demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration?
How terrible hath it menaced my soul, and
set the point of the threating at my very breast?
And yet my head-strong affections will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by it. I have obeyed the voice of every lust
and temptation. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3. But Conscience hath lost
its Authority with me<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Ah Lord! what a sad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

sin receives dreadful aggravations; for rebellion and
presumption are hereby added to it. I have violated

unpardonable trasgression, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 13. O how
dreadful a way of sinning is this, with opened eyes!
And as my sin is thus out of measure sinful so my
punishment will be out of measure dreadful, if I persist
in this rebellion. Lord, thou hast said, Such shall be
beaten with many stripes, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 48. Yea, Lord,
and if ever my Conscience, which by rebellion is now
grown silent, should be in judgment awakened in this
life, Oh what an Hell should I have within me! how
would it thunder and roar upon me, and surround
me with terrors!</p>
                     <p>Thy word assures me, that no length of time can
wear out of its memory what I have done, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.

Thy Consolations are incomparably sweet, and thy

longer against Conscience; the very Ship in which I
sail, is a confutation of my madness, that rush gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily

will not be commanded by it; Surely, O my Soul,
this will be bitterness in the end.</p>

and stormy Ocean, where the Wind hath its full
stroke upon them, and they are driven before it as a
wreck upon the Seas; yet, I say, that God should
preserve you there, is a work of infinite goodness and
power. That those Winds which do rend the very
Earth, Mountains, and Rocks, 1 Kings 29. 11. <hi>Breaks
the Cedars, yea, the Cedars of</hi> Lebanon, <hi>shakes the
VVilderness and makes the Hinds, to calve:</hi> which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalists
say, bring forth with greatest difficulty, <hi>Psal.</hi>
29. 5, 8, 9. Surely your preservation in such Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests,
is an astonishing work of Mercy. O how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
is this Creature, the Winds, sometimes to you?
And how doth it make your hearts shake within you?
If but a Plank spring, or a Bolt give way, you are all
lost. Sometimes the Lord for the magnifying of the
riches of his goodness upon you, drives you to such
exigencies, that, as <hi>Paul</hi> speaks in a like case, Acts
17. 20. <hi>All hopes of being saved is taken away:</hi> Nothing
but Death before your eyes. The Lord commands
a Wind out of his Treasury, bids it go and lift up
the terrible Waves; look you in upon the shore, and
drive you upon the Rocks, so that no Art can save
you; and then sends you a piece of Wreck, or some
other means to land you safe: And all this to give
you an experiment of his goodness and pity, that
you may learn to fear that God, in whose hand your
Soul and Breath is.</p>
                     <p>And it may be for present, your hearts are much
affected: Conscience works strongly, it smites you
for sins formerly committed, such cannsels of Minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
or Relations slighted. Now, saith Conscience,
God is come in this storm to reckon with thee for
these things. But alas, all this is but a morning-dew;
no sooner is that storm without allayed, but all is quiet
within too. How little of the goodness of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides
kindly and effectually upon the heart?</p>

                     <p>How often hath this glorious power and goodness
of God passed before me in dreadful storms and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests
at Sea? He hath uttered his Voice in those stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
Winds, and spoken in a terrible manner by them;
yet how little have I been affected with it? <hi>The Lord
hath his way in the whirlwind, and in the storm,</hi> Nah. 1.
3. To some he hath walked in ways of Judgment
and Wrath, sending them down in a moment to Hell;
but to me in a way of forbearance and mercy. Ah,
how often have I been upon the very brink of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
Had not God shifted or allaid the Wind, in a
moment, I had gone down into Hell. What work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Conscience were at present upon me? And
what terrible apprehensions had I then of my eternal
condition? What Vows did I make in that distress?
and how earnestly did I then beg for Mercy? But
Lord, though thy Vows are upon me, yet have I been
the same; yea, added to, and filled up the measure of
my sins. Neither the bonds of Mercy thou hast laid
upon me, nor the sacred and solemn Vows I have laid
upon my self, could restrain me from those ways of
iniquity, which then appeared so dreadful to me.</p>
                     <p>Ah Lord, what an heart have I? What love, pity,
and goodness have I sinned against? If God had but
respited Judgment so long what a mercy were it!
Sure I am, the damned would account it so; but to
give me such a space to repent, Ah what an invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Mercy is this! And do I thus requite the Lord,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 6. and pervert and abuse his goodness thus?
Surely, O my Soul, if this be the fruit of all thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations,
they are rather reservations to some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and sorer judgment. How dreadfully will Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
at last avenge the Quarrel of abused Mercy? <hi>Iosh.</hi>
24. 20. How grievously did God take it from the
<hi>Israelites,</hi> that they provoked him at the Sea, even at
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:32409:29"/>
the Red Sea? <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 7. where God had wrought
there deliverance in such a miraculous way. Even
thus have I sinned after the similitude of there trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions;
not onely against the Laws of God, but
against the Love of God. In the last storm he
shot off his <hi>VVarning-piece;</hi> in the next, he may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
his <hi>Murdering-piece</hi> against my Soul and body.
O my Soul! hath he given thee <hi>such deliverances as
these, and darest thou again break his Commandments;</hi>
Ezra 9. 13, 14. O let me pay the Vows that my lips
have uttered in my distress, lest the Lord recover his
glory from me in a way of Judgment.</p>

                     <p>Thus prudent and skilful are Men in secular and
lower matters, and yet how ignorant and unskilful in
the great and everlasting affairs of their Souls! All
their Invention, Judgment, Wit, and Memory seem
to be prest for the service of the flesh. They can
learn an Art quickly, and arrive to a great deal of
exactness in it; but in soul-matters, no knowledge at
all. They can understand the <hi>Aequator, Meridian,</hi>

of any place, South or North, measuring it by the

you the Longitude of a place, East and West, from

them so to be: The neglect of a few hours, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
loses them their passage, and proves a great
detriment to them. They know the Wind is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain

may; they are unwilling to lose one flow, or breath,
that may be serviceable to them. If a prosperous
Gale offer, and they not ready, it repents them to

                     <p>There are also seasons and gales of Grace for our
Souls; golden opportunities of Salvation afforded to
men, the neglect of which proves the loss and ruine
of Souls. God hath given unto men a day of Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which he hath <hi>limited, Heb.</hi> 4. 7. and keeps an
exact account of every <hi>Year, Month,</hi> and <hi>Day,</hi> that we
have enjoyed it, <hi>Luke 13. 7. Ier. 25. 3. Luke</hi> 19. 42.
The longest date of it can be but the time of this Life:
This is our day to work in, <hi>Iob</hi> 9. 4. and upon this
small wyre, the weight of Eternity hangs. But some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the season of Grace is ended, before the night
of Death comes; the <hi>accepted time</hi> is gone, men fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
out-live it, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 44. 2 Cor. 6. 2. Or, if
the outward means of Salvation be continued, yet
the Spirit many times withdraws from those means,
and ceases any more to strive with Men; and then
the Blessing, Power and Efficacy is gone from them,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:32409:31"/>
and instead thereof a Curse seizeth the Soul, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.
7, 8. and <hi>Ier.</hi> 6. 29.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is a matter of high importance to our
Souls, to apprehend these seasons. How pathetically
doth Christ bewail <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> upon this account?
Luke 19. 42. <hi>O that thou hadst known, at least in this
thy day, the things of thy peace! but now they are hid from
thine eyes.</hi> If a company of Sea-men be set a-shore
upon some remote, uninhabited Island, with this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
to be a-board again exactly at such an hour,
else they must be left behind: How doth it concern
them to be punctual in their time? The lives of those
men depend upon a quarter of an hour. Many a
Soul hath perished eternally (the Gospel leaving

                     <p>What golden Seasons for Salvation hast thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
O my Soul? What Halcyon-days of Gospel-light

the Spirit waited and striven with thee in vain? <hi>The

<hi>hath suffered violence.</hi> Multitudes have
been pressing into it in my days, and I my self have
sometimes been <hi>almost perswaded,</hi> and not far from
the Kingdom of God: I have gone as far as conviction
of sin and misery; yea, I have been carried by the
power of the Gospel, to resolve and purpose to turn
to God, and become a new Creature; but sin hath
been too subtil and deceitful for me: I see, my resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were but as an early Cloud, or Morning-Dew;
and now my heart is cold and dead again, setled upon
its Lees. Ah! I have cause to fear and tremble, lest
God hath left me under that Curse, <hi>Rev. 20. 11. Let
him that is filthy, be filthy still.</hi> I fear I am become as

by the streams of the Gospel, but <hi>given to salt,</hi> and
cursed into perpetual barrenness. Ah Lord, wilt
thou leave me so! and shall thy Spirit strive no more
with me? Then it had been good for me that I had
never been born. Ah, if I have trifled out this
Season, and irrecoverably lost it, then I may take up
that lamentation, <hi>Ier.</hi> 8. 20. and say, <hi>My Harvest is
past, my Summer is ended, and I am not saved.</hi>

Crane,</hi> and <hi>Swallow,</hi> know the time of their coming,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 8. 7. How brutish am I, that have not known
the time of my Visitation! O thou that art the Lord
of Life and Time, command one gracious Season more
for me, and make it effectual to me, before I go hence,
and be seen no more!</p>

                     <p>Thus hath God distributed the more rich and
precious Gifts and Graces of his Spirit among his
People: Some excelling in one Grace, some in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
though every Grace, in some degree, be in them
all; even as in <hi>Nature,</hi> though there be all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in all, yet some Faculties are in some more
lively and vigorous than in others; some have a
more vigorous eye<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> others a more ready ear, others
a more voluable tongue; so it's in <hi>Spirituals. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
excell'd in <hi>Faith, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ob</hi> in <hi>Patience, Iohn</hi> in <hi>Love.</hi>
These were their peculiar excellencies. All the
elect Vessels are not of one quantity; yet even
those that excel others in some particular Grace,
come short in other respects of those they so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the former, and may be much improv'd by
converse with such as in some respects are much
below them. The solid, wise, and judicious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
may want that liveliness of affections, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of heart, that appears in the weak; and one
that excels in gifts and utterance, may learn Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
from the very Babes in Christ.</p>
                     <p>And one principal Reason of this different distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution,
is to maintain fellowship among them all,
1 Cor. 12. 21. <hi>The Head cannot say to the Feet I
have no need of you.</hi> As in a Family, where there is
much business to be done, even the little Children
bear a part, according to their strength, Jer. 7. 18.
<hi>The children gather wood, the fathers kindle the fire, the
women knead the dough.</hi> So in the Family of Christ,
the weakest Christian is serviceable to the strong.</p>
                     <p>There be precious Treasures in these Earthen Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
for which we should trade by mutual communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The preciousness of the Treasure, should draw
out our desires and endeavours after it; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the brittleness of those Vessels in which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:32409:33"/>
they are kept, should cause us to be the more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
in our trading with them, and make the
quicker Returns: For when those Vessels (I mean
the Bodies of the Saints) are broken by Death,
there is no more to be gotten out of them. That
Treasure of Grace which made them such profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
pleasant. and desirable companions on Earth,
then Ascends with them into Heaven, where every
Grace receives its adolescence and perfection: And
then, though they be Ten thousand times more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and delightful than ever they were on Earth,
yet we can have no more communion with them, till
we come to Glory our selves. Now therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves
us to be enriching our selves by communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of what God hath dropt into us, and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them; as one well Notes.</p>

                     <p>This is a lively Emblem of the condition of the
Church, amidst all dangers and oppositions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

These <hi>Metaphorical</hi> Waves roar and beat with violence

my Church, and the [gates] of Hell shall not prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

Seats of Judicature, there sate the Judges: but yet,
these Gates of Hell shall not prevail. Nay, this Rock
is not only invincible in the midst of their violence,
but also breaks all that dash against it, Zech 12. 3.
<hi>In that day I will make</hi> Jerusalem <hi>a burthensome stone
for all people: all that burden themselves with it, shall be
cut in pieces, though all the people of the Earth be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

together against it.</hi> An Allusion to one that assays
to roul some great stone against the Hill, which at

                     <p>And the reason why it is thus firm and impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
is not from it self; for alas; so considered, it is
weak, and obnoxious to ruine; but from the almighty
Power of God, which guards and preserves it day and
night, Psal. 46. 5, 6. <hi>God is in the midst of her, she
shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right

assiduous and constant help and succour, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in all dangers, as constantly as the Sun arises.
And this assiduous succour to his people, and their
great security thereby, is set forth in the Scriptures
by a pleasant variety of Metaphors and Emblems,
<hi>Zech. 2. 5. I (saith the Lord) will be a VVall of Fire
round about it.</hi> Some think this phrase alludes to the
<hi>Cherubims,</hi> that kept the way of the Tree of Life
with flaming swords: Others, to the fiery Chariots
round about <hi>Datham,</hi> where <hi>Elisha</hi> was: but most
think it to be an allusion to an ancient custom of
Travellers in the Desarts; who to prevent the assaults
of wilde Beasts in the night, made a <hi>Circular fire</hi> round
about them, which was as a Wall to them. Thus
will God be to his people, <hi>a wall of fire,</hi> which none
can scale. So <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5. We have an excellent
Emblem of the Churches low and dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and admirable preservation. You have here,
both a <hi>Marvel</hi> and a <hi>Mystery:</hi> The Marvel was to
see a bush all on fire, and yet not consumed. The
Mystery is this: the Bush represented the sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Church in <hi>Egypt;</hi> the Fire flaming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, the grievous Afflictions, troubles, and bondage
it was in there; the remaining of the Bush uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed,
the strange and admirable preservation of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:32409:35"/>
Church in those troubles. It lived there as the three
noble <hi>Iews,</hi> untouched in the midst of a burning fiery
Furnace: And the <hi>Angel of the Lord</hi> in a flame of
fire in the midst of the Bush, was nothing else but the
<hi>Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> powerfully and graciously present
with his people, amidst all their dangers and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
The Lord is exceeding tender over them, and
jealous for them, as that Expression imports, Zech. 2.
8. <hi>He that touches you, toucheth the apple of mine eye.</hi>
He that strikes at them, strikes at the Face of God;
and at the most excellent part of the Face, the Eye;

not therefore, O my Soul, though the Hills be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved

                     <p>Lord, this hath been my manner from my Youth,
may the Carnal minded Man say; I have been la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
for the Meat that perisheth; disquieting my
self in vain, full of designs and projects for the
World, and unwearied in my endeavours to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
an earthly treasure; yet therein I have either
been checkt and disappointed by Providence; or if
I have obtained, yet I am no sooner come to enjoy
that Content and Comfort I promised my self in
it, but I am ready to leave it all, to be stript out of it
by Death, and in that day all my thoughts perish.
But in the mean time What have I done for my
Soul? When did I ever break a Night's sleep, or
deny and pinch my self for it? Ah fool that I am!
to nourish and pamper a vile Body, which must short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lie under the Clods, and become a loathsome Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kass;
and, in the mean time, neglect and undo my
poor Soul, which partakes of the Nature of Angels,
and must live for ever. I have kept others Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards,
but mine own Vineyard I have not kept: I
have been a perpetual drudge and slave to the World;
in a worse condition hath my Soul been, than others
that are Condemned to the Mines. Lord change
my Treasure, and change my Heart: O let it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
that I have been thus long labouring on the
fire, for very vanity. Now gather up my heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections

to secure a special interest in thy Blessed Self, that I
may once say, To me to live is Christ.</p>

have his people be without <hi>carefulness (i. e.)</hi> anxious
care, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 32. And to cast their care upon him,
for he careth for them,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 7. There be two
main Arguments suggested in the Gospel, to quiet
and satisfie the hearts of Saints in this particular:
The one is, that the Gift of Jesus Christ amounts to
more than all these things come to; yea, in bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, he has given that which virtually and
eminently comprehends all these inferiour mercies in
it, Rom. 8. 32. <hi>He that spared not his own Son, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
him up for us all? how, shall he not with him
freely give us all things?</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 22. All things
are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Argument is, That God gives these Temporal
Things to those he never gave his Christ unto, and
therefore there is no great matter in them: Yea, to
those, which in a little while, are to be thrust into
Hell, <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 14. Now, if God cloath and feed his
enemies, if (to allude to that, <hi>Luke 12. 28.)</hi>
he cloath this Grass, which to day is in its pride
and glory in the Field, and to morrow is cast into
the Oven, into Hell. How much more will he cloath
and provide for you that are Saints?</p>

                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:32409:38"/>This God that feeds all the Creatures, is your
Father, and a Father that never dies; and therefore
you shall not be as exposed Orphans, that are the
Children of such a Father. <hi>For he hath said, I will
never leave you, nor forsake you,</hi> Heb. 13. 3. I have
read of a good woman, that in all wants and distresses,
was wont to encourage herself with that word, 2
<hi>Sam. 22. 47. The Lord liveth.</hi> But one time being
in a deep distress, and forgetting that consolation,
one of her little Children came to her, and said,
<hi>Mother, Why weep ye so? What, is God dead now?</hi>
Which words from a Child, shamed her out of her
unbelieving fears, and quickly brought her Spirit to
rest. O Saint, whilst God lives, thou canst not want
what is good for thee.</p>
                     <p>How sweet a Life might Christians live, could they
but bring their hearts to a full subjection to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing

Soul say. Ah how faithless and distrustful have I
been notwithstanding the great security God hath
given to my Faith, both in his Word and Works!
O my Soul, thou hast greatly sinned therein, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:32409:39"/>
dishonoured thy Father! I have been worse to my
Father, than my Children are to me. They trouble
not their thoughts with what they shall eat or drink,
or put on, but trust to my care and provision for
that: Yet I cannot trust my Father, though I have
ten thousand times more reason so to do, than they
have to trust me, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 21. Surely, unless I were
jealous of my Father's affection, I could not be so
dubious of his provision for me. Ah, I should rather
wonder that I have so much, than repine that I have
no more. I should rather have been troubled that I
have done no more for God, than that I have received
no more from God. I have not proclaimed it to the
World by my Conversation, that I have found a
sufficiency in him alone, as the Saints have done, <hi>Hab.</hi>
3. 17, 18. How have I debased the Faithfulness and
All-sufficiency of God, and magnified these earthly
trifles, by my anxiety about them? Had I had more
Faith, a light Purse would not have made such an
heavy heart. Lord, how often hast thou convinced
me of this folly, and put me to the blush, when thou
hast confuted my unbelief; so that I have resolved
never to distrust thee more, and yet new exigencies
renew this corruption? How contradictory also hath
my heart and my prayers been? I pray for them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally,
and with submission to thy Will; I dare
not say to thee, I must have them; yet this hath been
the language of my heart and life. O convince me

brackish and unpleasant, yet being exhaled by

3. Besides, if it were so evil, it could in no case, or
respect, be the object of our election and desire; as in
some cases it ought to be, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 25. But it is evil,
as it is the fruit of sin, and grievous unto sense, <hi>Heb.</hi>
14. 11. But though it be thus brackish and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
in itself, yet passing through Christ, and the
Covenant, it loses that ungrateful property, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
pleasant in the fruits and effects thereof unto
believers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11.</p>
                     <p>Yea, such are the blessed fruits thereof, that they
are to account it all joy, when they fall into divers
afflictions, <hi>Iam. 1. 2. David</hi> could bless God, that
he was afflicted; and many a Saint hath done the
like. A good woman once compared her afflictions
to her children: <hi>For</hi> (saith she) <hi>they put me in pain
in bearing them; yet as I know not which child, so neither
which affliction I conld be without.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sometimes the Lord sanctifies affliction to discover
the corruption that is in the heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 2. It is
a furnace to shew the dross. Ah! when a sharp
Affliction comes, then the pride, impatiency, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
of the heart appears. <hi>Matura vexata prodit
seipsam.</hi> When the Water is stirred, then the mud
and filthy sediment that lay at the bottom rises.
Little (saith the afflicted Soul) did I think, there
had been in me that pride, self-love, distrust of God,
carnal fear, and unbelief, as I now find. O where
is my Patience, my Faith, my Glory in tribulation?
I could not have imagined the sight of Death would
have so appalled me, the loss of outward things so
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:32409:40"/>
have pierced me. Now what a blessed thing is this,
to have the heart thus discovered?</p>
                     <p>Again: Sanctified Afflictions discover the empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and vanity of the Creature. Now the Lord
hath stained its pride, and vailed its tempting splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
by this or that affliction; and the Soul sees
what an empty, shallow, deceitful thing it is. The
World (as one hath truly observed) is then only
great in our eyes, when we are full of sense and self:
But now Affliction makes us more spiritual, and then
it is nothing. It drives them nearer to God<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> makes
them see the necessity of the Life of Faith, with
multitudes of other benefits.</p>
                     <p>But yet these sweet fruits of Affliction do not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,
and of their own accord, spring from it:
No, we may as well look for <hi>Grapes</hi> from <hi>Thorns,</hi> or
<hi>Figs</hi> from <hi>Thistles,</hi> as for such Fruits from Affliction,
till Christ's sanctifying Hand and Art have past upon
them.</p>
                     <p>The reason why they become thus sweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
(as I noted before) is, because they run now
into another channel; Jesus Christ hath removed
them from Mount <hi>Ebal</hi> to <hi>Gerezim;</hi> they are no more
the effects of vindictive Wrath, but
paternal Chastisement.<note place="margin">Correction, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,. <hi>page.</hi> 182.</note> And (as Mr. <hi>Case</hi>
well notes) <hi>A teaching affliction
is to the Saints, the result of all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of Iesus Christ. As a King, he chastens; as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
he teacheth,</hi> viz. <hi>by chastening; and as a Priest,
he hath purchased this grace of the Father, that the dry
Rod might blossom, and bear fruit.</hi> Behold then, a
sanctified affliction is a Cup, whereinto Jesus Christ
hath wrung and prest the juyce and virtue of all his
Mediatory Offices. Surely, that must be a Cup of
generous, Royal Wine, like that in the Supper, a
Cup of Blessing to the people of God.</p>

                     <p>Hence may the unsanctified Soul draw matter of
fear and trouble, even from its unsanctified troubles.
And thus it may reflect upon it self; O my Soul,
what good hast thou gotten by all, or any of thy
afflictions? God's Rod hath been dumb to thee, or
thou deaf to it. I have not learned one holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
from it: My troubles have left me the same,
or worse than they found me; my Heart was proud,
earthly, and vain before, and so it remains still:
They have not purged out, but onely given vent to
the pride, murmur, and atheism of my heart. I have
been in my afflictions, as that wicked <hi>Ahaz</hi> was in
his, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 22. Who <hi>in the midst of his distress,
yet trespassed more and more against the Lord.</hi> When
I have been in storms at Sea, or troubles at home, my
Soul within me hath been as a raging Sea, casting up
mire and dirt. Surely this Rod is not the Rod of
God's Children. I have proved but dross in the
Furnace, and I fear the Lord will put me away as
dross, as he threatens to do by the wicked, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.
119.</p>
                     <p>Hence also should gracious Souls draw much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
and comfort amidst all their troubles.
O these are the fruits of Gods fatherly love to me!
Why should I fear in the day of evil? or tremble any
more at affliction? though they seem as a <hi>Serpent</hi>
at a distance, yet are they a Rod in hand. O blessed be
that skilful and gracious hand, that makes the Rod,
the dry Rod to blossome, and bear such precious
fruit.</p>
                     <p>Lord! what a mystery of love lies in this dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation!
That sin which first brought afflictions into
the world, is now it self carried out of the world by
affliction, <hi>Rom. 5. 12. Isa.</hi> 7. 9. O what can

                     <p>IT is a wonderful work of God, to limit and bound
such a vast and furious Creature, as the Sea;

which according to the judgment of many Learned
Men, is higher than the Earth; and that it hath a
propension to overflow it, is evident, both from its
nature and motion; were it not, that the great God
had laid his Law upon it. And this is a work where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Lord glories, and will be admired, Psal. 104.
9. <hi>Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over,
that they turn not again to cover the Earth.</hi> Which it's
clear they would do, were they not thus limitted.
So Job 38. 8. 10. 11. <hi>Who shut up the Seas with doors,
when it breake forth, as if it had issued out of the VVomb?
I brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,
and said Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further; and
here shall thy proud VVaves be staid.</hi>

                     <p>And no less is the glorious Power and Mercy of
God discovered in bridling the rage and fury of Satan
and his Instruments, that they break not in upon the
Inheritance of the Lord, and destroy it. <hi>Surely, the
wrath of man shall praise thee, and the remainder of wrath
thou shalt restrain,</hi> Psal. 76. 10. By which it is more
than hinted, that there is a World of Rage and
Malice in the hearts of wicked men, which fain would,
but cannot vent itself, because the Lord restrains, or
as the Hebrew, <hi>Girds it up.</hi> Satan is the envious
one, and his rage is great against the people of God,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 12. But God holds him and all his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
in a Chain of Providence; and it is well
for God's People, that it is so.</p>
                     <p>They are limited as the Sea, and so the Lord in a
providential way speaks to them, Hitherto shall you
go, and no further. Sometimes he ties them up so
short, that they cannot touch his people, though they
have the greatest opportunities and advantages, <hi>Psal.
105. 12, 13, 14, 15. VVhen they were but a few men
in number, yea, very few, and strangers in it; when they
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:32409:42"/>
went from one Nation to another, from one Kingdom to
another people: He suffered no man to do them wrong;
yea, he reproved Kings for their sakes, saying, Touch not
mine Anointed, and do my Prophets no harm.</hi> And
sometimes he permits them to touch and trouble his
People, but then sets bounds and limits to them,
beyond which they must not pass. That is a pregnant
Text to this purpose, <hi>Revel. 2. 10. Behold, the Devil
shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried,
and ye shall have trihulation ten days.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here are four remarkable limitations upon Satan

A limitation as to the <hi>Persons,</hi> not all, but some:
A limitation of the <hi>Punishment,</hi> a Prison, not a Grave,
not Hell: A limitation upon them as to the end;
for trial, not ruine: And lastly, as to the <hi>Duration;</hi>

this Truth, in the darkest day of trouble? Thou
seest how the flowing Sea drives to over-whelm the

its violence! Who has confin'd it to its place?
Certainly none other but the Lord. When I see it
threaten the shore with its proud, furious, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting

that glorious power of God, by which thou art kept

in the midst of such hosts of enemies, as great a
Miracle, though not so sensible, as the preservation
of those three Noble <hi>Iews</hi> in the midst of the fiery
Furnace, or <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Den of Lions? For there
is as strong a propension in Satan, and wicked men,
to destroy the Saints; as in the fire to burn, or a

no longer in a slavish fear of creatures, who can have
no power against me, but what is given them from

                     <p>This Word is as necessary to us in our way to
Glory, as a Lamp or Lanthorn is in a dark night,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 105. This is a light shining in a dark

it, and own it as a Rule, miss Heaven at last; let
them not blame the Word for misguiding them,
but their own negligent and deceitful hearts, that
shuffle in and out, and shape not their course and
conversation according to its prescriptions.</p>
                     <p>What blame can you lay upon the Compass, if you
steer not exactly by it? How many are there, that
neglecting this Rule, will coast it to Heaven by their

this Rule before you, and walk accurately by it, and
you cannot be out of your way to Heaven, Psal. 119.

my Ignorance in thy Word, and the fatal consequence

<hi>Prov. 23. 5. Why wilt thou set,</hi> (or, as it is in the
<hi>Hebrew) cause thine eyes to fly upon that which is not?
For riches certainly make themselves wings, and fly away,
as an Eagle towards Heaven.</hi> In flying to us (saith

scarce a Sparrow's wings; but in flying from us,
wings as an Eagle. And those Wings they are said
to make to themselves, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) The cause of its

stalk or grass, his riches are the flower of the grass;
his glory and outward beauty, the stalk is soon
withered, but the flower much sooner. This is
either withered upon, or blown off from it, while
the stalk abides. Many a man out-lives his estate
and honour, and stands in the world as a bare dry
stalk in the field, whose flower, beauty, and bravery
is gone: One puff of wind blows it away, one
churlish easterly blast shrivels it up, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 24.</p>
                     <p>How mad a thing is it then, for any man to be

withered, men of great Estates impoverished sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
And when, like a Meadow that is mown, they
have begun to recover themselves again (as the
phrase is) the Lord hath sent <hi>Grashoppers in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the shooting-up of the latter growth,,</hi> Amos
7. 1. Just as the Grashoppers and other Creatures
devour the second tender Herbage, as soon as the
Field begins to recover its verdure: So men, after
they have been denuded and blasted by Providence,
they begin after a while to flourish again, but then
comes some new affliction, and blasts all. None have
more frequent experience of this, than you that are
Merchants and Sea-men, whose estates are floating:
and yet such as have had the highest security in the
eye of Reason, have notwithstanding experienc'd
the vanity of these things. <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, a
potent Prince, was reduced to such a low ebb, that
he petitioned for a Prehends place in the Church of
<hi>Spire. Gallimer,</hi> King of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> was brought
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:32409:46"/>
so low, that he sent to his Friend for a spunge, a Loaf
of Bread and an Harp: a Spunge to dry up his tears,
a Loaf of bread to maintain his life, and an Harp to
solace himself in his misery. The story of <hi>Bellisarius</hi>
is very affecting: He was a man famous in his time,
General of an Army, yet having his eyes put out,
and striped of all earthly comforts, was led about,
crying, <hi>Date abolum Bellisario,</hi> Give one penny to
poor <hi>Ballisarius.</hi> Instances in History of this kinde are
infinite. Men of the greatest estates and honours,
have nevertheless become the very <hi>Ludibria Fortunae,</hi>
as one speaks, The very scorn of Fortune.</p>
                     <p>Yea, and not onely wicked men, that have gotten
their Estates by rapine and oppression, have lived to
see them thus scattered by Providence: But some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
godly Men have had their Estates, how justly
soever acquired, thus scattered by Providence also.
Who ever had an estate better gotten, better bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
or better managed, than <hi>Iob?</hi> yet all was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown

                     <p>Oh then! what a vanity is it to set the heart and
let out the affections on them! You can never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
too much upon God, nor too little upon the

Then what a reproach and shame is it to me, that the

my Soul with solid and everlasting Treasure? O that
ever a sensual lust should be more operative in them
then the love of God in me! O my Soul, thou dost
not lay out thy strength and earnestness for Heaven,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:32409:47"/>
with any proportion to what they do for the World.
I have indeed higher Motives, and a surer Reward
than they: But as I have an advantage above them
herein, so have they an advantage above me in the
strength and intireness of the principle by which they
are acted. What they do for the World, they
do it with all their might; they have no contrary
principle to oppose them; their thoughts, strength,
and affection, is entirely carried in one Channel: But

O my God! Shall not my heart bemore enlarged

                     <p>If these be the Executioners of the Lord's threatn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
how sad then is their condition that put forth
to Sea under the guilt of all their sins? O, if God
should commissionate the Winds to go after and
arrest thee for all thou owest him, where art thou
then? How dare you put forth under the power
of a Divine threat, before all be cleared betwixt
God and thee? Sins in Scripture are called debts,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 12. They are debts to God; not that we
owe them to him, or ought to sin, but <hi>Metonymically,</hi>
because they render the Sinner obnoxious to God's
Judgments, even as pecuniary debts oblige him that
hath not wherewith to pay, to suffer punishment.
All sinners must undergo the Curse, either in their
own person, according to the express letter of the
Law, <hi>Gen. 2. 17. Gal.</hi> 3. 10. or their surety, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the tacite intent of the Law, manifested
to be the mind of the Law-giver, <hi>Gen. 3. 15. Gal.</hi>
3. 13, 14.</p>
                     <p>Now he that by Faith hath Interest in his Surety,
hath his Discharge, his <hi>Quietus est,</hi> sealed in the Blood
of Christ; all Process at Law, or from the Law, is
stopt <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. But if thou be an impenitent,
persisting sinner, thy debt remains upon thine own

score. <hi>And be sure thy sin will find thee out, where-ever
thou goest,</hi> Num. 32. 23. (<hi>i. e.</hi>) God's revenging
hand for sin will be upon thee: Thou maist lose the
sight and memory of thy sin, but they lose not the
sight of thee; they follow after, as the Hound doth
the fleeting game upon the scent, till they have fetcht
thee up: And then consider, <hi>How fearful a thing it
is to fall into the hands of the living God, Heb.</hi> 10.

before the Bar of God?</p>

                     <p>O my Soul, what a case art thou in, if this be so?
Are not all thy sins yet upon thine own score? Hast
not thou mane light of Christ, and that precious
Blood of his, and hitherto persisted in thy Rebellion
against him? And what can the issue of this be at
last, but ruine? There is abundant mercy indeed for
returning sinners; but the Gospel speaks of none for
persisting and impenitent sinners. And though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
who are going on in their sins are overtaken by
Grace, yet there is no Grace promised to such as
go on in sin. O, if God should arrest me by the
next Storm, and call me to an account for all that
I owe him, I must then lie in the Prison of Hell to
all Eternity; for I can never pay the debt; nay, all
the Angels in Heaven cannot satisfie for it. Being
Christless, I am under all the Curses in the Book of
God; a Child of <hi>Hagar.</hi> Lord, pity and spare me
a little longer! O discover thy Christ unto me, and
give me Faith in his Blood, and then thou art fully
satisfied at once, and I discharged for ever. O re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
not the debt at my hand, for then thou wilt
never be satisfied, nor I acquitted. What profit,
Lord, is there in my Blood! O my soul, make hast
to this Christ, thy Refuge-City; thou knowest not
how soon the avenger of Blood may overtake thee.</p>

                        <hi>Ionah</hi> 1. 5. The Mariners cast forth the
Wares that were in the Ship into the Sea, to light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
it. And <hi>Act.</hi> 27. 18, 19. they cast out the very
tacklings of the Ship. How highly soever Men
prize such Commodities, yet reason tells them, It
were better these should perish, than Life. Satan
himself could say, Job 1. <hi>Skin for skin, and all that
a Man hath, will he give for his Life.</hi>

                     <p>And surely, it is every way as highly reasonable,
that Men should mortifie, cast out, and cut off their
dearest Lusts, rather than their Immortal Souls
should sink and perish in the Storm of God's wrath.
Life, indeed, is a precious Treasure, and highly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
by Men: You know what <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Eccles.</hi>
9. 4. That <hi>a Living Dog is better than a Dead Lion.</hi>
And we find Men willing to part with their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
Limbs, or any outward Comfort, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of it. The Woman in the Gospel spent
all she had on the Physicians for her Health, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
below Life. Some Men indeed do much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
their Lives, and part with Christ and Peace of
Conscience for it; but he that thus saves it, shall
lose it. Now if Life be so much worth, What
then is the Soul worth? Alas! Life is but a <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,
which appeareth for a little while, and then va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth

                     <p>Life indeed is more worth than all the World, but
my Soul is more worth than Ten thousand Lives.
Nature teacheth you to value the first so high, and
<hi>Grace</hi> should teach you to value the second much
higher, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 26. Now here is the case: Either
you must part with your Sins, or with your Souls; if
these be not cast out, both must sink together. <hi>If

my Sin; O my Soul, this foolish pity, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
Indulgence will be thy ruine: If I spare it, God
hath said, <hi>He will not spare me,</hi> Deut. 26. 20. It is
true, the pains of Mortification are sharp, but yet
it's easier than the pains of Hell. To cut off a right
hand, or pluck out a right eye, is hard; but to have
my Soul cut off eternally from God, is harder. Is
it as easie (O my Soul!) to burn for them in Hell,
as to Mortifie them on Earth? Surely, it is <hi>profitable
for me, that one member perish, rather than that all be
cast into Hell,</hi> Mat. 5. 24. I see the Merchant wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to part with rich Wares, if embarqued with
them in a Storm: And those that have Gangreen'd
Legs or Arms, willingly stretch them out to be cut
off, to preserve Life: And shall I be willing to
endure no difficulties for my Soul? Christ reckon'd
Souls worth his Blood; And is it not worth my
Self-denyal? Lord, let me not warm a Snake in
my Bosom, that will at last sting me to the heart.</p>

                     <p>WHen the Sea works, and is tempestuous, it is
not in the power of any Creature to appease
it. When the <hi>Egyptians</hi> would by their Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks
express an Impossibility, they did it by the
Picture of a Man treading upon the Waves. It is
storied of <hi>Canute,</hi> an ancient <hi>Danish</hi> King, That
when a mighty storm of Flattery arose upon him,
he appeased it by shewing that he could not appease
the Sea: But one of his Courtiers told him, as he
rode near the Sea-side, <hi>That he was Lord of the Sea,
as well as Land. Well,</hi> said the King, <hi>we shall see that

a loud Voice cried, <hi>O ye Seas and Waves, come no
further, touch not my feet.</hi> But the Sea came up, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that charge, and confuted the flattery.
But now Jesus Christ hath the command of them
indeed: It is said of him, Mat. 8. 26. <hi>That he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked
them.</hi> And <hi>Mark.</hi> 4. 38. He quiets them with

                     <p>Conscience, when awakened by the terrors of the
Lord, is like a raging tempestuous Sea; so it works,
so it roars; and it is not in the power of all the
Creatures to hush or quiet it. Spiritual Terrors, as
well as spiritual Consolations, are not known till
felt. O when the Arrows of the Almighty are shot
into the Spirit, and the Terrors of God set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in array against the Soul; when the Venome
of those Arrows drink up the Spirits, and those
Armies of Terrours charge violently and successively
upon it, as <hi>Iob</hi> 6. 4. What Creature then is able to
stand before them! Even God's own dear Children
have felt such Terrours, as have <hi>distracted them,</hi> Psal.
81. 15. Conscience is the seat of Guilt. It is like
a Burning-glass, so it contracts the Beams of the
Threatnings, twists them together, and reflects them
on the Soul, until it smoke, scorch, and flame. If
the wrath of a King be like the roaring of a Lion,
then what is the Almighties wrath! which is <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wrath,</hi> Job 19. 11. <hi>Tearing wrath,</hi> Psal. 50. 22.
<hi>Surprizing wrath,</hi> Job 20. 23. And <hi>abiding wrath,</hi>
Job 3. 36.</p>
                     <p>In this case no Creature can relieve, all are Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
of no value; some under these terrors, have
thought Hell more tolerable, and by a violent hand
have thrust themselves out of the World into it, to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:32409:51"/>
avoid these gnawings: Yet jesus Christ can quickly
calm these mystical Waves also, and hush them with
a word; yea, he is the Physician, and no-other. It
is the sprinkling of his Blood, which, like a cooling
Fomentation, allays those heats within: That
Blood of sprinkling speaks Peace, when all other
have practised upon the Soul to no purpose; and
the reason is, because he is a Person in whom God
and Man, Justice and Mercy meet, and kiss each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

Christ? Then learn, O my Soul, to understand, and
daily more and more to savour that glorious Name,
even Jesus, that delivers not only from the wrath
to come, but that which is felt here also. Oh if the
foretaste of Hell be so intolerable, if a few drops
let fall on the Conscience in this life, be so scalding
and insufferable; what is it to have all the Vials
poured out to Eternity, when there shall be nothing
to divert, mitigate, or allay it?</p>
                     <p>Here men have somewhat to abate those Terrours,

is none. O my Soul! how art thou loaded with
Guilt! And what a <hi>Magormissabib</hi> wouldst thou be,
should God rouze that sleepy Lion in thy bosom<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
My condition is not at all the better, because my
Conscience is quiet. Ah, the day is coming, when
it must awake, and will lighten and thunder terribly
within me, if I get not into Christ the sooner.
O Lord, who knows the power of thy wrath?
O let me not carry this guilt out of the World
with me, to maintain those everlasting flames?
let me give no sleep to mine eyes, nor slumber

                     <p>THE Providence of God in furnishing us with
such plenty and variety of Fish, is not slightly
to be past over. We have not only several sorts of
Fish in our own Seas, which are caught in their
Seasons; but from several parts, especially the
Western parts of <hi>England,</hi> many Sail of Ships are
sent yearly to the <hi>American</hi> parts of the <hi>VVorld;</hi> as
<hi>New-found-Land, New-England,</hi> &amp;c. Whence every
Year is brought home, not only enough to supply
our own Nation, but many thousand pounds worth
also yearly returned from <hi>Spain,</hi> and other Countries;
by which Trade many thousand Families do subsist.</p>

                        </gap>rns do we make to Heaven
for these Mercies? O what notice is taken of the
good hand of Providence, which thus supplies and
feeds us with the Blessings of the Sea? I fear there
are but few that own, act in submission to it, and
are careful to return according to received benefit.
Men do not consider, <hi>That their works are in the
hand of God,</hi> Eccles. 9. 1. And even those that
have the most immediate dependence upon Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as Merchants and Sea-men, yet are very prone
to undertake designes in the confidence of their own
wisdom and industry; not looking higher for the
blessing, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4 13. They often <hi>sacrifice to their own
net, and burn incense to their drag, because by them their
portion is fat, and their meat plenteous,</hi> Hab. 1. 16. <hi>viz.</hi>
They attribute what is due to God, unto the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:32409:53"/>
Now this is a sin highly provoking to the
Lord: for look in what degree the heart cleaves to
the second cause, in the same degree it departs from
the living God, <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. 5.</p>
                     <p>And how do you think the blessed God will take
it, to see himself thus debased, and the creature thus
exalted into his place; to see you carry your selves
to the creature as to a God, and to the Blessed God,
as to a creature. Surely, it is a great and common
evil, and such as will blast all, if not timely discover'd
and lamented. If we make flesh our arm, it's just
with God to wither and dry up the arm. Do we
not, my Brethren, look upon second causes, as if they
had the main stroke in our business? And with a
neglective eye pass by God, as if he came in but
collaterally, and on the by, into it? But certainly,
all endeavours will be unsanctified, if not succes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>It is in vain for you to rise up early, and sit up late,
and eat the bread of sorrows; for so he giveth his beloved
sleep,</hi> Psal. 127. 2. (i. e.) It is to no purpose for
men to beat their brains, tire their spirits, and rack
their Consciences for an estate. The true way of
acquiring and enjoying the Creature, is by submitting
quietly to the Will of God, in a prudent and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,

I have eyed creatures and means too much,

Oh, what a God provoking wickedness is
this! How oft hath Providence checked my carnal

the Heart, and by those continual restless sollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
weary it; and hereby he often draws Men to
commit such things as startled them in the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>All this can he do, if he find the work stick, and
meet with rubs and difficulties; yet doth he not act
to the utmost of his skill and power, at all times and
with all persons; neither indeed need he so to do,
the very propounding of an object, is enough to
some, without any further sollicitation: The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
makes an easie conquest of them.</p>
                     <p>And beside all this, his Policy much appears in the
election of place, time and instruments to tempt by:
And thus are poor Souls caught, as <hi>Fishes in an evil
Net,</hi> Eccles. 9. 12. The carnal Man is led by Sense,
as the Beast; and Satan handles and fits him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
He useth all sorts of Motives, not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
and intellective, but external and sensitive
also; as the sparkling of the Wine, when it gives
its colour in the Glass: the Harlot's beauty, whose
eye-lids are snares; hiding always the Hook, and
concealing the issue from them. He promises them
gain and profit, pleasure and delight, and all that is
tempting, with assurance of Secresie. By these he
fastens the fatal Hook in their Jawes, and thus they
are led captive by him at his Will.</p>

                     <p>And is Satan so subtil and industrious to entice
Souls to sin? Doth he thus cast out his golden baits,
and allure Souls with pleasure to their ruine? Then
how doth it behove thee, O my Soul, to be jealous
and wary! How strict a guard should I set upon
every sense! Ah, let me not so much regard how
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:32409:55"/>
sin comes towards me in the Temptation, as how it
goes off at last. The day in which <hi>Sodom</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
began with a pleasant Sun shine, but ended
in Fire and Brimstone. I may promise my self much
content in the satisfaction of my Lusts: But O, how
certainly will it end in my ruine! <hi>Ahab</hi> doubtless
promised himself much content in the Vineyard of
<hi>Naboth,</hi> but his blood paid for it in the portion of
<hi>Iezreel.</hi> The Harlots Bed was perfumed to entice
the simple young man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 17. But those
Chambers of Delight proved the Chambers of Death,
and her House the way to Hell. Ah, with what a
smiling face doth sin come on towards me in its
temptations! How doth it tickle the carnal phantasie,
and please the deceived heart? But what a dreadful
Catastrophe and Upshot hath it? The delight is
quickly gone, but the guilt thereof remains to amaze
and terrifie the Soul with ghastly forms, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
representations of the wrath of God: As sin hath
its Delights attending it to enter and fasten it, so it
hath its horrours and stings to torment and wound:
And as certainly as I see those go before it to make
away, so certainly shall I find these follow after, and
tread upon its heels. No sooner is the Conscience
awakened, but all those Delights vanish as a Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
or as a Dream when one awakes; and then
I shall cry, Here is the Hook, but where is the Bait?
Here is the guilt and horrour, but where the delight
that I was promised! And I, whether shall I now
go? Ah my deceitful Lusts! You have enticed
and left me in the midst of all miseries.</p>

                     <p>That prosperity and success in Trade is from the
blessing of God, I suppose few are so Atheistical, as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:32409:56"/>
once to deny or question. The Devil himself ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
it, Job 1. 10. <hi>Thou hast blessed the work
of his hands, and his substance is increased in the Land.</hi>
It is not in the power of any man to get Riches,
Deut. 8. 18. <hi>Thou shalt remember the Lord thy God,
for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth.</hi> It is
his Blessing that makes good men rich, and his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
that makes wicked men rich. That Maxime
came from Hell, <hi>Quisque fortunae suae faber:</hi> Every
man is the Contriver of his own Condition: Certainly,
<hi>The good of man is not in his own hand,</hi> Job 21. 16.
<hi>Promotion cometh not from the East or West,</hi> Psal. 76. 6, 7.</p>
                     <p>This being acknowledged, it is evident, that in
all disappointment, and want of success in our
Callings, we ought not to stick in second cause, but
to look higher, even to the hand and dispose of God:
For, whose it is to give the Blessing, his also it is to
with-hold it. And this is as clear in Scripture as
the other. It is the Lord that takes away the Fishes
of the Sea, <hi>Hos. 4. 3. Zeph.</hi> 1. 3. It is he that
<hi>curseth our blessings,</hi> Mal. 2. 2.</p>
                     <p>This God doth as a punishment for sin, and the
abuse of mercies: And therefore in such cases, we
ought not to rest in general complaints to, or of one
another, but search what those sins are that provoke
the Lord to inflict such Judgments.</p>
                     <p>And here I must request your patience, to bear a
plain and close word of Conviction. My Brethren,
I am perswaded these are the sins, among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

                     <p>1. Our undertaking designs without Prayer. Alas,
how few of us begin with God? Interest him in our
dealings, and ask counsel and direction at his mouth.
Prayer is that which sanctifies all employments and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:32409:56"/>
enjoyments, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. The very Heathen could
say, <hi>A Iove Principium,</hi> They must begin with God
O that we had more Prayers and fewer Oaths.</p>
                     <p>2. Injustice and Fraud in our dealings. A sin to

                     <p>3. An over-earnest endeavour after the World.
Men make this their business, they will be rich: And

neither regarding the Souls or Bodies of Men:
Scarce affording them the liberty of the Lord's Day

it is no better, and rather admire that it is no worse
with me; that my neglect of Prayer, injustice in
dealings, Earthly-mindedness, and abuse of former
Mercies, have not provoked God to strip me naked
out of all my enjoyments. Let me humbly accept
from the Lord the punishment of my Iniquities, and
lay my hand upon my mouth. And O that these
disappointments might convince me of the Creatures
vanity, and cause me to drive on another trade for
Heaven; then shall I adore thy wisdom in rending
from me those idolized enjoyments. Ah Lord, when
I had them, my heart was a perpetual drudge to
them. How did I then forget God, neglect duty,
and not mind my eternal concernments! Oh, if these
had not perished, in all probability I had perished.
My God, let my Soul prosper, and then a small
portion of these things shall afford me more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

Bullet to kill himself only; but as a Chain-shot, which
cut off all his poor miserable Posterity. Indeed, no
sin can be little, because its object against whom it is

infiniteness in it self, and hecause the price paid to
redeem us from it is so invaluable.</p>

Afflictions and Desertions seem to work against us;
but being once put into the rank and order of Causes,
they work together with such blessed instruments,

though the faces of these things, that thus agree

be, as it were, secret chains and connections of

This promise is my security, however things go

people in, who are within the Line of this promise?
All things friendly and beneficial to them, Friends
helpful, Enemies helpful, every thing conspiring and
conducing to their happiness. With others it is not
so; nothing works for their good; nay, every thing
works against it: Their very mercies are snares,
and their Prosperity destroys them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 32.
Even the blessed Gospel it self is a savour of death
to them: When evil befals them, it is <hi>an only evil,</hi> Ezek. 7. 5. that is, not turned into good to them;
and as their evils are not turned into good, so all
their good is turned into evil. As this Promise hath
an influence into all that concerns the people, so the
curse hath a influence into all the enjoyments of the
wicked. O my soul, bless the Lord, who hath cast
thy lot into such a pleasant place, and given thee
such a glorious heritage, as this promise is.</p>

intermission, therefore his preservations are so
too. But now, when they come into the <hi>Streight</hi> of
Affliction, and deadly dangers, which threaten like

room of those Comforts that they are deprived of;
so that they see God doth exchange their comforts,
and that for the better; and this supports them.
So <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3. Christ's bodily presence is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,

which was better.</p>

burdens. It is observed, that the Saints have many
times very strong and sweet Consolation, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their greatest Trials: And this is so ordinary,
that commonly, when they have had extraordinary
Consolations from God, they have then looked for
some eminent Trial. The Lord appeared to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and sealed the Covenant to him, and then put
him upon that great trial of his Faith. So the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<hi>Luke</hi> 24. 49. It was commanded them that
they <hi>should tarry in Ierusalem, till they were endowed
with power from on high.</hi> The Lord knew what an
hard providence they were like to have, and what
great oppositions and difficulties they must encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in publishing the Everlasting Gospel to the

thou shalt suffer, O my Soul; if thy God will thus be

Though I walk through the Valley of the shadow of
Death, yet let me fear no evil, whilst my God is thus
with me. Creatures cannot do what they please;
his wisdom limits and over-rules them all, to gracious
and sweet ends. If my God cast me into the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
to melt and try me, yet I shall not be consumed
there; for he will sit by the Furnace himself all the

when it hath done its work, and then will presently
withdraw the fire. O my Soul, bless and adore this

of all thine Afflictions, and not trust it in the hands
of Men or Angels!</p>

                     <p>Thus are the Judgments of God, and the Ways of
his Providence, profound and unsearchable, Psal. 36.
16. <hi>The Righteous is like the great Mountains, and thy
Iudgments are a great Deep: (i. e.)</hi> his Providences
are secret, obscure, and unfathomable; but even then,
and in those Providences, his Righteousness stands
up like the great Mountains, visible and apparent to
every eye. Though the Saints cannot see the one,
yet they can clearly discern the other, <hi>Ier. 12. 1.
Ieremiah</hi> was at a stand; so was <hi>Iob</hi> in the like case,
<hi>Iob</hi> 12. 7. So was <hi>Asaph,</hi> Psal. 73.<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and <hi>Habbakkuk,</hi>
Chap. 1. 3. These Wheels of Providence are dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for their height, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 18. There be deep
Mysteries of Providence, as well as of Faith. It may
be said of some of them, as of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles, That
they <hi>are hard to be understood.</hi> Darkness and Clouds
are round about the Throne of God: No man can
say what will be the particular issue and event of some
of his dispensations. <hi>Luther</hi> seemed to hear God say
to him, when he was importunate to know his mind
in some particular Providence, <hi>Deus sum non sequax:</hi>
I am a God not to be traced. Some Providences, like
Hebrew Letters, must be read backward, <hi>Psal.</hi> 92. 7.
Some Providences pose Men of the greatest parts and
graces. <hi>His way is in the Sea, his paths in the great
VVaters, and his foot-steps are not known, Psal.</hi> 77. 19.
Who can trace Foot-steps in the bottom of the Sea?
<hi>The Angels,</hi> Ezek. 1. <hi>Have their hands under their wings.</hi>
The hand is either, <hi>Symbolum roboris,</hi> The Symbol of
strength; or <hi>Instrumentum Operationis,</hi> The Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Action: Where these hands are put forth,
they work effectually, yea, but very secretly, they are
hid under their wings. There be some of God's
Works that are such Secrets, as that they may not be
enquired into; they are to be believed and adored,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:32409:66"/>
but not pryed into, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 33. Others that may
be enquired after, but yet are so profound, that few
can understand them, <hi>Psal. 111. 2. The works of the
Lord are great, sought out of all those that have pleasure
therein.</hi> When we come to Heaven, then all those
mysteries, as well in the Works, as in the Word of
God, will lie open to our view.</p>

the connection and dependence on his providential
dispensations? Why art thou so perplexed, O my
Soul, at the Confusions and Disorders that are in the

the Stern: And though the Vessel of the Church be
tossed and distressed in Storms of Trouble, yet it shall
not perish. Is it not enough for me, that God hath
condescended so far for my satisfaction, as to shew me
plainly the ultimate and general issue of all these

doth. However it be, yet God is good to <hi>Israel;</hi>

love. I know not how to reconcile them to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

harmonious betwixt themselves, and the certain means
of accomplishing the Promises. O what a favour is
this, that in the midst of the greatest confusions in

his people, that it shall be well with them? <hi>Amos 9.

Bodies of Men into its devouring Throat, yet is it
not the absolute Lord or Proprietor of them, but
rather a Steward intrusted with them, till the Lord
require an account of them; and then it must deliver
up all it hath received, even to a person. <hi>Revel. 20.
11, 12. And I saw the Dead, small and great stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God: and the books were opened: and another book was
open, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged
out of those things which were written in the Books, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

                     </p>
                     <p>The Doctrine of the Resurrection of the Body, is a

1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. and most clearly asserted in Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi>
26. 8. Iob 19. 25. 1 Cor. 15, &amp;c. And it is well for

a most comfortable Truth to the people of God, so

<hi>Paul</hi> to scorn when he preached it to them, <hi>Acts</hi>
17. 32. The <hi>Familists</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> at this day reject
it as a Fable. The <hi>Socinians</hi> say the same Body shall
not rise, but an aerial Body. And indeed if Men set
up Reason as the onely Judge of supernatural things,
it is incredible to think that a Body should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
that hath been burnt to ashes, and those ashes

by others. But yet this is not to be objected to
the Almighty Power of God, that gave them their

Men, but not for him. <hi>Why should it be thought a thing

if they have Sea-room enough, they are not
much dismaid; but if they find themselves near the
shoar, they look upon their condition as very
dangerous. The sight of the Shore is to them (as
<hi>Soloman</hi> speaks of the Morning in another case) like
the shadow of death, if not able to Weather it. For
one Ship swallowed up in the Ocean, may perish up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Coast.</p>

                     <p>The greatest Streights and Difficulties that many
Saints meet with in all their lives, is when they come
nearest to Heaven, and have almost finished their
Course. Heaven indeed is a glorious Place, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and Royal Mansion of the great King; but
<hi>difficilia quae pulchra.</hi> It hath a streight and narrow
entrance, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 24. O the difficulty of arriving
there! How many hard tugs in Duty! What earnest
contention and striving, even to an Agony, as that
word imports! <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 24. Multitudes put forth,
and by profession are bound, for this <hi>fair Haven;</hi> but
of the multitudes that put out, how few do arrive
there? A man may set out by a glorious profession,
with much resolution, and continue long therein; he
may offer very fair for it, and not be far from the
Kingdom of God, and yet not be able to enter at
the last, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22.</p>
                     <p>Yea, and many of those who are sincere in their
profession, and do arrive at last, yet come to Heaven
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:32409:69"/>
(as I may say) by the gates of Hell; and put in, as
a poor Weather-beaten Vessel comes into the Harbour,
more like a Wrack than a Ship, nor Mast nor Saile
left. The righteous themselves are scarcely saved,
(<hi>i. e.</hi>) they are saved with very much difficulty.
They have not all an <hi>abundant entrance,</hi> as the Apostle
speaks, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Some Persons</hi> (as one well notes) <hi>Manton</hi> on <hi>Iude</hi>
are <hi>afar off,</hi> Eph. 2. 23. (i. e.) <hi>touch p. 119.
with no care of Religion: Some come near, but never
enter; as</hi> Semiconverts, <hi>see</hi> Matth. 12. 34. <hi>Others
enter, but with great difficulty; they are saved as by fire,</hi>
1 Cor. 3. 13. <hi>Make an hard shift. But then there be
some that go in with full sail before a VVind, and have
an abundant entrance: They go triumphing out of the
world.</hi> Ah! when we come into the Narrow Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
at the very point of entrance into life, the Soul
is then in the most serious frame, all things look with
a new face. Conscience scans our evidence most crit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically;
then also Satan falls upon us, and makes his
sorest assaults and batteries. It is the last encounter;
it they escape him now, they are gone out of his reach
for ever: And if he cannot hinder their Salvation,
yet if he can but cloud their Evening, and make them
go groaning and haling out of the world, he reaches
another end by it, even to confirm and prejudice the
wicked, and weaken the hands of others that are
looking towards Religion.</p>

                     <p>If this be so, how inevitable is my perdition, may
the careless Soul say; if they that strive so much,
and go so far, yet perish at last; and if the righteous
themselves are <hi>scarcely</hi> saved, then where shall such an
ungodly Creature, as I appear? O Lord! if they that
have made Religion their business, and have been
many years pursuing a work of Mortification, have
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:32409:70"/>
gone mourning after the Lord Jesus, and walked
humbly with God; yet if some of these have such
an hard tug at last, then what will become of such a
vain, sensual, careless, Flesh-pleasing Wretch as I
have been?</p>
                     <p>Again, Do Saints find it so streight an entrance?
Then, though I have well-grounded Hopes of safe
arrival at last; yet let me look to it, that I do not
increase the difficulty. Ah! they are the things that
are now done, or omitted, that put Conscience into
such an agony then; for when it comes to review
the life with the most serious eye. O, let me not
stick my Death-bed full of Thorns, against I come to
lie down upon it. O that I may turn to the Wall,
in that hour, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 2, 3. and
say, <hi>Remember now, O Lord, I have walked before thee
in truth, and with a perfect heart,</hi>&amp;c.</p>

hearts sometime ready to sink and die within them,

difficulties. Many an hard storm they ride out, and
many streights and troubles they here encounter
with: But at last they arrive at their desired and
long expected Haven, and then Heaven rings and
resounds with their joyful acclamations. And how

see their godly relations also, (to whose conversion,

                     <p>I Have now done, and am looking to Heaven for
a blessing upon these weak Labours: what use
you will make of them, I know not; but this I know,
that the day is coming, when God will reckon with
you for this, and all other helps and means afforded
to you. And if it be not improved by you, be sure
it will be produced as a witness against you. Sirs,
I beg you in the Name of Christ, before whom both
you and I must shortly appear, that you receive not
these things in vain. Did I know what other lawful
means to use that might reach your hearts, they
should not be in vain to you; but I cannot do God's
part of the work, nor yours. Onely I request you
all, both Masters, common Men, and all others,
into whose hands this shall come, that you will lay to
heart what you read; pray unto him that hath the
Key of the House of <hi>David, that openeth and no man
shutteth,</hi> to open your hearts to give entertainment
to these truths. Alas! If you apply it not to
your selves, I have Iaboured to no purpose, the Pen
of the Scribe is in vain: But God may make such an
application of them, in one Storm or another, as may
make your hearts to tremble. O Sirs! when Death and
Eternity look you in the face, Conscience may reflect
upon these things to your horror and amazement,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:32409:73"/>
and make you cry out, as <hi>Prov. 5. 12, 13. How have I
hated knowledge, and my heart despised reproof? And
have not obeyed the voice of my Teacher, nor inclined my
ears to them that instructed me?</hi> And O what a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
shriek will such Souls give, when the Lord opens
their eyes, to see that misery that they are here
warned of! But if the Lord shall bless these things to
your Conversion, then we may say to you, as <hi>Moses</hi>
did to <hi>Zebulun,</hi> the Mariner's Tribe <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 12.
<hi>Rejoyce Zebulun, in thy going out.</hi> The Lord will be
with you which way soever you turn you selves;
and being in the bosome of the Covenant, you are safe
in the midst of all dangers. O! thou that art the
Father of Spirits, that formedst, and canst easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the heart, open thou the blind eye, unstop the
deaf ear, let the Word take hold upon the heart. If
thou wilt but say the word, these weak Labours shall
prosper, to bring home many lost Souls unto thee.

                  <p>ALthough Dedications are too often abused to a

advantage to be made of them: Partly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
Persons of VVorth and Eminency to espouse the
Interest of Religion themselves; and partly to oblige
those Readers, for whom such Books are principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
to a diligent perusal of them, by interesting such
Persons in them, for whom they have great Respects, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

on whom they have any dependance.</p>
                  <p>Vpon the first account, a Dedication would be needless
to you: for I am perswaded, you do not only in your
Iudgment <hi>approve</hi> the Design I here manage, <hi>viz.</hi> The
Reformation of the prophane and looser sort of our Sea-men;
but are also heartily willing to <hi>improve</hi> your
Interest to the uttermost for the promotion of it. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
look upon you as Persons acted by that low and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
spirit that the most of your Profession are acted by,
who little regard, if they be good Servants to them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God have any Service from them, or no, and if
<pb facs="tcp:32409:75"/>
they pay them the Wages due for their work never think
of the Wages they are to receive for their sin. You are
judged to be Persons of another spirit, who do not only
mind, but advance Christ's Interest above your own, and
negotiate for his Glory, as well as for your own gain:
And yet, herein you consult your own Interest as well as
God's: <hi>Subordinata non pugnant.</hi> Your Interest is
never more prosperously <hi>managed,</hi> or abundantly <hi>secur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
than when it is carried on in a due subordination to
God's. Their Reformation will apparently tend to your
advantage. Those sins of theirs, against which I have
here engaged, are the <hi>Jonahs</hi> in your Ships: 'tis sin that
sinks them, and drives them against the Rocks. <hi>One
sinner destroys much good,</hi> Eccles. 8. 11. How much
more a leud Crew of them conspiring to provoke God!
The <hi>death</hi> of their Lusts, is the most probable means to
give <hi>life</hi> to your Trade. And as these Counsels prosper
in their hearts, so will your Business thrive in you hands.
<hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Prosperity</hi> are married together in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
<hi>Psal. 1. 3. Onesimus</hi> was never so profitable a

<hi>Philem.</hi> vers. 11. and 16. compared. And yet if your
Interest were forced to step back, to give way to Christ's;
I hope you would (notwithstanding) rejoyce therein.
So that my present business is, not so much to perswade
you, whose hearts, I hope, God ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>h already perswaded,
to so good a work; as to make your Fames and Respects,
which are great among them, an innocent Bait to tempt
them to their Duty. And if either your Name or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
may be useful to such an end, I presume I may use
them freely, and welcome: for, sure I am, they can
never be put to a better use.</p>
                  <p>Well then, I will make bould to send this small <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture</hi>
in your Ships; and if the Return of it be but
tke Conversion of one Soul to God, I shall reckon that I
<pb facs="tcp:32409:75"/>
have made a better Voyage than you, let your Returns be
never so rich.</p>
                  <p>How these things will affect them, I know not. I do
suppose it will produce different effects upon them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the different tempers of their spirits, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as God shall command, or suspend the Blessing.
Possibly some will storm at the close and cutting Rebukes
of the Word, (for most mens Lusts are a great deal
more sensible and tender than their Consciences) and
will fondly imagine that this necessary plainness tends
to their reproach. But if none but the guilty can be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be angry at them, they will thereby reproach
themselves a great deal more than ever I intend to do.</p>

count any of them be offended, methinks these three
or four Considerations should remove that offence.</p>
                  <p>First, that if this close and plain dealing be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in order to your Cure, and you will be offended
thereat, it's better you should be offend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>d than God.
Ministers are often put upon lamentable streights,
they sail betwixt <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Charibdis;</hi> the wrat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> of
God upon one side, if we do not speak <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>, and
home, as the necessity of the Case <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>equires; and
Man's wrath, if we do: What shall we do in this
streight? Either God or you, it seems, must be
offended; and if it cannot be avoided, I shall rather
hazard your anger than Gods, and think it far more
tolerable.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If you did but see the necessity and end
of this manner of dealing with your Souls, you
would not be offended. But put it into a more
sensible case, and you will see and acknowledge it
presently. If I should see an high-bult Wall giving
way, and ready to fall upon you; would you be
angry with me, if by plucking you out of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
I should pluck your arm out of joynt? Certainly
you would not. Why this is the case here: See
<hi>Isa. 30. 13. Therefore this Iniquity shall be unto you
as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high Wall,
whose breaking cometh suddenly, at as instant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, What a madness is it to abide in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
over which all Woes and Curses hang, and
yet not be able to endure to hear of it! Why what
will it profit you to have your misery hid from your
eyes, and kept from your eares a little while? You
must see this wrath, and hear louder vollies of
Woes from your own Consciences, If you remain
in this condition. You cannot bear that from us,
which your Conscience will one of these days preach
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32409:77"/>
themselves to you, and that in a more dreadful
dialect than I have used here.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I do not charge these sins indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon all Sea-men. No, I know there are some
choice and good men amongst your men, that fear
an Oath, and hate even the garments spotted with
the flesh, who are (I question not) the credit and
glory of our <hi>English</hi> Nation, in the eyes of Strangers
that converse with them. Nor yet do I think, that
all that are wicked amongst them, are equally guilty
of all these evils; for though all that are graceless,
be equally under the dominion of <hi>Original Corruption,</hi>
yet it follows not from thence, that therefore actual
sins must reign alike in them: There is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
even among ungodly men themselves, in this
respect; which difference ariseth from their various
Customs, Constitutions, Abilities, Educations, and
the different Administrations of the Spirit, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning,
convincing, and putting checks upon
Conscience: For though God be not the <hi>Author,</hi>
yet he is the <hi>Orderer</hi> of sin. And this makes a great
disparity, even among wicked men themselves.
Some are persons of good Morals, though not
Gracious Principles, which produce a civil and sober,
though not a holy and a religious Life. And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
though they live in some one of these Lusts,
yet are not guilty of some others of them. For it
is with Original Corruption, just as it is with the
sap of the Earth, which though it be the matter of
all kind of Fruits, yet in some ground it sorts better
with one grain than with another: And so in Plants,
in one tree it becomes a Apple, in another a Cherry;
even so it is with this Original Corruption: In one
man it runs most into Swearing, in another into
Uncleanness, in a third into Drunkenness. Lust is
nothing else but the corrupt appetite of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:32409:77"/>
to some sinful object: and therefore look as it
is with the Appetite with respect to Food, so it is
with the vitiated Appetites of Souls to sin. One
man loves this Food best, and another that; there
is endless variety in that, and so in this.</p>
                  <p>Having spoken thus much to remove offence, I
shall now beg you to peruse the following Discourse.
Consider what evidence these things carry with
them. Search the alledged Scriptures, see if they be
truly recited and applied to the case in hand: And
if so, Oh tremble at the truth you read; bring forth
your Lusts that they may die the death: Will you
not part with these abominable practices till Death
and Hell make the seperation? Ah how much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is it for you, that Grace should do it! And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
many of you see not the danger, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
prize not the Remedy, I do here Request all
those that have the Bowels of Pity in them for their
poor Relations, who are sinking, drowning, perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to spread these following Cautions before
the Lord for a Blessing, and then put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their hands. And oh that all pious Masters
would perswade those that are under their charge
to buy this ensuing Treatise, and diligently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
it. And the first Caution I shall give them, is
this.</p>

which the most sober Heathens
blushed. The <hi>Spartans</hi> brought
their Children to loath it, by shewing them a

in Pleasure, yet was temperate, as <hi>Cicero</hi> observes:
Among the Heathens, he was accounted the best
man, that spent more Oyl in the Lamp, than Wine
in the Bottle. Christianity could once glory in
its professors: <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith of the Primitive
Christians, They sat not down before they prayed,
they eat no more than might suffice hunger, they
drank no more than was sufficient for temperate
men; they did so eat and drink, as those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
they must pray afterward. But now it
may blush to behold such beastly sensualists adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves with its name, and sheltring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

among the inferiour and ruder sort of them. Some
of them have gone aboard drunk, and laid the

and their marvellous preservation iu so great and

men, as it is <hi>Psal.</hi> 107. 27. and now you may see
them reeling and staggering in the streets, drowning
the sense of all those precious Mercies and Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
in their drunken Cups.</p>
                     <p>Reader, If thou be one that is guilty of this sin,
for the Lords sake, bethink thy self speedily and
weigh, with the reason of a man, what I shall now
say, in order to thy Conviction, Humiliation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
I need not spend many words, to open
the nature of this sin to you: we all grant, that
there is a lawful use of Wine and strong
Drink,<note place="margin">Qui dedit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam, dedit vinum.</note> to support Nature, not to clog
it; to cure Infirmities, not to cause them.
<hi>Drink no longer water, but use a little Wine,
for thy stomachs sake, and thine often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi>
saith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, 1 Tim.</hi> 5. 23. mark;
drink not water, but wine, <hi>sed modice</hi> (i. e.) <hi>medice;
pro remedio, non pro delicius,</hi> saith <hi>Ambrose:</hi> that is, use
it modestly, <hi>viz.</hi> Medicinally, not for pleasure, but
for Remedy. Yea, God allows it, not noly for bare
necessity, but for chearfulness and alacrity, that the
body may be more fit and expedite for duty, <hi>Prov.</hi>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:32409:79"/>
31. 7. But further no man proceeds, without the
violation of Sobriety. When men sit till Wine have
inflamed them, and reason be disturbed (for Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness
is the privation of reason, caused by immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
drinking) then do they come under the guilt
of this horrid and abominable Sin. To the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
and refreshment of nature, you may drink;
for it is a part of the Curse, to drink, and not be
satisfied: but take heed you go no further, <hi>For Wine
is a [mocker] strong Drink is raging, and whosoever is
deceived thereby is not wise,</hi> Prov. 20. 1. The Throat
is a slipery place; how easily may a sin slip through
it into the Soul? these sensual Pleasures have a kind
of inchanting power upon the Soul; and by custom
gain upon it, till they have enslaved it, and brought it
under their power. Now this is the sin against which
God hath delivered so many Precepts, and denounced
so many Woes, in his Word: <hi>Ephes. 5. 18. Be not drunken
with wine wherein is excess,</hi> Rom. 13. 18. <hi>Not in
rioting and drunkenness. not in chambering and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness,</hi>
Isa. 5. 11. <hi>Wo to them that rise early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that they may follow strong drink; that continue
until night, till wine inflame them;</hi> with many other
of dreadful importance. Now to startle thee for
ever from this abominable and filthy lust, I shall
here propound to thy Consideration these ten ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Arguments: and oh that they might stand in the
way, as the Angel did in <hi>Balaam</hi>'s, when thou art in
the prosecution of thy sensual Pleasures! And the
first is this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. It should exceedingly disswade from this
Sin, to consider that it is an high abuse of the Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Goodness of God, in affording us those sweet
Refreshments, to make our Lives comfortable to us
upon earth. In <hi>Adam</hi> we forfeited all right, to all
earthly, as will as heavenly Mercies. God might
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32409:79"/>
have taken thee from the Womb, when thou wast a
Sinner but of a span long, and immediately have sent
thee to thine own place: thou hadst no right to a
drop of water, more than what the bounty of God
gave thee. And whereas he might have thrust thee
out of the world, as soon as thou camest into it,
and so all those days of mercy thou hast had on earth,
might have been spent in howling and unspeakable
misery in Hell: Behold the Bounty and Goodness of
God in thee; I say, behold it, and wonder: He hath
suffered thee for so many years to live upon the earth,
which he hath prepared and furnished with all things
fit for thy necessity and delight; out of the earth on
which thou treadest, <hi>he bringeth forth thy food and
[VVine] to make glad thy heart,</hi> Psal. 104. 14, 15.
And dost thou thus requite the Lord? Hath Mercy
armed an enemy to fight against it with its own
Weapo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>s? Ah that ever the Riches of his Goodness,
Bounty, and Long s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ffering (all which are arguments
to lead thee to repentance) should be thus abused!
If God had not been so bountiful, thou couldst not
have been so sinful.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. It degrades a man from the honour of his
Creation, and equalizeth him to the beast that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isheth.
Wine is said to take away the heart, <hi>Hos. 4.
11. (i. e.)</hi> the wisdom and ingenuity of a man, and
so brutifies him; as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who lost the
heart of a man, and had the heart of a beast given
him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 32. The heart of a man hath is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity
and sprightliness, brave vigorous spirit in it,
capable of, and fitted for noble and worthy actions
and imployments; but his lust effeminates quenches
and drowns that masculine vigour in the puddle of
excess and sensuality. For no sooner is a man brought
under the dominion of this Lust, but the government
of Reason is renounced, which should exercise a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive
power over the Affections; and all is deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32409:80"/>
up into the hand of Lust and Appetite; and so
they act, not by discretion and reason, but by Lust
and Will, as the Beasts do by Instinct. The spirit
of Man entertains it self with intellectual and chast
Delights, the soul of a Beast is onely fitted for such
low, sensitive and dreggie Pleasures. Thou hast som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ething
of the <hi>Angel,</hi> and something of the <hi>Beast</hi> in
thee; thy Soul partakes of the nature of Angels, thy
Body of the nature of Beasts: Oh how many pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
the <hi>Beast,</hi> while they strave the <hi>Angels!</hi> God in
the first Chaper, put all the Creatures in subjection
to thee; by this Lust thou puttest thy in self Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the creature, and art brought under his power,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 12. If God had given thee the feet or head
of a beast, Oh what a misery wouldst thou have es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed
it! And is it nothing to have the heart of a
Beast? Oh consider it sadly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. It is a Sin by which thou greatly wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and abuseth thine own Body. The Body
is the Souls Instrument, it is as the Tools are to a
skilful Artificer, this Lust both dulls and spoils it, so
that it's utterly unfit for any service of him that
made it. Thy body is a curious piece. not made by
a word of <hi>command,</hi> as other Creatures, but by a word
of <hi>counsel, I am fearfully and wonderfully made, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
wrought,</hi> (saith the <hi>Psalmist</hi>) Psal. 139. 14. or
as the Vulgar: <hi>Ace pictus sum,</hi> Painted as with a Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
like a Garment of Needlework of divers colours,
richly embroydered. Look how many members, so
many wonders. There are Miracles enough (saith
one) betwixt head and foot, to fill a volume. There
is (saith another) such curious workmanship in the
eye, that upon the first sight of it some Atheists
have been forced to acknowledge a God; especially
that fifth Muscle in the eye is wonderful, whereby
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32409:80"/>
(as a learned<note n="*" place="margin">Columb. de re Anat.</note> Author observes) Man
differeth from all other Creatures, who
have but four; one to turn the eye down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
a second to hold it forward, a
third to move it to the right hand, a fourth to the
left; but none to turn it <hi>upward</hi> as a man hath. Now
judge in thy self, did God frame such a curious piece,
and enliven it with a Soul, which is a spark, a ray of
his own light, whose motions are so quick, various
and indefatigable, whose flights of reason are so
transcendent, did God, thinkest thou, send down
this curious piece, the top and glory of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the <hi>Index</hi> and <hi>Epitome</hi> of the whole world, <hi>Eccl.</hi>
12. 2. did God (I say) send down this picture of his
own perfection, to be but as a striner for meats and
drinks, a spung to suck in Wine and Beer? Or canst
thou answer for the abuse and destruction of it? By
this excess thou fillest it with innumerable diseases
under which it languisheth; and at last thy life, like
a lamp extinguisnt, being drowned with to much

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32409:81"/>
a difficult thing to recount the miseries that Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness
loads the outward man with: for look as Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
abound where there is store of Corn, so do
Diseases in the bodies of Drunkards, where crudities
do so abound: Now methinks if thou have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Drunkenness wastes and scatters thine
estate, Proverty attends excess: the Drunkard shall
be cloathed with Rags, and brought to a morsel of
bread. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath read thy fortune, Prov. 21.
17. <hi>He that loveth Wine and Oyl shall not be rich,</hi>
Luxury and Beggary are seldom far asunder. When
<hi>Diogenes</hi> heard a Drunkards house cryed to be sold;
I thought, quoth he, it would not be long ere he
vomited up his house also. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                        </gap> and the <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                        </gap>, which signifie
Luxury; the former is compounded of two words,
which signify, <hi>Thou shalt be poor;</hi> and the latter
signifies the losing of the possession of that good
which is in our hand. <hi>The Drunkard and the Glutton
shall surely come to poverty,</hi> Prov. 23. 21. In the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
it is, He shall be disinherited, or disposessed.
It doth not only dispossess a man of his Reason,
which is a rich and fair inheritance given to him by
God, but it also dispossesses him of his estate: it
wastes all that either the provident care of thy
Progenitors, or the blessing of God upon thine own
industry, hath obtained for thee. And how will
this sting like and Adder, when thou shalt consider
it? <hi>Apicius</hi> the <hi>Roman,</hi> hearing that there were
seven hundred Crowns only remaining of a fair
estate, that his Father had left him, fell into a deep
Melancholly, and fearing want, hanged himself, saith
<hi>Seneca.</hi> And not to mention the miseries and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32409:81"/>
they bring hereby upon their Families, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the tears, yea, blood of their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
Oh what an account will they give to God,
when their reckoning day comes! Believe it, Sirs,
there is not a shilling of your estates, but God will
reckon with you for the expence thereof. If you
have spent it upon your lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ts, while the necessity of
your families, or the poor, called upon you for it;
I should be loth to have your account to make, for
a thousand times more than ever you possessed. O
woful expence, that is followed with such dreadful
reckonings!</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. Consider what vile and ignominious
Characters the Spirit of God hath put upon the
subjects of this sin. The Scripture every where
notes them for infamous, and most abominable
persons. When <hi>Eli</hi> supposed <hi>Hannah</hi> to be drunken,
<hi>Count not thy hand-maid a daughter of</hi> Belial, said she,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 16. Now a Son or daughter of <hi>Belial</hi> is,
in Scripture-language, the vilest of men or women.
So Psal. 69. 12. <hi>They that sit in the gate, speak against
me, and I am the Song of Drunkards, (i. e.)</hi> of the
basest and vilest of men, as the opposition plainly
shews; for they are opposed to them that sit in the
gate, that is, honourable persons. The Lord would
have his people shun the society of such, as a pest.
Not to eat with them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. Yea, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
brands them with Atheism; they are such
as have lost the sense and expectation of the Day of
Judgment; mind not another world, nor do they
look for the coming of the Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 27, 28.
He saith the Lord delayeth his coming, and then
falls a drinking with the drunken. The thoughts
of that day will make them leave their Cups, or their
Cups will drown the thoughts of such a Day. And
will not all the contempt, shame and infamy, which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:32409:82"/>
the Spirit of God hath poured on the head, of this
sin, cause thee to abhor it? Do not all Godly, yea
Moral Persons, abhor the Drunkard? Oh methinks
the shame that attends it, should be as a fence to
keep thee from it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. Sadly consider, there can be nothing of
the sanctifying Spirit in a soul that is under the
dominion of this lust; for upon the first discovery
of the Grace of God, the Soul renounces the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Sensuality. <hi>The Grace of God that bringeth
Salvation, teacheth men to live soberly,</hi> Tit. 2. 11, 12.
That is one of its first effects. Drunkenness indeed
may be found among Heathens, that are lost in the
darkness of Ignorance; but it may not be once
named among the Children of the Day. <hi>They that
be drunken are drunken in the night; but let us that are
of the day be sober,</hi> 1 Thes. 5. 7, 8. And the Apostles
often oppose Wine and the Spirit as things incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible,
Eph. 5. 16. <hi>Be not drunk with Wine wherein
is excess, but be filled with the Spirit.</hi> So Jude 19.
<hi>Sensual, not having the Spirit.</hi> Now what a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Consideration is this: <hi>If any man have not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ the same is none of his,</hi> Rom 8. 9. Sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
persons have not the Spirit of Christ, and so can
be none of his. It's true, <hi>Noah,</hi> a Godly man, once
fell into this sin, but as <hi>Theodoret</hi> saith, and that
truly, it proceeded <hi>ab inexperientiae non ab intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perantia,</hi>
from want of experience of the force and
power of the Grape, not from Intemperance; and
besides, we find not that ever he was again over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
with that sin; but thou knowest it, and yet
persistest. O wretched Creature! the Spirit of
Christ cannot dwell in thee. The Lord help thee
to lay it to heart sadly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. It's a Sin over which many direful woes
and threats hang in the Word, like so many lowring
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:32409:82"/>
clouds, ready to power down vengeance upon the
heads of such Sinners. Look as the condition of
the Saints is compassed round with Promises, so is
yours with Threatnings, Isai. 5. 11. <hi>Wo to them that
rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong
drink, and continue until night, until VVine inflame.</hi>
So Isai. 28. 1, 2. <hi>Wo to the Crown of Pride, to the
Drunkards of</hi> Ephraim, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> With many other, too
long to enumerate here. Now consider what a
fearful thing it is to be under these woes of God:
Sinner, I beseech thee, do not make light of them,
for they will fall heavy: assure thy self, not one of
them shall fall to the ground: they will all take
place upon thee, except thou repent.</p>
                     <p>There are woes of Men, and woes of God: Gods
woes are true woes, and make their condition woful
to purpose on whom they fall. Other woes (as
one saith) do but touch the skin; but these strike
the Soul; other woes are but temporal, these are
eternal; others do only part betwixt us and our
outward comforts, these betwixt God and us for
ever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 8. Drunkenness is a leading sin, which has
a great retinue and attendence of other sins waiting
on it, it's like a sudden Land-flood, which brings a
great deal of dirt with it. So that look as Faith
excels among the Graces, because it enlivens,
actuates, and gives strength to them; so is this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
sins. It is not so much a special sin against a
single Precept of God, as a general violation of the
whole Law, (saith accurate <hi>Amesius.</hi>) It doth not
only call off the guard, but warms and quickens all
other Lusts, and so exposes the Soul to be prostitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them. (1.) It gives occasion, yea, is the
real cause of many contentions, and fatal quarrels,
Prov. 23. 29. <hi>VVho hath Wo<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> VVho hath sorrow, Who
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:32409:83"/>
hath [contention] babling, wounds without cause? They
that tarry long at the wine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Contentions</hi> and
<hi>Wounds</hi> are the ordinary effects of drunken meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
when Reason is deposed, and Lust heated,
what will not men attempt? (2.) Scoff and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of the ways and people of God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 69.
12. David <hi>was the Song of the Drunkards.</hi> (3.) It's
the great incendiary of Lust: You shall find rioting
and drunkenness joyned with chambering and
wantonness, <hi>Rom. 13. 13. Nunquam ego ebrium
castum putabo,</hi> saith <hi>Hierome,</hi> I will never think a
drunkard to be chaste. <hi>Solomon</hi> plainly tells us,
what the issue will be, Prov. 23. 33. <hi>Thine eyes shall
behold a strange woman, and thy heart shall utter perverse
things,</hi> speaking of the Drunkard. It may be called
<hi>Gad,</hi> for a troop followeth it. Hence one aptly calls
it, <hi>The Devils bridle,</hi> by which he turneth the sinner
which way he pleases: he that is overcome by it, can
overcome no other sin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 9. But if none of the former Considerations
can prevail, I hope these two last may, unless all
sense and tenderness be lost. Consider therefore in
the <hi>9th</hi> place, That Drunkards are in Scripture
marked out for Hell: the Characters of Death are
upon them. You shall find them pinioned with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sons of death, 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10. <hi>Know ye not,
that the unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of
God? Be not deceived: Neither Fornicaters, nor Idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aters,
nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor Abusers of
themselves with Mankinde, nor Thieves, nor Covetous,
nor [Drunkards,] nor Revilers, nor Extortioners, shall
inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> Oh dreadful thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt!
He is not <hi>asleep</hi> but <hi>dead,</hi> that is not startled

wrath? Oh think when the Wine sparkles in
the glass, and gives its colour, think, I say, what a
Cup of trembling is in the hand of the Lord for
thee. Thou wilt not now believe this; Oh but the
day is coming, when thou shalt know the price of
these brutish pleasures. Oh it will then sting like an
Adder. Ah! this short-lived beastly pleasure is the
price for which thou sellest Heaven, and rivers of
pleasure that are at Gods right hand.</p>

wholsome counsel can get in, till the Wine be gone

not ashamed to be drunken, he tartly replied; <hi>And
are not you ashamed to admonish a Drunkard?</hi> intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that no wise man would cast away an admonition
upon such an one. And it not only renders them
uncapable of councel for the time, but by degrees it
besots and infatuates them; which is a very grievous
stroke from God upon them, making way to their
eternal ruine. So then you see upon the whole, what
a dangerous gulph the sin of Drunkenness is. I beg
you for the Lords sake, and by all the regard you
have to your souls, bodies, and estates, beware of it.
Oh consider these ten Arguments I have here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced

                     <p>THe Second Evil I shall deal with, is the evil of
the Tongue, which, as St. <hi>Iames</hi> saith, is full
of deadly Poyson, Oathes, Curses, Blasphemies:
and this poyson it scatters up and down the
World in all places; an untamed member that
none can rule, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3. 7, 8. The fiercest of
beasts have been tamed by Man, (as the Apostle
there observes) which is a relique of his old supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority
and dominion over them; But this is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
Member that none can tame, but he that made
it: no beast so fierce and crabbed as this is. It may
be, I may be bitten by it for my labour and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to put a restraint upon it: but I shall adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it. My design is not to dishonour or exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
you: But if my faithfulness to God and you
should accidentally do so, I cannot help that.</p>
                     <p>Friends, Providence oftentimes confines many
of you together within the narrow limits of a
Ship, where you have time enough, and if your
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:32409:85"/>
hearts were sanctified, many choice advantages of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying
one another. O what transcendent sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
doth Providence daily present you with, to
take up your discourses! How many experiences of
extraordinary mercies and preservations have you
to relate to one another, and bless the Lord for!
Also, how many works of wonder do you daily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
who go down into the deeps? O what hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
imployment is here for your Tongues! How
should they be talking of all his wonders! How
should you call upon each other, as <hi>David</hi> did, Psal.
66. 16. <hi>Come hither, and I will tell you what God hath
done for my soul,</hi> at such a time, in such an extremity.
How should you call upon one another, to pay <hi>the
vows your lips have uttered in your distress?</hi> Thus should
one provoke another to this Angelical Work, as one
lively Bird sets the whole Flock a Chirping.</p>
                     <p>But tell me, Sirs, Should a Man come abaord
you at Sea, and ask of you, as Christ did of those
two Disciples going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> Luke 24. 17. <hi>VVhat
manner of communication is this that ye have hy the way?</hi>
O what a sad account would he have from most of
you! It may be he should find one <hi>Iesting,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Swearing,</hi> a third <hi>Reviling</hi> Godliness and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of it, so that it would be a little Hell for a
serious Christian to be confined to your Society. This
is not (I am confident) the manner of all. We have
a company of more sober Seamen, and blessed be God
for them; but surely thus stands the case with most
of you. Oh what stuff is here from persons profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Christianity, and bordering close upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of Eternity, as you do!</p>
                     <p>It is not my purpose to write of all the diseases of
the Tongue; that would fill a Volume, and is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with my intended brevity. Who can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the evils of the Tongue? The Apostle saith,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:32409:85"/>
                        <hi>It is a world of Iniquity,</hi> Jam. 3. 6. And if there be a
world of Sin in one member, Who can number the
Sins of all the members? <hi>Laurentius</hi> reckons as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sins of the Tongue, as there are Letters in the
<hi>Alphabet.</hi> And it is an observable Note that one
hath upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 13, 14. That when <hi>Paul</hi> anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizeth
the natural Man there, he insisteth longer
upon the Organs of Speech, than all the other
members. <hi>Their throat is an open sepulchre, with their
tongues they have used deceit, the poyson of Asps is under
their Lips, their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to be short, we find the Spirit of God in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
comparing the Tongue to a Tree, <hi>Prov. 15.
4. A wholesome Tongue is a Tree of Life.</hi> And words
is the fruit of the Tree, Isa. 57. 12. <hi>I create the
fruit of the Lips.</hi> Some of these Trees bear preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fruits, and it is a lovely sight to behold them
laden with them in their seasons, Prov. 25. 11. <hi>A
word fitly spoken, is like Apples of Gold in Pictures of
Silver.</hi> Such a Tongue is a Tree of Life. Others
of these Trees bear evil Fruit, Grapes of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and
Clusters of <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> I shall onely insist upon two
sorts of these fruits, <hi>viz.</hi> (1.) Withered sapless
fruit; I mean, idle and unprofitable words. (2.)
Rotten and corrupt fruit; I mean, prophane Oathes,
and prophanations of the sacred Name of God. No
fruit in the world so apt to corrupt and taint, as
the fruits of the Lips. When it is so, the Scripture
calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                        </gap>, corrupt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r rotten communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 29. To prevent this, the Spirit of
God prescribes an excellent way to season our words,
and keep them sweet and sound, that they may
neither wither nor become idle and sapless, nor pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie
and become rotten, as prophane words are,
Col. 4. 6. <hi>Let your speech be always with grace, season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with salt, that you may know how to answer every
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:32409:86"/>
man.</hi> Oh if the salt of Grace were once cast into
the fountain, the Heart, the streams must needs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more savory and pleasant, as the waters of
<hi>Marah</hi> when they were healed. My present work
is to attempt the cure of this double evil, of <hi>idle
words,</hi> and <hi>prophane Oathes,</hi> whereof thousands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you are deeply guilty. I shall begin with
the first, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. IDLE WORDS: that is, useless Chat,
unprofitable Talk, that is not referred any way to
the glory of God: This is a common evil, and little
regarded by most men, but yet a sin of severer
aggravations than the most imagine. Light words
weigh heavy in Gods ballance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. For first, the evil of them is exceedingly
aggravated by this: They abuse and prevert the
Tongue, that noble member, from that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and use which God by the law of Creation
designed it to. God gave not to man the Organs
and power of Speech (which is his excellency above
the Beasts) to serve a passion, or vain humour, to
vent the froth and vanity of his spirit: but to extol
his Creator, and render him the praise of all his
admirable and glorious works. For though the
Creation be a curious well tuned Instrument, yet
man is the Musician that must touch it and make the
melody; this was the end of God in forming those
Instruments and Organs: but now hereby they are
subject to Satan and Lust, and employed to the
dishonour of God that made them. God is pleased
to suspend the power of Speech (as we see in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren)
till Reason begin to bud in them; they have
not the liberty of the one, till they have the use of
the other: which plainly shews, that God is not
willing to have our words run waste.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:32409:86"/>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. It is a sinful wasting of our precious time,
and that puts a further aggravation upon it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
Sirs, the time of Life is but a little spot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
two eternities. The long-suffering God
wheels about those glorious Celestial Bodies over
your heads in a constant revolution, to beget time
for you; and the preciousness of every minute there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
results from its use and end: It is intended and
afforded as a space to you to repent in, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 21.
And therefore great things depend upon it: no less
than your eternal Happiness or Misery, hangs upon
those precious opportunities. Every minute of it
hath an influence into Eternity. How would the
damned value one hour of it, if they might enjoy it!
The business you have to do in it, is of unspeakable
weight and concernment; this great work, this
Soul-work, and Eternity-work lies upon your hands,
you are cast into streights of time about it. And
if so, Oh what an evil is it in you, to waste it away
thus to no purpose!</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. It's a sin that few are sensible of, as they
are of other sins, and therefore the more dangerous.
It's commonly committed, and that without checks
of Conscience. Other sins, as Murther and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,
though they be horrid sins, yet are but
seldom committed, and when they are, Conscience
is startled at the horridness of them: Few, except
they be prodigious wretches indeed, dare make light
of them. But now for idle and vain words, there
are inumerable swarms of these every day, and few
regard them. The intercourse betwixt the heart
and tongue is quick; they are quickly committed,
and as easily forgotten.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. And then 4thly, They have mischievous
effects upon others. How long doth an idle word
or foolish jest stick in mens minds, and become an
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32409:87"/>
occasion of much sin to them? The froath and
vanity of thy Spirit, which thy tongue so freely vents
among thy vain Companions, may be working in
their minds, when thou art in the dust, and so be
transmitted from one to another; for unto that no
more is requisite than an <hi>objective existence</hi> of those
vain words in their memories. And thus mayst
thou be sinning in the persons of thy Companions,
when thou art turned into dust. And this is one
reason that <hi>Suarez</hi> gives for a general Judgment,
after men have past their particular judgment, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after their death, <hi>Because</hi> (saith he) <hi>after
this, multitudes of sins by their means will be committed
in the world,, for which they must yet be judged to a fuller
measure of wrath.</hi> So that look as many of the
precious Servants of God now in glory, have left
many weighty and holy Sayings behind them, by
which many thousands of souls have been benefitted,
and God glorified on Earth, after they had left it<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
So thou leavest that vanity upon the mind of others
behind thee, by which he may be dishonoured to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
generations.</p>

the <hi>swiftness</hi> of it; it flyes towards the house of the
Swearer, it makes haste. The Judgments that are
written in it linger not, but are even in pain to be
delivered. And this flying Roll full of dreadful
Woes, flyes and enters into the house of the Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
<hi>and it shall therein remain,</hi> saith the Lord, it shall
cleave to his family; none shall claw off these woes
from him: And it shall consume the Timber thereof,
and the Stones thereof, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) bring utter subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ruine, and desolation to his House. O dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
sin! What a desolation doth it make! Your
Mouths are full of Oathes, and your Houses shall be
full of Curses. Wo to that wretched Family into
which this flying Roll shall enter; Wo, I say, to the
wretched Inhabitants thereof. <hi>The Curse of the Lord</hi>
(saith <hi>Solomon) is in the house of the wicked; but He
blesseth the [habitation] of the just,</hi> Prov. 3. 33. <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guriolum,</hi>

Ah, how many stately <hi>Mansious</hi> are there, in which
little other language but Oathes and Curses are
heard! and these are as so much Gunpowder laid
under the foundation of them, which when Justice
shall set fire to, Oh what work will it make! Wo
to the Inhabitants thereof. Well then, break off
this sin by Repentance, unless you intend to ruine
your Families, and bring all the Curses of God into
your Houses. If you have no pity for your selves, yet

unless God hath lost all his Authority with you, and
Hell all its Terrors, it should startle you. The first
is that dreadful Scripture, James 5. 12. <hi>But above

and earnestness, like that, Ephes. 6. 16.
<hi>But above all, taking the shield af Faith.</hi> As Faith
hath a prelation there before all the Graces, so Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here before all other Vices. [<hi>Swear not</hi>] (i. e.)
<hi>vainly, rashly, profanely;</hi> for otherwise 'tis a lawful
thing, and a part of Gods worship, as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
but swear not vain Oaths, by the Creatures,
Heaven, or Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is to advance the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
into the room of God. A sin to which the Jews
were much addicted. But, <hi>Let your yea, be yea! and
nay, nay? (i. e.</hi>) accustom your selves to short and
plain Affirmations and Negations, to a simple and
candid expression of your minds. And the thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Argument that backs it, is this; [<hi>lest ye fall into
Condemnation] (i. e.</hi>) lest for these things the Judge
of Heaven and Earth pass a Sentence of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Hell upon you. Oh Sirs Dare you touch with
this hot iron? Dare you from henceforward commit
that Sin, that you know will bring you under the
condemnation and judgment of God? Do you know
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:32409:90"/>
what it is for a soul to be cast at Gods bar? Did you
never see a poor malefacter tried at the Assizes, and
observe how his face gathers paleness, how his Legs
tremble, and Death displays its colours in his cheeks,
when sentence is given upon him? But what's that
to Gods condemnation? What is a Gallous to Hell?
Another Text I would commmend to your consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
is that Exod. 20. 7. <hi>The Lord will not hold him
guiltless that taketh his Name in vain.</hi> Where vain
Oathes are especially included. Now what doth
God mean, when He saith, He will not hold him
guiltless? The meaning is plain, his sins shall be
reckoned and imputed to him, they shall lie upon
his Soul; he shall be bound over to answer God for
them. O terrible sentence! What Soul can bear it,
or stand before it! <hi>Blessed is the man</hi> (saith <hi>David)
to whom the Lord imputeth not inquity.</hi> Surely then,
cursed is that man, to whom God will impute them.
And to the Swearer they shall all be imputed, if he
break not off his sin by repentance, and get a Christ the
sooner. O Soul! How dar'st thou think of going
before the Lord with the guilt of all thy sins upon
thee? When Christ would administer the very spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Joy in one sentence to a poor Sinner, Matth.
9. 4. He said, <hi>Son be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en.</hi>
And when God would contract the sum of all
misery into one word, He saith, <hi>His sins shall lie down
with him in the dust,</hi> Job 20. 11. Ah soul! One of
these days thou shalt be laid on thy Death-bed, or
see the waves that shall entomb thee leaping and
roaring upon every side; and then thou wilt surely
have other thoughts of the happiness that lies in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sin, than thou hast now. Observe the
most incorrigible Sinner then; hark how he sighs,
and groans, and cries; Ah Lord! and must I die?
And then see how the tears trickle down his Cheeks,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:32409:90"/>
and his heart ready to burst within him. Why,
what's the matter? Oh, the Lord will not pardon
him, he holds him guilty. If he were sure his sins
were forgiven, then he could die; but oh! to appear
before the Lord in them, appals him, daunts him,
kills the very heart of him. He would fain cry for
mercy, but Conscience stops his mouth. Oh, saith
Conscience, how canst thou move that tongue to God
in prayer for mercy, that hath so often rent and torn
his glorious Name, by Oaths and Curses? Sirs! I
pray you, do not make light of these things: they
will look wishly upon you one of these days, except ye
prevent it by sound conversation.</p>

37. 30. <hi>The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and
his tongue talketh of Iudgment; for the law of the Lord
is in his heart.</hi> To this sense we must understand
that Scripture, att. 12. 27. <hi>By thy words thou shalt
be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</hi>
Certainly, Justification and Condemnation, in the
day of Judgment, shall not pass upon us meerly
for the good or bad words we have spoken; but
according to the state of the Person, and frame of
the heart. But the meaning is, that our words
shall justifie or condemn us in that day, as evidence
of the state and frame of the Soul. We use to say,
such Witnesses hang'd a man; the meaning is, the
Evidence they gave cast and condemned him. O
think seriously of this; if words evidence the state
of the Soul, what an woful state must thy Soul
needs be in, whose mouth overflows with Oathes
and Curses! How many witnesses will be brought
in, to cast thee in the great Day? <hi>Your own tongue
shall then fall upon you,</hi> as the expression is, <hi>Psal.</hi>
64, 8. And out of your own mouth, God will fetch
abundant evidence to condemn you. And thus I
have opened unto you the evil of vain words, and
prophane Oathes; and presented to your view their
several aggravations. If by these things there be a
relenting pang upon thy heart, and a serious resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

and do fully understand the rule of Judgment; and the
whole process thereof, I say, and do assure you,
that [<hi>every idle word that men shall speak,] (i. e.</hi>)
every word that hath not a tendency and reference
to the Glory of God though there be no other obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
or evil in them than this, that they want a
good end. How much more then scurrilous Words,
bloody Oathes and Blasphemies! [<hi>Men shall give

to suffer the wrath of God for them; as appears
by that parallel Scripture, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 4, 5. For as
the Learned observe, there is plainly a <hi>Matalepsis</hi> in
these words; The <hi>Antecedent, to give an account,</hi> is put

sinner: by which term, the Scripture deciphers an
unclean person; as if among sinners there were none
of such a prodigious stature in sin as they. And we
find that when the spirit of God would set forth any
sin by an odious name, he calls it Adultery; so
Idolatry is called Adultery, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 32. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
this spiritual and corporal Adultery, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
are found in the same persons. They that
give themselves up to the one<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> are by a righteous
hand of God given up to the other, as it is too
manifestly and frequently exemplified in the World.
So earthly-mindedness hath this name put upon it,
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> purpose to affright men from it, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 4.
Now certainly, God would never borrow the name
of this sin to set out the evil of other sins, if it were
not most vile and abominable. It's call'd the sin of
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or heathen, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 5. And oh that
we could say, it were only among them that know
not God! Now then, are you able to look these
Scriptures in the face, and not blush? Oh what a
sin is this! Art thou willing to be ranked with <hi>Fools,
Dogs, Sinners, Heathens,</hi> and take thy lot with them?
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:32409:94"/>
God hath planted that affection of shame in thy
nature, to be as a guard against such filthy lusts; it's
a sin that hath filthiness enough in it, to defile the
tongue that mentions it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. It is a sin that the God of Heaven hath
often prohibited, and severely condemned in the
Word, which abundantly declares his abhorrence of
it. You have prohibition upon prohibition, and
threatning upon threatning in the Word against it.
Exod. 20. 14. <hi>Thou shalt not commit adultery.</hi> This
was delivered upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> with the greatest
solemnity and terrour, by the mouth of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Turn to, and ponder the following Scriptures,
among many others, <hi>Prov. 5. 2, 3, 4. Acts 5. 29.
Rom. 1. 24, 29. Rom. 13. 13. 1 Cor. 6. 13, 14, 15,
16, 18. 2 Cor. 12. 21. Gal. 5. 29. Ephes. 5. 3. Col.
3. 5. 1 Thes. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

All these, with many others, are the true sayings of
God; By them thou shalt be tryed in the last day.
Now consider how terrible it will be<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> to have so
many words of God, and such terrible ones too, as
most of those are, to be brought in and pleaded
against thy Soul in that day: mountains and hills
may depart, but these words shall not depart;
He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ven and Earth shall pass away, but not one tittle
of the Word shall pass away. Believe it, Sinner,
as sure as the Heavens are over thy head, and the
Earth under thy seet, they shall one day take hold
of thee, though we poor worms who plead them
with thee, die and perish, Zech. 1. 5, 6. <hi>The Lord
tells us it shall not fall to the ground.</hi> Which is a
borrowed speech from a Dart that is flung with a
weak hand; it goes not home to the mark, but falls
to the ground by the way. None of these words
shall so fall to the ground.</p>

                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. It is a sin that defiles and destroys the
body, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 18. He that committeth adultery,
sinneth against his own body.</hi> In most other sins the
body is but the <hi>Instrument,</hi> here it is the <hi>Object</hi> against
which the sin is committed; that body of thine,
which should be the Temple of the holy Ghost, is
turned into a stye of filthiness; yea, it not only
<hi>defiles,</hi> but destroys it. <hi>Iob</hi> calls it a <hi>fire that burneth
to destruction, Iob</hi> 31. 12. or as the <hi>Septuagint</hi> reads
it, a fire that burneth in all the Members. It is a
sin that God hath plagued with strange and terrible
diseases; that <hi>Morbus Gallicus,</hi> and <hi>sudor Anglicus,</hi>
and that <hi>Plica Polonica</hi> whereof you may read in
<hi>Bolton</hi>'s four last things, page 30. and <hi>Sclater</hi> on
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 30. These were judgments sent immediately
by Gods own hand, to correct the new sins and
enormities of the world; for they seem to put the
best Physicians besides their Books. Oh how terrible
is it to lie groaning under the sad effects of this
sin? As <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, Prov. 5. 11. <hi>And thou
mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed.</hi>
To this sense some expound that terrible
Text, Heb. 13. 4. <hi>Marriage is honourable in all, and
the bed undefiled; but Whoremongers and Adulterers
God will judge: (i. e.</hi>) with some remarkable judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
inflicted on them in this world: if it escape
the punishment of men, it shall not escape the
vengeance of God. Ah! with what comfort may
a man lie down upon a sick bed, when the sickness
can be looked upon as a Fatherly Visitation coming
in Mercy? But thou that shortenest thy life, and
bringest sickness on thy self by such a sin, art the
Devils Martyr; and to whom canst thou turn in
such a day for comfort?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Consider what an indelible blot it is to
thy nature, which can never be wiped away: though
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:32409:95"/>
thou escape with thy life, yet as one says, thou shalt
be burnt in the hand, yea, branded in the forehead.
What a foul scar is that upon the face of <hi>David</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
which abides to this day? <hi>He was upright in all
things, save in the matter of</hi> Uriah. And how was
he slighted by his own Children and servants after
he had committed this sin? Compare 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30.
with 2 <hi>Sam. 12. 10, 11. A wound and dishonour shall
he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away. This
is to give thine honour to another,</hi> Prov. 5. 9. The
shame and reproach attending it, should be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servative
from it. Indeed the Devil tempts to it by
hopes of secresie and concealment; but though many
other sins lie hid, and possibly shall never come to
light, until that day of manifestation of all hidden
things, yet this is a sin that is most usually discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Under the Law, Cod appointed an extraordinary
way for the discovery of it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 13. And to
this day the Providence of God doth often very
strangely bring it to light, though it be a deed of
darkness. The Lord hath many times brought such
persons either by terrors of Conscience, Phrensie, or
some other means, to be the publishers and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimers
of their own shame. Yea, observe this,
saith Reverend Mr. <hi>Hildersham</hi> on the Fourth of
<hi>Iohn,</hi> even those that are most cunning to conceal
and hide it from the eyes of the world, yet through
the just judgment of God, every one suspects and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
them for it, this dashes in pieces, at one
stroke, that Vessel in which the precious Oyntment
of a good name is carried. A fool in <hi>Israel</hi> shall be
thy title; and even Children shall point at thee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. It scatters thy substance, und roots up the
foundation of thy state. <hi>Iob 31. 12. It roots up all
the increase. Strangers shall be filled with thy wealth,
and thy labours shall be in the house of a stranger.</hi> Prov.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:32409:95"/>
5. 10. <hi>For by means of a whorish woman, a man is
brought to a morsel of bread.</hi> Prov. 6. 26. It gives
rags for its Livery (saith one:) and though it be
<hi>furthered</hi> by the fulness, yet it's <hi>followed</hi> with a morsel
of bread. This is one of those temporal Judgments
with which God punishes the unclean person in this
life. The word <hi>Delilah,</hi> which is the name of an
Harlot, is conceived to come from a root that
signifies<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>to exhaust, drain, or draw dry. This sin
will quickly exhaust the fullest estate; and oh what
a dreadful thing will this be, when God shall require
an account of thy Stewardship in the great day! How
righteous is it, that that man should be fuel to the
wrath of God, whose health and wealth have been
so much fuel to maintain the flame of Lust! Oh how
lavish of their estates are sinners to satisfie their
Lusts! If the Members of Christ be sick, or in Prison,
they may there perish and starve, before they will
relieve them; but to obtain their Lusts, Oh how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive!
<hi>Ask me never so much and I will give it,</hi> said

<hi>Herodias.</hi> Well, you are liberal in spending trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
upon you lusts; and believe it, God will spend
treasures of wrath to punish you for your Lusts. It
had been a thousand times better for thee, thou hadst
never had an estate, that thou hadst begg'd thy
bread from door to door, than to have such a sad
reckoning as thou shalt shortly have for it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. Oh stand off from this sin, because it is a
pit out of which very few have been recovered that
have fallen therein. Few are the footsteps of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turners
from this den. The longer a man lives in
it, the less power he hath to leave it. It is not only
a <hi>damning,</hi> but an <hi>infatuating</hi> sin. The danger of
falling this way must needs be great, and the fall
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:32409:96"/>
very desperate, because few that fall into it do ever
rise again. I shall lay two very terrible Scriptures
before you to this purpose, either of them enough
to drive thee speedily to Christ, or to drive thee out
of thy wits: the one is that, Eccles. 7. 26. <hi>And I
find more bitter than death, the woman whose heart is
snares and nets, and whose hands are bands: Whoso plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be
taken by her.</hi> The Argument which the spirit of
God uses here to disswade from this Sin, is taken
from the <hi>subject;</hi> they that fall into it, for the most
part, are persons in whom God has no delight, and
so in judgment are delivered up to it, and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
by Grace from it. The other is that in
<hi>Prov. 22. 14. The mouth of a strange woman is a deep
pit; he that is abhorred of the Lord shall fall therein.</hi>
Oh terrible word! able to daunt the heart of the
the securest sinner; your whores <hi>embrace</hi> you, yea,
but God <hi>abhors</hi> you; you have their <hi>love,</hi> oh but you
are under Gods <hi>hatred!</hi> What say you to these two
Scriptures? If you are not Athiests, methinks such
a word from the mouth of God, should strike like a
Dart through thy Soul. And upon this account it
is that they never are recover'd, because God has no
delight in them. If this be not enough, view one
Scripture more, Prov. 2. 18, 19. <hi>For her house in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth
unto Death, and her paths unto the Dead: None
that go to her reture again, neither take they hold of the
paths of life.</hi> Reader, if thou be a person addicted
to this sin, go thy ways, and think seriously what a
case thou art in. <hi>None return again (i. e.</hi>) a very
few of many: the examples of such as have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
are very rare. <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us, the <hi>Mermaids</hi>
are commonly seen in green Meadows, and have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting
Voices; but there are always found heaps
of dead mens bones lying by them. This may be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:32409:96"/>
but a fabulous Story: But I am sure it is true of the
Harlot, whose Syren-Songs have allured thousands to
their inevitable destruction. It's a captivating sin,
that leads away the sinner in triumph; they cannot
deliver their souls: Prov. 7. 22. <hi>He goeth after her
straightway, as an Ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a
[Fool] to the correction of the stocks.</hi> Mark; a Fool:
it dementates and befools men, takes away their
understanding: the <hi>Septuagint</hi> renders it, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>,
As a dog to the Collar, or, like as we use
to say, a dog in a string. I have read of one, that
having by this sin wasted his body, was told by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians,
that except he left it, he would quickly lose
his Eyes; he answered, If it be so, then <hi>Vale lumen
amicum,</hi> Farewel sweet light. And I remember
<hi>Luther</hi> writes of a certain Nobleman in his Country,
who was so besotted with the sin of Whoredome,
that he was not ashamed to say, That if he might
live here for ever, and be carried from one stews to
another, he would never desire any other Heaven.
The greatest Conquerors that have subdued King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and scorned to be commanded by any, have
been miserably enslaved and captivated by this Lust.
O think sadly upon this argument; God often gives
them up to Impenitency, and will not spend a rod
upon them to reclaim them. See <hi>Hos. 4. 14. Revel.</hi>
22. 11.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. And then in the <hi>7th</hi> place, Those few
that have been recovered by Repentance out of it,
oh how bitter hath God made it to their souls! <hi>I
find it</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) more bitter than death,</hi> Eccles.
7. 26. Death is a very bitter thing; Oh what a
struggling and reluctance is there in Nature against
it? But this is more bitter. Poor <hi>David</hi> found it
so, when he roared under those bloody lashes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
for it, in <hi>Psalm</hi> 51. Ah! when the Lord
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:32409:97"/>
shall open the poor Sinner's eyes, to see the horrid
guilt he hath hereby contracted upon his own poor
soul, it will haunt him as a Ghost, day and night, and
terrifie his soul with dreadful forms and representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
O dear-bought pleasure, if this were all it
should cost. What is now become of the pleasure of
sin? Oh! what gall and wormwood wilt thou taste,
when once the Lord shall bring thee to a sight of it,
the Hebrew word for Repentance [<hi>Nacham</hi>] and
the Greek word [<hi>Metamelia</hi>] the one signifies an
<hi>irking of the Soul,</hi> and the other signifies <hi>After grief.</hi>
Yea, it is called <hi>A renting of the heart,</hi> as if it were
torn in pieces in a mans breast. Ask such a poor
soul, what it thinks of such Courses now? Oh now
it loaths, abhors it self for them. Ask him, if he
dare sin in that kind again? You may as well ask me
(will he answer) whether I will thrust my hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the fire. Oh it breeds an <hi>indignation</hi> in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
himself. That word [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                        </gap>] 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.
11. signifies the rising of the stomach with very rage,
and being sick with anger. Religious wrath is the
fiercest wrath. Oh what a furnace is the breast of
the poor penitent! what fumes, what heats do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in it, whilst the sin is even before him, and
the sense of guilt upon him? One night of carnal
pleasure will keep thee many days and nights upon
the rack of horrour, if ever God give thee repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
unto life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 8. And if thou never repent, as indeed but

                        </gap>ew do that fall into this sin, then consider how God
will follow thee with eternal vengeance. Thou shalt
have flaming Fire for burning Lust. This is a sin
that hath a scent of fire and brimstone with it,
wherever you meet with it in Scripture. The
Harlots guests are lodged in the <hi>depths of Hell,</hi> Prov.
9. 18. No more perfumed beds; they must now
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:32409:97"/>
lie down in flames. Whoremongers shall have their
part in the Lake that burneth with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone;
which is the second death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 1. Such
shall not inherit the Kingdom of God and Christ,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9. No Dog shall come into the new <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem;</hi>
there shall in no wise enter in any thing that
defileth, or that worketh abomination. You have
spent your strength upon sin, and now God sets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a work to shew the glory of his Power in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22. The wrath of God is transacted
upon them in Hell by his own immediate hand, <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

10. 30. Because no Creature is strong enough to
convey all his wrath, and it must all be poured out
upon them, therefore he himself will torment them
for ever with his own immediate Power; now he
will <hi>stir up all his wrath,</hi> and sinners shall know the
price of their pleasures. The punishment of <hi>Sodom,</hi>
is a little Map of Hell, as I may say. Oh how ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
a day was that upon those unclean wretches!
but that fire was not of many days continuance;
when it had consumed them, and their houses, it
went out for want of matter: but here, the breath
of the Lord like a stream of brimstone, kindles it.
The pleasure was quickly gone, but the sting and
torment abide for ever. <hi>Who knoweth the power of his
anger? Even according to his fear, so is his wrath,</hi>
Psal. 90. 11. Oh consider, how will his Almighty
Power rack and torment thee! Think on this, when
sin comes with a smiling face towards thee in the
temptation. Oh think! If the humane nature of
Christ recoyled, when his cup of Wrath was given
him to drink; if he were fore amazed at it, how
shalt thou a poor worm, bear and grapple with it
for ever?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 9. Consider further, how closely soever thou
carriest thy wickedness in this world, tho it should
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:32409:98"/>
never be discovered here, yet there is a day coming
when all will out, and that before Angels and men.
God will rip up thy secret sins, in the face of that
great Congregation at the day of judgment: then
that which was done in secret shall be proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as upon the house-top, <hi>Luke 12. 3. Then God
will judge the [secrets] of men,</hi> Rom. 2. 16.
<hi>the hidden things of darkness will be brought into the
open light.</hi> Sinner, there will be no sculking for thee
in the Grave, no declining this Bar; thou refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedst
indeed to come to the <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> when
God invited thee, but there will be no refusing to
appear before <hi>the Bar of Iustice,</hi> when Christ shall
summon thee. And as thou canst not decline ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
so neither canst thou then palliate and
hide thy wickedness any longer: for then shall the
<hi>Books</hi> be opened; the Book of God's Omniscience,
and the Book of thine own Conscience, wherein all
thy secret Villany is recorded; for though it cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to speak to thee, yet it ceased not to write and
record thy actions. If thy shameful sins should be
divulged now, it would make thee tear off thy hair
in indignation; but then all will be discovered. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
and men shall point at thee, and say, Lo, this
is the Man, this is he that carried it so smoothly in
in the world. Mr. <hi>Thomas Fuller</hi> relates a story of
<hi>Ottocar</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia, who refusing to do his homage
to</hi> Rodolphus <hi>the first, Emperour, being at last sorely
chastised with war, condescended to do him homage pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
in a Tent: but the Tent was so contrived by the
Emperours Servants,</hi> (saith the Historian) <hi>that by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one cord it was all taken away, and so</hi> Ottocar <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
on his knees, doing Homage to the Emperour, in
the view of three Armies.</hi> O Sirs, you think to carry
it closely, you wait for the Twilight: that none may
see you; but alas! it will be to no end, this day will
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:32409:98"/>
discover it; and then what confusion and everlasting
shame will cover thee! Will not this work
then?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arg.</hi> 10. Lastly, consider but one thing more,
and I have done. By this sin thou dost not only damn
thine own soul but, drawest another to hell with thee.
This sin is not as a single bullet that kills but one,
but as a chain-shot, it kills many, two at least, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
God give repentance. And if he should give
thee repentance, yet the other party may never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and so perish for ever through thy wickedness;
and oh, what a sad consideration will that be to thee,
that such a poor soul is in Hell, or likely to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by thy means! Thou hast made fast a snare up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Soul which now thou canst not untie; thou hast
done that which may be matter of sorrow to thee as
long as thou livest; but though thou canst grieve
for it, thou canst not remedy it. In other sins it is
not so; If thou hadst stoll'n anothers Goods, resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
might be made to the injured party, but here
can be none. If thou hadst murthered another, thy
sin was thine own, not his that was murthered by
thee; but this is a complicated sin, defiling both at
once; and if neither repent, then oh what a sad
greeting will these poor wretches have in hell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

God, if thou hast defiled thy Soul by this abominable
sin, speedily to repent. Oh get the blood of sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

God often gives up men to these vile affections,

a little with your Conscience concerning the
precious mercies you have received, and the solemn
promises you have bound your selves withal for the

bankrupt debtors among you, that have dealt slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perily
and unfaithfully with him, that have not

he hath done for them, nor according to those good
things they have vowed to the Mighty God of

and God is breaking all. He cannot have what he
would have, what he should have; he will take what he
can get: for money, he will take goods, limbs, arms,

                     <p>Do you hear, Souls? Is not this sad news to some
of you, who have received vast sums of mercy, and
given God your bond for the repayment of him in
praise and answerable fruit, and yet forfeited all,
and lost your credit with God? Oh how can you
look God in the face, with whom you have dealt so
perfidiously? I am now come in the Name of God
to demand his due of you; to call to remembrance
the former receipts of mercy which you mind not,
but God doth, and there is a witness in your bosome

you never had experience of the power and
goodness of God, in restoring you to Health from
dangerous Sickness and Diseases? Have you not
sometimes had the sentence of Death in your selves?
and that possibly when you have been in remote parts
far from your Friends and Relations, and destitute of
all means and accommodations. Did you not say
in that condition, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did in a like case? <hi>Isai.
38. 10, 11, 12. I said in the cutting off of my days, I
shall go to the gates of the grave, I am deprived of the

thy self, man, canst not thou call to mind

by thee, and it may be hit those next thee; took away
those that were as lively and as lusty as thy self,
when you began your Voyage, and yet they were
cast for death, thou for life, and that when there
was but an hairs breadth betwixt thee and the grave?
Tell me, Soul, What friend was that stood by thee
then, when thou wast forsaken of all friends? When
it may be thy Companions stood ready to throw thee
over-board, Who was it that pitied and remembred
thee in thy low estate? Who was it that rebuked

brought low and weak, and like a crazy rotten Ship
in a storm, took in water on all sides, so that all the
Physitians in the World could not have stopt those
Leaks; consider, what hand was that which quieted
and calmed the tempestuous Sea, <hi>careened</hi> and mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thy crazy Body, and launched thee into the World
again, as whole, as sound, as strong as ever? Was it
not the Lord, that hath done all this for thee? Did
not he keep back thy Soul from the Pit, and thy
Life from perishing? Yea, when thou wast cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened
with pain upon thy Bed (as <hi>Elihu</hi> speaks)
<hi>Iob</hi> 33. 19, 20, 21. and the multitude of thy bones
with strong pains, so that thy life abhorred bread,
and thy Soul dainty meat; thy flesh consumed away
that it could not be seen, and thy bones that were
not seen stuck out: yet then, as it is, <hi>vers.</hi> 28. he
delivered thy Soul from going down into the Pit,
and caused thy Life to see the Light. Had the Lamp
of life been then extinguisht, thou hadst gone into
endless Darkness; Hell had shut her mouth upon
thee. Now tell me, Soul, What hast thou done
with this precious mercy? Hast thou walked before
the Lord in a deep sense thereof, and answered his
end therein, which was, to lead thee to Repentance?
Or hath thy stupid or disingenious heart forgotten
it, and lost all sense of it, so that God's end is fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
and thy Salvation not a jot furthered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by?
O<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> If it be so, wo to thee; for the blood of
this Mercy, which thy Ingratitude hath murther'd,
like the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> cries to God against thee.
What a Wretch art thou thus to requite the Lord
for such a Mercy! He saw thy Tears, and heard thy
groans, and said within himself, He shall not die, but
live; Alas, poor Creature, if I cut him off now,
he is eternally lost: I will send him back a few
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:32409:102"/>
years more into the World; I will try him once
more, it may be he will bear some fruits to me
from this deliverance; and if so, well; if not, I will
cut him down hereafter: He shall be set at liberty
upon his Good Behaviour a little longer. And is
all this nothing in thine eyes? Wretch that thou
art, Dost thou forget and flight such a favour as
this? Is it worth no more in thine eyes? Well, it
would be worth something in the eyes of the poor
Damned Souls, if they might have so many years
cut out of their Eternity, for a meer intermission of
their Torments, much more as a time of patience
and mercy. O consider, what pity and goodness
thou hast abused.</p>

streights and extremities, wherein the good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God relieved and supplied thee? How
many of you have been beaten so long at Sea, by
reason of contrary winds, and other accidents, till
your Provisions have been even exhausted and spent?
To how short allowance have you been kept? And
what a mercy would you have esteemed it, if you
could but have satisfied Nature with a full draught
of Water? Certainly, this hath been the case of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of you. Oh what a price and vallue did you
then set upon those common Mercies, which at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
times have been slightly over-look'd! and
when you have seen no hopes of relief, Have you
not looked sadly one upon another? and it may be
said as that Widow of <hi>Zarephtah</hi> did to the Prophet,
1 King. 17. 12. <hi>And she said, As the Lord thy God
liveth, I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in a
barrel, and a little oyl in a cruse: aud behold, I am ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
two sticks that I may go in and dress it for
me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.</hi> Even
such hath been your case; yet hath that God, whose
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:32409:103"/>
Mercies are over all his Works, heard your sorrows,
and provided Relief for you<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> either by some Ship,
which Providence sent to relieve you in that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress;
or by altering the Winds, and sending you
safe to the Land, before all your Provisions have
been spent. And hast thou kept no Records of
these gracious Providences? yea, Dost thou abuse
the Creature, when thou art brought again to the
full enjoyment of it? and possibly receivest the
Creatures (whose worth thou so lately hast seen
in the want of them) without thanksgiving, or a
sensible acknowledgment of the goodness of God in
them? I say, dost thou thus answer the expectations
of God? Well, beware lest God teach such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Creature, by woful experience, that the
opening of his hand to give thee a Mercy, is worth
the opening thy Lips to bless him for it. Beware
lest that unthankful Mouth, that will not bless the
Lord for Bread and Water, have neither the one or
the other to bless him for. I can give you a sad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in the case, and I have found it in the Writing
of an eminent Divine, who saith he had it from an
eye and ear-witness of the truth of it. A young
Man lying upon his Sick-bed, was always calling for
meat, but when the meat he called for was brought
unto him, he shook and trembled dreadfully at the
sight of it, and that in every part of his body; and
so continued, until his food was carried away. And
thus he did, as often as any food was brought into
his presence; and not being able to eat one bit,
pined away: but before his death, he freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the Justice of God in this punishment; For,
said he, in the time of my Health, I ordinarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
my meat without thanksgiving. O! Let the
abusers and despisers of such Mercies, fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

and saved by the Lord, in the greatest dangers and
hazards of life; in fights at Sea, when men have
dropt down at your right hand and at your left, and
yet the Lord hath cover'd your heads in the day of
battle? And though you have been equally obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious
to Death and Danger with others, yet your
name was not found among theirs in the list of the
dead? Or in Shipwracks, ah, how narrowly have
some of you escaped! A plank hath been cast in,
you know not how, to save you, when your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
for want of it, have gone down to the
bottome; or you have been enabled to swim to the
Shore, when others have fainted in the way, and
perished. In what a variety of strange and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Providences hath God walked towards some of
you, and what returns have you made to God for it?

a sin that goes neer to the heart of God. O! he
cannot bear it. It is not the giving out of mercy
that troubles him, for that he doth with delight; but
the recoyling of his mercies upon him by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
ingratitude, this wounds. <hi>Be astonished, O ye
heavens, at this, and be ye horribly afraid.</hi> And again,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:32409:104"/>
                        <hi>Hear O heavens, and give ear O earth,</hi> Isa. 1. 2. <hi>q. d.</hi>
O you innocent Creatures which inviolably observe
the law of your Creation, be you all astonished and
cloathed in black, to see Nature cast by sin so far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it self; and that in a Creature so much superiour
to you as Man, who in the very womb, was crown'd
a King, and admitted into the highest Order of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and set as Lord and Master over you; yet
doth he act not onely below himself, but below the
very beasts. <hi>The Ox knoweth his owner, (i. e.)</hi> There
is a kind of gratitude in the beasts, by which they
acknowledge their benefactors that feed and preserve
them. Oh! What a pathetical exclamation is that,
<hi>Deut. 32. 6. Do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

God, and will make it burn dreadfully against thee
unthankful sinner; it stirs up the anger of God, in
whomsoever it be found, though in the person of a
Saint, 2 <hi>Chron. 32. 25. But Hezekiah rendered not
again according to the benefit done unto him: for his
heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him,
and upon Ierusalem.</hi> And so you read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. That
the Heathen, because they were not thankful, were
given up to vile affections; the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

world. It is a sin that the God of Mercy scarce
knows how to pardon, <hi>Ier. 5. 7. How shall I pardon
thee for this?</hi> This forgetting of the God that saves
us in our extremities, is a sin that brings desolation
and ruine, the effects of God's high displeasure, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all our temporal enjoyments. See that remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Scripture, Isa. 17. 10, 11. <hi>Because thou hast
[forgotten] the God of [thy salvation] and hast
not been [mindful] of the rock of [thy strength<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>]
Therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it
with strange slips; in the day shalt thou make thy plant
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:32409:104"/>
to grow, and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to
flourish, but the Harvest shall be an heap in the day of
grief and desperate sorrow.</hi> The meaning is, that God
will blast and curse all thine employments, and thou
shalt be under desperate sorrow, by reason of the
disappointments of thy hopes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Consid.</hi> 4. It's a sin that cuts off Mercy from you in
future straits: if you thus requite the Lord for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
mercies, never expect the like in future distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
God is not weary of his blessings, to cast them
away upon such Souls that are but graves to them.
Mark what a reply God made to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> when
they cryed unto him for help, being invaded by the
<hi>Amorites,</hi> Judg. 10. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Did not I deliver
you from the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>and from the</hi> Amorites, <hi>from the Children of</hi> Ammon, <hi>and from the</hi> Philistines? <hi>The</hi>
Zidonians <hi>also, and the</hi> Amalekites, <hi>and ye cryed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, and I delivered you out of their hands; yet ye
have forsaken me, and served other Gods; wherefore I
will deliver you no more.</hi> O sad word! It is (as if
the Lord had said) I have tryed what mercy and
deliverance will do with you, and I see you are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the better for it; deliverance is but seed sown
upon the Rocks: I will cast away no more favours
upon you; now look to your selves, shift for your
selves for time to come, wade through your troubles
as well as you can. O brethren, there is nothing
more quickly works the ruine of a People, than the
abuse of mercy. O methinks this Text should strike
terrour into your hearts. How often hath God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
you? Remember thy eminent deliverance at
such a time, in such a Country, out of such a deep
distress: God was gracious to thy cry then; thou
hast forgotten and abused this mercy; what now, if
God should say, as in the Text<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Therefore I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
thee no more. Ah poor Soul! What would'st
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:32409:105"/>
thou do then, or to whom wilt thou turn? It may
be thou wilt cry to the Creatures for help and pity;
but alas, to what purpose? they will give as cold and
as comfortless an answer, as <hi>Samuel</hi> gave unto <hi>Saul,</hi>
1 Sam. 28. 15, 16. <hi>And Samuel said to Saul, VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hast <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>hou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul
answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make
war against me, and God is departed from me, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth
me no more, neither by Prophets, nor by Dreams;
therefore have I called thee</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then said Samuel,
Wherefore then doest thou ask of me, seeing the Lord is
departed from thee, and become thine enemy?</hi> O!
thou wilt be a poor shiftless creature, if once by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing
mercy thou make it thy Enemy.</p>
                     <p>Secondly. For the breach of Vows made in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
to obtain these mercies, and easily forgotten
and violated by thee when thou hast obtained thy
desire: A word or two to convince you what a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
evil lies in this, and how by this consideration
thy sins come to be boyed up to a greater height,
and aggravation of finfulness; and then I have done
with this Head.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A Vow, is a promise made to God, in the things of
God.</hi> The Obligation of it is by Casuists judged
to be as great as that of an Oath. It is a sacred and
solemn bond, wherein a Soul binds it self to God in
lawful things: and being once bound by it, it is a
most heinous evil to violate it. It is an high piece
of dishonesty to fail in what we have
promised to men,<note place="margin">Case of Consc.</note> saith Dr. <hi>Hall;</hi> but
to disappoint God in our Vows, is no
less than Sacriledge. The act is free
and voluntary; but if once a just and lawful vow
or promise hath past your lips (saith he) you may
not be false to God in keeping it. It is with us for
our vows, as it was with <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphirah,</hi> for
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:32409:105"/>
their substance: <hi>VVhilst it remained</hi> (saith <hi>Peter</hi>)
<hi>was it not thine own?</hi> He needed not to sell and give
it; but if he will give, he may not reserve; it is
death to save some: he lies to the Holy Ghost, that
defalks from that which he engaged himself to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow.
If thou have vowed to the mighty God of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
look to it that thou be faithful in thy perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
for he is a great and jealous God, and will
not be mocked.</p>
                     <p>Now I am confident, there be many among you,
that in your former distresses have solemnly engaged
your Souls thus to God; that if he would deliver
you out of those dangers, and spare your lives, you
would walk more strictly, and live more holy lives
than ever you did. You have, it may be, engaged
your Souls to the Lord against those sins, as Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness,
Lying, Swearing, Uncleanness, or whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
evil it was that your Conscience then smote you
for: the vows of God (I say) are upon many of
you. But have you performed those vows that your
lips have uttered? Have you dealt truly with God?
or have you mocked him, and lyed unto him with
your lips, and omitted those very duties you promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to perform, and return'd to the self-same evils
you promised to forsake. I only put the question,
let your Consciences answer it. But if it be so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that thou art a person that makest light of
thy engagements to God, as indeed Seamens Vows,
and Sick mens Promises are, for the most part, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
and slippery things, being extorted from
them by fear of Death, and not from any deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment
of the necessity and weight of those Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to which they bind their Souls: I say, if this
sin lie upon any of your Souls, I advise you to go
to God speedily, and bewail it; humble your self
greatly before him, admire his patience in forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:32409:106"/>
you, and pay unto him what your lips have
promised. And to move you thereunto, let these
Considerations, among many other, be laid to
heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Consid.</hi> 1. Think seriously upon the greatness of
that Majesty whom thou hast wronged, by lying to
him, and falsifying thy engagements. Oh think
sadly on this: It is not man whom thou hast abused,
but God; even that God in whose hand thy life and
breath is. For although (as one truly observes)
there be not in every vow a formal invocation of
God, (God being the proper Correlate, and as it
were a party to every vow, and therefore not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
to be invoked for the contestatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap> of it) yet
there is in every vow an implicite calling God to
witness; so that certainly the Obligation of a Vow
is not one jot beneath that of an Oath. Now if
God be as a party to whom thou hast past thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and its obligation on that ground be so great,
oh what hast thou done? for a poor worm to mock
with the most glorious majesty of Heaven, and break
Faith with God, what a dreadful thing is that? If
it were but to thy fellow-creature, though the sin
would be great yet not like unto this. Let me say
to thee, as the Prophet <hi>Isai. 7. 13. It is a small
thing for you to weary men, but you will weary my God
also?</hi> If you dare to deceive and abuse men, dare
you do so by God also? Oh if the exceeding villanies
of the sin do not affect thee, yet methinks the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of provoking so dreadful a Majesty against thee
should. And therefore consider,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Consid.</hi> 2. Secondly, That the Lord will most
certainly be avenged upon thee for these things, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
thou repent. O read and tremble at the word
of God, <hi>Eccles. 5. 4. When thou vowest a vow unto
God, defer not to pay it: for he hath no pleasure in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:32409:106"/>
fools; pay that which thou hast vowed. But better it is that
thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not
not pay. Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they
say thou before the Angel, that it was an errour; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
[should God be angry] at thy vice, and [destroy] the
works of thy hands?</hi> Mark, God will be angry, and in that
anger he will destroy the Work of thy hand, <hi>(i. e.)</hi>
saith <hi>Diodate, Bring thee and all thy actions to nought, by
reason af thy perjury.</hi> Now the anger of God, which thy
breach of promise kindles, as appears by this Text, is a
dreadful fire. Oh what Creature can stand before it! as
<hi>Asaph</hi> speaks, <hi>Psal. 76. 7. Thou, even thou art to be feared:
and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Consid.</hi> 3. Consider, thirdly, that all this while thou
sinnest against knowledge and Conviction: for did not
thy Conscience plainly convince thee, when imminent
danger open'd its mouth, that the matter of thy neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
vow was a most necessary duty; If not, why
didst thou bind thy Soul to forsake such practises, and
to perform such duties? Thou didst so look upon them
then; by which it appears, thy Conscience is convinced
of thy duty, but Lust masters and over-rules: And it
so, poor sinner, what a case art thou in, to go on from
day to day sinning against Light and Knowledge? Is
not this a fearful rate of sinning? And will not such sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
be plunged deeper into Hell than the poor <hi>Indians</hi>
that never saw the evil of their ways, as thou doest<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
Ponder but two or three Scriptures in thy thoughts, and
see what a dreadful way of sinning this is: <hi>Rom. 2. 9.
'Tribtlation, anguish and wrath to every Soul of man that
doth evil, to the [Iew first] and also to the Gentile.</hi> To the
Jew first (<hi>i. e.</hi>) to the Jew especially and principally; he
had a precedency in means and light, and so let him have
in punishment. So <hi>Iam. 4. 17. To him thrt knoweth to do
good, and doth it not, to him it is sin (i. e.)</hi> Sin with a
witness, horrid sin, sin that surpasses the deeds of the
wicked. So <hi>Luke 12. 47. And that servant that knew his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:32409:107"/>
Lords will, and prepared not himself, neither did according
to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.</hi> Which is a
plain allusion to the Custom of the <hi>Iews</hi> in punishing an
offender who being convicted, the Judge was to see him
bound fast to a Pillar, his cloaths stript off, and an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner
with a Scourge to beat him with so many
stripes: But now those stripes came but from the arm
of a Creature; these that the Text speaks of, are set on
by the omnipotent arm of God. Of the former there
was a determinate number set down in their law, as forty
stripes, and sometimes they would remit one of that
number too, in mercy to the offender, as you see in the
example of <hi>Paul, 2 Cor. 11. 24. Of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>ews I received
forty stripes save one;</hi> but in Hell no mitigation at all,
nor allay of mercy. The arm of his power supports the
Creature in its being, while the arm of his justice lays
on eternally. Soul, consider these things; do thou not
persist any longer then in such a desperate way of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
against the clear conviction of thine own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
which in this case must needs give testimony
against thee.</p>
                     <p>Well then; go to God with the words of <hi>David. Psal.</hi>
66. 13, 14. and say unto him, <hi>I will pay thee my vows
which my lips have uttered, and my tongue hath spoken when
I was in trouble.</hi> Pay it, Soul, and pay it speedily unto
God, else he will recover it by Justice, and fetch it out
of thy bones in Hell. O trifle not any longer with
God, and that in such serious matters as these are.</p>
                     <p>And now I have done my endeavour to give your
former Mercies and Promises a Resurrection in your
Consciences; Oh that you would sit down and pause s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THe fifth and last danger I shall warn you of, is,
Your contempt and slighting of Death. Ah how
light a matter do many of you (at least in words) make
of it? It seems you have little reverential fear of this
King of terrours; not onely that you speak slightly of
it, but also because you make no more preparation for
it, and are no more sensible of your preservations and
deliverances from it. Indeed, the heathen <hi>Philosophers</hi>
did many<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> of them profess a Contempt of Death, upon
the account of Wisdom and Fortitude; and they were
accounted the bravest men, that most despised and
slighted it: But alas, poor Souls, they saw not their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
against whom they taught, but skirmisht with their
eyes shut. They saw indeed its pale face, but not its
sting and dart. There is also a lawful contempt of death:
we freely grant, that in two Cases a believer may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
it; first, when it is propounded to them in a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
on purpose to scare them from Christ and duty,
then they should slight it; as <hi>Rev. 12. 11. They loved not
their lives to the death.</hi> Secondly, When the natural evil
of death is set in Competition with the enjoyment of
God in Glory, then a believer should despise it, as Christ
is said to do, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2 though his was a shameful death.
But upon all other accounts and considerations, it is
the height of stupidity and security to despise it.</p>
                     <p>Now to the end that you might have right thoughts
and apprehensions of death, which may put you upon
serious preparation for it; and that when ever your turn

whose hand the <hi>Pompeys, Caesars,</hi> and <hi>Alexanders</hi> of the

                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Several things concur to make it terrible to
the most of Men<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> As first, its Harbingers and Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents
which are strong Pains, Conflicts, and Agonies.
Secondly, its office and work it comes about, which is
to transfer us into the other world. Hence <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 8.
It's set forth by a <hi>Pale Horse:</hi> An horse, for its use and
office, to carry you away from hence into the upper or
lower region of Eternity; and a pale horse, for it's gast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and terror. Thirdly, but above all, it's terrible
in regard of its consequence; for it's the door of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
the parting point betwixt the present world and
that to come; the utmost line and boundary of all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
things. Hence Heb. 9. <hi>It's appointed for all men once
to die, and after that the Iudgment.</hi> Rev. 6. 8. <hi>And I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and behold a pale Horse, and his name that sat
on him was Death: and Hell followed him.</hi> Ah it makes
a sudden and strange alteration upon mens conditions,
to be pluckt out of house, and from among friends, and
honours, and so many delights, and hurried in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into the Land of Darkness, to be cloathed with
flames, and drink the pure wrath of the Almighty for
ever. This is it, that makes it terrible.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 5. If Death be so weighty a matter, am I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to die?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> I doubt Not; I am afraid I want many things
that are necessary to a <hi>due</hi> preparation for it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 6. What are those things wherein a due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for Death consisteth?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Many things are necessary. First, Special and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Union with Jesus Christ. This is it that disarms it
of its sting; <hi>O Death, where is thy sting? Thanks be to God
who hath given [us] the victo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>y through [our] Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 55, 56. So Joh. 11. 26. <hi>VVho soever
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:32409:109"/>
[liveth] and] [believeth] in me, shall never die.</hi> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
liveth (<hi>i. e.</hi>) is quickned with a new spiritual
Life and Principle, and so puts sorth the principal act
of that life, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith, he shall never die, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally;
This hornet, Death, shall never leave its sting in
his sides. Secondly, To entertain Death comfortably,
the evidence and knowledge of this Union is necessary,
2 Cor. 5. 1. <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>â€¢</desc>
                           </gap>or we [know] that if our earthly house of this
Tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God,</hi> &amp;c.
And then he cannot only be content, but groan to be
uncloathed, <hi>vers.</hi> 2. A mistake in the former will cost me
my Soul; and a mistake here will lose me my peace and
comfort. Thirdly, In order to this evidence<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> it's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
that I keep a good conscience in all things, both
towards God and Man, 2 Cor. 1. 12. <hi>This is our rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
even the testimony of our Conscience, that in sincerity,
and godly simplicity, not in fleshly wisdom, but by the Grace
of God, we have had our conversation in the world.</hi> This
good Conscience respects all and every part of our work
and duty to be done, and all and every sin to be renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and denied: So that he that is early united unto
Christ by Faith, hath the clear evidence of that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and the evidence fairly gathered from the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of a good Conscience, witnessing his faithfulness
as to all duties to be done, and sins to be avoided, he is
fit to die; Death can do him no harm: but alas, these
things are not to be found in me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 7. But what if I die without such a preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as this is, what will the consequence of that be?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Very terrible; even the separation of my Soul
and Body from the Lord to all Eternity, John 3. 36.
<hi>He that believeth on the Son, bath everlasting life; and he
that believeth not the Son, shall not see life: but the wrath
of God abideth on him. He shall not see life:</hi> there's the
privative part of his misery, separation from the blessed
God. <hi>And the [wrath]</hi> mark it, not anger, but wrath;
not the wrath of a man, bat of [<hi>God</hi>] at whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:32409:109"/>
the Mountains skip like frighted men, and the
Hills tremble: The wrath of God not only flashes out
upon him, as a transient flash of lightinng, but [<hi>abideth</hi>]
dwells, sticks fast, there is no power in the world can
loose the soul from it. [<hi>Vpon him</hi>] not the body only,
nor the soul only, but on [<hi>him] (i. e.</hi>) the whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
the whole Man. Here is the principal positive
part of that man's misery.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 8. Can I bear this misery?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> No: My heart cannot endure, nor my hand
be strong, when God shall have to do with me upon
this account. I cannot bear this wrath; Angels could
not bear it; it hath sunk them into the depths of misery.
Those that feel but a few sparks of it in their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences

I have the [may-be's] of mercy, and they have not.
Oh what would they give for a possibility of Salvation!

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> By going to the Lord Jesus Christ, Rom. 8. 1.
<hi>There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in
Christ Iesus.</hi> Rom. 8. 33, 34. <hi>Who shall lay any thing to

that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea, rather that is

but go, the Father ran: if he had but received him into

exprest himself to returning <hi>Ephraim. My Bowels are
troubled for him: I will surely have mercy on him,</hi> Jerem. 31.
20. There is not the least Parenthesis in all the pages of
Free Grace, to exclude a Soul that is sincerely willing

                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 13. But how may it appear that he is willing
to receive me?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Make trial of him thy self. If thou did but
know his heart to poor sinners, you would not question
it. Believe what he saith in the Gospel; there thou shalt
find that he is a willing Saviour: for therein thou hast,
First his most serious invitations, <hi>Matth. 11. 28. Come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me ye that are weary and heavy laden.</hi> Isai. 55. 1. <hi>Ho, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters.</hi> These seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Invitations are, Secondly, backt and confirmed with
his Oath, <hi>Ezek. 35. 11. As I live I desire not the death of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
Thirdly, amplified with pathetical wishes, sighs and
groans, <hi>Matth. 23. 29. Oh that thou hadst known, even thou,
at least in this thy day.</hi> Fourthly, Yea, delivered to them
in undissembled tears, <hi>Matth. 23. 37, 38. He wept over it,
and said, O Ierusalem, Ierusalem.</hi> Fifthly, Nay, he hath
shed not only tears, but blood, to convince thee of his
willingness. View him in his dying posture upon the
Cross, stretching out his dying arms to gather thee,
hanging down his blessed head to kiss thee: every one
of his wounds was a mouth opened to convince thee of
the abundant willingness of Christ to receive thee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 14. But my sins are died in grain: I am a sinner of

                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea, Soul, if thou be willing to commit thy self
to him, Isai. 1. 18. <hi>Come, now let us reason together: Though
your sins he as scarlet, I will make them as snow; though they
be red like crimson, I will make them as wool.</hi> See <hi>p.</hi> 10, 11.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 25. This is comfortable news; but may I not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:32409:111"/>
delay my closing with him for a while, and yet not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
my eternal happiness, seeing I resolve to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him at last?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> No. There must be no delays in this case: Ps. 119.
60. <hi>I made hast and delayed not to keep thy commandments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> 16. Why may I not defer it, at least for a little
while?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> For many weighty reasons this work can bear no
delays. First, the offers of Grace are made to the present
time, Heb. 3. 15. <hi>Wbile it's said to day, harden not your heart.</hi>
There may be a few more days of God's patience, but
that is unknown to thee. Secondly, your Life is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
uncertain; how many thousands are gone into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
since the last Night? If you can say to sickness
when it comes, Go, and come again another time, it
were somewhat. Thirdly, Sin is not a thing to be
dallied whith. Oh! who would be willing to lie down
one Night under the guilt of all his sins? Fourthly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays
increase the difficulty of Conversion: Sin still roots
itself deeper, habits are the more strengthened, and the
heart still more hardned. Fifthly, There be thousands
now in Hell, that perish through delays: Their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
often urged and prest hard upon them, and many
resolutions they had, as thou hast now; but they were
never perfected by answerable executions, and so they
perisht. Sixthly, Thy way of sinning now is desperate;
for every moment thou art acting against clear light and
conviction; and that is a dreadful way of sinning. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly,
There can be no solid reason for one hours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay;
for thou canst not be happy too soon: And be sure
of it, if ever thou come to taste the sweetness of a Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Life, nothing will more pierce and grieve thee
than this, that thou enjoyedst it no sooner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Qu.</hi> 17. Oh, but the pleasures of sin engage me to it,
how shall I break these cords and snares?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> That snare may be broken by considering so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
these five things. First, that to take pleasure in
sin, is an argument of a most deplorable and wretched
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:32409:111"/>
state of Soul. What a poysonful nature doth it argue
in a Toad, that is sucking in nothing but poyson and
filth wherever he crawls! Oh what an heart hast thou!
hast thou nothing to find pleasure in, but that which
makes the Spirit of Christ sad, and the hearts of Saints
ache and groan; which digged Hell, and let in endless
miseries upon the world? Secondly, think that the misery
it involves thee in, is infinitely beyond the delights it
tempts thee by: It doth but delight the sensual part and
that but with a brutish pleasure; but will torment thy
immortal Soul, and that for ever. The pleasure will
quickly go off, but the sting will remain behind. <hi>I tasted
but a little honey on the top of my rod</hi> (said <hi>Ionathan) and I
must die,</hi> 1 Sam. 14. 43. Thirdly, Nay, that's not all; but the
Lord proportions wrath according to the pleasures souls
have had in sin, <hi>Rev. 18. 7. How much she hath lived deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously,
so much torment and sorrow give unto her.</hi> Fourthly,
What dost thou pay, or, at least, pawn, for this pleasure?
Thy soul, thy precious soul, is laid to stake for it: and in
effect thus thou sayest, when thou deferrest the closing
with Christ upon the account of enjoying the pleasures
of sin a little longer: Here, Devil, take my Soul into thy
possession and power; if I repent, I will have it again;
if not, it is thine for ever. Oh dearb ought pleasures!</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>What is the the world? A great exchange of ware,</l>
                        <l>Wherein all Sorts and Sexes cheapning are:</l>
                        <l>The Flesh, the Devils, sit and, cry What lack ye?</l>
                        <l>When most thay fawn, they most intend to rack ye.</l>
                        <l>The wares are cups of joy, and beds of pleasure;</l>
                        <l>There's goodly choice, down-weight, and flowing measure.</l>
                        <l>A soul's the price, but they give time to pay</l>
                        <l>Vpon the Death-bed, or the Dying-day.</l>
                        <l>Hard is the bargain, and unjust the measure,</l>
                        <l>When as the price so much outlasts the pleasure.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <bibl>Quarles.</bibl>
                     <p>Lastly, It's thy gross mistake to think thou shalt be
bereaven of all delights and pleasures, by coming under
the government of Christ: For one of those things in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:32409:112"/>
which his Kingdom consists, is joy in the Holy Ghost, <hi>Rom.</hi>
14. 17. Indeed, it allows no sinful pleasures to the subjects
of it, nor do they need it; but from the day thou closest
in with Christ, all thy pure, real, and eternal pleasures
and delight begin and bear date<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> When the Prodigal
was return'd to his Father, then, saith the Text, <hi>They
began to be merry,</hi> Luke 15. 24. See <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 5, 6. No, no,
Soul, thou shalt want no joy; for the Scripture saith, <hi>They
shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house, and
thou shalt make them drink the rivers of thy pleasures; for with
thee is the fountain of light,</hi> &amp;c. Psal. 36. 8, 9.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Qu.</hi> 18. But how shall I be able to undergo the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
of Religion? There are difficult Duties to be done,
and an heavy cross to be taken up; these be the things
that daunt me.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> If Pain and Suffering daunt thee, how is it thou
art not more out of love with sin than with Religion?
For it is most certain, that the Sufferings for Christ are
nothing to Hell, the just reward and certain issue of sin:
the pains of Mortification are nothing to the pains of
Damnation. There is no compare betwixt suffering for
Christ, and suffering from Christ, Matth. 5. 29. <hi>If thy
right hand, or eye offend thee, cut it off, and pluck it out: It is
profitable for thee that one member suffer, than that the whole
body be cast into Hell.</hi> Secondly, thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eest the worst, but
not the best of Christ. There be Joys and Comforts in
those difficult Duties and Sufferings, that thou seest not.
Col. 1. 24. <hi>Who now rejoice in my sufferings.</hi> Jam. 1. 2. <hi>My
Brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into diverstemptations,</hi>
&amp;c. Thirdly, Great shall be thy assistance from Christ,
<hi>Phil. 4. 13. I can do all things through him that strengthens
me. The Spirits helps our infirmities,</hi> takes the other end
of the burden, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. What meanest thou to stand
upon such terms, when it is Heaven or Hell, eternal
Life or Death, that lie before thee?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Qu.</hi> 19. But to what purpose will all my endeavours
to come to Christ be? unless I be elected, all will be to
on purpose.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:32409:112"/>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> True: If thou be not elected, thou canst not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him, or happiness by him: But yet, that is no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to strive. For in thy unconverted state, thy
Election or Non-election is a secret to thee; the only way
to make it sure, is by striving and giving all diligence in
the way of duty, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. And if you ponder the text
well, you will find, that Election is not only made sure
in the way of diligence and striving; but Calling is put
before it, and lies in order to it. First secure thy effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Calling, and then thine Election.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Qu.</hi> 20. But I have no strength of my own to come
to Christ by; and is it not absurd to urge me upon Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities
in order to my Salvation?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> First, Certainly you are more absurd in plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and pretending your impotence against your duty:
for you do think you have a power to come to Christ,
else how do you quiet your Conscience with Promises
and solves of Conversion hereafter? Secondly, Though
it be true, that no saving Act can be done without the
concurrence of special Grace; yet this is as true, that
thy inability to do what is above thy power, doth not
excuse thee from doing what is in thy power to do.
Canst thou not forbear, at least, many external acts of
sin? And canst thou not perform, at least, the external
acts of duty? Oh, if thou canst not come to Christ, yet, as
the blind man, lie in the way of Christ; do what thou
canst do, and confess and bewail thine impotency that
thou canst do no more. Canst thou not take thy Soul aside
in secret, and thus bemoan it; My poor Soul, what wilt
thou do? Oh what will become of thee, thou art Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
Covenantless, Hopeless, and, which is most sad, sens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and bowelless. O! thou canst not bear the infinite
Wrath of the Eternal God, whose Almighty Power will
be set on work to torment such as thou art, and yet thou
takest no course to prevent it. Thou seest the busie dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of all others, and how the Kingdom of Heaven
suffers violence by them; and art not thou as deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:32409:113"/>
to look to thy own happiness, as any in the world?
Will Hell be more tolerable to thee than others? Oh
what a composition of stupidity and sloth art thou?
Thou livest after such a rate, as if there were neither
Fire in Hell to torment thee, nor Glory in Heaven to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thee. If God and Christ, Heaven and Hell, were
but dreams and fables, thou couldst not be less affected
with them. Ah, my Soul! my Soul! my precious Soul!
Is it easie to perish? Wilt thou die as a fool dieth? Oh
that men would but do thus, if they can do no more!</p>
                     <p>And now, Soul, you see what death is, that you have
made so slight of; and what is the only way that we, poor
Sons of Death, have to escape its sting. You have here
seen the vanity of all your pleas and pretences against
Conversion, and the way to Christ prepared and cast up
for you. Now, Sirs, I beg you in the name of God that
made you, and as if I made this request upon my bended
Knees to you, that you will now, without any more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,
yield your selves to the Lord. Soul! I beseech thee,
hast thee into thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>hamber, shut thy door, and bespeak
the Lord after some such manner as this, before thou
darest to launch out into the Deeps again:</p>
                     <p>O dreadful and glorious Majesty! thou hast bowels
of mercy, as well as beams of glory: I have heard the
sounding of these bowels for me this day. Lord, I have
now heard a representation of the grim and ghastly face
of Death! Ah! I have now seen it as the King of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
as the door of Eternity, as the Parting-point, where
sinners take their eternal farewel of all their delights. I
have seen this black Prince mounted on his pale Horse,
and Hell following him. I have been convinced this
day, that if he should come and fetch away my Soul in
that condition it is, Hell would follow him indeed. Lord!
I have now heard of the Prince of Life also, in whose
bleeding side Death hath left and lost its envenomed
sting; so that though it may kill, yet it cannot hurt any
of his Members. To this glorious Redeemer I have now
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:32409:113"/>
been invited; all my pretences against him have been
confuted, and my Soul in his Name assured of welcome,
if I come unto him, and cast my self upon him. And
now, Lord, I come, I come, upon thy call and invitation;
I am unfeignedly willing to avouch thee, this day to be
my God, and to take thee for my portion. Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi>
I come unto thee; thy Clay, thy Creature moves towards
the Fountain of pity, look hitherto: Behold a spectacle
of misery. Bowels of mercy, hear, behold my naked Soul,
not a rag of righteousness to cover it; behold my starv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Soul, not a bit of bread for you to eat; ah! it has fed
upon wind and vanity hitherto: Behold my wounded
soul bleeding at thy foot; every part, Head and Heart,
Will and Affections, all wounded by sin. O thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
<hi>Samaritan,</hi> turn aside, and pour thy Soveraign
blood into these bleeding wounds, which like so many
opened mouths plead for pity. Behold a returning
submitting Rebel, willing to lay down the weapons of
unrighteousness, and to come upon the knee for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
Oh I am weary of the service of sin; I can endure
it no longer. Lord Jesus, thou wast anointed to preach
glad tidings to the meek, and to proclaim liberty to the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>aptives, and the opening of the prison to them that are
bound. Come now, and knock off those fetters of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;
Oh set my soul at liberty that it may praise thee!
For so many years Satan hath cruelly tyrannized over
me, oh that this might be the acceptable year of the
Lord, and the day of the salvation of my God! Lord, thou
wast lifted up to draw Men unto thee; and indeed thou
art a drawing Saviour, a lovely Jesus. I have hitherto
slighted thee, but it was because I did not know thee:
mine eyes have been held by unbelief, when thou wast
opened in the Gospel; but now I see thee as the chiefest
of ten thousands. Thou art the glory of Heaven,
the glory of Earth, the glory of <hi>Sion;</hi> and oh
that thou wouldst be the glory of my Soul! I confess,
I am not worthy that thou shouldst look upon me; I
may much rather expect to be trampled under the feet
<pb facs="tcp:32409:114"/>
of Justice, than to be embraced in thine arms of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
and that thou shouldst rather shed my polluted
blood, than sprinkle thine own upon me. But Lord,
what profit is there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap> my blood? Wilt thou pursue a
dryed leaf? Shall it ever be said, that the merciful
King of Heaven hang'd up a poor soul that put the
rope about its own neck, and so came selfcondemning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to him fot mercy? O my Lord! I am willing to
submit to any terms, be they never so hard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
to the flesh. I am sure whatever I shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in thy service, cannot be like to what I have suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or am like to fuffer by sin: henceforth be thou my
Lord and Master; thy service is perfect freedom; be
thou my Priest and Prophet, my Wisdom and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
I resign up my self unto thee: my poor Soul
with all its faculties, my body with all its members,
to be living instruments of thy glory. Let <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the Lord</hi> be now written upon them all; let my
tongue henceforth plead for thee, my hands be lifted
up unto thy testimonies, my feet walk in thy ways.
Oh let all my affections, as willing servants, wait upon
thee, and be active for thee. Whatever I am, let me
be for thee; whatever I have; let it be thine; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I can do, let me do for thee; whatever I can suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
let me suffer for thee. O that I might say before
I go hence, My beloved is mine, and I am his! Oh
that what I have begged on Earth, might be ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Heaven! My Spirit within me saith, <hi>Amen.</hi>
Lord Jesus, say thou. <hi>Amen.</hi>
