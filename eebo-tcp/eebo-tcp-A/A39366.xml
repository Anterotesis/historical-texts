            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <byline>By <hi>Edmund Elys,</hi> a Servant of Jeſus Chriſt.</byline>
            <p>I Have not ſeen <hi>John Elliot's</hi> Book, but <hi>Charity</hi> obliges me to believe, That what he hath therein Aſſerted, is Agreeable to the Sentiments of a great number of thoſe Men call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> whoſe Writings I have Read, or with whom I have had ſome Perſonal Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And therefore I cannot doubt, but when he ſays, <hi>That GRACE is an Increated Being;</hi> by <hi>Grace</hi> he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands the <hi>True Light, which enlighteneth every Man that cometh into the World,</hi> conſider'd as the Fountain of all GRACE, <hi>viz.</hi> of all Holy Inclinations, Diſpoſitions or Operations in the Souls of Men, which are call'd by the Bleſſed Apoſtle, <hi>The Fruit of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5. <q>Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gentleneſs, Goodneſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Temperance;</q>
               <hi>Theſe</hi> Words of <hi>John Elliot's</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:109398:2"/>
               <hi>Antagoniſt,</hi> His INCREATED BEING in All, A Great Nothing, I Abhor, <hi>as words written</hi> by the <hi>Inſtigation of the DEVIL: To whoſe</hi> Suggeſtions alſo I impute a Multitude of the Conceits that have been Publiſh'd by that Perſon, whom he calls, (30.) <hi>Holy and Learned</hi> Flavel. I deſire, that the Candid Reader would peruſe <hi>Clement Lake's</hi> Letters to <hi>John Flavel:</hi> And a Paper, Entituled, <q>
                  <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon ſeveral Paſſages in a Book Intituled The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of a Perſonal Reformation; and the Neceſſity of Converſion.</hi>
               </q> And ſo I Diſmiſs. <hi>J. Flavel</hi> for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and return to this other, <hi>J. E.</hi> P. 3. <q>The Eternal Spirit, <hi>ſays he,</hi> the third Perſon of the Trinity, and that which is in every Man, are not diſtinct, but Eſſentially one: There's Divinity for you.</q> 
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Moſt certainly the Third Perſon of the Trinity is not eſſentially diſtinct from the <hi>True Light,</hi> which is in <hi>every Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P. 4. <q>Thoſe Texts of Scripture, that ſpeak of the Spirits being, or dwelling in Believers, are not to be underſtood of an <hi>Hypoſtatical</hi> or <hi>Perſonal Union</hi> between the Spirit and them.</q> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Without doubt, theſe Texts of Scripture are not to be ſo underſtood; for then we ſhould ſuppoſe, that the Spirit and Believers ſhould be but <hi>one Perſon:</hi> for <hi>Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is</hi> the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of divers Natures in one Perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If the Perſon of the Spirit, <hi>ſays he,</hi> be in every individual Believer, then every individual Believer is two Perſons</q> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny this Conſequence: Becauſe the Perſon of the Spirit is not in a Believer ſo as to become the Perſon of the Believer; but having that Eſſence, which is <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Infinite,</hi> He is in all Creatures, but in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in all rational Souls; <hi>convincing</hi> all of their ſinful Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Inclinations, and <hi>converting</hi> or turning from Sin all thoſe, that do not perſiſt in their Rebellion againſt the <hi>Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If there be a perſonal Inhabitation of the Spirit in Believers (ſays this Diſputer) there is alſo a Perſonal Inhabitation of the Father, and of the Son in them, 1 <hi>John 4. 15, 16. Gal. 2. 20. John</hi> 17. 23. The
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109398:2"/>
latter is abſurd; therefore, alſo the former.</q> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Moſt certainly the three Perſons, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt (the only true, and Eternal God, Infinite <hi>Light,</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite <hi>Love)</hi> dwells in the Heart of every true Believer.</p>
            <p>P. 8. 9. <q>All that are in Chriſt, are throughly and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally renew'd: Whoever they are, that are not thus throughly and univerſally renew'd, are not yet in Chriſt: And whatever falls ſhort of this, is called by a wrong name, if it is called <hi>Grace.</hi> If they that are in Chriſt, are new Creatures, then Grace in Believers is no Increated, but a Created Being.</q> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If they that are in Chriſt, are New Creatures, then there is in Believers, or thoſe that are in Chriſt, the <hi>Principle or Fountain of New Life,</hi> which is the only <hi>Life</hi> of Rational Creatures, as Rational. The Fountain of Life is the TRUE LIGHT, which is the one infinite, increated Being</p>
            <p>
               <q>P. 10. The humane Nature of Chriſt, <hi>ſays this Flavelite,</hi> is a greater Excellency, than any thing that is in Believers: The humane Nature of Chriſt is no increated Being; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, much leſs any thing that is in Believers.</q> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nothing that is in Believers as a <hi>Part, Property,</hi> or any kind of <hi>Quality,</hi> is <hi>Increated:</hi> But if Chriſt be the only true God, and God be a <hi>Being abſolutely Infinite;</hi> it muſt needs follow, That he is in all Creatures, and in a peculiar manner, in all Rational Souls; eſpecially in the Souls of Believers, in that he does not only <hi>Convince</hi> their <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings</hi> of the Truth, but <hi>Convert</hi> their <hi>Wills</hi> to the <hi>Will</hi> of God in all things; ſo that with the <hi>Will,</hi> or <hi>Rational Appetite,</hi> they do not <hi>Affect</hi> or <hi>abſolutely Incline</hi> to any thing but <hi>GOD:</hi> They do not <hi>incline</hi> to any <hi>Finite Object,</hi> but only <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>with Reference to God,</hi> The Fountain of all Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>P. 22. <q>Grace may be overpower'd by Corruption.</q> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a moſt Pernicious Error, deſtructive of the true Notion of the <hi>Grace of God, that bringeth Salvation,</hi> Titus 2. 11. Whenſoever our Souls are in a Gracious, or Holy Temper, they act in the Power of the <hi>True Light</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:109398:3"/>
which is <hi>Almighty,</hi> and can never be withſtood by the <hi>Power of Darkneſs</hi> in <hi>our Senſitive Faculties,</hi> whilſt our <hi>Will</hi> is ſincerely concurrent with it: So that every Act of true Grace, or Holineſs, implies an <hi>Averſion</hi> from all <hi>known Sin,</hi> and a <hi>Rational</hi> Propenſity or Inclination to all that we know to be the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that we ſhould either <hi>do</hi> or <hi>ſuffer.</hi> I ſay, or <hi>ſuffer,</hi> for this is a Property of <hi>True Grace,</hi> that it makes the <hi>Objects of our ſenſible Averſion</hi> to become the <hi>Objects</hi> of our <hi>Volition, or Rational Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> being the Effects of the <hi>Divine Will,</hi> the boundleſs Fountain of all <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Intellectual Satisfaction.</hi>
