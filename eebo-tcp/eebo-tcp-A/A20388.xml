            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> to the D. D. of <hi>Aberdeene,</hi> concerning the late Declaration given to his Majesties <hi>Commissioner,</hi> did flow from minds filled with a zeale to the peace of this Kirk &amp; Kingdome, and from our earnest desires of a perfect har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, betwixt the King and his Subjects against all <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings.</hi> This zeale of ours wee confesse made us studie more, how to decline and to keepe our selves from touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such of the D. D. demands as were thornie, than howe to walke safely through them. And likewise to make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest to his Majesties good Subjects in all places whether the D. D. demands, and our answeres should happen to come. That matters inclined to pacification, and were in a faire way off setling: for which peaceable intentions we could conceive nothing to bee more behovefull, than by word and write to make knowne to all men the forsaid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, which his Majesties loyall Subjects presented to his Majesties <hi>Commissionar,</hi> for clearing their <hi>Covenant</hi> of all unlawfull Combination against <hi>Authoritie.</hi> And by so doing, to stoppe the mouthes of our <hi>Adversaries,</hi> and to stay all their obloquies. In using of this meane, it was far from our thoughts to wound anye man, or to write anye word, which might give the smallest offence to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest of his Majesties Subjects, Hoping rather that these our proceedings should have beene more acceptable to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,</hi> more approven of the wife and men of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and more aggreable unto the minds of such as are for peace; than rashly and unadvisedly to have gone on in a Dispute of <hi>State questions,</hi> which hardly at any time hath beene profitable for peace, and which at this time seemed to us (to say no further) most unseasonable &amp; impertinent. Yet knowing that it were not only base and shamefull, but in our persons, and in our proceedings in this cause, a very great incongruitie, and in it selfe sinfull, to speake wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly for GOD, and to talke deceitfullie for him, for that were as one man mocketh another so to mocke him. <hi>Iob.</hi> 13. 7. 9. and to make iniquitie a meane to promove <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:23673:3"/>
(a policie which wee have not learned,) as if GOD could bee served with our sinnes. Wee have made heere a briefe relation of the reasons &amp; grounds, where-upon wee have in our answeres confidently affirmed, that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties <hi>Commissionar</hi> did accept, and was well pleased with the late Declaration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His G. was most earnest to have the late <hi>Covenant</hi> so solemnely sworne, and so universally subscribed to bee rendred, or rescinded, and did propone plausible reasons for that effect. But this by such strong impediments as were at that time represented, and are now extant in print, being impossible to us to doe, except wee wold sin highly against God. His G. afterward declared that the Kings Majesty was most willing to indict an Assembly &amp; call a <hi>Parliament,</hi> but that our <hi>Covenant</hi> in the clause of mutuall defence, was a combination against <hi>Authoritie,</hi> and that we had sworne to defend one another in our owne private quarrells, aswel as in the cause of Religion. This his G. desired to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, as a maine hinderance of the obtaining of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and without the removall whereof an Assembly, and <hi>Parliament</hi> could not be indicted. When this motion of a Declaration was first proponed to the severall meetings the greater part was against it: because no Declaration, containing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ye thing contrarie to the <hi>Covenant</hi> could bee granted, and an explanation of the Covenant, the meaning whereof seemed to be plaine enough, would no more please than the Covenant it self: but by the earnest dealing of some Noblemen of his Majesties Counsell sent from the <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner,</hi> with some Commissioners sent from everie meeting, It was thought meet in end, that a Supplication containing a Declaration should bee formed, which at last his G. did receive at the hands of the Supplicants, and upon the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thereof promised to deale with the Kings Majestie for obtaining a free Assembly and Parliament, which he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to undertake without this Declaration. Thus by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nature and course of our Proceedings about this point, it
<pb facs="tcp:23673:3"/>
is manifest that the Declaration was, at least in this farre sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorie to the <hi>Commissioner</hi> himselfe, that hee did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to mediate for an Assembly and Parliament, which was both the summe of our desires, and the onely end of this Declaration. So that no man could in any reason think that we should have wronged him in affirming that his G. did accept, and was well pleased with that Declaration since upon the sight, receiving, and hearing thereof, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to doe his best endeavours with his Majestie for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining what was petitioned by us, which before and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, his G. had utterly refused to doe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The three Noble-men of his Majesties Counsell who were imployed by his G. about this Declaration, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ordinarly to him for advysing what forme of Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration would best please, and give best satisfaction. And we had great reason to think that the forme which pleased their Lorships should not be displeasing, or unacceptable to his G.</p>
            <p n="3">3. After that diverse formes of Declaration were drawn up, and none of them was found to give satisfaction: at last it was thought good, that one should bee formed by waye of Supplication for a generall Assembly and Parliament.</p>
            <p>And because the maine hinderance of obtaining thereof, was that our <hi>Covenant</hi> was suspect to be a combination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Authoritie,</hi> it was found necessare that this impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should bee removed by declaring that no such thing was intended in the <hi>Covenant.</hi> This forme of Supplication did first please the three Noble-men, and thereafter, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse parts and expressions of it were corrected by his G. particular direction, which are still keeped in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, &amp; in the notes of the Noblemen and others at that time imployed about this work fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their several meetings. This made us to think that his G. was well pleased with so much as was corrected by himself, and that his G. would have also corrected other parts &amp; expressions thereof, if hee had not bene well pleased with them: and therfore made
<pb facs="tcp:23673:4"/>
us secure that his G. would no have offended that we or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, shuld have affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> so much.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Wee have reason to think that the first Declaration which was showne to the Petitioners by the three Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men sent from his G. to negotiate with them, would have given satisfaction; why then shall wee not think, that the Supplication mended by his owne particular direction, not in the Petitorie part, but in the Declaration which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, might in like manner satisfie.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Among other partes of the Declaration which were mended by the Commissioners direction, One was in the beginning thereof, where, in place of that which was first written <hi>That the Kings Majestie bad conceived the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Fayth</hi> and <hi>Covenant lately renewed by us his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Subjects to bee an unlawfull combination against Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie:</hi> His G. would have it changed thus, <hi>That his Majesties Commissioner hath conceived the Confession of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. Wee might therefore have imagined that the Kings Majestie possibly would not have beene pleased with our Declaration, but it could not so much as enter in our minds that his Majesties <hi>Commissioner,</hi> who would have the words to expresse his owne dislike, and not the Kings, should not for his owne part beene pleased with it, or bee offended with us, for affirming so much.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There was some reasoning between the three Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers and the Petitioners, whether the words of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration should bee thus conceived, <hi>amaine Hinderance,</hi> or, <hi>the mains Hinderance,</hi> for which later conception the Petitioners did plead, That this which was the maine hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance being removed by their declaration, for which end they were moved to make it, ther might bee no more hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances afterward, or at lest so small ones, that they might easily be put out of the way; and the trueth is, that since the removall of that main hinderance, we have heard of no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulare hinderance from the contents of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> This also did make us to say with the greater confidence that the Declaration did please.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb facs="tcp:23673:4"/>
7. When the Declaration was received by his Majesties Commissioner, was read openly, and was confirmed hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the oath of the petitioner. His G. declared that hee verily believed that they meaned what they spake, that hee hoped what they had written should prove satisfactorie to his Majestie, and that hee would against the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted do his best endeavours with his Majestie for obtaining our desires, which could not but make us conceive that his G. was satisfied with it himself.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Although all the companies of petitioners could not bee present to hear with their own eares, the words that were spoken, yet all of them had so much as we have written, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported unto them, not by uncertaine rumour, but by the faithfulnesse of their Commissioners; and upon the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this report, and certaine evidences of the trueth, they rested satisfied, and were put in hope of a generall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at the <hi>Commissioner</hi> his returne. Which hath made them also now in their answers to the last of the late propositions made unto them by his Majesties <hi>Commissioner</hi> after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, to affirme, that his G. accepted their Declaration as the most ready &amp; powerfull mean, which could come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compasse of their thoughts, for clearing them of that objected Combination, lykeas they have testified no lesse in their letters to others. So that if wee have erred in our affirmation, we have not erred alone, but have beene car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried awaye with the common errour of so many as were heere conveened, without exception of any one.</p>

If the Act of approbation with the Subscriptions thereof, (the ground of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive) was torne and rescinded and the missive it selfe, once thought fitte to bee sent, was returned and promise given, that it should not be sent, there was no lesse done than was assevered by us.

When it was requyred by the Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, that another Act should bee made bearing, that by their subscribing the Proclamation they had not given their Approbation to it, It was often and at large answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they did not by their Subscription approve the Proclamation, but onely gave warrant thereby to the Clerke for registration, and to the Herauld for publishing the same. And thirdly the Supplicants presented a petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on containing the reasons of their desires, and could not bee satisfied, except upon these reasons the Act were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinded, and the missive stayed. This Supplication was received by the <hi>Commissioner,</hi> was openly reade, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere was given by his G. that their desire should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.

<pb facs="tcp:23673:8"/>
or have beene threatned with the <hi>want of their stipends,</hi> for the refusing their <hi>Subscription:</hi> but this wee have heard, that some of them have of their owne accord, gone to Court, for procuring of <hi>Protections</hi> against their <hi>Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,</hi> and against the <hi>Lawes,</hi> and <hi>Duetie</hi> of good Subjects, have made <hi>Lies</hi> between the King and his people. Others wee knowe have wilfully refused, to abyde with their flock: and beeing eranestly entreated by them, to attend their <hi>Charge,</hi> have left them, and haue gone out of the Countrie, for no reason, but because the people had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, and as ye know, that <hi>Arguments</hi> have beene taken from <hi>augmentation of stipends,</hi> to hinder <hi>Subscription:</hi> so ye may know, That <hi>feare of worldy losse,</hi> rather hindereth men to subscribe, than <hi>scruple of conscience.</hi> The Prelates flight, seemeth rather to have proceeded from inward furies of accusing consciences, or for feare of a storme, (which beeing procured by their owne doing, may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily prognosticated by them) than from the inforcing of <hi>Subscription</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which in our knowledge was never required of any of the Prelates, although they bee grosslie guiltie of the breach of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which they did sweare, and subscribe before. 3. Your helpe, by your prayers, and other meanes, for extinguishing of the present <hi>Combustion,</hi> wee still desire, but withall intreat, that you would both ioyn with the rest of the kirks of the Kingdome, in publick humiliation and fasting, which the Lord himselfe doeth proclaime, and call for at this time; so should your prayers bee the more effectuall, and also yee bee good instruments, according to your power, with your owne people, and the countrey about, to joyne in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> so should yee find the worke of <hi>Pacification</hi> the more easie. 4. The <hi>Reasons</hi> which wee touched in our <hi>Answere,</hi> for proving, that ye might, without iust offence to anye, joyne with us in subscribing, are not yet answered for, first, a sound <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> although proceeding from a private person, and altogether voyde

of externall <hi>Authoritie,</hi> can not make a substantiall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: and if the <hi>Interpretation</hi> bee unsound, although it were confirmed with <hi>Authoritie,</hi> it maketh not a substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall co-incidence. 2. Why is it denyed, that the former <hi>Covenant</hi> containeth <hi>Mutuall defence,</hi> since all are oblied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thereby to defend <hi>Religion,</hi> according to their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and power, and the King's person and authoritie, which can not possiblie bee done without <hi>Mutuall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:</hi> and since that clause of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> is so expo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

What was done by his Majesties <hi>Commissionar,</hi> was not done in a corner, that it needeth to bee pryed into, or doubted of, and what was allowed by his grace, who had so great power from his Majestie, to declare his Majesties will, and to receive <hi>Declarations</hi> from his Subjects, and who was in every point so zealous, and tender of his Majesties service and honour: who are yee, that it should be disallowed by you?

without the bounds of our Calling, to take upon us, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Declaration of that kynd, especiallie wherein so manie things are reprooveable; as first, That his bitter speaches were occasioned by some printed bookes, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that <hi>Episcopacie</hi> and <hi>Perth Articles,</hi> were antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian and abominable.

For Master <hi>Knox</hi> spared not, (in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his) to call this Kneeling, <hi>A Diabolicall invention.</hi> Secoudly; The swearing of forbearance of the practise of <hi>Perth articles</hi> &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation of the said doctrine which wee neither deny, nor affirme, to bee imported in the olde <hi>Covenant,</hi> but onelie in the <hi>interpretation</hi> thereof, wee de clare.
